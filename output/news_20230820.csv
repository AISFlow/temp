They are responsible for big moves that send ripples through the digital world. Whale Alert, a blockchain tracking and analytics tool, recently found out about a huge transfer of 253,419,377 DOGE from Robinhood to an unknown wallet. This brought these mysterious entities back into the spotlight, as they always do. As this transaction happens against the background of Dogecoin’s unwavering resilience in the middle of volatile market shifts, the actions of these (can we say “hoarders?”) come to represent not only the power to shape trends but also the mystery that surrounds their intentions. 🚨 253,419,377 #DOGE (16,052,287 USD) transferred from #Robinhood to unknown wallethttps://t.co/xlyzOzqFFQ — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 18, 2023 Whale Alert says that a big holder who hasn’t been named withdrew a large amount of DOGE, which at the time of the transaction was worth an impressive $16 million. Dogecoin Whale In Action This large transfer of money came from Robinhood and went to an unknown wallet. Its location was kept secret to protect the privacy of the people involved, unsurprisingly.

DOGE market cap at $9.11 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com Even though DOGE’s path has been marked by its natural volatility, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency is showing that it can go against market sentiment and start price movements in the right direction again. This shows that Dogecoin is still popular and has the ability to get people’s attention, solidifying it as a major player in the cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, DOGE was selling at $0.064, which is down nearly 16% in the last week. The cryptocurrency market as a whole lost a lot of money over the weekend, which hurt the joke coin by only 1.3% in the last 24 hours. DOGE price action on a weekend.

Hedera has not only held its place despite the volatile circumstances that frequently affect other digital assets, but has also shown steady resilience. At the time of writing, HBAR emerged as the only crypto in the top 50 ranking with the highest increase in the seven-day timeframe at 15%.

Additionally, the examination of Hedera’s price patterns using its technical indicators and moving averages displays a convincing sequence of strong buy signals. This line-up of indicators supports the idea that market forces are advantageously positioned to promote the price growth of Hedera. Bright Prospects For HBAR Analysts are continuing to have a bullish stance on Hedera’s prospects in light of these significant developments. They have reason to be optimistic since they anticipate a price increase that might push Hedera’s value up to the anticipated target of $0.065 by the end of August. HBAR weekly price performance.
