According to the state-backed news source TASS, Moiseev – who previously said that bitcoin should be classified as a kind of asset in Russia and limited to qualified investors – told reporters on Monday that ""no regulator doubts that payments will be banned.""  That comment aside, further statements from Moiseev on the matter suggest that the question is still an open one subject to debate in the State Duma, Russia's national legislature.  ""The discussions will continue. I think that within the framework of these discussions we will decide what we will do with it,"" he said, going on to remark:  ""In any case, there is a market. It is developing rapidly, and there are certain advantages that could be used. I mean the advantages associated with attracting investments for projects through the ICO. I have a positive attitude to this, but there is another point of view. In order to make a decision, consensus will be necessary.""  Moiseev said that he expects a long-in-the-crafting bill to be completed in October, though given past developments in Russia, the bill could conceivably see further delays. Even still, the deputy finance minister indicated that further deliberations in the Duma will decide what ends up in the finalized measure.  ""I think we will determine it within a month.

""This is an area where I’m concerned about what’s going to happen to retail investors,"" he was quoted as saying.  And recent actions by the agency support Clayton's stated fears. On Tuesday, the SEC unveiled a new cyber unit dedicated in part to policing ""violations involving distributed ledger technology and initial coin offerings.""  It was earlier this summer that the SEC formally outlined its intention to police activities around ICOs, declaring that it would consider tokens issued in such sales as securities offerings in some instances.  As part of that release, the SEC revealed the findings of an investigation into The DAO, the ethereum-based funding vehicle that collapsed in the summer of 2016 following a fatal code exploit.  ""U.S. federal securities law may apply to various activities, including distributed ledger technology, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, without regard to the form of the organization or technology used to effectuate a particular offer or sale,"" the agency said at the time.

In a note to clients, obtained by Business Insider, Shvetz then directly took on the allegation that bitcoin is a ""fraud"" – advanced by Dimon earlier this month.  ""If one describes Bitcoin as a fraud, how would one describe a 'financial cloud' that is at least four to five times larger than the underlying economies?"" Shvetz asked, writing:  ""It is unlikely that $400 trillion+ of financial instruments circulating around the world would ever be repaid and most are now backed by assets that are already either worthless or are diminishing in value. How does one describe rates and the yield curve that are either directly determined by [central banks] ([Bank of Japan] or [People's Bank of China]) or heavily influenced by them ([The] Fed or [European Central Bank])? People living in glass houses should not throw stones.""

42400477,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJgi8,1506620128,Bull Trap? Bitcoin Prices Struggle to Build Momentum Above Moving Average,"Despite rising above its 50-day moving average again today, the bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is having a hard time gaining altitude.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at $4,188, down from a high of $4,269 earlier today; its highest level since September 12. Week-on-week, BTC is up 14.4%, while month-on-month it is still nursing 5.5% loss.  Still, with no clear news or technical drivers, there is cause for concern that a potential ""bull trap"" is developing. With prices failing to build on the overnight bullish break, caution is likely to seep into the market.  Further, price action analysis underscores the need for traders to be cautious – a failure to hold above 50-day moving average for the third time could turn the tables in favor of the bears.  Daily chart - History is not repeating itself  On the charts, bulls are struggling to mimic a successful pattern in July (when a rebound from the 100-day moving average in the wake of an oversold relative strength index was followed by a rally to record high).  Back in July, the rebound from 100-day moving average was followed by a convincing break above the 50-day moving average.  This time, however, it's a different story. Rather, bulls are having a tough time keeping the cryptocurrency above the 50-day moving average. BTC has already failed twice (on September 16 and September 19) to build upon a break above the indicator.  Prices rose above 50-day moving average yesterday, but faced rejection at $4,269 and fell back to $4,140 (the 50-day moving average). A failure to hold above the key moving average for the third time would be bad news for bitcoin.  Bearish scenario  A failure to hold above 50-day moving average followed by a break below the rising trend line support (seen sloping higher to $3,930) would signal the cryptocurrency has topped out. Prices could then drop to $3,382 (100-day moving average levels).  Bullish scenario  Sideways to positive action above the 50-day moving average over the next 48 hours or so would improve the odds of a rally to $4,500-$4,665 (September 7 high).

In an interview with Bloomberg Markets, Michael Oved detailed his plans for AirSwap, one of a growing number of projects that seek to use the ethereum blockchain as a means to connect buyers and sellers directly. Oved says he hopes to draw in institutional investors, who would, through AirSwap, trade tokens through the use of smart contracts.  ""There is no central exchange hub or clearinghouse, the transactions are negotiated peer-to-peer and then the swap is executed and cleared on the ethereum blockchain,"" he told the publication in an interview.  The idea  of using blockchain as a peer-to-peer trading infrastructure has gained traction in recent months, showcased in part by the $24 million initial coin offering (ICO) for 0x. Proponents say that decentralized exchanges avoid some of the pitfalls for more centralized options, including the risk of fraud and cyberattack.  In the interview, Oved pointed to those perceived benefits, including the resiliency created through direct trades between two parties.  ""It's impossible to shut down, and you don't even need an account,"" Oved told Bloomberg. ""People won't even know Chinese traders are on the system.""  Founded in 2008, Virtu gained notoriety for the success of its high-speed trading operations. It was reported in April that Virtu would buy HFT rival KCG Holdings in a deal valued at $1.4 billion.

According to a Form S-1 dated September 27, ProShares Capital Management wants to create two bitcoin-tied funds: the ProShares Bitcoin ETF and the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF. Like other proposed ETFs that have emerged in recent months, ProShares isn’t planning to buy direct stakes in the cryptocurrency; rather, it intends to create exposure through derivatives contracts.  Per the filing, ProShares is aiming for a maximum aggregate offering price of $1 million, priced at $25 per share, with a plan to have it listed on the NYSE Arca exchange.

Martin Wildberger, RBC's executive vice president, told Reuters that what he called the ""shadow ledger"" allows the bank to monitor payments in real time as they pass between U.S. and Canadian banks, with the further benefits of simplifying transactions and lowering costs.  The trial, which was developed over the past six months at the RBC blockchain development lab in Toronto, allows the bank to explore the potential of the tech without fully replacing the existing system.  Wildberger told the news source:  ""We wanted to set it up as a shadow ledger so that we can demonstrate our leadership in exploiting that technology while at the same time recognizing that the technology is still early in its adoption phase.""  The use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology can greatly simplify and increase the functionality of banking systems, he continued. Calling blockchain ""transformative and critical,"" the bank executive emphasized that he believes the technology still needs time to mature, however.  RBC is also exploring blockchain in other capacities. Wildberger confirmed to Reuters that the bank was experimenting with use cases such as consumer rewards and loyalty offerings. Linda Mantia, RBC's EVP of digital, payments and cards, told CoinDesk last year that it was also researching the potential of smart contracts, and the use of blockchain for capital markets.  Back in May, the Bank of Canada, Canada’s central bank, told local newspaper the Globe and Mail that there are ""many hurdles"" in the way of blockchain adoption for banks, although there is potential for blockchain to underpin an entire payment system ""one day.""

According to a document on the regulator's website, the legal treatment of cryptographic tokens issued in ICOs will vary in nature depending on their structure. While some token sales will be classified under general Australian consumer law, ICOs offering financial products will be regulated under the country's Corporations Act.  In the latter case, the law will carry some protections for investors, but if an ICO fails to meet the required definitions, that may not be the case.  ASIC states:  ""In some cases, ICO issuers may frame the entitlements received by contributors as a receipt of a purchased service. However, if the value of the digital coins acquired is affected by the pooling of funds from contributors or use of those funds under the arrangement, then the ICO is likely to fall within the requirements relating to MISs [managed investment schemes]. This is often the case if what is offered through the ICO has the attributes of an investment.""  If an ICO is considered an MIS, there are a ""range of disclosure, registration and licensing obligations under the Corporations Act,"" the document says.  Further, in the case of an ICO offering a financial product, the ICO operator may also require a market licence in order to sell tokens.  With misinformation in investment prospectuses prohibited by law, the ASIC statement also warns that ICO white papers are legally required not to issue misleading or deceptive statements..  ASIC commissioner John Price told the Sydney Morning Herald that, if the tokens are not financial products, ""investors will need to closely consider the ICO documentation as the investor protection regime under the Corporations Act will not apply.""  The regulator's statement comes soon after China issued an all-out ban on ICO schemes, stating that they are ""illegal and disruptive to economic and financial stability."" ASIC is comparatively sympathetic to the technology, however, believing it can widen the fundraising options available to businesses.  The document states:  ""ASIC recognises that ICOs have the potential to make an important contribution to the options available to businesses to raise funds and to investment options available to investors. An ICO must be conducted in a manner that promotes investor trust and confidence, and complies with the relevant laws.""  Various international authorities – including Russia, the U.K. and Singapore – have issued statements on token sales in recent months, warning that investors may not be liable for protection.  Approximately $797 million was raised by ICOs in the second quarter of this year, according to CoinDesk's latest State of Blockchain report. According to the CoinDesk ICO tracker, this month alone has raised a total of $517 million in cumulative funding.

At press time, the zcash-US dollar (ZEC/USD) exchange rate had reached a high of $410, its highest level since June, only to fall back to $290 levels, the volatile day driven by reports the coin could be listed on South Korea's exchanges. Indeed, the inciting news here appears to be news about the forthcoming addition of the cryptocurrency to Bithumb, one of the country's largest trading platforms.  Stepping back, the move can be seen as part of a larger trend wherein South Korea is proving to be the basis for strong upswings in cryptocurrency valuations, though zcash's increase might mark the largest to date.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at $310, up 12.8% in the last 24 hours. Factoring for the swing, ZEC is up 10% month-on-month and 75% week-on-week.  So is the rally in ZEC a flash in the pan or something that could be sustained over the longer period? Price action analysis says the cryptocurrency could remain on the front foot in coming days.  Daily chart  The chart above shows a descending triangle breakout, which is defined by a horizontal bottom and downsloping top.  The upside break marks the continuation of the rally from the February 20 low of $222. Further, the sharp rise in the volume indicates the rally has substance.  Despite the retreat from the high of $410, the outlook remains bullish – a trend change is likely if prices fall below the support offered by the downward sloping trend line.  View  The 14-day RSI is overbought, which indicates the rally is overstretched. Short-term consolidation in the range of $290-350 is likely before the cryptocurrency has another go at $400 levels.

""With artificial intelligence and blockchain, the [White House] is exploring a whole range of forward-leaning capabilities that might be helpful to government,"" Margie Graves, acting federal chief information officer at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), said at the event.  The remarks are notable given that the OMB, which is headed by Congressional Blockchain Caucus co-founder Mick Mulvaney, is responsible for carrying out the president's vision for the executive branch of government – a core tenet of which is streamlining bureaucracy and improving responsiveness to citizens through technology.  In remarks, Graves – who said that she will be meeting with blockchain advocate Don Tapscott next month to discuss use cases the government might explore – stressed that she and Mulvaney view distributed ledger technology as a potentially powerful tool.  Specifically, Graves sees the possibility for its use in reducing instances of fraud and waste, cutting spending and beefing up cybersecurity defenses.  She continued:  ""These kinds of technologies are always something that we should explore. I don't want my customers to be the last to know, or to be the last to be able to take advantage of some of these.""  Laying the foundation  Chris Liddell, assistant to the president and director of strategic initiatives at the White House, also stressed that the government must approach data management with an eye for the long term.  Perhaps most important, he said, is implementing foundational data standards now, so that the U.S. can be in position to harness the potential of blockchain and other technologies moving ahead.  ""As we look to the future, we want to ensure that today's reforms do not hinder tomorrow's adoption of emerging technologies,"" he said, adding:  ""Whether it is blockchain, artificial intelligence or perhaps a new technology that hasn't yet been envisaged, standardized data will help ensure the government stays current of technology's latest trends.""  Liddell also serves in the White House Office of American Innovation (OAI), which was created by President Trump in March with a mandate to develop recommendations on how technology can be used to improve government operations.  The OIA is headed by Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, and includes Gary Cohn – the president's top economic advisor – and other leaders from government and the private sector. Liddell had previously served as chief financial officer at Microsoft and has held senior executive roles at other large public companies such as International Paper and General Motors.  Building momentum  Taken as a whole, the comments are the latest in a wave of bullish comments from U.S. officials on the potential for blockchain's use both inside and outside of government.  As reported by CoinDesk, several U.S. government agencies – including the Centers for Disease Control and the General Services Administration – are experimenting with blockchain pilot projects.  However, this is not the first time a Trump administration official has taken a bullish stance on blockchain.  In March, Mark Calabria, chief economist to Vice President Mike Pence, told a conference in Washington that there was a great enthusiasm within the Trump White House toward blockchain, hinting that progress toward adoption could be seen in the coming years.

42400479,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJgj7,1506596407,Crypto Hedge Fund Costs? Invest $100k and Here's How Much You'd Pay,"Nobody works for free – least of all hedge fund managers.  So, despite their investments in bitcoin, ether and other emerging digital assets, there are certainly no major leaps in how cryptocurrency hedge funds appear to be calculating their costs.  All crypto hedge fund managers get paid in the fees they charge to investors – and, just like in traditional markets, those fees aren't always easy to understand. Calculating the costs and possible return on your investment can prove challenging, given that fee structures are often described in ways that marry the worst aspects of legalese with the wonky accounting of tax documentation.  To shine a light on how these costs work, CoinDesk obtained a copy of a fee structure for a cryptocurrency fund. The following example is loosely based on a product now actively available in the market, but greatly simplified to make its terms and conditions easier to parse.  CoinDesk assumed a $100,000 investment in a fund with a vanilla ""two and 20"" fee structure that earns a 10 percent gross return.  While the example below is just that – one example – it can still be a helpful metric to aid you in your evaluations. After all, while a cryptocurrency hedge fund may be appealing – it should also be compared to the pros and cons of your own active management.  The first point to understand when looking at a fund is the management fee, which is what you pay upfront as soon as you invest in the fund.  The typical management fee is 2 percent on every dollar you invest. As an example, let's say you've found a fund with a solid strategy, and it has a minimum investment of $100,000. This means that on your $100,000 investment, you would get charged $2,000, meaning you're only ""putting to work"" $98,000 in the investment.  Right off the bat, that's money that won't be going directly into the market, and in cryptocurrency, where there have been historical benefits to holding, that might be something to consider.  Still, that might not necessarily be a deterrent. Let's say at the end of the year, the fund generates a 10 percent return, as in this example, you could end up with a potentially attractive profit.  Depending on what you were expecting, you may be thrilled or you may be disappointed – but, either way, you're probably not done paying fees yet.  Incentive fees: $1,960  In the most basic analyses, there are two kinds of fees that hedge funds charge their investors: management fees, like the 2 percent discussed earlier, and ""incentive fees"" that are applied to profits.  In a typical, vanilla fund scenario, investors pay around 20 percent fees on their returns. These fees are usually called incentive fees because they seek to align investor returns with the compensation of the fund managers.  The percentages charged on incentive fees are typically far higher than management fees, which makes sense, because the fund's managers or general partners are being rewarded for their product's performance. So, the greater the return that fund managers make for their investors the greater the fees they earn for themselves.  Let's continue to assume that the fund you invested in generated a 10 percent gross return. Since you earned 10 percent profit on your investment after management fees, the gross return, before the incentive fees were charged, would be $9,800.  A 20 percent fee charged against your gross return means another $1,960 in fees get assessed.  Total cost: $3,960 and return  So, adding it all up, you would pay a total of $3,960 in fees on your investment in the fund.  Let's take a look at the investment from a different angle — the rate of return you received on your investment.  After the management fee and incentive fees get charged, investors would receive a $7,840 net return on their investment, or a 7.84 percent rate of return for the year.  Whether or not that fits the bill with your expectations, is up to you as the investor. As mentioned above, given the extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency markets, there can be upside or downside in putting your money to work directly on available exchanges.  Still, if you're looking for exposure to a very volatile market, and you're not interested in doing the legwork required to actively manage your own portfolio, the above example should give you a better sense of the potential costs – and possible returns.  $100 bills image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Ash Bennington,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/09/28/crypto-hedge-fund-costs-invest-100k-and-heres-how-much-youd-pay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9244082f45716180b564df02aa73779faa450b5c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15989262,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/malaysia-legalises-bitcoin-big-deal,1506595789,Malaysia Legalises Bitcoin – Why This Is A Big Deal,"After the news that China has clamped down on Cryptocurrency, and banned all exchanges, which saw a slight decline for Bitcoin, good news is well and truly needed. This comes in the form that Malaysia has recently legalised Bitcoin, which is great news for cryptocurrencies, and could bring in millions of new users. It has been reported that Malaysia’s central bank is working to develop a framework that would regulate the use of different cryptocurrencies. The Governor Muhammad bin Ibrahim has released a statement saying that by the end of the year, they hope to have issued guidelines on cryptocurrencies, particularly around the cryptocurrencies that are related to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. Despite stating just three years ago, that Bitcoin would not be recognised as legal tender, this big U-turn has been marked as an important event for both Malaysia, and Bitcoin; not to mention other cryptocurrencies. We will take a look at why this is not just a good thing for Malaysia, but for Bitcoin as a whole, and why it could attract millions of more users, increasing the overall demand for Bitcoin. What this means for Malaysia? What has caused this huge turnaround for Malaysia, and why are they now fully supporting cryptocurrencies? The recent development could bring some big changes to Malaysia and surrounding areas, with most notably the large number of expat workers, who send a lot of their money out of the country, and to their respective home countries. In recent months, they have been hit by monetary devaluation and strict capital controls, which has had a detrimental effect on their money. Malaysia has always had strict rules and regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies, which is why this U-turn seems surprising to some. Despite the fact that they have long remained tight lipped when it comes to cryptocurrencies, the country’s central bank; Bank Negara is considerable openminded – something that is actually very refreshing to see these days. Many financial institutions frown upon cryptocurrencies because they feel that as a country, they will never be able to properly regulate it. Just two weeks ago, the Malaysian Securities Commission issued a strong warning not to invest in cryptocurrencies; however, this is nothing new, like we previously stated above. Right now, Malaysia is working to come up with a framework that will allow traders to trade in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but one that also address money laundering and terrorist financing. The country is known for its growth, and many other economic accomplishments, and inevitably wants to apply a similar strength to cryptocurrency, which will not be easy, which is why they are working hard to come up with an effective framework. This is a very exciting move for Malaysia though, and many experts are predicting that the nation may become one of the next major cryptocurrency hubs in the coming years, and one to keep a definite eye on. Why this is a good thing… The news that Malaysia is legalising Bitcoin is ultimately a great thing, as it could bring millions of new users. We previously mentioned that the Malaysian government was hit hard with the devaluation of the Malaysian ringgit, which caused the country’s national currency to decline by around 2 percent in value against some of the biggest currencies, such as the US dollar. By the country legalising Bitcoin, it could provide an alternative financial and remittance system to the expat workers who were struggling to send their money to their native countries. This could give them a way in which to move money in and out of the country effectively. Despite this legalisation process still being in the very early stages, some leading Bitcoin remittance service providers and brokerages have already secured millions of dollars in funding, and have expanded their operations to Malaysia. Of course, this theory will only work in countries where Bitcoin is very much established and well-regulated, which could prove problematic now for those wishing to send their currency to China, who have recently placed a ban on all cryptocurrencies. However, the Malaysian central bank is still quick to point out that, despite this legalisation, they are not endorsing any cryptocurrency, as a currency as it is not issued by a central bank, and not backed by any commodity. However, what they do plan on doing is to regulate this, when it is used for the delivery of financial services. Regardless of how it is looked at, for those in the cryptocurrency bubble, this is only a good thing, and a much welcome piece of news after China’s demise.

42400461,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJgSO,1506585640,ICO First: Farm Collective Wins Clearinghouse Approval for Token Sale,"The first initial coin offering (ICO) to be sanctioned by a traditional clearing and settlement platform is now underway in Russia.  Just days after signing an agreement with NP RTS Group, the LavkaLavka farming collective has discreetly begun taking orders for a pre-sale of its ""biocoin"" tokens. So far, the organization has raised $500,000 toward a $15 million goal. But if successful, the ICO would fund the creation of an expansive loyalty platform, one that would link together 200 farms, restaurants, cafes and small businesses that today have had difficulty getting capital from traditional banks.  Stepping back, the stamp of approval from a legacy institution represents yet another step toward legitimization for the ICO funding model, which has powered more than $2 billion in project funding worldwide, despite stoking fears about fraud and money laundering.  But what truly sets apart the ICO is how it fits into a plan initiated by Russian President Vladimir Putin to attract foreign investment to one of Russia's least developed regions.  In his first interview, LavkaLavka founder and farmer Boris Akimov explained why he went out of his way to work with Russia's existing system to implement what might be considered by some to be a disruptive platform.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Usually people take the money from Russia and go to other countries with this money. This will be an example of how Russia can use modern financial instruments and technological instruments, to help money come to the country, and not go outside.""  When the ICO becomes broadly available on November 1, the tokens are expected to be issued on NP RTS's Voskhod platform, created last year in response to the establishment of Putin's Far East Development Fund to encourage investment in the region.  And it's this fund, which has set up policies including favorable taxes and the permission to experiment with ICOs as a way to attract investment, that is helping make the sale possible.  ""The state gave this region special rights to do things which [are] not allowed for other regions,"" said Akimov. ""This investment system, Voskhod, which is inside the RTS, also got special rights to start to work with blockchain and cryptocurrencies.""  Echoing his sentiment was the director of innovation at Russia's central securities depository, Artem Duvanov, who has also been using blockchain to attract foreign investment in Russia.  ""It's being done in a completely legal way,"" Duvanov told CoinDesk. ""The buyers of LavkaLavka tokens will be granted with ordinary private equity shares in proportion to what they will have bought during the ICO.""  Crypto-agrarianism  Built from a fork of the peercoin blockchain, biocoin was seeded with 20 million tokens earlier this year as part of an ""operational test mode"" to gather data on how customers and merchants would use the currency.  Following that initial test phase, the first tranche of what will eventually be 1 billion tokens went up for sale on Monday, quickly generating the $500,000 in bitcoin, ether, the Russian cryptocurrency SIB and Visa and Mastercard payments.  Under the partnership with RTS, LavkaLavka immediately converts the funds to rubles and only handles fiat currency. Half the $15 million Akimov hopes to raise would be set aside for expanding the collective's network of farms and businesses dependent on locally produced goods.  But the other half has been earmarked for further development of biocoin. After the ICO completes, additional biocoin tokens will be issued to people who shop with members of the collective. Eventually, LavkaLavka wants to build out a system for tracking the supply chain of locally grown, indigenous food.  In order to cash-out their tokens, biocoin holders will need to undergo a short onboarding process at RTS to verify their identity. The Voskhod platform would in effect double as a stock exchange and a cryptocurrency exchange for the securitized tokens. Alternatively, users could spend biocoin on goods at affiliated locations.  ""Blockchain gives the chance to the people to build their own community and to be on their own, to be more independent from modern financial institutions,"" said Akimov.  ""We want biocoin to be an example of a financial institution which will support small, green businesses.""  The Putin factor  Notably, this is not the first time Akimov has benefited from the policies of President Putin.  In August 2014, Putin enacted food sanctions against the European Union, the U.S. and others that forced Russia to find new ways to feed itself. As a result, Akimov started to receive an increased number of calls from vendors around the country looking to capitalize on his nascent farming collective, according to a New York Times report.  Since then, LavkaLavka has doubled in size, from 100 farms to 200. In total, Akimov estimates the firm now employs 250 people, not counting the 2,000 farmers he estimates are employed by affiliate members.  In short, more ICOs of this sort may be expected. There are currently 14 other companies being vetted for admittance to the Voskhod platform, according to Vitaly Kaslivtsev, a project manager at NP RTS Group.  ""The parties intend to conduct joint analyses and select potential projects, attracting potential investors for the purchase of tokens through the initial placement procedure using the exchange platform,"" he said.  In a statement following the signing of the agreement, the general director of Putin's Far Eastern Development Fund, Alexey Chekunkov, described the context of the partnership:  ""We are witnessing an unprecedented phenomenon in the history of finance — a real democratization of capitalism, when millions of investors from all over the world are directly investing in promising projects using blocking technology.""
