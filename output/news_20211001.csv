The company, a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group, said in a statement its $494 million Digital Large Cap Fund closed Friday with a 3.24% SOL position.  It “is the first time Solana (SOL) will be included in a Grayscale investment vehicle,” the statement said. It called the move part of a quarterly rebalancing.  SOL is now the fourth-largest holding of a fund dominated by bitcoin. SOL gave back some gains late Friday but remained near session highs – a tick south of $160.  The fund also added decentralized exchange Uniswap’s native token UNI. The token will make up around 1% of the overall fund.

But it no secret that Ethereum has been quickly catching up with the pioneer cryptocurrency. Ethereum&apos;s decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases have been the major contributor behind this space as investors have flocked to the blockchain to earning returns on their crypto holdings. This has given rise to popular Layer 2 solutions like Polygon. Recently, co-founder and COO of Polygon Sandeep Nailwal was on Cointelegraph to talk about the future of the leading smart contracts blockchain. Ethereum is the number 2 layer 1 blockchain, only behind bitcoin. And Nailwal believes that it is only a matter of time before the blockchain takes over as the leading Layer 1 protocol.

42376080,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEDN1,1633123555,Bitcoin Climbs Above $47K as Stocks Fall and Investors Eye Inflation,"Bitcoin is pushing higher despite classic risk-off action in traditional markets. The cryptocurrency’s resilience has raised investors’ hopes for a stellar rally in October.  As of 11:16 UTC, the cryptocurrency was trading 8% higher on the day near $47,400. The broader crypto market is also positive, with native cryptocurrencies of smart-contract blockchains like VeChain, Tezos and Elrond gaining more than 8%. Ethereum’s ether currency traded 7% higher at $3,245.  S&P 500 E-mini futures, meantime, are nursing a loss, indicating a lower opening for the benchmark stock index. The dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major fiat currencies, is trading just short of the 12-month high of 94.50 reached Thursday.  Reduced probability of a regulatory clampdown on crypto markets seems to be cushioning bitcoin from the instability of traditional markets. On Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress the central bank has “no intention” of banning cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins. Powell’s comments came a day after U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler reiterated support for bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETF).  The sentiment in the crypto community appears quite bullish, with several analysts and traders referring to October as “Uptober” on Twitter – a newly coined slang, representing expectations for a price rally this month.  After all, October is a seasonally bullish period, and bitcoin’s recent stability amid stock market losses and China’s blanket ban on virtual currency businesses is reminiscent of the cryptocurrency’s resilience in the face of the negative news seen just before the beginning of the bull run from $10,000 in September and October 2020.  A year ago, bitcoin remained locked in the range of $10,000 to $11,000 throughout September and early October despite a notable pullback in the S&P 500. The cryptocurrency absorbed multiple negative news like exchange hacks and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s charges against the then major crypto exchange BitMEX. What followed was a stellar six-month bull run to $64,800.  It remains to be seen if history will repeat itself. While rising inflation expectations across the globe and falling real or inflation-adjusted bond yields are supportive of a renewed bull run, the Fed’s impending taper – or scaling back – of stimulus may slow down the ascent.  Last month, the U.S. central bank signaled that the taper would begin in the final quarter and might end by mid-2022, assuming there are no new economic shocks.  Fears of a faster Fed taper may grip markets, bringing pain for asset prices, in general, if the U.S. core personal consumption expenditure data due at 12:30 UTC today blows past expectations.  According to CNBC, the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation could show moderation in August after rising 3.6% year on year in both June and July. Analysts at TD Securities foresee an unchanged reading.  “The core PCE price index appears to have risen more than the core CPI in August (an estimated 0.26% versus 0.10%), boosted by data from the PPI. The YoY change likely remained high at 3.6%,” TD Securities’ analysts said, according to FXStreet.  Data released early today showed eurozone inflation rose 3.4% on an annual basis in September, hitting the highest reading since September 2008.

Between March and May 20, the hacker or hackers used a flaw in Coinbase’s account recovery process to get the SMS two-factor authentication token to break into customers’ accounts and transfer funds out of them.  The bad actor or actors also had access to the email address, password and phone number associated with each Coinbase account. Coinbase believes that the hacker stole those credentials through a phishing scheme and noted in its letter to the California AG that it has not found evidence of the hacker getting this information from Coinbase itself.  “We took immediate action to mitigate the impact of the campaign by working with external partners to remove phishing sites as they were identified, as well as notifying the email providers impacted,” a Coinbase spokesperson said via email. “Unfortunately we believe, although cannot conclusively determine, that some Coinbase customers may have fallen victim to the phishing campaign and turned over their Coinbase credentials and the phone numbers verified in their accounts to attackers.”  Coinbase said it is compensating customers for the stolen funds, but it’s unclear whether those payments are being made in fiat or crypto.  The exchange recommended that users switch to a more secure version of multi-factor authentication such as a hardware security key or authentication app.  This appears to be one of the largest breaches to have affected Coinbase. Other notable breaches included a password glitch in August 2019 that stored 3,500 customer passwords in plain text on an internal server log, although outside parties didn’t take advantage of the vulnerability.

42376076,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEDHz,1633123109,Compound Founder Says $80M Bug Presents ‘Moral Dilemma’ for DeFi Users,"If a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol accidentally gave you millions of dollars in tokens, are you obligated to give it back?  In an interview with CoinDesk following an $80 million exploit, Compound Labs founder Robert Leshner is arguing users should do just that.  On Wednesday night, a bug in money market Compound’s code led to an erroneous disbursement of COMP tokens intended for long-term liquidity mining rewards.  Read more: DeFi Money Market Compound Overpays Millions in COMP Rewards in Possible Exploit; Founder Says $80M at Risk  The Compound Twitter handle acknowledged the bug shortly after, saying that no user funds were at risk. The bug only applied to Compound’s Comptroller Contract, which is responsible for distributing liquidity mining rewards earned over time.  Nearly the entirety of the Comptroller Contract has now been drained, with 280,000 COMP distributed to users incorrectly, according to Leshner.  Despite the eye-popping sums lost to the bug, however, the community is now captivated by a debate as to what users should be obligated to do with their funds.  “This has been, without a doubt, the worst day in the history of the Compound protocol,” Leshner told CoinDesk.  He went on:  “What makes it way worse is that I and most folks are completely powerless to do anything besides sit back and watch this moral dilemma play out.”  IRS threats  In a Tweet on Thursday night, Leshner seemed to warn recipients of the erroneous tokens that there could be real-world consequences for keeping them – namely, that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) might want to hear about it:  Some members of the DeFi community interpreted the comments to mean that Compound Labs was planning to report recipients to relevant tax authorities. Leshner apologized for the tweet shortly after.  Threats of “doxxing” have proven to be effective in dealing with exploits in the past – last month, a non-fungible token (NFT) team memorably threatened to call in the FBI and ordered soup to a hacker’s address. The hacker relented, returning stolen funds.  However, in this instance even if an organization wished to pursue claimants, in practicality it may be an empty threat.  Compound Labs is a real-world entity that is working on the protocol, but there’s no clear basis for it to pursue legal action – the structure of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is such that it is now just another member of the community, according to a Compound Labs representative.  The representative also said the Compound interface is hosted on distributed file storage protocol InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and there’s no reportable information about users collected in any way.  However, due to the nature of the bug, many of the recipients of the tokens are not sophisticated hackers – they just happened to hit the jackpot.  Their operational security, or opsec, isn’t hacker-grade. Some addresses that claimed large sums of the tokens have interacted with centralized exchanges where their real-world information is stored, and the claims could have an impact on their taxes.  Claiming the funds required no knowledge of the bug, and some users might not have been aware there was an exploit underway – they may have received millions while intending to harvest much smaller sums as rewards.  Leshner said the DeFi community has rallied around the protocol in an effort to find solutions. Yearn.Finance and MakerDAO representatives have been active in community channels in finding short- and long-term solutions.  However, Compound has an “extremely rigid” and slow governance process by design – architecture intended to make the protocol more resilient is now acting as a barrier to a fix. It will take another five days before the community can approve any updates to the contract code.  Technical solutions to the initial bug aside, however, the protocol now faces an even bigger problem: trying to convince users who received tokens to return them to the community.  “In my opinion, this is a bank error in a couple people’s favor,” said Leshner.  He went on:  “I think it’s harder because there was nothing deliberately criminal. If there was a hacker who deliberately exploited the code, people would celebrate going after them with every means possible. These users weren’t initially malicious.”  Moral dilemma  The question now turns to whether a moral obligation, rather than a legal one, can incite users to return funds – a question that has prompted significant debate in the crypto community.  One popular take is that “code is law” – regardless of intention, the protocol disbursed the funds and now users can spend them as they please.  However, others are appealing to the notion of “public goods” – that taking ill-gotten money from an on-chain bank, where anyone in the world can take out a loan regardless of who they are, is a violation of DeFi’s highest ideals.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Leshner said the moral dilemma can be split roughly into two camps.  “There’s a lot of members of the community that view protocols like Compound as benefitting the entire ecosystem,” he said. “And there are some users that don’t necessarily care. The builder mindset is, ‘This adds value, this is crucially important,’ and the trader mindset is ‘Money is money,’ and that’s the only ethos of crypto.”  He went on:  “I’m personally hopeful users will return funds to the community. It’s not my property, it’s not their property, it’s the community’s property.”  So far, two users have returned a total of 37,493 COMP tokens worth over $12 million at the time of writing.  “There are ideas to further incentivize people to return the COMP that they received,” Leshner said, but even with some incentive program “it’s still going to be relying on people doing the right thing.”  Read more: ‘Free Money’ Bug Hits DeFi Platform Alchemix  Some potential incentives have already been proposed, including non-fungible tokens (NFT) redeemable for a meeting with Leshner, to which he enthusiastically agreed:  “I want to hear other people’s views on this, because it’s not my decision,” he said. “This is a decision every user has to make themselves, and I think most of them are taking the view of, ‘Haha, f**k you guys, it’s your problem.’”",NEGATIVE,COMP,BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/01/compound-founder-says-80m-bug-presents-moral-dilemma-for-defi-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0992d13596c5e1810f9032399d46d2643245efef-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376084,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEDPX,1633123010,Market Wrap: Cryptocurrencies Rally as Short Sellers Exit Positions,"Cryptocurrencies rallied on Friday as bitcoin broke above $47,000 for the first time in two weeks. BTC is up about 10% over the past 24 hours, compared with an 8% rise in ether. Global equities are also stabilizing after a volatile week.  “The move higher [in bitcoin] resulted in over 35 million short futures positions being liquidated across major exchanges,” FundStrat wrote in a newsletter on Friday.  “However, technically speaking, BTC is still trading in the range and has to decisively break the $50K resistance if we are to see higher prices,” Ulrik K. Lykke, founder of digital asset hedge fund ARK36, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “It is not yet certain whether today’s price really will prove indicative of a greater uptrend.”  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $47,902, +9.5%  Ether (ETH), $3,299, +9.4%  S&P 500: +1.2%  Gold: $1,758, +0.0%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.467%  Crypto momentum improves  Some analysts characterize the recent upside move in cryptocurrencies as an oversold bounce. Technically, that occurs when prices become stretched to the downside, which encourages short sellers to exit their positions.  The chart below shows MRB Partners’ cyclical momentum index, which is an equally weighted aggregate measure of the speed of price changes across a select group of cryptocurrencies. The index shows cryptocurrencies became the most oversold since early last year.  Still, several risks remain that could limit further upside.  “The challenge for this speculative space is there remain too many macro headwinds to be resolved,” Santiago Espinosa, a strategist at MRB Partners, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Espinosa said the global regulatory crackdown is still evolving. Outside of China, U.S. and European authorities may enact stricter measures that could handicap crypto prices by making it harder for users to exchange crypto for fiat currencies, according to Espinosa.  Ether holds support  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, returned to above $3,000, and is up about 9% over the past week. Similar to bitcoin’s rise, ether’s uptrend is stabilizing as buyers gained momentum over the past few days. The next level of resistance for ETH is seen at around the $3,500-$4,000 range, which could limit upside over the short term.  ETH lost some ground relative to BTC over the past month during the broader crypto sell-off. However, the ETH/BTC ratio is holding support above 0.66, which could stabilize the relative pullback.  DeFi option strategies  The crypto “cash-and-carry” trade – where traders simultaneously enter into a long position on bitcoin or ether in the spot market and then a short position in the futures market, a way of betting on the eventual convergence of the two prices – has lost its shine, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported.  Reliable for 30% annualized gains earlier this year, the opportunity has since shrunk to single digits, as the frenzied bullishness witnessed in cryptocurrency markets earlier this year faded and as major exchanges reined in leverage.  But investors can still make double-digit returns via weekly ether or bitcoin “covered call” strategies offered by decentralized finance (DeFi) asset management platforms, including Ribbon Finance and StakeDAO. To do that, investors have to deposit coins in “strategy vaults” designed to automate the trade.  Altcoin roundup  NFT gaming giant Axie Infinity’s revenue drops 40% in September: Revenue in September for blockchain-enabled, play-to-earn game Axie Infinity slid by 40% from August, the first month-over-month decline since January, Godbole reported. Axie made 64,933.71 ether (ETH), worth $220.32 million, in September, down from a record $342 million in August, data center Axie World shows. While September’s figure represents a nearly 3,000-fold year-over-year growth, it’s only about 10% of the pace of the month before. The AXS token was trading near $78 early Friday morning, up over 14,000% on a year-to-date basis, according to TradingView data. Prices reached a high of $95 in early September before retreating with the broader crypto market following China’s blanket ban on virtual currency businesses.  Compound’s founder urges recipients of faulty $90 million token reward to return funds: The DeFi lending protocol paid out millions of dollars in COMP tokens because of a coding bug, prompting founder Robert Leshner to solicit a return of funds via Twitter. “If you received a large, incorrect amount of COMP from the Compound protocol error: Please return it,” Leshner tweeted Thursday evening. “Keep 10% as a white-hat. Otherwise, it’s being reported as income to the IRS (Internal Revenue Service), and most of you are doxed.” After his tweet was met with backlash for its threatening overtones, Leshner responded: “I’m trying to do anything I can to help the community get some of its COMP back, and this was a bone-headed tweet / approach. That’s on me.”  Fitch Ratings publishes stablecoin report highlighting USDC portfolio allocation shift: The ratings agency published its Stablecoin Dashboard 1H21 report, aggregating information on the security portfolios of the largest stablecoins. According to Fitch, stablecoin portfolio allocations shifted during the past several months. “USDCoin held 10% CP and 15% in certificates of deposits (CDs) as of end-June 2021,” the report said. “However, USDCoin’s portfolio significantly de-risked between June and August 2021, with cash and cash equivalents approximately doubling to 92% of portfolio assets.” Fitch also said stablecoins would become “increasingly relevant constituencies in the short-term credit markets.”  Relevant News  El Salvador Mines First Bitcoin With Volcanic Energy  SEC Delays Decision on 4 Bitcoin ETFs  Fitch: Debt Limit Fight Could Endanger US’s ‘AAA’ Rating  Rep.

Called “TikTok Top Moments,” the collection is the social media app’s first whole-hog foray into the world of blockchain-based digital collectibles.  The idea is to pair TikTok creators with artists in the crypto space: Each creator will auction a one-of-one NFT celebrating one of their viral videos, and sell a set of collaborative editions at a fixed price.  The NFTs also represent a partnership with Immutable, a layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum. It’s designed to make transactions a little more user-friendly, promising “zero” transaction fees and “100% carbon-neutral NFTs.” (Though, because Immutable is engaged with Ethereum, it’s still incentivizing activity on an energy-intensive proof-of-work blockchain.)  Other creators involved with TikTok’s NFTs include Brittany Broski (also known as “Kombucha Girl”), Curtis Roach and Coin Artist, who comes from the crypto side of things.

42376078,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEDJF,1633115994,Société Générale Applies for $20M MakerDAO Loan Using Bond Token Collateral,"In a proposal on Thursday on MakerDAO’s governance forums, French multinational banking giant Société Générale (SocGen) submitted an application for the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform to accept on-chain bond tokens issued by the bank as collateral for a stablecoin DAI loan.  The loan, mediated between a number of legal entities and third parties in a somewhat complex legal architecture, would be for up to $20 million in DAI – likely the largest step towards institutional adoption of DeFi to date.  The application was submitted by Société Générale – Forge, a “regulated subsidiary” of the bank with a focus on digital assets. SocGen has been a leader in experimenting with blockchain assets for years, having issued bond-backed tokens on the Ethereum blockchain as far back as 2019.  Read more: Why French Lender SocGen Issued a $110 Million Ethereum Bond to Itself  The tokens that SocGen has submitted for application as collateral were issued in 2020, have a fixed rate of 0%, and mature in 2025. They sport a AAA rating from rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch. Both the bond tokens and DAI are recognized under French law.  SocGen wrote in the proposal that the loan would be a “pilot use case,” and that one of the goals of the project is to “help to shape and promote an experiment under the French legal framework.”  Legal headaches  Given both teams’ smart contractual expertise, the real barrier to the application appears to be organizing the legal framework that will avoid the often-messy conflicts that can arise when real-world organizations attempt to interact with on-chain, self-governing systems.  A flowchart included in the proposal shows six entities: SocGen; SocGen Forge; the MakerDAO protocol; the DIIS Group that will serve as a “security agent,” a requirement under French law to enforce the terms of the loan on the real-world side on Maker’s behalf; an as-yet unappointed MakerDAO legal representative; and an as-yet-unnamed third party that will facilitate exchanging the DAI loan to dollars, likely either a custodian service or a centralized exchange.  In an interview with CoinDesk, pseudonymous MakerDAO contributor “PaperImperium” implied that Maker has a number of options when it comes to choosing its legal representation.  “The Maker Representative will probably be one of the legal entities we have been experimenting with. I’m not sure if we have settled on which one, but we have several options of structure and jurisdiction,” he wrote on Twitter.  In April, Maker made headlines by issuing a $38,000 loan to finance a real-world mortgage and has been exploring other real-world options in collaboration with Tinlake and Centrifuge.  Read more: MakerDAO on Collision Course With Banking Regulators  “This is the next logical step in MakerDAO’s mission to integrate the crypto and real-world economies. Our first experiments with home loans in April were akin to Sputnik, and the SocGen-Forge proposal is akin to Yuri Gagarin,” PaperImperium said of the application, referring to the Russian astronaut who was the first man in space.  He went on:  “From here, the next goal is the moon.”  Business development  PaperImperium said members of the DAO’s Growth core unit initially brought the deal together and that the Real World Finance core unit will “spearhead the preparations and operations of the bond repo.” “Core units” are the decentralized entities with budgets provided by MakerDAO to operate the protocol following the dissolution of the Maker Foundation in July.  PaperImperium, who is the DAO’s most powerful delegate, representing roughly 3% of all token voting power, told CoinDesk that the deal has been in the works since 2020.  SocGen did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  Sébastien Derivaux, the head of MakerDAO’s Real World Finance unit, wrote in a reply to the proposal that it “doesn’t have a good risk/reward,” noting that it would require significant developmental resources to pass.  However, he noted that the ancillary benefits of the proposal – specifically, having the legal architecture in place to accept other real-world bank bonds – more than justifies the necessary time and effort.  “This collateral should be seen as step one of what is next to come. Integrating all publicly traded bonds (that will be on Ethereum as we all know) and providing repo. Quite a huge market,” he wrote.

The “Coinbase premium,” an indicator showing the gap between Coinbase’s BTC/U.S. dollar (USD) pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair involving the tether stablecoin, went negative at 14:45 UTC (10:45 a.m. ET) on Friday, according to South Korea-based on-chain data site CryptoQuant, as bitcoin’s price started surging.  “What’s obvious is that this buying didn’t come from U.S. investors,” said Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto trading data firm CryptoQuant. The demand for bitcoin is “likely [from] Chinese or non-U.S. investors.”  While Coinbase is more popular among crypto traders in the U.S. and Europe, Binance, which started in China, is known as one of the most popular exchanges among traders in Asia.  Interestingly, not long after the drop, the Coinbase premium also went positive on CryptoQuant’s site, an indication that some trading bots may have captured the widened gap between Coinbase’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT for arbitrage opportunities, said Ju.  It is unclear what has triggered the sudden, huge appetite for bitcoin on Binance. However, according to market analysts, institutional investors, or bitcoin whales – those with large bitcoin holdings – have shown a more bullish view on bitcoin, especially as markets welcome a new quarter on the financial calendar.  The Oct. 1 rally shows that players in traditional finance may be establishing new positions as the quarter begins, said Dan Burke, managing director of institutional sales in Asia-Pacific at BitGo.  “It’s the furthest day away from new disclosures,” Burke added.  Options markets also support a renewed bullish view from institutional investors.  “After four days of consolidation, bitcoin broke out bullishly above trend line resistance at $44,000, trading rapidly up to a high just shy of $48,000,” Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at crypto over-the-counter (OTC) trading firm Paradigm, told CoinDesk. “Throughout the period of consolidation, we continued to see bullish views being expressed via call spreads from our institutional client base.”  Chu noted that calls dominated Paradigm’s volume on Friday, at about 77%, versus the volume of put options. A call option gives the purchase the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option gives the buyer the right to sell. At the moment, strong interest is showing at strikes between $50,000 and $100,000, according to Paradigm.  “There has been quite some bullish bets for topside, especially targeting a move back towards the all-time high before the end of year,” Chu said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/01/coinbase-premium-indicates-whales-on-binance-may-be-behind-bitcoins-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14215da762d80fa70b92c8a83b0b77d782c33a8b-1504x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421738,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpGk1,1633109829,Introducing the Decentralized Money Stack,"This week, when the team at MIT Technology Review put me into a fireside chat with journalist Charlotte Jee during their Emtech MIT conference, the assigned title for the session – “Demystifying Decentralized Finance” – got me thinking.  It occurred to me that before we demystify DeFi, or for that matter the wider ecosystem of blockchains and digital assets, we need to first demystify traditional finance (TradFi).  Most people don’t have a solid understanding of how our capitalist system of payments, credit and asset transfers works. Getting to that understanding, I believe, requires looking into the deep historical roots of money and the social system of trust that has evolved around it. Only then can we develop a framework for talking about the traditional financial system and how the crypto industry seeks to disrupt it.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  That’s what I’ll attempt to do with this column. First, I’ll categorize what I see as the architectural components of the traditional, centralized, fiat- and banking-based financial system, explaining how each came into being and the purpose it serves. Then I’ll map those components to their equivalents in the new, decentralized, crypto- and smart contract-based system.  A caveat: This is just one way of looking at this issue. It inevitably will have inconsistencies and contradictions. Feel free to email me with feedback, especially if some of my analogies and explanations are off.  The Money Stack  This framework starts with what I’m calling the “money stack” – no, not a stack of money, but an analog to the idea of a software stack.  Let’s look at each part of the stack, its historical antecedents and its role in the financial system.  The Ledger  Historically, the accounting profession has been the butt of jokes, a byword for “boring.” But the humble ledger-keeper is actually the foundation of human society.  It is no coincidence that the very first known examples of writing are the cuneiform records displayed on clay ledger tablets from ancient Mesopotamia, the cradle of civilization. One of those tablets includes what is thought to be the very first name ever recorded: that of a Sumerian accountant by the name of Kushim.  To create a functioning system of exchange, one in which people across a larger community than just a small village could enter into contracts for trading goods and services, societies needed a trustworthy system of record-keeping to keep track of the delivery and settlement of those agreements. That’s what those ancient tablets enabled.  The technology for recording and storing those transactions has, of course, evolved tremendously from clay tablets to giant data farms. But in TradFi, the core governing principle for creating and keeping that trustworthy record hasn’t changed: It’s centralized, maintained by a trusted third party. Once it was Sumerian accountants like Kushim. Now it’s institutions such as banks, internet platforms and applications, or government agencies.  Currency  The true “money” part of the money stack emerged alongside the accounting tablets, at least in the form we currently recognize: currencies. Currencies gave people a medium of exchange, a commonly recognized unit of account with which to measure the worth of a good or service and store of value that can be converted in the future into those things of real value.  To me, money is best understood as a social technology. It’s a system that we all collectively believe in, one that requires a shared foundation of trust in the commonly recognized value of the currency. Getting that trust to scale across large communities required coordination. So, in the absence of a decentralized governance system to achieve that, the state seized that role. The relationship between government and money was formed early on.  A big leap in the technology of money occurred in the late 15th century when the Medici family took double-entry bookkeeping, a version of ancient ledger-keeping first developed in Arabia, and applied it to banking. That enabled a massive scaling of the payments and exchange function of money as it was no longer dependent on transfers of the underlying physical currency. It also forged a deep, symbiotic relationship between banks and the issuers of that physical currency, creating two sides of a centralized system of money.  Debt  Those same banks powered the development of credit. As they became pivotal to monetary systems, they began to accumulate society’s savings, amassing from people with surplus funds a giant pool of otherwise dormant liquidity to repurpose into loans for those with a deficit of funds.  Out of this grew a complex machine for generating credit, a system of interlocking institutions driving economic activity and feeding value back into the banking system in the form of savings. It is the fractional reserve feedback loop that is the basis for most of the money that circulates in our economy. That system now includes a vast array of non-bank investors, lenders and other institutions that power global credit.  Unchecked, this machine inevitably fueled crises as investment bubbles grew and then burst, which led to the formation of central banks and a complex financial regulatory framework that imposes rules on the centralized entities that profit from that system.  Property  The evolution of a more complex economy also required a more complex legal framework for how human beings defined ownership of, first, goods, land and other physical property, and then, contractual rights to services and financial claims.  Property rights were formalized in the form of certificates and deeds in which a certifying authority – such as a land title office – attested to a person’s ownership of the property in question. An important extension of that was the creation of share certificates, which certified an investor’s claim of partial ownership in a limited stock company and their rights to future profit distributions.  Defining rights in this way gave early limited stock companies such as the Dutch East India Co. and the British East India Co. the capacity to mobilize vast amounts of capital.  These days, electronic records rather than paper certificates are used, and they are typically managed by custodial banks on behalf of investing institutions.  The Decentralized Money Stack  The core problem with the TradFi money stack is that all of its components require participants in the system to trust a centralized entity. Someone or some institution must be trusted to keep the ledger, to issue the currency, to coordinate the conversion of short-term savings into longer-term loans and to certify people’s rights to property.  That trust imperative implies that the centralized entity has the capacity to act in its own interests against those of the users of the system. For that reason, society has developed a complex nexus of laws, regulations, accounting and auditing procedures to provide people with the confidence they need to use these services. All of that adds friction to our transactions and, ultimately, burdens the economy with massive costs.  This is where the decentralizing, disintermediating promise of cryptocurrencies, blockchains, digital assets and smart contracts comes in.  These technologies are coming together to forge a decentralized version of the money stack. Here’s how it maps out:  Ledger = blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum  Currency = bitcoin the currency, ether and/or other cryptocurrency payment vehicles  Debt = DeFi  Property = Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)  We have quite a ways to go before this system can fully integrate and scale to the point where it is the default model for global capitalism.  One step in resolving that will be to figure out which parts of the system will still require the engagement of new or traditional centralized entities, and which parts can be handled by permissionless tokens, blockchains and smart contracts. Determining what role is to be played by governments and regulation is also a challenging work in progress.  However, if we can come up with a common understanding of how this new system uses different methods to achieve similar outcomes to that of the old system, this development process will be less torturous. The decentralized money stack is my modest attempt to help in that effort.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

42421730,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpGbl,1633107724,Is Mozilla Trying to Sabotage Distributed Identity?,"Coin Center, the cryptocurrency lobbying group that vaulted into the spotlight during the recent U.S. Senate fight over crypto tax reporting, this week called out the Mozilla Foundation as part of an attempt to “waylay” the development of a distributed identity (DID) data and implementation standard. The Foundation, which develops the Firefox browser and is usually a half-decent supporter of internet privacy and security, filed an objection in early September to the working draft of a new DID standard being developed by the collaborative W3C foundation.  Coin Center, in an open letter this week, characterized those objections in part as “transparently irrelevant,” and more broadly warned that “a promising effort to standardize Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) at the W3C is being waylaid by the objections of centralized digital identity providers.” The new standard would potentially disrupt centralized digital identity providers such as Google and Facebook.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The concept of distributed identity is fairly simple, though a bit tough to explain. At its heart is the idea that identity should be contextual online much the same way it is in real life – that you can offer different pieces of information to prove who you are in different situations. Under such a system, a wide array of issuers would be able to create identity attestations, but service providers could choose which to accept. It would create something like a free market for identity verification, without interfering with the use of “strong” forms of identity like government ID.  Among other benefits, this is a much more secure and private model than the Facebook or Google logins which currently dominate identity verification on the web. That’s in part because service providers could limit the data they see or collect based on their security risk level or specific qualification requirements. Check out CoinDesk’s in-depth explainer on distributed identity for more details.  The Mozilla Foundation’s objections to the proposed standard, though, focused not at all on the core goals of privacy, openness and security. Instead, as Coin Center’s Peter Van Valkenburgh writes, “The Mozilla objection … dedicates the vast majority of its critique to the putative environmental costs of proof-of-work mining. This is transparently irrelevant to the W3C DID standardization process.”  Objections to proof-of-work (PoW) systems on environmental grounds are widespread, but the tone of the Mozilla objection is practically inquisitorial: “We (W3C) can no longer take a wait-and-see or neutral position on technologies with egregious energy use,” it reads. “We must instead firmly oppose such proof-of-work technologies including to the best of our ability blocking them from being incorporated or enabled (even optionally) by any specifications we develop.” Burn the witch, in other words.  Environmental critiques of Bitcoin are, at the very least, still open for debate. It is strange, then, that Mozilla is taking them so much at face value as to say that PoW should be “opposed,” full stop. It is especially strange since the current DID draft standard does not even mention PoW mining, according to Coin Center, and can accommodate many data architectures.  That leads directly to the other horn of Mozilla’s objection: that because it encompasses many different approaches to data, the current DID standard “encourages divergence rather than convergence.” Coin Center argues that this objection is logically incoherent with Mozilla’s crusade against PoW: “How can the standard both be too permissive of various methods (blockchain and non-blockchain) while simultaneously too deterministic in locking the community into a particular method that, it is alleged, would have deleterious environmental consequences?”  Read more: Self-Sovereign Identity Explained  Mozilla’s objection to the diversity built into the DID standard also seems questionable in its own right. “The whole point of DID is interoperability across different methods and therefore trust systems,” said Gregory Rocco, co-founder of Spruce Systems, creators of the SpruceID toolkit for decentralized identity. “Why do pockets of user-owned identity need to fight each other when they can just collaborate using DIDs?” In other words, the “divergence” Mozilla objects to is kind of the point.  Coin Center characterizes Mozilla’s statement as “scare tactics and hyperbole,” and it is certainly a strange and off-putting position from an organization that is usually quite intellectually honest. It will be interesting to see if Mozilla sticks to its guns here, or if insights emerge about deeper motives for its objections.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,David Z.

42376073,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEDAR,1633104119,Rep. Emmer: Government Is ‘Trying to Gain Control Over’ Crypto,"Yesterday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he has no intention of banning cryptocurrencies. It’s unclear whether the unelected monetary body would have that authority in the first place.  “The Fed chair is not so sure what he wants to say,” Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) said this morning on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.” That feeling might apply evenly across the entire U.S. government, Emmer suggested.  According to Emmer, who co-chairs the Congressional Blockchain Caucus with Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.), cryptocurrency has emerged as a citizen’s rights issue, a potential revenue source and a perennial nuisance for a government still trying to figure out what a blockchain is.  “I do believe that they are trying to gain control over the cryptocurrency industry and direct it and that really isn’t conducive to growth and entrepreneurial activity and opportunity,” Emmer said.  The congressman from the Land of 10,000 Lakes sees an overabundance of caution and control over crypto as misguided. “Not only are they risking driving innovation in entrepreneurs outside of the U.S., but they already are,” he said.  In addition to calling the cryptocurrency industry already “overregulated,” Emmer said that the U.S. government should not try to compete directly with the stablecoin sector through a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  “Our Federal Reserve should never be in competition with the private sector,” he said. Emmer added that he would oppose any CBDC that didn’t maintain the basic fungibility and privacy protections of physical cash and coins.  Crypto is now firmly on Washington’s radar. “I think we jumped forward months if not years, in terms of elected officials here in Washington, D.C., taking notice of the crypto industry,” Emmer said.  In fact, crypto’s grassroots and lobbying efforts in face of an unfavorable amendment to the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill was a particular catalyst.  Read more: How Controversial Crypto Tax Found Its Way Into US Infrastructure Bill  “When you have a member who suddenly gets 40,000 phone calls overnight because the crypto community got activated over the Portman amendment, you know, these older senators take notice,” Emmer said.  And the $2 trillion, and growing, price tag on the crypto industry is hard to miss, Emmer said, for a government that’s always looking for new revenue streams.  “Believe me, they’re not going to stop paying attention to it,” Emmer said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/01/rep-emmer-government-is-trying-to-gain-control-over-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41536c125ca594092bd655a9b0c2c9b28b43dda0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421731,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpGZh,1633103308,"We Can Use as Much Energy as We Want, Forever","I am a committed environmentalist, both in my personal life and in my stance on public issues. I’m an Eagle Scout who once spent a month on the Appalachian Trail. I haven’t owned a car in five years, I pay extra to get my home energy from renewable sources and I do my best to minimize single-use plastics (though that’s depressingly difficult these days). I would even love for governments to take much stronger steps on regulating pollution, which the market can’t accurately price.  I say all of this not to pat myself on the back, but to make sure you know exactly where I’m coming from when I say that I find criticisms of the Bitcoin network’s environmental impact to be so astonishingly stupid I question their sincerity. I have been planning for months to lay out the stunning illogic at their heart – but as luck would have it, there’s now a fantastic documentary that does the work for me.  “This Machine Greens” is a 40-minute surgical disemboweling of the environmental case against Bitcoin, presented by Swan Bitcoin and produced by Enrique Posner, former managing director of Warner Brothers’ Spain division. The film was directed by veteran documentarian Jamie King, perhaps best known for 2006′s “Steal This Movie,” a documentary about peer-to-peer file sharing. King learned about bitcoin during the early days of VODO, a film distribution platform that uses peer-to-peer technology.  “It’s sort of my crowning shame that I was very, very early to bitcoin,” says King of the cryptocurrency. “I was implementing it within the first couple of years – VODO started in 2008 and we were experimenting with [bitcoin] in 2011. But we didn’t hold on to any of it.  “You don’t have to write that up.”  Sorry, Jamie. On the record is on the record.  CoinDesk readers are probably familiar with the argument – that the Bitcoin network uses more electricity than Washington State or more energy than Argentina or more energy than American Airlines. There are some statistics to counter these claims, such as a Cambridge University survey that found 39% of hash power used was powered by renewables – but those numbers were self-reported by miners, so they’re largely useless.  What gets me so heated, though, is the plethora of gaping logical fallacies underlying the critique. “This Machine Greens” attacks the most egregious first: the idea that “using energy” is in itself bad. “Every advance in civilization,” King told me, “has hinged on a new innovation in capturing and using energy … from fire to windmills.”  The film draws on the idea of the Kardeshev Scale, which ranks civilizations according to their utilization of available energy. On Earth, we’re just learning to harness the power of the sun, meaning there is still a staggering amount of waste energy waiting to be tapped. In the grand scheme of things, we should be aiming to use more energy, not less.  Of course, there is the small issue of global warming: The excluded premise of most critiques of Bitcoin’s energy usage is the idea that most energy today is of the carbon-generating variety. But “This Machine Greens” compellingly makes the exact opposite argument, citing three factors. The profitability of mining bitcoin hinges heavily on electrical costs; renewables are now the cheapest way to generate electricity; and bitcoin mining has no geographic restrictions. Add those up, and the Bitcoin system creates incentives to seek out and build renewable energy.  Another thing that triggers me about the “Bitcoin uses too much energy” argument is the implication that other financial tools, and the people who run them, somehow magically don’t use energy. It’s a basic tenet of financial and business reporting that numbers should be presented in context, but many media outlets seem to make an exception in this case. “This Machine Greens” outlines the obvious corrective truth: The existing monetary system already generates a whole lot of carbon.  In fact, the film goes further, arguing that Bitcoin’s “proof of work” system is part of a much longer legacy of money production based on seemingly “wasted” labor or resources. That applies to gold mining, native American wampum and the notorious Yap stones, all of which devote huge resources and specialized talent to creating mediums of exchange that are difficult or impossible to fake. Wampum even became subject to pseudo-industrial production, with entire Native American villages focused on the task in lieu of “productive” work.  “The only difference is its scale,” King points out. “If you don’t think there was anything wrong with native Americans making wampum … bitcoin is the same.”  In the here and now, the dollar’s connection to energy use is even more nefarious. According to “This Machine Greens,” the Bretton Woods agreement that took the U.S. dollar off the gold standard was closely tied to deals with OPEC nations to price oil sales in dollars. This created the “petrodollar,” which has been defended for decades with untold military spending by the U.S. And no, in case you’re wondering, F-16 jets don’t run on solar power.  (Much of that military action was also sold to the public using official lies that, as writer Rebecca Solnit has argued, led us directly into Qanon-land. But that bedtime story will have to wait.)  The film also offers some correctives on the question of scale, which are less airtight as rebuttals but still important. Mainstream media headlines focus on comparing small countries to Bitcoin, but it feels much different to learn that the godforsaken cruise industry uses twice as much energy as Bitcoin, or that digital devices in always-on mode use 12 times as much energy as Bitcoin, just for the fleeting convenience of a quick startup.  This, by the way, actually understates the damage done by the cruise industry. Many cruise ships still burn bunker fuel, an ultra-cheap, ultra-low-quality maritime diesel that looks like black tar and produces massive amounts of particulates when burned. Those particulates are not classified as greenhouse gases by the Environmental Protection Agency and are not calculated as part of national totals under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. That’s essentially a giant giveaway to the cruise industry at the expense of every human on Earth who, you know, breathes air.  Read More: El Salvador’s Bitcoin Volcano Can Be a Model for Cleaner Crypto | David Z. Morris  And for that, we get floating cheap hotels featuring buffets with 100 different preparations of corn syrup, designed to give the most lazy, sheltered people in the world the delusion they’re “traveling.” So I say we should ban cruises now to stop global warming. Sink the distasteful hulk of the Harmony of the Seas to the bottom of the ocean to replace dying coral reefs so at least something good will have come from this massive waste of human capital and resources.  Such an argument runs into an inevitable hurdle, though: If you actually like cruises (no accounting for taste), you may think it’s worth it to burn all that bunker fuel. By the same token, most arguments against Bitcoin’s energy use presume that the energy is being wasted, without actually supporting that assumption. In essence, talking about energy use is a trick, a way to make the argument that “Bitcoin is just a scam” at a time when that argument is becoming less tenable by the day.  “There is no amount of persuading you that this [usage] is a good energy policy if you don’t think Bitcoin has [social] value,” says Enrique Posner, the documentary’s producer.  Debating which uses of electricity are ‘acceptable’ is not just pointless but dangerous  And ultimately, that’s the most enraging and stupid element of the Bitcoin energy argument. Efficiency is one thing, and I’m all for using less energy for every possible application. But debating which uses of electricity are “acceptable” is not just pointless but dangerous. As humans we have immensely divergent priorities, and the totality of our individual cost-benefit analyses is how democratic societies set social priorities. The Bitcoin energy critics seem to imagine some friendly authority who can define and enforce “acceptable” uses of energy, but you can probably think of several strong terms to describe such a system.  If you’re not a puppet of the petrodollar or a complete dunce, you probably understand that the real focus right now needs to be on energy production, not banning consumption you don’t like. Have more concern-troll articles been written about Bitcoin’s energy use, or the fact that governments worldwide spend $500 billion a year to subsidize fossil fuel production? Or that U.S. courts are being subverted to punish a lawyer who had the temerity to win an environmental case against Chevron? Which is really more of a problem?

42396817,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5cIz,1633098762,Fitch: Debt Ceiling Fight Could Endanger ‘AAA’ Rating of US,"Rating agency Fitch has issued a warning that congressional debate on whether to raise the debt ceiling could threaten the ‘AAA’ rating of the United States.  The warning illustrates how debt ceiling fights – even if they don’t end in default – can spook markets, potentially creating an aversion to risk among investors that could rattle bitcoin.  It also puts into perspective how congressional spats over the debt ceiling threaten the U.S.’ status as the world’s provider of safe-haven assets.  “Fitch believes that the debt limit will be raised or suspended in time to avert a default event, but if this were not done in a timely manner, political brinkmanship and reduced financing flexibility could increase the risk of a U.S. sovereign default,” the agency said.  Fitch’s note is reminiscent of the 2011 debt ceiling fight that caused another rating agency, Standard and Poor (S&P), to downgrade the U.S.’ rating.  Speaking before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen advocated for abolishing the debt ceiling.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/01/fitch-debt-limit-fight-could-endanger-uss-aaa-rating,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/368b6df889c1e79da61e8fb9754bf23d37baa583-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Past pattern may shed light on whether this is just a dead cat bounce or a lead up to a real move up. Bitcoin Netflows Of Past Dead Cat Bounces Compared As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, a look at the BTC netflows of the past cycles may reveal the pattern that dead cat bounces have followed historically. The Bitcoin exchange &apos;netflow&apos; is an indicator that&apos;s defined as the difference between the inflow and the outflow. When exchanges observe higher inflows compared to the outflows, their reserves gain a net amount of BTC and the netflow shows positive values. On the other hand, higher outflows lead to a net amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges, and so the netflow takes negative values. Sustained negative values of the indicator have usually been bullish for the price of the coin as they imply that there is a buying pressure in the market while positive values can be bearish. Now, here is how the 2018 dead cat bounce looked like with the netflows: The Bitcoin netflows during 2018 As you can see in the above graph, the indicator showed highly positive values during the formation of the dead cat bounce in 2018.

However, with Gamezone and $GZONE, the concept goes much further than that. It is a way to earn passive revenue, generate profit potential, and access the future of blockchain gaming rolled into one. $GZONE Profit Potential Doesn&apos;t Trigger A Sell-Off Historically, numerous new token launches have surged in value and saw early investors liquidate positions relatively quickly. It can be hard to pass up on a 20x from one&apos;s original investment, as it represents a significant profit. For GameZone&apos;s native $GZONE token, investors treat the market somewhat differently. Even after a 100x ROI, very few people intend to sell their tokens. Nevertheless, you cannot underestimate the long-term potential of this asset. The current 100x ROI is not surprising either. GameZone is developed by the BlueZilla team, which has launched various launchpad services across prominent blockchain ecosystems. Their latest venture for Velas, dubbed VelasPad, noted a 150x ROI within the first two days, indicating there may be more to come for $GZONE. So even though the platform&apos;s focus is different, the long-term approach can bring continuous value to the token. As $GZONE acts deflationary, it can be rewarding to hold for the long term. Stakers will earn revenue from every sale that occurs and get a cut from the fee charged to those who unstake ear...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | ZRX,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/the-100x-roi-for-gamezones-gzone-confirms-the-viability-of-blockchain-gaming/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The monster-battling game that uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to reward players made 64,933.71 ether (ETH), worth $220.32 million, in September, down from a record $342 million in August, data center Axie World shows. While September’s figure represents a nearly 3,000-fold year-over-year growth, it’s only about 10% of the pace of the month before.  Among blockchain-based applications, Axie’s monthly revenue was second only to Ethereum’s $830 million, according to data provided by Token Terminal. The popularity of the play-to-earn economy is evident from the fact that Axie Infinity earned significantly more revenue than decentralized finance (DeFi) heavyweights like Aave, Compound, Curve and SushiSwap.  Launched by Sky Mavis in 2018, Axie infinity came into the limelight in the early third quarter as yield compression in bitcoin and DeFi drove hot money into gaming and NFTs.  The game has become a significant source of income in countries like Brazil, the Philippines, Venezuela and Vietnam. It’s become so popular in the Philippines, that the government has expressed its intention to tax Axie players.  Axie allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as “axies,” which are digitized as their own NFTs. The game has two utility tokens, smooth love potions (SLPs) and axie infinity shards (AXS), which can be easily converted to cash.  Breeding fees accounted for nearly 90% of the income in September, while the rest was earned from marketplace fees.  The AXS token was trading near $78 at press time, up over 14,000% on a year-to-date basis, according to TradingView data. Prices reached a high of $95 in early September before retreating with the broader crypto market in the wake of China’s blanket ban on virtual currency businesses.  “China’s crypto ban resulted in some downside for the token, but that was largely due to the high correlation nature of digital assets,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, said in a LinkedIn post. “The underlying fundamentals remain very much intact, and demand for AXS and its ‘play-to-earn’ model will likely accelerate going forward.”",NEGATIVE,AXS | ETH,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/01/play-to-earn-giant-axie-infinitys-revenue-tanked-40-in-september,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/679946fcb8208c387043eb82217587f0b26ba7d0-1400x811.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The metaverse describes a vast ecosystem of often interconnected virtual environments, where players can interact with one another, explore parallel digital worlds, and buy and trade tokenized collectibles with real-world value. The metaverse concept is not native to crypto, incidentally - the term comes from Neal Stephenson&apos;s sci-fi novel Snow Crash, published in 1992. Three decades and a raging pandemic later, the metaverse concept is gaining ground as a range of virtual experiences become available, many of them built on blockchain rails.

It will revolutionize the DeFi space and foster the adoption of crypto in a safe, secure, easy and rewarding way. BabyCake&apos;s primary goal was to make it simple for our mothers to start earning passive income without having to understand this complicated DeFi world, and with this App, they have succeeded. So who or what is BabyCake? The company was founded by two friends, Monk and Halo. Their passion is helping people take control of their lives and elevate their situations through the use of DeFi to earn passive income. The first step towards achieving that goal was to create the BabyCake token. It is an innovative Reflection Token, one that pays dividends in an already established token instead of its own. Seven percent of the daily volume is paid out to the holders in $Cake, the native token of PancakeSwap, the premier BSC...",POSITIVE,없음,ICO | MARKET,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/babycake-bringing-defi-to-the-masses/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42396826,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5cPs,1633049359,Old Meets New as Czech Royal Family Drops High-Art NFTs,"A Czech royal family that traces its heritage to the 14th century is dabbling in non-fungible tokens (NFT).  The House of Lobkowicz is conducting an NFT drop next month with a goal of “preserving cultural heritage.”  It’s the latest twist in a blockchain phenomenon that has seen everyone from rapper Lil Yachty to fashion designers Dolce and Gabbana join in.  The nonprofit House of Lobkowicz has retained and preserved historic paintings by Pieter Bruegel, Canaletto and Diego Velázquez, as well as hand-annotated musical manuscripts by Wolfgang Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven. Some of the works and historic pieces will be featured in the upcoming NFT launch.  Czech Prince William Rudolf Lobkowicz, 27, told CoinDesk that during the pandemic he developed digital content and virtual tours that allowed fans to view his family’s cultural heritage from their homes. It was during this time that he became increasingly interested in NFTs.  “We lost 95% of our revenue sources which came from cultural tourism,” Lobkowicz said. “We started with doing a whole bunch of digital activities that included virtual tours such as yoga and historic spaces as a way to get people’s minds off the pandemic. We did something helpful.”  The tech-savvy prince said by holding online tours, the House of Lobkowicz received more virtual visitors in 2020 than it had physical visitors during its busiest year.  Lobkowicz said he will be holding a “Non-Fungible Castle” conference and a weeklong public NFT exhibition hosted at the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague on Oct. 11-16.  The Lobkowicz NFTs will feature historic pieces that tell stories digitally and will include a painting with a hidden story and a musical piece that has been unheard for 250 years. That piece was composed by Anna Maria Wilhelmina Althann, the wife of Philipp Hyacinth, who was a prince during the 16th century.  Another NFT will feature a painting by Paolo Veronese revealing a hidden detail discovered through X-ray imagery. There will also be an animation of 16th-century sgraffito, a decorative form, from the façade of Nelahozeves Castle, decaying and restoring over time.  Lobkowicz said his family spent more than 600 years collecting art and supporting the field, and he stressed this “new technology” is not just about displaying and buying digital art but is an experiment to see if “NFTs and their underlying technology will retain value for centuries.”  Lobkowicz said digital art has many advantages over physical art. For example, it can travel around the world in an instant, unlike the family collections that can’t be sold or leave the country without permission from a central governmental authority.  “NFTs can potentially offer cultural institutions a new patronage model,” Lobkowicz said, adding:  “By investing in an NFT, a patron receives ownership of a unique digital asset, while also directly supporting conservation efforts or other important cultural initiatives.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/30/old-meets-new-as-czech-royal-family-drops-high-art-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/356ab171daed97c79ea7bbd1f81990f1f56254d1-1800x1201.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Securitize has been issuing security tokens since 2017 through its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission-registered transfer agent. Now it can sell and trade them through its alternative trading system (ATS), which is run by its broker-dealer. (Securitize acquired both the broker-dealer and ATS licenses last year.)  “We want to facilitate liquidity to companies earlier on without having to go through the expensive and lengthy process of registering with the SEC,” said Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo. “We also want to give the opportunity to individual investors to invest in these companies early on and get a return that is otherwise not available to the public.”  The marketplace is launching with four issuers, mostly venture capital firms in the blockchain and digital assets market, but Securitize plans to draw in firms from outside the crypto ecosystem in the future. In the coming weeks, four more issuers are expected to join, including digital wallet firm Exodus, which also issues security tokens on tZero.  It took Securitize three months to transfer the license and another eight months to get the final regulatory approval to launch, said Scott Harrigan, CEO of Securitize Markets.  “Because of the stringent regulatory requirements imposed on alternative trading systems (ATSs), it understandably took some time for regulators to review and fully vet our application to operate the digital asset security ATS,” Harrigan said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/28/securitize-launches-its-secondary-marketplace-for-trading-tokenized-securities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/982573b7f8da50f077bc68799f4eb49293316a84-2000x1335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374471,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZmsb,1633049119,"Move Over, Carry Trade, These Retail-Friendly DeFi Options Strategies Yield 12%-30%","The crypto “cash-and-carry” trade – where traders simultaneously enter into a long position on bitcoin or ether (ETH) in the spot market and then a short position in the futures market, a way of betting on eventual convergence of the two prices – has lost its shine.  Reliable for 30% annualized gains earlier this year, the opportunity has since shrunk to single digits, as the frenzied bullishness witnessed in cryptocurrency markets earlier this year faded and as major exchanges reined in leverage.  But investors can still make double-digit returns via weekly ether or bitcoin “covered call” strategies offered by decentralized finance (DeFi) asset management platforms, including Ribbon Finance and StakeDAO. And it’s a heck of a lot easier; all you have to do is deposit coins in “strategy vaults” designed to automate the trade.  A popular traditional market strategy, “covered calls” involve selling out-of-the-money (OTM) call options, or those with strike prices above the current market level, while owning the underlying asset. It is typically seen as a neutral to bullish strategy, because the upside is capped. A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option buyer is implicitly bullish, while the seller anticipates a price drop or consolidation and receives a premium for offering insurance to the purchaser.  At press time, projected yields from Stake DAO’s ETH and BTC covered call strategies were 31% and 32%, respectively, while Ribbon Finance’s ETH covered call offered a 12% yield.  Check that versus the cash-and-carry trades executed on Binance, the world’s largest centralized crypto exchange by volume: Traders would earn just 5%.  Just automate  With Stake DAO and Ribbon Finance, the strategy is automated. Users deposit their coins, wrapped ETH (wETH) or wrapped BTC (wBTC), into the strategy vaults, which take care of the complexities, like selecting the appropriate strike price for selling the weekly option.  These structured products open doors for the retail crowd to participate and earn yield from the otherwise complex options market, dominated mainly by sophisticated traders and institutions with ample capital and experience.  Where there’s the potential for outsize gains, there’s always risk. In addition to the market risks, DeFi protocols are prone to glitches and are sometimes targeted by sophisticated crypto-savvy attackers on the prowl for loopholes in the underlying code or flaws in the design.  But the emergence of this new category of offerings in the crypto options marketplace provides yet another example of how blockchain-industry developers are engineering cryptocurrency projects to replicate the structured-finance alchemy pioneered by Wall Street, and in some cases taking it to the next level.  “Options or derivatives can be pretty intimidating for retail traders,” Wade Prospere, head of marketing and community at decentralized options marketplace Opyn, told CoinDesk. ”Structured products such as Ribbon Finance and Stake DAO abstract away all the complexities involved in options trading like determining the strike price.” Both Ribbon Finance and Stake DAO use Opyn’s infrastructure to mint and trade the option tokens on-chain.  Launched in April, Ribbon Finance owns 95% of the DeFi asset management market, and its vaults are 30 times larger than those of Stake DAO. On Sept. 14, Ribbon finance announced the launch of its first two Ribbon V2 Vaults – the ETH Covered Call vault and the WBTC Covered Call Vault. For now, both V1 and V2 vaults are running concurrently.  While Ribbon’s staff plays the role of a vault manager and selects the strike price for the options, in V2 the process of selecting strikes is fully autonomous.  Meanwhile, Stake DAO manually selects the strikes at which options are sold, consistently targeting 10% delta options, which correspond to a strike price generally 25% above the current price. Early Thursday, Stake DAO launched DeFi’s first-ever open arbitrage strategy on the Avalanche platform.  Dissecting the strategy  Every Friday at 11:00 coordinated universal time (7 a.m. ET), Ribbon Finance’s vault keeps 10% of user funds aside and deposits 90% as collateral at Opyn to mint weekly European ETH call options. The vault receives Opyn’s oTokens, representing the ETH call options, and selects the strike price or the level at which calls are to be sold. One option contract is for 1 ETH.  The vault then sells these ETH calls over DeFi peer-to-peer marketplace Airswap in return for the options premium (paid in ether) by buyers, mostly market makers. The premium received represents the yield from the strategy and is distributed to users in proportion to their deposits.  Last Friday, Ribbon Finance minted and sold 13.2 million contracts of ether 3,500 strike call options expiring on Oct. 1. The vault received more than 33 ETH worth $94,955 in premium.  If ether remains below $3,500 on Friday, the options will expire worthless, and user deposits held as collateral at Opyn will be transferred back to users via Ribbon’s vault.  Risk profile  If the options expire in-the-money, say with ether settling at $3,600, options buyers (holders of oTokens) can exercise their options by withdrawing ETH from the Opyn vault. The amount withdrawn is equal to the difference between the strike price and the market price of ETH on the expiration date.  The options are cash-settled, and so for each option contract, buyers can withdraw $100 per contract in ETH from the vault ($3,600 minus $3,500). Any leftover ETH will be returned to the depositors.  The chart above shows that vault depositors keep the yield from options premiums even when the options expire in the money, but the loss incurred is taken from the ETH collateral deposited. In other words, vault depositors lose the upside in ether once the cryptocurrency moves above the strike price at which calls have been sold.  Ribbon’s other products – the USDC-collateralized ETH put selling strategy and the WBTC covered call strategy – operate along similar lines.  Stake DAO’s ETH and BTC covered call strategies beef up returns by putting collateral (user deposits) to work in automated market maker Curve’s eCRV or sETH-ETH pool. The liquidity provider (LP) tokens received from Curve are then used as collateral to mint options at Opyn.  “We place those LP tokens from Curve inside the ETH covered call cycle,” Julien Bouteloup, founder of Stake DAO and Stake Capital, said. “That way, users earn yield from being liquidity provider at Curve in addition to premium received from selling call options.”  Both Stake DAO’s and Ribbon Finance’s vaults reinvest the yield earned from selling call options back into the strategy, compounding returns for depositors over time.  Why DeFi options  ETH or BTC holders can book a covered call strategy on a centralized exchange like Deribit by depositing their holdings and selling OTM calls.  In this case, the onus of determining the right strike price (the level at which the option is sold) lies with the trader. The job is easier said than done as traders need to assess historical volatility and expected volatility to come up with a strike price high enough so that with reasonable price movements, the option expires worthless. At the same time, it should be close enough to the market price to allow maximum inflow of premium. Higher strike calls trade relatively cheap versus lower strike calls.  With Stake DAO and Ribbon Finance, users get to bypass the hassle of studying market conditions and determining the apt strike price. As the Bankless newsletter wrote in an explanatory piece on Aug. 3, “two transactions and voilá, you’re in and earning automated returns in complex DeFi strategies.”  “The goal is to build a decentralized exchange that anyone can use and don’t necessarily need to understand the difficult concepts,” Bouteloup told CoinDesk. Bouteloup added that with centralized exchanges, users don’t have the option of boosting yields by putting collateral to work as Stake DAO does.  The DeFi structured products provide investors an opportunity to express various market views with tailor-made products.  Julian Koh, co-founder of Ribbon Finance, said the vaults help users by spreading out gas costs and making the strategy affordable to everyone. Gas refers to the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction or execute a contract on Ethereum’s blockchain. It tends to spike when the network faces congestion as it did following the recent Time magazine NFT launch. One address paid $70,000 for 10 of Time’s non-fungible tokens.  Such astronomical fees make it impossible for small investors to access DeFi protocols. Vaults alleviate this problem by distributing the gas costs across all depositors.  “Instead of doing three to four transactions per week per user, the vault will do three to four transactions per week for thousands of users at once,” Ribbon Finance’s official blog said. “This makes the user experience of using these Option Vaults extremely straightforward and relatively cheap – deposit, wait for yields and withdraw.”  Ribbon Finance’s ETH covered call vault has a maximum deposit capacity of 25,000 ETH, while StakeDAO’s strategy vault has an upper limit of 750 ETH.  “Vault limits have been introduced to make sure things don’t get too big too quickly,” Ribbon Finance’s Koh said. “We want to test the system cautiously.”  The future looks bright for the sub-sector, particularly with centralized avenues like Binance drawing regulatory ire. “As the fixed income and derivatives markets for crypto continue to mature, we will no doubt continue to see exciting developments in the structured products space from Ribbon Finance and other DeFi protocols continuing into the future,” Messari’s Alexander Beasant noted.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/30/move-over-carry-trade-these-retail-friendly-defi-options-strategies-yield-12-30,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4bdd7f58573a97937934013327c6b7abc8e8f8b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374468,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZmq5,1633048631,Ethereum’s September Losses Were Gains for Competitors,"A battle of smart contract blockchains played out in cryptocurrency markets this month as upstarts Avalanche and Solana posted double-digit returns, while the dominant Ethereum network’s ether (ETH) token suffered steep losses.  Avalanche’s AVAX token jumped 52% during the month, the top performance among digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $10 billion tracked by data firm Messari. Solana, championed by Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, saw its SOL token gain 23%. Terra’s LUNA token rose 7.5%.  Such gains came as ether lost 23% during the month. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, whose network isn’t considered a smart contract blockchain, slid 12% in September.  Smart contracts are taking center stage while there’s speculation over which network will play host to the fast-growing businesses that developers are building on these blockchains, from decentralized finance to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Increasing activity on these chains and surging fees, or “gas prices,” on Ethereum might be eroding the sector leader’s dominance, according to a report from Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at Messari.  “Unsurprisingly, speculators are piling into these platforms’ corresponding tokens as Ethereum’s dominance gets thrown into question,” Watkins said.  Traders’ recent preference for Ethereum competitors contrasts with the situation earlier this year, when the dominant network’s fast growth riveted investors, and ETH staged a rapid rally. Its market share has risen rapidly and now accounts for 26% of investment products, compared with 11% in January, said James Butterfill, an investment strategist at CoinShares.  Ether’s price is still up nearly fourfold this year, versus a 46% for bitcoin. But Avalanche’s AVAX has jumped 20-fold this year, for a market capitalization of $14 billion. And SOL has multiplied 74-fold, to $41 billion.  “Investors really liked the world computer idea of Ethereum,” Butterfill said. “But due to price rises it has revealed an inefficient network and high gas fees.” This is why there’s a spillover of interest into rival networks, particularly ones that don’t have high transaction costs, he added.  Below the $10 billion threshold, smart contract blockchains also outperformed in September. Algorand’s ALGO token jumped 38%, and Cosmos’s ATOM was up 35%. Tezos (XTZ) rose 10%.  Ironically, Cardano, which implemented its long-awaited smart contract functionality earlier this month, was one of the biggest losers. The blockchain, whose development is led by a former Ethereum developer Charles Hoskinson, saw its ADA token plunge 28%.  Analysts have said that Cardano’s downturn might be a case of buy the rumor, sell the fact, because speculators had bid up the price in anticipation of the upgrade.  Some of the gains were perhaps driven by the rollout of incentive programs, including rewards for users – sometimes akin to free money for those willing to take the time – as well as grants for coders to build or advance new applications . On Sept. 16, Avalanche completed a $230 million private sale of AVAX tokens to crypto funds. Alogrand launched a $300 million fund to support decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation.  “Blockchains are competing to attract talent,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital. “One of the easiest ways to incentivize software developers to build on one chain versus the other is to help with funding,”  Martin Gaspar, a research analyst at CrossTower, attributed the surge to “rising investor optimism on smart contract chains (AVAX and ALGO),” in an email to CoinDesk.  Without developers, according to Vinokourov, there won’t be new projects or new prospective users. Developers are particularly scarce at the moment, he said, and so those incentives are being pushed.  “It goes to show that there is a lot of money sitting on the sidelines,” Vinokourov said.",NEGATIVE,AVAX | ETH | SOL,AVAX | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/30/ethereums-september-losses-were-gains-for-its-competitors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41e6283d670226852a22305e8e4f7630c7dfc653-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency experienced a volatile September and is down about 11% for the month to date, compared to a 4% loss in the S&P 500 stock index over the same period.  But looking to October, some analysts expect a recovery in cryptocurrency prices. Historically bitcoin generates positive returns in the fourth quarter, according to the data, and that could limit selling pressure.  Technical indicators show support, or the price level that an asset does not fall below for period of time, at $40,000, although resistance remains strong around $50,000, where buyers took some profit earlier this month. “Ultimately BTC needs a break (daily price close) above $47,000 to mark a resumption of the broader uptrend,” Michael Boutros, analyst at DailyFX, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.

Most of ALGO’s price rally was attributed to Algorand’s $300 million decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation fund launched on Sept. 10.  Bitcoin also outperformed a majority of CoinDesk 20 despite the higher volatility in September. Meanwhile, AAVE, DOGE and ETH experienced losses greater than 20% in September.  Outside of the CoinDesk 20, several alternative cryptocurrencies experienced strong gains this month. View more crypto performance statistics on the CoinDesk Data page.  A positive October?  “Bears start to hibernate” in autumn, FundStrat, a global advisory firm, wrote in a Wednesday newsletter, referring to bitcoin’s tendency to produce positive gains in October.  “Overall, [bitcoin] has fared quite well in October, often following abysmal September performances with meteoric rebounds,” FundStrat wrote. “We think this is useful data for those investors discouraged by recent volatility.”  Historically, equities also produce positive returns in October, albeit vulnerable to volatile swings. November is typically the strongest month for both equities and cryptocurrencies.  Price pops before incentives  Coincidence or insider trading? Blockchain data shows recent surges in the days leading up to multimillion-dollar user acquisition programs, reports CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen.  Days before blockchains Celo, Avalanche and Algorand announced major incentive programs, trading volumes across all centralized exchanges for their respective tokens were rising steadily, as were their prices, according to data compiled by the crypto analysts at Kaiko.  For example, before Algorand announced its $300 million DeFi fund, the price of its token ALGO had been climbing for a few days – this positive growth in pricing was also little affected by a broader market sell-off at the time.  According to some sources who spoke to CoinDesk on the subject, it is still possible that insider trading was involved in the pre-event price pump. Read more here.

Powell made the comments in a two-hour long House Financial Services Committee meeting on Thursday. The meeting, meant to serve as a forum for representatives to ask Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Powell about the Treasury Department’s and Federal Reserve’s pandemic response, featured several questions about cryptocurrencies.  Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), a longtime proponent of crypto and a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, asked Powell to clarify statements he had made during a July hearing that the development of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) could undercut the need for private crypto and stablecoins.  When asked by Budd directly whether or not he intended to “ban or limit the use of cryptocurrencies,” Powell’s response was a resounding “No.”  “[I have] no intention to ban them,” he said.  Powell’s remarks come just two days after he asked Congress for consultation and legislative support to develop the digital dollar. Some in the crypto community have speculated that the establishment of a U.S. CBDC would lead to bans on private crypto, as was recently seen in China, but Powell’s remarks suggest otherwise.  When asked about stablecoins, Powell compared them to money market funds or bank deposits.  “They’re to some extent outside the regulatory perimeter, and it’s appropriate that they be regulated. Same activity, same regulation,” Powell said.  Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), also a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, remarked on the lack of regulatory clarity surrounding digital assets, and asked Yellen to define digital assets for tax-accounting purposes.  Yellen deflected the question, saying that the IRS was in the process of issuing “detailed regulations that will answer that question.” This upcoming report is one of several the Treasury Department has promised in recent months, including a highly anticipated report on stablecoins set to be released in the coming weeks. An IRS spokesperson referred CoinDesk to the Treasury Department when asked for comment.  Privacy concerns  The issue of financial privacy was also a theme at Thursday’s hearing, with three representatives – Reps. David Kustoff (R-Tenn.), Trey Hollingsworth (R-Ind.) and William Timmons (R-S.C.) – bringing up concerns about the a push by the IRS to enact new regulations requiring banks to report annual inflows and outflows from all accounts with over $600.  Yellen confirmed the IRS’ plans, saying they were necessary to address an estimated $7 trillion tax gap.  “Yes, we have proposed both augmenting the resources of the IRS ... so that the IRS gets insight into opaque sources of income.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/30/fed-chair-powell-says-he-has-no-intention-of-banning-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4093cef4d7c9babb9f84f1095d006eecfa3dc04d-5758x3839.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
