42433419,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQohh,1608762236,Presidential Advisory Group Weighs In on Regulatory Approach to Stablecoins,"Stablecoins should meet the same regulatory standards as other aspects of the financial system, says U.S. President Trump’s Working Group on Financial Markets.      The working group published a report Wednesday detailing how it views retail payments using stablecoins and asking for public feedback on the issue.      Stablecoins must meet appropriate money-laundering and oversight requirements, the document said:    “Where a stablecoin that is primarily used for retail payments is adopted at a significant scale in the United States, the associated risks may require additional safeguards. We encourage relevant participants engaged in the design of such stablecoin arrangements and their functions, operations, transactions, and risk management to align with key principles.”    These principles include addressing financial stability risks, among others.      U.S. regulators should coordinate among each other and with international partners to ensure they keep up with the space, the document said.      The working group, which includes Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Heath Tarbert, was formed in the late 1980s by President Ronald Reagan, and is tasked with overseeing and nurturing the U.S.’ financial markets.      In a statement, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks said he appreciates the ""productive balance"" the group reached on the issue.

""The prime brokerage offering has been our anchor product since we launched it,"" Bequant CEO George Zarya said in an interview. ""We tailored it to quants, prop traders and arbitrageurs that are the clients of prime brokers. Prime brokers minimize the counterparty risk on exchanges and allows for a high level of capital efficiency.""      After Coinbase acquired crypto prime broker Tagomi in May, it was able to facilitate at least $425 million of MicroStrategy's blockbuster bitcoin buy through its Coinbase Prime service. Such are the stakes for establishing a prime brokerage arm in the time of heightened institutional interest.      Prime brokers are facilitators for financing and trading for deep-pocketed institutional investors. While the digital asset space doesn’t currently have a lot of prime broker options, several crypto firms, including Coinbase, BitGo and Genesis Trading, have announced this year their plans to build prime brokerage wings.      Read more: Behind ‘Prime Broker’ Buzzword Lies a Complex Strategy Game for Crypto Firms      Bequant’s prime brokerage services include capital introduction, fund administration, securities lending, multi-exchange direct market access, custody, collateral management, leveraged trade execution, over-the-counter block trading, risk management and smart-order routing.    Licensure upgrade    Since late August 2018, the company has been operating its prime brokerage and crypto exchange services provisionally under the Virtual Financial Assets Act while in close conversation with the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), Zarya said.      The licenses will allow Bequant to continue operating its crypto exchange and to offer prime brokerage services to its clients.      In total, both approvals required Bequant to hold €730,000 in reserve and to have policies and procedures reviewed by the Malta Financial Services Authority, Zarya added.      Having gone through this rigor already will allow Bequant to apply for other securities licenses in Malta with relative ease in the future, Zarya said, potentially allowing the firm to handle tokenized securities and derivatives.      “The prime brokerage product has been our anchor since we launched it,” Zarya said. “In the new year, the major milestone for the industry is going to be an increased scrutiny on exchanges by clients as the market becomes more institutional.”      The firm is now connected to 14 exchanges and five over-the-countert desks as sources of liquidity, up from 11 sources in August.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/23/crypto-firm-bequant-earns-maltas-in-principle-approval-for-prime-broker-license,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e64c32cc9eed778a957b415cb7bacffe8cf657dd-1500x843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433440,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQpHh,1608758969,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rangebound as XRP Plummets After SEC Lawsuit,"Bitcoin's price continues to trade below $24,000 as legal action against Ripple Labs rattled the XRP market. Bitcoin is the only asset in the CoinDesk20 with a positive 24-hour return as of 4 p.m. ET.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $23,500 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET) gaining less than 1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $22,822.26 to $24,086.95.  XRP's sell-off continues with the token's price dropping another 40% to $0.27 Wednesday.    The price of bitcoin has been bouncing between $22,000 and $24,000 since Friday.      Despite its monster rally through the fourth quarter of 2020, bitcoin's volatility has stayed low. There was a slight increase in December as bitcoin continued setting new record highs, but 180-day volatility has been sitting at its lowest levels since February 2017, per data from Coin Metrics.      Where the price heads next is anyone's guess. But on Twitter, Ki Young Ju, CEO of cryptocurrency data provider CryptoQuant, shared his bullishness, saying, ""BTC will break $25,000 without retesting $21,000.""      Part of the reason for Ju's prediction are the large outflows from Coinbase, which could be viewed as transfers to Coinbase cold storage following new over-the-counter deals for institutional clients.      Sharing Ju's market outlook, Zoran Scekic, managing partner at cryptocurrency trading firm Zorax Capital, also took to Twitter, calling bitcoin's market conditions a ""consolidation or up"" trend. Regardless of what it's called, bitcoin's current trend has resulted in over 200% year-to-date returns, with a roughly 20% gain so far in December.      Along the way, bitcoin's correlation to traditional markets has continued to weaken, per data from Coin Metrics, with the 90-day correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 stock index at its lowest level since just before the market crash in March 2020.    Ripple    Following news of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple, XRP investors are facing a very un-merry Christmas weekend. The fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization crashed more than 40% Wednesday as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), trading hands around $0.27.      Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse warned Monday the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) planned to file a lawsuit, per prior CoinDesk reporting. Sure enough, on Tuesday afternoon the SEC filed a suit that claimed Ripple Labs violated federal securities laws in selling the XRP cryptocurrency to retail consumers.      Some organizations are taking a wait-and-see approach to this news, such as Ripple partner MoneyGram, which said it has yet to see any “negative impact” on its business arrangements with Ripple following the SEC lawsuit.      But some investors aren't being as patient. Cryptocurrency money manager Bitwise liquidated its XRP, worth $9.3 million, following news of the SEC's lawsuit. “The Fund liquidated its position and reinvested the proceeds in other portfolio assets,"" Bitwise wrote to clients.    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are down Wednesday. Bitcoin is the index's only asset with a positive 24-hour return as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), reporting a gain of 0.4%.

42433433,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQp1h,1608756010,FinCEN’s Proposed Crypto Wallet Rule Might Hit DeFi,"A proposal by the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that would require crypto exchanges to collect personal information, including names and home addresses, from individuals seeking to transfer cryptocurrencies into their own wallets is poorly defined and could have widespread repercussions, say a number of regulatory experts.      The proposed rule, unveiled last Friday, would require crypto exchanges to collect this personal information from customers who transfer an aggregate of $3,000 per day to “unhosted” wallets (which are also referred to by FinCEN as self-hosted or self-custodied wallets; crypto users may know them as private wallets or, simply, wallets). Transfers of over $10,000 per day would require the exchange to file a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) to FinCEN, reporting these transactions and the individuals making them to the federal government.      The proposed rulemaking, which was published in the Federal Register on Dec. 23, has quickly drawn widespread industry backlash, with complaints ranging from the document’s poorly defined terms to the rushed process itself. Comments are due by Jan. 4, cutting what would normally be a months-long public comment period to just two weeks.      The controversial rule is said to be a personal project of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, said Jeremy Allaire, CEO of USDC stablecoin co-issuer Circle. It originally was thought to be far more stringent than the final version published last week.      Further, it appears the rule is being jammed through the rulemaking process to ensure it is implemented before President-elect Joe Biden takes office next month, said Nick Neuman, CEO of bitcoin self-storage firm Casa.      The shortened comment period reduces how much time exchanges have to determine whether they need to change their internal processes to remain in compliance, said Amy Davine Kim, chief policy officer of the Chamber of Digital Commerce advocacy group. How exchanges would comply also remains an open question, she said.      “It could also cause these regulated financial institutions to pause transactions involving self-hosted wallets given the extremely short timeframe in which to consider the implications of this rule, while they implement the tools, processes and procedures to implement the requirements,” Kim said.    Vaguely defined    Several key details of the proposed rulemaking have been poorly defined, multiple individuals told CoinDesk.      Perhaps the most glaring omission: “unhosted wallets,” FinCEN’s favored term for storing one’s own crypto, isn’t actually defined in the proposed rule, both Kim and Seward & Kissel Associate Andrew Jacobson said.      “Notably, the preface of the NPRM [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking] explicitly discusses ‘unhosted wallets’ as prompting the need for the proposed rule. However, the actual language of the proposed rule does not mention unhosted wallets or define it, making the rule discordant in its explanatory language versus the actual language of the rule,” Kim said.      Jacobson agreed, telling CoinDesk that while there are “pages and pages of explanation and justification” explaining the regulation and discussing unhosted wallets, the proposed regulation doesn’t actually specify what unhosted wallets are. A review of the document by CoinDesk confirms this.      Read more: US Floats Long-Dreaded Plan to Make Crypto Exchanges Identify Personal Wallets      The actual reporting requirements are also unclear, Allaire said. While names and addresses must be recorded and submitted, the proposed rulemaking doesn’t specify if IP or blockchain addresses are also required.      Nor does the proposed rulemaking say if financial institutions must collect this information from counterparties, or if the customers can just submit this information, Kim said.      “Finally, how would the rule treat the CTR aggregation requirements for customers that use multiple wallets? The CTR requirement attaches to the customer, not the wallet,” she said.    ‘Breaking’ DeFi    The rule itself is unlikely to impact end users, said Neuman. While there were initially rumors that Treasury’s proposed rulemaking would be far more stringent – potentially going so far as to ban unhosted wallets outright – this would have been far more difficult to implement.      “What isn’t clear is how the regulated service providers like exchanges will be actually implementing this,” he said. “There’s going to be compliance necessary if the rule passes among exchanges, brokers, other custodians, they’re going to have to implement this in one way or another and how they implement this will be important to what the user experience is like.”      Exchanges might need to whitelist individual wallet addresses to ensure funds aren’t sent to a wallet without the required personal information, he said.      One area that does seem likely to be impacted is decentralized finance (DeFi). Multiple people told CoinDesk the proposed rule’s biggest – and most unclear – impact would be on DeFi projects.      For one thing, many DeFi projects rely on smart contracts to store or escrow funds. Users engage with, say, Compound by connecting their MetaMask wallet to the lending platform. Subsequent transactions are reflected in the wallet itself, and unique to the user’s holdings.      Plus, these smart contract-powered platforms don’t have physical addresses, nor are they necessarily operating under the auspices of an actual company. In short, Uniswap would persist if Uniswap’s founders were arrested.      It is unclear how such DeFi platforms would be treated under FinCEN’s proposed rule.      “Since smart contracts do not have a name or physical address, they may be unable to interact with the U.S. financial system,” Kim said.      Read more: Coinbase CEO: Trump Administration May ‘Rush Out’ Burdensome Crypto Wallet Rules      Also, smart contracts don’t necessarily have counterparties, Allaire said. If a business is trying to send a large payment independently using crypto, it would need the counterparties’ names and addresses. Institutional investors providing liquidity to a DeFi platform would presumably not be covered by such rules.      This could throw an entire segment of the blockchain industry into a legal gray area, the Digital Chamber’s Kim said.      “Treasury should not impose a rule that could have a deleterious impact on this promising area of development without understanding the benefits to innovation,” she said.      “What if you want to send to the Compound protocol? There is no name and address, it’s a market,” Allaire said. “It could create a situation where the only way to use DeFi protocols is to be outside the U.S.”      This could even affect the Eth 2.0 staking contract, he said. To stake on the next iteration of the Ethereum blockchain, users must send 32 ETH to the smart contract, or about $20,000 – well over FinCEN’s limits.      “The vagueness of the rule also calls into question whether funds that were used in DeFi would or could be accepted if a user attempted to move those funds to a ‘hosted’ wallet,” Kim said.    Privacy concerns    Allaire noted the FinCEN rule raises new questions about privacy and how government regulators are approaching privacy concerns for digital cash. If exchanges are required to submit blockchain addresses, physical addresses and names to the agency, the federal government might be able to essentially track an individual’s digital activity.      This differs from how physical cash is treated, he said.      “When you walk out of a bank, they can report you did that but they can’t track you,” he said. “There’s a massive amount of personally identifiable information that’s about to start getting blasted around the world.”      Moreover, the rule could prove counterproductive to FinCEN’s actual mission of tracking malicious actors, Jacobson said. While the new reporting requirements might drive bad actors away from U.S. exchanges, it’s likely they’d just set up shop at an offshore platform.      “In some ways that isn’t a bad thing but could hurt FinCEN’s regulatory objectives because they won’t collect [that data],” he noted.

Kim noted the Customer Due Diligence Rule for banks took more than four years to implement, and saw an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking as well as extended conversations with the industry.      Advocacy groups and companies such as Coinbase have already begun preparing comment letters responding to FinCEN’s proposed rule.      Coin Center even set up a module to streamline the process for the general public to weigh in.      “If we don’t take the right approach the U.S. could end up significantly hamstrung versus other areas of the world in terms of development and innovation,” Casa’s Neuman said. “We definitely don’t want that to happen so it’s up to us to make sure.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMP | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/23/fincens-proposed-crypto-wallet-rule-might-hit-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/13d9dec7911dc9a200464103123a767215ed0f8a-2000x1334.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433437,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQpDh,1608748457,Camila Russo on Building The Defiant and the Future of DeFi,"Talk about good timing: In 2017, Camila Russo was on the prowl for a worthy book project. What would be a good subject? What hasn’t been covered?      At the time she was a reporter for Bloomberg. She was astonished to find a juggernaut of a story that was hiding in plain sight: Ethereum. “I was like, ‘I can’t believe that nobody is covering this,’” she says now. There were already crates of books written on Bitcoin, but there were very few, if any, on the world’s second-largest blockchain project.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond.    So she hunkered down. She did the research, she dove deep into the community, she turned herself into an expert and she wrote ""The Infinite Machine: How an Army of Crypto-hackers Is Building the Next Internet With Ethereum."" The book just so happened to have a publication date of July 14, 2020, smack in the middle of the explosive boom of decentralized finance (DeFi – still largely an Ethereum-based phenomenon).      Many book authors – lazier book authors (I count myself in this company) – would have simply thanked their good luck for the happy timing, soaked in the extra publicity, sold more books, perhaps taken a long vacation and then move on to the next book project.      Russo took a different path. While still finishing up her book, she realized that she had a unique perspective on the exploding world of DeFi. Suddenly she was an expert in the very thing that people were hungry to read. So she spent her days knocking out book edits and then her nights writing and launching her daily newsletter, The Defiant.      Fast forward one year. In a lightning-fast arc even by the standards of crypto, Russo has made the jump from reporter to influencer (even if she doesn’t use that word), and from book author to CEO. She hosts videos and podcasts. She headlines blockchain conferences – listed here, for example, just a handful of spots behind Vitalik Buterin and a few spots ahead of Binance Chairman CZ. “I’ve never been good at taking breaks,” she tells CoinDesk, giving us the behind-the-scenes story on launching The Defiant, sharing what it’s like to go from journalist to budding crypto star and making a few predictions about DeFi in 2021 and beyond.      Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.      What were some early challenges of launching The Defiant?      Russo: In the early days, and until pretty recently, I was still writing my book. The final two chapters weren't even written. And I had to go through all of the corrections, the back-and-forth with editors – you know how it is. I would write my book from 8 or 9:00 a.m. until 5, then I took an hour- or maybe a two-hour break, and then I wrote the next day’s newsletter until 11:00 p.m.      I’m exhausted just hearing that. What were your goals for The Defiant back then?      Russo: In the beginning, I thought it would be a side thing, and that my main job would be to become an independent freelance writer. That was my initial plan when I left Bloomberg. I started with the goal of writing a daily DeFi newsletter, but I didn't think it would be that much work. I thought it would be just a “quick summary of the news.""      What changed?      Russo: I found myself thinking that, well, I didn't want to write something that was of bad quality. And I wanted to explain what was going on. DeFi is really difficult, so I wanted my newsletter to provide more explanation, more value and a little bit more analysis. So the issues started getting longer and longer and taking more effort and time. But I also saw The Defiant growing quickly and getting great feedback. So it was hard to stop.      I didn't want to let people down. And I was having fun doing it, even though it was exhausting. I was like, Okay, I'm on to something here. Covering the space every day, it was so clear to me that this was going to be big, given the amount of innovation and activity. I thought, I need to stick to this.      When you started, what were some of your inspirations for the newsletter’s form or content or tone – that kind of thing?      Russo: The person who first encouraged me to do a newsletter was Anthony Pompliano. He interviewed me for his podcast and we began talking. I told him I had this idea of doing a DeFi newsletter. And he really encouraged me, he pointed me to Substack.      So I started following his newsletter much more closely as I was getting ready to launch The Defiant. I took a lot of inspiration from him on how he provides analysis on the market and how he has the free version and the paid version and how he has established a closer relationship with his paid subscribers.      Any other influences?      Russo: For a long time I’ve subscribed to The Information. They’re doing a really great job with their newsletter. And they inspired me to realize that a newsletter can be high-quality journalism. You can have high standards, and it's not necessarily like a personal blog all the time, you know?      100%. Since then, you’ve obviously grown a ton. What were some of the key inflection points?      Russo: It's been pretty gradual, organic growth since the beginning. I was writing about different projects and people, and the people I was writing about started sharing. And I had some really good fans early on. Linda Xie from Scalar Capital has been super supportive, recommending the newsletter. A16z has a crypto resources guide, and The Defiant is included. So I started getting shout-outs from these big, respected investors in the space.      Also, your timing didn’t hurt.      Russo: The curve of subscribers shot up during ""DeFi Summer."" It was really exciting. One thing I learned is that, yeah, my newsletter is still very much tied to the market.      See also: Camila Russo – Ethereum Is Building the Internet of Value      When did you start to expand The Defiant, in terms of adding resources and writers?      Russo: The first step was realizing that people were willing to pay for the content. Late last year, I started taking paid subscriptions and it was just incredible to see that people were subscribing. It's weird because at first, I was scared to kind of be on my own. I always had the Bloomberg brand to back me up.      And suddenly you’re just you.      Russo: And people were still wanting to pay for that, so that was incredible to see. [Laughs.] And then earlier this year, I was getting requests to sponsor the newsletter. At that point I decided to take sponsors and it started to feel more like a business. And I just didn't have the time to do it all on my own, so it made sense to take on contributors. I reached out to a couple of writers I liked, and that’s how it started.      What’s your pool of contributors like now?      Russo: Cooper Turley is the writer who’s writing most frequently, and I have four others who write every couple of weeks or so. There's someone who helps me edit the podcast. And I partner with Robin Schmidt to make the YouTube content.      Do you have a biz-dev person? Who does things like, ‘Okay, now I’m going to optimize sponsorships?”      Russo: No. So far, that's kind of been my job to manage all of the different sponsors and handle all of those inbound emails and stuff. It's been really interesting. All of my previous experience was as a journalist, but now I'm still that, plus sort of a CEO – overseeing a team of almost 10 people. And I’m managing all these decisions with sponsors, pricing and the newsletter. It's been fun.      It seems like there’s an interesting parallel here, to the many folks in the crypto space who started as coders or devs or whatever and then they’re like, “Holy s**t, now I’m the head of a $20 million project!” Do you feel any new kinship with the heads of these crypto startups?      Russo: Definitely. I can definitely put myself in the founder's shoes a lot better now. For example, when I’m covering something that goes wrong, I can be a lot more empathetic. Like, I know how it is. You have so much on your plate, and you’re trying to control so many different things at the same time. As a startup, it’s all on you. You’re handling everything.      When did it hit you that you’ve gone from being someone who reports on the space to someone who can actually have an influence on the space?      Russo: I’m not sure of the exact story or the date, but I remember seeing some smaller crypto web sites report on these things that I had said, or something I had tweeted. That was pretty weird. I didn't expect it. I was like, “That had never happened at Bloomberg.” Because when you're at Bloomberg, you're one more Bloomberg journalist. It started to sink in that people were citing me by my name. Before I was a “former Bloomberg journalist,” and now I’m either “The author of ‘The Infinite Machine” or “The founder of The Defiant.”      See also: Sale of the Century: The Inside Story of Ethereum’s 2014 Premine      Congrats, by the way.      Russo: Thank you.      I'm fascinated by how you keep all the balls spinning in the air. Can you walk through your typical day?      Russo: This has been changing throughout the year, but right now the first thing I do is edit stories that my contributors have sent me overnight. My main contributor, Cooper, just moved to the West Coast, so I get them at night and edit them in the early morning.      When do you start?      Russo: The first thing I do is take out my dog, who you’ve probably heard. [Note: Her dog, Conga, has been barking periodically throughout our conversation.] She’s our alarm clock and starts barking between 6:30 and 7:00 [a.m.]. I try to be sitting at my desk by 8 or 8:30 and then I start editing. I’m also writing stories.      How much of the newsletter do you still write?      Russo: Depending on the day, between 50% to 60%. And then the contributors in my time zone send me stories in the morning. I edit those. And while I’m juggling that I’m answering urgent emails. So I’m doing that all morning: editing, writing, answering urgent emails. Then I finally push out the newsletter between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. One of my goals for next year is to standardize the process, and get the newsletter out every day at 8 a.m.      And your afternoon?      Russo: That’s where I schedule most of my calls. I'll either record an interview for my podcast, or record something for the YouTube channel, or talk with potential sponsors, or talk with sources, or take calls on sponsorship, or do podcast interviews for other people's podcasts. I’m trying to do less and less of those.      Well, I’m honored you took this call.      [Both laugh.]      Russo: This was special. This was a special case. [Laughs again.]      Do you work on weekends?      Russo: I do work a little bit. I put out a weekly recap on Sundays. My goal is to have it scheduled on Friday, but I haven’t been able to organize myself to do that so I end up doing it, always, on Sunday morning. But recently I’ve had my Saturdays off.      What do you do for fun? I mean, to the extent that we can have fun in the pandemic?      Russo: My dog [Conga] is a big part of my life. My husband and I moved to Brooklyn [N.Y.] this year, and we got Conga just as the pandemic started. So on the weekends we take really long walks in Brooklyn, or we go to the park. Also I’m a big nerd and I love to read.    There will come a point where DeFi will seem like a really antiquated term, and that it’s just part of life    Cool, what are you reading now?      Russo: ""The Mandibles"" by Lionel Shriver, It’s really good. It’s not sci-fi but it’s set in 2029, and it’s all about how the U.S. has declined and the dollar is losing its power. But it seems very suitable for the bitcoiner audience. [Laughs.] And then I really loved ""The Nix."" It’s this big story about a dysfunctional family and they bring a lot of Norwegian folk stories into it.      Predictions for DeFi in 2021?      Russo: For the general trend, obviously DeFi will continue growing. And for next year, the biggest pieces that still need to gain steam are under collateralized loans. So far, DeFi has been very much based on collateral, and I think that's made adoption difficult. Or it’s made it a very niche thing because you need capital to start using it. So hopefully next year will be the year where under-collateralized loans start picking up. And I think the key to that will be different identity solutions, or decentralized credit cards. Those two developments will be key for DeFi to continue to grow.      How about in the next five years?      Russo: I think DeFi will continue to grow really quickly, and it’s bound to start merging, more and more, with fintech. Right now, fintech and DeFi are like two separate worlds. But that really makes no sense. I think the next step will be for companies to start building bridges between DeFi and fintech. And that will be the way that DeFi starts going mainstream and becoming just finance. There will come a point where “DeFi” will seem like a really antiquated term, and that it’s just part of life, sort of like finance – just how you deal with money.      It's almost like the “De” in DeFi might become silent.      Russo: Definitely, yeah.      This has been fun. Thanks for playing ball.

Announced Wednesday, a $175,000 donation to the Washington, D.C.-based non-profit was made by five industry players: NEAR Foundation, Celo Foundation, The Graph, Interchain Foundation and Solana.      Coin Center has also raked in over $300,000 this month from a bevy of small and large donors via Gitcoin, a public Ethereum-based fundraising platform. In the first two days of its Gitcoin program, Coin Center raised over $100,000, as CoinDesk reported.      In total, over 335 donors have contributed $290,000 with an additional $21,000 paid out by Gitcoin's unique donation-matching features.      Industry players have shown strong support for Coin Center's advisory and advocacy work in the U.S. capital amid a flurry of year-end legislative and regulatory efforts, including an anti-stablecoin bill that would require issuers to obtain bank charters and stricter know-your-customer (KYC) requirements per a proposed rule from the Treasury Department.      ""The Coin Center team has been working tirelessly over the years to help educate and and advocate for better U.S. policy around crypto,"" Ashley Tyson, special projects lead at NEAR Foundation, told CoinDesk in a direct message. ""As builders of this technology, we think it's important to come together and support their work.""      Coin Center's annual budget is a bit more than $1 million, per communications director Neeraj Agrawal.

The Commission announced Wednesday that it would let crypto-focused broker-dealers operate for five years without fear of an enforcement action provided they can verify they have possession and control of customers’ digital asset securities. The SEC is looking for feedback on the proposal, which comes after months of industry requests for clarity around the issue.      “As discussed below, the Commission’s position in this statement is premised on a broker-dealer limiting its business to digital asset securities to isolate risk and having policies and procedures to, among other things, assess a given digital asset security’s distributed ledger technology and protect the private keys necessary to transfer the digital asset security,” the SEC said in its published statement.      The SEC announcement was generally welcomed as a step in the right direction by industry players.      “This is positive from the SEC because it’s enabling rather than restrictive,” tweeted Caitlin Long, CEO of Wyoming-based crypto bank Avanti Financial.      Stepping back, the SEC has been accused of stonewalling efforts by digital asset custodians to become regulated federal broker-dealers. Securing a broker-dealer registration would let these companies offer securities for trading in the U.S., including security tokens.      A handful of startups already offer such services.      Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said it was “potentially very good news” for broker-dealers operating in the security token space, including his firm. He told CoinDesk that ""lack of broker-dealer custody has been a major point of stagnation"" for crpyto securities.      Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, told CoinDesk that her organization ""applauds the SEC for releasing a long-awaited path forward for broker-dealer custody of digital asset securities. Regulatory certainty on this issue will enable the custody marketplace to develop and give consumers the confidence they need that their digital assets are safe and secure.""      U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry, ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee, said he was pleased by the SEC's action in a statement.      ""Digital asset custody is a major outstanding regulatory issue, and I appreciate that the SEC is taking steps to allow for further market developments. I look forward to continuing to work with the Commission and market participants to allow further growth in this space,"" he said.    Broker-dealer saga    The SEC, alongside the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which works with the SEC but is actually tasked with approving broker-dealer applications, said last year that there are questions about whether digital asset custodians can effectively comply with the Customer Protection Rule, a part of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that requires broker-dealers “to promptly obtain and thereafter maintain physical possession or control of all fully-paid and excess margin securities it carries for the account of customers.      On Wednesday, the SEC said it wants public feedback on how companies can effectively comply. However, “as an interim step,” it’s creating what amounts to a five-year safe harbor, letting companies provide broker-dealer services under a set of specific conditions.      The SEC also said its five-year period will give the agency a chance to better understand how it can regulate the space.      According to its press release, the SEC wants public feedback. The statement will be published in the Federal Register and takes effect 60 days after that.

42433434,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQp7h,1608738313,Bitwise Liquidates XRP Position in Crypto Index Fund Following SEC Suit Against Ripple,"Crypto money manager Bitwise has liquidated $9.3 million worth of XRP in its crypto index fund.      The firm acted shortly after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the token’s alleged creator, Ripple Labs Inc., for conducting an unregistered and ongoing securities offering.      “Prior to the sale of the asset on December 22, 2020, XRP was approximately 3.8% of the Fund,” the firm wrote. “The Fund liquidated its position and reinvested the proceeds in other portfolio assets.”      The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund is largely denominated in bitcoin and ether. The funds from its liquidated XRP position have been reinvested into the other assets in the fund, according to a company press release. The fund also holds litecoin, bitcoin cash, LINK, ADA, XLM, EOS and tezos.      “The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund does not invest in assets that are reasonably likely to be deemed securities under federal or state securities laws,” the company wrote. “Bitwise’s decision to liquidate its position in XRP was based on consideration of new public information from the SEC’s complaint.”      Read more: SEC Sues Ripple Over 7-Year, $1.3B ‘Ongoing’ XRP Sale      While there is no fund linked to the Bitwise 100 Total Market Crypto Index, which is maintained for academic and research purposes, XRP will be removed from that index at 4 p.m. ET today, Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer, told CoinDesk. The Bitwise 100 combines the holdings of the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index, the Bitwise 20 Mid Cap Crypto Index and the Bitwise 70 Small Cap Crypto Index, he explained.      Digital asset manager Grayscale Investments did not respond to a request for comment by press time.    The New York-based company, which is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group, currently offers investors an XRP Trust, which is modeled after the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Since its inception, the XRP trust has decreased in value by more than 80%, according to a July 2020 reporthttps://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/XRP-Trust-Fact-Sheet-July-2020.pdf.    The vehicles from both Bitwise and Grayscale are meant for accredited investors only and provide access to crypto price gains without having to hold the underlying assets.    Banks hold tight    While Bitwise was fast to change course, major Japanese financial group SBI Holdings told CoinDesk the SEC lawsuit doesn’t yet affect its partnership with Ripple.      “As far as we have heard, the lawsuit is currently in the process of being filed and no injunction has been issued against Ripple for the sale of XRP or the provision of [On-Demand Liquidity] and other products, and the company is continuing its business as usual and pushing forward with the expansion of RippleNet,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement sent Wednesday. “Under these circumstances, SBI Holdings will continue to be a strong partner of Ripple as we work together to expand our business in Asia.”      Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service allows companies to transfer funds from one currency to XRP and from XRP to another currency. The cross-border payment tool allows enterprises to avoid opening bank accounts in countries they want to send funds to.      Earlier this year, Ripple and SBI holdings announced that Ripple planned to invest in MoneyTap, a blockchain money-transfer app launched through a joint venture between SBI and Ripple called Ripple Asia. In January of this year, SBI announced it would give shareholders the option to receive XRP as a benefit.      A spokesperson for U.S. regional bank PNC said it would be “premature” for the bank to comment on its use of Ripple’s technology since it takes advantage of xCurrent, the distributed ledger technology that does not use XRP. PNC’s treasury management division uses xCurrent to exchange messages between bankers and clients.      Spanish bank Santander, global trade-finance bank Euro Exim Bank, London-based Barclays and Japan’s MUFG Bank declined to comment.      Eleven other financial institutions known to be linked with Ripple’s suite of services have yet to reply to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.

42433436,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQpBh,1608737646,"Why I'm Long Crypto, Short DLT","I had a remarkably good year as an industry analyst – a term I prefer to “expert.” Almost no one in crypto is an expert, to be fair. So many things change every month.      Last October, after the end of a rather enjoyable and intense journey with ConsenSys, where I spent most of my time talking Ethereum to financial institutions, it was painfully obvious to me the future of blockchain technology wasn’t in private permissioned ledgers. On the positive side, it was also very clear the institutional fear and resistance to public permissionless networks and crypto was starting to fall apart. So I took a sharp left turn from so-called enterprise blockchain into crypto and ended up doing some very useful work on contract with crypto startups like CDG, and then Binance and Paxful – two of the world’s largest crypto firms.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Ajit Tripathi, a CoinDesk columnist, is the crypto co-host of the Breaking Banks Europe podcast. Previously, he served as a fintech partner at ConsenSys and was a co-founder of PwC’s U.K. Blockchain Practice.    It was a good call. Being at the intersection of “tradfi” and crypto and having worked deeply in both spaces has given me a rare perspective on the dialectic between the twin forces of cypherpunk revolution and Wall Street’s resistance. I will tell this story of megatrends with links to my articles that have proven particularly prescient this year and will likely stand the test of 2021 as well.    Long open internet, short consortium    Just before bitcoin and ethereum started a very sharp rise, I wrote an article challenging Chris Skinner, a close friend who is one of the world’s foremost fintech experts. I argued that even though crypto was still fringe, this fringe was now big enough to start a snowball. Chris and I eventually agreed this blockchain wasn’t the same “private DLT” that consultants (like me once) were pushing on banks and enterprise clients but a compelling technology and actual source of technological innovation in the internet. [FYI, if Chris calls something in fintech, that thing usually happens.]    Long India, short crypto ban    After ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin’s famous “one million devs” talk at last year’s Ethereum developer conference, I had tweet–asked how Ethereum would get to one million devs without India, which is one of the world’s largest pools of developers in any area of technology.      It turns out when all of us in the West were all worrying about India’s crypto ban, developers and entrepreneurs in India were building some really cool pieces of crypto technology exemplified by projects like Matic Network, Marlin Protocol, Instadapp and Razor Network (Disclosure: I have a small investment in Razor and Marlin and I hold a small amount of Matic). Meanwhile some of the best investors in the space including Arjun Balaji of Paradigm, Avichal Garg of Electric Capital and Binance Chairman Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao had started investing in India's crypto ecosystem and bitcoin buyers had started popping up on peer-to-peer bitcoin platforms like Paxful.      This is why, in my CoinDesk article, I declared India’s Supreme Court decision to unwind the crypto ban a victory for the entire crypto ecosystem. As of today, if you are a crypto investor,and you are not investing in India, you are going to live to regret it.    Long Polkadot, short 'eth killers'    (Full disclosure: Most of my crypto net worth [otherwise known as bags] is in ethereum, I am a small time Eth 2.0 staker and I don’t hold much Polkadot or Kusama at all – yet.]      In a popular YouTube interview with SwissBorgs Alex Fazel this year, I bravely declared Polkadot the likely Ethereum disruptor as of today. I argued that not only had Gavin Wood contributed seminal ideas to Ethereum 2.0, he had also witnessed firsthand how the Ethereum developer community was built and in my humble opinion, “he knew exactly what he’s doing.”      See also: Ajit Tripathi - Banks Need to Adopt Crypto, Now      At the risk of upsetting my fellow Ethereum old-timers, I think of Polkadot as Eth 2.0 without the technical debt and much more clarity in terms of vision and technical roadmap. If you ask dapp developers today, what Polkadot is missing is the rich set of developer tools that ConsenSys built to power the Ethereum ecosystem. In a sense, Polkadot is missing its own ConsenSys – a venture studio to invest in developer tools and infrastructure. This hasn’t stopped Polkadot from becoming the second most popular blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi) already and, if Polkadot finds its own portfolio of powerful dev tools, it’s going to be a very close contest.      Conversely, Ethereum can sustain its lead by taking occasional steps back from open-ended research and providing more architectural clarity to its core constituency – dapp and DeFi developers sooner rather than later. The Ethereum Foundation is doing really well by encouraging innovation in layer 2 protocols to enable optimisations for different non functional parameters. Layer 2 protocols, a leading-edge developer toolset and network effects could preserve Ethereum’s lead, but it’s far from a done deal right now.    Long parachains, short prop chains    It amazes me that some of the biggest winners in crypto still don’t want to get the joke about the internet. Without naming any particular countries, entities or individuals, there’s no end to really smart, wealthy and powerful people trying to launch their own blockchains, their own stacks, their own smart contracting languages and thus their own vertically integrated crypto ecosystems they can own and control. Essentially, too many champions of crypto want to be the epicenter of decentralization. It’s only funny because it’s true.      These are smart people, and in an unregulated, short-termist environment, historically, it’s been possible to launch your own vertically integrated crypto ecosystems extremely profitably. Further, as Vitalik famously described in his ""trilemma,"" every blockchain ends up being optimized for one set of problems at the expense of another. This has led to building simple distributed ledgers to improve transaction throughput (Ripple), CS professors building throughput–optimized chains (Avalanche and Algorand), engineers building complex compute scalable chains (Solana), centralized notaries to provide transaction data sharing (Corda). The latter problem of “one size does not fit all” is something Polkadot will look to solve with Parachains and Ethereum 2.0 will look to solve with sharding and (maybe) sidechains.    Too many champions of crypto want to be the epicenter of decentralization. It’s only funny because it’s true.    The history of the internet does not repeat but it rhymes. At some point, I don’t foresee a chaotic multi–blockchain world. I see a “parachain” and “mainnet” world – blockchains built on a shared set of standards and rules, no matter what it’s called, will interconnect. The internet of value will be built on organized chaos and proprietary “my blockchain is better than yours” architectures such as enterprise DLTs and Hedera Hashgraph will fall away for lack of connectivity and developer adoption.    Long correlation, short diversification    My day job at Binance involved building fiat on-ramps – something for which my training with banks and PwC made me a particularly good fit. This gave me an insider’s view of how rapidly the attitudes of mainstream (fiat) fintech were changing. In 2017, I had witnessed U.K. ""high street"" banks refuse bank accounts for Coinbase firsthand (which they certainly regret), and in 2020 electronic money institutions and banks were suddenly quite keen to work with all the major crypto exchanges.      This pleasant surprise led me to write a series of articles describing how COVID-19 was changing regulators’ attitudes towards crypto, how the fiat and crypto worlds were starting to converge, why this convergence of fiat and crypto will be good for crypto in the short run but prove to be a mixed blessing in the long run, why central banks need to shed fear and launch retail central bank digital currencies and, last but not the least, why banks needed to adopt crypto now to remain competitive in a world of digital money and intelligent wallets.    Long Satoshi, short Saylor    As of today, if you are a senior executive at a bank, hedge fund or asset manager and you do not have a crypto strategy, you are making your board very unhappy indeed. A worrying inference I haven’t mentioned before is that the entry of funds and corporate treasuries will increase its correlation with other risks on assets like equities, eliminating one of bitcoin’s biggest value propositions for institutions – diversification.      Bitcoin, like Apple, is a multi-hundred-billion dollar brand but as professor Scott Galloway argues in his brilliant book “Post Corona,” we live in the age of products where the product has to live up to the narrative of the brand. The narrative around bitcoin has shifted nearly every year with the digital gold narrative finally sticking with the likes of Michael Saylor and Jack Dorsey, in part due to the relentless money printing by Western governments.      See also: Ajit Tripathi - Bitcoin Is Good for PayPal, but Is PayPal Good for Bitcoin?      At some point, the novelty value of crypto assets for PayPal and CashApp customers will wear off, the bear market will set in, average consumers will lose money and CashApp’s customer engagement numbers driven by bitcoin will drop as it has with Tinder, Facebook, Instagram and everything else that’s new and gamified.      The only way Dorsey can fulfil his vision for bitcoin is by investing in the technology that shifts the “GODL” narrative back to Satoshi’s original “P2P internet cash” narrative. The world needs internet money that facilitates censorship-resistant instant cross-border consumer payments. It does not need digital gold or gamified money if it’s a commodity cornered by a few early institutional whales or if it becomes more and more correlated with the stock market over time.    Long dapps, short fat protocols    Historically, the crypto playbook has been to compete with bitcoin and print undifferentiated ""Burning Man"" money. This is done by launching your own blockchain with protocol tokens, making the number go up with marketing, supply management, community building and building a loyal following of consumers who couldn’t care less about the technology or utility.      This is also partly because dapps weren’t really that useful until now. DeFi dapps like Aave and Uniswap have changed all that. These dapps are now extremely useful for the crypto aware, with monthly average users and volumes climbing continuously. Crypto is not just coins, marketing and fat protocols anymore. Further, so far there hasn’t really been a Web3 real economy, but it is now starting to come online with non–fungible token and gaming token marketplaces like Gemini’s Nifty Gateway.      This sharp increase in utility of dapps is a tipping point and a small preview of the future that lies ahead. The next bull run will not belong to bitcoin or fat protocols. As blockchains start to converge towards a “parachain” or “sharded” future, the next bull run in 2025 will belong to decentralized applications and it will be at the dot.com scale. I wrote about this in my substack, “Why you should pay attention to DeFi.""      I hope when I retire all these blogs and articles will feature in a nice historical chronicle of Web3. If no one else wants to print them in a book form, maybe I will pay a few ETH or DOT to print them and buy all the copies :–).

In traditional markets, European stocks rose as trade and transport connections reopened with the U.K., and U.S. stock futures were higher after President Donald Trump demanded that relief checks stipulated in the just-passed $900B coronavirus aid bill be increased to $2,000 from $600. Gold strengthened 0.2% to $1,864 an ounce.      (Editor's note: This issue of First Mover will be our last for 2020. We are taking a much-needed break, resuming Monday, Jan. 4. Please allow us this opportunity to thank you, our subscribers, for coming along during a year full of all sorts of unexpected twists. From our perspective, 2020 will in hindsight prove a pivotal year in the development and growth of the crypto industry and digital-asset markets, and more broadly, in monetary history. We are grateful that you have trusted us to help keep you informed. Happy holidays to all, and best wishes in 2021.)    Market Moves    It's a case of sell the rumor, sell the fact.      A day after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse warned that his company might be sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator followed through, accusing the company of violating federal laws in its $1.3 billion of sales of the XRP payments token over a seven-year period.      Prices for XRP, which had fallen for three straight days amid speculation that an SEC action was imminent, tumbled 13% on Tuesday as the suit was unveiled, and then more than 20% Wednesday as the potential fallout from the case became clearer.      The decline pushed the token's price to the lowest in a month, shaving its year-to-date gain to 67%. While that performance may sound impressive to U.S. stock traders who have seen the Standard & Poor's 500 Index climb 14% in 2020, it pales in comparison to bitcoin's 227% year-to-date increase and ether's 384%.      Executives with San Francisco-based Ripple, which runs a payments network, had long maintained that XRP was separate from the company, even though the token was often referred to as “ripple” through early 2018 and shared a logo until later that year, as reported by CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De.      The token's status under U.S. securities law has been a subject of debate for several years, with former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo saying at one point that in his view, XRP should be “considered a currency or a medium of exchange,” not a security.      The SEC didn't see it that way: “At all relevant times during the offering, XRP was an investment contract and therefore a security subject to the registration requirements of the federal securities laws,” according to the lawsuit.      CoinDesk's Muyao Shen reported that the market for XRP could quickly dry up because cryptocurrency exchanges that serve as a primary venue for purchases and sales might choose to delist the token rather than risk being designated as unregistered securities exchanges.      ""That immediate disappearance of a massive portion of market liquidity and participants would cause the asset to dump heavily in price,"" John Willock, CEO of Tritum, a diversified crypto services provider, told Shen.      MoneyGram, a publicly traded money-transfer company that gets fees from Ripple to use an ""on-demand liquidity platform"" as well as XRP, said in an emailed statement that it would ""monitor the situation.""      But OSL, the first regulated digital-asset trading and brokerage platform in Hong Kong, wasn't so patient: Early Wednesday, the company announced plans to suspend trading in XRP.

But for the sake of posterity, and to confer bragging rights, First Mover decided to publish the latest ranking of year-to-date returns for digital assets in the CoinDesk 20, as it stands with just eight days to go in 2020.      The best-performing asset in the group was chainlink (LINK), whose token price jumped sevenfold this year.      Chainlink benefited from the frenzy of speculation over the future of decentralized finance, a subsector of the cryptocurrency industry known as DeFi, where entrepreneurs are building semi-automated trading and lending systems atop blockchain networks, primarily Ethereum.      ""Investors that put capital to work in this thematic sector of digital assets generally outperformed bitcoin and the digital-asset market beta in 2020,"" according to a report this month by the digital-asset manager Vision Hill.      Of course, one really only had to be in the digital-asset markets, and stay in, to make money this year. Returns were positive for all but one of the CoinDesk 20 members.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    (Editor's Note: CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole, who writes Bitcoin Watch, is off this week.)

42433424,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQoph,1608735391,Nasdaq-Listed Canadian Firm to Invest Over $1M in Bitcoin,"Mogo, a Canadian fintech listed on the Nasdaq and Toronto stock exchanges, has announced it will invest in bitcoin.    The firm said Wednesday that it plans to make a corporate investment of up to CA$1.5 million (US$1.16 million) in bitcoin, and will consider additional purchases over 2021.  The funds come from its CA$17 million (US$13.2 million) investment portfolio, Mogo indicated.  The initial investment represents around 1.5% of the company's total assets as of the end of Q3 2020.  “We are strong believers in bitcoin as an asset class and believe this investment is consistent with our goal to make bitcoin investing available to all Canadians,” said Greg Feller, Mogo's president and CFO.  The news after a number of public companies have made corporate investments in bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market cap, seeking to hedge against a falling dollar and future inflation.  Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced Monday that it had made another bitcoin investment worth $650 million. The firm now has 70,470 BTC worth over $1.66 billion in its treasury reserve.  Jack Dorsey's Square put $50 million – 1% of its assets – into bitcoin in October.

42433421,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQojh,1608734833,Axie Infinity Launches Public Testnet of Ronin Sidechain to 'Scale Even Faster',"A Pokemon-inspired digital pet universe that has grown to be the most-played game on Ethereum is testing new ways to scale.      Announced Wednesday, Axie Infinity has launched the public testnet of its Ronin sidechain. The new sidechain will “give us room to breathe and scale even faster,” co-founder Jeffrey Zirlin said in an interview. “We’ve shown that we can grow quickly on Ethereum and we think that we can grow even faster on a sidechain.”      The non-fungible token (NFT) game has over 18,000 monthly active users, according to data site DappRadar.      “A Ronin was a samurai without a master in feudal Japan,” the firm wrote in a blog post. “Ronin represents our desire to take the destiny of our product into our own hands.”      CryptoKitties maker Dapper Labs faced a similar inflection point after launching on Ethereum and decided to build their own blockchain, Flow, in 2019.    Ubisoft involvement    Paris-based video game giant Ubisoft is Ronin’s inaugural validator.      “Validators are responsible for authoring and validating blocks, updating price oracles, and approving deposits and transfers of assets (ETH, ERC20, and ERC721) to and from Ronin,” Axie Infinity wrote. “Validators also control the addition and removal of other validators.”      Ubisoft has advised other popular blockchain games like fantasy football game Sorare and collectible trading card game Splinterlands.      “Blockchain gaming is like a special type of battery that can power different types of games,” Zirlin said, using electric-car maker Tesla as an analogy. “It’s been really helpful to have veterans [Ubisoft] to pass down their knowledge.”    Bug bounty    Along with the testnet release, Axie Infinity is also announcing a bug bounty program. Developers who flag critical issues in Ronin can earn rewards as high as $2,000.      The Ronin public testnet will run until Jan. 18, when Axie Infinity’s new land system and related items will migrate over from its current sidechain, Loom Network. (When CryptoWars left Loom earlier this year, we reported the sidechain seemed to be pivoting away from gaming altogether.)      Later on, Zirlin said, Axies on the Ethereum mainnet will move to Ronin as well.",POSITIVE,ETH,ASIA | AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/23/axie-infinity-launches-public-testnet-of-ronin-sidechain-to-scale-even-faster,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0543a2aa1a7793827e4f1e7f9a044b128f2fe6a-1339x821.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433435,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQp5h,1608734180,Pantera's Paul Veradittakit's 2021 Predictions,"It has been an eventful year, to say the least. In terms of blockchain and crypto, we saw several key developments: the halving of Bitcoin, liquidity mining and the explosive growth of several decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, stronger tools for blockchain interoperability and much more.      As 2021 begins and the globe slowly eases its way out of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated market fluctuations, I look forward to seeing even more growth in the innovation, widespread use and diverse impacts of blockchain technologies. The space is becoming simultaneously more complex and more accessible, broadening the horizons for what the crypto community can achieve in building decentralized, user-first financial systems.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Paul Veradittakit is a partner at Pantera Capital.  On last year’s predictions    Here is a review of my predictions from last year. Along with a summary of how that space or trend fared in 2020, I’ve included an accuracy rating to assess how well the prediction held up, with one being least accurate and five being most accurate.      See also: Pantera Partner Paul Veradittakit’s Crypto Predictions for 2020    We’re reaching some significant inflection points in areas from retail adoption, to nationalized digital currencies, to faster blockchain technologies  Diem (formerly Libra)/Novi (formerly Calibra)    Given Diem’s eventful (in the regulatory sense) public reveal in 2019, I expected 2020 to be an equally exciting year for Facebook’s project in terms of developing a reputation, fighting key regulatory battles and beginning to build up adoption. On the contrary, Diem’s launch was delayed and it stayed predominantly under the public radar throughout 2020.      In April, the association announced it would make key modifications to its architecture to address some of the main regulatory concerns brought against it. The governing association also renamed the project from Libra to Diem, and the wallet was renamed from Calibra to Novi. Most recently, key individuals in the initiative claimed that the platform could launch as early as January 2021. Even if Diem didn’t catch the public eye as much in 2020, it definitely made some key developments behind the scenes. Additionally, with the groundbreaking federal antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, the project is likely to get significantly more attention in the months ahead.    Bitcoin halving    Bitcoin’s halving from a block reward of 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC in May of this year certainly garnered a lot of widespread attention, but the exact effect of the halving event on the price of bitcoin is still ambiguous. There was a muted reaction to the halving event: A few days after, the price even dropped a little. Some experts proposed the halving had been “priced in” in the months leading up to it. In other words, because investors expected bitcoin’s price to appreciate the price naturally inflated before the halving event, making the exact change following the event less noticeable.      Even if not immediate, the halving certainly had a major effect on the long-term outlook for bitcoin and the macro narrative that has since dominated the dialogue with traditional investors on bitcoin’s potential.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained    Gaming    Unfortunately, in 2020 we didn’t see that many new developments in the blockchain space for gaming, and certainly not many public facing launches. Many game developers still face a great deal of technical friction in terms of building on chain, due to its complexity and often slow runtime. Still, the interest in the concept has not subsided. Many game creators are exploring how non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be used as valuable digital assets in games.      Several studios, including Pixelmatic, Ubisoft and Atari have all claimed that blockchain technologies could play important roles in their games in the future, and are beginning to actively explore the concept. As of today, one of the most promising and well-known blockchain games is The Sandbox, a game kind of like Minecraft where users can monetize digital assets via the blockchain. The Sandbox has already announced partnerships with major game developers including Atari and Square Enix.    DeFi growth    If nothing else, 2020 was the year of DeFi. One of the biggest trends of the year, undoubtedly, was liquidity mining. To keep it simple, liquidity mining is essentially where users supply their own assets as liquidity to a protocol in exchange for a protocol’s governance token. Over time, due to lots of interest, this governance token increases in value, often generating immense returns for liquidity-supplying users and incentivizing them to keep supporting the DeFi protocol. This year governance tokens for Compound, Balancer, Yearn.Finance and many more launched and exploded in value. Further, the value generated for these platforms’ liquidity suppliers was around 100%-200% APR.      In January, a grand total of $1 billion was locked into DeFi platforms collectively. In August, it peaked at US$15 billion. Interestingly, MakerDAO continues to be the platform with the most value locked in, though that first-place position was usurped several times over the year by Compound and other platforms. Users are beginning to reap the benefits of a decentralized, community-owned financial system. We’ll likely see this excitement and rapid growth continue through 2021.    Central bank currencies    The COVID-19 pandemic had, and is continuing to have, a massive economic impact on several of the world’s largest economies. It has also raised some serious doubt about the government’s competence and intentions in its economic policy and highlighted some key concerns and difficulties with the efficiency of our existing economic system. While we may have not seen any significant launches in central bank digital currencies (CBDC) in 2020, the space definitely saw a lot more interest as more governments, banks and research institutions explore how crypto can enhance our financial system.      China’s central bank is working on a digital currency pilot, which has seen over 4 million transactions and 2 billion yuan in gross volume. In October, several financial institutions including the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve collectively published a report outlining the key features necessary in a successful, feasible CBDC. The Federal Reserve also has been actively working towards the development of a digital dollar.      See also: Marcelo Prates – Central Banks Had to Up Their Money Game This Year – And They Did    Infrastructure and Web 3.0    This year saw the launches and announcements of several key infrastructural projects within the blockchain space that will enable a great diversity of decentralized applications in the future. One of the year’s largest was the public launch of the Alchemy API, which positions itself as the AWS of blockchain. It’s building infrastructure that makes it simple to manage and build on top of Ethereum nodes and currently powering $7.5 billion in on-chain transactions annually.      Other Web 3.0 infrastructure tools include the Keep protocol, which provides developers with off-chain storage for dapps; API3, which works with the API ecosystem to build blockchain-native oracles and bring the massive returns of DeFi and dapps to API providers; and the Oasis Protocol, which builds blockchain-enabled tools to help developers securely analyze data and guarantee user privacy. Given the generally growing interest in decentralized applications overall, I hope to see more developers take advantage of these technologies to reduce the complexity of building dapps and expanding their use cases.    Regulatory hurdles    In general, throughout 2020 we saw less public attention and debate on regulating crypto, likely because government financial institutions were likely focused on other areas (rightly so), due to the implications of the pandemic. However, several government agencies made key regulatory actions throughout 2020 that demonstrate how they are thinking more seriously about cryptocurrency and the role it plays in the modern American economy.      In 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged crypto firms roughly $40 million in penalties, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged crypto firms roughly $9 million in penalties, an all-time high for the latter. Most of these sanctions and penalties are targeted around initial coin offerings (ICOs) and gray areas around whether certain tokens should be deemed securities or commodities. Some of the most prominent developments from this year include the SEC’s proposed safe harbor for crypto entrepreneurs, the CFTC’s case against Abra for selling security-based swaps to investors without listing them on a recognized national exchange and the CFTC’s case against BitMex for offering illicit crypto services to their users.    Looking ahead    Here are seven areas where I expect to see lots of promising innovation and growth throughout 2021.    Bitcoin will continue to grow immensely in value and popularity, as the original flagship cryptocurrency.    Bitcoin started the year hovering at a price of $7,000 and climbed to fresh all-time highs above $23,000. Payment giants like PayPal and Square are making it easy for everyday users to purchase bitcoin and institutional investors are showing more interest than ever. Following a 90% growth in price in 2019 and a whopping 170% growth in price in 2020, I look forward to seeing bitcoin grow in value even more and become more widely used.    Governments will be exploring central bank digital currencies more seriously, and we may see a launch in 2021.    As mentioned above, several governments and cross-governmental agencies demonstrated a serious commitment to exploring how CBDCs can better support economies, via pilots and in-depth case studies. With the impending Diem launch and other projects like Celo rolling out more products and functionalities, it’s likely that stablecoins will generally gain more traction as a viable vehicle for money transfer, spurring even more governmental interest.      China’s pilot with the digital renminbi (DCEP) has gone exceedingly well, and availability is targeted to expand next year, maybe even faster than we expect. In Japan, 30 banks are already investigating a digital currency offering, and the country may even see a full public rollout in 2021 itself. The Bank of England also continues to investigate applications for CBDC in retail, and could begin pilots next year as well.    DeFi will continue to explode in value.    In 2020, we saw a ridiculous 15-fold increase in the value locked in DeFi protocols. Much of this growth was driven by the trend of liquidity mining, kick-started by some key players like Compound and Balancer, where protocols incentivized users to supply liquidity in exchange for governance tokens that appreciated quickly over time.      The community also saw a trend of developers forking existing protocols and platforms to build ones for more custom use cases or enhanced decentralization and privacy. Some key ones include Cream Finance, which is a fork of Compound and Swerve Finance, which is a fork of Curve. It’s more lucrative (and easier) than ever to set up a DeFi protocol, and I look forward to seeing more projects in this space and another whopping increase in the total value locked across all platforms. The incredible capitalization of these existing platforms could also set them up to support more unique functionalities, including larger loans, differentiated lending products and more.    Crypto will begin to see widespread mainstream adoption.    Even the harshest critics of cryptocurrency and digital currency are beginning to see the immense value that can be generated by these technologies. The explosive growth on DeFi protocols itself is too strong of an argument to reject. In Latin America and Southeast Asia, more and more people are using cryptocurrency to settle regular, everyday financial transactions. Additionally, as the community comes up with better primitives, tools and abstractions for building dapps, developers will be able to position these tools in more appealing ways to everyday consumers. Given the convergence of all these factors, 2021 could be the pivotal year for driving mainstream crypto adoption.    With widespread mainstream adoption, we’ll begin to see some more regulatory clarity, especially in retail use cases.    As crypto becomes more mainstream, it becomes a more important issue for regulatory agencies to focus on. The vast majority of crypto regulation thus far has been centered around distinguishing securities from commodities and ensuring that tokens follow appropriate guidelines per SEC and CFTC rules. Not as much work has been done on crypto as an everyday store of value, and how stablecoins and other digital currencies can be used for retail, compensation and more.      Governments are interested in how crypto transactions would affect taxes, especially demonstrated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service's inquiry into digital financial activities. Above all else, the growing interest in using cryptocurrency, not exclusively as a means for trading, lending or investing, but as a literal replacement to cash and credit in our everyday financial activities will necessitate much more regulatory work from key agencies in 2021.    2021 will see several crypto acquisitions, unicorns and even a possible IPO.    Coinbase looks set to go public in 2021. Along with Coinbase, several other prominent crypto companies have reached ""unicorn"" status, including Circle, Binance and Ripple. Additionally, crypto M&A continues to grow, with the average deal value of 2020 being $45.9 million, more than double of 2019’s average value of $19.2 million.      As more people become interested in the space and more crypto projects spin up, it’s only natural we’ll see a sharp hike in the amount of crypto business development via more acquisitions and more projects reaching unicorn status. Especially given the massive inflow of institutional capital as the world’s leading financial institutions become more curious about crypto, M&A and business development will play an even larger role in the 2021 crypto entrepreneurship scene.      See also: Coinbase, With Bitcoin Soaring, Files in Preparation for Landmark Public Offering    Private assets will slowly start to go digital.    Beyond the pure financial value that can be generated by decentralization and cryptocurrency, large financial institutions are also beginning to see significant potential in the underlying blockchain technologies and some key ways they could support existing financial systems. Traditional securities bookkeeping has a poor record of ownership, significant manual oversight for compliance and long/slow trading workflows. Digitizing bookkeeping using blockchain and cryptography could make things significantly cheaper and more secure.      Using cryptographically verifiable keys can provide a more trusted record of ownership, and digitization also naturally leads to faster workflows and more automations. Such a change is likely to be slow, because it challenges a longstanding paradigm within the financial industry, but it definitely generates a significant amount of value for the space and banks are beginning to keep their eye on it.    Final thoughts    2020 may have been the blackest of black swans but the crypto space saw some incredible developments, innovations and growth. As 2021 begins and the world begins its return to “normal,” the incumbent changes over the next few months will certainly have an effect on crypto interest and usage, both from blockchain developers and everyday users. Despite the inevitable challenges, however, I’m extremely hopeful for the space in 2021.      We’re reaching some significant inflection points in areas from retail adoption, to nationalized digital currencies, to faster blockchain technologies and these developments will hopefully power a brighter, more accessible and even more decentralized financial future in the years to come.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Paul Veradittakit,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/23/panteras-paul-veradittakits-2021-predictions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc30c8390aeaed267d9a6411c03cd964e31e8fd7-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm will build its customer relationship management (CRM) tools on the Polkadot network, according to a Wednesday announcement. Cere’s latest raise follows a $3.5 million seed round announced in August 2019.      Arrington XRP Capital, QCP Capital, Kinetic Capital, Monday Capital and AU21 Capital led the round, all of which participated in the last round.      Cere has allocated the funds for its enterprise-grade Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) platform pitched as an alternative to mainstream alternatives. The product will be available to all other applications built on Polkadot, the firm said.      “For years, the same major tech companies – including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce – have been holding consumer data hostage,” Cere CEO Fred Jin said in a statement. “The Cere DDC platform gives businesses back ownership of their data and allows them to quickly build up their own customer data ecosystems.”    See also: Salesforce Alternative Cere Raises $3.5 Million From Binance Labs, Others    Described as a “protocol for protocols,” Polkadot enables developers and projects to launch their own blockchains in a similar manner to how Ethereum enables users to issue their own tokens.      “We are excited to see Cere innovating along the same vision of interoperable ecosystems to foster the next generation of DeFi and blockchain adoption,” Dieter Fishbein, head of ecosystem development at Polkadot builder Web3 Foundation, said in a statement.      Polkadot is generally seen as a competitor to Ethereum and other blockchains built for decentralized applications (dapps). As of now, the general competition has mainly consisted of dapps hopping between different Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)–compatible blockchains, such as Compound Finance announcing plans to launch its own Compound Chain.

42385417,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1rMz,1608726600,"Valid Points: Forget Staking, There Are Still Coins to Be Mined on PoW Ethereum","‘Twas the penultimate night before Christmas, when all through the network, every machine was stirring, down to even the smallest Raspberry Pi.      While businesses, the stock markets and many restaurants will be closed for the holidays, Ethereum 2.0, like all other blockchain networks, will be humming along the same as any other day of year without interruption.      This has implications for validators, the main participants of Eth 2.0, who are responsible for keeping the network secure all year round, 24/7.      Luckily, most of the programming to keep the Eth 2.0 network online and active falls to validators who, in large part, simply have to ensure their internet connection is stable and their machines are connected to a steady source of electrical power.      The incentive for validators to do this work and ensure their operations are running smoothly, even through the holidays, is an average daily income of 0.0089 ETH, which is equivalent to $5.57 at time of writing.      Running an Eth 2.0 validator node may not be a full-time job, but it is a responsibility that requires participation 365 days of the year (or 366 if it’s a leap year) in order to maximize income.      Judging by the 15,600 or so validators who are queued up for entry into the network over the coming days, and the 99% participation rate of validators who are already admitted into Eth 2.0, it would seem for many the rewards do outweigh the responsibility.    New frontiers for Ethereum mining    A long-awaited highly efficient and powerful Ethereum mining machine first promised in 2018 is making its market debut three weeks after the launch of Eth 2.0’s Beacon Chain – the proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain meant to replace mining entirely.      Shenzhen, China’s Linzhi Inc. has begun to roll out a new Ethereum ASIC miner reportedly three times more powerful than the nearest categorical competitor, the A10+ Pro. The new machine was demoed by mining pool F2Pool in a YouTube video Saturday.      Although it may seem odd at first glance, it’s a good reminder that Eth 1.x is still around and isn’t going away anytime in the near future. Indeed, Ethereum continues to settle similar or even more value than its crypto cousin Bitcoin, according to Money Movers.      Chen Min founded Linzhi in 2018, following her departure as CTO from Canaan Creative, another prominent mining rig manufacturer. As reported by CoinDesk at the time, Min wanted to create a more powerful ASIC Ethereum miner, all the while knowing the network would eventually transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), making her firm’s Ethereum specific work obsolete.      Still, miners have at least a two-year runway with Proof-of-Work (PoW) on Ethereum. The current network, Eth 1.x, won’t be moved over to the new PoS blockchain until phase 1.5 of Eth 2.0.      “New investment decisions to build out more mining hash power for Ethereum do now have an additional time-risk factor as the reward stream now appears finite,” ConsenSys Head of R&D Robert Drost told CoinDesk in an email. “On the other hand, Eth has been trending upwards nicely, so as you say there can be money to make in battling for as many coins as possible beforehand!”      The product’s initial tests seem to be living up to expectation. According to F2Pool, the Phoenix outpaces the A10+ Pro at a near three-to-one clip in megahashes per second (2,600 MH/s to around 500 MH/s) while also being more energy efficient (3,000 watts per hour to the A10+ Pro’s 1,300 W).      Mining pools such as SparkPool and Etherchain will continue to fight out who gets the last coins issued on the proof-of-work Eth 1.x blockchain. If Eth 1.x continues chugging along for another two years, back-of-the-envelope calculations value those coins at some $3 billion dollars under current prices.      There are also transaction fees up for grabs if Ethereum’s next hot thing sticks around: decentralized finance (DeFi). This past August and September, fees on Ethereum reached all-time highs not once but twice, as DeFi applications spit out high returns on investments in what is called liquidity mining or yield farming. As reported by CoinDesk, miners enjoyed daily profits last seen during the tail end of the 2017-2018 bull market.      Lastly, Eth 2.0 may need specialized hardware orthogonal to what Linzhi and other mining firms manufacture, with the ability to support zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) computations, for example. Other blockchains such as Ethereum Classic use the same hashing algorithm as Ethereum, too, and will continue to be mined after Ethereum’s transition.      “There is significant research into on-chain computing workloads, zero-knowledge and so on,” Linzhi’s director of operations, Wolfgang Spraul, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Our technology is relevant in that area as well, that's the ETH 2.0 stuff. We do not only invest in the PoW use case, we can add programmability and then target other workloads.”      So, while many eyes are on staking, sharding and every other Eth 2.0 buzzword, Ethereum miners continue to see an upside to Eth 1.x investments.

42385397,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1r0L,1608719443,Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith Will Likely Face Trial Next September,"The U.S. government intends to argue that Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith helped North Koreans better understand how crypto could be used to bypass financial sanctions on the nation.      Griffith, who was arrested in November 2019 on charges of conspiracy to assist North Korea (DPRK) in using cryptocurrency for its own benefit, is seeking to have the case against him dismissed. While U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel, of the Southern District of New York, made a handful of rulings on minor points in the case, a full trial has been tentatively scheduled for September 2021.      According to the government's complaint, Griffith traveled to Pyongyang to speak at a blockchain conference in April 2019 despite being denied permission from the U.S. government. This is the first case involving cryptocurrency and sanctions in the U.S. courts.      In October, Griffith’s representatives filed a motion to dismiss charges levied against him. The motion argued that Griffith relaying public information on blockchain technology to North Koreans did not constitute providing the nation a service, and the government’s allegations failed to specify facts.      During the Tuesday hearing on the case, this became a strong point of contention. Judge Castel questioned if the government planned to argue that information disclosed in Griffith’s speech at the conference was “above and beyond” existing blockchain capabilities and knowledge of the DPRK.      “What I want to know is whether the government intends to stand in front of the jury and argue that the information that Mr. Griffith provided and intended to provide, as an object of the conspiracy, included information not otherwise known to the DPRK. Do you plan to do that?” he asked.      The prosecution replied it will not be making this argument because the defense’s definition of DPRK in the motion to dismiss was too broad. Instead, it will provide evidence on how Griffith’s speech and the Q&A session that followed helped individuals within the audience understand how cryptocurrency works.      “Mr. Griffith himself made statements to the FBI, in which he described a lack of sophistication of the people in the audience who are asking questions, with certain exceptions, and the types of things he was doing to help them better understand these concepts. So whether or not there is, but there are materials that reflect the DPRK as a whole or some other unknown component of the DPRK cryptocurrency capabilities is not an issue in this case,” prosecution attorney Kyle Wirshba said.      What does not appear to have been clarified are the specific charges Griffith will face: The complaint includes a broad charge of violating sanctions law, but Griffith's attorneys want to know what exactly he is being accused of doing.    Ruling    Although Judge Castel did not rule on the motion to dismiss the charges against Griffith, a number of other orders were given.      Judge Castel granted a motion by the defendants to compel the disclosure of information that the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) may have participated in Griffith’s case based on the initial communications between the FBI and OFAC from Oct. 24, 2019 until the present time.      “Generally speaking, when the prosecution conducts a joint investigation with another state or federal agency, the courts in this circuit have held that the prosecutor's duty extends to reviewing the materials in the possession of that other agency for Brady purposes,” Judge Castel said.      The Brady Rule requires the prosecution to disclose any information in possession of the government that could clear someone of guilt.      The judge denied a motion by the defendant to reveal the identity of a witness that the government has yet to confirm. The government has no obligation to do so until 30 days prior to the trial, Judge Castel said.      Read more: USA v. Virgil Griffith: What We Know (and Don’t) in the Bombshell Crypto Sanctions Case      Citing the prosecution’s statement it will not argue that the information Griffith passed on during his speech at the conference exceeded the DPRK’s crypto and blockchain capabilities, Judge Castel deferred ruling on the motion by the defense to search for information held by government agencies regarding those capabilities.      Instead, he asked the two parties to work on a stipulation on the issue and submit it to the court by Jan. 25, 2021.      Finally, the judge proposed a range of dates for commencing the trial in September 2021. It was also decided that Griffith’s attorneys will submit a letter requesting the easing of some of the restrictions placed on the defendant.      “As you know, he's been on very, very tough restrictions,” defense lawyer Brian E. Klein said, adding that Griffith has no internet access and can’t leave his home.

Ripple owns more than 4% of MoneyGram and paid MoneyGram $9.3 million in the third quarter of this year for providing liquidity for Ripple’s XRP-based cross-border settlement network. All in, Ripple has given MoneyGram $52 million for using Ripple’s on-demand liquidity (ODL) service.      On-demand liquidity through Ripple’s xRapid cross-border payment service allows companies to transfer funds from one currency to XRP and from XRP to another currency. This allows enterprises to avoid opening a bank account in countries they want to send payments to, letting them avoid holding funds there for cross-border transactions.      Read more: An SEC Victory in Ripple Case Would Render XRP ‘Untradeable,’ Market Pros Say      MoneyGram, currently the second-largest money transfer provider in the world behind Western Union, has used Ripple’s ODL to move in and out of four currencies since June 2019. At the time, CEO Alex Holmes said MoneyGram was becoming a “chief partner for cross-border settlement using digital assets.”      In the complaint filed Tuesday, the SEC seems to make a mention of MoneyGram when it alleges that “onboarding onto ODL was not organic or market-driven” but rather “subsidized by Ripple.” MoneyGram was not identified by name in the SEC complaint though it did specify that Ripple paid the unnamed money transmitter $52 million in fees through September 2020, in an arrangement that began in 2019.      “The Money Transmitter became yet another conduit for Ripple’s unregistered XRP sales into the market, with Ripple receiving the added benefit that it could tout its inorganic XRP ‘use’ and trading volume for XRP,” the SEC alleged.

First announced in October, the fund was established to support Bitcoin developers in their work on projects that support the cryptocurrency’s underlying technology.      The first two developers, João Barbosa and pseudonymous developer 0xB10C, were chosen by the fund’s advisory board, which includes Stanford cryptography professor Dan Boneh and Bitcoin developers Carla Kirk-Cohen, Anthony Towns, Amiti Uttarwar and Felix Weis.      Read more: Amiti Uttarwar: Building Bitcoin’s Future      Coinbase said 0xB10C, the creator of mempool.observer, will work on a software fork visualizer on Bitcoin’s Signet test network, a tool which could be used to monitor updates of the Bitcoin software (and which may prove useful in light of Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade). They will also continue to publish research and work on Bitcoin code review.      Barbosa, who only just recently lost his funding from mining company Bitmain, will work on a user interface for Bitcoin Core that will allow its users to access advanced functions without having to use the command line – a coding interface that allows you to talk to your computer to make it interact with applications in the form of text lines.      Additionally, the advisory board chose Barbosa because they “value [his] previous work on code reviewing, and wanted to ensure he could continue in the future,” the release said.      ""I'm very fortunate to keep contributing to the project on a regular basis. I hope to be up to the task for one more year,"" Barbosa told CoinDesk.    Bitcoin developer funding    Barbosa, along with a handful of other Bitcoin developers, recently had funding cut off from Bitcoin mining behemoth Bitmain.      As evidenced by Barbosa hopping from one grant to another, open-source work is fraught with financial uncertainty, and even the best Bitcoin developers may be funded for their work only partially or not at all.      For much of Bitcoin’s history, its developers have worked as volunteers to maintain and improve Bitcoin’s code. Some companies including Blockstream and Chaincode, among others, have funded Bitcoin Core development since before 2017, but it hasn’t been until Bitcoin’s latest time in the limelight that other companies and organizations have upped their efforts to dole out grants.
