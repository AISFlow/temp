11372759,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525219,1680302646,"Bitcoin Market Structure Points To New Uptrend, Here’s Why","Bitcoin price is trading above $28,000, only roughly $4,000 away from doubling in value since the most recent low. The recent changes in market structure in BTCUSD could indicate a new uptrend is taking form. Find out why below. Bitcoin Price Forms Uptrend, Will It Sustain? Bitcoin has outperformed nearly every other asset in finance in 2023. In recent weeks, it has been sucking the capital out of altcoins due to its seemingly unstoppable power in the face of a banking crisis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Priced In Bank Shares Is The Crypto Chart You Can’t Miss With the top cryptocurrency by market cap trading just under $30,000 per coin, it’s now within striking distance of a key level that could signal that the bottom is in. After a bottom is in, a new bull run forms. According to the BTCUSD price chart, Bitcoin could be on the brink of a new uptrend in the most definitive terms. In fact, an uptrend, in theory, is already active. BTC has been in an uptrend already | BTCUSD on TradingView.com BTCUSD And Defining The Current Crypto Market Trend The Merriam-Webster dictionary refers to an uptrend as any upward turn in economic activity or business. More specifically to technical analysis, an uptrend is a series of higher highs and higher lows. As BTCUSD or any asset follows this sequence of swing highs and swing lows (smaller fluctuations are allowed) the uptrend remains intact. Related Reading: This Bullish Bitcoin Technical Signal Suggests The Bottom Is In When a new lower low or lower high is set, the sequence breaks and market structure now becomes what is referred to as consolidation. If lower lows and lower highs form in a repeated series, then the market is now in a downtrend. It is that simple. Since November 2022, Bitcoin price has set a series of higher highs and higher lows. If this continues, even the most bearish on BTC will have to admit that these conditions, by definition, indicate a new upward trend. #Bitcoin is in an uptrend in the simplest sense of the term. pic.twitter.com/V8QXZtvcMY — Tony ""The Bull"" (@tonythebullBTC) March 31, 2023 Follow @TonyTheBullBTC on Twitter or join the TonyTradesBTC Telegram for exclusive daily market insights and technical analysis education.

42412465,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4yzE,1680302348,ZeroSync and Blockstream to Broadcast Bitcoin Zero-Knowledge Proofs From Space,"Swiss non-profit ZeroSync Association and Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream say they plan to broadcast Bitcoin zero-knowledge proofs – a type of cryptography that’s become one of 2023's hottest blockchain-tech trends – from Blockstream’s satellite.  Using zk-proofs to validate the Bitcoin blockchain means nodes don’t have to download the chain’s current 500GB of data and can therefore sync in fractions of a second instead of hours or days.  Blockstream’s satellite network provides free global access to Bitcoin by broadcasting the blockchain to the entire planet, including areas with unreliable Internet coverage. ZeroSync expects the first experimental broadcast to take place by the end of the year.  The newly formed ZeroSync Association was launched on Tuesday and plans to help scale Bitcoin by using zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs), a cryptographic technique to prove the validity of information without revealing the information itself.  “The security of Bitcoin requires every participant to verify every transaction,” ZeroSync co-founder Robin Linus told CoinDesk. “That didn't scale well until now. Proof systems like STARKs have been invented. Applying them to generate a proof of Bitcoin's chain state, and broadcasting it via satellite, can bring Bitcoin to almost everyone in the world. Don't trust, verify.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/31/zerosync-and-blockstream-to-broadcast-bitcoin-zero-knowledge-proofs-from-space,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2404adfc14ffc13d716b146b98fb4923c0bc313-6720x3780.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421282,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmbV,1680301947,"Over 7,000 Players Successfully Converged in Yuga Labs' Otherside Metaverse 'Second Trip'","Yuga Labs completed a successful Second Trip on Saturday, providing members of its community with a preview of what’s to come in its Otherside metaverse world that is slated to launch later this year.  According to Yuga Labs, about 7,200 players attended the 90-minute trial run. Holders of the Otherdeed non-fungible tokens (NFT) – a collection linked to land in the Otherside metaverse – were invited to join the experience, along with one guest each.  CoinDesk attended the closed event as a guest and was able to interact with other “voyagers” and participate in the action-packed storyline.  Tripping out  From the start, the experience was designed to transport players into a sci-fi fantasy world that combined elements of popular MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) and NFT culture.  Users began the trip by entering the “Infinity Space,” an empty arena where voyagers could familiarize themselves with controlling their avatars and sending messages to other players. Voyagers were able to gather in small groups and speak to each other directly – a feature meant to mimic a “real life event,” in which players could only talk and hear others when in close proximity, said Yuga Labs chief creative officer Michael Figge.  After about 20 minutes, large screens appeared over the Infinity Space and broadcasted a message from Bored Ape Yacht Club mascot Curtis, who was “hosting” the experience.  The ape character split the group into four teams based on colors and announced their respective captains: Luster (yellow) was led by Yuga Labs community program manager Lowbellie, Crimson (red) was led by Twitch streamer Brycent, Veldan (green) was led by Snoop Dogg’s son and NFT collector Cordell Broadus, and the winning team, Glacia (blue), was led by gamer Jimmy Wong.  Voyagers’ outfits transformed into their assigned team colors, and players began to assemble into groups. Moments later, a wormhole to the “swamp” opened, transporting players to their team area to complete tasks and earn points. The game involved several wacky directives, including gathering “magic blobs” to give to digital toads that shot flames from their mouths. All the while, voyagers could run, jump, fly and explore the multidimensional space.  The winners of the game received “winged helmets” that Yuga Labs said would be airdropped to their wallets.  Showing promise  While some existing metaverse experiences are paired with poor graphics, lagging speeds and virtual spaces that are difficult to navigate, Otherside’s user experience was relatively robust and easy to use in comparison.  Notably, the experience was incredibly detailed and didn’t appear to have widespread congestion issues despite thousands of players converging on the space at once.  Feedback from players was generally positive, with many sharing optimism for the future of the platform.  Still, some users complained about connectivity issues and questioned the significance of several in-game artifacts that remain shrouded in mystery.  A public rehearsal for the Otherside  The gamification of the Otherside platform is a part of Yuga Labs’ broader strategy to build excitement and allow holders to familiarize themselves with the experience ahead of its official launch. Yuga Labs hosted the First Trip in July 2022, welcoming 4,600 players to the Otherside for the first time. Players that returned to the Otherside for the Second Trip are eligible to claim an Obelisk, a digital collectible to commemorate their adventures.  According to data from secondary marketplace OpenSea, Otherdeed NFTs have done 568,607 ETH in trading volume, or just over $1 billion. At the time of writing, the collection has a floor price of 1.67 ETH, or about $3,000.  Figge told CoinDesk that more Trips are being planned ahead of the platform’s official launch. Meanwhile, he’s focused on building out an ecosystem that will eventually be accessible at all times to token-holders.  “We're doing these grand theatrical experiences right now with First Trip and Second Trip, these are basically 90-minute big Broadway shows,” said Figge. “But we are taking all of that technology that we've been building and funneling it into a version of the Otherside that will be built and accessible with a higher level of cadence.”  Each Trip executed by the team provides feedback on the parts of the experience that worked and those that need fine-tuning. Spencer Tucker, chief gaming officer at Yuga Labs, told CoinDesk that the biggest takeaway from the Second Trip was that players want more intimate “breakouts” and community-building experiences to strengthen relationships with fellow voyagers.  “As we build in the future, it’s something we'll definitely take into consideration because you can have persistence, but you also need the ability to have your own sort of identity and form your own clique,” said Tucker. “As we explore what the persistent space looks like, we want to allow people to stop and smell the roses sometimes while still having really cool experiences that they can dive into.”  Yuga hasn’t yet set a date for its Third Trip. However, Figge and Tucker shared that in the coming months there will be more advanced experiences and opportunities for token holders to enter the Otherside.

42412469,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4z16,1680300318,"Crypto Market March Roundup: Bitcoin Rises Amid Banking Uncertainties, Macro Headwinds","An eventful March of bank failures, ongoing inflationary and other macroeconomic headwinds left investors mulling where to place their trust – and cash – and ultimately proved favorable for bitcoin and other cryptos considered stores of value impervious to turmoil.  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at around $28,500, up over 21% in March. At one point Wednesday, the largest cryptocurrency by market value broke the $29,100 mark to reach its highest mark since June 2022. BTC has widely outperformed the S&P 500, Nasdaq and other traditional assets. The tech-focused Nasdaq rose over 4% for the month.  “The macro landscape has been extremely constructive for 'alternative money' in March,” Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata, told CoinDesk in an email, adding that both BTC and gold, traditionally viewed as safe-haven assets, had seen “explosive upside volatility” this month.  Magadini wrote that recent BTC’s volatility in the options market following the implosion of crypto-friendly Silvergate and Silicon Valley banks differed significantly from the more dramatic shifts following the collapse of exchange FTX and other crypto calamities last year.  “BTC is exploding higher,” he said. “This rush into ‘alternative money’ (BTC and GOLD) shows some panic around purely holding USD.”  This month’s gains came, even as the crypto industry endured the collapse of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank and a flurry of regulatory enforcement activity. This week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, and its founder Chengpeng Zhao over alleged regulatory violations. The aftershocks of the banking crisis rocked the stablecoin sector earlier in the month, but cryptos were largely unaffected.  For institutional investors, one of their biggest concerns hasn't been “the market volatility around bitcoin” but “the regulatory volatility and the regulatory uncertainty,” Ben McMillan, chief investment officer of crypto asset manager IDX Digital Assets, told CoinDesk prior to the Binance-CFTC lawsuit news.  Ether (ETH), was recently changing hands at $1,820, up 13% in March. Earlier in the month, the second-largest crypto in market value hit $1,861, its highest level since August 2022.  Winners  Encrypted messaging protocol Mask Network’s native MASK token grabbed the trophy as the best-performing token among 160 assets in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), soaring 68% in March to change hands at $6.30.  The jump came after a whale withdrew some 3.6 million MASK tokens, worth around $14.8 million at that time, from several exchanges through multiple addresses, according to an analysis by on-chain researcher Lookonchain.  Lookonchain said that past data patterns show that “in many cases, transfer-in will lead to higher MASK prices, while transfer-out will cause a price drop.”  Crypto payment platform XRP Ledger’s XRP token was the second-best performer, climbing over 41% to recently trade at 54 cents. Part of the surge came after reports that XRP issuer, Ripple was well-placed to win a landmark case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange.  “XRP has been in a legal struggle for a while, but the fact that we may finally see a legal conclusion for XRP makes it gain a lot of value,” Amberdata's Magadini said.  Injective Protocol’s INJ token and Stellar’s XLM token rose 34% and 26%, respectively.  Looking by sectors, the CoinDesk Currency Index was the month's biggest winner with a 21% gain, followed by the Smart Contract Platform sector’s 9% advance.  Losers  Chain's XCN token in the CMI's Currency sector was among the biggest CMI laggards, plunging over 53% in March.  Cross-chain bridge protocol Stargate Finance’s STG token in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector tanked over 32% to trade at 71 cents, according to data aggregator CoinGecko.  The StargateDAO intended to reissue STG tokens by March 15 amid community concerns about liquidity and security stemming from the protocol’s entanglement with Alameda Research, the trading arm of embattled crypto exchange FTX. But the group abandoned those plans after a rebuke from FTX liquidators.  The AMP token, a collateralized token designed to accelerate transactions in crypto networks, dropped 28%, while crypto exchange LCX’s LCX token fell 27%.  Going forward  Stefan Rust, a crypto investor and CEO of data aggregator Truflation, wrote in an email to CoinDesk on Wednesday that traditional finance (TradFi) had reached a tipping point. “It seems people are realizing that the banking crisis isn't really over,” he wrote.  Rust noted that the bank collapses had eliminated valuable resources for investors and others eager to participate in the digital-asset ecosystem and alluded to rising regulatory pressures in the U.S. that may be creating obstacles to the industry's growth. ""Many are trying to navigate the on- and off-ramp situation and find loopholes,"" he wrote.  But he added that the recent unsettled relationship between DeFi and TradFi is likely to steady. “Over the long term, there will be a whole new on and offramp system between DeFi, crypto and the fiat world, as trust in centralized, regulated institutions has definitely had its back broken,” he wrote. “There is no longer a need to keep all your funds in one bank, one central entity that holds all of your assets in custody, as who knows what will happen with that entity and ultimately your savings.”  “Markets always take a bit of time to readjust, reacquire confidence and find new paths and funding streams. Money will always move uphill, however,” he wrote.

However, in the last week, the altcoin’s price action has dulled out, and XMR has been unable to secure significant gains. Although Monero gained just 1.5% over the last 24 hours, it noted a sharp recovery from the $140 zone to $180 at the beginning of this year, but the bulls could not sustain the recovery. Since recovering from the $130 mark, the coin has been attempting to rise on its chart, but the daily outlook of XMR shows mixed signals. Related Reading: US To Sell 41,500 Bitcoin (BTC) In Four Batches, Crash Inevitable? Although buying strength is positive, it is not significant. Buyers are still in control of the price, and demand is present, which reflects an increase in accumulation. XMR’s price depends on Bitcoin surpassing the $29,000 price to move closer to its immediate resistance. If XMR remains constricted over the next trading sessions, there is a possibility that the bulls may tire out. This would result in a price drop to its local support. The market capitalization of XMR has noted an uptick, displaying demand on the daily chart. Monero Price Analysis: One-Day Chart XMR was trading at $157, with overhead resistance for the coin at $161. The buyers would need a push to help the altcoin breach the above level. However, even if XMR crossed the $161 mark, the bulls would not be secured unless it trades past the $168 price mark. On the flip side, support for XMR rested at $154. The inability to hold the price at that level would drag Monero to $148. The amount of Monero traded in the last session was green, depicting an increase in buying strength on the one-day chart. Technical Analysis As XMR moved above the $154 zone, the altcoin began to note a slight recovery in buying strength. The Relative Strength Index indicated an upswing from the half-line, suggesting buyers were gaining strength on the daily chart. Additionally, the XMR price moved past the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating that buyers were in control and driving the price momentum in the market. Furthermore, XMR was above the 50-SMA (green) line, which suggests a chance of continued bullishness. The buying sentiment in the market remained strong as the price action on the chart was positive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which indicates the price momentum and change, was positive and displayed green histograms, signaling a buy signal for the coin.

42412462,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4ywQ,1680299048,TUSD Stablecoin Daily Trading Volume Surpasses $1B After Binance Boost,"Trading with the trueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin has surged over the week, crypto price tracker CoinGecko’s data shows, a result of crypto exchange Binance’s support for the token, including a zero-fee discount to buy and sell bitcoin (BTC).  TUSD’s 24-hour trading volume surpassed $1 billion for most of Thursday and Friday, according to CoinGecko. It is a significant increase from earlier this month, when TUSD recorded mostly sub-$100 million daily trading volume.  The BTC-TUSD pair on Binance alone recorded $713 million in trading volume in the past 24 hours, per Binance’s data.     The stablecoin’s recent popularity comes after Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, picked TUSD as a favored stablecoin trading pair on its platform amid a regulatory crackdown on its namesake Binance USD (BUSD). New York regulators ordered BUSD issuer Paxos, a fintech firm based in the state, to stop minting these tokens.  Binance had supported BUSD through a zero-fee trading promotion and by booting rival stablecoins including TUSD from its platform.  Following the New York directive for Paxos, Binance reintroduced trading with TUSD in early March, then granted a zero-fee trading promotion exclusively to the BTC-TUSD pair starting March 22. This week, the exchange expanded TUSD trading to popular cryptocurrencies, including solana (SOL), optimism (OP), polygon (MATIC) and XRP.  In an email to CoinDesk last week, Clara Medalie, head of research at crypto markets data provider Kaiko, wrote that Binance had “crowned a possible successor” to its namesake stablecoin in TUSD.  The token’s rapid growth highlights a major reshuffling of the $132 billion stablecoin market, which has been wrestling with ongoing regulatory actions and a banking crisis. TUSD has been one of the winners so far. Its market capitalization has mushroomed to $2 billion from below $800 million at the start of January, making it the fifth largest stablecoin.  TUSD is issued by digital asset firm ArchBlock, and its intellectual property is owned by an Asian investment conglomerate Techteryx, CoinDesk has reported. Some reports linked the token to crypto investor Justin Sun, who was recently sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for market manipulation, but issuer ArchBlock denied his involvement.",POSITIVE,TUSD,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | TUSD,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/31/tusd-stablecoin-daily-trading-volume-surpasses-1b-after-binance-boost,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2fbb9e4d719b1abf5730c2a0f98014e8cca73a29-1438x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One can be found around the $30,000 region, while the other is just above the $40,000 region. In the daily timeframe, the asset is looking to tap into the liquidity of the major high at the $30,000 zone as it is closer to that level. Should Bitcoin eventually tap into that zone, we could see a major slowdown in the rally before resuming the bullish momentum. This is because on every price chart, the liquidity of a major high as being taken there is always either a significant retracement or a prolonged range. This dynamic hints at accumulation from investors before a push that results in a bullish move or an expansion to the upside. In addition, major highs also provide a take-profit opportunity for larger investors who might not be in it long-term. This means several large investors would have put a set take profit on their long position for Bitcoin, which will be triggered if Bitcoin should ever tap into the $30,000 zone. In that sense, Bitcoin could trend sideways or plummet into previous support if large investors decide to take profits on their positions.

42411018,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB3ae,1680292673,How Will NFTs Be Taxed? Understanding the IRS' New Proposed Guidelines,"Cryptocurrency is still in its infancy and non-fungible tokens (NFT) are an even newer asset class, only coming to mainstream notice in 2017 with the launch of CryptoPunks. So it’s no surprise that historic policies and laws are still catching up to the new realities of digital asset ownership.  Case in point: Last week, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published a document requesting comment and proposing new guidance on the tax treatment of NFTs. The statement, Notice 2023-27, questions whether NFTs should be classified the same as traditionally accepted collectibles such as stamps, physical artworks and fine wine. It also leaves open to interpretation whether digital art can be included in the category of collectibles, or whether it needs a new category of its own.  Deciphering the current IRS guidance on NFTs  Historically, IRC Section 408 includes only five categories of assets categorized as collectibles: art, rugs or antiques, metals or gems, stamps or coins and alcoholic beverages. Section 408 gives the IRS authority to define new collectibles, but it specifically notes these must be “tangible personal property.” Miles Fuller, head of government at crypto tax firm Tax Bit and former IRS chief of counsel, calls this predicament a “legal rub.”  “The IRS actually can't, at a regulatory level, say they’re categorizing all NFTs as collectibles because NFTs aren't tangible,” Fuller explains.  Nonetheless, he considers Notice 2023-27 a promising step towards increased clarity regarding the tax liabilities of NFT collectors. In particular, the IRS intends to treat NFT as collectibles if they are associated with a physical item, an interpretation described in the document as a “look-through analysis.”  There are a few specific cases where this look-through analysis will come in handy already. For instance, the fractionalized NFT platform Otis sells NFTs linked to physical assets like rare books and trading cards, or companies like the BlockBar, a Web3 company focused on NFTs linked to real-life rare wines and liquor. In these scenarios, an NFT may serve a similar purpose as a title or property deed, explains Fuller. The IRS is not necessarily interested in taxing the NFT as an asset in and of itself, when really it's the token’s tie to a physical asset that makes it valuable.  “The IRS is not trying to tax the technology,” Fuller said. “It’s just trying to tax the economic unit that the technology gives rise to. The tax code is all about taxing the actual economic property.”  The notice also appears to question whether the look-through analysis applies to digital art files themselves and whether digital art can be classified as a collectible like its physical counterparts. Justin Macari, a New York-based certified public accountant, predicts the IRS will look closely at intellectual property (IP) rights when determining whether a digital asset has collector value. In the notice, the IRS lists both topics in the list of requested feedback, asking:  How might the potential for the owner of an NFT to receive additional rights or assets (such as additional NFTs) due to ownership of the NFT (even in the absence of a specific contractual right under the NFT) be treated?  What factors might be relevant if the NFT’s associated right is less than full ownership of an asset (for example, if the associated right is simply personal use of a digital file)?  “I think it's going to come down to IP use,” Macari told CoinDesk. “I'm going to be writing to the IRS to give comments here because there's so much to be said.”  Macari cited the example of rapper Snoop Dogg, who owns Bored Ape #6723. Bored Ape owners have rights to the IP associated with their NFTs. As Macari argues, if owning the NFT attached to a particular profile picture (PFP) or 1-of-1 NFT gives someone the right to create physical merch and profit-generating franchises, this could be a clear identifier of long-term collector value. In contrast, NFTs that simply represent digital assets, such as metaverse land, more closely resemble the IRS’ definition of normal capital assets and would be taxed accordingly.  See Also: How AI Is Changing Artistic Creation and Challenging IP Laws  Normal capital assets are taxed at a rate ranging from 0% to 20% based on a person’s income level, whereas collectible assets are taxed at a 28% rate. Despite the potential increase in tax rate for NFT collectors, both Fuller and Macari believe increased clarity is a net positive.  “I see this [notice] as a good thing because it gives way more legitimacy to NFTs as a whole,” Macari said.  How to submit comments to the IRS  If you have thoughts on the matter, you can submit comments in writing on or before June 19, 2023. Make sure you should include a reference to Notice 2023-27.  The easiest way to have your comment considered is electronically via the Federal eRulemaking Portal at www.regulations.gov (type “Notice 2023-27” in the search field on the Regulations.gov home page to find this notice and submit comments).

This new chain enables smart contract migration from Ethereum to Polygon more seamlessly. So far, the chain has just $1.5 million in deposits and a little over 5 thousand unique users. Activity lags the recently launched zkEVM competitor zkSync Era. Polygon zkEVM brings slightly different token economics than the PoS chain as ETH is the gas fee currency rather than MATIC. It's been a big couple of weeks for the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ecosystem. In addition to Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ) airdropping roughly 13% of a new governance token to network participants last Thursday, the developers at Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) launched a new zkEVM chain earlier this week. zkEVM stands for ""Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine"" and it could be a significant product for crypto developers. In this article, we'll explore what this new zkEVM will enable, compare post-launch activity to a similar peer, and address the possible impact on Polygon's MATIC token. What is zkEVM? Simply put, zkEVM chains offer another technological method for scaling Ethereum's base layer through secondary layers. There are several different ways Ethereum L2 chains have attacked the scalability problem. Those approaches include Plasma, Optimistic Rollups, and zkRollups. While each approach has different technical specifications, one of the core elements important to a rollup is that not every piece of information in a transaction is communicated on-chain. This allows for faster transactions, added privacy, and a much larger throughput capacity among other improvements. Alex Gluchowski is the founder of Matter Labs, the core developer of zkSync. Gluchowski previously published this table comparing some of the key differences between the scaling approaches: As of 2/18/21 (Matter Labs/Alex Gluchowski) According to this table, there appears to be a reasonable expectation that zkRollups have more advantages than alternative chain structures if they can be implemented properly. Though it should be noted this graphic comes from the founder of a chain developer that, now like Polygon, offers an Ethereum scaling chain that utilizes zkRollups. The biggest element that has been missing from the leading zkRollup chains like zkSync Lite or StarkNet to this point is EVM compatibility. That's what the zkEVM chains now bring to the equation. This is important because the zkEVM chain will allow EVM developers to migrate any applications they've built on Ethereum natively to zkEVM chains seamlessly and enjoy the benefits of the scalability enhancements. zkEVMs have been in development for a while and there are several teams that have been working on this technology. As fate would have it, a lot of these zkEVM chains are going live at the same time. In recent weeks, we've seen the launches of Polygon zkEVM, zkSync Era, and Scroll testnet. Early Network Indications It's important to keep in mind that Polygon's zkEVM is a new chain that works differently than Polygon's main proof of stake chain. As such, any assessment of network adoption of the zkEVM is a very small sample size and these are developments that investors in both ETH and MATIC should keep an eye on over time. Unique Users (Dune Analytics/Marcov) After roughly 3 days, Polygon's zkEVM chain has seen a little over 5.2k depositors and just $1.5 million in deposits. The overwhelming majority of which has been ETH: Token Amount TXS ETH $1.3m 5.4k USDC $125.4k 54.0 MATIC $72.8k 27.0 USDT $26.3k 46.0 DAI $193.7 7.0 Source: Dune Analytics/Marcov This level of activity is dramatically less than what has been observed on zkSync Era, which has gone from essentially nothing to over $69 million in just 1 week: zkSync Era TVL (L2 Beat) The kneejerk reaction here could be that zkSync Era is simply a better chain than Polygon zkEVM. But I think there is more to it than that. For one thing, we're still fresh off the Arbitrum token airdrop from last week and there has been rampant speculation online that zkSync will be one of the next chains to do an airdop. This is something that Alex Gluchowski has already thrown cold water on according to CoinDesk. But even the small prospect of an airdrop could conceivably juice activity from speculators. That element is missing from Polygon's zkEVM because Polygon already has a native token on its PoS chain. And this brings us to the MATIC token impact of the Polygon zkEVM. zkEVM Token Impact One of the key distinctions Polygon bulls should consider is the fact that MATIC is not the gas token of Polygon's zkEVM, ETH is now the gas token on that chain. However, MATIC will still be required for staking validation of the zkEVM. But this is a fundamental shift in the utility of the MATIC token that admittedly could make MATIC much less interesting as an investment idea if you don't plan to stake either through validation or delegation. However, it's important to note that this does not change MATIC's utility as gas on Polygon's PoS chain. But if developers do choose the Polygon zkEVM over the original Polygon chain, MATIC would transition into more of a staking token than the multi-faceted utility token that it currently is. And that would be something that long term MATIC bulls like myself would have to consider in our own assessments of whether MATIC has a place in a crypto portfolio or not. Summary While the action on Polygon's zkEVM chain has been admittedly slow, the PoS chain continues to make blocks and generate fees. Daily active users of the PoS chain have remained high in the 325-350k area on a regular basis going back to October 2022. Polygon (Token Terminal) Polygon is building out an impressive ecosystem on top of Ethereum. This new zkEVM chain is exciting but does potentially have a tokenomic drawback from the new transaction fee model. While the MATIC token is still necessary for gas on the original chain, its utility on the new rollup chain theoretically lessens the organic bid for MATIC as transactions scale over time. I personally haven't sold any MATIC and maintain that it will be one of the best performing cryptocurrencies of 2023. But crypto investors should consider the competitive landscape in the L2 market when allocating portfolios.",NEUTRAL,ETH | MATIC,ETH | ICO | MATIC | AIRDROP | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4591571-polygon-zkevm-latest-development-for-matic?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11275746.jpeg

Synthetix charges fees to traders who use the platform and distributes them to those who stake its SNX token.  The surge comes ahead of Synthetix's weekly allocation of 200,000 OP, Optimism’s governance tokens, to traders over the span of 17 weeks, according to improvement proposal 2003.

The NFA – which as a so-called self-regulatory organization occupies a space between the federal government and industry – has more than 100 members involved in digital assets, the organization said in a statement on the new rule, which is set to go into effect on May 31. The NFA's self-regulation of the derivatives industry allows it to impose standards on its members under penalty of fines and other punishment, and this rule extends that power more explicitly to the crypto sector.  The compliance rule – now limited to involvement with bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) – gives the NFA “the ability to discipline a member or take other action to protect the public if a member commits fraud or similar misconduct with respect to its spot digital asset commodity activities,” the group said in the statement on Wednesday. It also requires members to supervise their activity closely and says that members involved in spot crypto commodity activity “must adopt and implement appropriate supervisory policies and procedures over these activities.”  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees the NFA and the wider industry, though questions remain about the extent of its authority over digital assets. A number of legislative efforts in Congress have sought to give the CFTC undeniable powers over crypto commodities and the spot market, but the bills haven’t produced any results.  “This is a clear example of using existing authority to ensure that there are customer protections in place,” CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham said Friday in a statement posted on the CFTC website. “These obligations will require NFA members and associates to explicitly disclose the risks associated with trading spot bitcoin and ether, so that customers are fully informed before making any trading decisions.”  UPDATE (March 31, 2023, 18:11 UTC): Adds comment from CFTC Commissioner Pham.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | COMMODITY | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/31/us-futures-watchdog-issues-compliance-rule-for-crypto-activities-among-members,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba52f7bccf2ae307a3c4c7efe5945ed295f5380d-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421270,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmKz,1680282085,What Hindenburg Research’s Takedown of Block Says About Money and Crime,"On March 23, Hindenburg Research released a lengthy research report alleging in part that the Cash App payments tool created by Jack Dorsey’s Block (SQ), formerly Square, has been rampantly abused by criminals, and that Block hasn't taken sufficient steps to halt that activity.  Hindenburg is a fairly new but widely respected research-based short seller that has successfully exposed fraud at companies such as Nikola (NKLA). Observers have so far found Block’s rebuttals of the report unconvincing, and even evasive. The allegations are serious for Block and the fintech sector and deserve attention from the crypto industry, too. Cash App is a significant bitcoin on-ramp, for one thing, and so there are potentially direct impacts.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But more deeply, the (unsurprising) discovery that Cash App has been a vector for criminal transactions and identity fraud helps cast enduring criticisms of cryptocurrency in a more nuanced light.  On the most superficial level, it’s an opportunity for some satisfying but low-IQ whataboutism. As Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) moves to assemble her anti-crypto army, is she equally concerned about fraud and crime facilitated by traditional financial services? The bank Credit Suisse (CS) not only just blew up because of its risk-loving ways, but also because it facilitated “torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes,” according to accusations.  These are fun points to make. But as I said, whataboutism is an entry-level critique for crypto advocates. Malfeasance somewhere else doesn’t excuse it in your own backyard.  Instead, the Block allegations, like the persistent endemic corruption at major banks, should invite deeper consideration of the relationship between money, control and profit. Cryptocurrency reshapes that trilemma.  Cash App, like most banks and corporate-owned payments processors, has accepted substantial responsibility for policing its customers in exchange for the right to generate a profit from processing payments.  See also: Hindenburg Research Offers $1M Reward to Uncover Tether's Backing  The Hindenburg allegations drive home the deep conflict of interest inherent to this dynamic. Whether or not it was a conscious, deliberate strategy on the part of Cash App, using the app for illicit transactions did, in whatever small way, feed into its bottom line. This is even more obvious and direct when banks cater to criminal customers.  Not all networks  A more generous take would be that it’s unreasonable to expect even the most pure-hearted payments operator to block all criminal activity. They are dealing with millions of customers, and those looking to evade control systems will always find loopholes.  Even in its attempts to blunt Hindenburg’s allegations, the best Block can do is say that only 3% of activity on Cash App is from unverified users – that is, those whose real-world identity is unclear. While not quite an index of criminal activity, that ratio is vastly higher than the sub-1% proportion of criminal activity on public blockchains, according to Chainalysis.  Neither of these is a good thing. But blockchains have at least two major advantages in the discussion of financial enforcement. The first, and most immediately important, is transparency. Most public blockchains retain records of all transactions, and sleuths can often follow the trail to the really bad guys.  Both banks and corporate rails like Cash App are relatively opaque by comparison, their workings accessible only to law enforcement and regulators backed by state power – if then. That makes it much more likely that enforcement will be a game of selective whack-a-mole, with politics potentially affecting who gets bopped first and hardest.  Crypto offers a framework that removes both selective censorship and the profit motive from financial infrastructure, cutting the Gordian knot of politicized payments. Bitcoin miners don’t have the individual power to block payments on the network. That puts responsibility for controlling what people do with their money back in the hands of law enforcement where it belongs.  See also: David Z. Morris – In Defense of Crime | Opinion  It’s unsurprising that authorities aren't fans of this increased responsibility, preferring to have convenient middlemen to lean on. A more mature society would acknowledge that in a capitalist and digital age, open access to digital payments is a human right on par with free speech. So far, that argument has held the most sway when it benefits the already wealthy and powerful.  Our civilization has faced struggles in reshaping itself around freedom of speech since the concept arose alongside the printing press, but there’s little doubt we’re stronger and happier for it. With time, freedom of payments will prove itself just as empowering for us all.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,David Z.

Assets under management increased to $13.4 billion, up 10.9% from February and up 60% from November, when the total sank to its lowest level of 2022 amid crypto exchange FTX’s collapse.  Investments in bitcoin-based products rose 14% to $22.7 billion, while ether-related ones increased 6.25% to $7.22 billion. Bitcoin’s (BTC) share of overall investment hit 72%, reaching a nine-month high in mid-March. Crypto-related products labeled “other” saw assets decrease 13.3% to $1 billion, taking their market share down to 3.2%.  “The increase in bitcoin market share was consistent with the surge in bitcoin dominance and the shift away from altcoins that investors have been making in response to the recent market turbulence,” the report stated.

Also, the U.K. abandoned its plans for a government-backed non-fungible token, citing questionable demand.  Meanwhile, we’re seeing some positive signs for adoption of NFTs as a ticketing mechanism, with Ticketmaster working with band Avenged Sevenfold for token-gated access to tickets and a major low-cost airline going all-in on issuing tickets as NFTs.  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  Disney ditches its metaverse plans: The entertainment company has laid off its small unit that was developing strategies for its expansion into the metaverse, The Wall Street Journal reported, as part of a broader company-wide restructuring. Sources told the newspaper that about 50 people tasked with using the company’s intellectual property to tell interactive digital stories lost their jobs in the shuffle. Disney began developing its metaverse strategy in 2022 and chose Polygon as its blockchain to do so.  Metaverse “cooldown:” It’s unclear why Disney decided to scrap the fledgling business unit, though other major companies that bet big on metaverse development have also scaled back their efforts in recent months. Cathy Hackl, chief metaverse officer at innovation and design consultancy Journey, told CoinDesk’s “First Mover” on Wednesday that the formerly red-hot metaverse market is facing a “cooldown moment,” though she said it’s “not necessarily a bad thing,” because many Web3 natives are continuing to build despite the downcycle.  Royal NFT mint: The U.K. Treasury has canceled its plans for a government-backed NFT that was meant to signal the U.K.’s openness toward Web3. The idea was Initially proposed by U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak when he was chancellor in April 2022. He had assigned the task to the Royal Mint.  Dying demand: Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt said in a Treasury committee meeting that the government questioned the demand for such an asset. ""I think we always want to be at the cutting edge in the U.K., in terms of new technology, but the world has changed significantly since then, and we're not convinced that the demand is going to be there in the same way,” he said.  Token-gated getaways: Argentinian low-cost airline Flybondi will issue all of its e-tickets as NFTs. The new integration, an expansion of its existing relationship with NFT ticketing company TravelX, is built on the Algorand blockchain and allows passengers to change their name, transfer or sell their ""NFTickets"" on a secondary marketplace.  Are NFTs the future of flights? Not necessarily, although ticket-related rules and conditions can be integrated into the NFT's smart contract by an airline, allowing them to create a smoother and more flexible travel experience for passengers. Airlines can also generate additional revenue on NFT trading fees and empower their customers to book travel with less hassle. TravelX says that more than 60 airlines worldwide are already exploring NFT tickets.  Projects on the Rise  This Artwork is Subject to Change  Who: Created by artist Mason Rothschild  What: Dusting himself off after Hermés won the lawsuit over his provocative MetaBirkins project, Mason Rothschild has released a new NFT project titled “This Artwork is Subject to Change” through his creative agency Gasoline. Launched as an open edition on Manifold last month, the artwork attached to the 10,987 dynamic NFTs is ""subject to change"" at any point and functions as a commentary on the future of our cultural and financial systems.  How: Taking inspiration from Jack Butcher's Checks VV and Opepen NFT projects, the collection deploys several interesting mechanics – like allowing holders to “freeze” their NFT metadata on a particular artwork or ""burn"" their NFTs to transform them into smaller and rarer ones – in order to keep its community members engaged. I interviewed Rothschild to find out more about the project and his plans to make the NFT market more fun and accessible.  In Other News  Ticketmaster token pilot: The ticketing behemoth teamed up with metal band Avenged Sevenfold to offer token-gated priority access to tickets for members of the Deathbats Club NFT community.

The move expands on the platform’s initial integration of the Ethereum ecosystem last year and adds to Magic Eden’s cross-chain expansion.

Other familiar digital identities are Twitter handles and Facebook pages.

Decentralized identities are often hosted on decentralized file-sharing platforms, such as the InterPlanetary File System.

42412483,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl50wq,1680278645,Planners of Bitcoin Conference in Atlanta Move to Open Source Their Agenda,"Decentralization and open-source software are two of Bitcoin’s core tenets, yet industry conferences tend to be centralized affairs, typically funded, sponsored, planned and coordinated by companies and protocol teams.  Now there’s a fresh effort afoot to decentralize what might be the most basic but often quite political element of conference planning – the agenda.  Two crypto executives are organizing what they are describing as the first “open-source” conference for Bitcoin developers, in a reimagining of the TABConf gathering that’s been held for the past five years in Atlanta.  TABConf 2023 in September will allow members of the public to recommend what topics they want discussed and which speakers they want to hear from, according to planners of the event.  “Anyone can open an issue and the issues are not selected based on whether a sponsor decides to give us money, or whether a person has a certain status in the community,” said Brandon Iglesias, co-founder of TABConf LLC, the company behind the event. “The issues are solely chosen based on merit.”  Atlanta Bitcoin meetups  TABConf grew out of a series of popular Atlanta Bitcoin meetups organized by Iglesias and Michael Tidwell. Iglesias also serves as director of product at decentralized storage firm Storj Labs and Tidwell is director of infrastructure at Bitcoin gaming and payments firm Zebedee.  The conference debuted in 2018. Last year, TABConf had over 500 attendees and dozens of speakers, including a panel with Bitcoin Core developers Andrew Chow, Gloria Zhao, Murch and Pieter Wuille. Developer Jeremy Rubin spoke about Bitcoin smart contracts. Ruben Somsen discussed Silent Payments – single reusable addresses that can receive multiple payments from different people without compromising their privacy. Zebedee Chief Technology Officer André Neves delivered the keynote speech.  Historically, the responsibility of coming up with an agenda for the conference has fallen squarely on the shoulders of Tidwell and another organizer, Brianna Honkawa d'Estries.  What makes the 2023 event different is that anyone can submit a recommendation for a speaker or topic through the conference’s GitHub repository, making it the first open source Bitcoin conference, according to Iglesias.  “What we're doing is we're having people go on to a GitHub repository and submit ideas for workshops and panels and talks that they want to either see at the conference or give at the conference,” Iglesias told CoinDesk in an interview. “This is all public and transparent.”  More than 20 people have already submitted proposals (referred to as “issues” on GitHub). David Samson, an associate professor of evolutionary anthropology at the University of Toronto, wants to discuss “The Human Trust Paradox” – a conversation about the evolution of human trust and ultimately to “highlight the newest innovation to the trust paradox – Proof of Work.”  Naval Kohen, a PhD student in mathematics at Indiana University, submitted a proposal for a workshop on zero-knowledge proofs – a cryptographical technique used to prove the validity of information without revealing the information itself. Kohen formerly worked as a software engineer at Suredbits, a firm specializing in bitcoin derivatives.  Attendees will be able to support submissions by adding likes and comments to each proposal (here’s an example). Conference organizers will then select proposals with the most engagement a month before the event. Relevance and the amount of effort invested in a proposal will also influence selection.  “The level of detail and time potential speakers put into their issues will show and help us decide what issues will bring the most value to the TABConf 2023 attendees,” Iglesias explained. “If we don't select an issue with a lot of conversation or emojis compared to the rest, the attendees at least have transparency and can hold us accountable.”  So control will still ultimately be up to the organizers, but it’s likely to end up being a lot more community-driven than is usually the case.

42421263,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmHt,1680278236,Biden Administration Is Politicizing Crypto,"Crypto has always been a divisive issue in the U.S., but never a partisan one. Until now.  The Congressional Blockchain Caucus has had a healthy mix of Democrats and Republicans among its membership, and many legislative proposals boast bipartisan sponsorship, including the digital-assets regulatory framework bill drafted by Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)  Now, with a string of high-profile enforcement announcements from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission against crypto entities, we are at risk of losing that balance. Whether intended or not, crypto is becoming politicized, and is now on the long list of topics that a divided, gridlocked U.S. Congress is unable to resolve. Little good can come from this.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The matter is so weighty that CoinDesk Editor-in-Chief Kevin Reynolds penned an essay laying out the newsroom’s concerns about the perception regulators have allowed to foster that they are “trying to kill crypto.” It was only the second time that CoinDesk has taken a formal position on a matter, the last time being a piece that I jointly bylined with Executive Editor Marc Hochstein on a law that threatened to impose invasive surveillance on all cryptocurrency transactions.  SEC and CFTC enforcement actions and investigation warnings have been delivered, like a relentless cannon barrage, against giants of the crypto economy: Kraken, Paxos, Binance, Coinbase and more. They’ve coincided with ever-louder vocal attacks on the industry by influential progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) – who in a reelection campaign tweet this week proudly cited a Politico headline that had said she was “building an anti-crypto army” – and with a damning White House report on the sector. To many in the industry, it feels like war has been declared. Why, exactly, is unclear – other than there’s perhaps a political imperative to look tough in the wake of the FTX debacle and whipping boys are always useful in politics.  Stereotype-defying diversity  Many of us were drawn into this industry because of its potential to tackle the economic costs and restrictions imposed by financial and digital gatekeepers. It was never a left-versus-right thing. If anything, the division around crypto is defined by decentralization versus centralization.  An advocate for the technology might be inspired by anti-corporate monopoly ideas traditionally associated with the left but could equally be motivated by typically conservative beliefs in the value of free markets. In the developing world, the technology’s potential is often tied to liberal causes such as social and financial inclusion and to using it to bypass authoritarian regimes. In the developed world, it’s more often seen as a force for free-market innovation or for projecting libertarian principles on property rights.  Consider also the types of people and institutions the crypto community encompasses: retail and institutional traders, celebrity venture capitalists, nerdy computer scientists, financial engineers, impassioned human-rights activists, musicians, artists, United Nations agencies, Ukraine war effort supporters, pacifists, Austrian economists, supply-chain managers, accountants. The list goes on.  Read more: Worldwide Grassroots Projects Can Lead Crypto Recovery  That diversity can breed tension within the community. Unbeknown to many outsiders, there’s persistent acrimony between Bitcoin’s hard-money ideologues, who believe that blockchains are for money only and that bitcoin is the only form of money that matters, and Ethereum supporters, who want to apply smart contracts and tokenomics to every problem in the world.  Of course, diversity is also crypto’s strength. The breadth of backgrounds, opinions, talents, experiences, cultural perspectives and social and economic standings creates a rich pool of ideas and debate that can accelerate the open-source innovation that’s core to this technology.  In this context, the instinct among critics to pigeon-hole everyone in the industry into the stereotype of the ugly, self-obsessed, money-grabbing “crypto bro” infuriates me. It’s a lazy way to understand the world.  Worse, when politicians and regulators with access to media megaphones repeatedly use these catchall memes, they amplify these black-and-white distinctions, invoking fear and hatred for politically expedient reasons.  Yes, it’s true that some members of the crypto community are guilty of running massive scams that led to billions in losses and that others are at fault for trusting in those scam artists. But to assume that every person interested in this technology either behaves like Sam Bankman-Fried or was duped by him, wildly misrepresents the reality.  Crypto is a technology. Nothing more  The word “crypto” has sadly become one of those simplifying memes, referring in the public mind not to a suite of technologies, but to a group of people, a culture or even an industry. Saying “I’m in crypto” should be no more an expression of ideology or lifestyle preference than saying “I’m in software” or “I’m in aeronautics.”  The word “crypto” came into favor around 2017 as shorthand for the rapidly expanding industry of tokens and smart-contract platforms. This was after “blockchain” – which also got distorted by its association with a failed model of private distributed ledgers for enterprises – proved to be an misleading alternative to “Bitcoin,” which for a while was the only word that outsiders to the industry recognized.  Read more: What Is Cryptocurrency?  No one specifically chose “crypto.” It arose organically. But it was clearly a nod to cryptography, the field of math on which not only cryptocurrencies but all computing security is based. It was also an acknowledgement that only public “permissionless” blockchains, like Bitcoin – which require a cryptocurrency to function – were capable of meaningful decentralization, and of the innovation that comes with that, because corporate-led private (permissioned) blockchains were constrained by centralized gatekeepers.  So “crypto” became a broad term, used to describe a variety of technologies running on a wide range of protocols that shared this common permissionless, crypto token-based governance structure. It was meant to describe an entirely apolitical, amoral, technological concept. But thanks to the exaggerated, ill-informed claims of its critics in Washington, some in the nation’s capital now see the term as the label applied to some kind of dangerous cult.  We’re all “in crypto”  This brings us to federal agencies’ never-acknowledged but clearly intended instructions to banks to avoid servicing “crypto” companies, the outcome of a suspected shadow policy that observers are calling Operation Choke Point 2.0. Irrespective of whether there is an official campaign from bank supervisors, account officers have clearly gotten the memo to tell prospective customers that if they are “in crypto” they won’t be signed up.  Here’s the problem: What defines being “in crypto?” BNY Mellon (BNY), the biggest custodial bank in the world, runs a large crypto custody service. Is Bank of America (BAC) or Citigroup (C) going to close BNY Mellon’s counterparty lines? I rather think not.  Should bankers stop dealing with Fidelity Investments, whose digital assets unit has run Bitcoin nodes for many years, has helped fund the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s In Digital Currency Initiative and recently launched a retail crypto product? Or Franklin Templeton, which, according to a statement made to CoinDesk, is ""exploring how blockchain is integrating with assets in the cultural arena, and how we can bring those asset investment experiences to our clients."" Or Mattel (MAT), or Salesforce (CRM), both of which are working with Polygon to build Web3 services? Or Nike (NKE), which has launched an NFT platform for digital versions of its sneakers? Or Adidas? Or the National Basketball Association? Or Major League Baseball? Or the National Football League? Or J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM), which despite CEO Jamie Dimon’s protestations about cryptocurrencies being worthless, has spun up its own subsidiary dedicated to building digital currency and blockchain products?  Read more: Brands Will Save Crypto? Be Careful What You Wish For  All these companies – along with tens of thousands more – are, in a variety of ways, “in crypto,” touching the very same technology in similar ways to how Coinbase, Kraken and, dare I say it, FTX touch it, the same technology that politicians are tying to a dangerous cult.  What constitutes unwelcome crypto activity in the eyes of bankers is clearly not based on the technical considerations. It’s about perception, image, reputation and ill-defined, vague associations. And that’s a direct result of this issue being politicized.  The upshot, without any doubt, is that crypto innovators – that varied and multifaceted group of people representing a giant, diverse global community – will leave the United States. The technology doesn’t care. It’s global, borderless. So other, more constructive jurisdictions will win out while the U.S. falls behind in innovation and in the economic opportunities that come with it.  As recently as last year, when President Biden issued a balanced, forward-looking executive order on digital assets, I was of the belief that, despite Congress’ foot-dragging on important legislation and despite the SEC’s hostility toward the sector, the U.S. could still take leadership of this industry. I saw a chance for the U.S. to do with crypto what it had done with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which set a workable open-standard for regulating the internet that, when the entire world followed it, became the framework for our online world. That chance is now lost.  (CORRECTION March 31, 2023 23:22 UTC): Corrects to clarify Franklin Templeton's explorative work with blockchain technology.

The government intends to liquidate the remaining 41,490 bitcoins in four tranches over the course of this calendar year, the filing said.  Crypto traders were spooked after seeing U.S. authorities transfer over $200 million worth of bitcoin to Coinbase (COIN) on March 9. Bitcoin's price was volatile as a result, rising as much as 9.7% in a 24-hour period before returning to where it was before.  Now, however, bitcoin traders remain unperturbed by renewed concerns of selling pressure from the U.S. government, as the cryptocurrency continues to trade around $28,000.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/31/us-government-sold-216m-of-seized-silk-road-bitcoin-this-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e48c82dbe5c106b9e24fceed14c77ef575c07e0-1438x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The token drifted up 0.2% to $28.36K and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) advanced 2.1% to $1.82K at 11:43 a.m. ET. Data from CoinMarketCap showed the value of the overall crypto market gained 0.8% to $1.19T. After taking a breather in the previous session, the world's largest token ( BTC-USD ) is now eyeing $29K, a level that was briefly exceeded on Wednesday, before retreating to as low as $27.74K. BTC's modest intraday upswing was buoyed by a stronger stock market in the wake of slowing inflation and a downtick in consumer sentiment . Overall, the token has had a robust month, on track to end the month 21.5% higher , as bullish sentiment surrounded the long-running lawsuit between the Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple, the company behind XRP ( XRP-USD ). ""Ripple may have sold unregistered securities, but the court may find XRP ( XRP-USD ) is not now a security and Ripple did not have fair notice of the law,"" said SA contributor John Miller .

42421077,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRfp,1680272029,"‘Rug Radio’ Founder Farokh Talks Fame, Fortune and Decentralization","Unlike other mononyms in crypto – like the single-named phenomenons Cobie, Loomdart and Hodlonaut – Farokh uses his real name. And he’s not exactly afraid if his reputation precedes him. The co-founder of ""Rug Radio,"" a Web3 podcast and media hub, has been famous before. He was a sensation on Tumblr and a massive presence on Instagram. However, it wasn’t until Web3 that Farokh Sarmad thought the celebrity that came with running a popular luxury lifestyle brand had much to do with who he is as a person.  “[I]t was never Farokh as an individual,"" that he was known for while famous in Web2, he said, adding it wasn't until the beginning of the crypto bull market that his personality – ""my name, my face and everything"" – became a calling card. And what does he think about fame? Well, some days are easier than others – but it comes with its own benefits, the Montreal-based influencer said. In particular is the hope that he can attract enough likeminded people to build something that becomes bigger than his own brand.  Identity, especially our digital doubles, is something the popular Web3 podcaster thinks about a lot. Before going full-bore into crypto, his day job was as a social media consultant through a company he founded, Goodlife Media & Communication (named after his first Tumblr). Then, during the heyday of non-fungible token (NFT) launches, Farokh took his time in developing what would eventually become the tokenomic scheme that would hold the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind Rug Radio together. He envisioned his creation as a “community of communities,” where anyone could join or start building a media brand, whether they held Bored Ape or Lazy Lion tokens.  Today, the network boasts over 50 creators and has fan bases scattered across the world. Farokh's own podcast has become a money-making template for others looking to go it alone in media, having attracted advertisers including fashion houses Lacoste and Givenchy and crypto mainstays Ledger and Uniswap.  See also: NFTs Are Securities and It's Great | Brian Frye – Opinion  CoinDesk caught up with Web3’s single-named media mogul ahead of Consensus – where he’s speaking on stage and planning a live Rug Radio broadcast – to hear Farokh's thoughts on what it takes to build a decentralized media ecosystem, how to deal with the pressures of celebrity and why Web3 communities are sometimes like religions. The conversation has been lightly edited.  Just to start off – are you planning anything special for Consensus?  Yeah, I'm doing a lot of Consensus stuff this year. I'm speaking on a panel on Wednesday about the power of community on one of the largest stages and then also presenting, for 45 minutes, a live ""Rug Radio"" episode with my co-host. It's gonna be fun.  So you used to be Tumblr famous. Is there a difference between the type of fame achieved on Web2 versus Web3?  I was big, really big, on Tumblr 10 years ago. On Instagram I was “famous,” but I was never personally big – I was always big via my pages, my blog. My blog was getting millions of impressions and my Instagram pages were doing quarter billion impressions a month, but it was never Farokh as an individual. It's really with Clubhouse and Twitter and Web3 spaces that me personally – like my name, my face and everything – was at the forefront of it.  Are we always who we say we are while we're online?  I think a lot of people aren't. But I think the people who remain relevant over time and who remain relevant have to be real. If you asked my friends if I was the same person on Twitter, digitally, as I am outside they’ll say I’m the same guy. If you put on a show every day, then you're gonna burn out and eventually it's going to seem fake. But the answer to your question is yes, a lot of people are trying too hard to be different and it rarely works.  Do you have a sense of what you want ""Rug Radio"" to grow into in 10 years?  The goal is to build a fully decentralized media ecosystem. Right now, decentralization is easy to throw around as a word. So at ""Rug Radio"" we preach progressive decentralization, meaning we aim to be decentralized over the span of five years. We're about 14 months in and it's working pretty well so far. In five years I really just want ""Rug Radio"" to be way bigger than I can ever be myself, and we're starting to hit that already. The idea is to empower creators and to allow people to own the narrative. In legacy media (let's call it that) creators don't actually own their own stories. Crypto changes the dynamics. I’m sure you guys [at CoinDesk] could relate.  I get it, but I'm not sure I can comment. Do you have insight into what building a unified brand in a decentralized manner actually would look like?  It's easy for a brand to go all sorts of ways when decentralized, right? What's important, and the way we've been doing it, is that you want to make sure that every step of the way, everything you build fits within a certain ethos. You don't want to set rules or else it's not decentralized, but that doesn’t mean you give yourself over to anarchy. You can set a set of morals and values, and you can start instilling them within your community step by step as you grow.  See also: Brands Will Save Crypto? Be Careful What You Wish For | Opinion  We're very big, we have dozens of different creators, 40-plus shows broadcasted in multiple languages on ""Rug Radio."" We have a Chinese community, a French community. I can't directly oversee the Chinese community because I don’t speak Mandarin, but what I can do is have my hands on its values to ensure the community self-regulates. All you can do is put the right people in place and empower the right people.  How has your approach to covering crypto, your messaging, changed in the bear market?  I’ve become even more convinced what we’re doing is correct. After all the blowouts, blowups and especially after FTX blew up, it made me even more bullish and genuinely curious about the powers of the blockchain, its technology and cryptocurrency. Call me a blockchain maximalist, but every issue we've had this past couple of years has been due to centralization.  Decrypt wrote two interesting profiles of you before and after you decided to launch a community token. It seemed like you were really deliberate in how you wanted to design it. Did you ask anyone from other projects, like someone you trust, for advice?  Ha, that’s the thing with ""Rug Radio"" – we’re not inspired by anything or anyone, per se, because we're really paving our own way. I feel like I have a flashlight in a dark cave, trying to find where to go, at all times. I feel like most of the founders in the Web3 space …  We decided to do a token after months and months and months of studying the space every single day, 16 hours a day. I've been doing media for over 10 years personally, so I understand how to build a community and social media in general. I understand mimetics, which is some of the most important parts of everything we're building. What I had to understand better was blockchain technology [and] DAO tokenization. But I’ve surrounded myself with good people, and of course we did everything with the help of the Syndicate DAO. [Will] Papper, the co-founder over there, is on top of everything tokenization. That's why I'm very confident about how our DAO and our infrastructure has been built – because it’s been built by competent people.  Is there anything you wish you knew in hindsight that you could offer as advice to people looking to launch a DAO?  I'm the type of person who approaches failures as things that are meant to be. It's part of being a young entrepreneur in a space that's young and growing quickly. I don’t think I would have done anything different, but there were times where I was trying to go too fast which didn't work out. My approach now, as of six to eight months ago, has been to slow down.  Live without regrets.  I try not to overdo it, but if you look back at your mistakes all the time to judge your whole life, then you're not going to get anywhere.  Talking about finding the right people – is there anything about Corey Van Lew’s [the artist who designed the ""Rug Radio"" NFT series] work that speaks to you in particular?  I'm a collector of his already. I love him. He's a very good friend of mine. I've known him for two years and some change. When I got into this space, he was one of the first people I met and we ended up with the type of relationship where we’d talk about anything – life and all it entails. Plus he listens to the show! One of our series is called the “Face of Web3,” because ""Rug Radio"" is the voice of Web3 – I think it came out really beautifully.  This is an open-ended question, but as someone who likes to be in control of their destiny, does any aspect of that mentality conflict with the aims of decentralization, of bending to the crowd so to speak?  Oh, that's the whole goal of building in Web3 … I think the answer to what you're asking is no, because I can still create my own destiny within ""Rug Radio"" just like anybody else. I'm just showing people how I can do it. I have no ego, and I actually want this to be something we built for everyone with everyone.  Is there anything you want to say about yourself that someone couldn’t find online?  Ha ha, I’m a picky eater. It’s a hard question because I say everything I think. I'm very transparent. One thing I would say is that I really care about everything – genuinely. Maybe that’s hard to get across online, because people assume things because “you're very big” and “you make money” and “you have a lot of followers.” But you know, I really f**king care.  Is fame all that it's cracked up to be?  Honestly, there's sometimes I wish I had none of it and some days where I tell myself you put yourself in this position so you may as well get the most out of it. It’s important to have good intentions. Live by good thoughts, good words, good deeds. It’s important not to start believing people’s worst perceptions of you. It's easy to complain, but there's a lot of upside.  There was a pretty funny line in the Decrypt article where you said that ""Rug Radio"" is a community for any cartoon animal – whether you’re an ape, a cat or an owl. I think that period of NFT history is pretty strange, honestly, and could never tell what “community” was supposed to mean in that context. Have your thoughts changed about what makes a digital tribe?  Digital identity, as a concept, has evolved. Definitely. And the way we express ourselves has evolved with different technologies. It gets on my nerves when people take it to extremes. We still get into the same modes of thought in the metaverse. We align ourselves with certain topics, and gather around people we relate to the most who are behind the ape, punk or cat. Just like in real life, some people will tend to float around people who have the same religious beliefs or have the same origins. In some sense, in digital spaces we’re trying to start a religion … maybe it’s something different.  See also: The New Ways of Making Money in the Metaverse  One of the secret reasons why it's called ""Rug Radio"" is not because we kept getting robbed or because I'm Persian … so Persian rugs. It's because when you build a home, you first put the rug on the floor and then you put the coffee table, couch and TV around it because it ties the room together. It’s infrastructure for everybody to be able to live. You know, you don't have to support a specific PFP [profile pic] or whatever to be part of it.

42421086,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRp7,1680268355,MetaBirkins Artist Mason Rothschild's Latest NFT Project Is 'Subject to Change',"Non-fungible token (NFT) artist Mason Rothschild has been keeping busy since his provocative MetaBirkins project pierced the cultural mainstream and grabbed headlines after Hermès filed a trademark lawsuit against the project.  The NFT collection of 100 furry digital handbags named after Hermès' signature Birkin handbag was released in December 2021 as a commentary on the fashion industry's embrace of alternative textiles. This raised the ire of the French luxury house, resulting in a years-long legal battle that challenged the limits of art and trademark law.  The 28-year-old artist told CoinDesk the lawsuit represented a battle not just over Web3 technologies but also over the future of art.  ""Just because it's an NFT doesn't mean it's not art,"" he said. ""An NFT is kind of the vessel and the artwork that it's attached to is the art.""  The jury ultimately ruled in Hermés' favor last month, though he and his legal team have appealed the decision and have pledged to continue the fight for artistic expression.  Dusting himself off, the Los Angeles native has continued to create art, curate fashion and advise brands in Web3. He continues to split his time between Terminal 27, a retail concept located in Los Angeles and Tokyo that he co-founded in 2020, and Gasoline, his creative studio and full-service Web3 branding agency he launched in 2021.  Gasoline's latest NFT collection, titled ""This Artwork Is Subject to Change,"" launched as an open edition on Manifold last month. Priced at an affordable 0.008 ETH (about $1.35 at the time), 10,987 dynamic NFTs were minted. Interest on secondary markets quickly picked up, and the project has a trading volume of 931 ETH (just under $1.7 million) so far. At the time of publishing, the collection's floor is at 0.04 ETH (about $72).  Fueling creative ideas  Rothschild has been stoking the proverbial fire since he created his artistic moniker over a decade ago. As a kid, he was ""deep into conspiracy theories,"" with both ""Mason"" and ""Rothschild"" referencing fringe conspiracies about secret societies and powerful people. ""I've literally been going by it since I was 11 or 12,"" he said, noting that he is in the process of legally changing his name to Mason Aston.  Over the past few years, Rothschild has expanded his creative endeavors and integrated NFTs into his artwork, often blending elements of design, realism and social commentary. ""Everything I do is kind of ironic or taking a jab at something,"" he said.  In January 2021, he founded Gasoline as a ""disruptive creative studio"" focused on Web3. His first NFT collection was titled ""Do Not Sit,"" and featured chairs that could not be used for sitting. His next NFT, the predecessor to the MetaBirkins project titled ""Baby Birkin,"" features a handbag with a fetus inside of it. It sold at auction for $47,000.  ""I knew that this was something that was going to be massive,"" he said of his move to create NFT art.  Gasoline has since expanded its offerings and has partnered with major brands on special projects. Last week, it announced a partnership with Ledger to produce a gold hardware wallet – the new ""gold standard"" for crypto, it claims.  According to Gasoline's recently released white paper, Gasoline plans to expand its ecosystem through partnerships with global brands, focusing on driving artistic value that allows Web2 brands to authentically enter Web3. This includes plans for NFT projects, memberships, physical activations and rewards.  ""In 2023, we are betting AGAINST 10k cartoon animal collections and betting ON art, access and onboarding some household names into the space with more than just a one and done drop,"" it reads, a dig at PFP collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club. According to the white paper, Gasoline already has over a dozen collaborations scheduled for this year and received ""close to seven figures in outside funding"" to start its business.  ""We do not have to rely on a community treasury, bolstered by royalties, to deliver,"" it reads. ""We believe Gasoline will create the new standard for what it means to be a part of an ""'NFT project.'""  Rothschild said this approach to NFT creation allows him to exert creative freedom over his projects and build out the Gasoline ecosystem while working with major brands to expand their intellectual property (IP).  ""When I see projects today, I see them kind of get a little stagnant when their only strength is their own IP,"" he explained. ""What our solution is ... we'll do about four projects a year, and [collectors] get access to all those. They'll all be in our voice. They'll all be in our style and level of quality.""  'This Artwork Is Subject to Change'  ""This Artwork Is Subject to Change"" (TAISTC) follows the same satirical, tongue-in-cheek structure of Rothschild's previous Gasoline projects. As its name suggests, the artwork attached to the NFT metadata is ""subject to change"" at any point. Rothschild told CoinDesk that the title also encompasses the ethos of what Gasoline is trying to do.  ""It plays into the whole ideology of what Gasoline is, which is constantly moving and evolving,"" he explained. ""We wanted to have a project that constantly spoke to whatever the meta was ... we change that maybe weekly or bi-weekly, depending on what's going on in the space.""  Taking inspiration from Jack Butcher's Checks VV and Opepen NFT projects, TAISTC deploys several interesting mechanics to differentiate its project from others in a way that feels fresh.  For one, the project plans to collaborate with several NFT artists to design its rotating artwork. Collectors have the option to ""freeze"" their NFT's metadata on an artwork that they like, resulting in a collection with evolving rarity that will reveal itself over time. However, users will not know which artist Gasoline has commissioned until the next artwork shift is made, shifting the focus to the art rather than the artist.  ""We wanted people to really judge how they felt about something truly based on the art and not based on who's behind it,"" Rothschild said. ""You always hear people say 'oh, we like the art' – yeah, right. You like it because people are hyping it up and it's pumping and the price is up.""  The project will also feature a burn mechanism that incentivizes holders to ""burn"" their NFTs to collect smaller and rarer monetary increments. This gamifies the collecting experience and will impact the project's overall supply over time.  The idea of ""burning"" assets has been visually represented by the project in its promotional materials showing wads of money being lit on fire. On a more ""meta"" level, Rothschild said the project serves as an introspective on the evolution of money and the human desire to chase it. ""If everyone is a millionaire, does it still feel special? It creates a race to adapt to the rapidly evolving value of the currency,"" the project states.  ""I wanted to speak to how cryptocurrencies are kind of displacing traditional fiat and how it's the future,"" Rothschild added.  In the future, Rothschild said TAISTC will continue to evolve as holders play with the collection's supply and artwork. He also teased that the collection will be used as a ""marketing opportunity"" to promote other projects that Gasoline is working on. ""Let's say we collaborate with a fashion company. We'll use the open edition and change [the art] to promote what's going on with that,"" he said. ""It's a massive tool for us.""  In Rothschild's view, the NFT world needs to continue to evolve to stay relevant and onboard new users into Web3. ""I think the best thing for Web3 is really to encompass access,"" he said. ""Rarely does humanity move backward when it comes to technology.""",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/03/31/metabirkins-artist-mason-rothschilds-latest-nft-project-ignites-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/808d72ebf99d87078f4f490bb367dcbe1ba6c491-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices     Top Stories  XRP has been the top-performing digital asset in March, gaining 39% as investors await court rulings in a case between the Securities Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs, which the U.S. argues issued the token (something Ripple disputes). The SEC sued Ripple in 2020, saying that it raised $1.3 billion in an allegedly unregistered securities offering. At issue is whether XRP is a security. Traders are anticipating a positive outcome for Ripple. Trading volume for XRP soared to billions of dollars on three of South Korea’s top exchanges on the back of the rally this month. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has gained 17% this month to put in on track for its best quarterly increase since 2021. Ether has risen 7.5% in March.  FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted bribery and campaign-finance violations unveiled in two recent superseding indictments during a court appearance on Thursday. Prosecutors unveiled the bribery charge on Tuesday, alleging Bankman-Fried tried using over $40 million in crypto to bribe at least one Chinese government official to unlock funds in accounts tied to Alameda Research, another one of his companies. The latest indictment came on top of an indictment unveiled last month that added bank fraud charges and detailed the campaign-finance allegations. Bankman-Fried was arrested last year in the Bahamas and extradited to the U.S., where he was released on bond. He is set to go to trial in New York this fall.  U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken said it will continue operating in Canada and complying with tougher rules set by the country’s financial regulator, the Canadian Securities Administrators. Kraken has filed a pre-registration application with the Ontario Securities Commission as it works toward becoming a registered “restricted dealer” across Canada, the company said in a press release on Thursday. Canada has tightened its rules governing crypto exchanges and set a deadline for crypto companies to commit to enhanced pre-registration requirements, causing some big firms to exit the country's market – OKX, Deribit and Blockchain.com among them – while others say they will remain. A restricted dealer in Canada is one that doesn’t fit into a category of other kinds of dealers, which are entities that trade securities for their own accounts or the accounts of others.

42421269,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmP7,1680262200,Web3 Should Be Built on Bitcoin,"A fundamental debate in the Bitcoin community has been reignited by the recent launch of Bitcoin Ordinals: to build or not to build on Bitcoin?  Creating new applications on Bitcoin presents an opportunity to leverage the most secure, resilient and liquid network to build Web3. From social networks to financial services, Web3 applications look to convert our most sensitive daily touch points into trustless systems. Eliminating centralized control means that the systems underlying Web3 applications must be as stable and ironically trustworthy as possible.  Alex Adelman is the CEO and co-founder of Lolli.  Bitcoin (BTC) has long been seen almost exclusively as a currency and store of value. However, the Bitcoin blockchain has proven, through over a decade of unfailingly solid and routine operations, that it is the most secure and economically viable blockchain network and therefore the ideal foundation for Web3. To neglect to build on Bitcoin would be to forsake key applications for the network that have the potential to make the internet, and the world at large, a better place.  Bitcoin’s unparalleled level of decentralization among other cryptocurrencies directly correlates to its resistance to tampering. Only an attack that seizes the computing power of 51% or more of the network could result in theft or reversed transactions. This would be borderline impossible due to the prohibitive cost of obtaining that much computational power.  Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency best positioned to lead the future of money and serve as a widespread medium of global commerce. Besides being the most decentralized, it is also the most liquid cryptocurrency at a current market cap of over $500 billion. It also has the strongest network effects; more people own bitcoin than any other cryptocurrency.  See also: Bitcoin Ordinals Custody Solutions Would Be Better if They Embraced Bitcoiner Values / Opinion  Building new applications on Bitcoin thereby allows the consequent applications – whether they are facilitating digital assets, decentralized finance (DeFi) or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) – to benefit from Bitcoin’s network effects, all while fueling further adoption of sound money. BTC’s liquidity, the highest of any cryptocurrency including ether (ETH), is particularly critical in decentralized finance, which runs on liquidity pools. The greater amount of liquidity a protocol has, the better suited it is to power financial use cases.  Bitcoin also has the distinct advantage of its senior, established position in the markets. Its level of security, scarcity and liquidity means that it will not be replaced by another currency as a store-of-value. In short, Bitcoin's theoretical value proposition – a hard monetary network designed to persist indefinitely – has been achieved.  Further, unliked other cryptocurrencies, BTC has also floated above enforcement actions from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory agencies – an edge that is at least in part due to its total and provable decentralization. People may speculate with BTC like they do with other cryptocurrencies, but there is no single entity that will benefit most from its adoption and use.  Why not Bitcoin?  Still, Ethereum has become the de facto choice for building Web3 applications, largely due to the fact that Ethereum can natively support the type of flexible smart contracts that Bitcoin cannot due to its limited programmability.  Contrary to popular belief, however, this aspect of Bitcoin’s design is a feature, not a bug, in facilitating decentralized finance and other Web3 applications. Bitcoin was built to support a high volume of sensitive, complex monetary transactions and so its subsequent level of security and stability makes it an ideal platform for building Web3 applications.  To date, Bitcoin has been chronically overlooked as a network for building new decentralized applications. As of late 2022, $35 billion of Ethereum’s $200 billion market cap was attributed to DeFi alone. By comparison, only $550 million of bitcoin’s $400 billion market cap has been put to work by the four major layer 2 Bitcoin scaling systems – Liquid, RSK, Lightning and Stacks – designed in part to run more complicated applications.  Ethereum also attracted the largest developer crypto ecosystem in 2022, 2.8 times larger than the next chain, with an estimated 5,819 developers compared to Bitcoin's 946. While Bitcoin tripled its monthly active developers in 2022, cryptocurrencies associated with blockchain Polygon, Polkadot and Solana grew fivefold in 2022, according to a much-cited Electric Capital report.  In this sense, the primary obstacle to applying Bitcoin’s power to broader Web3 applications is not technological, but cultural. In the Bitcoin community, resistance to innovation is commonplace, owing largely to a purist appreciation for Satoshi’s original mission for BTC to serve as peer-to-peer digital currency.  The Bitcoin community’s aversion to change and innovation has in many ways served as a boon to the network. Bitcoin developers and enthusiasts have obstinately preserved the core design of the network – such as the energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus algorithm and a fixed token supply – and thereby the integrity of the network.  However, protecting the network’s fundamental properties has, for some, become mutually exclusive with developing its potential. Bitcoin was created to be a payments system, but this does not mean that it should serve as money to the exclusion of all else.  Doing more with Bitcoin  Much like dollars are used to both produce and purchase goods, Bitcoin can be used both to generate digital goods and services and, in turn, purchase them. After all, money for all of history has been used to facilitate the creation of expressive, practical and usable goods.  While Bitcoin has lagged behind other protocols on smart contract development, it can easily surpass other protocols building decentralized applications given its inherent advantages – not to mention the new scalability potential created by the Taproot upgrade. However, this will require energized initiatives to build within the Bitcoin community, as well as a concerted effort to onboard builders into the ecosystem.  Building on Bitcoin as a base layer for DeFi, payments and non-fungible tokens (NFT) will catapult Bitcoin to even greater levels of visibility and adoption.  Leading companies including Starbucks, Amazon and Salesforce have all sought to establish ""Web3 strategies."" All have sought out protocols such as Ethereum and Polygon to help craft the backbone infrastructure for products that will reach billions of people and power adoption of the supporting cryptocurrency, including loyalty programs and NFTs.  While altcoin networks lack Bitcoin’s market dominance and level of decentralization, they boast a degree of investment in innovation to meet the needs of vast global consumer audiences. Yet, the possibilities of using Bitcoin to power Web3 are revolutionary. The Ordinals project, which has surged in adoption in a few months with over 400,000 Ordinals minted within a few short weeks, highlights the immense public appetite for digital assets on Bitcoin.  Other technologies such as zero-knowledge rollups (zk-rollups) on Bitcoin can also create powerful ways to settle global payments in BTC in a way that’s fast, free and energy-efficient. Zk-rollups, an experimental scaling model put to use on Ethereum, inherit blockchain's unique attributes like immutability and settlement assurance, and can play a key role in powering decentralized finance with bitcoin.  Web3 platforms built on Bitcoin would serve as a secure foundation to make financial services accessible to everyone in the world. In a Bitcoin-based Web3 future, everyone in the world with Wi-Fi would be connected through a complete digital and social economy powered by bitcoin as both currency and productive capital.  See also: Bitcoin Ordinals Can Lift the Entire Crypto Ecosystem / Opinion  Bitcoiners are already dreaming of ways to deploy Bitcoin apps to improve processes like election voting. Using smart contracts on Bitcoin to facilitate voting could end up providing more transparency and security, while reducing the opportunity costs of in-person voting and eliminating mistrust that plagues modern politics.  By not building beyond financial use cases, Bitcoin risks losing out to other protocols despite having the greatest head start. This anti-innovation sentiment will continue to discourage all but the most committed developers from building on the network, continuing to send talent to protocols like Ethereum where opportunities to build are more abundant and lucrative.  It is up to the Bitcoin community and its developers to mobilize to achieve this future, or risk leaving Bitcoin’s full potential unfulfilled.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MATIC,Alex Adelman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/31/web3-should-be-built-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c05806e69e08f3668e92403ba9350c782cb71d03-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The leading cryptocurrency by market value slipped by 1% to $27,546 during the European trading session, having failed to keep gains above $29,000 on Thursday, CoinDesk data shows. At 08:00 UTC, Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange by trading volume and open interest, settled bitcoin options worth over $4 billion.  ""The current price drop is more likely to be the impact of delivery and settlements and market makers selling their spot and contracts to maintain a delta neutral [market-neutral] book,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto-asset management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk.  Market makers provide liquidity by creating buy and sell orders and earn money through the bid-ask spread while maintaining a direction-neutral exposure. They are always on the opposite side of investors and often trade the underlying cryptocurrency in the spot market or buy or sell perpetual futures to balance their bullish/bearish exposure in the options market.  Circumstantial evidence validates Ardern's argument: Bitcoin dropped to $27,546 from $28,100 in the hour before 08:00 UTC. Deribit settled quarterly contracts at 08:00 UTC.  The chart tweeted by pseudonymous analyst @52kskew shows the cumulative volume delta, or CVD, in the Deribit-based perpetual futures market fell sharply into the negative before the settlement time. A positive and rising CVD means more buyers are in action, while a negative CVD implies sellers are aggressive.  Borrowed short?  The sale of borrowed WBTC, or shorting, may have played a supporting role in driving prices lower. WBTC is the largest wrapped version of bitcoin on Ethereum, the largest smart-contract blockchain, and can be swapped on a 1:1 basis for BTC.  The number of WBTC borrowed from the dominant decentralized lending protocol Aave rose to 3,220 BTC, a 29% increase in two weeks, according to data tracked by Swiss-based blockchain analytics firm Santiment.  Traders often express their bearish view on bitcoin by shorting WBTC tokens borrowed from decentralized-finance platforms like Aave.  ""Currently, we are seeing cautious borrowing of WBTC at this price range, nothing too insane yet, but it looks like folks have started to short,"" Santiment said in a market update.  The recent peaks in total WBTC borrowed from Aave have marked price bottoms in bitcoin.  ""Seems like the shorters on AAVE have a nice track record of being blown up.

Blockchain explorer data shows the Puppynet testnet has processed more than 700,000 transactions from almost 200,000 unique wallets after its launch on March 11. Much of that activity came in the past week, with more than 114,000 transactions over a 24-hour period on March 28-29.  While Puppynet's activity has been brisk so far, upcoming features may boost the value of SHIB and BONE, two Shibarium ecosystem tokens. There's still reason for caution, however.  ""Some might argue that the Shibarium upgrade’s financial impact has been underwhelming. But in our view, its beta test network Puppynet, reached an important milestone of 200,000 wallets in just over a week, and while continued work must be done, it’s still considered remarkable,"" Rachel Lin, CEO of SynFutures, a decentralized derivatives trading platform, said in a Telegram message.  ""Moreover, Unification, the firm behind Shibarium, announced that it is working on an all-in-one wallet solution that will enable native two-way asset transfers, staking/delegating, as well as include a ShibaSwap integration module. These developments suggest that the value of SHIB and BONE, the native token of the Shibarium network, could witness a near-term price spike, but given the current macroeconomic climate, any such movements will likely to be short-lived,"" Lin cautioned.  Testnets, such as Puppynet, are blockchain networks designed for testing purposes. They mimic activity on the mainnet and allow developers to debug any issues and monitor network activity ahead of a wider release.  Shibarium is touted as a major development for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which originally launched as a meme coin fashioned after the popular Shiba Inu dog breed but has since been a serious blockchain project.  Shibarium is a layer 2 blockchain, which refers to a set of off-chain systems (separate blockchains) built on top of layer 1 protocols that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data.  These networks bundle multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, which helps reduce the data load and fees on a main network.  As CoinDesk previously reported, Shiba Inu developers said Shibarium would focus on metaverse and gaming applications especially as the non-fungible-token sector is expected to heat up in the coming years, apart from Shibarium’s use as a cheap settlement for decentralized applications, or dapps, built on the network.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/31/shiba-inus-testnet-puppynet-sees-rising-activity-ahead-of-shibarium-mainnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57fc61d3ab939ceeca91f138a4f3b71c1cc59810-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

When deployed on other blockchains, EVMs can allow developers to build dapps and decentralized-finance applications similar to the way they would on the Ethereum blockchain.

42412473,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl50oQ,1680227070,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Hovers Around $28,000","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: The crypto market is ending the week flat.  Insights: Stefan Rust, CEO of data aggregator TruFlation, suggests that TradFi may be approaching a tipping point and that bitcoin may benefit.  Prices  By Sam Reynolds  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,213 −2.1 ▼ 0.2% Bitcoin (BTC) $28,303 −3.4 ▼ 0.0% Ethereum (ETH) $1,813 +28.2 ▲ 1.6% S&P 500  4,050.83 +23.0 ▲ 0.6% Gold  $1,998 +31.9 ▲ 1.6% Nikkei 225  27,782.93 −100.8 ▼ 0.4% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Both bitcoin and ether are opening the Asia business day fairly flat, with bitcoin flat at $28,303 and ether up 1.6% to $1,813.  Stock markets in Asia are in the green, with the Nikkei 225 opening 1%.  Bitcoin is likely dormant, and awaiting major economic news for its next move, because of low liquidity. As Kaiko noted earlier this week, bitcoin trading is at its lowest level in eight months after crypto exchange Binance reintroduced trading fees. This is on top of the existing liquidity woes bitcoin now faces, as fiat pipelines dry up.  Looking ahead to the next week there are a number of economic events that should spur traders’ interest.  John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , is scheduled to speak Friday afternoon U.S. time, along with Federal Reserve governors Lisa Cook and Christopher Waller later in the day. Traders often read the tea leaves from these engagements to see what’s coming ahead.  With the U.S. government taking an apparent stand against crypto, traders are no doubt looking to see if there’s anything that can disprove this and show that authorities plan to treat the asset class fairly.  Insights  Stefan Rust Has a Few Things to Say About Banks and Crypto  By James Rubin  Has crypto really, finally, truly reached its breakthrough moment?  Stefan Rust, a crypto investor and CEO of data aggregator TruFlation suggested that traditional finance may be approaching a tipping point amid multiple bank failures in the U.S. and near meltdowns at two banking giants in Switzerland and Germany, and that investor worries lie at the root of this week's surge in crypto prices.  “It seems people are realizing that the banking crisis isn't really over and, given all the noise out there, a lot of people are starting to question the approach that they're taking to their savings and wealth management,"" Rust wrote. ""I think many techprenuers and SVB clients will move some of their savings into crypto.  He added: ""Indeed, there already seems to be a demand to move some of this across into bitcoin and Ether on-chain, which could explain some of the recent price rises – especially as former SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) clients are receiving their savings back from the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.) right now.""  Rust noted that the collapse of crypto-friendly banks have eliminated valuable resources for investors and others eager to participate in the digital-asset ecosystem and alluded to rising regulatory pressures in the U.S. that may be creating obstacles to the industry's growth. ""Many are trying to navigate the on and offramp situation and find loopholes,"" he wrote.  The byproduct of this turn of events could benefit Hong Kong, whose leading financial regulatory agency, the Securities and Futures Commission, has recently proposed new, more crypto-friendly regulations. The SFC is seeking public comment on the rules, which could establish a new licensing regime for crypto service providers and allow licensed platforms to serve retail investors under certain protections.  ""A lot of Asian customers that had crypto in SVB are now moving funds to Hong Kong where they can set up accounts and use the Hong Kong banking system to on and off ramp,"" Rust wrote. ""Indeed, it's interesting to see that during these times, as the Western banking world is experiencing another crisis, that a small tax haven in China like Hong Kong is inviting crypto companies to work with them to identify new regulations that could be put in place to build a sustainable crypto economy.""  Rust expects the recent unsettled relationship between decentralized finance, or DeFi, and TradFi to steady. ""Over the long term, there will be a whole new on and offramp system between DeFi, crypto and the fiat world, as trust in centralized, regulated institutions has definitely had its back broken,"" he wrote. ""There is no longer a need to keep all your funds in one bank, one central entity that holds all of your assets in custody, as who knows what will happen with that entity and ultimately your savings.""  He added: ""Markets always take a bit of time to readjust, reacquire confidence and find new paths and funding streams. Money will always move uphill, however.”  Important events.

Grey spoke candidly about his feelings toward U.S. regulators and the general state of his industry to three other speakers during the first few minutes of the hour-long public meeting before community members trickled into the Discord call, which CoinDesk attended.  ""It really feels like over this last cycle that the majority of that feeling [of excitement] is gone now,"" Grey said. ""Look at what's going on on the regulatory side of things. Like this morning, Senator [Elizabeth] Warren [was] stating she's putting together an anti-crypto army to regulate the space into obedience.""  The comments come a week after Grey claimed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) served Grey and Sushi DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) with a subpoena as part of its sweeping efforts to reign in the sprawling cryptocurrency industry. Although Grey declined to share the details of the subpoena, it could signal the protocol is headed for a lengthy, and expensive, legal battle against regulators who have vowed to exercise more stringent oversight over crypto firms.  Read more: Sushi DAO, Key Contributor Served With SEC Subpoena  SushiSwap isn't like most crypto firms; the venue for trading tokens on the Ethereum blockchain operates via smart contracts – what's known as a DEX – not through the centralized servers seen at the likes of Coinbase or Binance. It is governed day-to-day by Grey and shaped by governance token holders who vote on proposals.  To fund the expected battle, Grey last week proposed the community reserve $4 million of the protocol's treasury funds for a ""Sushi DAO Legal Defense Fund."" The fund, which is almost as much as the DAO's annual operating expenses, received swift backlash on the community's Discord channels, becoming a sticking point on Thursday's call.  During the second half of the community call when attendees began to pour in, a community member asked Grey to provide more clarity on the subpoena. Grey declined to reveal any further details.  ""I've been advised by legal not to talk about subpoena in detail,"" Grey said. ""Just to say, 'Hey, you know, we've received one [and] we're cooperating with it,' and kind of leave it at that for now.""  Grey's answers seemed to appease the call's dozen or so attendees, one of whom apologized for broaching the subject of the subpoena. However, their silence during the meeting drew a stark contrast to the community's earlier, more abrasive efforts to rebuff the legal fund idea on the DAO's governance proposal forum.  Community members left more than a dozen comments questioning whether the legal defense initiative was a wise investment of the protocol's funds after the proposal was posted last week, with some even calling for Grey's resignation.  ""Post the subpoena, the community deserves to know,"" ChronoFury, a pseudonymous member of the DAO, wrote on the forum. ""Otherwise, how are we supposed to fund something we know nothing about?""  Roughly a third of respondents to a poll in the forum have so far voted against the fund.  'Bleeding funds'  Negative attitudes toward the legal defense fund have percolated among the community's members as the protocol tussles with its longstanding financial issues. In December, the protocol reduced the project's annual runway requirement from $9 million to $5 million. And, around the same time, Grey revealed SushiSwap had just less than 18 months of runway left in its treasury.  Grey acknowledged his efforts to address the protocol's financial issues during the first few minutes of the call.  ""All that we're doing now is just like to stem the bleeding that kind of has been occurring,"" said Grey.  News of the recent SEC investigation has hit the protocol's native token hard. It was trading at $1.21 before Grey revealed the existence of a subpoena; it has fallen 12% since.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/31/sushi-swap-ceo-says-he-no-longer-feels-inspired-amid-us-regulators-crypto-crackdown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2abea5614d53d19b477fa6b082bcf9c7cbe1e8a-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
