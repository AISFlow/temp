42376961,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vHah,1394576439,Luxembourg Opens Dialogue with Bitcoin Businesses in New Statement,"The Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), the government body responsible for financial regulation in Luxembourg, has issued a release detailing its treatment of digital currencies as well as its expectations for bitcoin businesses.  Issued on 14 February, the communique included familiar consumer protection warnings, but also featured a unique invitation for interested entrepreneurs.  The CSSF encouraged these individuals to contact its officials about facilitating digital currency-related commerce in the country, and suggested it will operate on a case-by-case basis with its regulatory decisions.  Read the statement:  ""Interested persons who would like to establish themselves in Luxembourg in order to carry out an activity of the financial sector [...] shall define their business purpose and their activity in a sufficiently concrete and precise manner to allow the CSSF to determine for which status they need to receive the ministerial authorisation.""  Michael Jackson, partner at Luxembourg-based Mangrove Capital Partners, spoke to CoinDesk about his conversations with Luxembourg's regulators, who he characterized as different from others around the globe due to their positive first response to regulation.  Said Jackson:  ""[They're saying] we're very open to people coming here and explaining their businesses. We don't have any problem with a bitcoin business, as long as it does what it's supposed to do and behaves properly.""  Research from the Law Library of Congress, corroborated by BitLegal, suggests this is the first time Luxembourg has issued any statements regarding the treatment of digital currencies.  CSSF breaks silence on bitcoin  Coming in at just one page, the communique nonetheless provided a broad overview of the CSSF's thinking on digital currencies.  The CSSF noted it does consider digital currencies to be money, as they are accepted as a means of payment by ""a sufficiently large group of people"". However, the CSSF did not define digital currency as legal tender.  The release went on to explain how digital currencies like bitcoin are different from other forms of electronic money, and reiterated concerns raised by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA) about their use. Though, notably it did not call for unique laws for bitcoin businesses.  Bitcoin in Luxembourg  Though not a native of the country himself, Jackson indicated that Luxembourg's bitcoin community has been in open dialogue with domestic regulators for some time.  Despite the positive statements, though, he stressed that the bitcoin community suffers a communication gap with regulators that has held back discussions, in Luxembourg and around the globe.  However, he sees this latest announcement as a step forward:  ""There are many different models, some people are running exchanges, some people are doing transaction processing, all sorts of things, and all of these different business models have different licensing regimes. So, the first thing that you're going to have to do is sit down.""  Domestic and global influence  Gary Cornelius, an admin for the Bitcoin Luxembourg Facebook group, suggested that the statements may not have much domestic impact, as the bitcoin business scene remains small. Coinmap indicates the local business community amounts to only a few bitcoin-accepting merchants.  Still, Jackson expressed optimism that Luxembourg's decision would carry weight in the broader European and global communities. He noted that Luxembourg's willingness to discuss the matter may resonate given that it is a financial center of Europe.  The statements come at a time when some in the EU, like France's Minister of Economy and Finance, are calling for broader cooperation on digital currency regulation.

42376955,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vHPN,1394573573,Dogecoin Foundation to Raise $50k for Kenya's Water Crisis,"UPDATE (17th March, 12:35 GMT): A $10,000 tweet, which many are calling 'the most valuable in history', has sent the Doge4Water fundraising campaign over its Ð40,000,000 goal using Twitter's dogecoin tip bot.    @tipdoge tip @Doge4water 14000000 may we all drink water. let the wealthy fill your cup. #savethemhood      — Hood (@savethemhood) March 16, 2014    ________________________________________________________________  The Dogecoin Foundation, the nonprofit entity created by dogecoin's founders, has announced that its next fundraiser aims to collect 40m dogecoin ($50,000) as part of a month-long effort to fund the creation of two water wells.  Held in support of World Water Day on 22nd March, the Dogecoin Foundation's latest project finds it teaming up with New York-based nonprofit charity: water to support a remote region in drought-stricken eastern Kenya.  As of press time, Doge4Water had raised 16.3m dogecoin, but according to fundraiser organiser Eric Nakagawa, the numbers shouldn't be the focal point of discussion. For him, the real mission is to raise as much money for the effort as possible, whether that means falling short, or smashing the goal.  Explained Nakagawa:  ""[It's a] super crazy goal. [...] If we don't hit the goal, it doesn't matter, if we can hit at least $20k, which I think is very, very likely, it will solve problems for hundreds of people.""  Though clean drinking water may at first seem like an odd goal given the foundation's more eccentric fundraising pursuits, Nakagawa indicated the dogecoin community has strong ties to water themes.  He noted that dogecoins have been spread through virtual fountains, faucets and water bowls that disseminate free coins to interested newcomers.  ""[The idea was] why don't we take the idea of a faucet and turn it into real faucets for people who actually need it.""  The Dogecoin Foundation has previously focused its efforts on supporting athletes intending to perform at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, most notably helping Jamaica's bobsleigh team attend the games with $30,000 in donations.  Partnering with charity:water  Nakagawa was quick to put the foundation's idea into action, and as charity: water's digital director Paull Young told CoinDesk, was just as blunt when it came to looking for in a partner.  ""We saw a tweet from Eric, he was like 'Hey Charity:Water, I want to try to raise $50k for you guys.' So, I said of course we're interested.""  Though Nakagawa also reached out to UNICEF with his proposal, he said the spark between charity: water and the Dogecoin Foundation was immediate.  ""The response I got from charity: water was so straightforward it was like 'Yeah we want to do it, here's how much it costs to do it' [...] 'We're ready to go'.""  Following the exchange, Nakagawa decided against his original idea: that both organisations would take part in the mission. Instead, once the dogecoin is raised, the Dogecoin Foundation will convert the dogecoin into USD and send it to charity: water as a cheque.  Choosing the recipients  Both Nakagawa and Young indicated that Kenya was an obvious choice given the extreme need in the area.  A video created by charity: water in 2013 documents the dire situation of one particular area, where the locals face wild animal attacks just to obtain polluted drinking water.    KENYA: Live Auction Video from charity: water on Vimeo.    According to American University's Global Majority E-Journal (pdf), Kenya has faced severe droughts as a result of climate change – a development that has been compounded by poor investment in water resources and a lack of access to clean water.  With two weeks remaining, Young is already thinking about accepting digital currencies for more of these types of big-picture issues.  ""We're looking at it from a financial/legal perspective. [...] We actively have people emailing us asking to donate bitcoin, dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies.""  The joke that keeps on giving  Nakagawa, a digital currency entrepreneur who had a past startup acquired by Ripple (and co-founded I Can Has Cheezburger), indicated that he sees promise in the ""joke currency"" due to its active user base that he believes lacks the hubris of other communities:  ""If you've been following bitcoin, litecoin and Ripple, you get burned out on the time spent on the trading price, and you start asking 'Is there more than this?' All we do is speculate.""  The San Francisco resident is hoping dogecoin becomes more strongly associated with nonprofit work in the long-term, and for now, is dedicated to furthering this goal. He added that the Dogecoin Foundation has already embraced the idea.  ""With dogecoin it's like 'Hey guys, let's make this part of our coin, let's try to do that all the time, because honestly the money is intangible it's as fictitious as fiat money,"" Nakagawa said. ""Turning that belief into something that's changing the world, it's part of the culture from the beginning.""  He suggested such outreach initiatives could happen monthly or quarterly, and that at the very least, this will be far from the last project led by the Dogecoin Foundation.

42376964,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vHfj,1394569384,"Dutch Streets Adopt Cryptocurrency, Become 'Bitcoin Boulevard'","It is the home of the Dutch royals, international war tribunals and, seasonally, to masses of photo-taking tourists, but the Hague in the Netherlands will soon be a hotspot for bitcoin enthusiasts, too.  At 17:57 on 20th March – the precise start of spring in the Netherlands – all of the businesses along two canal-side streets in the city centre will start to accept bitcoin.  In all, nine restaurants and one art gallery will take part in the scheme.  Unofficially the two streets running along the canal – Bierkade and Groenewegje – will also change their name to 'Bitcoin Boulevard'.  Hard sell  The city of the Hague has been quick to jump on the project with the tourism office promoting the event and the city’s 'Night Mayor' – the official who looks after the city's nighttime activities – due to make the first bitcoin purchase at one of the restaurants.  Hendrik Jan Hilbolling, one of the three organisers behind the project, says he had the idea for Bitcoin Boulevard after convincing his friend, who runs a restaurant on the street, to accept bitcoin for payments.  He discussed the idea with two other bitcoin enthusiasts, Peter Klasen and Henk van Tijen, at a bitcoin meetup. The three then set out to convince all the remaining restaurants to throw away their preconceived ideas, ignore the bad news spinning out of the Mt. Gox implosion and start accepting a cryptocurrency that some of them had not even heard of.  With some it was a hard sell, but one after the other the restaurant owners started seeing the advantages of bitcoin – such as the low transaction costs, the ease of payment for international guests and the promotional value.  As Hilbolling pointed out:  “In the end, who doesn’t want to be a part of a Bitcoin Boulevard?”  Bitcoin happy hour  Bitcoin enthusiasts won’t find it hard to spend their digital coins on the streets: there is a Michelin-star restaurant, a beer hall with more than 160 beers on offer, a café and a vegetarian restaurant.  The M Restaurant will also be holding a daily bitcoin 'happy hour', when all guests paying with the digital currency will receive a discount.  People with a bit of extra bitcoin in their wallets can also buy photography, paintings and sculptures from internationally known contemporary artists at the art gallery West.  At this stage, the restaurants and the gallery will not be using a merchant service. Rather they will display the QR code of their wallet on the bar and do simple bitcoin transactions from wallet to wallet. Hilbolling said, however, that this might change as the project develops.  Initially the idea was to conduct a two-month trial, but the businesses have said that if things go well they continue with the Bitcoin Boulevard concept indefinitely.  'Not just for nerds'  The three organisers, who all have day jobs in the software sector, said that they will themselves not make any profits from the project. Instead, it has been a way for them to spread the word about bitcoin, get to know other bitcoin enthusiasts, and introduce the digital currency to the general public.  Henk van Tijen explained:  “This event is is not just for nerds like ourselves, but for the regular moms and pops, kids and students. The purpose is to make it for a more broad audience.”  To boost bitcoin spending there will be a competition held for the person that spends the most crypto-coin on the street and for the restaurant that has taken the most bitcoin payments. Both winners will be displayed on the Netherlands' largest advertising screen, which sits over a highway near the city.  So, if you want to have your mugshot on display to Dutch commuters, load up your digital wallet and book a trip to the Hague. Michelin-starred food and international beer await you.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Jona Kallgren,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/11/dutch-streets-adopt-cryptocurrency-become-bitcoin-boulevard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36e991d6d1ca755c838f49d9fc6be647b96715c7-1182x770.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376968,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vHjV,1394566048,Pirate Treasure Resurfaces at Bitcoin's First Academic Workshop,"The first academic workshop to feature peer-reviewed research on bitcoin took place last week.  The 1st Workshop on Bitcoin Research (aka BITCOIN 14), which was held on 7th March, was part of a larger week-long conference, FC14.  The event was put on by the International Financial Cryptography Association, which has been organizing financial cryptography and data security conferences for the past 18 years.  Conference sponsors included Google, CA Technologies, WorldPay, Silent Circle and the US National Science Foundation. The Bitcoin Foundation also sponsored the event, fittingly providing its financial support to the conference in bitcoin. Many of the foundation's board members were also in attendance.  The conference took place on the island of Barbados, and of the 120 total FC14 conference attendees from all over the globe approximately 80 people participated in the BITCOIN’14 workshop.  History of academic interest in bitcoin  Scholars have been studying bitcoin for some time now. The first working papers were published as early as 2011, including a controversial article from scholars at the University College Dublin analyzing bitcoin anonymity.  FC14 was also not the first ‘FC-conference’ to include bitcoin research. Papers were presented at last year’s FC13 on transactions, exchange risk, user privacy and the FC12 conference also featured a paper from California-based researchers on how to make bitcoin better.  However, prior to FC14 there had not been another academic event featuring peer-reviewed research which was also fully-dedicated to the topic of bitcoin.  Ten academic papers in total were presented at the BITCOIN 14 workshop, and four additional bitcoin-related papers were also presented at the main FC14 conference.  It should be noted that the vast majority of academic scholarship to date on bitcoin has had a computer science/technology orientation. While academic economists have not shied away from discussing bitcoin, this debate has largely taken place on blogs and newspaper opinion pages.  Turing Award winner, meet Dread Pirate Roberts  One of the most high-profile papers presented at the conference was titled ""How Did Dread Pirate Roberts Acquire and Protect His Bitcoin Wealth?"" by Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir.  In 2002, Shamir shared the Turing Award, which is considered the Nobel prize of computer science, for his contributions to public-key cryptography through the invention of the widely-used cryptosystem RSA.  Both Ron, who delivered the workshop presentation, and Shamir hail from the Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.  Ron and Shamir previously published a paper analysing bitcoin transactions which showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins had never circulated; more recently they were at the centre of a subsequently disproven finding linking a bitcoin transaction between the Silk Road’s infamous Dread Pirate Roberts and Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  Ron and Shamir’s BITCOIN 14 paper on the bitcoin holdings of the Dread Pirate Roberts used block chain data to:  ""Trace the evolution of his holdings in order to find how he acquired and how he tried to hide them from the authorities […] and show that all his Silk Road commissions from the months of May, June and September 2013, along with numerous other amounts, were not seized by the FBI.""  Table 1 below summarizes all of the transactions by the Dread Pirate Roberts that Ron and Shamir’s analysis uncovered.  Based on their observations that the months of May, June and September show no earnings the authors conclude that it was likely that the Dread Pirate Roberts was using a different computer than the one seized by the FBI to store bitcoins earned from the Silk Road during these months.  The authors also note that based on estimates that the Silk Road marketplace generated sales revenue of more than 9.5m BTC with an average commission rate of 6.67%, that the Dread Pirate Roberts earned a total of approximately 633,000 BTC, or only one-third of the bitcoins identified by Ron and Shamir in Table 1.  In other words, the FBI only seized 22% of Dread Pirate Roberts' total bitcoin holdings.  The bigger you are, the more likely you’ll be 'DDoSed'  Another paper by Marie Vasek, Micah Thornton, and Tyler Moore of Southern Methodist University conducted an empirical analysis of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on operators in the bitcoin economy.  The authors note that DDoS attacks are:  ­  ""Inexpensive to carry out and quite disruptive. Competing services launch them in order to improve market share, traders target exchanges to buy or sell at favourable prices, and miners outgunned in the rush to increase computational power could try to cripple larger pools in order to increase their odds of solving the hash puzzle first.""  From May 2011 through October 2013, the researchers found 142 unique DDoS attacks on 40 different Bitcoin services. In total, 7% of all known operators in the Bitcoin economy have suffered DDoS attacks.  Overall, the services which are most commonly the targets of DDoS attacks are currency exchanges (40%), followed closely by mining pools (38%); DDoS attacks on gambling (9%), finance (6%), digital wallets (4%) and other services (3%) are far less common.  Empirical analysis shows that DDoS attacks on large mining pools, defined as those with historical hash rates equal to or greater than 5%, are much more likely to be attacked than smaller pools.  In a related paper which employs a game theoretic analysis to analyze mining pool DDoS attacks, Benjamin Johnson, Aron Laszka, Jens Grossklags, Marie Vasek, and Tyler Moore found that mining pools “have a greater incentive to attack large pools than small ones” and that overall “larger mining pools have a greater incentive to attack than smaller ones”.  Growing scholarly interest in bitcoin  Other papers at BITCOIN 14 covered bitcoin transaction analysis, legal and policy issues, network security, and ideas for improving digital currencies. A full list and link to each of these papers is presented below.  Many academics have found bitcoin’s open architecture and rich data set attractive for research purposes, and the significant presence of bitcoin research papers at last week’s conferences suggests that more and more scholars are catching on.

42376956,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vHUP,1394562370,New York Now Accepting Applications for Digital Currency Exchanges,"New York's Superintendent of Financial Services, Benjamin M. Lawsky, has issued a public order that confirms the state is now accepting applications for digital currency exchanges.  Perhaps most notably, however, was that Lawsky indicated that these businesses will be regulated under new New York regulation, which he committed to having in place by the end of the second quarter of 2014.  In his remarks, Lawsky struck his usual balance of at once recognizing the promise of digital currencies and stressing that related business activities need to be conducted in a responsible and lawful manner.  Wrote Lawsky in the release:  ""The recent problems at Mt. Gox and other firms further demonstrate the urgent need for stronger oversight of virtual currency exchanges, including robust standards for consumer protection, cyber security, and anti-money laundering compliance.  Proposal guidelines  Lawsky also disclosed new information for those seeking to apply for a New York-based exchange, indicating that interested firms can now immediately submit proposals and applications. However, he noted that such submissions represent a formal commitment to the regulatory process.  Further, Lawsky suggested that New York will not be bound by commitments that prevent it from taking what he considered appropriate action to safeguard consumers during this process. Lawsky noted that its policies for digital currency exchanges could be later modified to enhance consumer protection, cybersecurity or anti-money laundering initiatives.  Said Lawsky:  ""Turning a blind eye and failing to put in place guardrails for virtual currency firms while consumers use that product is simply not a tenable strategy for regulators.""  Approved applications will need to adhere to the regulatory framework New York plans to introduce later this year.  A long-awaited move  The move puts in motion an idea that first arose during the NYDFS bitcoin hearings in January. There, major digital currency investors made the case that New York should consider hosting such businesses, both for the job creation benefits and because the industry was in need of more oversight, though this suggestion has not been without criticism.  Major bitcoin business leaders had since hinted at dialogues with state regulators on the matter.

Just yesterday, Wales tweeted about bitcoin and indicated that he would discuss bitcoin acceptance with board members.  While Rascoff may seem pro-bitcoin now, he appeared on Bloomberg TV last November openly criticising the cryptocurrecy. He said:  “I am sceptical of bitcoin. I just think there’s too much shadiness associated with the currency that’s not maintained by some sort of government or central bank. And I think it will blow up at some point, with some big scandal where someone loses 50, a 100 million dollars, and I don’t think it [bitcoin] is going to be here in five years.”  Jill Simmons, spokesperson for Zillow, told CoinDesk that while Rascoff may be expressing interest in bitcoin, this doesn't necessarily mean his company is exploring bitcoin acceptance.

42376954,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vHRt,1394557047,US Securities Regulator FINRA Warns of Bitcoin's Investment Risks,"The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the largest independent regulator in the US, issued an investor alert about bitcoin on 11th March, calling the digital currency ""more than a bit risky"" as part of a new warning to consumers and investors.  FINRA said the alert aims to raise awareness about the downsides of bitcoin investments in light of the recent high-profile struggles of bitcoin business.  Read the release:  ""FINRA is issuing this alert to caution investors that buying and using digital currency such as bitcoin carry risks. Speculative trading in bitcoins carries significant risk. There is also the risk of fraud related to companies claiming to offer bitcoin payment platforms and other bitcoin-related products and services.""  In particular, the released noted the recent troubles of Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox and Imogo Mobile Technologies, which was suspended by the SEC following its introduction of a bitcoin payment platform in January.  Hacking, volatility top FINRA's listed risks  FINRA detailed what it referred to as the ""numerous risks"" associated with buying, selling and using bitcoin, including that bitcoin is not legal tender in the US.  The agency further emphasized how bitcoin is susceptible to fraud, saying:  ""Platforms that buy and sell bitcoins can be hacked, and some have failed. In addition, like the platforms themselves, digital wallets can be hacked. As a result, consumers can – and have – lost money.""  Additional comments covered how bitcoin exchanges are volatile and could close at any time, and that bitcoin transactions, by nature of their design, are not reversible like other popular forms of payment.  FINRA solicits tips and information  The announcements follows other notable statements from US policymakers, who have been increasingly outspoken about digital currencies, including US Senator Joe Manchin, top Alabama securities regulator Joe Borg and Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, as well as their intent to follow their progress.  FINRA, likewise, suggested it will be monitoring events in the digital currency space.

42376966,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vHgz,1394555967,MtGoxRecovery.com Seeks Reparation From Fallen Exchange,"The backlash from Mt. Gox's recent bankruptcy filings is now at full throttle, and a new website is building a case against the Japanese exchange with the goal of ultimately filing a lawsuit to recover damages.  MtGoxRecovery.com  has gathered information from over 1,600 customers who have lost funds in the aftermath of Mt. Gox filing for bankruptcy in both Japan and more recently in the US.  The website suggests that Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles' ""completely irresponsible actions"" have left many of the exchange's customers with considerable losses, and MtGoxRecovery.com hopes to recover these funds with the help of a Japanese law firm.  Widespread losses  In addition to the 850,000 bitcoins that have gone missing from Mt. Gox, Karpeles revealed the company has more than $60m in outstanding debt owed to creditors and customers.  At one time the industry's most popular exchange, Mt. Gox undoubtedly held a considerable number of bitcoins, and when the exchange halted withdrawals back in February, many worried that their funds would be forever tied up on Mt. Gox.  Message boards across the Internet have served as unofficial support groups for victims of Mt. Gox's apparent insolvency. On reddit, an entire subreddit (r/mtgoxinsolvency) dedicated to following the downfall of Mt. Gox has garnered over 200 subscribers, many of whom have reported significant bitcoin losses on the exchange.  One thread dedicated to sharing ""horror stories"" from Mt. Gox's bankruptcy was filled with anecdotes of loss:  Seeking justice  MtGoxRecovery.com was created by tech entrepreneur and Bitcoin Foundation lifetime member Olivier Janssens, who claims to have personally lost more than $5m as a result of Mt. Gox's questionable operations.  Janssens said he spoke directly with Karpeles in the months before Mt. Gox halted transactions and filed for bankruptcy, and stated in no uncertain terms that he believes Karpeles has acted criminally:  ""Mark knew I was a major stakeholder in the bitcoin community, and we discussed solutions for three hours to try to resolve this. At that time he kept telling me he could only send me a very limited amount per month, due to anti-money laundering issues. Obviously, this was a lie.""  One of the major concerns that Mt. Gox customers have consistently voiced is about the exchange's lack of transparency in its operations, particularly in recent weeks when Mt. Gox halted transactions and eventually filed for bankruptcy.  At this stage, however, there is no official evidence that Karpeles has acted illegally in any way.  Janssen pointed to the recent speculation surrounding the movement of $113m around the block chain and how many believe this money is linked with or even owned by Mt. Gox as evidence of Karpeles' unethical obfuscation of information.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Janssen said:  ""It’s very concerning to see assets moving [throughout the block chain] during civil rehabilitation. The legality of it is questionable to say the least, and it should not be done without clear communication to the creditors. Being completely transparent at this point is essential, and this is something that has been lacking at Mt. Gox since the beginning. People should not be given any false hope, nor should extra uncertainty be added.""  Building a case  Together with its lawyers in Japan, MtGoxRecovery.com claims it will file a lawsuit that will ""try to recover as much as possible, and additionally press criminal charges against Mark Karpeles personally.""  Janssen says that the website has gathered a substantial amount of information from users that have signed up as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, and in cases where the information is critically important, they plan to pass their case along to the police as well.  One area of focus for MtGoxRecovery.com and its users is Japanese bankruptcy law. Janssens plans to offer a public information session on the subject this week for users who have signed up on the website.  The time and date of this session is yet to be announced, but considering the large number of people who have lost bitcoin on Mt. Gox, the demand for more information is clearly substantial.

42376959,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vHYB,1394553013,"Mt. Gox's Chapter 15 Bankruptcy Won't Stop US Class Action, Lawyer Says","A US bankruptcy judge in Dallas, Texas, granted Mt. Gox's request for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection on 10th March, a move that will partly shield the troubled Japan-based bitcoin exchange's assets from creditors and block at least two lawsuits against the business.  While this may seem like a setback for those hoping to recoup lost funds from the exchange, Edelson law firm partner Chris Dore has suggested that the ruling only protects Mt. Gox KK, its Japan-based entity, from further action, not all of its associated legal entities.  Dore, whose firm is representing the US class action case against Mt. Gox, told CoinDesk the move does not cover other Mt. Gox entities such as Tibanne, its parent company; MtGox, Inc., its US entity; and CEO Mark Karpeles.  Dore said he will seek to move litigation forward against these defendants on behalf of his clients.  Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan on 28th February, citing outstanding debt of ¥6.5bn ($63.6m). The most recent US filing listed $37.7m in assets and $63.9m in liabilities.  Baker & McKenzie, the law firm representing Mt. Gox in the US, did not offer comment on the developments.  Mt. Gox mounts a defense  In sworn statements at the courthouse on Monday, Karpeles maintained that issues with the Bitcoin protocol contributed to the demise of his company. The comment is similar to past claims made by the CEO, ones which were roundly denounced by notable members of the bitcoin community.  Said Karpeles:  “The facts known to date indicate that it was caused or related to a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies Bitcoin, and ‘hacking’ attacks of one or more persons.""  The statement suggests that bitcoin's transaction malleability could be a continued line of defense for Mt. Gox as it looks to ward off criminal accusations.  Federal probe  Bloomberg reports that Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are allegedly currently investigating whether Mt. Gox and its associated legal entities may have committed any wrongdoing during the shutdown of the company.  The media outlet indicated that a representative for Bharara would not comment on the investigation.  A temporary restraining order hearing against Tibanne, Mt. Gox Inc. and Karpeles will be held today, according to Dore.  The next hearing in the developing case is set to take place on 1st April, when Mt. Gox will seek to extend its protection until its bankruptcy in Japan is resolved.

In fact, since nobody was actually keeping track, their one-million milestone came and went without anyone noticing and the current figure is much higher.  When the MultiBit team was recently asked how many downloads had occurred since launch, they crunched a few numbers to reveal that the wallet had in fact been downloaded a total of 1,517,000 times since April 2011. The team pointed out:  ""The figures have been adjusted down to take into account various DoS attacks and are based on the overall bandwidth attributed to the various installers rather than an arbitrary hit count, which is quite misleading.""  MultiBit also said that it does not have records from the early days when it was only used by the bitcoinj mailing list. However, the team believes that the download figures for this period were below 100 per month.  Version 2.0  The MultiBit development team is currently working hard on the next version of the wallet app, dubbed MultiBit HD.  MultiBit HD is designed for mainstream bitcoin users across the world, but there is still no word on the launch date, or which new features are to be integrated.  MultiBit is one of the few bitcoin wallets to feature support for multiple languages and, in its latest release, it supports more than 35.  The wallet is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux and is free to use – although it is 'donation ware', with the team suggesting a donation of 0.01 BTC from those who find it useful.  Ahead of the competition  Oddly enough, with 1.5m downloads, MultiBit seems to have shifted significantly more wallets than Blockchain.info and Coinbase, which both recently announced the passing of their one-million wallet milestones.  Both MultiBit and Blockchain.info saw a massive spike in the number of downloads in the second half of 2013.

42376934,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vEs7,1394542854,DC Veterans Jim Harper and Amy Weiss Join Bitcoin Foundation,"The Bitcoin Foundation has added two new high-profile members and experienced political operators to its team: Jim Harper and Amy Weiss.  Harper has been director of information policy studies for the libertarian Cato Institute for almost a decade, while Weiss is a former White House Deputy Press Secretary. She currently runs strategic communications firm Weiss Public Affairs.  Jim Harper will be the foundation's new Global Policy Counselhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/about/board and he will work to identify political impediments to bitcoin adoption. Harper has plenty of experience in the field, as he served as counsel to various committees in the US House of Representatives and the Senate.  During his time in Washington DC, he provided counsel on PayPal, VeriSign and other companies in the payments space. Jon Matonis, Bitcoin Foundation's executive director said:  ""Bitcoin is rapidly maturing and we are actively building out a world-class team of highly experienced professionals. Jim’s experience with Cato and past experience with PayPal in addition to Amy’s experience with the United Nations Foundation and the White House are invaluable to our efforts around the world and in DC.”  Building a voice  Harper said the Bitcoin Foundation is already a credible voice in Washington DC. He believes he can build on the foundation's success and improve global financial inclusion and strengthen financial privacy for law-abiding consumers.  ""The consensus policy that the foundation has produced – maximizing the benefits of Bitcoin while managing the risks – is something we’ll work to see governments around the world adopt,"" he added.  Amy Weiss will join the foundation's public affairs team and assist global communications and media efforts. In addition to her White House job under the Clinton administration, Weiss also worked for the Recording Industry Association of America, the United Nations Foundation and the Better World Campaign. “Bitcoin will soon be recognized as one of the most important economic and social innovations of our times,"" said Weiss, adding:  ""The Bitcoin protocol is poised to do for international commerce and financial services what the World Wide Web did for communications. Working with the Bitcoin Foundation during this exciting and formative time is a once in a lifetime opportunity.”  Weiss also served as the communications director at the Democratic National Committee and a press secretary for the Clinton/Gore campaign in 1992.  Interestingly, the Clinton administration was instrumental in the popularisation of another ground-breaking technology two decades ago. The administration worked to enact no-nonsense legislation which paved the way for the internet boom in the late nineties.  Bill Clinton was the first US President to send an email, while Al Gore became the subject of many a joke for his statements regarding internet legislation, which were used to imply that Gore claimed credit for creating the internet.  Gore is no longer active in politics, and it remains to be seen which US politicians will champion bitcoin's cause on the road ahead.

42376944,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vF3R,1394539715,Huobi CEO Addresses 'Fake' Trading Volume Rumours,"Rui Ma is an early-stage investor in technology companies with the global accelerator program and seed fund 500 Startups. Residing in Beijing, she is an active member of China's bitcoin community.    Some bitcoiners might still remember when BTC China was the dominant bitcoin exchange in China. Well, those days are long gone.  These days, newer exchanges Huobi and OKcoin regularly top the charts for trading volume. Monday, for example, their 24-hour volumes are at 106,942 and 126,973 respectively, third-place CHBTC is at 35,349, while BTC China lags far behind at 4,344.  Huobi, in particular, has garnered more international attention than OKcoin, perhaps due to its inclusion on the Bitcoinity.com charts and the grumblings that OKcoin juiced its trading data (an accusation that has been levied at Huobi as well).  Last Friday afternoon, I caught up with Leon (Lin) Li, the CEO and founder of Huobi, for some insight into why he thinks his platform has so quickly ascended the ranks of the Chinese exchanges, and to discuss his future plans for the company.  Huobi is a well-known name in China and Li is often interviewed there, but due to the fact that neither he nor his co-founder are particularly fluent in English, they are rarely featured in Western media, save for a few correspondences that he’s had with reporters over email.        Though I was introduced to Li a few months back, when the company was raising angel funding, Friday was my first time meeting him face-to-face. Li attended Tongji University as an undergraduate and Tsinghua University for his Masters, graduating sometime in 2007.  Both are top universities in China, with the latter being consistently the top-ranked engineering university in the country and the alma mater of a large number of influential Chinese internet entrepreneurs. His concentration was in electronics automation. He then worked for a few years in Oracle’s R&D department in China, and met co-founder Jun Du through friends.  Jun worked at Discuz!, an internet forum software company that was acquired by Tencent in 2010. Before starting Huobi, Li had taken a stab at both the social networking and group-buying business models, but, Huobi, it seems, is his first real venture of note. Li first got into bitcoin in mid-2011, but didn’t think of doing any business there until 2013.  He began development early that year, and raised angel funding from notable Chinese angel investment fund Zhen Fund (headed by celebrity superangel Xu Xiaoping) in Q3. Zhen Fund led the round, and was joined by Discuz! founder Zhikang Dai, who is now the General Manager of Tencent’s e-commerce business line.  They are also due to announce a large Series A funding, which Li tacitly acknowledged to be true, but refused to give any more details.  Trade volume questions  I immediately asked Li about the volume of bitcoin trades that are made on his exchange, which has been written about before and has been openly questioned by many in the community, both domestic and overseas.  Similar to previous conversations, he emphatically denied any faking of trading data, and noted once again that the zero-transaction fee structure of his platform makes it pointless to compare trading volumes against his competitors, particularly those who still charge a fee.  When I asked him to estimate how much the lack of fees might distort the trading volume, he said that he could easily see a “5-times increase” in trades because high-frequency traders can make profits off of much narrower spreads.  Instead of just volume, Li believes that customers should evaluate exchanges based on their liquidity, depth, and the size of the company. At least these are the metrics that he is measuring Huobi against competitors:  “We have been able to excel on all of these fronts, and coupled with our focus on marketing and customer service, we think that we will continue to give our competition a good run for their money.”  Why no fees?  So what is the reasoning behind Huobi’s commitment to a policy of “zero transaction fees, forever” on the platform?  “Zero transaction fees is the future,” Li said. According to him, the freemium business model is the new norm of the twenty-first century, and no industry, not even financial services, is safe from its disruption.  In fact, he says that there are now traditional securities brokers in China who have launched no-fee services, such as this one by Tencent and Sinolink Securities, and he predicts that in three years, the no-fees model will become the norm.  Basically, Li thinks that a platform will need to make its revenues from value-added services rather than trading, which he sees as a basic service and a commodity that should be free for consumers.  He was emphatic that even as Huobi expands internationally, they will continue to offer free trades. Speaking of international expansion, Li thinks that Huobi will be ready to launch into overseas markets sometime in the second half of this year, probably beginning with support for the US dollar markets.  Prior to this he will be focused on vertical expansion, and is gearing up to launch several of those value-added products he believes are the key to his business model. He’s ready to partner with bitcoin-related services that might benefit from being on his platform, and even offers to invest in promising startups as a strategic investor, either in bitcoin or fiat.  Office visit  When I visited Huobi's office, in the Shangdi area of Beijing’s Haidian district near tech giants Baidu and Lenovo, Li had just come back from a visit with senior bankers who also lecture at the PBC School of Finance at Tsinghua University, the premier institute of learning for China’s policy bankers.  The team was also getting ready to move into its new offices (just from one wing of the enormous office complex to another) as it had quickly grown to over 50 employees. Huobi prides itself on customer service – and now boasts over 20 customer service personnel.  When I asked Li how he was securing the Huobi platform against hackers and other attackers, he said that the team is extremely focused on security and is constantly monitoring potential loopholes in its systems.  He has third-party cybersecurity firms under contract, such as some of the ones listed here, constantly evaluating for potential breaches. Li says he would rather sacrifice some speed for better safety, as in the case of duplicate deposit and withdrawal requests, which the system automatically will prompt for human/manual verification. He also gets internal audits of their books at noon on a daily basis, weekends included, to make sure “everything balances.”  And of course, he only has 2% of Huobi’s funds in its 'hot wallet' and 98% in cold storage.  While this might mean that it might take longer for some users to retrieve bitcoins, Li would rather be safe than sorry. Li told me that things have “definitely cooled down” from the height of the bitcoin fervor in China in November 2013.  While he didn’t divulge the exact number, he did say that new user registrations are one-third of what they were four months ago. When I asked him what he thought the government’s future policies on bitcoin might be, he gave a laugh and said:  “You and I both know there is no point in guessing. The government will do what it will do, and it is impossible to predict. And you see too that other countries are also taking this wait-and-see approach.”  I would have to agree with him. There is no telling where the Chinese government will go with regards to cryptocurrencies, and at least for Huobi, whose ambitions reach far beyond Chinese borders, it may not matter that much.

This small, private company is a relatively big player in the casual gaming arena and is the publisher of the Mystery Case franchise and Big Fish Casino, along with over 3,000 casual games from more than 500 developers.  Although the company isn't as big as Zynga, it serves over 1,500,000 downloads a day and it has 700 employees.  Big Fish Games  allows users to try the games before they make the purchase and many of its games allow traders to buy and sell virtual items.  Cutting costs  While it may be smaller than Zynga, the bitcoin rollout announced by Big Fish is quite a bit more comprehensive.  Zynga limited bitcoin support to FarmVille 2 and a few other titles, while Big Fish plans to allow bitcoin payments for all 3,000 titles in its portfolio. Furthermore, consumers will be able to make in-game purchases with bitcoin.  This is what sets it apart from Zynga, as the rollout is not a test run, reports Venture Beat. Zynga also opted for BitPay over Coinbase as its payment processor of choice.  Big Fish Games' founder and Chief Executive Officer Paul Thelen pointed out that about 8% of the company's gross revenue is eaten up by transaction fees.  The integration of bitcoin payments is aimed to bring this figure down, as Coinbase demands no fee on the first $1m of transactions, and just 1% thereafter.  The fees are clearly a big deal, as the company generates half of its revenue through its e-commerce system. Big Fish netted $266m of revenue last year.  Enthusiastic employee  Oddly enough, it appears that the company's decision to look into bitcoin came about after a single employee started advocating for it. One of the company's engineers is apparently a bitcoin enthusiast and it appears that he made a rather good case for the digital currency.  As far as in-game purchases go, the rollout will apparently be limited to Big Fish Casino and a couple of other games for the time being. However, all the company's games will be available for purchase with bitcoin.  Interestingly, the company considered reinvesting the savings into bitcoin-related projects, but it eventually decided to stick to its core business and keep churning out casual games.

In addition, the Dublin cafe where Ireland's first ATM was due to be installed pulled out citing “complications” in hosting the machine.  BitVendo  , an Irish bitcoin ATM provider, had intended to launch their first ATM at Hippety’s Café this week, but have now relocated to a nearby electronics store GSM Solutions, where they had been testing the machine. BitVendo’s CEO Megan Dolan said:  ""We were only informed as we tried to install the machine. We were told staffing became a concern, it came as a massive shock to us, with no prior notice. We think there is a lot more to it, but can't expand.""  The sudden change of plan came alongside another blow as the Bank of Ireland told BitVendo they would not allow them to open an account. Dolan clarified:  “[The bank] informed me that: ‘Your account application has been rejected due to the nature of your business. We're not comfortable with it.’”  Up the ladder  Dolan says their business advisor at the Bank of Ireland claimed instructions came from on high.  CoinDesk contacted a representative from the bank, media relations manager Anne Mathews, who stated that the bank would not comment on individual interactions with customers or potential customers, but added:  ""It is Bank policy to assess each application on its own merit, taking a number of relevant criteria into account. In situations where we believe the potential customer does not meet the appropriate criteria it is our policy to decline the application.""  Alan Donohoe of the Irish Bitcoin Foundation, who has been working with Dolan, corroborated BitVendo’s version of events, claiming the business advisor said: “The people above me are rejecting the application due to the nature of [the] business.”  Donohoe said it was the first time he had encountered an Irish bank rejecting a business because it was involved with bitcoin and called on Irish banks to embrace, not reject bitcoin:  “We urge banks in Irelands to consider the future and how bitcoin can help the economy. Its not about competing with government currency, its about the technology and how it can spur growth.”  In tweets to BitVendo, the Allied Irish Banks, one of the “big four” in Ireland, said that in contrast to the Bank of Ireland they do allow bitcoin businesses to open accounts:    @BitVendo Hi, AIB does not transact directly in bitcoins as it's an unregulated currency; however, the bank does accept payments... 1/2      — Ask AIB (@AskAIB) March 10, 2014      @AskAIB Thanks for replying and giving us a straight answer on your position.

42376932,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vEoL,1394516095,Activist Takes Old-School Approach to Bitcoin Promotion,"There are plenty of videos and infographics online explaining what bitcoin is and how it works, but now, a bitcoin activist in the US is planning an old school approach to promoting it. Activist bitcoin-focused marketing agency Bitcoin Bigfoot plans to distribute 100,000 promotional packs to activists around the country. But why?  Paper wallets aside, bitcoin is an aggressively digital phenomenon. Coins are mined, not printed, and they are spent only by sending transactions across the decentralised electronic network. Yet Curtis Fenimore, who together with colleague Jake Tital founded Bitcoin Bigfoot this year, wants to engage new users using a trifold brochure.  ""The Internet has a huge reach, but it still doesn't reach everything,"" Fenimore says. ""There's still very much a need for face to face communication and physical promotional materials. YouTube videos alone can't do it. If that was true, adoption would be beyond the roof.""  Fenimore will target new bitcoin users; those who have heard of it but don't really understand it, and don't know how to get involved. The project was inspired by several meetings he had with such people, which would invariably end with them asking him how to get a wallet, followed by him scribbling URLs on the back of a napkin. There had to be a better way, he decided.  A grassroots effort  The brochure includes information about how to get and spend bitcoin, including links to large retailers who are now taking it. He will distribute it via regional bitcoin activists who ask for the leaflets in bulk. The brochures will include spaces for those activists to list local merchants taking bitcoin, in an attempt to spark grassroots support for the digital currency.  He has raised around 26 bitcoins, which he says should be enough to finish the design, printing, and distribution of the coins. A self-proclaimed ""bitcoin believer"", Fenimore is paying for as much of the project as possible directly in bitcoin. Only the postage will have to be paid in fiat, as sadly, Uncle Sam has elected not to take bitcoin payments for processing the mail.  [post-quote]  Distribution starts on April 1, and will run for 90 days, but this won't be the only production run. He will already be thinking about an update to the leaflet before the distribution phase ends, he says, because the bitcoin situation is changing so quickly. There will already be new merchants who should be included, for example. He hopes to have distributed 500,000 of the leaflets by the end of the year.  He hopes that by that time, bitcoin will have become mainstream and ""boring"" enough that at least one of the three major delivery companies in the US will be taking payment in it, enabling him to make the whole process fiat-free.  It's clear that Fenimore has high hopes for bitcoin, but then, he comes from a solidly libertarian background. He was an organiser of the Porcupine Freedom Festival, affiliated with the New Hampshire-based Free State Project, a libertarian-driven movement to gather 20,000 people in the state and create a society promoting limited government.  Fenimore's approach to bitcoin newbies differs from, say, Gareth MacLeod's Tinkercoin, which focuses on selling them bitcoins for a 25% markup. But Bitcoin Bigfoot will eventually be a for-profit concern, he hopes. He will begin selling bitcoin merchandise and promotional materials, producing it for clients at competitive rates.  ""The niche we'll carve out is bitcoin supporters and activists. Being known as the company that supports you guys,"" he says. ""If you have an idea of how we can help you and you can't do it on your own and it benefits others, then we'll try to make it available to everyone.""  Until then, however, he's relying on sponsors, and currently has 18 of them. CoinReport.net, Coinapult, expresscoin, DirectPool.net, LocalBitcoins.com, BIPS, KryptoKit, BitGo, Crypto Communications, and CoinMKT have thrown him some bitcoins, as have Let's Talk Bitcoin, CheapAir, Bitcoiniacs, CoinTrader.net, Bitcoin Buzz, Coinosphere, Coinality, and Bitcoin Magazine.  ""Bitcoin represents a paradigm shift on so many levels. We're living in the future and bitcoin is a taste of that,"" Fenimore says. ""I don't need to list for you all the benefits of it but all of those things are pointing towards a brighter tomorrow in which the value of what we use to trade is based on consensus and market rates.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/11/activist-takes-old-school-approach-to-bitcoin-promotion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88ec1f36d2362923a802b7c4e9b7b7f44d56d65a-1000x778.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
