42426186,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfVh,1416869995,Bullion Dealer Agora Commodities Will Rebrand to Focus on Bitcoin,"Precious metals dealer Agora Commodities has announced that it will rebrand to emphasize its increasing interest in digital currency.  The company expects to adopt the name Crypto Bullion Group, a process that will include the launch of a new online platform. Crypto Bullion Group will continue serving precious metals customers that want access to bitcoin.  The move continues Agora’s long-standing involvement in the digital currency industry, which in recent weeks has inspired the company to forge partnerships with other precious metals-focused startups like crypto 2.0-powered bitcoin-to-gold exchange DigitalTangible.  CEO Joseph Castillo told CoinDesk that rebranding affirms what he called the company’s growing focus on bitcoin. This process, he said, grew out of the grassroots support of customers and advocates.  Beyond rebranding to demonstrate what he called the company's ""philosophical grounding in bitcoin”, Castillo said that Crypto Bullion Group is actively moving to utilize the technology not just as a currency but as a mechanism for smart contracts and transactions.  He added:  “We’re committed to the idea of the implementation of bitcoin beyond just a source of revenue.”  According to the company, the platform is still underdevelopment, and while there is no set date in place, Crypto Bullion Group hopes to launch before the end of the year.  Focus on cryptocurrency  Castillo said that the rebranding will allow the company to provide a resource for precious metals collectors and investors who want access to bitcoin while, in turn, enabling broader adoption of the technology in general.  Commenting that many other companies are tapping bitcoin as ""just another revenue source"", Castillo said that an increased focus on digital currency would enable Agora to more directly support the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.  He told CoinDesk:  “Rebranding is just a reaffirmation to our commitment to bitcoin, and a thank you. This new technology has created wealth for us and a new service, and we just want to make that our focus.”  “Not that we are going to stop taking US dollars,” he added, referencing competitor Amagi Metals' expected transition to take place by 2017.  Interest in crypto 2.0 capabilities  Notably, Crypto Bullion Group is looking into advanced bitcoin protocol applications in the form of smart contracts. While this process is still in the conceptual stage, Castillo shared insights into how crypto 2.0 processes could be integrated into the precious metals business.  Castillo said that he and his team are looking at how the bitcoin blockchain can be leveraged to both build greater trust among investors and create decentralized contractual mechanisms that reduce costs and reinforce agreements through the use of bitcoin’s globally distributed ledger.  He cited the colored coins project as one concept his team is looking at, noting that a recent meeting with that development team was promising. Ultimately, the company’s goal is to build new tools to make their business run more efficiently, which he sees as a key promise in bitcoin itself.  “I don’t think people are looking at the protocol and thinking, wait a second, there’s more at work here. We can do many more things with it,” he said.

42426189,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfXh,1416862817,NCR Exec: Merchant Response to Bitcoin Eclipsed Apple Pay,"Bitcoin has been the most well-received alternative payment method that NCR Silver has added to its point-of-sale (POS) platform, according to product manager Reggie Kimble.  Speaking to CoinDesk about his company's new partnership with bitcoin merchant processor BitPay, Kimble suggested that the addition of bitcoin payments has so far garnered more attention than integrations for options such as Apple Pay and PayPal.  Kimble said:  ""When you look at our past alternative payment methods, I would say this has probably been the most well-received in terms of people commenting and people reaching out proactively to ask questions about the offering.""  NCR Silver added bitcoin payments on 10th November, allowing small merchants to enable the payment option at their mobile POS terminals. The company added Apple Pay support on 9th September and enabled PayPal support in January 2013.  Kimble called the reaction a surprising development, one that in turn allowed the more than 100-year-old POS terminal, ATM and payment kiosk provider to showcase how it is seeking to embrace payments innovation.  The product manager, who joined NCR in 2008, went on to state that NCR Silver aims to keep up with developments in the bitcoin space, adopting a ""watch-and-learn"" strategy.  Founded in 2012, NCR Silver is a subdivision of the NCR Small Business unit, functioning, according to Kimble, as a startup within the $6.1bn financial conglomerate.  NCR to attend Bitcoin Bowl  Kimble also revealed one specific event where NCR will be watching and learning about the bitcoin ecosystem: the Bitcoin St Petersburg Bowl, an annual NCAA college football playoff game, this year to be sponsored by BitPay.  Stating that NCR Silver is to be ""very involved"" in the event, Kimble cited the opportunity for such exposure as just one of the motivating factors that convinced NCR Silver it was time to offer bitcoin payments to its merchants.  ""We're going to have our POS solution in the stadium in their fanzone, accepting bitcoin for transactions,"" Kimble remarked. ""So, when we look at opportunities to co-market and support one of our partners, and you couple that with merchant and consumer demand, it becomes a priority on our end to get that development work done.""  Kimble also suggested that NCR Silver saw bitcoin as part of a larger trend for small merchants.  Specifically, he noted that the company's market research and business analyst team found that its customers were increasingly interested in bitcoin.  Guided by research  Prior to partnering with BitPay, Kimble indicated that NCR Silver had been monitoring bitcoin's development at a distance. However, once the company began to learn more, Kimble said his team became convinced accepting bitcoin was the right move for the brand.  In particular, Kimble cited recent research that suggests 70% of small business owners are interested in accepting bitcoin, but don't because their POS provider hasn't yet integrated the payment option.  ""The small business community is where our focus is,"" Kimble said.  Kimble indicated that NCR has not yet gathered enough data on the bitcoin transactions it so far has processed, though the company may look to issue these figures at a later date.

42426184,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfPh,1416855648,BitFury Adds Samsung Strategy Chief to Advisor Board,"BitFury has announced that president and chief strategy officer for Samsung Electronics Young Sohn has joined the company as an advisor.  Formed in September, BitFury's advisory board aims to assist the management and corporate development of the industrial bitcoin mining company. The board now includes Sohn, as well as semiconductor industry veteran Jackson Hu and former General Catalyst managing director Jonathan Teo.  In a statement, Sohn praised BitFury's team for its ability to deliver results in the difficult bitcoin mining market, but also suggested he sees that the company could soon expand its presence into other verticals where data centre expertise is in demand.  Sohn said:  ""The company’s commitment to delivering results through strong and consistent execution of its business and growth strategy has not only allowed BitFury to become a highly respected global bitcoin company, but to also see new opportunities.""  BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov echoed a similarly ambitious tone in his statements, choosing to emphasize the broad reach the company aims to achieve. In particular, he noted Sohn's ""extensive experience"" in semiconductors and consumer electronics as attributes that may allow BitFury to pursue development in these markets.  ""Young has served as CEO of four public companies. His experience in building and capitalizing companies will be invaluable to BitFury,"" the company said in a statement.  BitFury has raised $40m in VC funding to date this year, garnering $20m in separate rounds completed in May and October.  Fighting against Apple  Sohn adds a high-profile technology veteran to the BitFury team, one who is also no stranger to the world of startups and Silicon Valley.  Joining Samsung in August 2012, Sohn received the mandate to bolster Samsung's research and development (R&D) in response to increased competition from other smartphone makers, as well as the emphasis on innovation Apple was then bringing to market.  In particular, Sohn headed two Samsung R&D buildings in Silicon Valley and a startup accelerator. Though he carries the title of president, the company has at least three additional presidents listed on its website below its CEO.  A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and MIT, Sohn would go on to serve for 10 years at PC chipmaker Intel before working for Agilent Technologies and Quantum, among other companies.  Attracting expertise  Notably, Sohn is not the first major name that BitFury has added to its operations this year. The San Francisco-based company added Bob Dykes, who previously served as the CFO for Verifone, to its board of directors in September.  A payments industry veteran, Dykes has been outspoken about the potential he sees for BitFury to emerge as one of the bitcoin industry's major transaction processing companies.  2014 has so far been a year of impressive growth for the company, which manufacturers bitcoin mining equipment for the business-to-business (B2B) market and mines bitcoin for its own use through three data centres.  BitFury has promised to increase its foothold in the bitcoin market, even as it hints that it may soon diversify its operations. The company is expected to complete development of its 28nm ASIC chip, capable of achieving energy efficiency of 0.2 joules-per-gigahash, next year, while growing the capacity of its data centers to 100 megawatts, up from 40 megawatts today.

42426175,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjf5h,1416844512,Bitcoin Needs an Aggressive Legal Defense,"Across the board, bitcoin requires forceful and aggressive legal defense, not complicity with governments in crafting policy and regulations. It's going to get a lot rougher for bitcoin in the months and years ahead. We have to be prepared.  As Rick Falkvinge, author of Swarmwise, states, ""The copyright monopoly war wasn't the war, it was the tutorial mission. The Internet generation is using technology to assert its values and its place in society, the old industrial generation is pushing back hard against irrelevance. Things are about to get much worse.""  It is a superb analogy. Legal tender is essentially an unearned copyright privilege over the production of money. It is unlikely to be easily disrupted.  Only the naive can delude themselves into thinking that governments will embrace bitcoin in the name of monetary innovation or a modern techno-transition to the 'Internet of Things'. What government permits with one hand, it restricts and strangles with the other. Therefore, any regulatory gains by the bitcoin community are elusive, because they are designed to appease, while government enforcement actions reveal a contradictory agenda.  The real battle lies elsewhere, beyond the public policy debate.  There hasn't been a judicial test case for bitcoin legal issues yet, primarily because at least two candidates that got sufficiently close to a legal challenge elected to comply with authorities rather than risk the uncertain outcome of a test case.  On November 27, 2013, Mike Caldwell of Casascius Coins suspended the operations that made his branded coins the global standard for physical bitcoin rather than adopt a legal stand. While writing Bitcoin Ideology and Tale of Casascius Coins, I had the opportunity to consult with Caldwell and his attorney personally, so I fully understand their decision.  Also more recently, Las Vegas-based Robocoin capitulated to FinCEN pressure and started requiring all ATM operators to obtain customer information in an effort to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.  In my opinion, this was a missed opportunity to determine the legal categorization of a bitcoin vending machine and to set solid precedent. What if bitcoin vending machines dispensed only candy bars with 'paper wallet' wrappers or soda cans with removable wallet decals?  Recommended bitcoin legal areas for mounting a strong, concerted defense include: mandatory key disclosure, restrictions on freedom of transaction, attacks on bitcoin fungibility via blacklisting and whitelisting, and denying the principle of code as protected speech.  Mandatory key disclosure  Key disclosure laws  may become the single most important government tool in asset seizures and the war on money laundering. These refer to the ability of the government to demand that you surrender your private encryption keys that decrypt your data when charged with a criminal offense. If your data is currency, such as access control to various amounts of bitcoin on the blockchain, then you have surrendered your financial transaction history and potentially the value itself.  Jail time for refusing to comply with mandatory key disclosure hasn’t occurred in the US yet. But, it’s already happening in jurisdictions such as the UK, where a 33-year-old man was incarcerated for refusing to turn over his decryption keys and a youth was jailed for not disclosing a 50-character encryption password to authorities.  Key disclosure will become increasingly important in civil assets seizures, since Kim Dotcom's pretrial legal funds would have been safe with bitcoin.  It is very likely that a significant key disclosure case will make it to the US Supreme Court, where it is far from certain that the Fifth Amendment privilege, as it relates to a refusal to decrypt bitcoin assets, will be universally upheld.  Freedom of transaction  In support of an individual's freedom to transact without requiring a license to operate a 'money services business', the Bitcoin Foundation filedhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/07/amicus-brief-in-florida-state-case/ an amicus brief in a Florida state criminal case tied to alleged bitcoin transactions. In that case, an individual faces one count of being an unauthorized money transmitter under state law and two counts of money laundering.  The charges against the individual were filed in March 2014 and it is the first known state criminal case involving the alleged buying and selling of bitcoin. Another defendant was arrested at the same time based on similar alleged conduct and has been separately charged. This Florida case has received wide-spread media attention, such as from Bloomberg.  The foundation’s amicus brief supports the individual defendant’s motion to dismiss the count charging him with being an unauthorized money transmitter based on the core position that state prosecutors are improperly applying Florida statutes regulating 'money services businesses' to individuals conducting peer-to-peer sales of bitcoin.  This case is a big deal because it specifically targets high-dollar-value transactions and prosecutions like these could shut down one of the last remaining avenues for purchasing bitcoin anonymously.  Denying an individual's freedom to transact violates freedom of choice in currency, which is similar to an outright ban on bitcoin. In a ban, government authorities prohibit pricing or use of a currency other than the nation's 'official' currency, as witnessed in Bolivia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Bangladesh and Russia.  The ban in Bangladesh extended to even informing or educating others about bitcoin, prompting the nonprofit and educational Bitcoin Foundation Bangladesh to suspend operations temporarily.  In a slightly more positive development this month, Russia’s Ministry of Finance reduced potential fines facing both individual and institutional bitcoin users who create, issue or promote digital currencies.  The draft bill, which still seeks to outlaw the use of 'money surrogates' like bitcoin, decreases penalties for individuals to 50,000 rubles ($1,050) from 60,000 ($1,314). Legal entities would now face a maximum fine of 500,000 rubles ($10,781) for this action, down from 1m rubles ($21,563).  Fungibility  Fungibility  refers to the concept that every unit or subunit remains equivalent and identical to any other unit or subunit. It is the property of a good or commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution.  Fungibility is a complex issue, because it can be described in economic terms, cryptographic terms and policy-based terms.  Hashcash inventor Adam Back states that cryptographic fungibility is stronger than policy-based fungibility. Cryptocurrency expert Jonathan Levin replies that there is actually no cryptographic fungibility in bitcoin and that the best suggestion of this is simultaneous creation and destruction. Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, a computer security specialist, asserts that policy-based fungibility ends at the jurisdictional border.  While bitcoin public addresses do have a traceable history, the sub-unit components that make up a single bitcoin transaction do not have unique identifiers, such as the serial numbers on paper bank notes. Since individual transactions are able to be broken apart, each component unit can only be traced realistically to its creating miner. This complicates reliable ownership and thus provides an element of plausible deniability for the entire infrastructure.  I maintain that the US Marshal Service's first, and now second sale, of seized bitcoin demonstrates current fungibility at least in the US jurisdiction. Just as the government doesn't spend confiscated dollars at a discount, they don't sell 'tainted' bitcoin at a discount and, furthermore, none of the offered coins are blacklisted or whitelisted. A commercial precedent has been set.  Varying tax treatments for bitcoin may have an impact on bitcoin fungibility within certain geographic areas, however. Also, read what a landmark legal case from mid-1700s Scotland tells us about monetary fungibility.  As governments attempt to steer bitcoin deployment to small and microtransactions and wholesale payment networks become politicized, the issue of international fungibility looms large, because large cross-border and permission-less value transfers may become bitcoin's sweet spot. Now, that's a sweet spot for a strong legal defense too.  Code as speech  Transmitting a bitcoin message to the network blockchain is the same as sending an encrypted, private email message and, as such, is protected under the First Amendment to the US Constitution. This important principle extends to both the development and usage of the code.  For the last 24 years, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has been at the forefront of defending civil liberties in the digital age, championing user privacy and free expression. Activism director Rainey Reitman's brilliant editorial opposing New York's proposed 'BitLicense' scheme is a powerful declaration of privacy rights.  ""Digital currencies such as bitcoin strengthen privacy and are resistant to censorship. We should consider this a feature, not a bug,"" Reitman said in a statement.  The EFF also defended MIT student bitcoin developers in a New Jersey court to oppose a subpoena issued over their prize-winning bitcoin mining program. The program known as Tidbit was designed to serve as an alternative to viewing online advertising by allowing website users to help mine bitcoins for the site they're visiting instead.  In a move that could strengthen bitcoin-related privacy, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky recently introduced a bill to extend Fourth Amendment protections to include electronic communications.  Also, anticipating potential Fourth Amendment-related challenges, the Bitcoin Foundation's global policy counsel Jim Harper compared New York's BitLicense regulation to an inspection of an entrepreneur's garage:  ""The comprehensive financial surveillance that the 'BitLicense' proposal requires at proposed sections 200.12(a)(1) and 200.15 is unwarranted, and the Department has put forth no evidence or argument that it is calibrated to cost-effectively achieve any public interest goal. Requiring businesses to maintain detailed surveillance of their customers anticipating later law enforcement seizure is itself a constructive seizure, which is unconstitutional under a proper interpretation of the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution.""  Now, if India had Fourth Amendment protections, egregious office raids, such as the ones carried out last December against two bitcoin exchanges, could have been effectively challenged. India may need to seek out alternative avenues for defense.  The way forward  I am hopeful that with criminal defense and trial attorney Brian Klein more closely associated with the Bitcoin Foundation, other defense attorneys will be encouraged to engage with the bitcoin community, domestically and internationally.  Taking a principled stand in Bangladeshhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/09/the-case-for-bitcoin-in-bangladesh/, for instance, will send a strong message to the entire world. When it comes to impact litigation, the EFF cannot do it all. We should view this as an opportunity for bitcoin advocacy groups to grow a backbone.  Follow the author on Twitter.

42426191,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfdh,1416836211,Analysis: Around 70% of Bitcoins Unspent for Six Months or More,"UPDATE (16:30 BST 24th November): Updated with additional comment from Tim Swanson.      As many as 70% of all bitcoins in circulation have not moved in at least six months, according to data provided by Reddit user John Ratcliff.  Ratcliff, a principal engineer at NVIDIA who in his spare time uses 3D tools to visualize blockchain analytics, published the new charts to provide the community with a better idea of how and when bitcoins have moved in recent months.  Describing one of the charts, he said:  ""This graph shows, I believe, a reasonable measure of 'liquidity', in other words a measure of all bitcoins in existence, how many move each day, week, month, etc.""  An analysis of the charts by cryptocurrency author and enthusiast Tim Swanson indicates that many bitcoins were bought during the late-2013 bubble, which peaked roughly a year ago, and are still unspent – presumably while their owners await a hike in price.  Swanson also points out a ""sobering"" trend: although the number of merchants accepting bitcoin has increased fourfold this year, blockchain activity is not seeing a corresponding increase.  Bubble buyers holding on to their coins  Swanson explains that bitcoin movement correlates with a rapid increase in market prices, namely in April 2013 and November 2013. The substantial price drop following the 2013 bubble caused a reduction in blockchain movement and a majority of bitcoins are simply inactive.  Swanson finds the lack of movement in bitcoins bought at the top of the market particularly intriguing:  ""What is especially interesting is to see the 'overhang' or rather the 'underwater' coins that are moving from the three months to the six- to 12-month band. What this effectively shows is that owners of those [bitcoins] purchased them during the bubble of November-December 2013 and are still willing to wait and hold onto these coins until the price rebounds.""  Swanson predicts that lack of upward movement in prices will eventually force the owners of these coins to sell them sometime in the spring of 2015.  Monthly liquidity is still hovering around the 10% mark and Swanson argues that Blockchain's transaction volume chart is no longer valid due to increased advertisement spam, mixing, mining rewards and a range of other factors.  Pseudoanonymity makes analysis challenging  Swanson told CoinDesk that the pseudonymous nature of the blockchain prevents exact analysis.  ""We cannot know for sure exactly when someone paid for a UTXO but if the self-reported numbers from exchanges during the November-January time frame are correct, based on the moving mass on John's chart there could be upwards of one million coins whose owners are effectively underwater and are waiting until a rebound,"" said Swanson.  Swanson said if the if the 2004-2007 mortgage overhang is used as a facsimile, some owners can and will hold onto an asset as long as they can before realizing market losses (eg, selling).  He explained what could cause this behaviour:  ""Some can wait indefinitely because it represented a minority of their portfolio. From its December peak, market prices have declined globally around 65% as of today and thus these theoretical ""underwater"" speculators could exist at many points along this curve including as recently as four months ago, when market prices were 50% higher than they are today. Perhaps prices will eventually rebound and these UTXOs will move once again, this is an area for future traffic analysis.""  The true cost of bitcoin security  The problem with such low volumes is that the sheer cost of maintaining the network amounts to 3,600 bitcoins every day, which effectively pays for security.  Swanson argues that the ratio of mined and processed coins, which is close to 1:2, means that a ""massive security overkill"" is still taking place – a situation that is analogous to ""every other mall patron ... effectively being guarded by a mall cop"".  Stressing that network transaction fees would have to increase by several orders of magnitude to replace the current mining incentive approach, Swanson concluded that holding or hoarding coins is understandable, but also problematic for a modern currency.  Miners currently have to spend the bulk of freshly mined coins within weeks in order to sustain their operations, hence they inject thousands of new coins on the market each day.  Merchants battling for limited coins  Another conclusion, Swanson says, is that the increase in the number of merchants willing to accept bitcoin has not translated to increased use of the digital currency on the part of consumers.  ""Despite the near quadrupling of merchants that now accept bitcoin as payments (this past year increased from ~20k in January to ~76k through September), on-chain activity has not seen a corresponding increase by consumers,"" he said. ""They are all effectively fighting for the same thin slice of liquid coins, a segment which empirically has not grown.""  Swanson concludes that payment processors collectively process 5,000-6,000 BTC on any given day, with the caveat that some additional activity could be taking place off-blockchain in trusted third parties.  In May, Swanson penned a CoinDesk feature, analysing blockchain trends and elaborating on why such analyses can be daunting (and inaccurate due to external factors that must be compensated for).  In the feature, he also stated that very little on-chain growth can be witnessed, as most of the growth is coming from 'trust-me silos' and in many cases trades were the result of security measures rather than commercial activity.

42426182,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfJh,1416827150,Markets Weekly: Could Central Banks Spark a Bitcoin Rally?,"Following mid-November's price spike, the bitcoin markets have resumed regular service. The price has dropped slightly, while trading volumes have reverted to more commonly observed levels.  The price started last week at $385, according to the CoinDesk BPI, and closed the week at $366 – a fall of 5%.  Trading volumes fell precipitously by 39% last week compared to a week earlier. The number of coins that changed hands across all exchanges tracked by Bitcoinity stood at 3.68 million – down from 5.99 million over the previous seven days.  Last week's giddy heights  The declining price and decreased trading activity last week is in stark contrast to the previous week's bidding frenzy. The price then achieved a high of $458 on 13th November.  Market watchers salivated as they anticipated a price breakout. The Nasdaq's resident blogger Martin Tillier, who has plenty of experience in the forex markets, advocated a bullish interpretation of the upswing. He pointed out that the Dollar Index had achieved a one-month peak, thus was due to decline. This meant that bitcoin traded against the dollar would gain in value.  ""That could well be the short squeeze to end them all,"" Tillier wrote in his column last week, predicting that a breakout would take the price back up to $450 and beyond.  It was not to be, however. Instead, the bitcoin price has reverted to trading in the $350-$370 band, putting paid to hopes that last week's rally was the start of a new bull market.  Tillier's analysis remains optimistic, even in this trading band. In the less optimistic scenario where the price doesn't rocket, he wrote:  ""Breaking that [downward trend] depends on establishing a new pattern of higher lows and higher highs. If BTC/USD holds above the $350 point ... it clears the way for that pattern to take hold.""  Could central banks boost the bitcoin price?  The bitcoin price may obtain succour from an unexpected source in coming days: China's central bank. Even more incredibly, the central banks of Japan and Korea are also helping to pile upward pressure on the bitcoin price.  It's not that East Asia's central bankers have decided on self-obsolescence, en masse. They're doing something more predictable – firing the opening shots of what's widely seen as a new currency war in the region.  It all started when the Bank of Japan cut interest rates unexpectedly at the end of October, helping to push the price of the yen down, relative to the US dollar. This move boosted its exports.  Now Japan's competitors, Korea and China, have followed suit. The People's Bank of China announced rate cuts last week, apparently to check the price of the renminbi relative to the yen.  As Nasdaq's Tillier has pointed out, it helps to look at both sides of a currency pair, even if you are a bitcoin obsessive.  Bitcoin-yuan trading accounted for 76% of trading volume in the last six months, according to Bitcoinity. If the yuan is going to get cheaper, then bitcoin grows in value.  Of course, the usual caveats about BTC/CNY trading volumes from the major exchanges dealing in that pair apply. While the trading volume figures are likely amplified as a result of their no-fees trading model, it's not often that bitcoin bulls can celebrate the monetary policy moves of central banks.  US Marshals worry bitcoin markets... again  Possibly pulling the price in the opposite direction, however, the US Marshals Service (USMS) has announced an auction of 50,000 bitcoins that belonged to accused Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht in December.  The agency is using the same format as the July auction of 30,000 coins that was won by venture capitalist Tim Draper.  Is another auction going to help or hinder the bitcoin price? Let's review what happened in the July auction. The run-up to the bid submission deadline saw the price rise gradually, from $444 on 18th May to $579 on 26th June. The auction took place on 27th June.  Rumours swirled in the following days, as the USMS began a slow drip of information about the auction. On 1st July, the agency said the coins were won by a single bidder – Draper as it turned out, who outed himself the following day.  Bitcoin markets appeared distinctly nonplussed by Draper's unveiling, if the price is any indicator. The price hovered in the $600s for much of the month, only to begin a steep downward decline in August. That slide hasn't really stopped since.  So another auction – this time with two-thirds more coins on offer – may not be the sort of news traders hoping for a much-needed rally want to hear. Tim Draper has announced that he will bid this time too.

42426179,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfFh,1416807970,Australian Senate Hearings into Digital Currencies to Start Wednesday,"The Australian Senate will hold its first hearing into cryptocurrencies this Wednesday morning (local time) from 08:30–12:30, as part of the Digital Currency Inquiry (DCI).  Representing the international community at the hearing will be Perianne Boring of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), the trade association which has made a name for itself lobbying to educate and promote digital currency issues among US policy makers.  A live audio/video feed of proceedings will be available on the parliament's website, and the Senate has invited members of the public to submit their own questions via twitter (using hashtags #AusPolDCI, #DCIQA) for a special Q&A panel session featuring all witnesses from 11:30–12:30.  Local industry's chance to speak  The Senate Economics Committee, chaired by senator Sam Dastyari, has organized a number of other witnesses representing local and international interest groups to speak on a variety of regulatory, security and entrepreneurial issues.  They include futurist, tech entrepreneur and virtual reality pioneer Mark Pesce and senior lawyer Andrew Sommer.  Representing Australia's bitcoin industry will be Bitcoin Brisbane founder Lucas Cullen, chairman of the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) and Bit Trade Australia CEO Ron Tucker, and ABA Technology CEO and bitcoin ATM operator Chris Guzowski.  Regulation, economic impact and innovation  The inquiry  's terms of reference state that the digital currency world will be examined with particular regard to developing an effective regulatory system.  Such regulation would hopefully find the most appropriate definition of digital currencies for tax purposes, promote competition and growth in the industry, ensure ongoing financial industry (both traditional and digital) stability, protect consumers and secure against illegal activity, and incorporate digital currencies into Australia's national security framework.  In addition, it will examine digital currency's impact on the Australian economy, particularly the payments, retail and banking sectors, and determine how Australia might take advantage of such technology to establish itself as a market leader in the field.  Wednesday's hearing is the first chance to raise potential issues for the inquiry to address before it closes submissions on Friday 28th November. According to a statement, further hearings are expected in Sydney and Canberra in February 2015.
