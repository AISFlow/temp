42403153,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf4lK,1565820051,Walmart Files Patent for Blockchain-Backed Drone Communication,"Walmart has reasserted its interest in blockchain-backed drones with a recent patent application.  The commerce giant filed for an application entitled ""Cloning Drones Using Blockchain"" in January 2019 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office publishing the patent on August 1. The patent for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) blockchain-based coordination system was published the same day as Walmart's digital currency patent application.  The application is not Walmart's first foray into blockchain-backed drone tech. In 2017, Walmart sought a patent for a blockchain-based drone package delivery system, among other applications.  According to the patent, blockchain technology is used to transmit information, like drone identification numbers, flight heights, flight speeds, flight routes, battery information, or loading capacity, to other drones. Information can be shared based on the intermediate location between drones.  The benefit of blockchain technology, the patent claims, lies in data integrity:  ""A blockchain ledger may store any kind of information that may be stored in any other format or medium, for example, a large list of instructions of different types, navigational information, and maps. In such a way, a same software profile may be deployed across the cloned drones.""  The application joins a host of other UAV applications by the commerce giant with most describing a delivery service of sorts.  Image via Patentscope  Coordination and communication are also listed as valuable uses. By encrypting data on a decentralized ledger, operational parameters can be executed without fear of being compromised.  Patent application publishing and patent issuance are not the same, however. The patent applications is the first step in a long application process.  Wal-Mart's interest in blockchain technology caught most by surprise earlier this month with a patent publishing for a cryptocurrency not unlike Facebook’s Libra.

42403155,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf4nI,1565818236,"Despite CEO Claims, Dash Isn’t Really the 'Most Used' Crypto in Venezuela","UPDATE (15, August 12:55 UTC): A previous version of this article suggested that 80% of Venezuela's merchants used dash in 2018. Instead, we now understand that the Dash Merchant project signed up 80% of the businesses that accepted dash in Venezuela.  Further, Ryan Taylor's position is CEO of Dash Core Group, not of Dashpay    ---------    “Dash is the most used cryptocurrency in Venezuela,” said Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core Group, as he stood on stage last May during CoinDesk's Consensus event.  This statement has been repeated time and again by Dashpay, hinting that crypto is taking off in Venezuela's economy.  But after investigating the true uptake of the crypto in Venezuela, this statement - while bold - isn't quite true.  In 2018, over 2,400 businesses in Venezuela reportedly accepted dash.  Nowadays, the usage is expected to fall following its first audit by Discover Dash, according to Ernesto Contreras, Business Development Manager for Dash Latin America.  “They will complete their first audit to registered businesses this week and the total of retailers affiliated to Dash is going to fall,” Contreras said.  Indeed, local sources told CoinDesk that only a small number of projects and merchants are actually using dash. For example, Fabiana Arreaza, owner of the startupChiringuitos, told CoinDesk that customers rarely use the crypto payments option.  “We’ve been accepting dash for two years. We currently haven’t received any clients using dash to pay for their events. They'd rather use bolivares or dollars,"" she said.  This is true for the wider crypto industry in the country. There are approximately 488 businesses, including many small food startups, that accept cryptocurrency payments in Venezuela, though few businesses actually see traction.  Image: dashcentral.org  Los Costilla, a popular, dash-friendly restaurant, is one example. A representative told CoinDesk they haven't accepted any type of cryptocurrency for over a year.  ""The photo was taken over a year ago, when we did accept the payments with the cryptocurrency. Since then we haven't accepted dash. We don't accept any kind of bitcoin,"" said the restaurant.  Dash Dynamic  Huge Dash billboards can be seen in the main streets of Caracas, and Dash has even given outcellphones with integrated wallets to boost adoption in the country as part of their well-known marketing scheme.  “We are surrounded by Dash publicity,” said Venezuelan bitcoin user Isabel Pérez.  But it’s not just shoppers that are being marketed to. Perez recalls how the project Dash Merchant offered Venezuelan retailers on-boarding services.  In one marketing push, the Dash Merchant project collaborated with Dash Venezuela’s “Ciudad Dash” event to recruit affiliated merchants and give $10 worth of dash to attendees.  The results fell flat.  “I’ve asked a couple retailers that accept dash if they accept crypto, but they don’t,” Perez said.  This creates a scenario where users who want to experiment with dash rarely move beyond the first few transactions.  When speaking of this marketing campaign to onboard new merchants, Dash Development Manager, Contreras,tweeted:  “I think that working with so many businesses was too complex. I know that in this last months there have been quality campaigns and updated the training.”  On the other hand, the Merchant project made strong headway in growing adoption in Venezuela before shutting down after the team showed inconsistencies in theirsalary reports.  “Dash Merchant made the majority of business connections so far”, he said.  But he also said the growth of the dash community in-country happens mostly outside of the official network. According to Contreras, only 4 out of 27 Dash related projects in Venezuela are financed by theDash DAO.  Approximate Figures  So far, CoinDesk have found scant evidence to support claims that dash is the most widely used cryptocurrency in Venezuela.  There are an estimated 10,000 active Dash wallets in Venezuela but local experts say this may be incorrect. The actual number of downloads on Android is managed by Dash Engineering Solutions and it doesn't offer a complete picture of the platform, according to Giorgio Marinetti, CEO ofDash Help.  ""We only work with approximate figures. Those numbers are taken from payment processors of different Dash projects, along with its use in events. Our data is mainly from daily interactions with businesses and startups,"" Marinetti said.  The real growth statistics for the dash market in Venezuela remains an enigma for the Dash team on the ground, making it impossible to compare with other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.  ""We can only calculate an approximate number of transactions in the country. We don't have a central point of data, so we have to collect it ourselves,"" Marinetti said.

42403148,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf4gP,1565816109,New IRS Warning Letters Target Crypto Investors Who Misreported Trades,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is sending another round of warning letters to cryptocurrency users, this time to taxpayers it believes to have misreported income from exchange transactions.  In addition to the three letters sent last month to crypto traders advising them they may have incorrectly filed their taxes, the IRS is now also telling certain investors that they did, in fact, report the wrong amount of income from crypto transactions. And the agency is looking to collect.  According to one letter shared with CoinDesk, a taxpayer owed nearly $4,000 for the 2017 tax year. This taxpayer owed more than $3,600 in taxes alone, with another $200 or so in interest accrued.  The letter was dated July 29, 2019.  Chandan Lodha, co-founder of tax software provider CoinTracker, told CoinDesk that the IRS has been sending these so-called CP2000 notices to some customers, indicating they are potentially on the hook for revenue they did not report.  ""The IRS is sending out these other notices and those are kind of like warning letters of varying degrees of how threatened they were,"" Lodha said of the earlier three letters. But the ""CP2000 is a slightly different letter.""  He went on:  ""Basically what it says is 'hey we have a report from one of the financial institutions you use and the amount they reported to us the IRS is different than the amount you, the taxpayer, reported and this is the amount you owe' and it’s a 30-day letter meaning you have to respond in 30 days.""  The CP2000 letter has been used outside of the cryptocurrency space for other forms of unreported income, Lodha said. However, “it’s definitely a new phenomenon that’s starting” in the crypto space.  Lodha added that transfers from an exchange into another wallet shouldn’t be a taxable event, but an exchange may still report it as such.  Paper chase  Justin Woodward, a co-founder and attorney with tax calculator startup TaxBit, told CoinDesk that he’s seen more of these letters starting in August.  According to the IRS website, a recipient of the letter should respond regardless of whether they agree with the tax assessment or not. Those who disagree with the assessment should ask their financial institution to send a corrected statement.  Lodha added:  ""In terms of how the actual dynamic works, first they send you the CP2000, they send the proposed amount due and you say 'yes, I'll pay that' or 'no, and here's the supporting documentation.'""  According to the letter shared with CoinDesk, the recipient reported $0 in income from crypto transactions to the IRS in the 2017 tax year. However, information through Coinbase indicated the recipient should have reported more than $12,000 in income.  Neither the IRS nor Coinbase immediately responded to requests for comment Wednesday.  It is possible that such discrepancies come from how exchanges are reporting transactions.  Woodward said this likely comes from the exchanges issuing 1099-K forms, rather than 1099-B forms. Because 1099-K forms are typically used to report income for merchants, most transactions would be reported as revenue, rather than any losses that may have occurred.  Aaron Cohen, who received one such letter, confirmed that the IRS based its estimation of his tax burden on a 1099-K which dramatically overestimated how much he made on his trades.  ""I’m not sure if it’s a lack of understanding from the IRS or if they’re just blindly sending out these letters hoping people are too scared [or] too lazy to look at the letter and say 'hey they made $13,000' when they didn’t make $13,000,"" he said.  He worked with CoinTracker to estimate a more accurate total on capital gains, which he plans to report to the IRS, he said.  “People that have received a 1099-K from an exchange but have not filed an IRS 8949 in the 2017 tax year are the ones that we’re seeing received the most letters and who this is typically applying to right now,"" Woodward said.  In such cases, ""we’ve been sending letters back that outline the deficiencies in 1099-Ks … and we’ve helped [traders] and with the proper 8949,"" Woodward said.  He described how filing the merchant form could lead to a trader receiving the CP2000, saying:  ""The amounts on the form, what they're doing is if I make a trade for $100,000 on a platform, I buy 1 bitcoin for $100,000 and I sell it a couple weeks later for $90,000 I could have a $10,000 loss but I have a 1099-K that says I received $90,000.""  The IRS is expected to issue new guidance on crypto taxes in the near future, updating the last official guidance issued in 2014. It is unclear what the agency might say, though outstanding questions include how to deal with hard forks and airdrops.

42403145,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf4bU,1565812847,Nevada Crypto ATM Operators Now Require Money Transmission License,"Nevada's regulatory stance on cryptocurrency kiosks has shifted, now requiring a state money transmission license.  Speaking with CoinDesk, BitAML Senior Advisor Annelise Strader said Nevada abruptly and without announcement changed its regulatory stance on cryptocurrency kiosks.  Following the last legislation session closing in May without passing a proposed cryptocurrency bill, Strader says the state’s regulatory team changed its interpretation of what constituted a money transmitter within the state. Kiosks must be licensed by the state and will require a surety bond requirement.  Priced at $5,000 per kiosk, surety bonds are paid to the state as an insurance mechanism for customers against business failure.  Strader first spoke with the state regulator on behalf of a BitAML customer caught in the red tape. Months followed before an answer was given, Strader said.  Following up with the Nevada Division of Financial Institutions, state regulator Julie Hanivold said they were waiting on the cryptocurrency regulation bill to pass before taking action. The regulator began reviewing the matter one year ago. With the bill failing to pass, the regulator self-determined to reinterpret current statutes concerning state money transmissions.  Under the new interpretation, any transfer of value--money, credit, virtual currency, or other--falls under the license. Businesses and proprietors must apply and complete a checklist to obtain a license. Included in the list is a surety bond requirement of $10,00 upfront plus $5,000 for each location. Bond requirements max out at $250,000.  Hanivold said all requirements are publicly posted on the state's websitehttps://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-671.html but they have no future plans of issuing a press release on the matter. The regulator does plan on calling back a dozen or so businesses that have inquired over the past year.  Paraphrasing her conversation with Hanivold and confirmed by CoinDesk, Hanivold said: “We’re not going to go hunting and penalizing any kiosks, but six months down the road if any action hasn’t been taken, [we will begin notifying owners.]""  Image via CoinDesk archives",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | SPONSORED,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/14/nevada-crypto-atm-operators-now-require-money-transmission-license,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac681b36c8b748cb88d59f86ba963d396e6e8408-1000x600.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403143,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf4aV,1565802006,Coinbase Is Using an Ethereum Upgrade to Help Merchants Accept USDC,"Coinbase Commerce is putting ethereum’s most recent upgrade, Constantinople, to use for thousands of retailers and merchants around the world.      Launched early last year, Coinbase Commerce is an app for online vendors wanting to accept payments in crypto and integrate these purchases into existing business cash flows.      As reported by CoinDesk in May, over $50 million in transactions have been processed through Coinbase Commerce by 2,000 merchant clients, including e-commerce giant Shopify.      Recently, the application added support for ethereum-based stablecoin USDC. On Wednesday, Coinbase Commerce software engineer Bojan Joveski released a blog post discussing the new ethereum feature that makes USDC payments possible.      “CREATE2 is very recent addition to the ethereum ecosystem and it’s very important because it enables workflows that were impossible or at least very impractical before,” said Joveski. “Now, developers can simulate interactions with the blockchain without deploying their [smart] contracts on there.”      Joveski added:      “This is very neat because it enables huge savings for cost.”              CREATE2 was activated on the ethereum blockchain in February as part of a larger systemwide upgrade known as Constantinople.      According to Joveski, the implications of his report suggest a cost-effective and secure way for Coinbase Commerce to support virtually any ethereum-based ERC-20 token, not just USDC. What’s more, it’s not only payments on the ethereum blockchain that Joveski suspects can benefit from the CREATE2 feature.      “The same structure of how we architected these smart contracts can be used for a number of uses cases that go beyond payments,” said Joveski. “Any interaction where some service provider needs to eagerly offer some items for sale or tokens related to gaming they can re-apply the same principles we’ve used here.”    How CREATE2 works    Originally proposed by the founder of ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1014, or “CREATE2,” adds a new operation code enabling developers to deploy a smart contract on ethereum in the future tense.      Rather than committing every interaction to a smart contract on the blockchain, CREATE2 allows for what Hubert Ritzdorf, CTO of smart-contract audit firm Chain Security, calls “deterministic deployment.”      “When you deploy a new smart contract on ethereum, what happens is that [the network] computes the address to where the contract will be deployed. You know this ahead of time but it depends on a lot of variables,” Ritzdorf told CoinDesk in February. “CREATE2 makes it easier to say, ‘We will deploy in the future a contract to this particular address.’”      As such, on Coinbase Commerce, smart contracts facilitating the payment and receipt of USDC tokens only have to interact and pay fees to the ethereum blockchain for final settlement. Initial smart-contract interactions such as address confirmations happen off-chain thanks to CREATE2, according to Joveski.      “Without CREATE2 … we would need to deploy to the blockchain in order to show you the address you can pay to,” said Joveski, adding:      “[With CREATE2] I can show you an address that doesn’t exist on the blockchain but that you can pay to.”              This not only saves Coinbase Commerce on gas costs but also, as Joveski highlights, discourages the initiation of fake payments since these are only committed to the blockchain upon final settlement.      For now, initiating payments of USDC on Coinbase Commerce is free for all customers. This may change into a paid feature, according to a Coinbase representative, once smart-contract-based payments on the application are sufficiently streamlined.      This being the first design and deployment by Coinbase of a commercial payments system on ethereum, Joveski said:      “What is novel about this is that the ethereum ecosystem is releasing all these new features. This is essentially one of the first tries to use those features and build a secure [payments] system on the platform.”            Brian Armstrong image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | USDC,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/14/coinbase-is-using-an-ethereum-upgrade-to-help-merchants-accept-usdc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23a1a29dbcd3fd05ff51d267bda06c5a2969f374-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403149,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf4fQ,1565800257,Terra Signs Music Streaming Platform to Crypto Payments Alliance,"Terra  has added another partner to its payment provider alliance.  The Singapore-based, South Korean-focused blockchain provider and stable coin issuer has agreed to work with Bugs, a South Korean music streaming service. Bugs is the latest addition to the Terra Alliance, a group of ecommerce companies for which Terra provides payment services.  Terra now has 25 partners in the grouping, including some of the largest ecommerce players in the region, and has ambitions to become the PayPal of Asia or even the next Alipay.  The latest partnership will allow Bugs customers to pay for their song purchases using Terra. The company says that the arrangement is the first of its kind between a major music streaming service and a blockchain payments platform.  Bugs, which has 5.8 million songs available for users, was founded in 2002. Formerly known as Neowiz, it was acquired by NHN Entertainment in 2015. The company is listed on the Kosdaq, South Korea's secondary market, with NHN owning about 45% of the shares.  The arrangement between Bugs and Terra will utilize CHAI, a Korean payments solution provider that has a mobile app for completing transactions. CHAI will be the public face, while Terra will provide the backend blockchain technologies.  ""The value chain for payments is convoluted,"" said Daniel Shin, co-founder of Terra. ""There are six or seven players, and everyone takes a cut. We streamline the process.""  The relationship with CHAI is central to Terra's strategy, as is the Alliance the company is building. Shin wants crypto be usable and used and believes that the best way to achieve that is to have the front end be simple and intuitive and to give the consumer many ready options for spending. The power of the blockchain and the coin are kept mainly in the background.  ""For crypto to be a currency, it needs to be widely accepted for exchange. I don't think bitcoin fits that definition of a currency,"" Shin argues. ""We give consumers access to everything they consume, one partner in each vertical. Obviously, music is one.""  Terra, as Terraform Labs, is a Singapore company with a strong interest in Southeast Asia, but it has a clear Korean connection and a clear Korea strategy. But like many companies with strong links to the country, it has been begun to work overseas in part because of domestic regulations that have made developing local crypto all but impossible.  ""I think Korea has the opportunity to lead globally, but the lawmakers have not given clarity. Everything is murky and uncertain. Giving clarity will be helpful for the sector,"" Shin said.  He noted that in countries like the US, if something is not illegal, it can be done. In Korea, if it is not explicitly legal, it should not even be attempted. The government must give clear consent or nothing happens. So far, the signals have been mixed, and the areas open for business have been limited. But Shin has noticed some movement in this respect with the growing understanding on the part of the authorities that crypto is needed.  ""Before, it was crypto 'no', blockchain 'yes',"" he said. ""Now it is more like blockchain 'yes', private crypto 'yes', public and listed crypto 'no'.""

42403147,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf4eR,1565794825,"Meet FumbleChain, the Deliberately Flawed Blockchain","FumbleChain makes breaking blockchains a sport.  Demonstrated for the first time last Thursday at the Black Hat infosec event, the deliberately flawed technology is meant to act as an educational tool for crypto developers.  “Basically, this what people call CTF, or ‘capture the flag,’” explained Nils Amiet, a senior security engineer at Kudelski and one of the developers behind the project. “Whenever you solve a challenge, that is when you get the flag. … The challenges are pretty technical.”  Through these curated and gamified challenges, the aim is to teach users about the complexities of blockchain technology.  According to Dan Guido, co-founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits, which has audited over 20 different cryptocurrency projects, FumbleChain is similar to the wargames used in traditional software development.  “Competitions and training exercises are used throughout the security industry, sometimes in live competitions of 30,000 or more players at one time, to help educate and demonstrate the knowledge that participants have gained,” said Guido, adding:  “It's long overdue for blockchain security to have its own wargame.”  Users collect game points dubbed “fumblecoins” every time they exploit a vulnerability in the FumbleChain blockchain and capture one flag. (The coins are only of value within the game itself.) Kudelski’s Amiet says FumbleChain’s core technology “looks a lot like bitcoin,” only simpler.  Daryl Hok, COO of blockchain cybersecurity company CertiK, said FumbleChain is designed to make blockchain “approachable” for engineers coming from a diverse set of backgrounds.  “[FumbleChain] provides a gamified, wargames model that may interest a broad audience with its approachability and incentives,” said Hok. “The project currently focuses on source code level attacks, as opposed to economically oriented attacks, but that may be something that is added in the future.”  Indeed, Kudelski Head of Cybersecurity Research Nathan Hamiel hopes FumbleChain will take on a life of its own now that the code has been open-sourced on GitHub.  “So many projects like this have a tendency to wither away as people move on to other things,” said Hamiel. “I feel the only way to have a successful project like this is to have it be open-source. … We’re hoping people continue to not only utilize but develop new challenges and really come on board and be a part of the project.”  Lessons from battle  FumbleChain was birthed after Kudelski completed a number of security audits for cryptocurrency projects including privacy coins Monero and Zcash, said Hamiel.  The first challenge on FumbleChain simulates what is called a replay attack, where duplicate transactions are generated on two separate chains. This attack vector was a concern back in 2017 during the chain split between bitcoin and bitcoin cash.  Other blockchain attack vectors identified on FumbleChain include transaction input validation, public key and wallet address mismatch, as well as denial of service or “spam” attacks.  Speaking to these network vulnerabilities, Hamiel said:  “The blockchain ecosystem has many of the same vulnerabilities that a traditional [software] ecosystem has. If you think about it at a low-level, a blockchain is not very useful without the ecosystem around it … exchanges, wallets, etc.”  As such, FumbleChain also offers a browser-based web wallet and blockchain explorer to mess around with.  Further expanding FumbleChain to include both smart-contract challenges and lessons on blockchain privacy are next steps both Hamiel and Amiet hope to see in the months to come.  At the very least, says Marc Laliberte, a senior security analyst at WatchGuard Technologies, FumbleChain could have an impact on existing blockchain applications by creating opportunities for “hands-on” learning.  Laliberte said:  “Experience with identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities is a great way to learn how to not make the same mistakes yourself. FumbleChain provides an opportunity for developers and enthusiasts to learn about common flaws and play around in a safe ecosystem, and then take that knowledge back to their own applications.”  FumbleChain image via Kudelski Security",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH | FORKS,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/14/meet-fumblechain-the-deliberately-flawed-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b78a4a8329097f11ca297036fa454cb06b05d109-2412x1600.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC said on Monday that New England-based SimplyVital Health, Inc. raised around $6.3 million in ether (ETH) via a pre-sale of its HLTH tokens to fund a touted ""healthcare-related blockchain ecosystem"" called Health Nexus.  The pre-sale was notably offered under a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFTs) arrangement – a model supposedly designed to simplify the ICO process and reduce the risk of enforcement actions by offering investment contracts rather than tokens. Following the pre-sale, which closed in April 2018, the firm did not move forward with the planned public offering.  The firm sold HLTH tokens that were ""not be delivered to investors unless and until created by SimplyVital,"" according to the SEC.  The commission ultimately ruled that the company had violated provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 by not registering the SAFT with the regulator prior to the offering and did not qualify for an exemption from registration.  SimplyVital complied with a cease-and-desist order from the SEC, while not ""admitting or denying the SEC's findings.""  By April 19, 2019, SimplyVital had voluntarily returned the bulk of the funds raised from investors – a factor that the SEC said it took into account when it decided not to impose civil penalties.  As reported in March 2018, industry sources had told CojnDesk that the SEC was likely going after SAFT sales.  One candid source said at the time:  “The SEC is targeting SAFTs. The new approach of the SEC is to consider tokens as both utility and security at the same time, meaning a token can bring utility to a platform but at the same time can be considered as a security if you sold it to parties that mainly looked for profit on its increase in value.”  SEC image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/14/blockchain-firm-settles-with-sec-over-unregistered-63-million-saft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42dd537765c73d67dae5bc8e07bdc5bb7eff2259-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382541,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ryhF,1565787641,"Messages Proving Wright Created Bitcoin Likely ‘Faked,’ Developer Testifies","Jonathan Warren, the developer of Bitmessage, testified in a pre-trial examination as part of the continuing Kleiman v. Wright lawsuit.  During his deposition at Hudson Yards in New York City on July 24, Warren testified to his role in developing Bitmessage and opined on the possibility that the self-alleged creator of bitcoin, Craig Wright, and his business partner, David Kleiman, had access to the messaging software prior to its release.  This testimony, as part of a document surfaced August 13, speaks to one of the central claims of the prosecution: that Wright forged a series of contracts, emails, and BitMessages that purported to place Kleiman’s assets under Wright’s control.  At stake is a 1.1 million cache of bitcoin, collectively acquired by Wright and Kleiman and kept in the encrypted Tulip Trust. Ira Kleiman, Dave’s brother, is suing Australian-born Wright for allegedly defrauding the Kleiman estate out of some $5 billion worth of bitcoin.  Backdating Messages  According to the document, Warren alleges that messages pertaining to the formation of the Tulip Trust sent between Wright and Kleiman are likely forged. He was asked about Bitmessages dated November 6 and 13, 2012 with subject lines such as “The trust process,” “Regarding the trust process,” and “1933.” 1933https://www.morrisoncohen.com/siteFiles/files/2018_02_14%20-%20Kleiman%20v_%20Wright.pdf likely refers to a wallet address held by Craig in escrow, according to the initial complaint.  Warren confirmed that the communications protocol was not released until November 19, and these messages were likely “faked.”  Warren was also asked whether it is possible to alter the date and time a Bitmessage displays as received or sent. He affirmed that it’s possible to “trick the software” into displaying the wrong date and time a computer's local time is backdated before sending a message.  During the cross-examination it came to light that Warren had put forward misleading testimony that he had not asked for help when developing the code.  The defense also established that Warren had been in communication with Wright about a potential audit of Bitmessage in November 2014, contradicting testimony that Warren had not known of Wright prior to his claim to be the pseudonymous inventor of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2016.

42382547,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ryon,1565784435,R3's Marco Polo Trade Blockchain Takes Another Step Toward Production,"Marco Polo, the trade finance blockchain network launched in 2017 by R3 and TradeIX, is moving slowly but surely toward production.  The latest milestone in the 22-bank blockchain consortium’s methodical piloting process allows a third party to a trade (in this case a logistics provider) to trigger a payment to a supplier in real-time at the moment the goods are on their way to their destination.  This work builds on the first Marco Polo test transactions carried out in March of this year between two member banks – LBBW and Commerzbank – which executed a trade between engineering technology firm Voith and KSB SE, a pump and valve manufacturer. This time, besides the two companies involved, logistics provider Logwin AG added data to the blockchain and initiated the payment obligation.  Gerald Böhm, head of guarantees and trade finance at Voith, said in a statement on Wednesday:  “For the first time, we have processed the purchase and delivery of special hydraulic couplings from Germany to Taiwan using blockchain technology. We executed this transaction with KSB, the leading pump and valve manufacturer, via the Marco Polo network.”  Ralf van Velzen, head of export financing at KSB SE & Co, added: “As a buyer, together with our bank we can ensure that the payment commitment becomes effective only if the goods are actually in the hands of the logistics provider, and on their way to the delivery destination”  Global trade and its transactional banking arrangements are hampered by data being locked in silos and in some cases paper-based processes. Getting participants on the same page and working together in real-time removes risk from trade networks. Or, as elegantly stated in a recent report by TradeIX, up until now, trading parties have simply been sending and receiving messages that are reflections of the past, not the present.  Busy space  Because of the obvious efficiency gains, blockchain-based trade finance is now a busy space. There are some 30 consortia working in this area, including Voltron which also runs on R3’s Corda network; ethereum-based CargoX; and Asia-focused eTrade Connect, which works on Hyperledger Fabric.  In terms of how this race is being run, first out the blocks into live production was we.trade, the IBM Blockchain partnered European SME-focused trade consortium, which also runs on Hyperledger Fabric. There are clear interoperability plays on the side of the Corda and Fabric networks, and there are also some banks involved in multiple projects running on different flavors of DLT.  Things look promising in the long run for firms running on R3’s open-source Corda, which is growing into a vibrant network. So while we.trade forges onward (and it may be some time in 2020 before Marco Polo sees the full light of day) there are some tantalizing possibilities ahead for Corda users, such as enabling instant of settlement of trades via ""cash on the ledger.""  In a recent interview  showcasing Corda-based Digital Asset Shared Ledger (DASL), Richard Crook, CEO of Lab577 predicted that goods and services would soon be able to flow one way across the ledger and the payment for those goods and services to flow the other way on the same ledger.  “In the case of trade finance, you want to have stores of value on-chain which the Marco Polos and the TradeIXs of the world can use,” he said.

42382564,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rz59,1565780477,Bitcoin's Price Looks Set for a Drop to $10K,"View  Bitcoin appears on track to test the psychological support of $10,000, as the daily chart moving averages and other key indicators have turned bearish.  A high-volume price breakdown seen on the hourly chart also favors a drop to $10,000.  However, the hourly chart indicators are reporting a bullish divergence. So, a price bounce to $10,700 could precede a drop to $10,000.  The outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish if prices print a UTC close above $12,000.  Bitcoin (BTC) is looking south, having retraced more than 50 percent of the $3,000 rally seen in the 10 days to Aug. 6.  The top cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at $10,500 on Bitstamp, representing a 6 percent loss on the day.  At the current price, roughly 53 percent of the rally from the July 28 low of $9,111 to the Aug. 6 high of $12,325 stands erased.  BTC’s recent rally coincided with the devaluation of China’s yuan (CNY). Notably, the People’s Bank of China allowed the yuan to fall beyond 7 per U.S. dollar on Aug. 5.  On the same day, BTC rallied 7 percent and rose to a one-month high of $12,325 on the following day, triggering speculation that BTC is acting as a safe haven asset in China.  That narrative may become entrenched in the market as bitcoin’s drop seen in the last 48 hours is accompanied by a recovery in the yuan. CNY appreciated by 0.26 percent yesterday and is reporting a 0.32 percent gain against the greenback on Wednesday.  However, Peter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital Group and a bitcoin skeptic, believes the cryptocurrency did not act as a safe haven in China. Investors who bought bitcoins based on the safe-haven narrative are now cashing out, tracking the recovery in yuan, he says.  Meanwhile, Jacob Canfield, featured trader on CNBC and CoinDesk, has associated bitcoin’s price drop with the delay in fiat withdrawals and deposits for cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase’s U.K. customers. The delay is likely caused by Barclays bank’s decision to end its partnership with Coinbase.  Whatever the reason for the price drop, the cryptocurrency is now looking weaker than it did yesterday, although a drop to $10,000 could be preceded by a minor bounce.  Daily chart  A bearish crossover of the 5- and 10-day moving averages and a below-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI) indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside.  The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram has also crossed below zero, confirming a bullish-to-bearish trend change.  So, the cryptocurrency looks set to test $10,000. The outlook would turn bullish if and when prices print a UTC close above $12,000. That level acted as strong resistance in six days to Aug. 10.  Hourly and 4-hour charts  The high-volume descending triangle breakdown seen in the hourly chart (above left) indicates that sellers are in control.  However, both RSI and MACD have charted higher lows on the hourly chart, contradicting the lower lows on price.  That bullish divergence of key indicators suggests scope for a price bounce, possibly to the resistance at $10,700 A violation there would expose $11,000.  The oversold reading on the 4-hour RSI (above right) also indicates scope for an intraday recovery rally.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The South Korean tech giant has now included bitcoin features to the developer kit (SDK) for several S10 models (S10e, S10, S10+ and S10 5G), as well as the Note10 and Note10+ devices.

42382555,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ryyr,1565770386,UK Advertising Watchdog Upholds Complaints Against BitMEX Bitcoin Promotion,"The U.K. Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has upheld complaints over a bitcoin ad placed by crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX (HDR Global Trading).  The advertising regulator published its decision on Wednesday, saying that it supported the four complaints against the ad that had claimed it ""failed to illustrate the risk of the investment,"" ""exaggerated the return on the investment"" and ""challenged whether it was misleading.""  The ad, placed on Jan. 3, 2019, purportedly to celebrate the tenth anniversary of mining of the first block of bitcoin on the same date in 2009, showed a graph spread across two pages, according to the ASA.  The ASA further described the promotion, saying:  It included a footer on the front page of a national newspaper that read ""Thanks Satoshi, we owe you one. Happy 10th Birthday, Bitcoin"", the graph and text next to it and a full page article written by the CEO and co-founder of HDR Global Trading Arthur Hayes titled ""Two sides of the coin: the bifurcated near-future of money.""  In its ruling, the watchdog pointed out that the graph ""used a logarithmic scale on its y-axis which meant that the equally spaced values on that scale did not increase by the same amount each time and instead increased by orders of magnitude.""  While it acknowledged that log graphs can be ""a valid and useful way of presenting data,"" the agency said that interpreting the graph would need some specialist knowledge of the topic and that, without an accompanying explanation, the graph ""was unlikely to be familiar or readily understandable to the national newspaper audience to whom the ad was directed.""  The ASA concluded that people viewing the ad were ""likely to be misled about bitcoin’s value and stability in recent years and therefore about what any investments they might previously have made would have yielded.""  The text included with the ad also came in for criticism, with the ASA saying that it didn't ""mitigated the overwhelming impression about Bitcoin's value created by the graph.""  BitMEX had included phrases describing bitcoin as ""still very much an experiment"", adding that ""the road ahead will be challenging."" It also mentioned ""price volatility.""  Yet, the full text stated, ""Despite price volatility and how entirely bonkers the system seems, the Bitcoin protocol appears robust. And although the road ahead will be challenging, there's a reason to believe Bitcoin's still got a chance at glory.""  ""We considered that was a clear promotional statement of Bitcoin's merits and did very little to warn consumers of any risks,"" said the ASA. As such it concluded that the ad had ""misleadingly exaggerated the return on investment, failed to illustrate the risk of the investment and therefore concluded it was in breach of the Code.""  The ASA barred the exchange from using the ad in its current form in the U.K. It also advised the firm to ensure its promotions are set out so as to be ""readily understood by the audience being addressed"" and that investment risks are clearly indicated.  BitMEX's CEO has been notably in the public eye over his public debate with economist Nouriel Roubini.  In early July, the two sparred over the nature of cryptocurrency at a public event, with famously anti-crypto Roubini afterwards claiming BitMEX had suppressed video of a debate in which he claimed to have ""destroyed"" Hayes. Some parts of the video were released soon after.  Roubini had previously attacked BitMEX, saying it “may be openly involved in systematic illegality,” according to Bloomberg. He argued that, in providing high leverage to traders, the platform is exposing them to too much risk.  Seychelles-based BitMEX is also reportedly being probed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over whether the exchange has allowed U.S. traders to use its platform.

42382553,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rz07,1565755892,"Two Libertarians, Two Views on Bitcoin's Ability to Disrupt Fiat Money","“Half of the audience here is like, ‘I hope you die in a fire.’”  As a libertarian, comedian and podcast host Dave Smith has a lot of common ground with bitcoin enthusiasts, who have a reputation for having a libertarian bent. But when he and others argue that bitcoin isn’t going to replace government-issued currencies, Smith argues (jokingly, of course) that this is the response he gets.  Smith’s opening Soho Forum, a monthly debate in south Manhattan, attracting a group of mostly libertarians, or people that believe less government input in people’s lives would improve the world’s standard of living.  Monday’s topic is whether bitcoin is “suited” to help with that, by taking on central banks, the powerful entities across the world that control national money supplies, for better or worse. Judging by the fact that it’s a libertarian debate, most in the crowd were agreement on the point that the role of central banks should be audited or diminished, if not eliminated altogether.  Bitcoin takes control over the creation of money from any one entity, including governments. It sounds like a libertarian fantasy. Yet, many libertarians seem pretty skeptical it will actually pan out as a currency that will replace government currencies.  The precise wording of the resolution up to debate was: “Bitcoin is poorly suited to the purpose of becoming any nation’s main medium of exchange,” or an object that can be transferred for goods. Think the dollar.  With economist George Selgin arguing in favor of this resolution, while ""The Bitcoin Standard"" author and economist Saifedean Ammous argued against.  Selgin likes the goals of bitcoin. introducing more currency competition where governments currently have sole power. In fact, he’s the director of a research wing of the Cato Institute exploring alternatives to central banks.  But bitcoin, he argued, “isn’t up to the task.”  Ordinary people  “The first question about money is, 'What can you buy with it?'” Selgin argued, cutting to the chase.  He pointed out that it’s hard for people to find a store that even accepts the cryptocurrency.  “When ordinary people – which excludes many of you – think, ‘What kind of money do I want to equip myself with? What should I use as a medium of exchange?’ The answer, first of all is, what’s everyone else using? What does the store down the street take?” the economist said, implying that bitcoin does not satisfy these needs.  But he was just getting started.  The economist continued:  “How risky is this to have on hand all the time? Is it going to decrease rapidly in value while I’m at the grocery store? Do I have to come up with all sorts of elaborate plans to protect myself?”  He went on to argue that bitcoin is not generally the answer people come away with when thinking about these questions. Additionally, Selgin pointed to bitcoin’s volatility in price, sometimes high transaction fees, and slow settlement as other reasons your average Joe isn’t flocking to bitcoin – and probably won’t.  Unrealistic assessment  Ammous, on the other hand, argued that while bitcoin isn’t perfect, it continues to grow quite rapidly.  “I think the notion that bitcoin has been failing is completely unrealistic. […] Bitcoin has been growing non-stop the last 10 years,” Ammous said.  While Selgin argues it is hard to find a store that accepts bitcoin, Ammous argues that’s because use is spread across the whole globe, rather than being restricted to just one nation. By global economic statistics, he asserted that bitcoin is one of the 20 largest-valued currencies in the world.  “Most importantly, it is the only working alternative to central banks,” he said, not swayed by the idea that a better alternative will come along and replace it  Give it time to mature, he said.  “The idea that bitcoin has to be born ready to handle everybody’s transactions overnight and to have all the world’s liquidity to do it overnight from its creation – or else it has failed – I think that’s a completely unrealistic way of assessing it. Bitcoin is growing in every metric that matters,” Ammous said.  He pointed out that other moneys have been replaced with newer ones over time.  Seashells have been used as money by groups of people in the past, for example. What he is implying here is clear: bitcoin might be the next in line.

42382548,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ryl1,1565744915,Barclays Is No Longer Banking Coinbase,"The most prestigious banking relationship in crypto has ended.  Barclays, the London-based global bank, is no longer working with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, industry sources told CoinDesk. And while Coinbase found a replacement in U.K. upstart ClearBank, according to people familiar with the situation, the change has indirectly inconvenienced the exchange's users.  That's because, aside from the cachet of working with a household-name bank, Barclays connected San Francisco-based Coinbase to the U.K. Faster Payments Scheme (FPS), enabling users to instantly withdraw and deposit British pounds at the exchange. The end of the relationship disrupted Coinbase’s access to FPS – which in turn slowed deposits and withdrawals in GBP for U.K. customers, which now take days to process.  The situation is temporary, though, thanks to Coinbase's new relationship with ClearBank. One of the U.K. ""challenger banks"" that have sprouted up in recent years to compete with market incumbents, ClearBank is expected to restore Coinbase's FPS access by the end of the third quarter.  Barclays, ClearBank and Coinbase all declined to comment.  Cold feet  Companies that handle cryptocurrency have a tough time getting banking partners, with almost all big-name banks eschewing that business.  Hence, when Coinbase obtained a bank account with Barclays in early 2018, the news was greeted with some fanfare. The exchange was also granted an e-money license by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and was the first crypto firm to gain access to FPS.  Since then, word on the street is that Barclays got cold feet about crypto clients; people have varying opinions on why this might be the case, but nobody knows for sure.  “It is my understanding that Barclays’ risk appetite has contracted a little – I’m not sure exactly why or what’s been driving that, maybe there has been some activity they are not happy with. But it’s about Barclays’ comfort level with crypto as a whole,” said the CEO of a U.K. crypto company who chose to remain nameless.  Another source described the Coinbase-Barclays relationship as a pilot program that has simply run its course.  This source added that being banked by Barclays had probably held Coinbase back in terms of which coins and tokens the exchange wanted to list, and the time taken before the bank could feel comfortable with new assets being added.  'Zero' tolerance  That's not to say ClearBank is giving Coinbase carte blanche.  Earlier this week, Coinbase de-listed zcash, the privacy-centric cryptocurrency, which uses a technology called zero-knowledge proofs to mask details of transactions from blockchain watchers. A person familiar with the decision said it was “completely to do with the new bank”; ClearBank was uncomfortable indirectly supporting a currency with features that make law enforcement's job harder.  Coinbase was not the only crypto company to successfully woo Barclays. In 2016, when the bank was perhaps more enthusiastic about the technology, Barclays said it was working with Circle Internet Financial, whose main offering at the time was Circle Pay, an FCA-regulated app that used bitcoin to help facilitate no-fee currency transfers. Customer deposits were held by Barclays.  Barclays said at that time: “We can confirm that Barclays Corporate Banking has been chosen as a financial partner by Circle, and we support the exploration of positive uses of blockchain that can benefit consumers and society.”  Both Barclays and Circle (which has since shifted its focus from retail payments to crypto trading) declined to comment on the status of their relationship.  In addition to working with Barclays, Coinbase has had a banking relationship with Estonia-based LHV Bank for a number of years. LHV has been working to offer access to Faster Payments in the U.K. but, according to industry sources, this might still be a ways off.  A spokeswoman for LHV told CoinDesk: “We have technically joined the Faster Payments scheme, but there are still some issues we have to work on and legal details to manage before we can start offering Faster Payments to our fintech clients.”  Other on-ramps  Elsewhere in the U.K., FCA-regulated crypto broker BCB Group is also working with ClearBank. The broker recently announced a deal to bring Luxembourg-based exchange BitStamp onto Faster Payments for GBP.  Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, BCB’s founder and CEO, told CoinDesk: “All our clients’ GBP funds clear within 60 seconds both ways via FPS; Bitstamp is likely to be set up internally to pass that benefit on to their GBP customers (by processing payment information as fast as they receive it).”  Another popular route into Faster Payments is via FCA-regulated Enumis, which recently began working with Coinfloor, the U.K.’s longest running exchange, to broker banking relationships for crypto companies.  Also acting as an Enumis intermediary is U.K.-based Cashaa, which is helping to get banking and FPS access to projects on Binance Chain, the blockchain created by the world's largest crypto exchange.  Despite its de-risking of crypto, Barclays still offers operational banking services to Blockchain, the U.K. wallet provider which recently announced plans to move into the exchange space with its super-fast PIT trading service.  Blockchain did not say by press time if its Barclays account was the means by which the firm would bring Faster Payments to its new exchange business.
