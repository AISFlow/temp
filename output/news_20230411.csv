11662010,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526508,1681255066,Ethereum On-Chain Data Point To Clear Skies Ahead Of The Shanghai Upgrade,"As the long-awaited Shanghai upgrade finally nears tomorrow, April 12th, the Ethereum (ETH) network and the crypto market are about to experience a significant influx of funds, as $33.5 billion worth of ETH is set to become available for use or sale. The upcoming Shanghai upgrade will enable validators to withdraw their staked ETH and use it as they please, resulting in a surge in liquidity for the cryptocurrency market. Before this upgrade, staking ETH was a one-way street, as Jarvis Labs’ analyst JJ the Janitor described in a recent article, with validators unable to withdraw their funds once they were staked. As the Shanghai upgrade approaches and validators can un-stake their ETH, the cryptocurrency market is bracing for a potential surge in activity. The question on many investors’ minds is whether the unlocked ETH will lead to a massive wave of selling pressure or whether holders will choose to keep their tokens, particularly with the bull market on the horizon. Related Reading: XRP Set To Skyrocket 47% If Key Resistance Breaks, Analyst Suggests Positive Signs Ahead Of The Upgrade For Ethereum In its recent analysis ahead of the Shanghai upgrade, JJ the Janitor highlights that last month ETH delivered the resistance break above the $1,700 level, which is key for the cryptocurrency, with a retest of support in March that quickly led to a breakout above resistance, as we have seen in recent days. Furthermore, JJ highlights some important nuances surrounding the Shanghai unlocks and how they may affect Ethereum’s price. One key point is that withdrawal limits are in place that cap the amount of ETH that can be unstaked daily, which could help mitigate any immediate sell pressure on the price of the cryptocurrency. Additionally, JJ notes that a significant amount of selling may already be priced into the market. Many stakers who need access to cash have already sold claims to their staked ETH “over-the-counter” or hedged their long position with shorts via options and futures contracts. Given these factors, JJ suggests that any narrative-driven dips back into the $1,700 range should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a sudden end of the 2023 bull run. ETH Whales Lead The Price Movements JJ the Janitor shows, on the chart below, the behavior of ETH whales during the March dip. JJ notes that during this dip, whales found deep value in the $1,450-$1,550 range, as indicated by the prevalence of red and orange dots below. This suggests that despite the market turbulence, large holders of ETH saw an opportunity to buy the cryptocurrency at a discounted price. Furthermore, there was a sighting of ETH whales accumulating the cryptocurrency in the $1,000-$1,200 range for the first time since the post–FTX debacle period. Additionally, JJ notes that March also saw an all-time high on the ETH exchange-whale ratio chart, which for JJ, suggests that there are multiple positive indicators for the future of ETH. In addition, JJ uses the 30-day returns metric, which was stuck under resistance for two years, from mid-2018 until 2020, indicating a lack of bullish momentum in the market. However, once the trend broke through and regained momentum, it coincided with the price of Ethereum shattering through a key resistance level. JJ notes that price and 30-day returns have broken above key resistance levels in unison, indicating a potential bullish trend shortly. If this breakout is real, JJ suggests that we should expect 30-day returns and ETH’s price to begin a cycle of rapid appreciation in the coming months.

42411179,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQxT,1681254152,World Regulators Are Looking at DeFi,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is entering regulators’ crosshairs, but they don’t seem to be intent on taking it out – yet anyway. Instead a pair of reports from U.S. and French authorities seem more focused on understanding what sort of risks DeFi might pose to both users and the broader financial world, and whether there are ways to mitigate these risks while still allowing their operation.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  DeFi by any other name  The narrative  Decentralized finance (DeFi) is suddenly a major topic of concern among financial regulators, with both the U.S. and France publishing reports analyzing the potential risks these projects might pose to their respective governments and providing recommendations for how regulators and developers can mitigate these concerns.  Why it matters  DeFi has been a growing part of the crypto sector for a while now, but recent exchange collapses, bank failures and lender bankruptcies are shining a wider spotlight on decentralized (or purportedly decentralized) projects. Regulators are now looking at how they may oversee these entities and services.  Breaking it down  The U.S. Treasury Department and French central bank both published reports assessing how well DeFi entities meet anti-money laundering regulations and how these entities and tools may be used in illicit finance.  The U.S. risk assessment pointed to some of the major hacks and issues in DeFi over the past few months, such as North Korea’s use of DeFi to launder funds and other related concerns about how DeFi projects may not meet know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) rules or just be really easy to steal from.  To be clear, these reports weren’t exactly positive for crypto. The U.S. report, for example, noted that many DeFi projects are open source in the hopes that the broader community may spot vulnerabilities, but this same open sourcing may allow attackers to find an exploit.  “This vulnerability can be compounded if the smart contracts are not written carefully or if they lack a mechanism for quick deactivation or alterations if a critical exploit is identified,” the U.S. report said. “As such, it is critical that the DeFi service identify and address vulnerabilities and potential exploits in open-source code.”  But the report seems fairly neutral toward DeFi itself – the recommendations ranged from “strengthening existing supervisory and enforcement actions” to meet legal requirements to better engaging with private-sector projects.  The French report similarly suggested that the government could create a set of “minimum standards” that would define how it assessed risks and decentralization, or otherwise try and move financial transactions to specifically private blockchains. The report even suggested going so far as to create a certification for developers to meet.  The U.S. Treasury Department also posed a number of questions for public feedback, including how it should determine if any given DeFi project is actually a financial institution subject to Bank Secrecy Act regulations.  The U.S. report even hinted at the suggestion of providing further guidance for projects which could provide clarity.  “The assessment finds that non-compliance by covered DeFi services with AML/CFT obligations may be partially attributable to a lack of understanding of how AML/CFT regulations apply to DeFi services,” the report said, referring to combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). “Are there additional recommendations for ways to clarify and remind DeFi services that fall under the BSA definition of a financial institution of their existing AML/CFT regulatory obligations?”  The reports, while often quite critical of DeFi, both seem to operate from the base understanding that these projects will continue operating, and aren’t calling for banning this segment of the crypto sector.

The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently hovering over $30,200, up over 3% in the past 24 hours. BTC topped the psychologically important $30,000 level late Monday evening (ET) for the first time since last June. Analysts expect the March CPI to continue a recent cooling trend with the year-over-year rate rising 5.2%, down from February’s 6%. The month-over-month rate is also expected to cool.  “Traders [are] speculating that this week’s CPI number could come in at a level that gives the Fed reason to think about pausing raising rates in the next meeting, thereby giving a boost to assets like bitcoin,” James Lavish, managing partner at Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, told CoinDesk in an email.  Lavish added that if BTC continues to rise “with conviction,” a move right into the mid to high $30,000 would be likely, forcing short speculators to cover and buy instead. Some investors are trying to get positioned ahead of that.”  Analysts at K33 Research highlighted in a note to clients on Tuesday that open interest (OI) in BTC perpetuals surged by 10% to 297,000 BTC on Monday to reach its highest daily growth in open interest since early October. That spurt was followed by volatility and an intraday decline.  “While BTC’s performance following surges in OI has varied, it has tended to foreshadow long or short squeezes,” analysts wrote, adding that similar daily growth in OI occurred during a spring rally in 2022 and before the short squeeze of July 2021.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was recently trading at around $1,895, up 0.3% from Monday, same time. Validators and market watchers will be watching Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade, which is expected to go live Wednesday evening (ET) and will mean that validators can withdraw their long-locked-up ETH from the Beacon Chain.  Crypto data firm Kaiko highlighted in a Tuesday report that ETH markets have been heavily spot-driven over the past month, with the perpetual futures-to-spot ratio hitting its lowest level since the network's Merge in September. In contrast, that ratio had surged to nearly double pre-Merge levels at the start of the year.  Among other digital tokens, Solana’s SOL surged over 12% to trade around $23.2, while ETC, the token of Ethereum Classic, an offshoot, or fork, of Ethereum, gained over 4% to change hands at $21.6. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was up 2.3% for the day.  The crypto market’s rally also coincided with crypto-related stocks’ continued momentum from Monday. Shares of bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) closed up 12% on Tuesday, while both exchange Coinbase (COIN) and business software company MicroStrategy (MSTR), a large corporate holder of BTC, were up more than 6%.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) want to know why crypto companies, including bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi and stablecoin issuer Circle, banked at now-collapsed Silicon Valley Bank.  The lawmakers sent letters to BlockFi and Circle on Sunday with a list of questions and concerns. Twelve other non-crypto firms received similar letters.  The two Democratic lawmakers are looking for more information on what they call the “mutual backscratching dynamic” between SVB and venture capitalists, in which the bank treated VCs and other high-rolling depositors to extensive lines of credit and luxurious “white glove” services like “industry ski trips, conferences and fancy dinners.”  The proverbial champagne service, the lawmakers argue, “could help explain why some customers placed massive, uninsured deposits at SVB” – which ultimately forced federal regulators to spend $20 billion to staunch the flow of withdrawals when the bank collapsed after a $42 billion single-day run last month.  Now, they want answers from Circle and BlockFi’s CEOs, Jeremy Allaire and Zac Prince, respectively.

Despite this, XRP bulls remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s prospects. Analysts like Ali Martinez believe XRP could potentially stage a significant breakout shortly. Related Reading: Stellar Breaks Long-Term Resistance, Recovery Underway? Will XRP Reach New Yearly Highs This Month? According to Ali, if XRP can secure a 3-day candlestick close above $0.54, it could trigger a 47% surge in price. This could potentially further push XRP’s price to the $0.80 level, which is a price point not seen for over a year from now. However, the token has struggled to consolidate above its nearest resistance level, which has prevented it from moving higher. XRP has been trading within a tight consolidation pattern in the last few days, with a price range between $0.390 and $0.530. This range is just below XRP’s major resistance zone, which needs to be broken for the token to move into higher-price territories. If XRP cannot break out of its consolidation pattern and move higher, the $0.450 level could be a critical support level for bullish investors. However, if XRP cannot maintain this level, the $0.417 and $0.375 levels will become important support floors to monitor in the event of a deeper retracement. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.518, representing a modest gain of 0.73% over the past 24 hours. Despite this moderate uptick, XRP’s bulls are looking for a major event to boost investor confidence and drive the token’s price even higher. Will A Potential Ripple Win Against The SEC Propel A New Rally? The Attorney and crypto supporter Jeremy Hogan has recently posted on Twitter why Ripple will win against the SEC. In his statement, Hogan highlights the unique value proposition of cryptocurrencies, particularly their decentralized nature. Unlike traditional financial systems, which a central authority or institution typically controls, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks that are not owned by any single entity. For Hogan, this makes cryptocurrencies like XRP an attractive investment option, as they can purchase the token without needing a contract with any specific company or institution. The attorney further suggests that the outcome of the current legal case involving Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may hinge on the judge’s understanding of cryptocurrency technology. Hogan believes that if the judge of her law clerk has a solid grasp of the technology behind cryptocurrencies like XRP, Ripple will likely win the case. However, for the attorney, if the judge does not fully understand cryptocurrency technology, then there might be room for the SEC to regain the upper hand. If Ripple is successful in its legal battle against the SEC, it could restore confidence among XRP holders and trigger a bullish uptrend cycle for the cryptocurrency. This could mark a turning point in the industry, leading to significant gains for the token.

42412346,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4dNc,1681247831,"Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade: Here’s Our Guide to Watch Parties, Blockchain Tools","(EDITOR'S NOTE: We're live-blogging here.)  Wednesday's highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain (referred to as “Shapella” by the diehards) is shaping up to be one of those where-were-you-when moments that happen every so often in crypto. Think along the lines of last September’s “Merge” – when Ethereum flipped from a proof-of-work network to proof-of-stake – or the roughly quadrennial bitcoin halvings.  If none of this means anything to you, it’s sort of the blockchain industry’s equivalent of queuing up in the middle of a pasture with a couple of pieces of cardboard to watch a solar eclipse.  As these things go, various factions of the Ethereum and blockchain communities are planning watch parties, while crypto analysts and blockchain historians are getting bearings on the best tools for monitoring the first-ever withdrawals of staked ether (ETH). (Trust us, it’s a big deal for Ethereum, and for the crypto industry in general.)  The Shanghai upgrade is expected on Wednesday at 22:27 UTC (6:27 p.m. ET) and we’ve compiled a list of helpful resources.  Watch parties  The Ethereum Cat Herders, a decentralized project management that helps with educational resources on the Ethereum blockchain, will be throwing a Shapella Mainnet Watch Party that will be livestreamed on YouTube, so you can watch them react to the upgrade in real time. The livestream starts at 5:45 p.m. ET, and you can watch it here.  EthStakers has a Shapella livestream, starting at 6 p.m. ET.  Nethermind will be hosting its own livestream at 4:30 p.m. ET on how the Shanghai upgrade might impact the crypto-economic landscape.  Blockchain explorers and other tools  Beacon Chain: The open-source Ethereum explorer beaconcha.in is another great resource to see when Shanghai goes live. Look out for epoch 194,048, which is when Shanghai will be triggered and staked ETH withdrawals will be enabled. If you click on that epoch once it is live, you should be able to see how much ETH withdrawals are available in that epoch. Additionally, if you’re looking to see how many withdrawals are being processed on the blockchain, including how much ETH is part of that, you can look at that here.  Wenmerge.com: A popular website for the Merge has been repurposed for Shanghai, where there are countdowns and dashboards that will estimate the withdrawal queue for validators looking to exit the Beacon Chain. You can look at these estimates here.  Etherscan’s Beacon Chain Smart Contract: For those curious to see how much ETH has been deposited for staking, and whether that will decrease or increase in the hours following Shanghai, you can check the smart contract on Etherscan to see whether that number changes here.

42389624,6F4ZR09tPAWQmeXaoSbQAq,1681247417,ROOK Investors Aim to ‘Rage Quit’ Through Plan to Liquidate $25M Crypto Treasury,"Rook’s well-funded offshoot Incubator DAO is holding a vote on its financial future where the organization could liquidate its entire $25 million treasury for payouts directly to ROOK token holders.  The vote, which runs through Thursday, considers a proposal to “rage quit” Incubator DAO by divvying up its $25 million treasury among holders of the ROOK governance token. The vote is being orchestrated by activist investors who for weeks have debated the future of Rook (an Ethereum-based MEV project) on Discord.  Historically, ROOK owners had a say over Rook DAO, the governing body that nominally controlled the Rook project (once known as KeeperDAO) since mid-2021. But an entity called Rook Labs has largely taken over management of Rook’s day-to-day operations, creating friction with token holders who felt shunned.  As a solution, Rook Labs orchestrated a vote to divorce ROOK the token from Rook the project. The new organization, IncubatorDAO, got 60% of Rook’s treasury to do with as it pleased. In return, ROOK holders lost all their theoretical rights to Rook’s intellectual property and future profits.  Four vocal critics of Rook Labs were elected to Incubator DAO’s oversight body on a platform of dissolving it by converting its treasury of cryptocurrencies to stablecoins that ROOK owners can claim.  The prospect of ROOK owners receiving a share of the money has contributed to a tripling of ROOK’s value over recent weeks. It was trading at $42 at press time, slightly over the price that some community estimates have placed on each token’s value relative to its share of the treasury.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/11/rook-investors-aim-to-rage-quit-through-plan-to-liquidate-25m-crypto-treasury,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7cda709a10053a462dfa20b16023deef63a8f3f6-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421084,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRn3,1681246303,Diana Biggs: Building Early-Stage Ventures in Web3,"Diana Biggs got into hacking at the age of 11. She was a natural. At age 15, on a lark, she hacked into the website of Tom Green. The comedian was amused and made her a regular guest on his weekly radio show – she appeared as “Hacker Girl.”  Years later, Biggs earned an MBA, worked for a management consulting firm, focused on finance, spent time in sub-Saharan African banking and eventually helped launch an e-commerce company that operated between Kenya and New York. But transferring funds to Africa was a headache – cumbersome and full of fees. Was there a better way? Her younger brother, a programmer, said to her, “Oh, check out bitcoin.”  Diana Biggs is a speaker at CoinDesk’s Consensus Festival in Austin, April 26-28.  That was in 2013.  Suddenly, Biggs discovered a field that combined her teenage obsessions (computers and hacking) with her adult vocation (banking and fintech), and she’s been a fixture in the crypto space ever since. Biggs served as HSBC’s private banking global head of innovation, she was the CEO of Valour and now she’s a partner at 1kx, an early-stage venture capital fund.  “It’s really tough to be an entrepreneur,” says Biggs at a recent interview at a Denver cafe. Biggs knows. She’s been on both sides of the table – in scrappy startups and in deep-pocketed investment firms. So she shares some hard-earned advice on what founders can do to get noticed by VCs, what it’s like to work at a fund (Spoiler alert: It’s not a cushy gig) and why her prediction for the space is “tremendous growth.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  You joined 1kx in October 2022, right in the depths of crypto winter. How has the bear market impacted your work?  In some ways it hasn’t. One of the reasons I was excited to join 1kx is because they are very crypto-native, working with builders across crypto and Web3. So I’m getting closer to the tech.  And when you get closer to the tech, you’re less fazed by the macro environment?  Yeah, I would say so. Especially for earlier-stage projects. When you’re a larger company and you have clients across lots of different sectors, then the overall economy will affect you more in broader strokes.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - Magdalena Kala: How I Invest in Web3  What most excites you in the space right now? What are the use cases that most of us are overlooking, that no one is talking about?  Well, I don't really know what people are talking about, but one new area we’re really interested in is on-chain gaming. It can unlock a lot of interesting opportunities both on the demand side and the supply side, with people creating games. That could inspire games that you haven’t even thought of.  I’m bullish on that as well. [Check out my deep-dive into bitcoin-fueled mobile games.] What else?  There are a lot of interesting new projects coming out around co-creation. A collaborative creator economy type of thing.  Example?  Song Camp, which is one of our portfolio companies. People come together not only to create music but to create your own record label.  OK,I’ll ask the old question, “What problem is that solving?”  The way the music industry tends to work now, if you’re a solo artist and collaborating with your producer and mixer, there are so many stories of musicians getting screwed over by their label or record company. So to be able to create that all together from scratch [via smart contracts] I think is super.  Let’s pivot to your job itself at 1kx. What’s the job like? What are your goals?  The real focus of my role is to help our portfolio companies, mostly with institutional connectivity. Helping them to reach broader audiences and bridging the gaps between traditional companies of all types. And understanding, what are the needs of these types of companies? Can they be building or partnering with our portfolio, and then helping the portfolio through different types of growth?  Interesting. Stepping back a bit, people might think that once they have a brilliant idea for a Web3 startup, then all it takes is some quick coding and they’re good to go.  But it’s much more complicated than that, right? And it requires the right connections and communication and marketing.  Yeah. Some people might just need conversations to understand an institutional market. Others might need other kinds of support. There’s one portfolio company I’m working with that’s a highly technical proposition, so I’m helping them develop their messaging and working it through in a hands-on way.  What are the most common things you help the portfolio companies with?  I’d say a lot around messaging, developing propositions, making introductions and helping to frame certain strategies.  To get the attention of a VC or an investor, you really need to be part of the community  What’s the average age of people you work with? Are they all 22-year-olds?  Not everyone, but most people are probably mid to late 20s.  Your age.  Exactly.  What are your hours like?  The team works extremely hard. And I’m kind of always on, just like the space. But they love it. This is a group of incredibly passionate individuals. They would have to be for the amount of work we do.  For real, though, what kind of hours do you work, if you don’t mind sharing?  Yeah. I’m not a healthy example. [Laughs.] And having been in the space for the last nine years, a lot of my social network is also crypto. Then it all kind of blends into one. [Editor’s note: This answer is strikingly similar to what fund-manager Magdalena Kala shared in a recent interview.]  And when you work with early-stage companies and as a VC, you need to be testing, trying, experimenting and reading up on all of the latest things. And it’s a highly technical space as well, so there’s always so much more to learn.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - Illia Polosukhin: Building Near's Blockchain, Embedding AI  To that point, how do you stay up to speed? What are your productivity hacks for media consumption? What tools do you use?  Yeah, I don’t have a hack. But definitely Twitter, and also Telegram groups of trusted people I’ve known for a long time. Discords are a necessary evil; not my favorite thing, but that can be really helpful to get plugged into specific communities. Conferences are also really helpful to actually meet people and see where there’s energy and movement and whatnot. As much as crypto can be a never-ending conference circle, it’s a really important aspect.  What are your specific goals when you attend conferences? Are you trying to discover new projects? Make new connections?  For me, it’s more about meeting people. In Denver, it was great to meet our existing portfolio, the people that I’m actually working with. To actually meet them in real life.  What advice would you give to founders or to people who are creating in the space right now, who might want to one day be one of your portfolio companies and work with you?  For people who want to get the attention of a VC or an investor, I think you really need to be part of the community. It will depend on what you’re doing, so this is not advice to everybody. But to be deeply involved in what you are building and to actually be participating. For crypto specifically, I’d say you should be participating in that community or network.  Say I was interested in doing a ZK [zero-knowledge proofs] startup. There are ZK-specific hackathons happening all the time. We're actually sponsoring one right now. Going to those hackathons, building and doing whatever you can to prove and test your idea and be prepared for the conversations. I think there's a surprising amount of people who are like, “Oh, I have this idea. Like, do you wanna chat?” You have to really have done your homework.  And there’s a lot to be said for demonstrating enthusiasm.  For sure.  Just from what I’ve seen in my experience, when you watch some entrepreneurs become very successful and build out different companies, when people are really, really passionate about what they’re doing and truly committed to that idea, that can come across.  What would you say separates the projects and founders that flourish from the ones that, for whatever reason, don’t quite make it? What characteristics or attributes would you cite?  I would say the willingness and ability to take feedback, for personal growth.  That’s very self-serving of you to say, because as an adviser you’re the one giving feedback, right?  [Both laugh.]  This is also from my experience having been on the leadership team of a number of different startups.  When you’re building a startup, from experience, it takes over your entire life. You have to really believe in your idea when everyone else is telling you, no, it’s crazy, and that it can never happen. That’s how the best ideas start. So on the one hand, you have to stick with your idea and really believe it.  And then on the other hand, you have to be able to understand when something isn’t working and then be able to pivot and grow. I think it’s very difficult to think of any company that didn’t have some kind of pivot, or a need to change course.  To your point, it’s been a while since Apple has focused on desktop Macintoshes.  Yeah. So that ability to evolve and take feedback. And also to make the tough calls and then stick with it. I mean, in crypto you can easily find out who’s fair-weather, right? Everything’s happening at 100 times the speed of normal life. So you see, who’s gonna stick it out? Not everybody can. It’s really tough to be an entrepreneur.  Any predictions for the space over the next few years?  I think that we’re going to continue to see tremendous growth. Obviously, it’s difficult in terms of waiting for regulatory clarity. And there’s so much more scrutiny now because of recent events. But what feels different [from previous cycles] is that institutions aren’t leaving like they were before. In every other bear market we saw people saying, “OK, it’s over” and closing things down. And there are some corporations that had a blockchain team and they didn’t continue. But you don’t see that in the big banks, you don’t see that in media and entertainment.

42411015,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvUNB,1681245975,"Bitcoin Cracks $30K, but for How Long?","Bitcoin (BTC) breaching $30,000 for the first time in 10 months answers questions about its resiliency while broaching new questions about its ability to hold its price at higher levels.  If the back half of 2022 represented the heart of crypto winter, the front half of 2023 has offered green shoots for optimistic bitcoin holders. Now the question for investors will be how long they can keep their coats off.  Taking a look at where we are now, BTC broke through $30,000 in early Asia trading hours and has been choppy through early U.S. trading.  Hourly volume implies conviction behind the move higher as it has largely surpassed its 20-day moving average. Daily volume appears poised to do the same.  The move to 10-month highs is significant, given crypto market turmoil since last May. The push effectively moves bitcoin to where it was prior to the implosions of Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and FTX, among others.  Where crypto is heading is a more exciting question at this point than where we have been, and reasonable explanations exist on both sides of the trade.  A bullish narrative is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will slow interest rate cuts later this year.  Each passing day, in fact, moves us closer to that event, with the current target rate of 4.75%-5% within range of a previously announced (but not concrete) target rate of 5%-5.25%.  Investor optimism will likely depend on Wednesday’s consumer price index report, with expectations that inflation rose 0.4% month over month. CPI falling by more than expected will likely generate rewards for bullish BTC investors.  But there appears to be a bearish divergence between bitcoin's price and its momentum, particularly if measuring since January. BTC has risen 45% since Jan. 14, but its 14-day Relative Strength Index has fallen 19%.  Given the contradiction of narratives, traders may ultimately turn to what is happening with BTC balances on exchanges.  An increased balance of BTC on exchanges can foreshadow price declines as traders position BTC to sell if needed. A decrease in balances can mean the opposite, with investors placing BTC into cold storage with the hope that it will rise.  There has been a slight increase of approximately 4,000 BTC on exchanges since March 31, representing $130 million in value. More notable than the increase is that this shift marked the end of a decreased balance that commenced March 19.  Given the recent $30,000 milestone, what happens next with balances may provide clues how investors view this move.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/11/bitcoin-cracks-30k-but-for-how-long,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7731faf1766392eb53d5053b2613aa01624c4599-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Within the last 24 hours, XLM experienced a close to 4% appreciation in value. However, on the weekly chart, Stellar did not observe any price increase. Nonetheless, the altcoin has finally surpassed its multi-week resistance level, and its technical outlook appears bullish at the time of writing. Related Reading: Why Is Ethereum (ETH) Still Trading Below $2,000? The buying strength and demand for XLM have surged as accumulation rose on the chart. Furthermore, the altcoin has increased above its bearish order block, previously below the $0.094 price mark. The demand must remain consistent on its chart since the overhead resistance mark remains crucial for the altcoin. Assuming that XLM surpasses the $0.100 price mark, it is likely that the recovery is underway. With Bitcoin increasing by 7% on its daily chart, other altcoins have also indicated positive price movements on their respective charts. Additionally, the market capitalization of XLM has registered an upward movement showing an increase in demand. Stellar Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, XLM was trading at $0.106. Buyers were activated as Stellar entered the $0.100 zone, and a move above the overhead resistance could take XLM to the overbought territory. The immediate resistance was $0.108, and breaking above this mark would pave the way for XLM to target $0.113. The amount of XLM traded during the last session was green, indicating increased buying strength. Conversely, support for Stellar stood at $0.102 and then at $0.098. If XLM falls below $0.098, it could bring the bears back. Technical Analysis Following its crossing of the $0.100 mark, the altcoin has recently experienced an upward movement on its chart. The Relative Strength Index was above the 60-mark, indicating strong demand on the chart. Similarly, XLM has risen above the 20-Simple Moving Average line as demand surges. These trends suggest that buyers are in control and are driving the price momentum in the market. Price reversal, however, could occur as the 200-SMA line may cross over the 50-SMA line, resulting in a death cross. This could cause the altcoin to dip on its chart. On the one-day chart, XLM has formed sell signals in line with a possible death cross. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence has depicted price momentum and reversal, with red signal bars indicating sell signals.

""This crypto rally has been built on the backs of the crypto community,"" Novogratz told CNBC. ""It's not been new money ... it's not been pension funds and asset managers coming in. It really was retail driven."" Novogratz, who attributes much of Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) fall from its 2021 heights above $60K to the Federal Reserve's aggressive raising of interest rates, added that ""some new people"" are joining the crypto space, leading to ""an uptick"" in Galaxy Digital's business. That said, Novogratz does not see this as a sign that the ""institutional pie has been growing."" Rather, the famed crypto investor believes turmoil in crypto space, such as the bankruptcy of major exchange FTX, has funneled many established crypto traders into the remaining institutions. ""I kind of think our uptick in business is coming because a lot of our competitors got wiped out,"" he said. The Galaxy Digital CEO stated that the market is experiencing a ""constructive rally"" due to a number of factors, including the belief that the Fed is finished or close to finishing hiking rates. Meanwhile, aggressive moves in Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi and Dubai to set up regulatory frameworks have provided increased confidence in crypto, leading to additional money flowing in from the region. When asked about Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Galaxy Digital's CEO claimed that it has a ""vibrant community,"" making it safer than other altcoins. ""I don't see a big sell-off in Ethereum coming,"" he concluded. Looking at Tuesday's intraday action in crypto space, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) climbed 3% to $30.12K while Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) edged up to around $1,900. Meanwhile, crypto-focused ETFs were benefitting from the upswing in Bitcoin prices.

This release or token unlocked will occur at 05:30 UTC tomorrow and could hurt APT’s price action. The upcoming unlocked tokens will be the fourth vested Aptos tokens in 2023. The first release occurred on January 11, with 4.5 million APT tokens unlocked. The second on February 12 and the third on March 12, releasing the same amount of 4.5 million tokens. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Registers Over 7% Gains In The Last 24 Hours. What’s Next? Millions of Aptos About To Be Released Into Circulation At current prices, a total of 4.5 million APT set to be released into circulation tomorrow is worth about $53 million. This amount is nearly 50% of the asset’s trading volume in the last 24 hours. Should a large amount worth of Aptos like that get released into circulation without readily available demand, a significant movement could be on the asset’s price chart. Notably, the amount of APT set to be released into circulation would push the asset’s circulating supply from its current $181 million at the time of writing to nearly above $186 million. The upcoming unlock is a part of the Aptos Foundation’s monthly token release. Vesting is a process where a certain amount of tokens are set aside and released gradually over some time rather than all at once. It is initiated via a smart contract that holds the tokens and specifies the conditions under which they will be released. The tokens are released to the founding team, community members, core contributors, and investors. As for the 4.5 million tokens set to be released tomorrow, 3.2 million will be allocated to the community, while 1.3 million will be distributed within the foundation. Usually, tokens sent to the foundation are used for development and research, market and community outreach, ecosystem support, staking, and governance. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Rises 21% In A Week As Launch Of Web 3 Game Draws Closer What Happens To APT’s Price? Looking back at the usual token unlock history, APT could experience short-term volatility or a price plummet based on whether a low demand is already on the ground after the token release tomorrow. In February, when the second vesting release occurred, APT saw a sharp decline in value, plummeting by over 5% daily. However, from a technical perspective, APT might record an upward trend after the unlock tomorrow, picking up from its rally today. On the 1-day time frame, the asset has formed a double bottom and is now set to shape a W pattern fully. In addition, Aptos has a major high liquidity, just above $14. Should APT continue its upward momentum and not invalidate the W pattern, APT could trade above $14 in the coming days. Meanwhile, over the past two weeks, Aptos has recorded an upward movement in its trading volume, indicating a possible accumulation. This means there might already be a readily available demand on the ground. Even if the circulating supply increases tomorrow, it might not significantly impact the Aptos market.

42411173,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQdd,1681233463,The New York Times' Skewed Bitcoin Mining Exposé Reveals Blatant Bias,"For much of March, rumors flew in crypto back channels that The New York Times was working on a major new exposé on cryptocurrency. It would, of course, focus on the only crypto topic the Times is truly interested in: the massive, apparently catastrophic energy cost of bitcoin mining.  That rumored hit piece arrived on Sunday, April 9, and it is profoundly strange. Its actual findings are stretched to fit a conclusion handed down, it seems clear, from the newspaper’s higher-ups. On its face, the piece is almost comically incoherent, but that very incoherence highlights its real message: Bitcoin is bad because we say it is.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  While the headline grandly declares it will expose “The Real-World Costs of the Digital Race for Bitcoin,” the bulk of the article’s factual findings seem to describe failures in a specific load-balancing incentive program in Texas. The program is offered by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, and is available to customers in any industry. The Times piece seems to take issue only with its use by bitcoin miners.  In the course of this critique, the report repeatedly indulges in wild non-sequiturs, some almost surrealistic in their juxtaposition of bitcoin (BTC) mining with unrelated negative events – “As beautiful as the chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating table.”  Put another way, this is journalism as an exercise in raw power: throwing disconnected facts under a tendentious headline and calling it a day.  Let’s talk about real problems  To be clear, I agree the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption, and energy consumption model, are less than ideal. The real problem – one not addressed directly in the Times’ piece – is that bitcoin mining has no inherent upper bound. In theory, it could spiral ever higher, though in practice it is reined in by real-world economics.  More generally, it would be great if Bitcoin used a lot less electricity, and that all of that power was zero-carbon. But that’s true of literally everything else in human life that uses power, which is ultimately where all these bitcoin mining hit pieces break down. The truth is many critiques of bitcoin mining are not critiques of power consumption, or their exclusive targeting of bitcoin would be obviously nonsensical. Instead, these pieces all rely on the implicit but unstated argument that Bitcoin has no fundamental utility. This unstated premise is intended to sneak entirely past readers’ critical defenses, as taken-for-granted as oxygen.  I further want to be clear that I respect the investigative work done by reporters and researchers here. They deliver some interesting facts and insights. But those were seemingly not enough to satisfy the agenda of Times higher-ups: Based on the text, it seems likely reporters were pressured to reshape their reporting into something it is not.  This is suggested by the bizarre opening anecdote, which recounts a Feb. 14, 2021, incident when the Texas power grid was struggling under the load of a winter storm. The apparent crime being recounted – the cardinal sin committed by bitcoin miners in this dire situation – was that they turned off so that more Texans could heat their homes.  Texas’ bitcoin miners turned off at this key moment at the request of Texas electrical authorities, and in compliance with one of a few load-balancing programs available to industrial Texas power customers (Bitdeer first signed an agreement with ERCOT in 2021). Anyone in the program can collect a fee for curtailing peak energy usage. In this case, a Bitdeer facility collected $18 million over four days.  See also: Bitcoin Mining Is Good for the Energy Grid and Good for the Environment  The article’s sweeping claims that “the public pays the price” for bitcoin mining largely hinge on this single state program. The article’s problem with bitcoin mining, if you can really call it that, appears to be that miners are too good at doing the thing that the Texas incentives are designed to encourage – turning off at times of peak load.  The point of those incentives is to keep the entire grid healthy, but the article frames it as some sort of nefarious manipulation. More to the point, it uses an isolated, in fact quite unique example – Texas – to support much broader claims that the Bitcoin network is raising energy prices across America.  This exemplifies the basic problem with the piece. The reporters may have uncovered genuine questions about the structure of incentives available to large-scale power customers in Texas. Maybe they’re unfairly lucrative for bitcoin miners compared to customers that can’t switch off as quickly or completely. But instead of addressing a real issue, this finding has been manhandled to support the (in fact non-falsifiable) argument that bitcoin mining consumes too much energy.  Notably, the piece does not meaningfully explore why the Texas program is structured the way it is in the first place. I’m not going to do their homework for them, but it seems reasonable to assume it is because Texas’ power grid, overseen by ERCOT, is a technical and regulatory basket case. It is held together by bailing wire and duct tape after decades of libertarian deregulation that led public and private power companies to starve their systems of investment, both in halted expansion and deferred maintenance.  The clear goal here is to associate the Bitdeer bitcoin mine with the decline of Rockdale.  The Texas power grid is also uniquely isolated from the rest of the U.S. electricity grid. This suggests the price effects documented by the Times would be more acute in Texas than elsewhere because the Texas grid cannot access backup electricity across state lines. This unique feature of the Texas power grid is not mentioned a single time in an article purporting to be a deep analysis of its workings.  It’s the kind of system that requires you to pay customers for not using it too much. A truly daring thinker might argue that’s the real problem here.  A thought-terminating exercise  The piece’s methods for covering over this kind of logical failure are bizarrely slapdash, as entries in this genre go. Let’s look particularly at the conclusion. This is one of the strangest closing paragraphs to a news or investigative article I have ever read.  In Rockdale, where two of the largest mines in the country operate just outside the city limits, the city manager, Barbara Holly, told The Times that that town used to be “a fairly wealthy little community.” She said that changed when a large industrial plant that had provided thousands of jobs closed more than a decade ago. “It just cut the legs out from under this community,” she said.  The clear goal here is to associate the Bitdeer bitcoin mine with the decline of Rockdale, but the framing is brazenly untruthful and clumsily delivered. Elsewhere, the article alludes to the fact that bitcoin mines don’t create a lot of jobs, but this paragraph seems to imply that the mining facility is somehow to blame for the departure of an aluminum smelter that “closed more than a decade ago.”  That is, the smelter quite likely closed before Bitcoin was invented. It is certainly sad that this “cut the legs out of the community.” But in what possible way is that relevant to the story being told here about bitcoin – other than to emotionally manipulate readers into associating the two?  This is, as presented, just sloppy writing – if I were editing this piece, I would draw a big angry red line, or its Google Docs equivalent, around this paragraph. But I don’t think that’s the kind of rigor editors brought to bear here: More likely, they nudged this tortuous malapropism into existence.  Extra! Extra! Demand for electricity raises the price!  I’m not here to drag you through a point-by-point rebuttal of the Times piece, but let’s look at one more example of the word games being played here by America’s paper of record.  The New York Times has identified 34 such large-scale operations, known as Bitcoin mines, in the United States, all putting immense pressure on the power grid and most finding novel ways to profit from doing so. Their operations can create costs — including higher electricity bills and enormous carbon pollution — for everyone around them, most of whom have nothing to do with Bitcoin.  This paragraph exemplifies the tendentious nature of this piece – that is, the fact that while it is fact-based reporting, its real goal is to advance an agenda. In this paragraph, the piece pursues its agenda by finding the most maniacal, ominous-sounding possible way to describe “being an electricity consumer.”  “Putting immense pressure on the power grid” is another way of saying “buying lots of power.” “Finding novel ways to profit” from buying power is another way of saying “running a business that uses electricity to operate and/or participating in the energy market.”  See also: David Z. Morris – We Can Use as Much Energy as We Want, Forever | Opinion  The most brazenly disingenuous claim here is that bitcoin miners create “higher electricity bills … for everyone around them.” This is another way of saying “purchasing electricity in a capitalist economy results in higher prices for other consumers.” When I turn on my toaster, I am also in fact creating higher electricity bills for everyone around me.

While still nowhere near the volumes of last year, things have been picking up with NFTs. According to a report from online store for decentralized applications (dapp) DappRadar, the NFT market had a 137% increase in trading volume during the first quarter of this year. Despite a slight decrease of over 15% during March, the ecosystem reached $4.7 billion in total value for the first quarter.  New and emerging online marketplaces such as Blur led a substantial increase in the overall trading volume during the ecosystem’s first quarter. Garzik said projects like Blur are “fantastic” in that they will drive market competition, and are likely to “force other competitors in the market to improve and to get better.”  Garzik said that a lot of the NFT hype appears to have finally “burned off,” and users now are looking for NFTs that can provide real utility, something that users can engage with and that will attract their attention.  “The [NFT] hype comes, it goes, and as that water washes out to sea, what is left are the higher quality projects,” he said.

Bitcoin Investors Are Showing High Levels Of Euphoria Currently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, euphoria in the market is currently significantly more than what was observed following the break above the $25,000 level last month. The indicator of interest here is the “Social Volume,” which tells us about the degree of discussion that’s taking place around a specific topic (like Bitcoin or the cryptocurrency market in general). This metric makes this measurement by counting the total number of social media text documents that mention the given keyword. The social media text documents here refer to a collection of data sourced from social media websites like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram. Related Reading: Chainlink Investors Show Pessimism, Break Incoming? Something to note about the indicator is that it doesn’t measure how many mentions the term is getting on social media, but rather how many of the text documents contain it at least once. For example, if a Reddit thread mentions “Bitcoin” five times, the post will still only contribute one unit towards BTC’s Social Volume. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Social Volume for the cryptocurrency market specifically filtered for terms related to Bitcoin’s break above the $30,000 level: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high over the past day | Source: Santiment on Twitter As shown in the above graph, to get only the Social Volume for discussions related to the Bitcoin price breakout, these terms have been chosen by the analytics firm: $30k, 30k, $30,000, and 30,000. It looks like the indicator’s value has seen a massive spike for these terms during the last day. This obviously makes sense, as any sudden price movements such as the one being seen now generally get the asset under the spotlight, and with such attention naturally follow discussions on social media. Related Reading: How To Trade Bitcoin Ahead Of Tomorrow’s CPI Release? Analysts Weigh In The scale of the spike, however, is still extraordinarily large here and shows how hyped investors are about this rally. In the chart, Santiment has also displayed the Social Volume for $25,000-related terms, to showcase how the current spike compares with the earlier break above that level. It’s clearly visible that the Social Volume spike seen during the surge above $25,000 last month was quite a bit smaller than the one observed this time. Back then, the price continued to rise beyond the level for a while, but it eventually hit a local top and tumbled back down. Such a high amount of hype is usually a sign that euphoria is building up among the investors, which is something that has historically led to the cryptocurrency observing a pullback. As euphoria could be hitting the market once again right now, it’s possible that the coin may see a retreat below the $30,000 mark. However, a pullback, if one happens, doesn’t necessarily have to last for too long, as BTC was able to bounce back from the $25,000 hype top quickly enough.

Bitcoin is the largest blockchain, and there is a lot of value in expanding its efficiency. I am looking to add STX on the next pullback. Overview Proposals to add scalability to Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bring up contentious debates in the Bitcoin community. Attempts to make Bitcoin scale by increasing its block size have led to splits from the Bitcoin network and the creation of new Bitcoin variants, known as hard forks. However, other blockchain networks have emerged that are scalable and do a lot more than send and receive peer-to-peer transactions. Advanced blockchain features have proven helpful in building decentralized applications (dApps). Bitcoin inherently lacks advanced features like smart contracts execution and self-executing contracts. As one of the most secure and decentralized blockchain networks, the Bitcoin community largely frowns upon implementing changes to the Bitcoin network. These changes often result in a trade-off between the network’s security and scalability. Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea started the Stacks ( STX-USD ) project (initially called Blockstack) as a blockchain layer for Bitcoin. Stacks is the first blockchain project to receive a token sale approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), making STX, Stacks' native token, regulatory compliant in the US. What Makes Up Stacks’ Tech Stack? Stack implements novel technologies that unlock the full potential of Bitcoin. To achieve faster throughput and programmability on the Bitcoin blockchain, Stacks uses a set of technologies that anchors the Bitcoin network. Proof of Transfer (PoX) Stacks uses the proof-of-transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism, which it calls ""an extension of the proof-of-burn mechanism,"" and a layer on top of the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. An underlying PoW blockchain secures a PoX blockchain; therefore, Nodes that secure a PoX blockchain earn rewards in the cryptocurrency of the base blockchain. A PoX network's base blockchain is sometimes called its anchor chain, as they are anchored to a PoW network. Stacks' anchor chain is Bitcoin. Miners on Stacks' PoX blockchain get BTC rewards. When stackers stake STX, they earn rewards in Stacks' anchor cryptocurrency BTC. The Stacks team says it chose Bitcoin as its anchor blockchain because the Bitcoin network is the oldest blockchain network, and it has stood the test of time. Bitcoin is also one of the most decentralized blockchain networks, and its native coin BTC has become the most recognized cryptocurrency. Microblocks for High Throughput Stacks uses a mechanism called microblocks to achieve increased transaction throughput. Stacks’ block creation time (block time) is at the same rate as that of the Bitcoin network; however, microblocks allow the Stacks blockchain to perform state transition between blocks of the anchor chain. Block leaders are elected on the Stacks network to batch or stream transactions. In the streaming model, elected block leaders select transactions from the mempool and package them into microblocks. Using this approach, the transaction processing time is reduced. Miners on Stack are incentivized to mine microblocks. Miners can choose not to mine macroblocks but opt for the batching model. Clarity Programming Language Stacks has a proprietary smart contract language designed for its blockchain. Smart Contract developers encode business logic on the Ethereum (ETH-USD) blockchain using the Solidity smart contract language, and web3 developers building on Stacks use Clarity. Stacks says that in designing Clarity, it looked at the flaws and vulnerabilities of existing smart contract languages like Solidity. Drawing from the lessons learned from common Solidity exploits, Clarity was built to be secure by design. Clarity is an interpreted smart contract language, unlike Solidity, a compiled language. Compiled languages are converted to byte-code before they are submitted on-chain. This poses a certain level of vulnerability as the compiler adds another layer of complexity. A compiler bug may cause the execution of an unintended byte-code, creating the risk of an exploit. Clarity, as an interpreted smart contract language, executes and commits to the chain as written. Byte-codes, the format in which compiled smart contract codes are converted, is low-level and non-readable by humans. This makes verifying exactly what a smart contract does at runtime difficult. An interpreted language like Clarity maintains its high-level, human-readable format, making verifying what a smart contract does easy. What Has Been Built on Stacks Layer-2? A blockchain network that offers NFT, DeFi, and smart contract capabilities can prove its worthiness by the number of real-world applications that have been built on its blockchain. NFTs, DeFi, and Crypto Domains on Stacks NFTs are tradable on Stacks’ NFT marketplaces. The popular Stacks NFT marketplaces are Gamma, Byzantion, Stacks Art, and Superfandom. Some of Stacks’ NFTs marketplaces offer cross-chain features. NFTs on the Stacks blockchain are generally called Bitcoin NFTs. Some popular Bitcoin NFT collections include Bitcoin Monkeys, Megapont Ape Club, and Belle’s Witches . DeFi functionalities such as lending and the launch of tokens have been made available on the Bitcoin network, thanks to Stack’s layer-2 solution. Stackswap is a Stacks-based DeFi platform that enables users to exchange tokens, mint and trade NFTs, and perform crypto lending on the Bitcoin network. Stacks has also introduced Web3 domain names to Bitcoin. Like Ethereum Name Service, Stacks’ “.BTC” domain enables users to encapsulate their Web3 identity into a simple, easily-readable address format. Technical Analysis My long-term target for STX would take us at least into the $5.4 region: STX long-term (Author's work) This is the 1.618 ext of wave 1, using the arithmetic chart, since I see the log chart as too bullish. Still, this represents a rally of at least 400%. In the more immediate term, I believe STX has already completed an impulse to the upside, and we should now see a significant retracement: STX short-term analysis (author's work) I am adding a buy order at $0.756 Takeaway There are several layer-2 protocols built on Bitcoin; however, Stacks’ approach of enabling advanced features instead of focusing mainly on scaling makes it stand out. Bitcoin is undoubtedly the most popular blockchain network. When retail and institutional investors discuss crypto investment, Bitcoin is the number choice. Stacks' use of Bitcoin as its anchor chain already makes it stand on the shoulders of giants. As crypto continues to gain mass adoption and more institutional investors add Bitcoin to their portfolios, the need for asset tokenization, NFTs, and DeFi features on the Bitcoin network will become apparent. Stacks has begun an awesome journey to unlock Bitcoin’s full potential.",POSITIVE,BTC | STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | STX | ENS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4593458-stacks-bitcoin-layer2-could-be-huge?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11652525.jpeg

42387739,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQrHyn,1681229227,What’s Next After Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade?,"As Ethereum nears this week’s much-anticipated Shanghai upgrade, investors and blockchain developers are already mapping out the blockchain’s next steps after it completes the transition to a fully functioning proof-of-stake network.  The upgrade is sometimes referred to as ""Shapella"" because the planned changes to the blockchain's execution layer are collectively known as ""Shanghai,"" while changes to the consensus layer are known as Capella. (Shanghai + Capella = Shapella. Get it?) The ensemble is changes are expected to go into effect on Wednesday around 6:30 p.m. ET (22:30 UTC), enabling withdrawals of staked ether for the first time.  It can seem like Ethereum is always in a state of development. Almost as soon as the blockchain completed its ""Merge"" upgrade in September, another key milestone in the transition to proof-of-stake, developers started focusing on Shapella.  Now that staking, an integral part of ensuring the security of the blockchain, will be complete, here’s what experts say Ethereum observers can expect in the coming months and years on the second-largest blockchain.  EIP-4844, proto-danksharding and ‘blobs’  Sharding, a concept aimed at increasing Ethereum’s scalability through more-efficient data storage, is starting to make its way toward reality.  Originally drawn from computer science, sharding splits the blockchain into smaller pieces, known as “shards,” in essence creating multiple mini-blockchains. Think of it like adding lanes to a highway: More cars have space to maneuver so there’s less congestion. On Ethereum, splitting the network into shards can allow for more space to process transactions and therefore lower ""gas,"" or fee rates.  Danksharding does the same thing, but instead of using the shards to increase the number of transactions on Ethereum, it does so to increase space for groups of data, or “blobs,” allowing more data to be processed (which will be especially helpful for lowering transactions costs for layer 2 companion chains).  EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, is the first prototype for danksharding, expected to hit Ethereum’s mainnet sometime in the third quarter of this year.  To kick off the march to that milestone, Ethereum developers have released what they're calling the KZG Ceremony – a coordinated “public ritual” that will provide a foundation for proto-danksharding. This ceremony is needed to kick-start the process of bringing proto-danksharding into the protocol.  “If EIP-4844 is a car, this KZG commitment scheme that we're helping to construct is the engine,” said Trent van Epps, a protocol generalist at the Ethereum Foundation. “This random string of letters and numbers is like helping to kick-start this engine.”  Read more: Scaling Ethereum Beyond the Merge: Danksharding  The Verge, the Purge, the Scourge  In November, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, released an updated road map, a set of issues to be tackled.  After EIP-4844 comes what’s known as the “Verge,” where Verkle trees will be introduced, another move to increase scalability.  Verkle trees will allow developers to store large amounts of data, and users only need to show a single piece, or a short proof, of that data to verify they have a root of that tree. Verkle trees will make data proofs much more efficient, though this is still a new concept in cryptography and not yet widely used.  The “Purge” will purge the spare, or historical data, from the Ethereum network. By getting rid of this historical data, congestion on the network will decrease, allowing for more transactions to be processed. Buterin has said that after this phase Ethereum should be able to process around 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), up from about 29 TPS now.  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?  Buterin added the “Scourge” as the latest element for Ethereum to tackle, in an effort to make the blockchain a credible and neutral place for transaction inclusion, while simultaneously avoiding centralization around MEV.  MEV, or maximal extractible value, is the profit that comes from rearranging or including certain transactions within a block. MEV bots are used by searchers to maximize MEV, typically by front-running trades or carrying out other malicious attacks that extract large profits away from regular users.  Flashbots, an Ethereum research and development organization, came up with MEV-Boost, a software aimed at equalizing MEV for validators and making it easy for them to get a piece from the MEV cake. But Flashbots suffered backlash after announcing in August it would censor Tornado Cash transactions after the U.S. Treasury sanctions of the privacy mixer.  Part of the Scourge’s aim would be to address these censorship and MEV issues through proposer-builder separation (PBS) embedded in the protocol. PBS would separate building and proposing blocks into two different roles. Buterin suggests adding “inclusion lists” to prevent block builders from censoring transactions in the future.  So if you thought that Ethereum was through with major upgrades, just stick around.

42411164,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQ6Z,1681228900,Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade Will Permanently Alter ETH Economics,"An Ethereum transformation is on the horizon, and no one is sure how the market will respond. In time the “Shanghai” upgrade may be remembered as a uniquely bullish event for ether (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market value.  In the short term, however, a number of the world’s leading Ethereum quant traders who historically have outperformed ETH staking yield believe price action will be neutral to potentially bearish due to the expected large increase in circulating supply of ETH after investors are finally able to withdraw their stakes.  James Hodges is the managing partner of Amphibian Capital, an ETH-based fund of funds.  Over a longer time horizon Ethereum’s total switch to proof-of-stake is likely to only benefit the network and ETH’s price – enough so to possibly dethrone bitcoin (BTC) as the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap.  Amphibian Capital, my firm, takes this logic further and predicts ETH may reign supreme as one of the world’s top three most valuable assets in the next decade. The Shanghai upgrade is a crucial step in that direction, which will likely increase liquidity and trading of ether and possibly attract more institutional capital into the crypto economy.  First, the Shanghai upgrade will enable users to participate in Ethereum's validation process through the implementation of the Beacon Chain mechanism, making staking more accessible and efficient. The Beacon Chain mechanism will democratize the staking process and allow for greater participation in the network, leading to increased security and decentralization of the network – a bullish sign.  Second, the “Merge” upgrade transitioned the Ethereum blockchain to a proof-of-stake consensus system, and the implementation of EIP-1559 turned ETH into a deflationary asset. EIP-1559 introduced a more predictable and stable transaction fee mechanism and enabled the burning of a portion of transaction fees. These features will continue to make ether even more deflationary, thereby increasing its value over time.  All of this lays the groundwork for increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. We are already seeing growing interest in ether from institutional investors who are increasingly looking to diversify their portfolios and hedge against inflationary pressures. The Merge upgrade addressed Ethereum’s ESG concerns that kept many investors out.  Once staking withdrawals are unlocked, institutions will be able to stake and earn a yield that will resemble fixed financial instruments such as bonds in traditional capital markets. After the Shanghai fork, staking yields from ether could be synonymous with the risk-free rate that traditional capital markets use to price their assets.  Investors may be scared off from the idea that the Shanghai upgrade could cause a large sell-off of ETH, some of which has been staked since 2020. However, data suggests this analysis is overstated.  CryptoQuant has noted that 60% of the staked ETH supply, or approximately 10.3 million ETH, is currently at a loss. Meanwhile, Lido DAO, the largest Ethereum staking provider, holds 30% of all staked ETH at an average loss of $1,000. Typically, selling pressure arises when participants have large profits, which is not the case for staked ETH currently. This suggests there may be limited selling pressure on the Ethereum market in the near term.  Furthermore, as reported by Santiment, nearly 90% of all supply of ETH is in self-custody. Holders of crypto have been increasingly moving towards self-custody since September 2022. When the FTX exchange collapsed in November the trend accelerated, leading to a massive drop in ETH supplies on exchanges. This reduces immediate sell pressure as capital moves to the sidelines, and future sell-offs are expected to be limited.  See also: Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade Will Help Layer 2 Networks, Investor Says  As cryptocurrency continues to evolve, investors are constantly seeking new ways to accumulate more ether. Currently yields on liquid staking provider Lido sit at 5.4% APR. There is also the option to become a solo validator on the Ethereum network, which requires users to invest 32 ETH. Others choose boutique systems such as investing in ETH-denominated quantitative hedge funds, which offer higher rewards in exchange for more risk and fees.  All of these strategies have their pros and cons, and it ultimately comes down to personal preference and risk tolerance. It is important to thoroughly research and understand the potential risks and rewards before making any investment decisions.  In either case, we at Amphibian Capital remain extremely bullish on ETH’s long-term prospects, both from an ecosystem perspective as well as a price and market cap perspective.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | LDO,James Hodges,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/11/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-will-permanently-alter-eth-economics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a9b2217a66a48f416269858f5a23709a5383a6f-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Shibburn noted that the Shiba Inu Community had burned a total of 1,178,830,489 Shiba Inu tokens over the past 7 days. The tokens were burned through 26 different transactions within the period. The top contributor to the burn was a new token on the ShibaSwapDEX Koyo. Shibburn data revealed that Koyo moved a whopping 1,104,224,812 Shiba Inu to the dead wallet on Sunday, April 9. It completed the transaction in a single transaction to set a new record level in burning Shiba Inu tokens. Also, on March 17, the new token burned 924.15 million SHIB through a single transaction. Shiba Inu’s price action has been on the lower turn amid its huge token-burning feats. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.0000111, indicating a surge of 0.09% over the past 24 hours. However, its price action over the past 7 days shows a drop of 2.68%. According to CoinMarketCap, Shiba Inu ranks as the 14th top crypto coin with a market cap of $6.54 billion. Its market dominance is 0.53%, and a 24-hour trading volume of $174.21 million.

Powell also said Maple is planning to hold a community vote later this year about new tokenomics and utility for its native token, MPL.  MPL rallied 23% ahead of the community call, which CoinDesk attended.  The developments come as the platform is recovering from a disastrous year for crypto lending that was plagued with insolvencies of borrowers. After the FTX exchange’s sudden implosion in November Maple experienced $36 million of credit defaults, causing hefty losses for liquidity providers.  The total value locked (TVL) on the protocol, a popular metric in decentralized finance, dropped to $40 million from $930 million last May, per data by DefiLlama. The MPL token plummeted to as low as $4 from an all-time high of $68.2 last April.  Read more: Maple Finance's $54M of Sour Debt Shows Risks of Crypto Lending Without Collateral  Maple released an upgraded version of its platform late last year and started a new tax receivables lending pool last month as part of the protocol’s effort to position itself as a credit platform connecting traditional finance and blockchain technology.  “Real-world asset lending is going to be a huge trend,” Powell said during the call.  The upcoming pool will allow accredited investors and corporate treasuries based outside of the U.S. to invest their stablecoin holdings in U.S. Treasury bonds and earn a yield.  The protocol expects demand for the pool because crypto investors are looking for yields in traditional assets such as government bonds, while trust in banking facilities has decreased after recent bank implosions in the U.S.  Read more: SVB Collapse Shows the Rot in U.S. Banking and Dollars  Maple is also working on additions to its lending offerings, Powell said during the call.

Wyoming Attorney General Bridget Hill filed a motion with the U.S. District Court in Wyoming asking for permission to intervene in Custodia Bank’s lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Board and the Kansas City Fed (whose jurisdiction includes Wyoming) for delaying and ultimately denying the crypto-friendly bank’s application for a master account and membership with the Fed.  Though the Wyoming-based bank’s applications were denied in January, 18 months after the application was first filed, the Federal Reserve Board only made public its reasoning for the denial in an eviscerating 86-page report last month. The report condemned Custodia’s proposed business plan in every single category the Fed assesses, and claimed the decision not to federally insure deposits and Custodia’s dependence on a vibrant crypto market made it a danger to itself and its customers.  Custodia CEO Caitlin Long, who helped draft Wyoming’s crypto laws, has been vocal in her pushback against the Fed’s decision, citing Custodia’s proposal to be fully capitalized, holding $1.08 in cash for every dollar deposited by customers, and suggesting the real reason for denial is a Fed conspiracy to cut crypto off from the banking system.  But the battle between Custodia and the Fed is not just about crypto – it’s also about the dual banking system in the U.S., which allows banks to charter under either federal or state law.  Custodia was granted a SPDI charter from the state of Wyoming in October 2020. But, the motion argues, the Fed didn’t see that as good enough to grant Custodia membership.  “The Custodia Master Account Summary Analysis the Kansas City Fed provided Custodia makes it clear that its view of perceived inadequacies in Wyoming’s laws and regulations for SPDIs is partially responsible for its denial,” the report said.  Hill argued that, though Wyoming wasn’t taking a position on whether or not Custodia was entitled to a master account, it is necessary for the state to intervene to defend “the legitimacy and viability of the State’s statutory framework.”  “Although an adverse determination against Custodia on the merits of Custodia’s application and unique situation may not prejudice the State, the Defendants’ apparent determination that Wyoming’s SPDI statutes and regulations, and SPDI banks themselves, are deficient will,” Hill’s report argued.  The report points out the prejudice of the Fed’s skepticism about new state-chartered banks, like Custodia, and their involvement in the digital assets space while allowing “old” state-chartered banks, such as New York-based BNY Mellon, “to engage in substantially the same digital asset custody activity Wyoming SPDIs intend to engage in.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/11/wyoming-defends-legitimacy-of-its-crypto-charter-framework-in-custodia-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acaa307420041c03ab8a33615f3d3baca5253ff9-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ongoing market-wide rally has empowered most coins to recover their lost price gains, with Bitcoin adding over 6.57% in seven days. However, among the top coins, Solana scored the most gains, rallying over 10% in the last 24 hours. The gain places Solana (SOL) at the 10th position among top-gaining cryptocurrencies today. Solana’s current price rally comes after three consecutive days of price decline. Solana Price Action Over The Past Weeks Solana (SOL) performed considerably well over the past seven days, registering parallel gains on the weekly and monthly charts. The token has recorded a 9.8% increase in price over the past seven days, with a 14-day rally of 12.4%. Related Reading: Why Is Ethereum (ETH) Still Trading Below $2,000? That’s not all. Historical data shows that SOL is among the cryptocurrencies that witnessed incredible rallies this year. SOL’s price has more than doubled over the last three months after opening the year at $9.96. The coin price rapidly rose from less than $10 at the start of January to $25.58 on January 20, an over 150% increase within three weeks. SOL met some slight pullbacks before hitting another milestone at $26.18 on January 29. Solana continued with random rise and fall, typical of all cryptocurrencies, with a downturn in March, bringing its price down to $17.33 on March 9. However, it quickly recovered momentum, rising to nearly $23 on March 21 before another pullback below $20 on the 27th. Despite the ups and downs, SOL shows bullish signs, indicating that another major rally could be imminent. Solana Price Rallies With Bullish Sentiments A Day Before US CPI Data Release The recent rise in price could be due to investors’ optimism about the upcoming US inflation data. Players in the crypto and financial markets anticipate the March Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release on April 12. As economists predicted, previous CPI data came out lower than the preceding (January) data. With that thought, investors are optimistic that the March report would be even lower and could influence the US Fed to relax its hawkish interest rates hike. The investor sentiment in the crypto market is currently bullish, with the Fear and Greed Index at 68, indicating greed. As the global crypto market cap increased by 4.8%, the bullish sentiment rubbed off on most coins, including SOL. SOL and other cryptocurrencies could be up for more gains should the CPI data come out lower tomorrow, as expected. At press time, Solana (SOL) is trading at $22.39, a 10.4% increase from its past day’s price. Its trading volume is over 300% higher in the last 24 hours, reflecting increasing trading activities as bullish investors dominate the market.

42411182,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLR45,1681224302,"First-Quarter Performance Recap: CoinDesk Market Index Up 58%, BTC Gains Amid Banking Crisis","It’s been quite a start to the year in the world of crypto. Bitcoin (BTC) posted its best quarterly performance in over two years, gaining 68%, for the first three months of 2023. The broader CoinDesk Market Index, or CMI – which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization – is up 58% on the quarter with ether (ETH) and cardano (ADA) up 50% and 57% over the same period.  Todd Groth is head of research at CoinDesk Indices, a provider of digital asset indices since 2014.  The computing sector, or CPU (+67%), benefited from the positive sentiment surrounding artificial intelligence sparked by the the debut of ChatGPT last November. The currency sector, or CCY (+63%), benefited from the U.S. regional bank jitters and from the expansion across central bank balance sheets. January’s rebound in investor sentiment (see “January Effect”) has provided buoyancy for the broad market after a challenging 2022. Digitization, or BTZ (+24%), and DeFi, or DCF (+43%), are also positive for the year.  So where do we go from here?  Digital assets tend to do best when they trade according to their own narrative (say like bitcoin’s inflation hedge thesis) and decouple from the factors and themes driving traditional asset classes.  So far in 2023, crypto appears to be bucking trends driving stocks and bonds, including 2022 inflation fears and quantitative-tightening at the Federal Reserve. Digital assets have less in common now with growth-oriented equities, with a lowering of correlation between digital assets and equities. Within bitcoin specifically, we're also seeing a strengthening in the correlation with gold (positive) and the U.S. dollar (negative). The “digital gold” and fiat “currency debasement hedge” narratives re-emerge and regain investor consideration.  Bonds  Bitcoin’s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed partly to the steepening of the yield curve in the bond market.  We continue to see a moderately negative relationship between bitcoin price changes and the yield curve slope (using the five-year to the 30-year yield spread as proxies), which is a market-derived proxy for interest-rate expectations based on U.S. Treasury bond pricing. The recent peak in U.S. yield curve inversion of +46 basis points on March 8, just before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tumbled to -15 basis points as of March 27 as the market priced in fewer rate hikes and cuts post-SVB.  This 60 basis-point drop in yield curve slope (with five-year rates dropping more than 30-year rates, bull steeping), combined with the negative correlation of -0.4 between the yield curve slope and bitcoin, suggests one-third of bitcoin’s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed to the steepening of the yield curve.  This relationship between bitcoin and the yield curve strengthened during the Silicon Valley Bank event, supporting the digital gold narrative.  With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continuing to expand, in a mere two weeks the new lending facilities created to mitigate the regional banking crisis in March have undone months of balance sheet tightening. The Fed’s actions come alongside continued monetary stimulus coming from the Bank of Japan (buying domestic bonds to maintain yield curve control) and the People’s Bank of China, which is stimulating an economy weakened by COVID lockdowns.  From the perspective of a digitally scarce asset like bitcoin, these are all encouraging developments. But it’s unlikely we are heading for a halcyon redux of 2021’s crypto bull market  The U.S. regional banking concerns and the rapid unwind of Credit Suisse (CS) have highlighted weaknesses in the traditional financial system when interest rates rise. While this may come to the delight or amusement of crypto maximalists and critics of the fractionalized banking system, it is a source for further deleveraging contagion risk. Most digital-asset investments share a broader portfolio with traditional public and private-asset markets, with capital allocation decisions within these portfolios linking these disparate markets together through relative value choices which promote and drive correlations across markets. Crypto cannot sail alone.  That the Fed will make fewer hikes, and more rate cuts, is pretty much priced into the market now and reflected in the yield curve steepening mentioned above. That has benefited bitcoin and gold, and at the expense of the U.S. dollar.  A portion of these rate expectations might be due to the move of investors out of banking deposits and into front-end Treasurys for corporate treasury risk-management purposes. Why hold deposits at a regional bank, when you can earn similar interest in short-term paper without the credit risk of a potentially shaky bank?  That said, the market appears to view the collapse of SVB as a pivot in the interest-rate hiking cycle. If the tightening of credit conditions and lending standards begin to percolate through the economy and inflation cools down further, then the Federal Reserve will no longer have to hike rates as the credit markets have effectively tightened financial conditions on the Fed’s behalf.  But if inflation remains persistent and elevated, the Fed will have to go against market pricing and continue to hike, which has the potential of triggering a redux of 2013's ""Taper Tantrum"" and the liquidation risk mentioned above.  Liquidity in crypto markets has dropped with trading volumes post-FTX. Until prices rise enough to reignite interest from traders who exited the market in 2022, we don't expect it to improve. With U.S. regulatory action against exchanges and the closure of a number of banks providing crypto on-ramping services, additional hurdles remain for capital entering into the digital-asset market these days.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/11/crypto-q1-2023-performance-recap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99f19d22ca2150205efcf5ae863979e8de3ce792-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In its ""Global Financial Stability Report"" published Tuesday, the IMF joins the standard setters at the Financial Stability Board in calling for consistent international regulation of the cryptocurrency sector after a year that has seen a number of collapses of major exchanges and crypto-linked banks.  “The collapse of multiple entities in the crypto asset ecosystem has again made the call more urgent for comprehensive and consistent regulation and adequate supervision” focused on protecting consumers and corporate governance, the report said.  The report added that regulations should cover crypto storage, transfer, exchange and custody of reserves, with extra prudential requirements for those carrying out multiple functions and for the issuers of stablecoins – tokens that seek to maintain their value versus fiat currencies.  The report cites a “rough year for crypto,” in which the collapse of crypto- and tech-heavy lenders Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks followed from the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange in November. “These events add to questions about the viability of digital assets and reinforce the need for appropriate regulation,” the IMF said.  The IMF’s report followed a warning issued earlier Tuesday by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that financial authorities need to be able to monitor crypto leverage, decentralized finance and crypto staking and lending.  ""Crypto-assets have experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the future development path of this market is uncertain,” said a statement by the ESRB, a watchdog agency chaired by the European Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde.  The Financial Stability Board, a grouping of international regulators, is due to issue its own crypto rules in July, and its head, Klaas Knot, has already said many existing stablecoins would be unlikely to meet its strictures. Many traditional finance players want to see curbs on crypto conglomerates because the mixing of different financial functions could lead to conflicts of interest, despite concerns about constraining innovation.  The IMF’s Executive Board has previously expressed concerns over the potential of crypto to usurp the role of legal tender, though it stopped short of calling for an outright ban on digital assets.

RSS3 aims to be a bridge between blockchain technology and AI, search engines and social media. It has previously attracted investment from Coinbase, Dragonfly and noted entrepreneur and former Andreessen Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan.  The protocol's latest investment follows its unveiling of RSS3 AIOP, an AI training environment providing Web3 information to the likes of ChatGPT.  Traders have been betting on the potential of artificial intelligence and crypto, following the recent rise in popularity of AI-driven chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generation software DALL-E. While these do not actually use blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, crypto traders have nonetheless been drawn to AI-focused tokens as the next big growth area.  ""We believe RSS3 is perfectly positioned to empower developers to create diverse, cutting-edge applications that will redefine how we interact with the web3 ecosystem,"" DWF Labs' managing partner Andrei Grachev said.  RSS3's token has a market cap of just under $60 million at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data.  The $10 million purchase by DWF Labs is the firm's tenth investment of at least $10 million into crypto and Web3 projects in less than two months.

However, recent data shows that bullish sentiment is returning. But, the ADA price is facing one last key challenge to start a major rally. A look at the 1-day chart of ADA reveals that the price managed to break the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.396 to the upside today. The 200 day EMA is traditionally used to indicate the long-term trend and is considered a bear/bull boundary line. At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.408, but is still facing probably its biggest challenge in recent weeks: the resistance area between $0.42 and $0.43. This zone served as the strongest support from May to October 2022. Since the area was breached to the downside on October 11, 2022, ADA price has failed to close above this area on the 1-day chart. Several attempts in October 2022 and February 2023 failed. A recapture of this price level would be of major importance and could trigger a rally towards $0.60. Cardano (ADA) Fundamentals Look Impressive The fundamentals confirm the bullish trend for Cardano. Analyst Ali Martinez reported in a tweet yesterday that ADA whales are on a shopping spree. In the last 2 weeks, they have purchased 560 million ADA tokens worth $218.4 million. This suggests that ADA has become more attractive to larger investors again after the price started showing signs of recovery. A notable success has also been pointed out by ADA community member Darren. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Draws Attention As Whales Accumulate 560 Million Tokens According to Messari’s data, Cardano has the highest transaction volume of any blockchain in the last 24 hours, ahead of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The volume was $10.82 billion. In the same period, Bitcoin had a transaction volume of $6.8 billion and Ethereum of $1.86 billion. However, there is a twist to the stats. According to Messari, only 51,215 addresses were responsible for this volume, while Bitcoin (936,122 addresses) and Ethereum (518,857 addresses) had much higher user numbers. One putative reason could be whale transactions, as Martinez also acknowledged. This would also go along with the news from Grayscale.

The funding will help accelerate Sei Labs’ growth, including a deeper expansion into the Asia-Pacific region.  Investors included Jump Crypto, Distributed Global, Multicoin Capital, Asymmetric Capital Partners, Flow Traders, Hypersphere Ventures and Bixin Ventures. The post-money valuation stands at $800 million, the company told TechCrunch.  Sei is an open-source layer 1 blockchain that is designed to allow decentralized exchanges and trading apps to offer users a fast and easy way to trade assets. Sei’s public test network went live on March 13 and has attracted more than 3.6 million unique users since then, according to the company.  The funding comes as investments in the crypto industry remain constrained by the bear market, though blockchain infrastructure projects have proven one of the most resilient categories.  “Infrastructure and applications historically come in cycles – Ethereum and the last generation of public blockchains led to a Cambrian explosion of new decentralized apps over the past two years. Among those apps, exchanges and trading have achieved the clearest product-market-fit, but are held back by outdated layer 1 blockchains.

What’s important to note is that the number of coins that have remained dormant over the last two years has been rising. Glassnode data shows that it is at the highest level at current levels. Related Reading: Bugs Discovered On Ordinals Protocol As Bitcoin Rips Above $30,000 A level deeper, Pompliano noticed that over 29% of all BTC in circulation, translating to a market capitalization of over $159 billion, has not been moved over the last five years. Meanwhile, about 15% of BTC has not been moved over the last decade. The coins that have not been moved over during this time, Pompliano notes, roughly equates to 15% or the over 2.5 million BTC assumed to be permanently lost or irretrievable. Unlike fiat transactions, the immutable nature of Bitcoin means once transactions have been confirmed on-chain, they cannot be reversed. Over the years, millions of coins have been lost, and many assume they cannot be recovered. This includes the big batch of coins mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin. Before disappearing in 2011, Nakamoto mined approximately 1 million BTC. Bitcoin Total Supply Is Limited The United States government is also one of the largest holders of Bitcoin, and they control the keys to these coins. On-chain trackers show that they hold 205,000 BTC, though they have been selling them regularly. Other large Bitcoin holders include MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm with shares listed on the NASDAQ, and Tesla, the electric car maker.

The firm also unveiled on Tuesday its new State of Crypto Index, an interactive tool that tracks on a monthly basis 14 technology-focused metrics that offer a health snapshot of sorts for the industry.  “Our 2023 report aims to address the imbalance between the noise of fleeting price movements – and the data that tracks the signals that matter, including the durable progress of Web3 technology. Overall, the report reflects a healthier industry than market prices may indicate, and a steady cycle of development, product launches, and ongoing innovation,” wrote a16z’s Daren Matsuoka, Eddy Lazzarin, Robert Hackett and Stephanie Zinn in a blog post.  The report says that the headline-grabbing scandals and collapses of the past year have demonstrated the failure of centralized systems versus the open, resilient nature of decentralized infrastructure. A16z notes that Web3 is “more than a financial movement, it’s an evolution of the internet” and it advances the internet through “crypto computers, not crypto casinos.”  Web3 strength  A16z notes the advantages of Web3 over prior technological models include decentralized blockchain networks, the community-governed nature, the lack of power consolidation among corporations and value occurring to network participants.  Web3 adoption is still in its early stages, and decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) metrics have become more stable after falling from record highs in 2021, according to the report. Gaming has shown particular strength: 700 Web3 games launched last year, and games now generate 23 times more on-chain transactions than DeFi.  Time for builders  Last month in the broader crypto industry, there were more than 15 million active addresses, the highest number the firm has ever tracked and more than twice as much as seen in March 2021.  The price-innovation cycle says that market downturns bring more dedicated developers into the crypto space and then the excitement around those projects eventually begins to drive asset prices higher.  “Product cycles are where new things that lead to consistent and more robust growth over many years are occurring, regardless of financial cycles,” A16z Chief Technology Officer Eddy Lazzarin told CoinDesk during an interview.  A16z highlighted the ongoing improvements in blockchain infrastructure. Key factors include new layer 1 chains that improve scalability and programmability and layer 2 scaling systems, such as optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups.

Xclaim allows for the trading of major bankruptcy creditor claims, including FTX, CoinDesk sister company Genesis and BlockFi. Currently, FTX claims are going for 19 cents on the dollar, up from 13 cents earlier this year, while Genesis is going for 52.5 cents and BlockFi for 18 cents.  “To further enhance liquidity, we intend to use the capital from our recent fundraise to expand our products and service offerings. We are most excited about our innovation of Collateralized Claim Obligations,” founder and CEO Matthew Sedigh, said in a note. “By aggregating diversified pools of thousands of claims under a single umbrella, we will have created commoditized products from bespoke assets. This will dramatically open up the market to many more participants on both sides of the market.”  Xclaim says it has listed more than $1 billion of claims and traded more than $200 million in volume since it started operations in 2018, with 500 registered investors – typically individuals or firms experienced with bankruptcy claims purchasing – on the platform. Single claims as large as $52 million have traded on the exchange, Xclaim says.  Xclaim isn’t the only platform offering bankruptcy claims trading. Recently Three Arrows Capital co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu launched OPNX, which is short for Open Exchange. OPNX has struggled to obtain momentum, however, with CoinGecko reporting that the exchange only has $179,235 in volume.  In an earlier interview with CoinDesk, Xclaim Chief Strategy Officer Andrew Glantz said the majority of interest is from Asia-based sellers of claims.  Glantz said 50% of participants come from Singapore, 15% from China and 23% from Taiwan.

This is the latest in a series of acquisition of distressed assets by the miner, which started in the summer of 2022.  The 45,000 Antminers will add over 6.3 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power to CleanSpark's fleet of 6.7 EH/s, once delivered and installed. The acquisition announcement comes as bitcoin crossed $30,000 for the first time in nearly a year, which could reinvigorate the bitcoin mining space.  The first batch of 25,000 rigs will be ready for delivery in August from Bitmain, and the rest are scheduled for September. They will be installed at a site in Sandersville, Georgia, which CleanSpark acquired from Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI) in September.  CleanSpark aims to have 16 EH/s of computing power by the end of the year. It lowered its 2023 guidance in December 2022 from 22.4 EH/s, citing delays in construction by one of its partners, Lancium. Another 2.44 EH/s of machines that it acquired at a discount in February are expected to be online at a Washington state facility later in Q2.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin broke the $30,000 level for the first time since June on Tuesday as March's banking turbulence fades farther into the distance and investors grow more optimistic about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Bitcoin was up 6% in the past 24 hours to $30,100. Trading volume, however, remains low, according to Matteo Bottacini, a trader at Crypto Finance AG. “This indicates that few are taking profits from the year-end low and new buyers are still hesitant to enter the market,” Bottacini wrote in a morning note. Crypto-related stocks also climbed on the back of bitcoin’s rise. Marathon Digital (MARA), Coinbase (COIN) and MicroStrategy (MSTR) all rose on Monday and were up further in premarket trading on Tuesday.  Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss recently lent their Gemini cryptocurrency exchange $100 million to support the business amid the market downturn, Bloomberg reported. The brothers provided the loan after trying to get outside investment for Gemini, Bloomberg said, citing anonymous sources. A Gemini spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment. The $100 million figure stands out in part because that equals the amount Gemini agreed to give some of its customers as part of the Genesis bankruptcy case. Genesis, which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group, froze withdrawals in the aftermath of crypto exchange FTX's collapse last year, a decision that locked up money for customers of Gemini's Earn yield product.  Millions of Aptos Labs' APT tokens will be unlocked on Wednesday in a planned move that’s set to increase the circulating supply by 0.5%, data shows. APT rose nearly 8% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. The Aptos network has a market cap of over $2.3 billion, and the APT unlock is valued at over $50 million based on current prices. Unlocks refer to the automatic release of new tokens belonging to any blockchain network into the open market. They are often previously planned. Aptos is a blockchain that was founded by former employers of Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms (META), after Facebook abandoned its own plans to create a blockchain-based payments network called Diem (formerly Libra).  Chart of the Day  The chart shows changes in bitcoin's 30-day rolling correlation with gold and U.S. equities since June 2021.

In other words, bitcoin's immediate prospects are more closely tied to gold than stocks.

Chainlink Sentiment Has Been Highly Negative Recently As pointed out by an analyst on Twitter, cryptocurrency market participants look to be bullish on LINK right now. The relevant indicator here is the on-chain analytics firm Santiment’s “Weighted Sentiment,” which tells us about the general sentiment around a given coin. This metric is based on two other indicators: the Sentiment Score and the Social Volume. The former measures whether investors are talking negatively or positively about an asset currently. This indicator goes through social media text documents (the likes of tweets, telegram messages, Reddit threads, etc.) and uses a machine learning algorithm to discern the sentiment. The latter metric, the “Social Volume,” simply measures the total number of unique social media text documents that are discussing the asset in question. This indicator helps us know whether the coin is being talked about a lot or not right now. When the Sentiment Score is weighted by this Social Volume, the aforementioned Weighted Sentiment is obtained. This means that this metric only shows spikes whenever the sentiment is leaning towards one side and the Social Volume is also high at the same time. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Chainlink Weighted Sentiment over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been red in recent weeks | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink Weighted Sentiment has been at relatively high negative values during the last few weeks. This means that a large amount of negative discussion is taking place around the asset currently. Most of the market being bearish on LINK, however, may in fact be bullish for the price. The reason behind that is whenever the sentiment goes towards any extreme, the price becomes more probable to go against the view of the majority. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Parallels With 2017 Cycle, Here’s What Can Happen Next A trading philosophy called contrarian investing follows this idea. Contrarian investors generally buy when the market is fearful, while they sell when the holders get greedy. This can also be seen at work in the chart. In February, the Weighted Sentiment hit pretty high positive values, suggesting that holders became highly optimistic about the coin. With this euphoria, however, the price actually topped out and has since declined. Back in December, the indicator had similarly negative values as now. The cryptocurrency hit a low with this sentiment and rebounded with some sharp bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Circulation Rate Remains Low, Why This Could Be Bad For Rally Naturally, this trend doesn’t necessarily have to repeat this time as well. However, given the pessimism in the market, perhaps a contrarian investor would tend to believe a bullish jump may take place in the near future.

42387745,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQrIMB,1681213266,XRP's 4-Week Rally Was Led by Retail Investors: Kaiko,"XRP, a digital coin often used to make international payments, has rallied nearly 40% in the past four weeks, outperforming other top digital assets, including bitcoin (BTC).  The rally was driven mainly by retail investors, while whales – or entities with ample capital supply – added to bearish pressure in the market, according to an analysis by Kaiko, a Paris-based provider of crypto data.  ""Looking at buy and sell transactions on the two largest Korean exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb, market sell orders overwhelmingly outpace market buys for orders over 200k XRP (~$95k),"" Kaiko's analysts wrote in a weekly note published Monday. ""In contrast, the buy/sell ratio was much more balanced for smaller orders.""  The sell-side imbalance in market orders of more than 200,000 XRP tokens suggests that whales have been selling into the price rally and that individuals and nonprofessional investors did the heavy lifting. A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset immediately. Such orders are usually executed at or near the current bid or ask price.  ""When looking at the tick-level trade data, we can observe that whales are taking profit, which suggests the rally is retail-driven,"" Kaiko's analysts added.  Trading volumes in XRP-Korean won trading pairs on South Korean exchanges Upbit, Bithumb and Korbit soared last month, accounting for a giant share of the global activity.  XRP has been rallying on hopes that Ripple Labs, which the U.S. argues issued the token, will win its legal battle against the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC in 2020 claimed the Ripple Network was selling unregistered securities after the platform sold $1.3 billion worth of XRP.  The cryptocurrency changed hands near 52 cents at press time, It hit a high of 58 cents on March 29, CoinDesk data shows. A technical chart shows the 50-day simple moving average crossed above the 200-day SMA last week, confirming what is known as a ""golden cross.""  Chart analysts and traders consider a golden cross as a harbinger of a long-term bullish trend, even though the indicator is based on backward-looking moving averages and tends to lag prices.  The golden cross comes two months after the bitcoin and S&P 500 daily charts flashed a similar bullish signal.

While the largest cryptocurrency by market cap has now broken above $30,000, ETH is still trending below $2,000, a price point that should’ve already been broken given the current recovery trend in the crypto market. So why is Ethereum still trading below $2,000? Market Waiting Out Ethereum Upgrade The Ethereum Shapella upgrade is scheduled to take place on April 12 and anticipation around the upgrade is already building. However, instead of pushing the price of the digital asset up as expected, it seems investors are waiting to see the outcome of the upgrade instead before making a decision. Related Reading: Ethereum Addresses In Profit Touches 11-Month High Ahead Of Shapella Upgrade Usually, Ethereum is hot on the heels of Bitcoin and mirrors most of the moves the pioneer cryptocurrency makes. But this time around, ETH has barely kept up, and even with Bitcoin’s break above $30,000, which should’ve seen ETH beat $2,000, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is still trading below this important level. A good reason for this slow growth is that Shapella would bring about withdrawals from the Ethereum staking contract. With over $34 billion staked, tensions are high regarding how much ETH will be sent back into circulation once withdrawals are opened. Despite the staggered withdrawals, there will still be a good amount of ETH being withdrawn which would go straight into the market, increasing supply in a market already struggling with low demand. Withdrawals of staked ETH have to wait to be processed to mitigate an exodus and worse security for Ethereum. Partial withdrawals would take 4-5 days, while it's projected to take ~100 days for 1/3 of full withdrawals to happen, translating into $80M-$100M of $ETH being… https://t.co/4mV4JDXk3t — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 10, 2023 Fears around this new supply could be behind the price of ETH still trailing behind $2,000. If investors and traders are not convinced that there would be enough demand to mop up the new supply, then money will continue to flow out of ETH, and beating $2,000 becomes even harder. ETH Bulls Remain Strong Despite the uncertainty around the Shapella upgrade and what withdrawals would mean for Ethereum, bulls have still remained firmly in control of the price action. There has been mounting buy pressure at $1,900 which has worked to turn this resistance into support for the digital asset. Related Reading: Bullish Signal? MATIC Becomes Top 3 Most Purchased Coin Among Ethereum Whales The next major resistance for ETH now lies at $1,950 but since bulls have managed to maintain a price above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, the possibility of ETH breaking above this level is quite high. Once this resistance is beaten, then ETH will quickly retake $2,000. ETH continues to trend below $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com However, if it were to lose its footing at $1,900 once more, then support is much lower for the cryptocurrency, sitting just above $1,800.

Policymakers are now focusing on financial services that lack an intermediary, basically software programs that allow individuals to borrow and lend without a bank. Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department called for tougher money-laundering controls, warning that DeFi was being used to raise illicit funds for North Korea.  “The regulation of disintermediated finance cannot simply replicate the systems that currently govern traditional finance,” said a consultation paper by the ACPR, the arm of the French central bank that supervises banks and insurers. The consultation period during which the ACPR asks for opinions on a proposal is open until May 19.  As one option, “players exercising effective control over sensitive services could be required to incorporate, becoming subject to supervision,” added the paper, which also “proposes to strengthen the security of smart contracts using a certification mechanism” covering code security and governance.  New rules should also stop intermediaries from selling highly leveraged products to regular retail investors, the report said, noting that DeFi often allows high-risk products to be used that in regular finance would be restricted to seasoned professionals.  The Legal High Committee for Financial Markets of Paris, a group of regulators and lawyers, is weighing the legal status of the decentralized autonomous organizations and is due to report in the fall. That could follow in the footsteps of the Law Commission of England and Wales, which has said innovative finance could shake up centuries-old property norms.  The ACPR said it wanted to “explicitly” extend planned European Union consumer protection rules to cover DeFi. Next week lawmakers in the EU are due to vote on the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, or MiCA, which will regulate centralized crypto platforms like exchanges and digital-wallet providers.

Additionally, the developers plan to introduce a way to earn and ensure players have a personal space where they can build and manage their projects.  In the metaverse, users can create their own avatars – fashioned as humanoid dogs – to explore, visit and interact with lands and contribute to the in-game economy.

11643778,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526363,1681206327,How To Trade Bitcoin Ahead Of Tomorrow’s CPI Release? Analysts Weigh In,"The Bitcoin price has risen above $30,000 for the first time since June 2022, continuing the uptrend that began earlier this year. After the price last struggled with resistance at $28,600 on the 1-day chart for over three weeks, the explosive breakout occurred yesterday while both traditional markets and gold remained flat. However, as Bitcoinist reported in this week’s macro preview, tomorrow will be the most important day of the week, if not the month – and could set the tone for the next few weeks. Wednesday, April 12, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March will be released at 8:30 am EST. A few hours later, at 2:00 pm EST, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes will become public. The minutes could reveal more details about the Fed’s projections and considerations for its latest interest rate decision in March. Both events are likely to cause heightened volatility and could be trend-setting for the Bitcoin price. How To Trade Bitcoin Ahead Of CPI? Analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) stated in a series of tweets that pre-release is probably a good time to think about de-risking. Still, he believes that the “true resistance is somewhere around $34k.” He reasons that traders are likely to pause on risk before the event. In general, the CPI release creates the risk that a hot print could force a market-wide revaluation. In addition, new information or wording from the FOMC minutes could influence the market heavily. “Overall an environment that is conducive to buying the dip, but don’t get caught over extended into the highs,” warns Ted, who also published an analysis on the Cleveland Fed’s prediction for tomorrow’s CPI inflation numbers.

In February, the figure was +5.99% for the headline number. For core inflation, the prediction is for +5.66% YoY (previously +5.53%). In general, Ted notes: Headline projected to come down significantly versus prior, but core to remain elevated (Fed prefers core). Elevated core inflation will likely translate to speculation on another 25 bps hike in May. According to the analyst, chances are good that actual CPI numbers will at least meet the Cleveland Fed’s expectations. Since April 2022, actual data have been at or below the Cleveland Fed’s prediction 73% of the time. In addition, since September 2022, the Cleveland Fed has overestimated the core inflation index 100% of the time. “On this event forcing higher prices for risk assets; I’d think that the market wants to see core print lower than consensus and ideally, lower than the previous month (+5.53%),” Ted concludes. Related Reading: Brace Yourself: The Most Explosive Move In Bitcoin In Years Has Begun However, there are also warning signs that tomorrow’s CPI print could be hotter than expected. Risk assets like Bitcoin could be hit the hardest. Holger Zschaepitz, author and economic journalist, wrote via Twitter today: Hedge Funds boost S&P shorts to decade high before CPI, earnings. Net short positions at levels not seen since 2011. Goldman’s clients cut tech longs at fastest pace in 15 months.

42412374,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4lKc,1681204729,"Bitcoin, Not Ether, Builds Crypto Market Dominance Ahead of Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade","Ethereum's highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade, also called the Shanghai-Capella hard fork, is set to occur Wednesday, after which users will have access to the $31 billion worth of ether (ETH) staked in the blockchain since December 2020.  The upgrade has been widely hailed as long-term bullish for Ethereum's native token. Still, bitcoin (BTC), not ether, is outperforming the broader crypto market and becoming more dominant as the upgrade approaches.  Bitcoin's dominance rate, which measures the largest cryptocurrency's share of crypto's total market valuation, rose to 48.5% early Tuesday, the highest since July 2021, according to data tracked by charting platform TradingView. The metric has risen by 15% this year.  Ether's dominance rate remains stagnant between 19% and 20%. That compares with a rise to 21% from 14% in the weeks before a software upgrade last September known as the Merge. That technological overhaul replaced Ethereum's at-the-time energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism of verifying transactions with a proof-of-stake system and set the stage for Shanghai. Staking involves depositing coins in the blockchain to boost the network's security and verify transactions in return for rewards.  Investor caution in pricing ether ahead of Shanghai stems from several factors, including concerns tokens unlocked after the upgrade will flood the market and regulatory issues.  ""The Shanghai upgrade will unlock over 18 million ether staked since late 2020. The market is worried that the unlocking may bring about a sell-off, causing uncertainty in the market,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk.  While the upgrade will unlock more than 18 million ETH, only partial withdrawals of 1.1 million ETH – the coins earned as staking rewards – will be withdrawable immediately.  Analysts have recently said that the partial withdrawals will take several days to process and the resulting selling pressure is unlikely to be significant.  ""If all partial withdrawals are attempted just after the Shapella fork (which seems highly improbable), it would take around four and a half days for these ETH profits to enter the market,"" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a note published Friday.  According to Outumuro, full withdrawals representing most of the ETH staked will take longer.  ""It would take approximately 100 days for one-third of validators to exit if they all attempt to exit simultaneously, translating into $80-$100M worth of ETH being withdrawn per day. This would make up about 1% of ETH’s daily trading volume, though it is unlikely that all withdrawals will be sold,"" Outumuro noted.  The market, however, isn't convinced, as evident from ether's underperformance relative to bitcoin and ether put options, or bearish bets, drawing higher prices than call options.  Regulatory concerns are probably also weighing on investors. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ethereum staking services offered by centralized exchanges amount to selling unregistered securities in the U.S.  ""ETH faces relatively higher regulatory risks. The SEC has repeatedly stated that ETH is a security rather than a commodity, which differs from the CFTC's opinion and means additional risk, so investors understandably prefer BTC,"" Ardern said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. agency that regulates the futures market.  Lastly, recent banking sector instability in the U.S. and the resulting sharp repricing of interest-rate expectations lower worldwide has benefited bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has evolved as a macro asset in the past three years and has a history of drawing safe-haven bids during banking crises.  ""BTC got the store-of-value narrative back after multiple U.S. banks failed in mid-March. Since then, BTC's dominance rate has been rising,"" Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Ritika Malik said. Dominance rate is now at a ""multiyear resistance"" that has capped the upside in the past, meaning ether and other coins could soon outshine bitcoin, Malik said.  ""By being concerned, the market is actually 'pricing in' already any selling pressure that we are likely to get from the Shanghai hard fork and the upgrade could actually become a 'buy-the-news' event,"" she added. ""BTC dominance chart is at a multiyear resistance as well as we speak. All the stars are aligning for a rotation into ETH.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/11/bitcoin-not-ether-is-becoming-more-dominant-in-crypto-market-ahead-of-ethereums-shanghai-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21695d7db1331b45bb4fb0305ceb93db0b7b13dc-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, Huobi, one of Binance’s rivals, announced that it has been experiencing a healthy demand for futures trading. #Huobi Top Trader Long Positions: 🔹 $HT 71% 🔹 $DOT 70% 🔹 #Bitcoin 64% 🔹 $ARB 62% 🔹 $ETH 55% What’s your next long? — Huobi Futures (@HuobiFutures_) April 10, 2023 DOT placed second in Huobi’s top trader ranking, surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of futures demand. The ranking is determined by the ratio of executed longs to shorts for each asset. Despite experiencing a minor setback in the past seven days, Polkadot’s price remains strong at $6.45 according to Coingecko. Moreover, the cryptocurrency’s recent 24-hour rally of 4.4% suggests that it will continue to be a significant player in the crypto market. Source: Coingecko With its impressive performance and growing demand in the futures market, Polkadot could be a cryptocurrency to watch in the coming weeks. Bullish Signals Despite Minor Setback DOT faced resistance at the $6.45 mark but found support at $6.10, which provided a much-needed boost to its bullish momentum. In analyzing the derivatives market, it becomes clear that Polkadot’s long positions are outweighing shorts, indicating that there may be further bullish demand on the horizon. In addition, the sell wall could hint at a possible bullish pivot as demand slowly but steadily overcomes selling pressure. DOT total market cap now at $7.5 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Pulls Ahead Of Top 50 Altcoins With 10% Price Spike With enough volume, Polkadot investors could expect a minimum of a 6% upside this week. Given its current ranking in the derivatives market, it is possible that bullish demand could continue to grow as the week progresses. Despite a slight decrease in value over the past week, it is also worth noting that Polkadot has maintained a healthy level of development activity since mid-March, outperforming other leading blockchains in this aspect. This impressive track record speaks to the network’s ongoing progress and potential for further expansion. -Featured image from Forkast News",POSITIVE,DOT,BTC | DOT | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/polkadot-popular-among-futures-traders/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

11642144,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526371,1681201899,"Bugs Discovered On Ordinals Protocol As Bitcoin Rips Above $30,000","Bitcoin prices are now trading above $30,000 for the first time in over eight months. The rally coincides with the discovery of an indexing bug in Ordinals protocol, a platform where users can mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin. The 1,200 Orphaned Inscriptions On Ordinals Protocol The bug in the Ordinals protocol was discovered to have led to approximately 1,200 inscriptions that were supposed to be included in Bitcoin being excluded though they were all valid. These “orphaned” inscriptions were because the indexing flaw only caused the protocol to pick out inscriptions in the first transaction input. Compared to smart contracting platforms, especially Ethereum, which is dominant, NFT enthusiasts say storing files on Bitcoin is relatively cheaper. Ordinals protocol was launched after the activation of the Taproot upgrade on Bitcoin. Ordinals allow users to activate a smart contract code on transactions enabling them to embed an inscription on each Satoshi. Related Reading: Bitcoin NFT Ordinals Boosts Taproot Adoption By 1,000% In Q1 2023 Users can freely create inscriptions on the Ordinals protocol and input them on each Satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Since each “inscription” is unique, they can act as NFTs. Unlike in Ethereum, where files are stored in a server and where block space demand is also high, creating inscriptions on Bitcoin save resources. Ordinal protocol proponents also say this option offers efficient storage means with better authenticity. However, users who use them won’t benefit from creator royalties like they would have done in Ethereum and other alternatives. Ordinarily, the option for creator royalties on NFTs minted on Ethereum offers artists a way of generating passive income on subsequent sales. With the bug now revealed, the Ordinals protocol community has forwarded two proposals to address the issue of orphaned inscriptions and the resulting numbering error. A bug was found in the ordinals protocol that caused ~1,200 inscriptions that should have been valid to not get included. The first of these ""orphan"" inscriptions happened just before inscription number 420,285. The bug was caused by the ordinals protocol only counting… — Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) April 10, 2023 One option is proactively changing inscription numbers by picking “a block height to upgrade the ordinals protocol that will retroactively index/include the approximately 1,200 orphan inscriptions.” The second option is not to change the inscription numbers. Instead, developers will pick a block height to upgrade the ordinals protocol while changing the indexing rules. In this rule change, the protocol will automatically assign an inscription number to those not included in the first input of a transaction. Should this be done, the orphaned inscriptions will be viewed as “misprints.” Related Reading: NFT Industry Hit Hard In March With 31% Decline In Revenue – Here’s Why Bitcoin Rallying As the Ordinals protocol discusses the way forward, Bitcoin prices are looking better.

The unlock is expected to occur at 05:30 UTC.  APT rose nearly 8% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, outperforming bitcoin (BTC) and the broader market. The Aptos network has a market cap of over $2.3 billion.  The APT unlock is valued at over $50 million based on current prices. Unlocks refer to the automatic release of new tokens belonging to any blockchain network into the open market. They are usually planned beforehand.  Some 84% of all APT tokens are still locked, meaning the token's price is likely to drop long term because most of the tokens wouldn't have hit the market.  Token unlocks have the power to sway investors and traders. The addition of tokens to the market allows early investors, developers or other holders to sell their assets while the price is still high – which contributes to the selling pressure.  Based on fundamental demand, however, newer investors or traders may increase their existing holdings of that token, leading to a price rise after the initial selling pressure wears off.  Aptos Labs, the parent company of the Aptos blockchain, raised over $350 million over multiple funding rounds last year, as CoinDesk previously reported. The firm was founded by former employers of Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms (META), after Facebook abandoned its own plans to create a blockchain-based payments network called Diem (formerly Libra).",NEUTRAL,APT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | APT,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/11/aptos-bumps-ahead-of-50m-token-unlock-which-may-add-selling-pressure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f86ab2f96746bc4a978fc2e229b5296c12f723b-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412373,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4lIk,1681193847,Bitcoin Shorts Take on 87% of Futures Liquidations as BTC Crosses $30K,"Strength in bitcoin (BTC) pushed the asset over the crucial $30,000 level for the first time since June 2022, causing heavy losses to traders betting on a decline.  Over 87% of all future trades that were liquidated in the past 24 hours were short, or bets against a rise in prices. Losses from these trades amounted to some $145 million in the process. Crypto exchange Huobi had over $45 million in liquidations on its platform, followed by counterparts Binance and OKX at $35 million each.  The largest single liquidation order happened on Huobi, a bitcoin/tether trade valued at $11 million.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Recent strength in bitcoin can likely be attributed to worsening economic conditions which may lead to the adoption of a decentralized asset among investors, some opine.  “Bitcoin has effectively decoupled from the traditional markets since the start of the year, up over 80% while stocks have slumped,” said Alex Adelman, CEO of bitcoin rewards app Lolli, in an email to CoinDesk. “Bitcoin’s strength compared to the traditional markets shows that investors are increasingly shifting their capital into bitcoin, choosing it instead of traditional investments to build their wealth.”  “The fact that today’s rally did not have a clear catalyst is a bellwether of bitcoin’s newly bullish market conditions and strong investor confidence. Bitcoin’s ongoing strength suggests that bitcoin is emerging from the so-called ‘crypto winter’ into a new phase of strength and renewed interest from retail and institutional investors,” Adelman added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/11/bitcoin-shorts-take-on-87-of-futures-liquidations-as-btc-crosses-30k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72ae280e7f877c015503d0e65549a58cf333d430-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Given that social media in China is tightly controlled, bitcoin prices showing up on Douyin seemed to be an indication that Beijing may be warming up to crypto. However, the ticker being taken down immediately afterwards suggests otherwise. Douyin is the most downloaded short video-sharing platform in China, with 700 million daily active users.  The adding of the bitcoin price ticker seemed to coincide with Hong Kong opening its door to crypto and China’s state-owned banks reportedly soliciting business from crypto firms, even though opening an account with one remains a challenge.  ""Cryptocurrency platforms are part of the whole Web3 ecosystem and we are very supportive of the development of the whole Internet ecosystem,"" Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) Chief Executive Officer Leung Fung-yee said recently during the question-and-answer session at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2023. “These virtual currency platforms must protect the safety of all investors from the perspective of investor protection.”  Paul Chan, Hong Kong’s financial secretary also shared this supportive sentiment in a recent blog post.  “In order for Web3 to steadily take the road of innovative development, we will adopt a strategy that emphasizes both ‘proper regulation’ and ‘promoting development,’” he wrote. “In terms of proper supervision, in addition to ensuring financial security and preventing systemic risks, we will also do a good job in investor education and protection, and anti-money laundering.”  This week the city is hosting the Hong Kong Web3 Festival which expects more than 10,000 attendees and 300 speakers.

This indicates a strong interest in the token and its potential for growth. However, there was also an increase in bearish sentiment towards STX during the same period, with a growing number of posts expressing cynicism about the token’s future prospects.

42412364,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4l9O,1681184350,First Mover Asia: Arthur Hayes Sees a 'Balkanization of Finance' Coming Soon as Crypto Rallies,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether are well within the green as they near highs not seen since the COVID-19-induced bull market.  Insights: For former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes, traditional banking is broken and finance will never be the same.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,279 +57.8 ▲ 4.7% Bitcoin (BTC) $30,294 +1978.5 ▲ 7.0% Ethereum (ETH) $1,931 +76.4 ▲ 4.1% S&P 500  4,109.11 +4.1 ▲ 0.1% Gold  $2,011 +21.9 ▲ 1.1% Nikkei 225  27,633.66 +115.3 ▲ 0.4% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,279 +57.8 ▲ 4.7% Bitcoin (BTC) $30,294 +1978.5 ▲ 7.0% Ethereum (ETH) $1,931 +76.4 ▲ 4.1% S&P 500 4,109.11 +4.1 ▲ 0.1% Gold $2,011 +21.9 ▲ 1.1% Nikkei 225 27,633.66 +115.3 ▲ 0.4% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin and ether are well within the green as the Asia business day begins, with bitcoin pushing past a yearly high of $30,000, and ether beginning to test $2,000.  Crypto-related stocks are also at year-long highs as the price of bitcoin surges.  While bitcoin's relationship to the current banking crisis has made it a clear winner over the last month, there are plenty of questions as to how the Ethereum network's Shanghai upgrade is going to impact the price of ether.  Is it what ether needs to surge ahead? Or, is ether just following bitcoin's gains?  Ether Capital CEO Brian Mosoff calls it a ""non-event.""  “My suspicion is that this is going to be a non-event in terms of price,” Mosoff told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Monday. “I expect you will see more ETH get locked into staking, either from solo stakers or, again, you’ll see more structured products come to market.”  There's also the fact that most of the staked ether is also being held at a loss, as CryptoQuant recently wrote in a report.  Meanwhile, the futures market is pricing in modest gains for ether on contracts that expire at the end of June.  New inflation data is scheduled to be released on April 12, which should show whether the Federal Reserve has tamed the beast, and that's always been bullish for crypto and risk assets.  Although some have said that there's a new safe-haven narrative forming around crypto, the data still shows a tight correlation between it and the S&P 500.  ""We are likely to see continued accumulation from longer-term investors interested in its currency debasement hedge properties, while short-term moves are dictated by shifting theories about what monetary liquidity will do,"" Noelle Acheson, the author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, recently wrote.  Insights  Arthur Hayes Isn't Mincing Words About Banking  During the coldest days of 2022’s crypto winter, when the wreckage of the FTX exchange was still smoldering, VanEck forecast that bitcoin could drop to $10K-$12K by the first quarter of 2023.  ""Bitcoin will test $10,000-$12,000 in Q1 amid a wave of miner bankruptcies, which will mark the low point of the crypto winter,"" Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, wrote at the time.  In many ways VanEck was right about the pressure bitcoin has been under: Some miners have gone bankrupt, others are engaged in litigation with each other and mining-friendly Texas has passed legislation limiting the benefits available to the industry.  But VanEck was wrong about something major: the price of bitcoin.  2023 has been defined by being a mini-bull market. Year to date, bitcoin is up about 80%, currently just over $30K.  And that’s all in the face of the crypto-friendly banks Silvergate and Signature collapse.  ""It's all driven by the collapsing of the Western banking system,"" Arthur Hayes said in a recent interview with CoinDesk. “The world is recognizing the entire Western banking system is bankrupt, and they’re all f—ed.”  Bitcoin's correlation with traditional assets is breaking as it serves as an asset outside the traditional fiat banking system, Hayes says, pointing to the S&P 500’s 7% gain year to date, versus bitcoin’s more than 80% increase.  And what does the Hayes portfolio look like as the Western banking system teeters?  Bitcoin, gold, property and maybe even some assets in RMB.  “I’m going to go into all these other things that are not connected to the banking system directly,” he said. “I want to own assets in Dubai and all these other regions that actually have a real economy other than just printing money.”  Hayes isn’t a total dollar doomer – his prediction is that it's still going to be in use with the U.S. and her allies, but it will no longer be the world’s reserve currency. The next decade will see the balkanization of currencies, with the dollar making up 40%-50% of trade (between 1999-2019 it accounted for 74% of Asia-Pacific trade, and 96% of trade in the Americas).  “The West will be a dollar block, and other non-aligned countries will use gold, Dirhams, CNY, rubles, whatever,” he said. “When you go to different places you’ll need to use a different currency, and everyone becomes an FX speculator more than they are today.”  What about the price of bitcoin?  In March, Balaji Srinivasan bet that bitcoin would be $1 million by June 17 on the back of hyperinflation and a failing banking system. On Twitter, he continues to double down on the prediction, although prediction markets are giving it a 99% chance of not happening.  Hayes doesn’t discount the possibility of bitcoin hitting $1 million, and has been a vocal supporter of Srinivasan on Twitter. But it might not happen for a while.  “I know it’s coming, and I think bitcoin just keeps climbing. Will it reach $70,000 this year? I doubt it,” he said. “In 2024 there will be the halving, and more banks that have gone bankrupt in the U.S. and Europe. You’ll probably also have a very explicit guarantee of all deposits in the Western world by central banks.”  At this point, Hayes argues, the market will know it needs to be in bitcoin, gold, ether, or other assets.  “Anything that isn’t stocks and government bonds,” he says.

42412359,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4l4i,1681178041,Bitcoin Breaks Above $30K for First Time Since June 2022,"Bitcoin (BTC) moved past $30,000 for the first time since June 10, 2022, as March's banking turbulence faded into the distance and investors grew more optimistic about U.S. central bank monetary policy.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $30,237, up 6.75% over the last 24 hours.  “It’s clear that the market is pricing a slowdown in growth, and in turn a loosening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve over the course of 2023,"" said Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa, a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider for crypto. ""For evidence of this, just look at the bond market.""  A check of the bond market shows the U.S. two-year Treasury note having fallen to below 4% from a peak above 5% in early March as traders rapidly reversed their expectations of future Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.  ""There will likely still be a lot of liquidity injected into the market as a result,"" added Mico. ""Already, bitcoin has been the best-performing asset of 2023, and it usually is the asset that responds most quickly and violently to these kinds of monetary shifts.""  Bitcoin last topped $30,000 on June 10 as it was on its way down to below $20,000, where it spent large parts of late 2022 and into the first weeks of 2023. It has been hovering around $28,000 for the past three weeks as wary investors gauged the impact of a near banking meltdown, continued inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic uncertainties. Bitcoin is up about 80% year to date after starting the year at about $16,600.  The crypto surged in January on signs that inflation was waning. Bitcoin stalled in February but then regained momentum in late March following the failure of Silicon Valley and Signature banks when some investors questioned the stability of the current monetary system and regained their appetite for assets that hold their value. Gold also recently spiked, topping $2,000 for the first time since 2020.  Mico noted that there is certainly a narrative shift happening because of the banking crisis feeding into bitcoin’s momentum. Increasingly, ""BTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,"" he added. ""BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.""  ""De-dollarization is also increasingly becoming part of the narrative, which is further accelerating BTC adoption,"" Mico concluded. ""With BTC, in short, you are your own bank. It’s difficult to make predictions given the volatility of late, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this momentum regarding BTC continues.""  In an email to CoinDesk, Bob Ras, co-founder of Sologenic, a blockchain-powered network for tokenizing securities, noted that bitcoin had decoupled from stocks and shown ""its increasing appeal as a safe haven for investors.""  ""While the 2020-2021 period was perceived as Bitcoin's breakthrough moment, the present time truly marks its ascendance onto the global stage as a formidable asset,"" Ras wrote.

11632078,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=524920,1681174439,Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $30K For First Time Since June 2022,"Bitcoin price is once again pushing higher and breaking boundaries, this time above the key psychological level of $30K per coin. It marks the first time BTCUSD trading above the level since June 2022. Is this more confirmation of a bullish trend blossoming? Or is this a fake out above resistance before a bigger collapse and possible recession? Bitcoin Price Moves Back Above $30K Psychological Resistance Back in mid-2021 after Bitcoin price was rejected from $65K, it first found support at $30K and bounced back to $68K to put in a second, slightly higher high and long term peak. After the second rejection, BTCUSD fell into a bear market and ultimately lost $30K, making it the most important line in the sand for bulls to reclaim since below $20K.

The onus is now on bulls to hold the resistance level and flip it back to support. Bitcoin price has breached back above $30K | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Why The Resistance Break Matters For Bullish Continuation BTCUSD is currently trading above $30K for the first time since June 2022, when the entire crypto market crashed due to post-LUNA collapse contagion. The fallout and resulting domino effect led to widespread problems in the crypto industry. Historically, once Bitcoin price reclaims former support turned resistance, a new bull run begins. There is a technical reason for this, however. Related Reading: This Bullish Bitcoin Technical Signal Suggests The Bottom Is In According to Elliott Wave Principle, corrections form in three waves against the primary trend labeled as ABC. The A-wave finds local support and attempts another high. Depending on if the pattern is a zig-zag, or flat, the B-wave either forms a higher or lower high. After the B-wave back in the primary trend direction completes, the C-wave reverses course and cuts right through the former support where an abundance of stop losses and positions are located, resulting in a violent move down. Sound familiar? In the past, each time Bitcoin price reclaimed the key level where the A-wave ended, the bear market bottom was officially in, and a new bull market formed. Is that what’s ahead now that BTC has retaken $30K? From a technical perspective, reclaiming the A-wave support is the first step in establishing a new bullish trend in #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/6q6thjS5iI — Tony ""The Bull"" (@tonythebullBTC) March 29, 2023 Follow @TonyTheBullBTC on Twitter or join the TonyTradesBTC Telegram for exclusive daily market insights and technical analysis education.
