42376497,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AkIj,1369180254,Mycelium promises Bitcoin card with a brain,"A group of Austrian developers recently demonstrated a mobile Bitcoin payment network that will serve as a precursor to a credit-card-sized, hardware-based bitcoin wallet.  Shown at last weekend's Bitcoin 2013 conference, the mobile payment network -- called Mycelium -- is an attempt to make bitcoin transactions less technically challenging, and to enable them to happen (at least, for a little bit) without an internet connect . That might seem counterintuitive for a technology whose protocol relies on peer-to-peer communications, but CTO Alexander Vasylchenko has a plan.  ""It makes bitcoins local,"" Vasylchenko says. ""It promotes local economies. It brings Bitcoin to the community. The real potential is when the average person uses it seamlessly, without any of the laptops or wallets or exchanges that we have to deal with at the moment.""  Mycelium’s endgame involves a credit-card-sized device called Bitcoin Card that carries bitcoins. The card will include a small radio transmitter that can be used to connect with other cards within 50 meters. Bitcoins can then be exchanged between cards, even when no internet connection is present.  The cards will still need to connect to the broader Bitcoin network to reconcile a transaction. Mycelium is designing a gateway in the form of a USB dongle, which will connect with local cards up to 200 meters away, reconciling their Bitcoin transactions via the Mycelium network.  The idea is to make Bitcoin easier for non-technical people to use, and without a smartphone. All merchants will have an account with the Mycelium network, and will operate a gateway, making it easy for them to take payments at the point of sale. But if two people wish to exchange bitcoins without a network connection, the card-to-card transaction will take over. Transactions of this kind will be possible only using bitcoins that have already been confirmed by the back-end network at the last point of synchronization.  [post-quote]  Vasylchenko isn't revealing much about how the Mycelium network will operate at the back end, but he is pretty candid about the cards. The project first began in 2007, before Bitcoin was introduced, and was much more ambitious. The card was intended to support transactions in community currencies. It was supposed to have an e-paper screen, and a meshed radio communications system that would interact with other cards in the area. It was to include SMS text capabilities, and would be solar powered.  Then, things changed. Bitcoin came out, and the developers decided to focus on that protocol. The Mycelium network was vocal for a while, but then went quiet. During a long period of awkward silence over the past year, the team realized that a solar-powered card wouldn't work very well when it was being carried around in someone's pocket. Solving the miniaturization and power challenges proved more complex than first imagined.  But now Mycelium has the result: a non-solar-powered card, with a non-rechargeable primary battery, designed to be used for a year. The screen on the new design has been replaced with an LCD, on the reasoning that it will be turned on only for transactions.  The firm’s optimistic estimate is that the cards will ship early next year. It doesn't have a firm price, but it knows that -- in addition to selling the cards directly to users -- it will also allow merchants to distribute them, possibly with branding opportunities. ""The same cards can be used as loyalty discount cards,"" Vasylchenko says.  Who is funding all this? The money comes from private equity, claim the founders, adding that there is also a ""wholesale partner"". Since 2008, the firm has received $30 million in funding. It is certainly an expensive exercise. The device is the same size and more or less the same thickness as a conventional credit card, and it has a custom-designed and fabricated CPU.  “This card is (a) state-of-the-art card and there is nothing so complex,” says Vasylchenko, who says he's essentially fitting a 1990-class mobile phone into a credit card. “It’s a huge international multilateral project.”  But first, the team is getting the Mycelium network up and running. That won't be commercially operational for another four to six months. Before that, they'll be releasing a smartphone-based Mycelium digital bitcoin wallet, which was expected to be available on the Android app store this month.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/21/mycelium-promises-bitcoin-card-with-a-brain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c00a3f8bdf44bbaf9ad272fb73c833f59df0fa3b-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376493,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AkDh,1369149818,Bitcoin community adapts to hackers and fraudsters,"The Bitcoin community has adapted to verbal, criminal and cyber attacks on the currency, an academic paper due for release tomorrow, reveals.  The attacks - whether from hackers, fraudsters or government regulators - seem to be strengthening the community, the research Breaking Out of the Bank in Europe - Exploring Collective Emergent Institutional Entrepreneurship Through Bitcoin suggests.  The rise in discussion of attacks in the last two years, as well as the increasing number of start-ups like Bitpay, Coinbase and Coinsetter, have collectively increased awareness and improved technologies that prevent fraud. In other words, the community has acted to defend itself, the paper says.  The paper says:    ""[I]t seems that these threats have mobilized the community to self organize and bring the community together around a common purpose...      When the community is challenged and still absorbs the shock, the community appears to be strengthened rather than damaged. Therefore, we propose that these instances of fraud, by bonding the community and by flourishing safe businesses around Bitcoin, actually increase Bitcoin’s institutional entrepreneurship potential.""    Researchers studied online Bitcoin activity from Facebook, LinkedIn and other sites. They also examined 1.15m posts on Bitcointalk forums written by almost 22,000 people.  The research suggests there is evidence of the open-source Bitcoin community increasingly acting as an ""institutional entrepreneur"". It also says that Bitcoin is having an impact on the behaviour of traditional banks. The paper says: ""[T]here are indications that the scheme is initiating and implementing substantial changes in the financial institutions that are deeply entrenched globally.""  Researchers warned that the paper was very much a 'work-in-progress', but it still provides a rare look at how the community is changing. They said they hope to conduct more fine-grained analysis of forum posts as well as look at what motivates individuals who are using Bitcoins.  The paper noted changes in forum conversations away from practical, and technical, advice on mining or using wallets to increasing discussion of new services and businesses.  The research also found that five of the top-ten most active forum posters on Bitcointalk were active entrepreneurs, such as Phinnaeus Gage who runs Bitcoin 100. The other five were all anonymous. Researchers could only identify one of them from information available on the site or elsewhere. That individual works on hardware applications for improving mining performance, the other four could not be identified.  The Swedish researchers noted the community keeps careful track of any theft or scam of Bitcoins worth more than 1,000 coins. They found 25 separate such incidents of fraud and theft and looked in detail at Bitcoinica - a Singapore exchange which went offline in 2012 after apparent hacking attacks.  The paper was written by Robin Teigland and Zeynep Yetis, from the Stockholm School of Economics and Tomas Olov Larsson from Karios Future. It will be presented to the 15th Annual Swedish Network for European Studies in Economics and Business conference in Molle tomorrow.  You can download the whole paper from this page.

Professor of Practice at Warwick Business School Jon Rushman said Bitcoin could have a permanent role amongst world currencies but only if it wins over regulators.  Rushman told HedgeWeek:  “Bitcoin needs to work harder on explaining its philosophy and on regulation, they need to do a bit of a charm offensive with the regulators and make them comfortable with it while being true to their principles.”  The prof, a former MD at BlackRock, said it was possible to imagine Bitcoin, or something similar, having a place in the future.  Channelling John Lennon, Rushman said: ""Imagine a world where foreign exchange doesn't exist, monetary policy doesn't exist, and there is no inflation. Society would be free to use all the talent currently directed to these issues elsewhere."" He said governments would continue to raise taxes and borrow, but without ""uncertainty as to the unit of account."".  Rushman said that although Bitcoin was tainted with criminal associations: ""it is hard to find evidence that it is used any more than any other currency."".

42376501,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AkLF,1369133761,"Already bigger than some currencies, Bitcoin can get bigger, Gavin Andresen says","CoinDesk sat down with Gavin Andresen, chief scientist for the Bitcoin Foundation and lead developer for the Bitcoin open source project, to talk about the current state and future of the cryptocurrency he helped bring to the world.  Satoshi  always signed his emails with his PGP key. I wrote back to the person saying, ""Why didn't you sign your emails like you used to?"" and they went away.  CoinDesk: Have you heard from Satoshi lately? Do you think he, she or they are here at Bitcoin 2013?  Andresen: Not since 2011. I do wonder that. It would be interesting if Satoshi is here. I would have no way of knowing, of course. I would like to shake his or her or their hands. I'm guessing that he's moved on. He's working on some other big idea.  CoinDesk: Do you have a personal financial stake in Bitcoin, and if so how much?  Andresen: I tell people, I don't have a huge stake in Bitcoin, but my salary is paid in bitcoin and I bought a few thousand bitcoins back when they were inexpensive so ... there are lots of people who have more bitcoins than me.  CoinDesk: Do you have investments in any of the Bitcoin startups?  Andresen: No. My financial life is actually pretty conservative. Despite holding some bitcoin, most of my investments are in boring mutual funds. And my advice to people is always ... don't invest your life savings in bitcoin unless you're wiling to lose your life savings, because it is highly volatile and risky.  CoinDesk: Past attempts to create digital currencies, like Beanz and Flooz, failed. Why should Bitcoin be different?  Andresen: The previous attempts at e-money or virtual currencies had some central point of failure. So if the company issuing the currency went out of business, the currency would be worthless. It turned out that the companies issuing the currencies did all go out of business. Smart people could see that potential and that prevented them from being successful. There was this single point of failure.  Bitcoin was the first system that got around that single point of failure.  There's no central organization that will go out of business. Bitcoin is supported by everybody who's using it. So unless everybody using Bitcoin decides to stop for some reason, Bitcoin will continue. There's no way to shut it down.  CoinDesk: Couldn't world governments force them to stop?  Andresen: It's possible that every single government in the world decides to make it illegal to transact in Bitcoin ... If Bitcoin could only be used illegally, there would be a much smaller market for Bitcoin. I don't think even then it would completely go away. You might see criminals using it. But I have trouble imagining that every single government in the world will decide to try to make it illegal. It doesn't seem likely to me. I can imagine some governments deciding they don't like Bitcoin and trying to make it illegal, but i can (also) imagine some governments saying they really like Bitcoin.  CoinDesk: What do you think of the fact that CCTV in China recently ran a documentary about Bitcoin? That seems to imply government approval.  Andresen: I'm not expert on global politics, so I can only guess what governments might be thinking. But if I was the government of China and saw the dollar was the dominant world reserve currency, maybe something like Bitcoin wouldn't really scare me.  CoinDesk: How likely is it that Bitcoin really takes off?  Andresen: There's a small chance that Bitcoin will get really, really big. When I say a small chance, maybe there's a one-in-20 chance that Bitcoin will replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency in 50 years. I think there's a much better chance that Bitcoin will be a widely used currency, not rivaling the euro or the dollar, but respectable in the list of worldwide currencies.  Last year, I gave a talk, and one of my talking points was going to be that Bitcoin is smaller than any world national currency. I decided to fact-check myself and I (found) that Bitcoin was actually larger than some national currencies ... We've been moving up the list, if you look at the total value of all the bitcoins in circulation versus the total value of other currencies, we're up to 20 or 40 national currencies that are smaller than Bitcoin. As Bitcoin gets bigger and we move up that list, we're on the path to Bitcoin being a serious world currency.  CoinDesk: What would success for Bitcoin look like in your view?  Andresen: The goal for Bitcoin is being a stable, commonly used currency like any other currency you find in the world.  CoinDesk: Bitcoin has the reputation of being mainly for buying drugs and guns. Is that really a major portion of the transactions?  Andresen: The first markets for Bitcoin were black markets, gray markets, where there was no other choice -- that was the only currency that would work. One of the big early markets for Bitcoin is online gambling. A lot of poker sites operate where online gambling is perfectly legal, but they can't get US customers because there's no way for US customers to transfer money, because the US government has told the credit-card companies that they may not transfer money to these companies. Bitcoin is the only solution for them if they want a worldwide audience, so those were early adopters.  The benefits of Bitcoin are now being seen by mainstream places. I bought cupcakes for bitcoins (at Cups and Cakes on 9th in San Francisco). They have an iPad that's their cash register, they have a ""buy with bitcoin button that they press ... The whole process took 20 seconds.  We can't tell what bitcoins are being used for. (So it's impossible to know what percent of transactions are for black market goods.)  CoinDesk: Once all the bitcoins are mined, won't the miners quit running the Bitcoin ledger system?  Andresen: The miners will still do the work, because you can attach a transaction fee to every transaction, and the transaction fee goes to the miner who validates the (block of) transactions. As mining fees go down, transactions fees are going up ... Transaction fees are voluntary, but if you don't include a transaction fee ... you may have trouble finding a miner that will validate your transaction. (The current average is .001 of a Bitcoin.)  According to our calculations, as Bitcoin scales up, you'll have such a high volume of transactions, the tiny fees will add up to a significant amount of money and it will still be worthwhile for people to do that work.  CoinDesk: How did you feel about the US government action against Mutum Sigillum? Did it surprise you?  Andresen: I wasn't terribly surprised. The legal and regulatory situation with Bitcoin has been murky, and it's getting more clear ... In the grand scheme of things, anything that makes it more clear how Bitcoin businesses can abide by the rules is in the long term a good thing.  CoinDesk: Why didn't the value of the bitcoin crash when it happened?  Andresen: It was one particular way of transferring money to Mt. Gox, which is a Japanese company. There are lots of other exchanges, and there are lots of other ways of transferring money to Mt. Gox. And, it only affected US customers, and a lot of Mt. Gox customers are not in the US. In the grand scheme, it was a small piece of the Bitcoin infrastructure. Once people realized that, you saw the price rebound almost immediately.  CoinDesk: Is there any role at all for government when it comes to regulating Bitcoin?  Andresen: I'm a little controversial in the Bitcoin world because I do think there's a role for government: Consumer protection makes sense. I think where Bitcoins are exchanged for national currencies, it certainly makes sense that whoever controls those national currencies might want to regulate that. While over-regulation doesn't make sense, there is a role for regulation.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/21/already-bigger-than-some-currencies-bitcoin-can-get-bigger-gavin-andresen-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c38130efedc7c032e1f2e1c260dd922d1ab8b02-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376488,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ak7P,1369127501,"Canada confused on Bitcoin, eh?","Some Canadian Bitcoin exchanges have reportedly received letters from financial regulators reassuring them they do not have to follow the detailed rules required by US regulators, and used recently to seize Mt. Gox funds.  According to online news service The Register letters were sent to several Canadian exchanges which said they are not considered money services businesses.  The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FTRACC): ""confirmed the exchanges were not actually money service businesses and were therefore exempt from laws governing this type of firm.""  But this seems at odds with the actions of several Canadian banks who have acted unilateraly to close Bitcoin-related bank accounts.  LibertyBit warned its customers last week that its Royal Bank of Canada account had been shut for breaching rules.  RBC told LibertyBit it was closing its account for two reasons:    RBC had designated Libertybit as a Money Service Business (MSB), and thus considers us a high-risk account;      The virtual currency aspect of the Business' product offering are outside of RBC's risk profile for establishing an account.    LibertyBit appealed the decision on the basis that the bank's definition of its business as a ""Money Services Business"" contradicted that of Canada's regulator. It reassured its customers that the account closure would have no impact on its business.  LibertyBit questioned whether RBC Canada was imposing US rules on a Canadian business but accepted the bank's right to reject any customer based on risk assessments. The exchange's full blog post is here.  The situation is similar in the UK. Although there is anecdotal evidence that Bitcoin businesses have had requests for bank accounts turned down by British banks, financial regulators insist it is nothing to do with them.  CoinDesk was told by the Prudential Regulation Authority (son of the Financial Services Authority) that unless the businesses were offering bitcoin-based investments they would not be covered by regulations.

42376479,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AiIB,1369119064,Bitcoin will ease e-commerce pain says BitPay's Gallippi,"While covering Bitcoin 2013 in San Jose this past weekend, CoinDesk sat down and talked with Tony Gallippi, co-founder and CEO of the payment processing firm BitPay:  CoinDesk: Why do people need BitPay when they can just put their Bitcoin address on their website and get paid for free?  Gallippi: (Without a payment processor) you have no idea who just paid you, or what is it for ...  CoinDesk: What kind of companies need your service?  Gallippi: Ninety percent of our clients are e-commerce ... The companies that we have (feel) the most pain trying to collect payments through the available methods. Credit cards were never designed for the internet ... If they're selling a high-ticket item, they're even more at risk. If a criminal gets their hands on a stolen credit card, they know they have one or two shots to buy the most expensive thing they can buy before that card gets turned off. They buy computers, televisions, gold jewelry... For businesses selling these types of items, they run a huge risk of payment fraud.  CoinDesk: Is there really no fraud with Bitcoin transactions?  Gallippi: People have been trying. The way to do it is to try to execute a double spend. If i have one bitcoin, I want to send it to you and send it to someone else at the same time, and have both of you think you just got paid. The speed of the network now will approve one of those transactions and reject one. To really execute a double spend, you'd have to get involved in bitcoin mining (and spend hundreds of thousands, or maybe millions of dollars) It's just not worth it.  CoinDesk: How did you feel about the US government action against Mutum Sigillum? Did it surprise you?  Gallippi: That really didn't worry us at all. We didn't have any currency in Mt. Gox. It was really just a non-event. What Mt. Gox had set up is a shell company in the United States ... The question is, if the entity here is collecting money from customers and sending it to their parent company, is that considered a transmission activity? Apprently the DHS (Department of Homeland Security) thinks it is and says they're doing it without a license. But I think they're going to have a hard time enforcing that.  CoinDesk: Is there any role at all for government when it comes to regulating Bitcoin?  Gallippi: It's going to be hard to regulate anything that is peer to peer, no matter what it is, like file-sharing music. Anything that's peer to peer, how can the government regulate that? And Bitcoin is open source. How do you regulate something that's open source, that anyone can use? The only way they could regulate it is at the exchange. If you want to buy in or cash out over a certain dollar level, you need an ID. It's the same with casinos.  CoinDesk: What will it take before Bitcoin can become truly mainstream?  Gallippi: It's going to take a while. It's just going to take time. Bitcoin has already been around for four years. Email was around for 10 years before it took off.

42376472,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AiBt,1369118764,Let the Bitchicken and Coinbomb games begin,"Fancy a little bitcoin wager? Online games are now appearing designed to let people play with bitcoins, in the hope of winning big.  Bitcoin transfers are conducted online, and rarely carry any fees. So it's no surprise that carnival-style games of luck and skill are emerging, designed to capitalize on the easy payment mechanism while earning both winners and organizers a little cash.  Two games in particular have captured our interest recently: Bitchicken and Coinbomb.  Bitchicken  is a math-based (of course!) game that relies on bids from players. It collects five bids, in the form of bitcoins, from different players. The winner is the person who bids the closest to 25 percent above the average. This person receives the majority of the payout: 98 percent. The team at Bitchicken collects a 1.9 percent share, leaving the other players to split the remaining 0.1 percent among them as proof that their bids were processed.  Bids are grouped randomly, and the Bitchicken team aims to process each game within the hour (as long as there are enough players wanting to participate).  But it's not all luck, according to the site:  ""Early on, we suspect there will be a lot of bad bids and opportunity for anyone who can see patterns or do basic maths.""  While Bitchicken is mostly a game of guesswork, Coinbomb involves a race against the clock. It's a bit like the old children's game, ""hot potato"".  The Coinbomb site makes ""bombs"" available for purchase. Each bomb is a package representing a certain amount of bitcoins, and carrying a certain interest rate.  When someone grabs a bomb, they pay the initial purchase price. They must then sell it to someone within 24 hours. If they don't, then the bomb ""explodes"" in their hands and they lose the game (and their bitcoins). If they sell, they receive the original purchase price from the buyer, plus extra bitcoins, paid at a predefined rate of interest.  Say, for example, that Jim buys a two-bitcoin bomb with a 15 percent interest rate. If he sells it to Julie, she'll pay him 2.3 bitcoins, earning Jim an extra 0.3 bitcoins over his original purchase price. If Julie then sells to John, John will pay her what she paid, plus 15 percent. But if John can't find someone to buy that bomb within 24 hours, it expires, and he will have lost 2.645 bitcoins.  ""Bomb"" buyers also have a chance for an instant win, which pays up to their entire purchase price. This effectively refunds the total amount they paid, while still leaving them free to sell the bomb ... meaning whatever sale price they negotiate would be pure profit.  The attraction of Coinbomb is that players always stand to make more than they pay. However, the risk increases with each purchase because -- as the bomb's value increases -- there will likely be fewer willing buyers. Players with a large networks of interested friends and colleagues will probably stand a better chance of selling in this game.  Meanwhile, the folks at Coinbomb presumably net the original purchase price of the bomb, conjured (like bitcoins themselves, you might say) from nothing.  With a business model like that, expect to see plenty more Bitchicken- and Coinbomb-type sites emerging onto the scene for game-loving bitcoin fans.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/21/let-the-bitchicken-and-coinbomb-games-begin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d6c552de65b5d5070d0170e3378e1e6cf939a154-628x380.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
