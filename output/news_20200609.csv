42383934,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zMMt,1591736490,Deutsche Borse Exchange to List New Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Product,"London-based investment firm ETC Group plans to list a bitcoin-backed security on the German electronic trading market later this month.      The firm announced Tuesday the exchange-traded product (ETP), called the Bitcoin Exchange Traded Crypto (BTCE), is the world’s first centrally cleared derivative crypto asset, and would be listed on Deutsche Borse’s Xetra market based in Frankfurt, Germany.      Central clearing is a tool used in the European derivatives market to bolster stability by ensuring a financial institution takes on counterparty credit-risk. The crypto security is also backed by bitcoin, with each share giving the holder a claim to a specific amount of the cryptocurrency. According to the company, the physical bitcoin would be stored in a cold vault, meaning one not connected to the internet, operated by Palo Alto, Calif.-based custodian BitGo.      “Investors get the benefit of trading and owning bitcoin through a regulated security, while having the option to redeem bitcoin if they choose,” said Bradley Duke, CEO of ETC Group, in a press statement emailed to CoinDesk.      “It really is a hybrid ETP product that has the same features as an ETF [exchange-traded product]. Because it’s a single asset instrument it doesn’t qualify to be an ETF according to the European fund regime,” explained ETC in an emailed statement.      The novel security is also bound to cost slightly more than traditional ETFs, with an expense ratio of 2% compared to anywhere between 0.5 to 0.7% charged by most ETFs.      According to ETC, “Bringing a product like this into regulated markets is not an easy task, and this is reflected in the premium.”      The unveiling of this new security comes after the German financial authority, BaFin, announced in March it would officially recognize cryptocurrencies as financial instruments. The security will be distributed on the HANetf platform joining other products including a cloud-computing ETF and a medical cannabis ETF.      The bitcoin-backed security will be available in Germany and has also been passported to the UK, Italy and Austria, meaning users in these countries will be able to hold or trade the BTCE shares.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETC,BTC | ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/09/deutsche-borse-exchange-to-list-new-bitcoin-exchange-traded-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aae428320dc80b1e1a76b664899548d0271b0314-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383940,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zMUR,1591736436,Market Wrap: DeFi Is Helping Ether Outpace Bitcoin This Year,"Bitcoin and ether are soundly beating nearly all major global equities indices on the year. Of the two, ether is handily beating bitcoin's price performance when the market is moving higher.      The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH) is trading around $243 and climbed less than a percent in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      At 00:00 UTC on Tuesday (8:00 p.m. ET Monday), ether was hit with high selling volume on exchanges like Coinbase. Its price swung between $239 and $249 within an hour. Since then, ether has been changing hands at around $243, slightly above its 50-day and 10-day moving averages, a bullish technical indicator were it to last.      Since January, ether’s price performance has been steadily outpacing that of bitcoin (BTC). With over 90% in gains since 2020 started, ether holders are beating bitcoin investors because the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up by just over 30% since January.      One of the reasons for ether's boost is the increasing use of decentralized finance, or DeFi, said Peter Chan, a trader for Hong Kong-based crypto firm OneBit Quant. DeFi is used for lending and trading, including derivatives, using the Ethereum network’s smart contract technology instead of third parties providing centralized software.      “This explains why we see bigger pumps on ether than bitcoin when the market moves upwards,” Chan added. “Ethereum is evolving much faster than bitcoin with the rapid growth in DeFi.""      See also: ‘Inherently Borderless’: Acting OCC Chief Talks Crypto, State Licenses and DeFi      Indeed, while dipping considerably during March’s market crash, the amount of U.S. dollar value locked in DeFi has recently surpassed $1 billion once again.      While the amount of price appreciation may have diverged, both bitcoin and ether markets seem to operate in tandem. Since the start of 2020, ether and bitcoin have been heavily correlated.      “With insight, ether has been a better investment than bitcoin from a pure performance point of view so far this year,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at Paris-based quant firm ExoAlpha. “But on the downside, they both behaved identically on downward slides.”      Sasha Goldberg, a senior trading specialist for crypto firm Efficient Frontier, notes ether may rise more than bitcoin but has also dropped more than it, too. “Although it seems that ether outperforms bitcoin, when you look at the bigger picture, bitcoin is down 51% from its all time high while ether is down 83%,” he said.

42383941,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zMLd,1591733104,Moscow Said to Hire Kaspersky to Build Voting Blockchain With Bitfury Software,"Voting and blockchain have been a controversial couple but Moscow appears determined to use the technology for a national referendum involving President Vladimir Putin.      Russia will vote on changing its constitution, adopted in 1993, on July 1. The main issue to be decided is whether to allow Russia's president to stay in power for more than the current limit of two consecutive six-year terms.      Most of the nation will use traditional paper ballots, but residents of Moscow and the Nizhny Novgorod region will have the option of casting their votes electronically and, at least in the Muscovites' case, having them recorded on a blockchain.      According to an official page dedicated to electronic voting, Moscow’s Department of Information Technologies, which is working on the technical solution, plans to use Bitfury’s open-source enterprise blockchain, Exonum.      “The blockchain technology is working in the Proof of Authority mode,” the page says in Russian. “A smart contract for the ballot ledger will be recording the votes in the system, and after the voting is complete it will decode them and publish them in the blockchain system.”      The Department of Information Systems did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time. Bitfury’s spokesperson declined to comment on the company's involvement in the project.      See also: Bitfury Latest to Donate Crypto Mining Power to Coronavirus Research      ""Blockchain-based voting is one of the most important applications of Exonum and blockchain technology overall,"" the spokesperson said. ""We do not have anything to share at this time, but we will stay in touch with future announcements.""      According to several people familiar with the electronic voting project, the company that built the solution for the Moscow authorities was Kaspersky Lab, the popular anti-virus software vendor that has turned to consulting in the blockchain space in recent years. A Kaspersky spokesperson declined to comment.    Bumpy road    Moscow's previous experience with blockchain voting did not go smoothly.      In September, residents of several Moscow districts could vote electronically in city council elections. When the code for the system was published, French security researcher Pierrick Gaudry showed that it could be easily hacked. After the voting was complete one of the losing candidates criticized the system, saying the offline results were not consistent with those submitted electronically.      See also: Bank of Russia Wants to Put Mortgage Issuance on a Blockchain      Roman Yuneman, an independent candidate who ran for a city council seat, published a report describing the weaknesses of the system built by the Moscow authorities. According to the report, the voting had been down for nearly 30% of the time, and Yuneman’s team received 70 complaints from people who could not cast their votes electronically.      Russian news outlet Meduza wrote that the private key for decoding the votes was written into one of the transactions and could be easily retrieved from it, which made it possible to figure out how particular people voted. At the same time, around 12,000 voters’ records were leaked by the system, Meduza reported.      In addition, all the data was collected on servers belonging to the Moscow authorities and was under their complete control, Yuneman wrote. Independent observers could not check the authenticity of the vote count, and in one neighborhood, the offline and online results showed opposite results.    Low trust    “Electronic voting has a lot of issues even without blockchain, and that was clearly demonstrated during the Moscow elections,” said Sergey Tikhomirov, a blockchain researcher and a PhD candidate at the University of Luxembourg.      “There was no technical way to observe it and the administrators of the voting could forge the data at any time. And, unlike with the paper ballots, in this case the forgery leaves no traces,” he said.      Blockchain-based voting has proved a tough nut to crack in other countries as well.      One of the best-known blockchain voting apps, Voatz, was blasted after several pilot tests, with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security pointing out the app's vulnerabilities. So did researchers at MIT.      See also: West Virginia Ditches Blockchain Voting App Provider Voatz      Still, governments around the world have been experimenting with the concept, and blockchain voting tests have been underway in Thailand, South Korea, Sierra Leone and India.      Nir Kshetri, professor of management at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, wrote in October that despite hopes blockchain could make elections more transparent and fair, “there’s no evidence yet that it is better at preventing election fraud.”      At the end, it's the people in power who decide what will be the design of a blockchain voting system and who will have access. The technology does not resolve the issue of trust in the political system, Tikhomirov said.      “If people do trust the election system as such, any method of voting would work, even though the electronic one is riskier anyway. But if there is no trust, the electronic vote makes it even harder to check if the vote count was fair or not,"" he said.

42383935,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zMPP,1591731010,Alchemy Notify Wants to Simplify Blockchain UX With a Single Push,"Alchemy has built a new push notification system for blockchain developers.      Announced Monday, Alchemy Notify is a product designed to enhance the user experience (UX) of various crypto platforms by providing real-time notifications for transactions and events.      Blockchain UX often relies on constant attention from the user, which can be off-putting for those who want to engage in a seamless transaction process. Alchemy Notify is hoping to change that through push notifications to smart devices.      ""Extremely simple and intuitive user experiences are crucial to the mass adoption of blockchain applications,"" said Alchemy CEO and co-founder Nikil Viswanathan. ""Alchemy Notify provides a key building block for a great user experience – notifications.""      It functions by replacing the nodes businesses use to read and write on blockchains with more expedient and scalable infrastructure. It's meant to coexist alongside the developer platform, which offers tools for monitoring, alerting and debugging crypto software.      ""Notify requires extremely technical and nuanced infrastructure to provide the notification capabilities to developers,"" Alchemy CTO and co-founder Joe Lau told CoinDesk via Telegram. ""Notify is powered by the Alchemy Platform, which took years of research and development to build.""      The San Francisco-based firm raised $15 million late last year from Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Samsung, SignalFire and others.      ""In order to bring blockchain to a billion people, we as a community need to focus on building products that are accessible to normal people,"" Lau added. ""Great user experience is an absolute must – users expect blockchain products to be at least as good as, if not better than, traditional web and mobile products.""      Read more: Torus Goes Blockchain-Agnostic With New DirectAuth Dapp Login Tool      That focus is why large names including Augur, 0x, CryptoKitties, Kyber and the Opera browser rely on Alchemy’s blockchain developer platform to solve their UX and design challenges.      Research conducted by Airship suggests push notifications can increase user retention by up to 820% compared to users who receive no push notifications. The data was collected via 63 million app users to determine how they interacted with their smart devices.      Alchemy is betting this can apply to the blockchain ecosystem as well. Events and transactions – such as interest earned, timed events, contracts, token swaps and in-game actions – can be confusing to understand for new users.      “Making it easier to build great user experiences is absolutely crucial for the success of the blockchain industry,"" said Pantera Capital's Paul Veradittakit. ""Alchemy's developer platform continually innovates on empowering developers with new building blocks. Notify will be a game changer for the industry. Just look at what notifications have done for the mobile app ecosystem.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | ZRX | RESEARCH,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/09/alchemy-notify-wants-to-simplify-blockchain-ux-with-a-single-push,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb9ce46202b4e35f806fa96fb1f2a108bfc66dfc-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383936,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zMO9,1591730741,LocalBitcoins' Volume Holds Steady Despite Stricter Compliance Procedures,"Banning cash transactions and requiring identity verification has not noticeably hurt bitcoin’s oldest operating peer-to-peer exchange, market data shows.      Helsinki-based bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins made significant changes to its policies in June 2019. That included mandatory identity verification and removing its cash-for-crypto trading option.      Rather than permanently stifling its business over the past year, volume on the peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange has ebbed and flowed with leading centralized exchanges like OKEx and Coinbase, for example.      Compared to reported volumes of 12 months ago, OKEx and Coinbase have seen volume drop by approximately 30% and 45%, respectively, according to data from Nomics. Since January, however, the two exchanges’ volumes have grown by roughly 2,500% and 800%, respectively. By comparison, LocalBitcoins’ volume is down 27% over the past 12 months and up almost 40% for the year to date.      Read more: CoinMarketCap Metric Overhaul Keeps Owner Binance at the Top      “Cash trades used to be less than 0.5% of all the trades,” a LocalBitcoins spokesperson told CoinDesk. “Removing them didn’t have an impact on our trade volumes.”      Founded in June 2012, LocalBitcoins was created to offer a convenient, global tool for trading bitcoins and “serve people who have limited access to financial services”, according to CEO Nikolaus Kangas. As of 2018, the company generated roughly $27 million in annual revenue.      In 2019, the stalwart peer-to-peer exchange implemented tiered identity verification in an effort to comply with an anti-money laundering directive from the European Commission.      LocalBitcoins reported volumes from Latin American countries are largely responsible for elevating recent aggregate transactions. Over the past two months volumes in Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela, for example, respectively grew by as much as 51%, 46% and 125%. This growth signals “wide and healthy demand growth,” a spokesperson for the exchange told CoinDesk.      Many ideologically motivated bitcoin investors value their personal and financial privacy, which makes them averse to identify verification requirements by cryptocurrency exchanges. Cash-for-bitcoin trades, moreover, are a preferred transaction type for investors who want to buy anonymously.      While LocalBitcoins’ year-old changes may not have pushed away a noticeable number of users, other traders are showing increasing interest in peer-to-peer exchanges that don’t require identity verification. Over the past year, for example, peer-to-peer exchange Hodl Hodl has seen an “influx of relatively big, active traders,” said the exchange's spokesperson.      The lack of a noticeable drop in LocalBitcoins volume after its platform changes suggests its users might not care about privacy as much as other bitcoin investors. For the longevity of the eight-year-old bitcoin exchange, this is encouraging.      “You would’ve seen a drop much earlier in that graph if KYC mattered as much as they say it does,” Alejandro Machado, co-founder of Venezuela-based Open Money Initiative. “I think people generally trust the Finnish company.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/09/localbitcoins-volume-holds-steady-despite-stricter-compliance-procedures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cea0439f951d30e86d265ef7ef7557265de7e883-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Richard Yuan Li, a student at University of California-San Diego, is accused of one count of conspiracy to commit felony wire fraud in connection with the scheme, which hit 19 victims and successfully plundered a “significant portion” of crypto from one, a New Orleans doctor, according to the allegations.      The DOJ filed its charges against Li in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.      It is not clear how much crypto Li and conspirators allegedly stole from the unnamed doctor. According to case filings, the victim had accounts with Binance, Bittrex, Coinbase, Gemini and Poloniex, among others. At one point, one conspirator attempted to extort the victim for 100 bitcoin.      How the alleged SIM swap went down, however, is abundantly clear. Li and his conspirator first tricked an Apple representative into sending them an iPhone 8, “arranged for victims’ telephone numbers to be swapped” to that phone, and then bypassed their target’s security measures to gain access to files, prosecutors claim.      Prosecutors allege Li participated in at least 28 SIM swaps between October 2018 and December 2018. They further allege the actions amount to federal crimes because the SIM swaps transmitted signals across state lines and are therefore subject to the interstate commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.

42383923,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zMAJ,1591722014,"'Inherently Borderless': Acting OCC Chief Talks Crypto, State Licenses and DeFi","If Christopher Giancarlo was “Crypto Dad” and Hester Peirce is “Crypto Mom,” will the U.S.’s new top bank regulator become “Crypto Uncle”?      Brian Brooks, the former Coinbase legal chief, took office as Acting Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) at the end of May, barely two and a half months after being appointed First Deputy at the federal banking agency. In that time he’s already publicly suggested a federal payments charter for fintech companies, asked state and local governments to consider lifting COVID-19 lockdowns to protect the banking system and published a request for public input on how banks look at crypto.      The first proposal might be Brooks’ most ambitious: creating a federal regulatory framework for tech firms offering some services traditionally offered by banks, something industry advocates have long sought but recognized as politically hazardous. A single federal framework would preempt the 50 different state-level money transmitter licenses that companies, including crypto exchanges, currently have to obtain.      This state-by-state requirement requires exchanges to roll out services slowly, dependent on the different approvals rather than their technology stacks and scalability. Since the OCC’s founding in 1863, banks under its charge have been allowed to operate across state lines, but nonbanks looking to operate nationally must secure the numerous state licenses.      Read More: US Banking Regulator Suggests Federal Licensing Framework for Crypto Firms      Brooks told CoinDesk he views the OCC’s role as keeping up with developments in technology and other areas, and ensuring the national banking regulatory framework remains flexible to new tools and how they are being used.      “My job here is not to protect incumbents, and it's not to preserve the status quo,” Brooks said. “You know, I'm not curating a history museum here. The job I have is to make sure that the bank charter’s flexible enough to maintain a safe, sound, strong American economy and the shape of banking has to be flexible to accommodate.”      Part of this evolution includes the fact that banks aren’t the only entities providing what were traditionally seen as banking services, he said, noting technology companies like Stripe provide payment and lending services. Banks themselves have been changing as well over the past several decades: There are banks that aren’t “significant depositories,” including trust banks and credit card banks. There are also more entities that operate nationally, rather than just on the state level.      Some of his ideas, including the payments charter, stem from this need to keep up with the times, he said.      Asked what other areas of crypto the OCC might look into, Brooks mentioned the wild frontiers of decentralized finance (DeFi) and lending as two examples.      “DeFi is in its real infancy...none of that's yet scaled, and yet it is the most interesting thing happening in crypto,” he said. “Is it possible to deliver a full suite of financial services by algorithm, without any central ledger keeper?”      Brooks also said a digital dollar, which he has advocated in the past, is something that should be developed by the government with private entities.      A digital dollar issued and maintained solely by the Federal Reserve “misses the promise of the digital dollar” because it would be a centralized token that is not much different from another electronic ledger, he said.    National payments charter    Brooks’ suggested payments charter would essentially let fintech companies operate under a single national regulatory regime, rather than seek 50 different state-level money transmitter licenses.      “National platforms are bigger, more stable, more competitive for scale businesses,” he said, adding:    “And so my thinking on the charter issue is that there are certain kinds of companies that are engaged in inherently borderless activities payments. AI, for example, crypto is an example there…[I]f they're engaged in the financial business and they're doing it across state lines, wouldn't it be important for my agency to create a national license that allows them to do that business on a national basis, subject to the same kinds of supervision that traditional banks are subject to?”    The OCC’s last attempt at fintech charter was a third rail of sorts.      Proposed in 2016, it would have explicitly allowed fintech firms to apply for bank charters and provide direct lending services. The charter was blocked by a number of state regulators, including the New York Department of Financial Services, and remains in legal limbo while it sits before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. At least one federal judge has already ruled against the OCC.      Brooks anticipates some opposition from state-level regulators if he were to formally pursue a payments charter, and he said at least some of this opposition will come from the fact that states generate revenue by licensing entities.      Read More: US Bank Regulator Opens Door to National License for Bitcoin Firms      “If a state is currently getting paid and all of a sudden there's a federal agency offering [companies], you know, more consistent supervision across the country, that becomes a threat to their revenue model or a threat to their.. jurisdiction” he said.      In Brooks’ view, this shouldn’t be a concern for the states.      The U.S. already has had a dual-banking system in place since around the time of the Civil War when the OCC was created, he noted.      “There are many, many banks chartered by the states out there because it's the right business model for what they're focused on,” he said. “If you're focused on the local and regional business, it makes sense to have a state charter. If you're focused on a national business, it probably makes more sense of a national charter, and ... I don't think there's any tension between those two concepts.”    Broadening scope    Brooks is also interested in seeing how existing banks address crypto and DLT, and whether any of these entities are engaging with or incorporating new tools built on blockchain.      Last week, the OCC published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) soliciting feedback on a number of issues, including how crypto and distributed ledger tech interact with the existing banking system. While the notice explicitly excluded feedback on the payments charter, Brooks said he is still looking for comments on that proposal as well.      In particular, he expects feedback on what requirements or regulations would be needed to make the charter effective, such as if a company needs access to the Federal Reserve’s payment rails to be able to provide better payment services.      “My thought is if those companies are doing those services which historically were done by banks, and those companies were having to cobble together the legal structure to operate on, you know, that is a patchwork of state-by-state stuff,” he said. “Maybe what makes more sense is to bring those companies into the supervised banking system.”      Read More: Digital Dollar Project Calls for 2-Tiered Distribution System in First White Paper for US CBDC      The ANPR was already being developed prior to his arrival at the OCC in mid-March, he said. Crypto companies had previously reached out to the regulator to discuss bank charters, usually with respect to becoming qualified custodians (while there are regulated crypto custodians in the U.S., the vast majority have state trust licenses rather than a federal approval).      Ultimately, Brooks said he hopes to reform how banks treat crypto companies in the U.S., and help “legitimate” companies access banking relationships. JPMorgan Chase made headlines last month when The Wall Street Journal reported it had provided banking services to Coinbase and Gemini. But in general only a handful of smaller banks have been willing to openly service the sector.      “I think there is a perception at banks that somehow crypto is a disfavored asset class, and you shouldn't even provide a payroll account or a corporate deposit account for a company engaging crypto,” he said. “And so what I want to do is make sure that we systematically identify what the impediments are to legitimate companies getting banking relationships, whether it's corporate banking relationships, whether it is custodial services by banks to crypto companies or otherwise.”      He stressed that he would only want companies that are fully compliant with regulations. For example, he would support providing banking relationships to stablecoin issuers that “are properly audited, properly reserved and everything else.”      “We don't want to see a situation blow up as happened with Tether’s original bank in Puerto Rico,” he said, referring to Noble Bank, which serviced Bitfinex and Tether in 2018 amid questions as to whether the USDT stablecoin was fully backed 1-for-1 with dollars. (Noble Bank listed itself for sale in late 2018 after reportedly losing the stablecoin issuer as a client.)    Going mainstream    While Brooks did not explicitly say or indicate he was hoping to bring crypto mainstream during his time at the OCC, his contemplated actions would appear to make that a goal.      Outside strict regulatory updates, he said he’d like to help educate the broader public about crypto.      “I think there is an education that is required. You know, you've heard what the President [of the United States] has said about bitcoin and his skepticism about bitcoin as a store of value equivalent to the dollar. And you know those are concerns many people have,” he said. (President Trump said he was “not a fan” of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in a series of tweets last year.)      Regulatory agencies by and large have the expertise they need around the space, Brooks said. Not just the OCC – the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have also developed a store of expertise. SEC Commissioner Peirce and former CFTC Chairman Giancarlo earned their nicknames after publicly advocating for looser regulatory restrictions around the space.      However, these agencies are limited in how broadly they can apply their oversight, and are required to apply any actions they take to their mandates as defined by law.      Read More: SEC’s Crypto Savvy Surprises Blockchain Insiders at DC Forum      While Congress could help clarify how crypto is defined in the U.S., it has larger issues to address at the moment.      “Crypto is too small relative to the magnitude of other things Congress is thinking about right now,” Brooks said. “We're at a moment of a social justice inflection point in this country. We're in a moment where we have, you know, a response to a pandemic that has created a macroeconomic crisis for the country. And so the idea that Congress is going to turn its attention to this and pass legislation, that's not gonna happen anytime soon, which is proper. I mean, they have bigger fish to fry.”      Still, as new technologies – not just crypto, but fintech firms in general – are already eating into banks’ market share.      “I think what some of these fintech companies show is banks today are a little bit like the department stores of 25 years ago. There was a time…if you needed to buy hardware and clothing and you wanted to go out to lunch, you did all of that at Sears. Nobody shops like that anymore,” Brooks said. “Right now, what they want to do is go to a boutique for their clothing. They go to a special hardware store for their hardware and then they go out to lunch somewhere down the street.”      Fintech firms are the boutiques to major national banks’ department stores, he said, pointing to Stripe and SoFi as two examples.    COVID-19 crisis    Brooks declined to say if he wanted to move beyond being the acting head to become the full-time Comptroller.      “It’s up to the president,” he said.      Still, Brooks acknowledged that his past relationship with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin (Brooks was a vice chairman at Mnuchin’s OneWest Bank) may have played a role in his appointment as First Deputy, and then successor to now-former Comptroller Joseph Otting (another OneWest alum).      Read More: A Former Coinbase Lawyer Is About to Become Acting Head of US Bank Regulator      “I can’t speak to what was in [Mnuchin’s] head, but I’ve known him for a long time and have worked with him in a variety of capacities for a long time,” Brooks said. “In my experience in [Washington], for these kinds of jobs it’s generally not about resume line items. It’s more about who you trust and whose judgement you have seen tested in a crisis.”      Brooks is taking over the OCC at a time of unprecedented financial crisis.      The U.S. entered a recession in February, the National Bureau of Economic Research announced Monday, just days after Brooks said prolonged shutdowns could harm banks.      The acting comptroller said banks were well-capitalized, to the point they would have survived the initial coronavirus crisis even without funding from the Fed and Congress.      “This is the strongest the banking system has ever been going into this crisis,” with banks maintaining deep liquidity and remaining well capitalized,” he said.      Still, “no matter how many months of a rainy day fund you have, if you run out of months, bad things happen.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/09/inherently-borderless-acting-occ-chief-talks-crypto-state-licenses-and-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/984531b1a438faf8afa81b566ebfb94da9d3502e-1500x1003.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Addressing Concerns Brave, a privacy browser, was called out this weekend when users noticed that typing in the name of the leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, resulted in an auto-complete that ended in a referral link, creating the appearance that Brave is tracking visits to the exchange’s website. Brave launched with the idea to reinvent online advertising, where users would receive ads without being followed around the web. Brave founder Brendan Eich said the issue will be remedied, but also suggested the need for Brave to run a profitable business. Meanwhile, Bail Bloc, a service that passively generates Monero to distribute to bail funds, has seen a 20% increase in its hashrate as protests continue to roil across the country.    Market intel    Forking Off Bitcoin’s forks, including bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin gold (BTG) and bitcoin sv (BSV), have outperformed bitcoin itself this year. Individually, bitcoin sv and bitcoin gold have outperformed bitcoin by 61 and 37 percentage points, respectively, since the start of 2020. Cryptocurrencies with low and middle market capitalizations like these bitcoin forks “tend to outperform bitcoin during marketwide bull runs,” said Aditya Das, market analyst at research firm Brave New Coin, and are largely correlated with bitcoin.      Easing Volatility Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has fallen to 40%, the lowest level since March 6, while 60-day volatility declined to 52.18%, its lowest since March 11. The decline in volatility may be associated with the lack of clear directional bias in the market. Bitcoin rallied by over 150% in the two months leading up to the May 11 mining reward halving. Since then, however, the buyers have repeatedly failed to establish a foothold above $10,000. At the same time, downside has been restricted to around $8,600.      Options Increase Bitcoin options trading is growing faster than the futures and swaps market, according to data from Skew. Though bitcoin options are roughly 35% that of futures and swaps, a historical trend signals a rate of growth in options that exceeds growth in that of bitcoin futures and swaps. In traditional financial markets, options open interest and trading volumes are “generally a multiple of futures,” said Su Zhu, co-founder of cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.

42383926,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zME5,1591718775,Number of Institutions Buying Crypto Futures Doubled in 2020: Fidelity Report,"Fidelity's digital asset subsidiary found the number of U.S. institutional investors buying crypto derivative products jumped significantly in 2020.    Fidelity Digital Assets said institutional sentiment was improving in relation to cryptocurrencieshttps://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/FDAS/institutional-investor-study.pdf. ""[A]lmost 80% of investors surveyed finding something appealing about the asset class,"" it said.    But what's far more interesting is right down in the guts of the survey. Talking about how institutional investors are increasing their portfolio allocation to cryptocurrencies – the top one, unsurprisingly, being bitcoin – it goes on to say, ""22% of U.S. respondents invested in digital assets have exposure via futures, which is a substantial increase relative to 9% of U.S. investors surveyed in 2019.""      The survey, which took place between November and March, spoke to 774 institutions in the U.S. and in Europe, with 393 coming from the U.S. That means around 86 U.S. institutions traded crypto futures this year, compared to just 40 in the 2019 survey.      Fidelity's report ventures that the ""recent market growth in the number of crypto native and incumbent service providers offering cash and physically settled futures contracts"" may help explain this large increase in crypto futures exposure among institutions.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: Mining Derivatives Point to Growing Sophistication      Boston-based Fidelity Investments is one of the largest asset managers in the world. In a press release, it claims to have more than $7.9 trillion worth of client assets under administration. In 2018, it unveiled its digital assets wing to provide custody and trade execution services for U.S.-based institutional investors. In December last year, it set up a new entity to service institutions in Europe.      The survey, which was released Tuesday, also found 36% of respondents – 279 institutions in the U.S. and Europe – were currently already invested in digital assets. Hedge funds and venture funds were the two buckets with the greatest exposure, although Fidelity also found a strong showing among family offices and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs).      ""These results confirm a trend we are seeing in the market towards greater interest in and acceptance of digital assets as a new investable asset class,"" commented Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets.      Interestingly, it appears European institutions (45%) were much more likely to hold crypto compared to their American counterparts (27%). This trend also played out in sentiment, where 82% of European institutional investors found something appealing about digital assets, as opposed to 74% in the U.S.      See also: CME Says Volume Surge Shows Strong Institutional Interest Before Bitcoin Halving      Still, the survey did not specify what led U.S. institutional investors to up their exposure to crypto futures. CoinDesk reported on a CryptoCompare report last week that found crypto derivatives trading volumes soared to $602 billion in May, a new all-time high. Options contracts, in particular, appeared to show the biggest increase, compared to the month before.      At the time, CryptoCompare CEO Charles Hayter said the increase may indicate a ""more sophisticated, diverse class of investor” coming to the market.      CoinDesk reached out to Fidelity for more information such as whether the products were solely bitcoin-based futures and which platforms, like BitMEX or CME, institutions were using to buy crypto futures.

42383933,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zMKN,1591714716,Your Property Rights Should Extend to Social Media,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is a partner at Castle Island Ventures, a venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass., that focuses on public blockchains. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.      There are, to put it reductively, two schools of thought on the topic of property rights on internet platforms. The first goes something like this:    Systems like Facebook, Twitter, Google and the like are private platforms, run and administered by corporate entities, and those entities may control the contents of those platforms as they see fit. This extends to banning, censorship, arbitrary content removal, alteration and so on. None of these internet oligopolies “owe anyone a platform” and they have no obligation to amplify any particular voices. If you don’t like it, build an alternative and compete in the free market.    While this is by far the most popular view expressed on the topic, very occasionally you might hear an alternative, dissenting opinion. It goes like this:    Internet oligopolies are not just “social media platforms.” They are novel, alternative jurisdictions where users settle and build social and commercial relationships. While they are not physically instantiated, they are genuine places, with all the considerations that entails. Terms of service in these digital frontiers actually constitute legal systems, albeit poorly codified and unaccountable ones. What users do when they occupy handles and build out reputations and social graphs on these systems is create property. Thus censorship, de-platforming, and the like must be understood as eminent domain and expropriation, rather than a mundane application of rules.    Under this alternative view, espoused by thinkers like Elaine Ou, Allen Farrington and Balaji Srinivasan, Facebook, Twitter, et al, did not really create all the content on their platforms, nor do they really own it. Instead, they define a namespace that users occupy, build upon, and in some cases commercialize. The users, not the administrators, create the vast majority of the value, and as such are the rightful owners of their digital property.      You might think this is crazy. But in a sense squatters asserting their property rights against an authority that lays a blanket claim to them would be nothing new. That’s the legal struggle that defined the history of the American continent. (For a full treatment, see chapter five of Hernando De Soto’s ""Mystery of Capital."") Initially, large tracts of land were claimed primarily by the states and absentee landowners. Over time, squatters were able to argue persuasively they had put sufficient labor into their homesteads to legally ratify their informal claims. On the internet, asserting rights to property has proved more challenging, giving rise to our present reality where content creators are providers rather than owners.      See also: Nic Carter - The Last Word on Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption      The default narrative has suffered some blows lately. The rise of more intrusive fact-checking on platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram has called into question their neutrality. The emphasis on algorithmic curation of content rather than linear timelines allows the architects of these systems to pick winners and losers, selectively boosting topics of their choosing. The growth of implicitly state-controlled platforms like TikTok, where China-directed censorship is a key design feature, has made it clear these systems are powerful tools for power projection. And the consolidation of internet platforms into static oligopolies — Facebook and Google jointly control at least 60% of the digital ad market — has dented the theory that users can simply just move elsewhere.      In the face of this overt politicization of purportedly neutral platforms, the theory of digital property rights that stresses the primacy of the individual (i.e. the second view) looks decidedly more attractive. But what exactly are the moral grounds upon which individuals can formalize a claim to their digital property? Lockean theory (see Elaine Ou above) posits that mingling one’s labor with some unallocated natural resource – for instance, by tilling the soil and growing crops – endows an individual with the bequeathable right to that property. The most controversial element of Locke’s theory stipulates the enclosure of some land for the purpose of creating property is morally acceptable if that enclosure doesn’t disadvantage anyone else. In Locke’s words:      Nor was this appropriation of any parcel of land, by improving it, any prejudice to any other man, since there was still enough and as good left, and more than the yet unprovided could use.      Now, if you consider the American frontier, the process of enclosure required the forcible expulsion of the local Native American population, so the proviso appears problematic at best in that context. But in the context of the post-scarcity digital frontier, Locke’s proviso holds weight: Creating an account on Twitter hardly disadvantages anyone. By creating a new, infinitely extensible frontier, an unambiguous moral case exists for the enclosure and allocation of property, without the precondition of violence.      I don’t expect the property view of digital platforms to be persuasive to all. Even so, it functions well descriptively. Instead of accepting the fraying default view you can simply begin to imagine all of the internet platforms that exist today as a constellation of digital nations, each with their own legal code and with varying levels of respect for the property of users.    On the internet, asserting rights to property has proved more challenging, giving rise to our present reality where content creators are providers rather than owners.    Unfortunately, property rights on the largest platforms are both poorly codified (the Terms of Services are crazy shifting sands, arbitrarily sanctioning user behavior, implemented by unaccountable bureaucrats) and notoriously weak. Users cannot easily extricate their social graphs and followers should they choose to leave; they find themselves deprived of their commercially and socially valuable property at a moment’s notice with no recourse and they cannot influence decision-making. To make a political analogy, virtually all of these digital worlds operate as pre-democratic feudal regimes, with every participant a digital serf who tills the land at the pleasure and discretion of a capricious feudal lord.      The property view equips us to better understand digital society. We can expect that if the major platforms continue to operate as unaccountable fiefdoms, users will gravitate towards systems that are more politically stable, those that enumerate and define the rights of users (rather than just listing, Ten Commandments-style, various bannable offenses), and enshrine genuine protections of property.      Understood this way, it’s clear the current largest internet platforms are taking an unsustainable approach to digital governance. If the administrators of these systems were forward-looking, they would seek to stabilize the legal structure of their systems and clearly lay out the rights of users, as no one wants to build on a shifting foundation. It’s well established that something as basic as a legal philosophy (for instance, the presence of common versus civil law) has far reaching impacts on economic growth. And thanks to De Soto, we know that giving individuals the ability to formalize a claim to some property they own is the genesis of productive and healthy capitalism. So it stands to reason that the first platform to carefully codify rules and give users strong guarantees over their property will gain market share.      See also: Nic Carter - How Blockchains Become Great Big Garbage Patches for Data      The popular internet platforms most likely cannot make this transition. They exist in a very real political context and are coerced into following local laws and intervening in political disputes by selectively banning individuals and de-boosting particular topics. Since internet platforms grant governments almost infinite leverage when it comes to controlling speech, infiltrating and co-opting those companies is an urgent, active priority for state actors.      We wonder whether any alternatives to these shoddy systems are emerging. The good news is that some diligent entrepreneurs have been pursuing this vision for some time now. In 2009, a group of cypherpunks created a system of property that was user-defined, issued freely and fairly, one in which ownership was a function of one’s knowledge of cryptographic secrets. The slots in the ledger didn’t mean anything, but they came to possess financial value — because society unsurprisingly treasured a system of property which was state and oligarch independent. In a sense, Bitcoin offers some of the strongest protections for digital property ever devised, shrugging off state rules and making eminent domain, civil asset forfeiture, inflation, censorship and other forms of implicit and explicit seizure extremely difficult to impose.      Other builders took inspiration from Bitcoin’s treatment of property rights, envisioning systems in which knowledge of a private key is the arbiter of identity, instead of an entry in the database of a Silicon Valley megacorp. This is the idea underscoring the Web 3.0 movement, which has stagnated since its popularization in 2017/18. But the concept is profound: equip users to formalize their own social graph and tie a reputation to an online entity with the absolute right to withdraw or migrate should they be mistreated by their local platform administrator. The precise form this will take is not clear. But it is an idea whose time has come.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | WALLET,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/09/your-property-rights-should-extend-to-social-media,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67ef2f247c332b260cfa481ac000c3895589a832-1780x1191.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383924,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zMBZ,1591710732,Ripple Says XRP Lawsuit Fails to Show CEO Committed Fraud,"Ripple and CEO Brad Garlinghouse say an ongoing lawsuit fails to show how Garlinghouse committed fraud when allegedly selling millions of dollars' worth of XRP in 2017.      Lawyers representing the San Francisco-based blockchain company said in a court motion Monday that lead plaintiff Bradley Sostack has not demonstrated how a series of supposedly fraudulent statements made by Garlinghouse and Ripple employees were anything of the kind.      In the U.S., the threshold for what can be considered fraud is based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which stipulates a plaintiff must show two things: first, how fraud was actually committed; second, that it was done so with scienter – i.e the defendants knew they were misleading others.      Ripple's lawyers argue the plaintiff's amended complaint – which was filed in March – did not fulfill the first pre-requisite:      ""Plaintiff’s FAC [first amended complaint] identifies the allegations that purport to contain false statements,"" reads the filing. But these ""alleged misrepresentations"" cannot be shown to be considered fraudulent and ""Plaintiff does not (and cannot) explain how and why these statements are false.""      See also: Mysterious Company Files New Lawsuit Over Ripple’s $1.1B XRP Sale      In the case of Garlinghouse, the plaintiff circles around a statement he made on Dec. 14, 2017, when, after being asked if he held any XRP as an investment, he said he was ""very, very long XRP as a percentage of my personal balance sheet.""      In the amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges the XRP ledger shows Garlinghouse ""sold any XRP he received from Ripple within days of such receipt"" and that, rather than being long, ""he was dumping XRP on retail investors in exchange for dollars and other cryptocurrency.""      In total, Sostack claims Garlinghouse sold 67 million XRP tokens (worth roughly $58 million on Dec. 14) in 2017, which, he alleges, counts as a misrepresentation as it coincides with the time he was also publicly claiming to be ""very, very long XRP.""      But Ripple disputes the statement was fraudulent. The lawyers first contest Sostack's claim that Garlinghouse sold a sizable share of his tokens: ""Plaintiff fails to plead ... what percentage of his personal balance sheet the alleged sales constitute.""      They then argue that just because Garlinghouse sold XRP doesn't mean he wasn't still bullish on the token's prospects: ""Selling a portion of one’s XRP holdings does not mean that the seller cannot also be 'very, very long' in the same asset as a percentage of his or her own personal balance sheet.""      The filing continues: ""By way of example, a wine collector who amasses a vast collection of fine wines can be said to be 'long' on wine as a percentage of her net worth – that does not change if the collector decides to sell a few (or even many) bottles.""      See also: Ripple Sues YouTube for Allowing ‘Scams’ That Promise Free XRP      Ripple's lawyers are asking the court to dismiss all three counts of fraud without leave to amend and with prejudice. That would will forbid the plaintiff from re-accusing the company, or Garlinghouse, on similar allegations for the remainder of the lawsuit.

42383931,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zMJ7,1591707600,NEAR Protocol Enlists Bison Trails for Validator Support as It Heads Toward Full Mainnet,"Infrastructure-as-a-service firm Bison Trails has added support for yet another “Ethereum killer”: NEAR Protocol.      Inked Tuesday, Bison Trails will help host the newly launched NEAR Protocol’s validator set, currently consisting of over 150 nodes including some 40 of the project’s investors. The NEAR Foundation announced the closing of a $21.6 million sale of its NEAR token, led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), on May 4.      “What we’re doing with it is helping people run their own NEAR validators and, if they don’t want to run a validator, they can delegate to the Bison Trails NEAR community validator,” Bison Trails protocol specialist Viktor Bunin told CoinDesk.      Read more: NEAR Protocol Launches Following $21M Token Sale Led by Andreessen Horowitz      The NEAR Foundation launched its chain in stealth on April 22 under the Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm, which delegates the ability to approve transactions to the Foundation and token validators. Bison Trails will help launch validators while the network continues to execute its roadmap.      NEAR operates as a base layer for running decentralized applications (dapps) but is pinning its hopes on dynamic sharding technology to increase scalability.      Sharding breaks data into silos across a network, unlike traditional blockchains that store data on every computer, also referred to as a node, across the network. The technique is currently being explored for various blockchains to increase throughput, including Ethereum in a running project dubbed Eth 2.0.      Read more: Vitalik Buterin Clarifies Remarks on Expected Launch Date of Eth 2.0      Bison Trails will also be supporting NEAR’s dynamic sharding, which re-shuffles data across shards depending on network activity. While that feature has not yet been added, Bunin said it helps Bison Trails maintain its own network which now supports 11 networks.      “It’s perfect for us because [we] built our platform to support many validators simultaneously and make it incredibly easy to add new validators or scale down the validator count. It’s perfect for a network like NEAR when dynamic sharding is activated,” Bunin said.      NEAR Protocol co-founder Illia Polosukhin told CoinDesk the protocol will move into phases 1, 2 and 3 later this summer, inching the network to unrestricted mainnet and its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.      Read more: Network Bringing Bitcoin to DeFi Taps Libra Member Bison Trails for Staking Services      Polosukhin said the project has a few dozen professional validators – often hired by venture firms holding NEAR tokens – to execute transactions while the network remains in restricted mode. Those validators receive a stipend for running NEAR nodes to offset the costs associated with approving transactions until inflation rewards are allocated once the PoS network launches, he said.      Bison Trails was hired due to the ease of spinning up a NEAR node on its infrastructure, Polosukhin said.",POSITIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | NEAR | TOKEN SALE,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/09/near-protocol-enlists-bison-trails-for-validator-support-as-it-heads-toward-full-mainnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b24d9bd772f8d0d8c285241c6943cb35069fdf2-1121x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383939,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zMTB,1591704043,"First Mover: Crypto Broker Voyager's Stock Has Doubled This Year, Beating Bitcoin","For investors looking to bet on the coming adoption of digital assets, there might be a stock for that: Shares of the cryptocurrency retail broker Voyager Digital are outperforming this year, with triple the year-to-date returns of bitcoin.      Crypto markets, just 11 years old, are evolving fast, with more than 5,500 digital-tokens now in existence, many of them trotted out by entrepreneurs with scant revenue to speak of, few proven use cases and minimal supervision from government regulators.      So there's something to be said for those crypto firms that embrace the scrutiny that comes with being a public company – from investors and regulators alike.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Voyager Digital is one such company, a New York-based broker that aims to help individual investors buy and trade cryptocurrencies. Shares in the company, which went public in February 2019 through a reverse merger, are listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and traded in over-the-counter markets.      On Monday, its stock price tumbled 18% to 47 cents, the biggest drop in nearly three months, after Voyager announced it had raised $2.2 million through a dilutive sale of new equity via a private placement led by investors including Susquehanna, Streamlined Ventures and the CNBC personalities Jon and Pete Najarian.      The money will be used partly to fund an expansion of the company's business beyond its core U.S. market into Canada and eventually Europe, CEO Steve Ehrlich told First Mover in a phone interview.      Voyager is a penny stock, so volatility is a part of the bargain. And indeed, the shares had shot up last week, so even after Monday's sell-off, they're still double where they started out 2020.      That compares with a 35% year-to-date return for bitcoin.      Crypto stocks straddle cutting-edge digital-asset technology and traditional Wall Street markets. Benefits for public companies include easier capital raising and potentially free publicity with every headline that crosses. Trade-offs include stricter reporting requirements and the need to stomach wide swings in the ever-visible share price.      It's a very different model from many of the crypto industry's largest companies, mostly private concerns like the exchanges Binance and Coinbase and the mining computer maker Bitmain Technologies. Disclosures on the companies' underlying financial health are harder to find, if available at all.      ""Everything we do is scrutinized by auditors, and every decision we make as a board and as a company, we know is something that is potentially disclosable,"" Ehrlich said. ""A private company has a lot more wiggle room and can do things that never get shared.""      Here's how glaring that disclosure can be: Last month, Voyager reported an operating loss of $1.78 million during the three months ended March 31, narrower than the $2.8 million deficit during the same period a year earlier.      And its cash dwindled to $1.7 million from $3.1 million in June 2019, even after private-placement capital increases totaling more than $3 million.      Another disclosure that might raise eyebrows: According to a May 20 regulatory filing, Voyager in recent months got two loans totaling more than $1 million from a U.S. government coronavirus-related relief fund, the Paycheck Protection Program.      Many private companies doubtless took the money without the need for immediate disclosure; some $511 billion of the loans were approved as of last week. But for public companies, accepting the financing meant also embracing the risk of any stigma or scrutiny that might come with the revelation.      ""We felt comfortable upon conversations with counsel that taking the money was a fair step for us,"" Ehrlich said. The financing is helping to pay for three or four new hires, he said.      It goes without saying Voyager is still an early startup company, focused on longer-term trends in the crypto industry. There's been a lot of talk recently about big hedge funds and money managers nosing into the cryptocurrency market, and Ehrlich says he believes that serving retail investors will become a major growth market in its own right.      Ehrlich is a former executive of the online stock broker E*Trade, which helped to shake up the brokerage industry in the 2000s with its electronic trading tools and expensive Super Bowl commercials. So he's comfortable with the idea that losses in the single-digit millions of dollars might someday turn to profits in the billions.      Many companies tread that road to profitability in private before going public with an initial public offering. Companies have raised more than $23 billion in IPOs this year on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, including Warner Music Group, which raised more than $1.9 billion.      It puts Voyager's $29.8 million market capitalization into context. Not exactly a unicorn.      But at least the valuation is public and based on the collective judgment of markets. Ehrlich says that in some ways it's easier for the company to raise new money – such as in Monday's private placement – because he can offer new investors the chance to get in at a valuation predicated on a market-determined share price.      ""I always have questions when I see valuations on private companies,"" Ehrlich said. Meanwhile, ""I have a currency that is quite attractive for people in looking to do not just organic growth but for mergers and acquisitions.""      Ehrlich said that, based on internal projections, his company has enough cash on hand to make it through 2021, when, also according to projections, the firm will turn cash-flow positive.      In the meantime, he says, some of the company's customers now jump on its periodic business-update conference calls and webcasts. It might be their way of assuring themselves that their cryptocurrencies are safe with Voyager.      There's no assurance, of course, that Voyager will eventually grow out of its penny-stock status – or that its stock price will continue to outperform bitcoin.      But at least investors and customers will know what the company is up to, and how it's doing.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,714 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,870| 24-Hr Low: $9,610      Trend: Bitcoin's struggle for clear directional bias continues with prices trapped in the trading range of $9,350–$9,900 for the seventh straight day.      Technical indicators like a golden crossover on the daily chart, a long-term bull cross on the three-day chart, and the positive reading on the weekly MACD histogram suggest the path of least resistance is to the higher side. A slide in the number of coins held on exchanges is also painting a bullish picture, as investors choose to hold.      As such, one may expect the ongoing consolidation to pave the way for stronger gains. However, the technical indicators mentioned above are based on historical data and tend to lag prices.      Additionally, the upward trend from the March low of $3,867 looks to have run out of steam. The cryptocurrency has failed multiple times to keep gains above $10,000 over the last four weeks and recently dived out of an ascending channel drawn from the March 13 and April 21 lows and the March 20 and May 7 highs.      Meanwhile, the Chaikin money flow indicator, which takes into account both prices and volumes, is printing negative values on the weekly chart. That indicates selling pressure is stronger than the buying pressure right now.      As a result, a pullback to $9,000 cannot be ruled out. A violation there would expose the higher low of $8,630 created on May 25. On the higher side, the high of $10,500 reached in February is the level to beat for the bulls.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/09/first-mover-crypto-broker-voyagers-stock-has-doubled-this-year-beating-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b427bce05a5c5f211c7fa9dfa76414abcd32cc15-1866x1133.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The leading cryptocurrency’s 30-day volatility has now fallen to 40%, the lowest level since March 6, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. Meanwhile, 60-day volatility declined to 52.18%, its lowest since March 11.      The decline in volatility may be associated with the lack of clear directional bias in the market.      Bitcoin rallied by over 150% in the two months leading up to the May 11 mining reward halving. Since then, however, the buyers have repeatedly failed to establish a foothold above $10,000. At the same time, downside has been restricted to around $8,600.      The range has tightened in the last few days, with the cryptocurrency trading between $9,300 and $9,900.      A prolonged period of low-volatility price consolidation often paves the way for a big move on either side. The longer the consolidation, the more violent is the breakout/breakdown.      However, while the cryptocurrency is stuck in a narrowing price range, the volatility metrics haven’t yet reached abnormally low levels.      Thirty-day volatility is still hovering well above 32.84% – the low reached on Feb. 15. Bitcoin topped out near $10,500 in mid-February and fell by over 63% in the following two weeks.      Historical data shows that bitcoin tends to chart sudden big moves following a fall in volatility to or lower than 35%.      For instance, volatility hit a low of 35% on Sept. 21, 2019, and in the following three days, the cryptocurrency fell by nearly $2,300. The sharp rise from $6,800 to $9,500 seen in January was preceded by a drop in volatility to a multi-month low of 33%.      See also: First Mover: Crypto Broker Voyager’s Stock Has Doubled This Year, Beating Bitcoin      So bitcoin may consolidate for a few more days before charting a big move in either direction. The slide in bitcoin balances held on exchanges suggests prices may move the higher side. However, some technical indicators suggest otherwise.    3-day chart    The MACD histogram, which is used to identify trend changes and trend strength, has produced lower highs, contradicting higher highs on price. That bearish divergence is indicative of weakening upward momentum and often precedes notable price pullbacks.      The cryptocurrency’s repeated failure to keep gains above $10,000 is also echoing similar sentiments.      The technical outlook would turn bullish if prices rise above $10,500. At press time, bitcoin is trading near $9,680, representing a 1.1% decline on the day.

42383927,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zMFL,1591696853,"Crypto Forensics Firm Chainalysis Adds Tracing Support for Zcash, Dash","Blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis is drawing back the curtain on privacy coins.      Chainalysis announced Monday its Reactor and Know Your Transaction (KYT) products can now trace zcash and dash, two privacy coins whose technical underpinnings theoretically make their transaction flows difficult for investigators to follow. Both have been delisted by global exchanges wary of regulatory scrutiny.      Chainalysis’ support poses a likely challenge to their secretive reputation, however. Chainalysis said that it can partially trace over 99% of zcash transactions and perform “successful investigations” on the handful of dash transactions transferred through “PrivateSend.”      The coins, which together account for $1.5 billion in daily crypto trading volume, broadens the reach of Chainalysis’ two key products: Reactor, an crypto investigations platform whose clients include the U.S government, and KYT, a real-time transaction monitor for exchanges that previously covered 90% of all crypto transactions.      In a blog post that downplayed how private these “privacy coins” actually are, Chainalysis said it can follow dash and zcash transactions without completely co-opting user privacy or leaving investigations at dead ends.      “The two cryptocurrencies’ privacy features – both in how they’re built as well as how they’re used in the real world – leave room for investigators and compliance professionals to investigate suspicious or illicit activity and maintain compliance,” Chainalysis said.      Dash’s PrivateSend mixes multiple fund transfers together as an optional core feature. But dash is technologically similar to bitcoin, and the techniques that Chainalysis said prove successful on CoinJoin bitcoin mixers also work on dash.      Zcash, a privacy coin by design, offers a “shielded pool” service that encrypts wallet addresses, balances and transactions via the zero knowledge proof zk-SNARK. Chainalysis said this encryption is hardly insurmountable; only about 0.9% of zcash transactions are shielded right now.      “So even though the obfuscation on zcash is stronger due to the zk-SNARK encryption, Chainalysis can still provide the transaction value and at least one address for over 99% of ZEC activity,” Chainalysis said.      Additionally, Chainalysis said zcash usage patterns could serve to undermine their party’s anonymity.      Jonathan Levin, chief of strategy at Chainalysis, said the additions may prompt exchanges to consider relisting or adding dash and zcash, both of which have been delisted from global exchanges in the past.      “We seek to provide transaction monitoring software to anyone who wants to be able to transact in different currencies, and I think that we may see businesses become more comfortable with these coins as a result,” he said.",NEUTRAL,ZEC,BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | ZEC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/09/crypto-forensics-firm-chainalysis-adds-tracing-support-for-zcash-dash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f20a9d21a8cf171f5d9adeceaae04a9692150ad-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One of the oldest federal law enforcement agencies in the country, the USMS has updated its request for information it put out on April 24 to a contract relating to virtual currency management and disposal services, as first reported by The Block.      ""This includes but is not limited to such activities as accounting, customer management, audit compliance, managing blockchain forks, wallet creation and management, private encryption key generation and safekeeping, backup and recovery of private encryption key material, airdrops, etc., as well as future actions associated with the virtual currency forfeiture process,"" a description of the contract on the the U.S. government's SAM database reads.
