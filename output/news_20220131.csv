42423793,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2genh,1643671800,First Mover Asia: Crypto Finishes Bad Month on High Note,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin ended a bad January on a positive note; DeFi trading volume grew steadily.  Technician's take: BTC's January sell-off could attract short-term buyers.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $38.446 +1%  Ether (ETH): $2,682 +2.6%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Chainlink LINK +7.2% Computing  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM −7.8% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC −7.1% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP −5.7% Computing  Markets  S&P 500: 4,515 +1.8%  DJIA: 35,131 +1.1%  Nasdaq: 14,239 +3.4%  Gold: $1,797 +0.4%  Market moves  Bitcoin ended the last day of a bearish January in the green, while overall trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) closed at nearly $100 billion in volume for the month.  At the time of publication, the oldest cryptocurrency was changing hands at about $38,500, up slightly over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. Ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up 2.7% to over $2,600 in the same time period.  “Bitcoin is rallying as risky assets finish a very bad January on a positive note,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, the Americas, wrote in his daily market update. “Bitcoin bullish momentum is slowly building up and it could surprise to the upside if the dollar continues to weaken as much of the Fed tightening for the year begins to get priced in.”  Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s trading volume across major crypto exchanges was significantly lower than a week ago. Many stock indexes in Asia were closed amid the weeklong lunar New Year (also known as Chinese New Year) holidays. Many crypto traders in the region may also have taken time off.  Meanwhile, decentralized exchanges reported nearly $100 billion in trading volume in January, according to Dune Analytics. The total trading volume in DEXs previously dropped significantly following its peak last May. But the high volume has returned in recent months.  Some of January’s volume may be associated with the volatility of the markets and the drama in decentralized finance protocol Wonderland, and yet one analyst said the steadily growing volume shows a “renewed growth” in the DeFi sector.  “The flawless execution without downtime, or the amazing ability for these protocols to run uninterrupted even amidst drama from founders/developers and declining asset prices…should be the focus,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto investment managing firm Arca, wrote in his blog dated Monday. “There is a thriving underlying ecosystem despite one-off scams, hacks, and ousted bad actors.”  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holding Support Above $37K; Resistance at $40K-$45K  Bitcoin was rising toward the top of a weeklong trading range as oversold signals remain intact. Oversold refers to investors believing the asset is trading below its true value. BTC was trading at about $38,500 at press time and is up 4% over the past week.  Initial resistance is seen at $40,000, which is an old support level that was rejected on Jan. 20. Buyers will need to make a decisive move above $40,000-$45,000 in order to reverse the downtrend that has been in place since November.  For now, BTC’s 20% price decline in January could attract short-term buyers. Traders could place additional bids heading into the Asia trading day if support at $37,000 holds.  Over the long term, upside appears limited given negative momentum signals.

Silvergate Bank confirmed Monday that it's purchasing the technology and other assets from Diem, the stablecoin project from Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) first announced as Libra in June 2019.  In a statement Monday, the Diem Association said it would “begin the process of winding down” both the group and its subsidiaries over the next few weeks.  Silvergate announced in a press release late Monday that it is acquiring Diem’s development, deployment and operations tools, as well as tools “for running a blockchain-based payment network” for remittances and other applications.  It described Diem’s work as running “in a pre-launch phase.” Diem has faced stiff regulatory headwinds since it was first announced in June 2019. Rumors that Diem was looking to sell its assets to repay investors have been swirling since last week.  Read more: Diem Mulling Sale of Assets to Pay Back Investors: Report  In Diem’s statement, CEO Stuart Levey said, “a senior regulator informed us that Diem was the best-designed stablecoin project the U.S. Government had seen.”  But he added that “it became clear” from the group’s conversations with federal regulators that they would not be able to launch Diem.  Silvergate said it issued $132 million in Class A common shares and paid an additional $50 million in cash to acquire the assets. At press time, Silvergate’s share price was trading at $107.74, up 13.4% on the day.  Silvergate partnered with the Diem Association last year to try to launch a dollar-backed stablecoin. Under the terms of that arrangement, Silvergate would both manage the reserves and issue the stablecoin itself. That planned pilot program reportedly met with resistance from federal banking regulators.  In a statement, Silvergate CEO Alan Lane said his bank is “committed to continuing to foster the open-source community that supports the technology, and we believe that existing contributors will be excited about our vision going forward.”  He said his bank found a need for a dollar-backed stablecoin that is both “regulated and highly scalable.” Silvergate intends to launch such a stablecoin by the end of the year.

Part Five: Conflict Of Interest The increase in the price of Litecoin has been driven by relief in larger cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The latter has been showing bullish momentum in lower timeframes and could see more profits in the coming weeks. Selling pressure triggered by macro factors has been and will remain mitigated during February. As NewsBTC reported earlier, this month has been historically bullish for Litecoin and the crypto market. No doubt, the recent announcement of LTC&apos;s MimbleWimble upgrade as a Release Candidate or beta could have a long-term bullish impact on Litecoin.

42423795,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2geph,1643665055,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rises Above $38K Ahead of Seasonally Strong February,"Bitcoin (BTC) returned above $38,000 on Monday as bearish sentiment faded. The cryptocurrency was up 2% over the past 24 hours, versus a 4% rise in ether (ETH) over the same period. Metaverse tokens MANA and SAND were up 17% and 9%, respectively, on Monday.  It appears selling pressure is starting to wane after a rough start to the year. In the bitcoin options market, the put-call open interest ratio, which measures the number of open positions in put options relative to those in calls, rose to a six-month high of 0.62 on Sunday. A higher put-call ratio is typically viewed as a contrarian indicator, suggesting bearish sentiment is near a peak.  Historically, bitcoin produces positive returns in February, which could offer some hope for bullish traders. Technical indicators suggest short-term buyers could remain active around the $35,000-$37,000 support zone, although upside appears to be limited toward $45,000.  Despite the recent price bounce, some analysts remain skeptical because macroeconomic and regulatory risks remain elevated.  ""Regulation concerns arise as the Biden administration prepares to release an executive order in February to regulate bitcoin as a matter of national security,"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""It is hard to predict whether this executive order will have a positive or negative impact on the industry.""  ""The situation in the crypto market remains very fragile. Bitcoin could end up falling for the third month in a row,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.

Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  February recovery?  Over the past nine years, bitcoin produced an average return of 12% in February, and ended the month with a gain 86% of the time, according to data compiled by StockCharts. Generally, equities also perform well during the second quarter, which means investors could start to increase their exposure to speculative assets.  ""We see a short-term setup forming for a bounce, especially on a close back above $40K BTC and $3K ETH"" in February, QCP Capital, a crypto trading firm, wrote in a Monday report. The firm also expects market expectations for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike to moderate over the next two months, which could benefit equities and cryptocurrencies.  Still, historical returns is no guarantee of future returns.  Crypto fund flows rise  Investors put money into cryptocurrency funds for a second straight week as the bitcoin market stabilized following one of its worst-ever starts to a year.  Crypto funds saw inflows of $19 million during the seven days through Jan. 28, according to a report Monday from the digital-asset manager CoinShares.  Notably, some $22.1 million flowed into bitcoin-focused funds last week, while Ethereum-focused funds suffered outflows of $26.8 million. Read more here.

42423778,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2geJh,1643665034,Stablecoins Won Crypto Markets in January – With 0% Returns,"In January, stablecoins were the place to be.  Among cryptocurrencies with over $10 billion in market cap, the top four performers during the month were all stablecoins: By simply holding their peg to the dollar, those digital assets avoided one of the worst-ever starts to the year in cryptocurrency markets, as bitcoin fell 17%.  Tether’s UST rose 0.02% during the month, Binance USD (BUSD) was unchanged, Circle’s USD Coin slipped 0.03%, and Terra USD (UST) slid 0.14%.  In other words, they held their value – the crypto equivalent of sitting in cash while the most popular crypto assets took big losses. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, tumbled 25%.  Many of the biggest crypto assets were coming off impressive rallies in the fourth quarter, as bitcoin rose to its all-time-high price of almost $69,000 in November. In a sign of how volatile cryptocurrencies are, bitcoin has fallen by over 40% since then and was recently changing hands at around $38,500.  In this market, the roughly flat return of major stablecoins versus the dollar might feel like upside.  “Stablecoins are used in volatile months to trade around volatility,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital “When markets were choppy, we flew to safety in the stablecoin, then went in and out around small price changes.”  Ulrik Lykke, director of Marlin & Spike, a boutique investment firm and consultancy specialized in crypto, noted that stablecoins also can be ""used as productive assets for generating attractive yield.”  Some of the recent interest in stablecoins might be tied to the strength of the U.S. dollar in global foreign-exchange markets.  Last week, the Federal Reserve hinted at three possible interest rate hikes starting in March, but economists are now expecting more than that, with Bank of America going as far as predicting seven quarter-percentage-point hikes this year from the current level around 0%.  Fed monetary tightening tends to make fixed-income assets in the U.S. more attractive, which in turn drives up the allure of the U.S. dollar compared with other major currencies.  With the Fed just beginning its campaign to thwart fast inflation, a strong dollar could persist throughout 2022, giving crypto traders more reason to park their funds in dollar-pegged stablecoins.  On the regulatory front, the U.S. House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee will hold a virtual hearing on Feb. 8 to discuss stablecoins, which could provide further guidance on how stablecoins will be regulated in the future.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/31/stablecoins-won-crypto-markets-in-january-with-0-returns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07fa052442e3dc0582243aed896b3cc39716b151-1500x1004.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, as time as gone by and more altcoins are beginning to gain popularity, bitcoin is losing its hold as the number 1 choice for investors. A recent survey that featured respondents from the ultra-wealthy class showed that they did not favor bitcoin as their first choice. Rather, they picked an altcoin whose growth has rivaled and even surpassed that of bitcoin since its inception. Ethereum Comes On Top Crypto.com revealed that the wealthy are gradually moving away from bitcoin. Their obvious choice besides the leading cryptocurrency is ethereum, which is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The numbers provided by the crypto exchange showed that ethereum has made its mark on the wealthy.

Registered participants in the 500-person race will have the 26.2 miles they run in real life tracked using their mobile phones or watches; that race data will correspond to an avatar progressing through Raramuri’s virtual course.  “With physical marathons, there are so many logistical boxes to check, and it’s not accessible for a lot of people,” Nam Do, chief technology officer of Raramuri, told CoinDesk in an interview. “To bring people together from around the world, who can all run in their hometowns, connected by our course, we think it’s a very special thing.”  Spectators can line the virtual course’s track and support their favorite runners by emoting a thumbs up or sending non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to their wallets as they sprint by.  Runners will feel a buzz on their phones when they pass a competitor and are encouraged to dress up their avatars in costumes to make the race more theatrical.  The back end of the project is built on the KardiaChain blockchain, in what the company is calling its first “run-to-earn” event.  Runners who complete the marathon will be rewarded with a digital asset to commemorate their experience, which will include their race time and grant early access to future marathon registrations.

Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), who introduced the provision, confirmed the agreement in a tweet, saying, “Thanks for working with us on this @jerrybrito Good outcome.”  A provision in the America COMPETES Act, a bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives last week, would have allowed the Treasury secretary to block or “impose conditions” on transactions, should the official find that the transaction or the accounts involved are engaged in money laundering. The overall bill is aimed at spurring economic competitiveness with China.  Coin Center warned in a blog post, however, that the bill could therefore allow the Treasury secretary to block all U.S. financial institutions from interacting with a crypto exchange, a jurisdiction that has crypto exchanges and crypto transactions validated by a non-U.S. miner or non-custodial wallets.  Under existing law, the Treasury secretary, in consultation with the Federal Reserve chairman, secretary of state, federal regulators and other agencies, has the power to impose such restrictions on transactions. However, a public rulemaking notice must be issued with the restriction, and the restriction lifts after 120 days unless the Treasury Department implements a rule continuing the block after the comment period.  The proposed provision would have removed the comment period and 120-day expiration, according to Coin Center, in addition to explicitly adding digital assets to the types of financial transactions that the Treasury secretary could restrict.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nelson Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/31/provision-in-house-bill-allowing-treasury-secretary-to-block-international-crypto-transactions-to-be-removed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/311ec413b87d9b0abb388e4741903d9d14b7d120-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394316,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbWQB,1643658202,"NFTs, Celebrities and Perverse Deal-Making","Early last week, a viral clip from “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” began making the rounds on social media. In it, Fallon’s guest, the socialite turned crypto promoter Paris Hilton, shows off a picture of one of her recent NFT purchases: a reddish Bored Ape complete with hat and sunglasses.  “It’s really cool,” Hilton drawls, as if reading from cue cards. “The hat. The shades.”  The affectless, openly promotional nature of the clip drew plenty of ire from media commentators over the course of the week. Vice called it “frankly, hallucinogenic,” while New York magazine likened it to a “crypto-Herbalife pitch,” in a nod to the infamous multilevel marketer and nutrition company. The moment even inspired a piece titled “NFTS Are, Quite Simply, Bulls**t,” from the left-wing magazine Jacobin.  And while the clip is indeed difficult to watch, the real culprit isn’t Fallon or Hilton, but MoonPay, the crypto custodian and payments processor whose marketing strategy hinges on these sorts of celebrity endorsements. The company planted a promotion in a recent music video for a Post Malone song with The Weeknd, and has acted as a “concierge” for NFT purchases on behalf of Snoop Dogg, Gunna, Meek Mill, Lil Baby, Gwyneth Paltrow, Diplo and Kevin Hart.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Its message is simple: Dealing with Ethereum, self-hosted wallets, seed phrases and NFT marketplaces is a hassle. MoonPay agrees to handle all the tech stuff, shepherding pricey NFTs into the hands of non-crypto celebrities. On its website, MoonPay targets the paid service toward “high net worth individuals.”  While there's nothing inherently wrong with helping celebrities get into crypto (and potentially having them boast about your services on late-night talk shows and social media), MoonPay hasn't been exactly forthcoming about its financial relationships. It hasn't disclosed whether it’s paying for advertisements or asking people to post about its app in exchange for a service, leaving the question open as to whether this is a quid pro quo.  There’s a long history of fly-by-night fintech companies using celebrities to promote crypto. A rising tide lifts all boats, goes the thinking: If celebrities get the public on board, the industry expands and bag holders get richer. Creating the illusion of an NFT gold rush inevitably inspires FOMO (the fear of missing out).  But because MoonPay may or may not be paying for straightforward promotions and advertisements, it’s unclear whether celebrity enthusiasm for NFTs is genuine.  In an interview with The Block, MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright deflected a question as to who approaches whom, describing the company’s outreach process as “100% organic,” the kind of thing that just happened to spring out of conversations with celebrities “who are all excited about the promise of NFTs to transform the way digital rights, intellectual property and fan relationships are managed.”  Other crypto investors are following a similar playbook.  When another Bored Ape sold for 500 ETH this past weekend (that’s $1.3 million – well over the current “floor” price of around 116 ETH), some speculated Justin Bieber was behind it. Bieber fanned the flames by posting a picture of the NFT on his official Instagram page but said nothing about actually making the purchase.  A quick look at the Ethereum wallet associated with the million-dollar ape (it’s tied to an unverified account on OpenSea called JustinBieberNFTs) shows that two days ago, another wallet sent it over 900 ETH.  See also: Kim Kardashian and Ethereum Max. Why? | David Z. Morris  That other address appears to be associated with Gianpiero D’Alessandro – the creator of an NFT project called InBetweeners, which Bieber has already been promoting for weeks on Twitter and Instagram. The address is linked to D’Alessandro’s verified account on OpenSea.  Just after the ape sold, the InBetweeners Twitter account began gloating about how the (maybe) Bieber-owned NFT was inflating the price of InBetweeners NFTs.  Celebrities may genuinely want to invest in these assets, or think they’re joining a movement, but they’re also increasingly the targets of marketers with other agendas.  Still, for a price, they’ll gladly sell you the moon.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/31/nfts-celebrities-and-perverse-deal-making,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65d6664eee2cdec91b74323dba2c9712e7f939e8-1988x1054.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the increase looks small relative to some of the $200 million-plus weeks of inflows in 2021, the trend suggests investors are cautiously adding to positions ""at these depressed price levels,"" the CoinShares analysts wrote.

The CCI was formed last April by founding members from Block, Coinbase, Fidelity Digital Assets and Paradigm, and it includes Andreessen Horowitz as a board member.  Prior to joining the CCI, Warren worked as a senior executive at TechSoup, where she built NGOsource, an initiative funded by the Gates and Hewlett foundations.

42423794,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gerh,1643655765,"Ethereum Suffers Worst Month in Nearly 2 Years, SOL Falls Even Harder","Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, has suffered its biggest monthly price decline since March 2020, tumbling alongside bitcoin in one of worst-ever starts to a year in cryptocurrency markets.  Ether is down 31% in January, while bitcoin (BTC) has fallen 22%.  The sell-off also claimed some of the hottest tokens from 2021, in several cases vaporizing half of their market value, or more. Terra’s LUNA has declined 50% in January, while Solana’s SOL has dropped 49% and Avalanche’s AVAX has lost 42%.  Bitcoin's dominance ratio – its share of the overall crypto market capitalization – is sitting at about 42%, having dipped below 39% mid-January, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Corinthian Digital. This time last year, bitcoin's dominance was at 62%.  The numbers suggest that the past year's rapid run-up in altcoin relative valuations has reversed recently amid the broader sell-off in crypto markets; the highest flyers have suffered the biggest comedowns.  Ethereum also continued to surrender its lead in decentralized finance (DeFi), where its dominance is at around 59%, according to data from defillama. The smart-contract blockchain's prowess in DeFi slipped earlier this month to an all-time low of 57%.  “This points to strong risk appetite, as opposed to capital flight away from riskier assets,” said Vinokourov.  It’s become evident that the macroeconomic forces that helped to fuel crypto’s bull run previously are turning in the opposite direction, creating uncertainty. Those include the Federal Reserve's pivot toward hawkish monetary policies – with tighter financial conditions designed to attack inflation – from a previously dovish stance of keeping borrowing costs low to stoke growth.  “This has led to the highest correlations between crypto and traditional markets since March 2020,” said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock. ""By accelerating interest rate hikes and likely beginning quantitative tightening, the Federal Reserve is disincentivizing investment in order to manage inflation.”  According to Outumuro, the outlook ""seems priced in now.""  ""There is also potential upside surprise in the case that the Fed moves slower than expected,” he said.  Altcoins are unlikely to pick up until the bitcoin market turns positive, says Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds. “Any action would likely begin with BTC or even ETH,” he said.  Neo doesn't see the current downward action as a long-term issue, but rather says that markets are still in a phase of sideways trading and price discovery, with the inflation picture uncertain and interest rates set to rise.  All members of the CoinDesk 20 digital assets are in the red for the month. Filecoin (FIL) was down 44%, and Polygon’s MATIC lost 38%.

When the value of this indicator is positive, it means long holders are currently dominant and are paying a premium to short traders. Such values occur when the market sentiment is majorly bullish.

42394322,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbWpp,1643654745,The Financialization of Fandom,"I have a friend who never shuts up about attending a Lana Del Rey show in Seattle back in circa 2007, and rightly so. After I began listening to Lana a few years later, he would constantly remind me that he discovered her before anyone else. Again, rightly so. It’s a shame for my friend that, other than a pat on the back, he can’t really capture value from early artist discovery.  Until now.  Aziz Alangari is a marketing associate at Wachsman, a PR firm.  Let’s say that in 2007, Lana had her own creator token. We’ll use $LANA as the hypothetical ticker here, if blockchain technology was present at the time and $LANA was listed on a creator platform like Rally. My friend’s investment in $LANA would be the determining factor of being a true early Lana fan. Having skin in the game and investing financially in the artist would be the determining factor of fandom, not attendance at a concert.  If he only attended the show without investing in $LANA, then it would speak less about him being an early fan. But if he did in fact put some money on it, then it is documented on the blockchain, immutably, that he was in fact an early fan.  The financialization of early artist discovery is neglected even though it does possess some level of value, but that value isn’t captured as of yet. The cathartic feeling of knowing something before it becomes cool or mainstream, regardless of how annoying it can be, is in fact valuable to some degree. Whether we like it or not.  This is not exclusive to musicians. Creator tokens can be used for all content creators.  I listen to a podcast called Red Scare and pay $5 a month for it on Patreon, which to my knowledge is split equitably between the creators (podcast hosts) and the platform (Patreon). The 12,000-plus subscribers have zero ownership despite having a significant impact in the podcast’s growth through engagements, social media posts and, of course, their monthly monetary investments.  It really sucks because fans are arguably more favorable to creators than to the platforms they use for publishing. No one likes a middleman. I can’t think of any musician who spoke highly of their record label, or a social media influencer who explicitly talks about how great Instagram is. If they do, they’re likely new to fame and are blinded by the money, but the reality is that removing the middleman is the best-case scenario for both creators and fans.  So if Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova, the lovely contrarian Russian hosts of ""Red Scare,"" had their own social tokens or NFT (non-fungible token) collections with customized utility, they would then be able to give their listeners an opportunity to own a fraction of their fame. As ""Red Scare"" grows and the hosts become more notable, so do their fans’ investments in them. Dasha got casted on season three of “Succession,” which followed with more podcast subscriptions and Instagram followers; but that doesn't translate in value for fans.  Incentive for Creators  What’s in it for the creators, you ask? They would be making more money, have the ability to engage directly with their fans and capitalize more on their content without being afraid of censorship. I repeat: No one likes a middleman. This is particularly relevant for the politically incorrect, contrarian ""Red Scare"" girls. (I recommend their NFT episode, wherein Dean Kissick refers to NFT marketplaces as “Etsy for men.”)  Read more: Jeff Wilser - The Social (Token) Network: Rally, Friends With Benefits and the Future of Branding  It’s crazy to me how creator tokens seem novel to crypto natives. I was on a call with Antonio Juliano of the dYdX decentralized exchange, where he asked me to “teach him something.” I told the story about how my friend wouldn’t shut up about Lana Del Rey, and that social tokens may be the solution for creating ""Proof of Fandom"" or ""Proof of Experience."" It seems that crypto folks are trying to create mass adoption to DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols and decentralized exchanges when the “masses” of our society are not financially literate, and will likely never care about Bitcoin derivatives. The masses understand music and reality television. There’s a place in crypto for that.  The reason social tokens are friendlier than other crypto concepts is because they have a direct tie to reality. Artists can simply list their token-backed digital merch and ask their fans to make a purchase, which they will. In theory, it is more difficult to get the average person to invest in a random Solana liquidity pool than to buy their favorite artist’s social token. The latter, while still being an entirely novel concept, does create a comforting tie and a friendly gateway into Web 3. The former is arguably more lucrative, albeit so complicated to grasp that it becomes a hurdle for the masses to join in.  I know that everyone in Web 3 is excited about the space and hopeful that mainstream adoption will happen sooner rather than later, but the reality is that Web 3 is just too boring for mainstream adoption. The crypto community isn’t funny enough. The memes feel like inside jokes. Social tokens are important because they instantly add a level of intrigue and excitement without fans’ knowledge of their ability to own parts of their artist’s notoriety and fame.  The financialization of creators and putting a numeric value on a feeling can seem very dystopian and weird, but also inevitable. I want to invest in people I like and believe in. To my friend who knew Lana before everyone else, I love you, but your experience is worth nothing unless it’s documented on the blockchain and backed by a token.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | SOL | TRADING,Aziz Alangari,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/31/the-financialization-of-fandom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/823314f31efb62cb4b5e4acf2dd30fa7082a6bf0-4070x2708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

By inherent design, the data on the blockchain cannot be modified or hacked which makes it a legitimate technology to be used for industries such as cybersecurity, payments, healthcare, and more. Each transaction is recorded on something called blocks in several databases, or the &apos;chain,&apos; in a network connected by peer-to-peer nodules. Every transaction in the digital ledger is authorized by the owner&apos;s digital signature, which authenticates the transaction and protects it from meddling. As a result, the data stored in the digital ledger is exceptionally protected. In simpler terms, the digital ledger is similar to a specific computer program that is shared across many computers in a network and stores transactional records that support actual purchases. The intriguing aspect is that everyone can see the data, but they can&apos;t change it.

42393981,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQNMH,1643650183,'We're Freaking DAOing It': The People Who Think DAOs Are the Future of Work,"“This is the best day ever,” Willy Ogorzaly says with a grin. And he’ll tell you the same thing tomorrow. He’ll tell you that next week. This is because every day for the past five years, in what has now become a ritual, Ogorzaly cheerfully says out loud, “This is the best day ever!”  Here’s how Ogorzaly’s best day ever begins: He wakes up in time for a 7 a.m. meeting. By then his phone has over 100 Direct Messages, mostly in Discord. He’ll be glued to screens for the next 12 hours. He’ll take a break to cook dinner with his girlfriend, but when she goes to bed he’ll do more work. “I don’t have a great work-life balance,” Ogorzaly says, “but fortunately I love what I do.”  Why is Ogorzaly so damned chipper? Because he’s working at a DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, and this makes him euphoric. He actually works at two DAOs – ShapeShift (the decentralized exchange) and Giveth (a decentralized philanthropic group). Six months ago I spoke to Ogorzaly when ShapeShift transformed itself from a company into a DAO. Back then Ogorzaly pushed for the change and he predicted it would work. Now? He feels vindicated. “It’s working. It’s working, man,” he says with another big smile. “We’re moving faster as a DAO than ShapeShift has ever moved.” Then he adds another catchphrase: “We’re freaking DAOing it.”  Read More: What Is a DAO?  More and more people are DAOing it, and Ogorzaly believes DAOs are the future of work. He’s far from alone. The DAOers say the new structure is empowering, invigorating and a natural fit for our fluid work-from-home schedules. “It feels so much more collaborative. There’s a unified sense of purpose,” says Patti Hauseman, who left a career in the music industry to become the head of operations at Friends with Benefits, a prominent social and networking DAO. All of her colleagues seem to actually care about what they’re doing, says Hauseman, and it reminds her of those rare moments in the music industry “where you connect with an artist.”  Here's the lure: DAOs take the most intoxicating parts of startup culture – the rush of adrenaline, the faith in your company’s vision, the joy of the work itself and, yes, the chance to get rich – and then extends that buzz to the entire organization. Everyone gets to feel like a CEO. Everyone gets to feel like a founder. “In the traditional organization you have three or five founders who own the bulk of the company, and then a few investors who own the other bulk,” says Juan Dulanto, operations lead at PleasrDAO. “Whereas with DAOs … it really is community-owned from day one. It’s just refreshing.”  In a traditional company, it’s easy to feel like a cog in the machine. It’s easy to feel like your work is pointless or the bureaucracy is dumb or your brilliant ideas are ignored by a clueless boss. In a DAO? In theory, your merit will be rewarded and you can work on whatever you find interesting.  Rafa, aka “rafathebuilder” on Twitter, and the DAO lead at Mirror DAO, tries to explain this to me by grounding it in the personal.  “Do you like writing?” Rafa asks me over Zoom.  “Kind of?” I say, avoiding for a moment the existential dread that this question brings all writers.  “If you weren’t getting paid, would you still write?”  “Um … Probably?”  He explains that because I enjoy writing (kind of), I would be able to find opportunities to create within a DAO – adding value to the community and then being compensated for my work. Maybe I would find a blog that needs content. Or if that doesn’t exist, perhaps I would suggest the DAO creates a blog and then maybe that blog would generate ads and revenue that’s shared by all. That’s the heartbeat of a DAO: Creators have a way to collaborate, coordinate and monetize their creations.  “People are self-organizing into groups of things that they want to do,” says Rafa. “People have realized, 'Oh shoot, I can just do interesting work, and people give me money?'” Before helping to launch Mirror DAO (a Web 3 publishing platform), Rafa studied organizational behavior for years. He came to the conclusion that most of the bureaucracy, waste and bloated tiers of management in corporations exist for a simple reason: Companies were stuck trying to get people to do work they didn’t really want to do. That’s why we have bosses and deadlines. Whereas at DAOs, contributors “like doing work and like doing cool stuff,” says Rafa. “And it turns out that you can create value online by creating cool stuff, because people recognize quality and will give you money for it.”  So what does this mean, pragmatically?  At DAOs, there are many different ways to “create cool stuff” and then get money for it. That’s part of the pitch. At PleasrDAO (a DAO that collects and then fractionalizes digital art, allowing for collective ownership), you can work as a full-time contributor, a part-time contributor or you can just knock out some one-off tasks. These different tiers of contribution are “one of the major strengths of DAOs,” allowing people to contribute whenever they have the time and bandwidth, says Dulanto.  Dulanto gives a theoretical example: “One of our projects for the DAO is to launch XYZ Project in Q1 of this year, and we’re going to need someone to build a website.” So Pleasr would set up a “bounty” for the DAO. As Dulanto explains it, this means, “Hey, this is a one-time need that we have. It’s a bounty. We need X website built out with Y scope. And this is what we’re willing to pay.” The bounty is then open to all PleasrDAO members, or even “to people who are not yet members.”  Organizing a DAO  DAOs are often thought of as “flat” organizational hierarchies. But that’s not entirely true and they often have structure. ShapeShift, for example, has six different “Work Streams,” such as Product and Partnerships. (You can view the org chart here.) These can be thought of as divisions in a corporation. Each Work Stream then breaks down into “squads” and contributors. So the head of a Work Stream is analogous to a vice president; squad leaders are de facto bosses.  However, buttoned-up words like “vice president” and “bosses” are anathema to the vibe of DAOs. “I don’t feel like anybody’s really a boss,” says FWB's Hauseman. “Everybody’s sort of working collectively together.” In a structure similar to ShapeShift, FWB splits the organization into six “teams” such as Editorial, Product and Membership. The teams do normal business-type things like have meetings and issue deadlines.  In other words, it’s not a free-for-all. “It’s not necessarily throwing out every old playbook, or that there’s not hierarchy or accountability,” says Nicole d'Avis, a core team member at Seed Club, a DAO that’s an accelerator for Web 3 projects. She says her DAO is “bringing over only the pieces that make sense.”  He skipped so many meals that he began intermittent fasting by accident, and later he was so stoked to hear that this was actually healthy.  Dulanto is doing the same thing at PleasrDAO. “We still need to organize and collaborate with people, and figure out how to allocate resources,” says Dulanto, who conducts regular weekly calls to keep the team in synch. “I’m a big believer that organizations really need a cadence and a healthy rhythm to operate well.”  That’s one reason why every Wednesday, at noon, Ogorzaly facilitates a lunch for the entire ShapeShift community. ""Anyone can hop in at the ShapeShift Discord,"" says Ogorzaly. ""It’s a decentralized 'ask anyone anything' lunch."" Eating lunch is a bit of an anomaly for Ogorzaly, who is usually so swamped with work that he skips meals. Even when it’s the best day ever. Ogorzaly skipped so many meals that he began intermittent fasting by accident, and later he was “so stoked to hear that this was actually healthy.”  Rat-feeding games  DAOs are a curious blend of socialism and hyper-capitalism. Socialism, because they’re essentially “employee-owned” like a co-op. Capitalism, because in the incentive-based mechanisms of the free market structure within the DAO, contributors bid on projects (like the website bounty example) and merit is rewarded.  Blockchain technology gives DAOs their rocket fuel, but the roots go back to the 19th century. “The main philosophy has been at work since the emergence of Robert Owen’s ideas about cooperatives,” says Koray Caliskan, associate professor of Strategic Design and Management at the Parsons School of Design, a college of New York's New School, who has studied crypto for years. Caliskan, who’s based in Brooklyn, N.Y., jokes that if he wanted to go to a real DAO he can walk down the street and head to the Park Slope Food Coop.  Caliskan also jokes that “DAOs are not decentralized, they’re not autonomous and they’re not organizations.” But he’s not really joking. He argues that DAOs are not decentralized because they’re often controlled by a small group of people who control most of the tokens; they’re not autonomous because they’re “created by human actors, with certain interests and with politics embedded in it;” and they’re not even organizations because the DAO is a technological “instrument,” or a means of infrastructure, as opposed to the actual organization of people. (This recalls Voltaire’s quip that the Holy Roman Empire was “neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire.”)  Semantics aside, Caliskan believes that while DAOs might not be revolutionary, they are also “fantastic, of course” and that “preliminary research suggests they [DAO contributors] enjoy being actors, equal actors, and having a say on economic matters of concern.” But he adds two notes of caution. First, it’s hard to untangle the appeal of a DAO from the lure of price speculation. (Maybe you just hope your DAO’s token goes “to the moon.”)  Second, we don’t know if workers’ appreciation of DAOs are correlation or causation; it’s possible the DAO enthusiasts are simply jazzed about their projects and maybe they’d be loving the work no matter the organizational structure. Ogorzaly is a counter-argument to this counter-argument. He worked at ShapeShift when it was a traditional company and now as a DAO. He’s all about “DAO Life” – even if it’s starving him.  Ogorzaly clearly loves what he does, but the DAO’s tendency to erode our free time is a concern of Quinn Dupont, an assistant professor at the University College Dublin, who has studied both organization behavior and crypto. An implicit risk of DAO work, says Dupont, is a “deep financialization of the everyday.”  Because DAOs are structured with financial and incentive-based mechanisms, it’s possible that we will increasingly use our free time to press a lever that brings us money. “I really, truly believe that much of what crypto-economics amounts to are behavioral technologies, in the sense that BF Skinner talked about in the 1950s.” Skinner is the psychologist who developed a theory of “operant conditioning,” or, as Dupont explains it, “Humans are placed into rat-feeder games.” (This doesn’t mean Dupont is anti-DAO. In fact, he’s actually leaving University College Dublin to launch a DAO of his own, Alumni, with the goal of putting university diplomas on the blockchain.)  Part of a long-term trend  DAOs have some obvious downsides. Let’s start with that quaint old concept from the world of traditional jobs called a “salary.” These are rare (but not unheard of) at DAOs. Job security looks and feels different.  Often you’re paid on a project-to-project basis, meaning you’re not entirely sure how much money, if any, you’ll make in the future. Maybe you win the “bounty” to create the website for PleasrDAO in Dulanto’s example, but then what’s next? Or at ShapeShift, most of the Work Streams are only funded for six months. This gives you only six months of job security. “That’s not bad in the startup space,” says Ogorzaly with his customary good cheer, but he acknowledges that it does take a leap of faith and that “If you can’t handle uncertainty, you’re not going to have a great time in the DAO.”  Then again, is that any worse than the current uncertainty for most freelancers in the gig economy? “Job security is not something that a Web 2 company, or the traditional work world, is great at either,” says d'Avis. She says that given all of the work that needs to be done in building Web 3, “the power dynamic is much more in the other direction.” The workers have the power. There aren’t enough skilled developers, designers and community managers to go around. “I don’t know that anyone who’s working hard and providing value is worried about job security,” says d’Avis. “Right now, job security is not that hot of a topic.” (Counterargument: On Jan. 24, the token holders of MakerDAO, in a narrow 49% to 47% decision, voted to shutter one of its core teams, effectively putting people out of work. Democracies can be fickle.)  Or maybe we should zoom out and think about jobs with a wider lens. “Job security is going to be defined differently as society evolves,” says Hauseman at FWB. She notes that decades ago, our parents and grandparents worked at the same company for 20 to 30 years. A generation later, “five to eight years” was considered a long time to work at a company. So extrapolating this trend, Hauseman doesn’t see the short-term horizons of DAO work as a sudden collapse of job security but the continuation of a much broader trend – the fractionalization of employment.  Maybe this is true. But it also seems true that this kind of “leap of faith,” as Ogorzaly calls it, probably isn’t as doable for those with less of a financial cushion, or those in tough economic circumstances. “Early on,” says Dulanto, “it has only really been an industry [for] people who have the fortune and privilege to take big risks.” He acknowledges that “for people who have a family, or have different needs in regards to job security, this hasn’t been the easiest option.” He views this as something the industry needs to work on.  And what about the other perks of normal jobs, like health care? Vacation days? Even 401(k)s? “To be completely honest with you, we’ve been trying to figure it out,” says Dulanto, at PleasrDAO. “We’re [figuratively] building the road in front of us as we’re walking.” But he knows this is important. Dulanto says that if Web 3 organizations truly want to attract and keep top talent, “We have to be paying better than an early-stage, venture-backed startup.” Hauseman thinks that providing benefits is a matter of principle. “Speaking just on behalf of myself,” says Hauseman, “I feel very strongly that the future of Web 3 is not Uber at scale.”  Then there’s still the tricky question of “work-life balance,” and Dupont’s concern about the rat-feeder games. With DAOs, it seems the work is the life. “Anecdotally, I would say that most people that work in these digital communities are working longer hours than in traditional employment,” says Rafa. When you plunge into a DAO, you’re signing up for a gushing fire hydrant of Discord DMs that blasts you all day and all night and most weekends and holidays. “There’s just always something that has to get done at a DAO because we’re so early,” says Hauseman, which makes it easy to slip into a pattern of constantly being “on.” Hauseman tries to end her workday at 6 p.m. but often it goes till 8 p.m. She’s now trying to be “more protective of downtime.”  If you want to start at 9 a.m. and check out at 5 p.m., then you might have more fun at a bank startup.  D’Avis agrees that work-life balance can be a struggle, but says that’s true of any startup, and that it’s up to the person to find the right balance. She usually logs off on weekends. But given the global and 24/7 nature of crypto, she has found that “there are certainly people with funny avatars showing up in your DMs at all times.”  Another DAO limitation: A good chunk of the population isn’t really “passionate” about their work or what they do; they just want to punch the clock and collect a paycheck. DAO enthusiasts might argue that these poor rubes simply haven’t yet melded their true burning passion to the needs of an organization, and the DAO could be their answer.  Maybe. But I wouldn’t underestimate the population of cube-dwellers who toil away in Excel and log out at 5 p.m., eager to hit Happy Hour and forget about work. “DAO Life isn’t a fit for everybody,” says Ogorzaly. “If you really need a lot of structure and organization, and if you want a boss telling you what to do, and if you want to start at 9 a.m. and check out at 5 p.m., then you might have more fun at a bank startup.”  So could DAOs actually be the future of work? “It can’t,” says Caliskan. “We cannot eat bytes. We eat bread. We still need to eat. We still need houses. We still need to produce things on the ground.” This is hard to argue. Even the most bullish champions of DAOs acknowledge that the scope is largely in the creative and digital realm, not factories or hamburger stands.  Then again, consider the size and scale of the “gig economy.” This is no longer a fringe group. An estimated 55 million people in the United States are classified as gig workers, a scattered population that has little ability to organize, to collaborate or to exert leverage. Each of these 55 million workers feels powerless against the machine. United, they could be an army. While it’s true that many of these gigs are driving an Uber, delivering Postmates or walking dogs – not exactly “DAO-able” digital jobs – it’s also true that the status quo is rather bleak.  It’s a hustle to get new clients. You never know if you’ll be paid next month. You feel alone. So while I’m skeptical that DAOs will topple Corporate America or revolutionize the workplace, in theory, if things break right, I could see them improving the pay, career prospects, camaraderie and job satisfaction of millions of freelancers. That would not be a small thing. For millions of coders and artists and graphic designers and project managers, that could even lead to the best day ever.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/31/were-freaking-daoing-it-the-people-who-think-daos-are-the-future-of-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58a2886e8dd93743afc9f23ef05c0c01e10ebe86-2388x1668.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423790,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gefh,1643648458,Arcade Launches NFT Lending Platform as Blue Chips Hold Strong,"Lending platform Arcade has launched on Pawn Protocol in a bid to bring liquidity to the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the company announced Monday.  The platform is a peer-to-peer marketplace that allows users to access fixed-rate loans collateralized by their Ethereum-based NFTs, using an escrow system.  Arcade says it has more than $15 million locked up in blue chip NFTs and $6 million in loan volume, with average loans of about $350,000, a representative told CoinDesk. (Blue-chip NFTs are considered to be those among the highest valued in the market, like Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks or Doodles.)  The launch comes just a month after Arcade announced a $15 million Series A funding round in December that was led by Pantera Capital.  “Right now, most of the value is locked up in the top 1% of assets, so the platform is curated to certain collections,” Arcade CEO Gabe Frank told CoinDesk in an interview. “Once we start integrating layer 2s and other blockchains, we can get into some of the lower value assets. Just because of gas costs, it’s currently quite restricted and only makes sense for these higher value loans.”  NFT resilience  Arcade’s launch comes at a time when confidence in blue chip NFT projects has never been higher. Despite an overall market downturn in recent weeks, the floor price for projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club have soared to all-time-highs, with record sales volume on the popular marketplace OpenSea in January.  Frank said he sees the future of the NFT lending market extending beyond just profile pictures – the platform has seen a growing interest in collateralized loans for metaverse assets on games like The Sandbox, and it recently issued a loan, funded by Neon DAO, against 48 plots of the game's virtual land.

Stakeholders in the crypto space like Cathie Wood have expressed that they believed the digital asset could make the half a million-dollar point. Naturally, they do not expect this to happen in one or two years but do believe that it is an inevitable end for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Anthony Scaramucci, the famed CEO of SkyBridge Capital, has revealed that he, too, shares this forecast for the cryptocurrency. Scaramucci gives his reasons and timeline for this in a recent interview with Kitco News. Bitcoin Headed To $500K Scaramucci shared with Kitco News that he sees the price of bitcoin hitting the $500,000 mark. Basically, the reason for this falls on the adoption trend of the digital asset. This trend has been compared to that of the internet in the &apos;90s, which saw accelerated growth triggered in the next decade. BTC has been on a more accelerated timeline, so the next five years would spell exponential growth if it sticks to its current trend.

Earned income on crypto trading or mining can be reported as capital gains on income taxes, tax officials said on Monday, according to a Financial Times report. The new rules would allow traders to offset their losses against gains made in the same year.  Thailand's Revenue Department previously had plans to strengthen its oversight of cryptocurrency trading following significant growth in the size and value of the market in 2021.  However, stakeholders in the crypto industry issued warnings that excessive taxation could kill off potential growth in the sector.  Thailand's financial authorities last week announced plans to regulate the use of digital assets as a method of payment. The Bank of Thailand, Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission said they will issue guidelines for certain digital assets that support the financial system without posing any systemic risk.

42394561,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBkH9,1643643545,How to Stake Cardano (ADA),"Staking is a process where token holders deposit – or lock away – a number of tokens to become active participants in running the network. More specifically, they become “validators” (also known as “stakers”) whose role is to propose and verify new data that’s added to the blockchain.  People are chosen at random to add new data to the blockchain, and those that are selected receive rewards for doing so. To reduce the number of people spamming the network, those who lock away more coins have a higher chance of being selected. You can think of it as a lottery system, where one ADA essentially equals one lottery ticket. The more ADA you stake, the greater your odds of being selected.  Cardano makes staking easy through delegation  With Cardano, individuals can hand over the responsibility of staking to entities called “stake pool operators.” As the name suggests, people who join these have their tokens pooled together. The pools are usually run by individuals or groups of people who have the specialist knowledge and hardware necessary to perform staking on the network – though anyone can become their own staking pool operator. Users have complete freedom to choose which pool they’d like to join, and can review each one based on their previous performance, uptime and size of pool.  Once a person chooses a pool to stake their tokens with, they must enter them into the pool in a process called ""delegating."" Coins can be unstaked and re-staked as many times and with as many pools as you like. You just have to wait for the next epoch to pass before your assets are relocated.  Cardano divides time into divisions called “epochs” where each epoch consists of 432,000 one-second intervals called “slots.” This means each epoch typically lasts for five days.  At the end of each epoch, a snapshot is created. Snapshots record the distribution of staked ADA to pool participants and use it to calculate what rewards are owed to each person.  This means that when rewards enter your wallet, you are actually being rewarded for staking that took place a few epochs back. Therefore, it may take some time for you to see your first rewards, and other times you can receive rewards after your tokens have been unstaked (taken out of the pool).  You will earn a percentage of the coin you have delegated, not a percentage of the U.S. dollar value of that coin. The dollar value of ADA may change while you are staking it.  What makes crypto staking possible?  Staking on Cardano is possible because its blockchain uses the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This refers to the system the blockchain uses to ensure all network participants act honestly and in the best interest of the network.  You have to remember, anyone can participate in a blockchain network worldwide, and no central authority is in place to make sure people follow the rules. Consensus mechanisms like proof-of-stake are coded into the blockchain and decide who is selected to do the important task of adding new data, like transaction data, to the blockchain.  You can think of each consensus mechanism as its own type of selection test designed to choose honest, worthy participants.  Bitcoin uses a different consensus mechanism called proof-of-work (PoW), which uses miners instead of stakers to check and add new data to the blockchain. Miners have to compete with one another using energy-intensive computers to generate a winning code before anyone else in order to be selected to validate transitions and discover new blocks. Not only is this system bad for the environment, but it also involves a much high barrier for entry. With proof-of-stake, the hardware requirements are far lower meaning more people can participate and energy consumption levels are low.  How to begin staking ADA  There’s a choice of two different digital wallets you can download to store and start staking your ADA tokens:  Daedalus  Yoroi  Daedalus is a wallet that can be downloaded onto your desktop computer and is aimed at more intermediate-level users. The Yoroi wallet is a much more suitable option for beginners that, when downloaded, sits in your web browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Irrespective of which wallet you download, the staking process is similar for both.  Let’s look at the Yoroi wallet as an example. Once you have signed up and installed the Yoroi software, click the browser extension to go to your Yoroi dashboard and find the ""delegation list"" tab.  Here, you will see a list of stake pools along with key information such as:  ROA: Return of ADA. This is your interest rate.  Share/Pool Size: How much ADA is in the pool as well as how close to full capacity it is.  Costs: The costs are divided into a tax percentage you'll be charged and a fixed rate the entire pool will be charged.  Pledge: This shows how much of their own money the pool operators have delegated in their own pool.  Blocks: This shows how many blocks have been minted in the history of the pool.  Take your time researching staking pools. You can do this by heading over to ADAPools.org for a more in-depth look at the pools.  Once you have found where you wish to delegate your ADA, simply click the delegate button. You'll then have to enter your spending password that you created when setting up your wallet and agree to the fees.  Now all you have to do is wait for the transaction to complete. This usually takes between a few seconds to a couple of minutes. Once it’s confirmed, your assets will be staked in the pool.  How profitable is staking ADA?  Investing $1,000 in Cardano’s native token will get you 1,030 ADA, at press time. According to Cardano staking calculators, staking this amount over the course of the year could roughly net you between 46.31 to 59.63 ADA, or between 0.63 to 0.82 ADA per epoch.  Of course, this depends on a number of variables including each individual staking pool’s fees, how many participants there are in the pool and how many blocks are successfully proposed by the pool.  Risks associated with staking on Cardano  As with all types of investing, there are always risks involved. The first and most obvious risk associated with staking any crypto asset is the token plummeting to zero.  More specific risks include fluctuating interest rates. Pools that are nearer full capacity will have a lower interest rate than those with fewer participants. That’s because in a larger pool there are more people to spread the rewards between.  Another issue with staking is that you cannot use the delegated ADA while it’s locked up, though it can be moved at any time.  Some centralized exchanges such as Binance allow staking via their platform but require tokens to be locked up for a defined period – 30, 60 or 90 days.  Finally, staking pools include fees. Currently, the top pool, Goat Stake, will charge a 2.5% tax on rewards earned. You will also be affected by the fixed cost that is applied to all Cardano pools once a pool produces a block. Currently, the fixed cost is 340 ADA and will be applied to the whole pool, not just your delegated tokens.",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | REGULATION | BNB,Ryan S.

42423788,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2geZh,1643639396,Solana Wallet Phantom Raises $109M to Rival MetaMask,"The company building Solana’s top crypto wallet is now worth $1.2 billion, Phantom announced Monday.  Crypto venture firm Paradigm led a $109 million Series B investment in Phantom, CEO Brandon Millman said. It was not immediately clear who else joined the cap table, or what percentage equity they took in the upstart firm, whose main product is a Chromium browser plugin.  The wallet is going mobile, too: On Monday, the company debuted its iOS app. Millman expects his 20-odd team to ship an Android offering later this year, following through on a mission to get Solana’s most widely used crypto wallet in people’s pockets.  Phantom’s popular non-custodial service has become near-critical infrastructure for Solana-based decentralized finance; Millman claimed to command “at least 90%” market share. (CoinDesk could not independently verify this figure.)  It’s managed to do so in a rather unorthodox way. In an industry marked by open-source philosophies, Phantom, a private company, keeps wallet code under wraps. Even as its competitor wallets let their doors swing open, Phantom’s remain shut.  Read more: Coinbase Close to Listing Solana Ecosystem Tokens: Sources  Millman said Phantom “definitely has aspirations” to go open-source but “it has been difficult to prioritize.” It hasn’t yet due to a mix of operational, practical and competitive considerations, he said. Once that “Pandora’s box” is open it will be impossible to go back.  “Once it's open-source, there’s this implicit expectation around responding to people who are leaving issues on the GitHub repo, people who are submitting pull requests, wanting to get features into the wallet,” he said. “We don’t want to start doing those things quite yet.”  Plus, he said, the 2 million monthly active users don’t seem overly bothered by Phantom’s closed-source code.  But influential forces in Solana are irked. One analyst at a prominent venture capital firm said he continues to use Phantom only because there’s no better option. He pledged to abandon Phantom as soon as a “decent” open-source alternate comes along.  Being “better than” is precisely how Phantom grew its unicorn horn. Millman and his Ethereum-native co-founders built Phantom to be better than MetaMask, the popular wallet owned by ConsenSys.  That plan shifted when Phantom settled on Solana, where MetaMask, an EVM-compatible wallet, does not play. But the sentiment remained a driving force behind Phantom’s development.  “We originally were trying to move toward that multi-chain division last year, but chose to double down on Solana because of all the growth that we were seeing, “ Millman said, noting “we’re carefully considering the move to the EVM ecosystem sort of this year.”  Read more: Solana Wallet Phantom Nixes Auction for iOS Beta Invites After Community Erupts  Millman said Series B investors bought into Phantom’s multi-chain ambitions. They also signed on before the crypto market’s 2022 dip.  Phantom already has the cash in hand and plans to go on a hiring spree as its wallet ambitions grow. Millman, who was an Ethereum developer for years before he got rusty, said he knew what it’s like to code through a bear market. Having a cash stash certainly helps.  “We just want to lock in the money to make sure that we were protected in a downturn as well,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/31/solana-wallet-phantom-raises-109m-to-rival-metamask,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1850187aba8a3d14f243107bd4906c887985649-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meta will join over two dozen other companies who, by joining COPA, have pledged not to enforce their “core cryptocurrency patents” – broadly defined by Max Sills, the general manager of COPA as any “technology that enables the creation, mining, storage, transmission, settlement, integrity, or security of cryptocurrencies.”  The move comes as Meta winds down its Diem project, reportedly selling the project’s intellectual property to Silvergate Bank for $200 million to pay back investors.  By creating an alliance and requiring member companies to share their patents with COPA’s collective patent library, COPA’s goal is to encourage blockchain-related innovation by reducing the likelihood of patent litigation and, according to Dorsey, “help the crypto community defend against patent aggressors and trolls.”  In 2021, COPA filed a lawsuit against Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist best known for his widely debated claim to be the inventor of Bitcoin, over his attempts to copyright the Bitcoin white paper – an issue that has bedeviled the crypto community for years.  According to Sills, Meta is the largest patent holder that has joined COPA to date.  “It signifies that crypto is becoming a core technology to businesses across industries,” Sills wrote via email to CoinDesk.  When asked whether Diem’s patents would be included when Meta joined COPA, Sills said, “It includes all Meta’s core crypto technology patents in its portfolio.”  It is unclear if the arrangement will also extend to the Diem Association.  While Diem (then Libra) was spun up with a group of corporate backers, Meta also owns Novi, a digital wallet subsidiary launched as Calibra. Novi head David Marcus left the company earlier this month, though the wallet firm did launch a trial service with Paxos’ USDP stablecoin late last year.  Sills told CoinDesk that Meta committed to joining COPA in November 2021.

""We are opening a crypto exchange in Brazil because we have valuable assets there. We have released fan tokens of Brazil's national team and we have agreed with six other clubs,"" Altan Tan said.

42375386,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7dPd,1643632152,Bitcoin's Put-Call Ratio Hits 6-Month High as Negativity Rules,"The bitcoin (BTC) market appears plagued by negativity after the cryptocurrency lost half its value in 2 1/2 months.  The cryptocurrency's put-call open interest ratio, which measures the number of open positions in put options relative to those in calls, rose to a six-month high of 0.62 on Sunday, according to data provided by Skew. The ratio was 0.42 earlier this month.  ""The put-call ratio suggests demand for puts is currently high,"" said Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm. ""We have seen a lot of risk reversal flow recently, where clients were buying puts/selling calls.""  Traders execute a bearish risk reversal strategy by purchasing puts with lower strike prices and selling higher-strike calls when anticipating a price drop.  A put option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, while a call buyer is bullish.  Given the depth of bitcoin's drop from its Nov. 10 record near $69,000 – it was trading recently about 2.6% down on the day at $36,900 – increased buying of puts is hardly surprising. It might, however, indicate an excess of fear.  Traditional market participants usually use the ratio as a contrary indicator, meaning a sudden surge in the metric is taken to represent the extreme bearish sentiment that's often seen at the end of bear runs.  Other metrics like the call-put skew, which measures the price differential between calls and puts, are also exhibiting a put bias. The one-week, one-, three- and six-month skews all returned negative values at press time, a sign puts were drawing higher prices than calls, according to data provided by Genesis Volatility.  ""The skew is the direction of the options premium,"" said Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto-asset management company Blofin. ""When the bearish sentiment is strong, the put option premium is more and the options skew is negative. When the bullish sentiment is strong, the options skew is positive because the call option premium is more.""  While both the put-call open interest ratio and the skew indicate the same thing, the latter is more reliable, according to Ardern, because it calculates real-time data and is not affected by open contracts. Historically, the six-month call-put skew has been more reliable as a contrary indicator, showing put bias near price bottoms, as observed after the March 2020 crash and the May 2021 slide.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/31/bitcoins-put-call-ratio-hits-6-month-high-as-negativity-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e020da44f057df99c82c5f2eb9360c934b369bfc-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bank’s fair value estimate for bitcoin (BTC) based on the volatility ratio of bitcoin to gold fell to around four times, or $38,000, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in the note published last week.  JPMorgan said its previous forecast of the bitcoin-to-gold ratio falling to around two times now seems unrealistic. The bank sees significant headwinds for both bitcoin and ether.  The challenge for ether (ETH) is different from that for bitcoin because ether derives most of its value as a “decentralized application currency rather than a form of digital gold,” JPMorgan said.  The Ethereum blockchain is facing challenges due to declining market share in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible-token (NFT) sectors, the bank said. During this month’s market correction, Ethereum failed to recapture market share from its main competitors, with ether prices falling by a similar magnitude compared with smaller alternative coins (altcoins), the bank added.  Similar to last May, unwinding of leveraged futures contracts played a significant role in the crypto market correction in recent weeks, the bank said, but this month’s unwinding of positions seems less severe.

GameFi is far from being a simple online game. GameFi are gaming platforms that allow users to get profits in digital coins from gaming. On one side, it improves user retention rates, on the other - it helps users earn real money within a game. To start gaming and earning, a user has to buy a character or a gaming asset that is presented in the form of a non-fungible token - NFT. Largely owing to GameFi, the NFT market has achieved such unprecedented growth rates in 2021. According to the DappRadar statistics, the non-fungible tokens trading volumes have grown hundreds of times - from $100 million in 2020 to $23 billion in 2021.

If bitcoin trades below $28,000 the market may expect further weakness as this is around last year’s lows. On the upside, $45,000 is the level to watch because that would suggest the recent downtrend may be turning around, the report said.  The bank notes that bitcoin has witnessed 15 bear markets since its creation in 2009, and the correction seen in recent months is within the range of what has happened before.  “Until bitcoin is commonly used as a currency for goods and services transactions (in the crypto or non-crypto world), it is hard to value bitcoin on fundamental demand beyond the asset speculation,” Morgan Stanley said.  Crypto investors may need to be patient if we are in the middle of a bigger risk market correction, the bank said. Alternatively, leverage in the crypto market would need to rise for a bullish trend to begin as central bank liquidity is removed, it said.  Regulation, non-fungible-tokens (NFT) and stablecoin issuance are areas to watch in the coming months, according to the note.

These will be used to reward new and existing BitMEX users and allow them to get discounts on trading fees.  The tokens are distributed as follows: 5% are reserved for future airdrops, 20% for liquidity provision when BMEX spot trading is launched, 20% as BitMEX employee incentives, 30% for marketing and affiliate rewards and 25% as a long-term reserve.  In its token litepaper, BitMEX said BMEX tokens allow the exchange to expand services and attract newer users. This is a step further than its initial founding as a purely futures-based crypto exchange. Futures are popular financial instruments that track asset prices.  BitMEX intends to burn BMEX every quarter to increase utility for holders, the exchange said in the litepaper, or shortened white paper.  Tokens holders get free access to BitMEX Academy courses and private community channels and an increased rate of return on BitMEX EARN deposits, the exchange’s passive earning product.  Savvier benefits include invites to exclusive events, BitMEX merchandise, and VIP tickets to sports events for holders of 500,000 BMEX and above.  Holders can stake BMEX starting Feb. 1.

Bitcoin traded under $37,400 at press time, having violated the support earlier this month. The MACD must remain negative through Monday's UTC (23:59) close to confirm the sell signal.  The monthly MACD last crossed into bearish territory in July 2018. The cryptocurrency more than halved to $3,500 in subsequent months, extending the decline from record highs near $20,000.
