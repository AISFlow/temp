42402203,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3drH,1542321013,What We Know About Bitcoin Cash's Two Rival Blockchains,"At 18:02 UTC, the bitcoin cash blockchain officially split in two.  With one iteration of the bitcoin cash protocol called Bitcoin ""Satoshi’s Vision,"" or Bitcoin SV, directly opposing the upgrades introduced through the project's long-dominant Bitcoin ABC implementation, the blockchain forked into two distinct networks, with two separate cryptocurrencies.  And while a so-called ""hash war"" had been greatly anticipated, for now – at least – the two chains are steadily mining blocks on their respective networks. At press time, threats of cross-chain sabotage hinted at by Bitcoin SV proponents have yet to materialize, nor has any retaliation from the ABC camp.  Initially, the Bitcoin ABC network was the only bitcoin cash platform to successfully create new blocks and validate transactions after the system upgrade (or hard fork) went live. Two blocks in, however, the Bitcoin SV network saw its first block mined at 18:29 UTC.  Mining pool Mempool mined the first block of Bitcoin SV, with SVPool and Coingeek mining subsequent blocks. Mining pools Bitcoin.com, BTC.com and Antpool have controlled the ABC action to date.  As of press time, Bitcoin ABC is 10 blocks ahead of Bitcoin SV, according to data compiled by Coin Dance.  How it's all playing out  Thus far, most blocks mined on the Bitcoin ABC network have featured over 1,000 transactions, though starting at 20:48 UTC a significant drop in both block size and transaction count was recorded on blockchain explorer site Blockchair.  A few hours before hard fork activation, mining pools purporting to support the Bitcoin SV roadmap controlled a supermajority of the bitcoin cash network. However, according to bitcoin cash monitoring site CoinDance, Bitcoin ABC is now leading in terms of total hash power support.  One such example that received high attention over the course of today’s events was mining pool Bitcoin.com, which released an announcement to users saying all hash power going into mining the bitcoin blockchain would be temporarily deployed to mine Bitcoin ABC blocks.  Though this announcement received negative feedback from those who claimed the organization had no legal right to redirect mining support in this way, data on the site indicates that starting at 17:30 UTC the mining pool has steadily been reallocating hash power in support of the Bitcoin ABC blockchain.    In fact, as of press time, bitcoin.com purports that a total of 4218.89 Ph/s of hash power is being used to mine blocks on the Bitcoin ABC network; just one day prior that figure sat at roughly 240.00 Ph/s.    Remaining questions  As might be expected, the existence of two bitcoin cash chains leaves many questions, primarily regarding what will transpire in the days that come – and whether one chain ultimately gives way to another.  There was also an event Thursday that left lingering questions: as shown by blockchain explorer BlockDozer, a major spike in activity occurred within minutes of the chain split.    Who caused this spike in transaction activity – and for what purpose – remains unknown at this time, though the potential for another spam attack in efforts to overload either network is an ongoing possibility.    What’s more, wild fluctuations in bitcoin cash price were also seen throughout the day across different cryptocurrency exchanges.  Depending on ongoing hash power support and implementation of either software upgrade from users, prices could continue to see swings – but given the uniqueness of the scenario, it's difficult to say at this time.  According to numbers on crypto exchange Poloniex, the comparative value estimated of both bitcoin cash cryptocurrencies is currently about $94 for Bitcoin SV and $285 for Bitcoin ABC.

42402190,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3dfT,1542315605,Binance Warns Iranian Traders to Withdraw Crypto Amid Sanctions,"Binance is advising its remaining users in Iran to withdraw their money as the cryptocurrency exchange seeks to comply with U.S. sanctions.  “If you have an account with Binance and fall into that [sanctions] category, please withdraw your assets from Binance as soon as possible,” reads an email received in recent days by Iranian users, according to several local sources.  Sepehr Mohamadi, chairman of the board of the Blockchain Association of Iran, said emails like this have been trickling in for months, but their numbers recently increased following renewed U.S. sanctions, which activated on November 5.  At first, Malta-based Binance, which declined to comment for this article, was mainly shuttering accounts of users who provided Iranian passports as part of the know-your-customer (KYC) process, according to sources in Iran. But this week it also began warning accounts connected to Iranian IP addresses to get their crypto out, several Iranian traders said.  “Iranians are not really able to trust cryptocurrency exchanges,” Nima Dehqan, a researcher at the Tehran-based blockchain project Areatak, told CoinDesk. ""That isn't really something new.""  Indeed, BitMex and Bittrex are just a few of the many exchanges that banned Iranian users over the past year, sometimes without refunding the crypto they held for these customers.  “It would be difficult [for the exchanges] to serve users in these jurisdictions if they want to serve American citizens,” John Collins, a partner at the FS Vector consulting firm in Washington, D.C., and former head of policy at Coinbase, told CoinDesk. “It’s logical to say that many companies are looking to the States right now and adapting to the U.S. regulation.”  As such, Dehqan said this has forced the Iranian bitcoin community to band together to create local businesses and support networks.  “We do actually have cryptocurrency groups in Telegram or WhatsApp for people who want to change their cryptocurrencies in person,” Dehqan said. “People have to trust each other. It’s a bit of closer-knit community in Iran.”  Some vendors have even set up physical shops and conduct traditional KYC, just in case Iranian authorities ask about their activities.  Stepping back, U.S. regulatory crackdowns against trading platforms such as EtherDelta have inspired some exchanges that serve American customers to start being more cautious about KYC requirements. And, according to SimilarWeb, roughly 13 percent of Binance’s website traffic comes from the U.S.  “Regulators are starting to focus more on exchanges,” said attorney Nelson Rosario, who specializes in legal issues related to cryptocurrency at the Chicago-based firm Smolinski Rosario Law. Regarding Binance’s moves to de-risk, he added:  “This is an example of how operating a business that deals with people all around the world can be extremely complex and it is nearly impossible to identify all the potential pitfalls in advance.”  However, Rosario noted, Binance doesn’t have any operations in the U.S. and regulators have been paying the most attention to local companies.  Mining for themselves  Binance is cutting ties with Iranian customers at a time when Iranian authorities are reportedly moving forward with plans for a national cryptocurrency akin to Venezuela's petro.  Mahmoud Eskandari, a Binance user and blockchain developer in Tehran, told CoinDesk he worries the government wants to “completely dominate the economic crisis” by controlling the crypto market.  Such concerns are driving many Iranian crypto fans to establish small mining operations, rather than rely on external platforms.  The narrowing range of exchange options has not dampened crypto fever among Iranians, however.  Dehqan said the Binance news isn’t having a dramatic impact on Tehran’s bitcoin community because more Iranians mine cryptocurrency or hodl their assets, to hedge against inflation, than engage in speculative trading. He added:  “The sanctions don’t have much effect on mining bitcoin. It’s actually profitable in Iran, compared to other countries.”  Over the past year, Dehqan said Areatak has received inquiries for more than 1,000 colocation mining contracts, setting up the infrastructure and charging miners a percentage of their earnings, because electricity is so cheap.  Dehqan estimated cryptocurrency mining in Iran requires a quarter of the electricity costs, less than a single cent per kilowatt hour, than mining in most industrialized countries.  “Many people from other cities come to Tehran to buy mining devices,” said Eskandari, who also mines both bitcoin and ethereum. “My friend sells Antminers and mining devices in Tehran. He sold about 100 devices in the past month.”  According to Iranian news reports, local regulators are also hammering out a legal system for tallying this burgeoning mining industry.  “We have a lot of investors that have visited Iran since the World Mining Summit,” Dehqan said. “All and all, you can actually access buying cryptocurrency in Iran and that’s the only thing that matters.”  Anna Baydakova contributed reporting.

42402200,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3dpJ,1542305154,Bitcoin Cash Just Split Into Two Blockchains,"The code for Bitcoin cash's hard fork has been activated.  With neither side of the contentious debate leading up to the hard fork willing to come to a compromise, two competing implementations of the protocol have now been activated. However, it's unclear at this juncture which of the two will become the dominant software of the BCH network – or if two distinct chains will continue to co-exist in the long-term.  The last ""common block"" among bitcoin cash miners was #556,766, mined by SVPool. As of press time, Bitcoin.com – which is supporting Bitcoin ABC – had mined a new block, signifying that the two chains have divided into two, according to data from Coin.Dance.  To recap, the implementation put out by leading bitcoin cash developer group Bitcoin ABC introduces a series of technical upgrades to the network, such as a reordering of transactions to increase block capacity as well as additional code to support greater interoperability between cryptocurrencies.  The other implementation, dubbed Bitcoin “Satoshi’s Vision” or Bitcoin SV, rejects these changes to instead restore retired code from the original bitcoin protocol and increases the block size from 32 MB to 128 MB.  In the lead-up to this event, threats of chain sabotage by avid Bitcoin SV supporter Craig Wright suggested the potential use of hash power to mine both a Bitcoin SV chain and create empty blocks on an opposing Bitcoin ABC chain, which could fatally damage operations on the opposing network.  Though refuted by Bitcoin ABC supporters as unlikely, data three days prior to hard fork activation revealed that bitcoin cash mining pools supporting Bitcoin SV actually consolidated a majority of the network's total hash power, suggesting strong capability to follow through on the threat.  These numbers as they relate to hash power are still highly subject to change.

42402196,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3djP,1542301241,This Bitcoin Skeptic Wants to Make 'Stable' Cryptos for Venezuela,"Economist Steve Hanke often scoffs that bitcoin isn't ""a real currency."" The Johns Hopkins University professor has also compared the cryptocurrency market to the Dutch tulip bubble, and even went so far once as to claim crypto exchange hacks prove these assets are “unstable and unsafe.”  Now he's working for a crypto startup.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Hanke recently joined the board of the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange AirTM. He will guide the Mexico City-based startup's expansion in Latin America, including a new system for price-stable assets that Hanke will design himself.  “He’s very close to the problems that we are trying to solve,” AirTM CEO Ruben Galindo told CoinDesk, suggesting inflation in Argentina and Mexico might make those markets ripe for user acquisition and marketing campaigns.  Indeed, throughout his career, Hanke has advised several governments, including Argentina (which, it should be noted, did not fully heed his advice), on ways to stabilize their currencies with a combination of exchange controls and fiat-pegged reserves.  “Imagine you’re playing with golf and get to play with Tiger Woods. That’s how we feel with Hanke,” Galindo said.  This seemingly unlikely alliance comes at a time when so-called stablecoins are all the rage, with several new assets of this kind launching this year to compete with the long-running and dominant but beleaguered tether (USDT). While the main use case for stablecoins so far is allowing crypto traders to move money between exchanges quickly without relying on the banking system, AirTM is among those that see broader applications.  Despite his skepticism about other crypto coins, Hanke told CoinDesk he sees potential in price-stable digital assets, saying:  “It is a good idea conceptually, but no one knows how to do it... I know how to do it. I’ve done it.”  AirTM now has two separate stablecoin projects. Previously, the company started issuing an ethereum-based token collateralized by fiat.  “AirTM dollars will be an ERC20 token that will be backed by dollars in our reserve, with the help of our banking partner Synapsify,” Galindo said. “I see a great value for stablecoins in developing nations.”  There is already $3 million worth of AirTM dollars in circulation out of the total supply worth $10 million.  Perhaps more ambitiously, Hanke will design a currency-board style system for issuing price-stable digital currencies through AirTM. According to Hanke, a currency board – a type of monetary authority that prioritizes fixed exchange rates over the other objectives of central banks – guarantees the asset’s price remains perfectly stable against the anchor.  'Dollarization machine'  It’s unclear what Hanke’s upcoming AirTM assets will eventually look like, or how they will fit into the AirTM ecosystem, although the economist expects his design will also involve blockchain technology.  “It would be a unit of account that is stable and could be used for clearing,” he said, adding this new asset would not be as speculative as cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  In Hanke’s mind, the fact that bitcoin was designed so that the overall supply capped at 21 million digital coins inherently guarantees its price will be speculative. He prefers to focus on dollarization, the process of aligning monetary policies with anchors such as the U.S. greenback.  “You have a completely inelastic supply curve,” he said of bitcoin, meaning the amount to be issued is set in stone regardless of what the price does. “Who in their right mind would make a contract with bitcoin?”  Hanke told CoinDesk he was drawn to AirTM because the company, which he described as a digital clearing house helping Venezuelans swap bolivars for U.S. dollars, has some of the world’s best primary data about Venezuelan currency trading. As of May 2018, the company’s records showed 65 percent of AirTM’s 4,000 daily users hailed from inflation-riddled Venezuela.  The startup itself needed guidance on macroeconomics as it expands across Latin America, plus insights into how to offer a greater variety of stable assets across borders. Hanke wanted a way to apply his research and experience to the current crisis in Venezuela. It was a perfect match.  This economist believes his upcoming blockchain solutions will offer a more stable unit of account that meets bitcoin’s original objective outlined in the decade-old white paper, which stated the cryptocurrency would be a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash” allowing “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”  Galindo, a veteran bitcoin user, said he’s excited to offer a variety of cryptocurrency tools to users in inflation-riddled countries. He described AirTM as a “dollarization machine” for Latin America.  “If people have a use for bitcoin for some reason, we’ll give them access to it,” Galindo said. “In the future, it will be so much easier to issue new currencies on a digital currency-board type of thing than with paper.”  The entrepreneur went on to say he doesn’t judge assets based on how people use them, whether for speculation, trade or clearing. Unlike the academic Hanke, Galindo avoids labeling which assets are “currencies.”  Instead, the AirTM team aims to provide Latin Americans with lawful on-ramps for useful assets, regardless of form. Overall, Latin American crypto users conduct $9 million worth of transactions a month through AirTM's businesses.  “We don’t care who owns the asset. If it’s the Venezuelan government who wants to have a USD reserve and they want to audit it, we wouldn’t mind giving people access to that,"" Galindo said, concluding:  ""If in the future, a president calls Professor Hanke up and says we want to solve hyperinflation, he will know that AirTM has the infrastructure to do that.”  Steve Hanke image via YouTube",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/15/this-bitcoin-skeptic-wants-to-make-stable-cryptos-for-venezuela,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2b049e58283208eb120d6206461c9e38e9b1685-1500x964.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402187,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3dbX,1542298994,Coinbase-Backed 'Gods Unchained' Releases Gameplay Trailer,"The blockchain-based card game Gods Unchained is giving would-be players a glimpse of what it will actually look like in action.  The fantasy-themed trading card game, which draws inspiration from Magic: the Gathering and Hearthstone, uses the ethereum blockchain to house cards in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It has attracted attention from big-name investor Coinbase Ventures, which participated in a $2.4 million seed funding round led by Continue Capital and Nirvana Capital in May.  Fuel Games, the Sydney-based startup behind Gods Unchained, has also managed to win over the market despite tough conditions for crypto companies. In July it sold a single card – the ""Mythic Hyperion"" – for 146 ether, which at that time was worth over $60,000.  Notably, that sale was within sight of the record auction price for a trading card, set at $87,000 by a rare Magic card just days beforehand. Altogether, Fuel has sold around 1.6 million cards, bringing in $2.8 million, according to Fuel Games co-founder and CEO James Ferguson.  Now, in a new video shared exclusively with CoinDesk, Fuel Games is showing what buyers will be able to do with those cards:  Ferguson told CoinDesk:  ""When we set out to build Gods Unchained, we really wanted to deliver the quality you would expect from triple-A publishers.""  Gods Unchained will enter closed beta in the next couple of weeks, said Ferguson, allowing the company to ""stress test"" the game with players who have purchased cards. An open beta period of around three months will come next, followed by full launch.  Fuel Games has departed from normal blockchain gaming practices in developing Gods Unchained. Gameplay happens on Fuel's servers, given the transaction costs and and slow processing associated with on-chain gaming.  Fuel also used the Unity game engine to develop the game, rather than having it ""live in the browser,"" said Ferguson, because ""we knew very early on that what we wanted wasn't possible in browser.""  Ethereum plays a key role in Gods Unchained, however, given that the cards live on the blockchain as NFTs, the technology behind CryptoKitties. That way – the designers say – ""nerfing,"" or intentionally weakening, the cards won't be possible.

42402185,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3daY,1542297618,Police Arrest 8 Over Alleged $68 Million Crypto Pyramid Scheme in Japan,"Police in Tokyo have arrested eight men alleged to have run a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme that collected 7.8 billion yen (almost $69 million) from thousands of victims across the country.  According to a report from The Asahi Shimbun on Wednesday, the men were suspected by the police of breaking the country’s financial laws by not registering their business with the regulators and using cryptocurrencies to mask their actions.  The men had reportedly touted a bogus investment firm called “Sener” they claimed was be based in the U.S., and collected 29 million yen (about $2,55,403) in cash from nine people, between February and May 2017, in order to purchase bitcoins on their behalf, police reportedly said.  The eight are said to have collected most of the payments in bitcoin, as well as another 500 million yen (about $4.40 million) in cash. About 6,000 people in total were affected by the scheme.  At seminars, the eight apparently offered attendees monthly returns of 3–20 percent, with rewards if they persuaded others to join the scheme.  Six of the men admitted to the allegations, while the remaining two did not, according to the report.  The case comes after a number of recent reports of major crypto scams in the region, with two men in South Korea sentenced in April for running a $20 million bitcoin pyramid scheme.  China has seen similar cases too. In one, 98 people associated with the notorious onecoin scheme were prosecuted in May for amassing $2 billion from victims. Another, a month prior, took $13 million.

42402202,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3doK,1542296438,"Ahead of Bitcoin Cash Fork, Mining Power Still Favors SV","Bitcoin cash is expected to execute its scheduled hard fork in the next few hours, but warring mining-pool factions continue to duke it out over control of the network.  According to Coin Dance, mining pools supporting Bitcoin SV lost some of their relative hash power over the past 24 hours, though they still maintain a majority with roughly 72.22 percent of the current network's power. In contrast, mining pools which likely support Bitcoin ABC mined 16.66 percent of the current network.  While the latter group of mining pools have increased their relative hash power from 11.11 percent roughly 24 hours ago, they have yet to match the 19 percent of the network they controlled earlier this week.  On the other hand, just two mining pools supporting Bitcoin SV – CoinGeek and SVPool – control more than 51 percent of the network hash power, meaning the two pools are potentially able to mine empty blocks on the Bitcoin ABC network as threatened by SV supporter Craig Wright.  It remains unclear whether all of the mining pools and nodes currently running bitcoin cash software will upgrade to the versions published by either Bitcoin SV or Bitcoin ABC, and whether the network will indeed split.  The hard fork is scheduled for roughly 16:40 UTC later today.  Price action  While Bitcoin SV's price briefly matched and even overtook Bitcoin ABC just a day before the anticipated fork, the two tokens' prices diverged sharply in pre-fork trading on crypto exchange Poloniex in the hours leading up to the fork.  As of 14:40 UTC, two hours before the anticipated fork, BCHABC's price rose to $289.58, up nearly 11 percent over a 24-hour period. In contrast, BCHSV's price dropped 45.54 percent to $122 over that same period of time.  Those prices remain volatile – as of 15:30 UTC, BCHABC fell nearly $40 before rising $25, and is trading at $282 at press time.  BCHSV continues to fall, dropping to $90 at press time – down nearly 60 percent over 24 hours.  Both tokens continue to trade at lower levels than bitcoin cash itself. While the year-old cryptocurrency's price fell concurrently with the overall market sell-off, the token's price remains at $385.58 as of press time.

42402197,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3dlN,1542290347,Crypto Custodian BitGo Adds New Stablecoins in Bid to Woo Institutions,"BitGo has added support for its 101st asset as the crypto custody startup works to offer a wide spectrum of services for institutional investors.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, BitGo now handles the Winklevoss brothers’ Gemini dollar (GUSD), which followed its hundredth asset, Circle’s Circle USD (USDC), added on Nov. 6. Both are so-called stablecoins, designed to maintain parity with the U.S. dollar, as are other BitGo additions over the past six months such as MakerDAO’s dai, Paxos’ Paxos Standard (PAX) and TrustToken’s TrueUSD (TUSD).  This asset class represents one of the year’s most popular new flavors of cryptocurrency, with a new stablecoin introduced seemingly every week promising the speed and ease of bitcoin without the volatility.  Isaac Eleftheriadis, BitGo’s senior technical product manager, told CoinDesk this stablecoin sprint was driven by demand from exchange platforms. According to the company’s internal record of API requests from October 9 to November 9, BitGo clients submitted 151,768 searches for TUSD and 137,649 for USDC, followed by dai with 28,894 API requests. These usually correlate to searches for wallet balances and transactions.  “When investors are looking for a place to custody their funds, they are looking for a one-stop-shop, a place to store all their crypto assets,” Eleftheriadis said. “Certainly, we are going to continue adding more coins and tokens.”  Although stablecoins are hardly the only category represented across BitGo’s offerings, some experts believe the trend of adding support for such assets highlights how competition is influencing the startup’s strategy.  Speaking to the rush among custodians to diversify while bitcoin’s price remains relatively low and (until Wednesday) stable, Meltem Demirors, founder of Athena Capital and chief strategy officer at the asset manager CoinShares, told CoinDesk:  “People [are] trying to find new revenue streams. And when that can’t be done through volume, it has to be done through adding new product lines, new premium services for which you can charge the user, and finding new ways to extend your business model.”  Indeed, the hardware wallet startup Ledger is simultaneously partnering with licensed financial institutions to offer custody solutions for 100 cryptos by 2020. Meanwhile, trading platforms like Silicon Valley unicorn Coinbase and traditional financial services provider Fidelity are looking to offer institutional custody services as well. The latter would focus on bitcoin, BitGo’s staple offering.  Bitcoin analyst Nik Bhatia agreed with Demirors, considering how many Wall Street institutions are exploring custody services of their own.  “It’s about whether they can prove to themselves this is a long-term business model,” Bhatia told CoinDesk. “I think demand will seek out the providers that fit what they are interested in.”  Stablecoin demand  Framing the move in a slightly different way, BitGo’s vice president of marketing, Clarissa Horowitz, told CoinDesk that this year was about reshaping the company’s model. The staff has doubled to more than 100 employees as it went from supporting 8 assets to 101 in less than a year, and it now has roughly 300 institutional customers.  “In 2018, we’ve been making a transition from being a technology company to a financial services company,” Horowitz said.  Only time will tell if BitGo’s strategy will help it attract more institutional customers as the competition heats up. Demirors, for one, is skeptical because such investors already have established relationships with brands like Fidelity and Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, which will launch a new trading and custody platform called Bakkt next month.  Plus, she said, custody services generally have a low profit margin driven by volume.  “The hard part will be for custody firms to justify their pricing,” Demirors said, adding:  “I would see no reason to hold dollarized tokens, which by the way are still susceptible to the risk of hacking, when you could take your money and park it with BNY Mellon, which offers FDIC deposit insurance and overnight lending rates on your cash. It just seems very inefficient.”  On the other hand, MakerDAO COO Steven Becker argued that dai, at least, has a use case beyond the usual stablecoin function of moving money rapidly between crypto exchanges. Specifically, he said it can serve as a hedge against volatility.  “If you’ve got a $150 worth of ETH [the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum network], you pledge that into what is called the CDP smart contract. You can generate, from the back of it, up to 100 dai,” Becker said. While dai is designed to hold its value with the dollar, the holder can redeem it for the pledged ether when the latter’s price recovers.  Hence, a custodian like BitGo that supports such assets is effectively giving investors another way to manage risk, Becker said. “It will open up the infrastructure for institutional holders.”  Regardless of whether these customers prefer fiat-backed or crypto-backed stablecoins, BitGo aims to cover the whole spectrum and diversify beyond bitcoin.  “This effort to support a really, really, broad array of coins and tokens, in order to accommodate these new institutional investors coming in is absolutely part of that focus,” Horowitz said.

42402201,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3dqI,1542283223,Coinbase CTO: Time May Be Right for Home Crypto Mining,"Timing is everything, even in crypto.  That's why a notable pioneer in consumer bitcoin mining is backing a startup seeking to take another stab at popularizing at-home crypto mining, a business with a long history of abrupt ends for early entrants that includes some of the industry's best known busts (Butterfly Labs, Alpha Technology and GAW Miners among them).  Still, Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan is betting a new startup called Coinmine, which announced pre-orders for its first home miner on Wednesday, might be able to reverse this trend.  Srinivasan said:  ""The big difference with decentralized mining in 2018 is that there are now so many different coins and tokens out there that it’s almost certainly possible to make a profit – or at least mine a decent amount of some crypto – via a decentralized home mining device like Coinmine.""  It's a notable perspective given that Srinivasan previously founded 21.co, a startup that emerged from stealth in 2015 with an ambitious plan to embed bitcoin miners in everyday devices. With that experience in mind, Srinivasan backed Coinmine during its angel round, while the company was still very much under wraps.  With its announcement, it revealed that Coinbase Ventures is now also a backer.  No stranger to home mining, 21.co attempted to foster an ecosystem of home mining by building the 21 Bitcoin Computer, built both to mine and run bitcoin-based apps.  21.co retired support for the device in 2017 and later pivoted to become Earn.com, a company that allowed people to earn bitcoin for replying to emails and completing other tasks. Earn was later acquired by Coinbase, at which point Srinivasan took on his current role.  More coins, more opportunities  Still, underlying the investment is Srinivasan's belief in a diversified crypto economy.  Despite his prior company's pivot away from mining, Srinivasan believes that crypto has changed in two substantial ways that make home mining more feasible in 2018 than 2015.  ""Back in 2015 only bitcoin had any significant share, so the viability of any decentralized mining approach was benchmarked against BTC alone as opposed to 1,000-plus new digital assets,"" he said.  Thanks to a boom that has brought to market thousands of cryptocurrencies, the technology's enthusiasts don't have to compete futilely against Bitmain and other giant pools.  ""The big difference with decentralized mining in 2018 is that there are now so many different coins and tokens out there that it’s almost certainly possible to make a profit – or at least mine a decent amount of some crypto – via a decentralized home mining device like Coinmine,"" Srinivasan wrote.  BoostVC cofounder Adam Draper spoke to similar themes when he told CoinDesk he'd backed his 100th crypto startup. He pledged to back 100 bitcoin startups in 2015, but he also saw the industry change into one where there was more to crypto than bitcoin.  Innovative new coins alone would not be enough to make Coinmine worth it, though. Srinivasan said it's also important that so many of these new tokens have been judged worthy enough by the market to maintain significant valuations.  Srinivasan sees Coinmine as a bet on more worthwhile coins to come. ""There will likely always be some asset or set of assets that Coinmine can mine which makes a profit,"" he wrote.  Changing with the times  Remote updates will be key to Coinmine's success, in Srinivasan's view.  He's optimistic about Coinmine's ability to add new coins later, and he foresees a future where the company could play a key role in launching new tokens. He said, ""If Coinmine gets to substantial scale, you might even see some new digital assets in the future with ASIC-resistant hash functions launching directly on Coinmine.""  Notably, the system is built to run two tokens: one proof-of-work, one proof-of-stake, though the latter will only be enabled with updates coming in 2019. The anticipated networks for staking currently listed on its website are: tezos, casper, dfinity, filecoin, spankchain, polkadot, cosmos and foam.  Still, users will pay a high price for that ease and convenience. As CEO Farbood Nivi explained to CoinDesk, Coinmine will automatically put users into mining pools. It's one more way of making the product plug-and-play, but it also cedes a significant amount of control.  Further, the company will take a 5 percent cut of users' earnings as they mine, according to a spokesperson for Coinmine.  As expected, hardcore crypto enthusiasts cast a lot of doubt on the new product's potential for return on investment. Rob Paone's tweet was representative, contending that for a $799 user, users could expect to earn roughly $5 per day, not counting whatever electricity costs accrued.  ""Sounds like it's more of a fun/hobby purchase than a purchase for expected return,"" Paone wrote.  That does seem to be the market Coinmine is aiming for: people for whom $799 is not a major investment and who believe in crypto enough that they think it will eventually see major gains (but also aren't interested enough to learn how to run their own rigs).  Srinivasan agreed, arguing that crypto should welcome Coinmine into the market as a new resource for increasing the security of various networks.  He wrote:  ""I believe that decentralized mining is an important idea and worth trying again. It’s mining as Satoshi intended: many devices around the world with no single point of failure.""

42402205,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3dtF,1542280514,Bitcoin Price Sell-Off Slows As RSI Hits Four-Year Low,"Bitcoin is looking oversold after a drop to 13-month lows Wednesday and could defend immediate support at $5,000 in the next few days.  The world’s top cryptocurrency by market value fell to $5,324 (price via Bitstamp) in a matter of hours yesterday, reaching its lowest level since Oct. 18. The average price across major exchanges, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index fell 10 percent – the biggest single-day drop since March 30.  While BTC had supposedly carved out a long-term bottom around $6,000, the convincing break below that level indicates a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached last December.  As a result, a deeper drop looks likely, albeit after a minor bout of range-bound trading, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is signaling bearish exhaustion.  Notably, the widely followed technical indicator is currently seen at 18, its lowest since September 2014. As the area below 30.00 represents oversold conditions, the bears may now take a breather before hitting the market with fresh offers.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,400 on Bitstamp, having clocked a high of $5,641 earlier today.  Daily chart  BTC closed at $5,595 yesterday, confirming a downside break of a nine-month-long descending triangle.  Meanwhile, the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have adopted a bearish bias, while the stacking order of the 50-day EMA, below the 100-day EMA, below the 200-day EMA, indicates that the path of least resistance is to the downside.  Monthly chart  Over on the monthly chart, BTC is trading below the support of the trendline connecting the November 2011 and August 2016 lows, validating the bearish view put forward by the bearish crossover between the 5- and 10-month EMAs in September.  The RSI is now threatening to turn bearish below 50.00 for the first time since September 2015.  To sum up, the odds are stacked in favor of a drop below the psychological support of $5,000, although the oversold daily RSI indicates that may not happen immediately.  View  BTC is looking south, although oversold conditions may help it hold above the psychological support of $5,000 in the next few days.  The probability of a stronger corrective rally in the near-term is quite low as a significant majority of investors, who had called a bottom around $6,000, may have turned bearish after yesterday's price drop.  The bearish pressure would weaken if prices close above the June low of $5,780.  The bearish view would be neutralized if the former-support-turned resistance of $6,000 is scaled.

42402199,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3dmM,1542275427,Bitmain Denies Reports CEO Jihan Wu Ousted from Bitcoin Miner's Board,"Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain has denied widely circulated reports that its co-CEO, Jihan Wu, has been ousted from the board of BitMain Technologies Holding Company, the entity currently seeking to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX).  The news first emerged on a Chinese cryptocurrency media site on Monday, which suggested that Wu and several other executive directors had left their positions at a different entity, Beijing Bitmain Technology Limited.  The report further cited a lawyer, not affiliated to Bitmain, who said the change meant Wu would no longer have executive power over Bitmain's operations. However, the report did not state clearly whether that comment was referring to Beijing Bitmain Technology or the holding company.  Various media reports have subsequently cited the news and alleged that Wu is no longer at the board of the holding company and hence has no voting power on the firm's management.  Based on a Chinese business registration database, Beijing Bitmain Technology did record board changes on Nov. 7.  Responding to a CoinDesk enquiry, however, a Bitmain representative said the board change was solely at the subsidiary company. Regarding BitMain Technologies Holding Company, the representative said: ""To be clear, there is no change in the board structure there.""  Board reshuffle  The structure reshuffle at the Beijing subsidiary shows that Ketuan ""Micree"" Zhan, who previously served as the chairman of the board, has now become an executive director of the subsidiary.  At the same time, Wu's role has changed from board director to supervisor, while other directors including Zhaofeng Zhao and Yuesheng Ge are no longer on the list of board directors, as per the database.  The company further stated in an email response:  ""As is standard listing practice, Bitmain is restructuring its board and group structure, to ensure it meets regulatory requirements on its road to IPO. This is to simplify the board structure to facilitate its management. There have been no board departures and co-founder Jihan Wu will continue to lead the company as co-chair, together with co-chief executive officer, Micree Zhan.""  Based on Bitmain's draft IPO prospectus, there are currently seven members of the holding company board. Zhan and Wu both serve as co-founder, executive director, co-chairman and co-chief executive officer. Ge and Luyao Liu both serve as executive directors.  The board also includes three independent non-executive directors, not affiliated to the holding company. The listing rules and guidance provided by the HKEX requires that any IPO issuer ""must appoint independent non-executive directors representing at least one-third of the board.""  Voting rights  Based on Bitmain's draft IPO prospectus, for now, both Zhan and Wu seem to be far from losing any voting power, as claimed in some reports. The holding company adopted weighted voting rights (WVR) – a dual-share structure – after WVR was given the green light by the HKEX in April following a years-long debate on the issue.  The prospectus stated Bitmain's share capital comprises Class A and Class B shares, adding:  ""Each Class A share entities the holder to exercise one vote, and each Class B share entitles the holder to exercise ten votes, respectively, on any resolution tabled at our Company's general meetings, except for resolutions with respect to a limited number of Reserved Matters, in relation to which each share is entitled to one vote.""  Currently, Zhan and Wu hold about 3.9 billion and 2.2 billion Class B shares, respectively, although the firm has yet to indicate what percentages those amounts represent of the company's entire Class B share ownership.  The HKEX had long adhered to a ""one share, one vote"" approach, a policy that prompted Chinese internet giant Alibaba to choose the New York Stock Exchange over Hong Kong when it went public in 2014.  The Hong Kong exchange later altered the rule in a bid to attract more technology startups, as the dual-share structure is popular among major international tech firms such as Facebook and Google.  BitMain is the fourth company to have adopted the WVR approach for an IPO since the HKEX changed the rule in April.

According to an update at the HKEX's database on Thursday, Canaan's IPO application has now exceeded its lifespan of six months since it was first submitted. The company had apparently been seeking to raise up to $2 billion, but a report from Reuters said Canaan has now scaled down the plan and is targeting about $400 million.  Based on listing rules and guidance provided by the HKEX, an IPO issuer can apply to reactive a filing after the initial time period is up, should it decide to. But if there is a delay of three months or more after expiration, the firm has to submit a new application and the previous filing would be considered as ""outdated.""  An executive director of Canaan Creative declined to comment on the issue. Currently, Canaan's filing at the HKEX is inaccessible.  The status change comes just weeks after the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in Hong Kong brought in a new regulation applicable to firms that have cryptocurrencies under management.  The SFC issued a circular early this month that requires companies that invest more than 10 percent of their gross portfolios in cryptocurrencies to be registered with the regulator, regardless whether such assets are considered securities.  The Reuters report, citing anonymous sources, further said the HKEX and financial regulators in Hong Kong have raised questions over Canaan's business model, given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. As such, the news agency said the IPO might not go ahead this year, since there have been no updates from a listing hearing with the HKEX.

42402198,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3dnL,1542258042,After the Fork: How Competing Bitcoin Cash Blockchains Might Wage War,"Bitcoin cash's ongoing war of words is set to reach a conclusion today.  That's when a planned technical update (and an ongoing disagreement over the proposed code changes) may lead two major bitcoin cash implementations – Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV – to split into separate blockchains.  In the days prior to the activation, rising contention from both camps has culminated in what has been termed as ""hash war,"" as mining pools ramp up their computing power to show support for the various implementations.  But rather than a future in which the two versions of bitcoin cash live in harmony, there's a degree of concern that, under a scenario in which two distinct blockchains emerge, that same mining power could be wielded as a weapon against one of the networks.  ""An SV miner can even legally kill off a chain. That is the miner's right. This is what bitcoin is,"" Craig Wright, the controversial chief scientist behind nChain, the company that leads the Bitcoin SV implementation, tweeted.  Hash power – the computing resources committed by miners toward securing a blockchain – has been fluctuating between both camps in the days prior to the activation, though all signs point to Bitcoin SV proponents having the upper hand on this front.  Because of bitcoin cash's underlying architecture, a 51 percent dominance in hash power will allow Bitcoin SV to launch attacks against the minority chain – and Wright has suggested that such action isn't off the table.  As such, according to Peter Rizun, the chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited (a bitcoin cash software implementation that supports Bitcoin ABC), the upcoming hash war is a test of what is known as bitcoin's underlying security assumption, dubbed the ""honest majority.""  Detailed in the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper, the honest majority assumption is based on the premise that security is only guaranteed if 51 percent – or a majority – of nodes are behaving non-maliciously.  ""The security of blockchains come from economic incentives, not from math. We cross our fingers and hope that a group of attacker nodes will choose to play by the rules. Maybe they won't,"" Rizun said, adding:  ""The coming hash battle is putting Satoshi's assumption to the test.""  The fork attacks  In effect, Wright sees the upcoming split in terms of bitcoin's longest chain rule – the underlying bitcoin consensus mechanism that defaults to the longest chain in the event of multiple blocks being found simultaneously.  When applied to a blockchain split, what this means essentially means is a fight to the death between the competing chains, where the last one standing would be considered the ""true"" bitcoin cash by nodes.  For example, both implementations have declined to add so-called ""replay protection,"" or code that allows funds to be safely spent when a split occurs.  “Neither Bitcoin SV nor Bitcoin ABC have implemented transaction replay protection, as the intention is for only one chain to survive,” nChain, the software company behind Bitcoin SV, wrote in a press release published earlier this month.  This means that without special precautions, users could lose funds while transacting on a split chain. Similarly, hackers can exploit the vulnerability to extract funds from exchanges.  ""Users potentially stand to lose money because of this decision,"" Chris Pacia, a developer for OpenBazaar, told CoinDesk, adding: ""Not adding replay protection is a dick move.""  And there are other ways that the two blockchains could continue to wage war following the fork – especially if one camp continues to dominate the hash power.  At the time of writing, the prevailing hash rate is showing a preference for the SV side. If the preference continues, there's a host of ways that Bitcoin SV could try to keep ABC from operating.  Empty blocks  For example, SV could mine empty blocks that do not contain transactions.  Combined with a majority hash rate, this could result in user transactions being rejected from the chain, essentially pushing the blockchain into stasis. According to Rizun, the cost of this attack ""is nearly zero for SV, assuming they have majority hash power.""  For the honest minority, however, the cost is extremely high.  ""They spend a lot of resources to find a block, only to have it orphaned and lose the 12.5 BCH block reward. The honest miners might give up,"" Rizun explained.  Alternatively, the miner could simply include useless or ""junk"" transactions into the blockchain, which would have a similar effect to empty blocks, but according to Chris Pacia, this approach also ""forces people to validate and store all the junk transactions.""  Double spend  Equally, having a 51 percent majority means that SV attackers could perform a so-called “double-spend attack,"" in which an attacker prints non-existent funds from an exchange.  A notorious attack within the cryptocurrency industry, such an attack requires the majority of hash power to function.  Given the hash power, a miner can produce blocks in secret that contain false transactions before injecting the transactions into the blockchain.  Still, in this case, Rizun depicted this attack as one of the least likely outcomes of the bitcoin cash fork, because, unlike hostile activity between competing chains, double-spends are ""blatantly criminal.""  'Satoshi's shotgun'  And there are other attacks that could be launched between the blockchains as well.  According to Pacia, it is also possible for an attacker with the majority hash rate to let the ABC chain grow, before using the majority hash power to override blocks.  “This would cause users, especially exchanges, to lose millions of dollars as they would see their transactions get reversed. [Wright] has threatened to do this,” Pacia said.  Additionally, Rizun listed ""poison-block attack, denial-of-service attacks, network-partition attacks, and zero-day exploits,"" among the kinds of activity that could arise between the warring factions.  For example, rumors have been building ahead of the release about something that has been nicknamed ""Satoshi's shotgun"" – which would inject large volumes of spam transactions into the competing chain. Spam transactions would flood the blockchain, slowing the time that it takes for standard transactions to be confirmed.  ""We saw [Satoshi's shotgun] in action on Nov. 10. Apparently, it generated up to 800 transactions per second,"" Rizun said.  The fair fight  Continuing, Rizun explained a further possibility – what he calls a “fair fight” – in which SV would simply prevent the changes that ABC intends to make from activating.  Another attack that requires the majority of hash rate in order to function, SV could mine blocks that are valid to both implementations but would punish miners that attempt to activate ABC changes by simply refusing to include them in a block.  “This way, SV could try to bleed the ABC-loyal miners dry until they give up on the changes,” Rizun said.  Such an attack would prevent ABC from activating and ensure that SV becomes dominate on the bitcoin cash blockchain. According to Rizun, this is the most sensible and cost-efficient form of attack, but ""also probably the most technically difficult to implement.""  “[It's] only really a good option if they actually care about BCH. If SV wants to destroy BCH, then [it] would not be a good option,” Rizun said.  And while it's unclear how Thursday's hard fork will play out, according to Rizun, such attacks are ""exciting,"" because they allow blockchains to be battle-tested in more robust scenarios.  ""People think you just make a blockchain and it becomes secure by some mathematical pixie dust. It doesn't,"" Rizun said, concluding:  ""We don't know if blockchains work. That might sound odd, but it's true.""

42402195,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3dkO,1542250904,Buy or Sell? What Traders Think About Today's Bitcoin Cash Fork,"All eyes are on the bitcoin cash (BCH) blockchain ahead of a scheduled technical upgrade tomorrow.  While it's a process that the world's fourth-largest blockchain by market capitalization undergoes every six months, at which point it asks all users operating the software to upgrade to a newer version, there's a twist this time around. Specifically, a deep contention over the cryptocurrency's technical direction.  While previous forks have been supported en masse by bitcoin cash developers and miners, there are now marked differences of opinion between supporters of two main versions of the software – Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV – over the future the direction of the code's specific features (Bitcoin SV, most notably, would continue boosting the software's block size).  This is significant for those who own or trade BCH because, if neither side has majority backing, then the bitcoin cash chain will undergo a split into separate blockchains, each with its own cryptocurrency.  This raises questions for investors and potentially brings opportunities into play.  Market movements  One way to begin to assess options ahead is to look at how other traders are already responding. Over the course of four days from Nov. 2–6, the price of bitcoin cash surged 49 percent to reach a two-month high.  Perhaps not coincidentally, the jump occurred within hours of major cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase announcing their support for the upcoming hard fork.  That's likely because, if the major exchanges are accommodating the fork, potentially millions of traders will have access to BCH buying and will just need to wait a little for their wait for the free coins, and, as such, a wave of demand was triggered by the news.  Cryptocurrency trader Josh Rager described the sudden surge in bitcoin cash’s recent performance as an anomaly when compared to the broader market, suggesting the price rise must be a result of hype surrounding the fork.  Rager told CoinDesk:  ""With current price action of BCH, it’s 100 percent related to the fork and support from exchanges. No other major cryptocurrency is seeing a notable price change.""  A technical analyst would argue though that all known information is reflected in the price of an asset and, by that logic, the sudden rise could have been foreseen. A trader going by the handle “Crypto Rand” did, in fact, suspect bitcoin cash was due for a big move anyway, although the fork news likely was the catalyst.  “Definitely the move was pushed by the news, but not only because of it. Technical analysis wise, it was also looking interesting. The current range proved solid for a long time having some good accumulation over there,"" he said.  Gauging sentiment  Since many notable cryptocurrency exchanges announced support for the fork, a few have even launched futures contract-like trading for future blockchains that could be created as a result of the split, which essentially act as placeholders until the fork is complete.  Poloniex's 'pre-fork trading' has been live since Nov. 8 but will come to a close at 15:00 on Nov. 15, and at the time of writing, BCHABC and BCHSV are trading at $250 and $175 respectively. Earlier today the gap between the two prices was much narrower, indicating favor towards a particular fork is not as one-sided as many first thought.  Indeed, it's an innovative way to gauge support for the fork, but a poll conducted by CoinDesk suggested the interest among causal traders was minimal.  When asked what their trading plans were ahead of the fork, a combined 76 percent of the 2,669 users answered they either plan to ""wait and see"" or are simply ""not interested.""  Philakone  , a prominent crypto analyst, also conducted a poll asking his audiences’ opinion on the upcoming fork.    So far, 41 percent have stated they felt BTCSV is likely to fail, with 36 percent believing it will succeed. By Thursday evening, we will know who guessed right.  Pro strategies  When looking at the price performance of past forks like zclassic or bitcoin private and their 90+ percent price declines, there's merit in using caution when considering holding onto a forked coin long-term.  This sentiment does not seem to be lost among the traders who all agree entering a trade now would contradict their risk management practices. “I would sell half instantly and trade the other half during the next week,” Rand said.  A trader going by the tag ""Credible Crypto"" agreed, speaking to the short-term outlook that cryptocurrency traders tend to abide by:  ""Most are in this for a quick profit and are not aiming to hold the newly forked coin for price appreciation. Those that sell first will win, the rest will be left behind (at least until the price for this coin stabilizes).""  Popular Twitter crypto analyst Nick Cote offered some final wisdom.  “I wouldn't be buying here. Buying in hope of something is a sure way to lose money over the long-term,"" he concluded.
