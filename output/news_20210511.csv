42434343,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPBz3h,1620776597,LoserSwap's LOWB Is Badge of Honor for Self-Deprecating Chinese Crypto Traders,"It’s a truism among government officials, from the Bank of England's governor to the U.S. Treasury secretary, that cryptocurrencies can lead to painful losses for hapless traders piling into a risky game.      But a new cryptocurrency project in China named LoserSwap apparently seeks to own failure, and the concept is gaining a surprising following.      Loser coin, as the associated digital token is known, comes with the trading symbol LOWB – a derogatory term when expressed in the equivalent Chinese spelling. The token works as part of a decentralized platform for exchanging digital assets – similar to the popular protocol PancakeSwap atop Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is a public blockchain network started by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. LoserSwap is also based on BSC, and the LOWB/USDT pair first started trading on PancakeSwap.      The two-person team behind LoserSwap recently hosted an online “Ask Me Anything” event, which went viral on the Chinese app WeChat, with fans appearing to warm to the surprisingly candid answers.      “We missed out the whole bull run and are too scared to go into the market right now,” the team members said in response to a question on why they launched Loser Swap. “We decided to launch a token ourselves just for fun.”      At press time, LOWB was changing hands at $0.002139, doubling in price over the prior 24 hours, for a market capitalization of $120.6 million, based on a circulating supply of 60 billion tokens, per CoinMarketCap data.    Everyone here is a chive    The self-deprecation culture has deep roots in China, where small, individual investors in the domestic stock market often think they're exploited by big institutions that own the majority of shares. Mom-and-pop investors sometimes refer to themselves as “chives,” a common vegetable in the Chinese diet. The idea is that they’re ripe for harvesting and ingesting by big players, and are resigned to major losses.      The project’s website reads like a Chinese proverb on the inevitability of life’s letdowns.      “A poor young man from a fourth-tier city in China invited another poor programmer to jointly launch the loser coin project, the token LOWB,” it reads. “This project was established with a zero mentality. On the day of the project’s launch, the two people took out all their savings to add a liquidity pool. The project promised not to protect the market (mainly lacking strength) and not to run away.”      Trading patterns in LOWB bear remarkable similarities to the anything-goes, just-for-fun price pumps (and dumps) witnessed in social-media-fueled crazes like this year’s frenzy in the joke cryptocurrency dogecoin, or the stock-trading hijinks in GameStop shares in the U.S. stock market.      Just like the vegetable that regrows after parts are harvested, the LOWB price has shown a tendency to keep surging anew because the retail investors in China always return to the market – stocks or crypto – to test their luck once again.      Characterizations of the token’s supply – a crucial investing consideration for many investors in major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether – can’t be taken too seriously.      According to the project's website, there are 100 billion loser coins outstanding, including 20 billion distributed by airdrops, 20 billion to mining pools and 50 billion for in liquid mining “in the later stage.”      The project’s leaders “don’t know how to deal with” the remaining 10 billion, according to the website.      Such self-deprecation hasn’t stopped retail investors in China from pouring their money into LOWB. They see the project and its co-founders as straightforward, harmless, one of us.      There is already a loser coin fan website with the name “the head of chives.” Posters on the site repeatedly seek mutual assurances that fellow traders will buy and hold LOWB. They also share ridiculous posts about their experiences losing money in the bull market.    Rich taste is the worst taste    One post titled “How to know if you're a loser” listed seven criteria to qualify as a loser, including “loving cheap or free items such as LOWB,” and, “Always feel like you are not fitting in; you always lose money when everyone else is making money.”      “Most retail investors don't understand the technology” of the projects behind the tokens, said Jeff Zhang, co-founder of a China-based crypto investment firm BlockArk. “There has been a sense of fatigue and antipathy among them after investing in way too many crypto projects.”      On loser coin’s official Telegram group, there were nearly 2,000 active members around midnight in China on Tuesday half-jokingly and half-seriously discussing how they can become instantly rich.      “Time for late night snacks,” one user said in the Telegram group, with a picture of an often costly Chinese dish known as “Buddha jumps over the wall,” made with shark fin, quail eggs, sea cucumber and pork tendons. (Chives aren’t a key ingredient, for what it’s worth.)      “It looks very ‘winner,’” one user followed up.      “You do not look ‘low’ at all,” a second user commented. The derision was palpable.      Annabelle Huang, a partner at Hong Kong-based crypto finance service provider Amber Group, compared the popularity of loser coin to the recent affection in China for the shiba inu token, which bills itself as a “dogecoin killer.” The GameStop mania is another easy comparison, she said.      “Bitcoin is seen more as the establishment and institutional play,” Huang said. “So people are turning to tokens that are more grassroots.”      They just have to be ready to lose.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/11/loserswaps-lowb-is-badge-of-honor-for-self-deprecating-chinese-crypto-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93deabfb839fa9d42c1f25e24dc4eeca0ee4fbe1-1200x717.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415759,WkWFu5l5TZXnF1B32UXNfF,1620773774,"SEC Staff Calls Bitcoin ‘Highly Speculative,’ Hints at ETF Skepticism","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hinted that the bitcoin market’s volatility may mean it’s not yet ready to support an exchange-traded fund (ETF), though the regulator is monitoring the digital asset sector and is seeking input.  Bitcoin is a ""highly speculative"" asset, according to the staff statement, published Tuesday by the Division of Investment Management. The note warned investors in mutual funds that trade bitcoin futures may be taking on more risk than they realize.  The warning comes as high-profile funds from Morgan Stanley and BlackRock begin to diversify into bitcoin through adjacent products like cash-settled bitcoin futures and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust. Those bets represent major steps in the institutional adoption trend of the last 12 months. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)  While aimed at investors in mutual funds, Tuesday’s note has implications for bitcoin ETFs, which crypto proponents have been hoping to see for years.  “The staff, among other things, expect to … consider whether, in light of the experience of mutual funds investing in the bitcoin futures market, the bitcoin futures market could accommodate ETFs, which, unlike mutual funds, cannot prevent additional investor assets from coming into the ETF if the ETF becomes too large or dominant in the market, or if the liquidity in the market starts to wane,” the note said.  A robust bitcoin futures market was key to launching an ETF, Bitwise Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan told CoinDesk in February.  Proponents expected newly confirmed SEC Chair Gary Gensler to oversee the approval of an ETF. There are currently 10 crypto ETF proposals sitting before the SEC, and the agency is reviewing four currently.  On Thursday, Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas said the prospect of an ETF “isn’t dead yet, but it just took a nasty blow to the head.”  Read more: Buying Your First Crypto? 10 Things You Should Know  SEC staffers will “closely monitor'' mutual funds’ bitcoin positions with an eye toward ensuring investor protection, one of Gensler’s top priorities for the crypto space.  “The staff welcomes further input from ETFs and other market participants, particularly input that focuses on efforts to ensure compliance with the Investment Company Act and its rules and promote investor protection,” the statement said.  That means analyzing market liquidity, how funds are valuing their holdings, what impacts their positions have on bitcoin futures and the market itself and assessing whether fraud and manipulation might be influencing price.  BlackRock’s $27 billion Global Allocation Fund invested $6.5 million in bitcoin futures last year, for example. Morgan Stanley has also given a handful of its mutual funds permission to bet on cash-settled bitcoin futures, though it's unclear if the mega-bank has made any allocations.

Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said in an amendment to a bill.      Lummis is sponsoring an amendment to add blockchain to the “Endless Frontier Act,” a bipartisan bill that would create a Directorate for Technology and Innovation and set 10 “technology focus areas” for the new entity to evaluate and create a federal strategy to address. The bill will be marked up in committee on Wednesday, meaning the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation will vote on amendments and determine whether it will move to the full Senate for a vote.      Lummis’s amendment would increase the number of focus areas to 11 to “add distributed ledger technologies to the initial list.”      The current list of focus areas include artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, quantum computing, robotics, disaster prevention, communications technology, biotechnology, cybersecurity, energy and materials science.      The list can be modified after three years, according to the current form of the bill.      The Endless Frontier Act, which was originally introduced last year, aims to bolster the National Science Foundation, an independent government agency tasked with supporting research in science and engineering fields.      The 2021 version would appropriate $100 billion to the new technology directorate, with $5 billion available in the 2022 fiscal year.      “China is already rolling out a digital yuan in select cities, and they want to use it ultimately to undermine the position of the U.S. dollar in the financial world,” Lummis said in a statement. “This is a national security issue, and if the U.S. does not respond we will be left behind. This amendment will put our research and development efforts regarding blockchain and financial innovation into high gear, something that is desperately needed.”      Lummis, a first-term senator and one of the Senate’s first crypto proponents, is sponsoring the bill with support from Sen.

Gaining 1.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $54,657-$56,855 (CoinDesk 20)  Yearn.finance, eos jump big    The biggest CoinDesk 20 gainers Tuesday were yearn.finance (YFI), up 48%, and eos (EOS), jumping 36.6% as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto market maker GSR, told CoinDesk the jump in YFI, which is a lending and yield service where users can park crypto to make gains, comes from its ease of use.      “It’s been the Tesla of self-driving investment management,” Rosenblum said. He also compared yearn.finance’s founder, Andre Cronje, to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. However, Rosenblum had a caveat: ""Crypto moves a lot faster than autos, and others are hot on the trail.”      As for eos, Rosenblum pointed to eos creator Block.One’s $10 billion funding to build a new exchange infrastructure subsidiary, called Bullish Global. Eos is a developer platform for DeFi, a rival to Ethereum.      Peter Chan, lead trader at OneBit Quant, told CoinDesk he’s concerned about DeFi's continued success on Ethereum, which may be why alternative platforms like Eos are doing so well in digital-asset markets. Growth of the sector seems to still be adding to congestion on the Ethereum network, particularly when exchanging tokens on the decentralized exchange Uniswap.      “It’s been quite tough lately dealing with the insane gas prices,” Chan said. “Trading on Uniswap costs more than $200 per transaction now. Crazy.”      According to ETH Gas Station, Uniswap is one of the top generators of fees on Ethereum: Users have spent $2 million in the past 30 days paying for transactions to be processed on the exchange.    Ether volumes a bit higher than BTC, again    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was trading around $4,068 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), up 0.66% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-day, a bullish signal for market technicians.      “Ether has become a household name after having more than doubled since its breakout to new all-time highs in early April,” noted Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for consulting firm Fairlead Strategies. “The rally remains supported by positive short-, intermediate- and long-term momentum.”      Ether’s exchange volume, as tracked by CoinDesk Research, was holding its ground. In fact, ether volume for Monday was at $80 billion, while bitcoin was a bit below that, at $78 billion.      The last time ether volume surpassed BTC was a week ago, on May 4. Stockton also noted how far ether has come since the start of April, and said its lofty price could be due for a downturn.      “We will be sensitive to any overbought downturns, noting that April’s breakout point is 50% below current levels,” she added. According to CoinDesk 20 data, ether’s price closed at $1,968 on April 1.      “For the next week it will be critical to see if ETH consolidates around the $4,000 mark,” said John Willock, CEO of crypto custody provider Tritum. “A maturation and solidification of ETH as a reliable underlying network for DeFi to build on top of builds a very strong picture for ETH to push past $5,000 before the end of the month, if not the end of the week.”      Read More: DeFi Is Not TradFi: Why FATF’s Guidance Would Stifle Growth    Bitcoin in a $6,000 range the past two weeks    The price of bitcoin was up Tuesday at 1.3% as of press time. The largest cryptocurrency was above the 10-hour moving average but below the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians. A bitcoin fall during a quick selling period late Monday after the U.S. markets closed seems to have reversed Tuesday.      “Short-term overbought conditions are now a hindrance,” noted Fairlead’s Stockton. “The period of backing and filling that ensued in February has created a trading range on bitcoin’s chart within the context of its long-term uptrend.”      Over the past two weeks, bitcoin has stayed within a $6,000 variance range quite consistently, between $53,000-$59,000, according to CoinDesk 20 historical data.      While some may argue these tight price ranges give bitcoin increased “store of value” properties, the reality is that since April 16 bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has been rising. As of Monday’s closing data, bitcoin is at over 72% in 30-day volatility, its highest level since March 27.      Analysts are also keeping an eye on bitcoin’s dominance for a possible move upward. Dominance is still trending down 2% Tuesday, as of press time, and is below 45%, according to chart software TradingView.      “In general, I think BTC dominance has room to go up a bit as a correction against the current [altcoin] boom,” said Andrew Tu, an executive from quant trading firm Efficient Frontier. “But that would be short term and medium term. Alts should outperform ETH and BTC due to higher beta.”      Read More: Bitcoin Pullback Risk Rises as Whales Resume Selling    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all higher on Tuesday.

42434331,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPBybh,1620764494,What Stanley Druckenmiller's Inflation Warning Means for Crypto,"Hedge fund and forex titan Stanley Druckenmiller believes current Federal Reserve policy and U.S. deficit spending are setting the U.S. dollar on a path to collapse. This morning he told CNBC’s Joe Kernen that it’s “more likely than not” the U.S. dollar will lose its status as the global reserve currency within 15 years. Druckenmiller’s comments were focused on the Fed’s commitment to low interest rates and U.S. debt bond buybacks, moves that ultimately support U.S. deficit spending on coronavirus pandemic relief.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief Insights columnist.    Druckenmiller’s comments were positive for one group already effectively shorting the dollar: cryptocurrency advocates. With the euro a basket case and the Chinese Communist Party-backed yuan still viewed with suspicion, Druckenmiller doesn’t see another fiat currency that can play the universal mediation role of the dollar anytime soon. Instead, he thinks “the most likely replacement” for the dollar would be a “crypto-derived ledger system.”      This is a remarkable set of statements from Druckenmiller, considered by some to be the greatest foreign exchange trader in history: He was the architect, among other big trades, of George Soros’ legendary shorting of the British pound in 1992. Now he’s echoing one of the most fundamental talking points of bitcoin advocates, who have for a decade contrasted the orange coin’s immutably fixed issuance with the propensity of states to let the money printer go brrr.      Inflation hasn’t been a major worry for the U.S. economy for decades – in fact, before the pandemic, the Fed regarded inflation as too low for nearly a decade. But pandemic spending has pushed the U.S. deficit and debt to record highs, causing widespread concerns about inflation risk. Inflation can be a major headache for dollar-denominated investors, since it erodes their holdings and gains. It can also be an annoyance for workers and consumers, though wages tend to inflate along with prices.      If the dollar becomes less attractive as a tool for foreign governments and global traders, the unwinding of its global reserve status could be downright catastrophic for pretty much everyone in the U.S. Somewhere between 40% and 72% of all U.S. banknotes are believed to be held abroad, and dollars make up over 60% of national foreign exchange reserves worldwide, according to the International Monetary Fund. If faith erodes, attempts to sell those positions could create a vicious downward cycle in the dollar’s value, which would have an array of negative impacts at home.      Despite clear longer-term trends in U.S. debt, it’s far from clear that right now is really the time to rein in spending. Druckenmiller argues that the ongoing U.S. recovery is so strong that further pandemic relief spending is unnecessary and even risky – but the relief spending appears to have been crucial to creating that recovery in the first place. In fact, some argue that the U.S. response helped it ""win the pandemic"" by compensating for broad collapses in demand. Some also believe pandemic relief headed off economic damage on par with the Great Depression, which could have damaged the dollar’s international standing as much as moderate inflation, if not more.    Druckenmiller’s reserve currency endgame scenario shows one way that irresponsible government spending hurts everyone eventually.    Druckenmiller doesn’t dispute the importance of relief spending, instead more modestly arguing that it’s time to wind it down. It’s a broadly Keynesian argument: Grow the deficit while the private sector is down, then scale back when the broader economy recovers. It’s also arguably Monday morning quarterbacking because current relief programs, some set to last another six months, were in the pipeline before the success of the U.S. vaccine rollout was certain. It’s even debatable on its current merits – the U.S. real unemployment rate (U-6) is still above 10%, for instance, suggesting there’s plenty more slack in the overall economy.      That’s just one of the big disparities in what inflation means at different income levels. As mentioned, it’s investors and the wealthy who generally have the most to lose from inflation, which eats into dollar-denominated returns while also diluting the value of dollars held. Meanwhile, it has been workers, who are less likely to have significant savings or investments, who saw the greatest proportional benefit from pandemic relief spending and who will suffer most when it ends. Druckenmiller’s reserve currency endgame scenario shows one way that irresponsible government spending hurts everyone eventually, but in the short run pandemic relief has made a lot of regular people’s lives much better than they would have been.      This is almost never acknowledged in broader discussions of inflation, but it’s clear to see if you contrast current inflation worries with responses to then-President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cut package. The Congressional Budget Office estimated those cuts, which disproportionately benefited the rich, would contribute $1.9 trillion to deficits over 10 years, even accounting for added growth spurred by the cuts.      That’s just as big a budget hole as President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan created, but there was barely a peep about inflation following those tax cuts. That’s even more remarkable because the cuts came during a period of economic strength that made them, according to conventional thinking, economically unnecessary and even more likely to be inflationary than spending during a slowdown. Even more puzzling, many of the same people worried about pandemic inflation are simultaneously opposed to Biden’s attempts to partially reverse the Trump cuts.    Read more: JP Koning: Druckenmiller, Jones and Bitcoin’s Perfect Trading Machine    This all points to broader challenges that could come with any multinational reserve currency, crypto-derived or otherwise. While inflation is rightly feared, deficit spending is an important tool for nation-states to meet local political and social needs, particularly protecting the most vulnerable members of a society during crises. In a worst-case scenario, a global currency that totally usurps national currencies would limit a national government’s fiscal discretion to take these kinds of actions. This can be seen in the problems nations like Spain and Greece have weathered after giving up their own currency to use the euro.      But for nations that retain viable national currencies, a supranational reserve currency might be more moderating than constraining, particularly if it was accessible to the general public. Right now, the main options if your own currency is being mismanaged are to look for other nations doing it better or to buy gold. But a neutral, anti-inflationary reserve layer could be a much better refuge. If it were easy to buy and hold (for instance, through a public blockchain), distrust in a government’s fiscal policy would be quickly punished via falling currency demand. Meanwhile, governments would still have the flexibility to issue debt denominated in their own currencies when it was truly needed and supported by public sentiment.      But it’s hard to see a path there that doesn’t involve serious disruption for the dollar and the U.S. as a whole. The $1.9 trillion in pandemic spending, after all, was added to an existing mountain of government debt to reach the current total of more than $28 trillion. If waning faith in the dollar translates into less global appetite for holding that debt, Druckenmiller says rising interest rates could require as much as one-third of the U.S. annual budget be paid out in interest alone, from roughly 10% right now. That would be bad for just about everybody.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,David Z.

Vogel said on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program the Mexico-based exchange, with 2 million users in markets, including Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, has seen a sharp increase in demand for dollar-linked stablecoins USD coin and tether on the Bitso app.      “We are seeing a big demand for different stablecoins on our platform,” Vogel said.      Cryptocurrencies from bitcoin to ether are in various stages of adoption around the world, and Vogel’s comments might signal that stablecoins are becoming the latest hot purchase in Latin America and other emerging markets.      Stablecoins, which typically include digital tokens whose value is linked to a government-issued currency such as the U.S. dollar, could gain extra appeal in places where the local currencies tend to be less stable and possibly subject to capital controls because of inflation.

The stablecoin dai, from the MakerDAO protocol, initially had a leg up in Latin America because the efforts it made early on and it became the favorite of locals, Vogel said.

42434345,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPBz5h,1620761617,The Node: What's New Is Old,"There are plenty of million-dollar ideas in crypto, a movement that is trying to rebuild and reimagine everything digital. This development process is ad hoc, with individuals, companies and loosely affiliated teams identifying and executing on areas where crypto assets may, one day, offer greater access to, and ownership in, the digital economy. But this ambitious, mostly leaderless, multi-year process, touching everything from basic financial services to the internet architecture itself, sometimes runs in circles.      In March, conceptual artist and graphic designer Ryder Ripps, 34, announced his latest crypto-based effort, Million Token Website, built with his 16-year-old brother, Ezra. The concept is simple: An open-access, million-pixel canvas that allows nearly anyone or anything with a MetaMask wallet, at least .001 ETH and an idea to draw a picture on a plot of digital land.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    “Think of it as a new and improved version of the 2005 website, Million Dollar Homepage,” the brothers wrote on the project’s webpage. The “homepage” they reference was built by a British business student, Alex Tew, as a way to raise funds for college. The young entrepreneur had the idea to sell pixels – $1 per dot in 10-by-10 blocks. It became a phenomenon, spreading first by word of mouth and then by media coverage.      People crowded in. The grid filled out into a technicolor mosaic of advertisements, personal messages and digital graffiti. It was another signal that online real-estate was actually worth something. “To buy a block of pixels was, in theory, to leave one’s mark on a collective accomplishment reflective of the internet’s enormous power to connect people and generate value,” UC-Santa Barbara Professor John Bowers wrote of the project in the Harvard Business Review in 2017.      All said and done, Tew raised $1,037,100 (the last 1,000 pixels were auctioned on eBay for $38,100) and secured a position in the pantheon of early Web 2.0 experiments. The mosaic and webpage have remained online, more or less untouched, though a number of the images suffer from link rot.      Over the years, Million Dollar Homepage inspired a number of copycats. The Ripps brothers present just the latest in that lineage – though this time bringing the experiment into the world of crypto. It uses Ethereum-based NFTs and its own LAND token to extend actual ownership over these digital plots. Instead of a static webpage that will exist as long as Tew is willing to pay domain hosting fees, the Ripps brothers hope their effort will continue to evolve and remain relevant over time.      While the Ripps brothers own the domain name, which isn’t mirrored on Web 3.0 tools like IPFS or ENS, the actual grid units are owned by participants. (They also maintain control the NFT minting process, and have the ability rewrite obscene or illegal material.) People can sell or trade their tokens and overwrite their images whenever they please. The Ripps call it a model for the future of the ownership web.    Read more: The Problem of Authenticity in NFT Art    “We’re trying to do something that is much more community-driven and collaborative,” Ezra said in an interview. “NFTs are about ownership. We’re creating a visualization of [that process].” “The times are changing towards decentralized platforms and towards cryptocurrency,” Ryder added.      About 25% complete at time of writing, the brothers may raise a total of 1,000 ETH for their efforts. That would bring in over $4 million worth of crypto, if current ether prices hold. Not bad for a sequel.      Like the original homepage from which their project draws inspiration, the Ripps brothers view Million Token Website as a potentially historic statement. They admit the vision is limited (a canvas won’t change the world in itself) but it represents a shifting tide: a vision of the web that is even more commercialized, though with profits accruing to individuals rather than “FAANG” corporations.      Many of the early adopters see this, too.      “It's significance is evident through the involvement of such important artists and collectors in the NFT space in this space,” a representative for Art on Internet, an NFT collective, said over Telegram. Decentralized exchange SushiSwap, crypto-focused venture firm Future Fund and Adidas are among the early users.      Much of Ryder’s body of work has blurred the line between commerce and high art. He’s contemporaries with people like Beeple and Jeff Koons, whose greater statement is less about what a painting or sculpture says, than the price someone is willing to pay for it.      “Art is supposed to change your perception of what is possible in reality, whether that's someone who can paint in a way that is unbelievable, [or] in a way that you've never thought about it before,” the elder Ripps said.    Read more: NFTs Aren’t Art? OK, Boomer    One take here is that companies like Adidas or the artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collection, Virgil Abloh, are willing to bet on “bleeding edge” tech. Another is that the Million Token Website shows the limits of digital culture. Hauntology is the idea that the present cannot escape the shadow of the past, that the reason there are more blockbuster movie sequels than original scripts; that fashion routinely digs up trends from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s; that computer images rely on skeuomorphic design is because we’ve lost the ability to imagine anything new.      “It's kind of naive to think that there is truly original design,” Ryder said.      “You can't ‘invent’ something anymore, it feels like it's all been done,” 9272, a pseudonymous investor, said.

42434339,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPByxh,1620758528,FDIC Chief Says Agency Wants to Know More About Digital Assets,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), one of the federal banking regulators in the U.S. and one of two entities that provide deposit insurance to federally regulated institutions, is taking a look at how banks are exploring digital currencies, its top official said Tuesday.      Speaking to the Federalist Society, FDIC Chairwoman Jelena McWilliams said the federal regulator wants to hear from banks about how they are approaching the digital asset market and what role the FDIC should play.      ""At the FDIC, we have been watching such developments closely, and plan to issue a request for information to learn more what banks are doing, what banks are considering doing and what, if anything, the FDIC should do in this space,"" she said.      McWilliams noted that financial technology firms have been becoming more engaged in the U.S. banking sector, particularly through the COVID-19 pandemic, and the FDIC wants these fintech firms to collaborate with banks.      The FDIC joins other federal bank regulators in exploring the world of digital assets. The Federal Reserve, the U.S.'s central bank, last week published a proposal to allow certain chartered financial institutions access to its accounts. That move would benefit Wyoming Special Purpose Depository Institutions, which include Kraken Bank and Avanti, two crypto firms.      The National Credit Union Administration, a federal regulator that oversees credit unions, is dipping its toes into crypto, as well. Earlier this year, NCUA Vice Chairman Kyle Hauptman said his agency should explore issuing guidance for digital assets and assess how federal credit unions can interact with the industry. The NCUA has a job opening for a position that involves advising the agency on how to deal with digital assets.      The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), however, has taken the most concrete steps in bringing the banking sector together with the digital asset industry. Under former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks, the OCC published several pieces of guidance outlining how banks can interact with digital assets, and has now granted multiple federal trust charters to crypto firms.      The U.S. government is also researching a digital dollar, a central bank digital currency version of the greenback.      In her speech Tuesday, McWilliams said other countries are also evaluating sovereign digital currencies. She pointed to China's digital yuan as one example.      ""Far from merely a domestic endeavor, the digital yuan has the potential to expand internationally,"" she said. ""One recent estimate is this currency could eventually reach 1 billion users, all while bypassing U.S. dollar-related systems and ultimately the U.S. sanctions regime as well. This should give us a lot to think about.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/11/fdic-chief-says-agency-wants-to-know-more-about-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d2db83320417f8064dec58b86a3146bcd5573e1-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386724,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUhfT,1620757767,Yearn.finance's YFI Token Surges 22% to New Record as DeFi Platform Adds Collateral,"The digital-asset management platform Yearn.finance's governance token, YFI, jumped 22% Tuesday to an all-time high in price, joining the rally in recent months of cryptocurrencies linked to the fast-growing decentralized finance sector known as DeFi.      YFI clocked a new high of $78,019 around 14:30 coordinated universal time (10:30 a.m. ET) and was changing hands near $74,500 at press time.      The token's price has tripled this year. That includes a 40% rise so far in May, with most of that gain coming in the past 24 hours. But YFI has lagged behind other DeFi standouts. So far this year, the native token of decentalized protocol Aave, AAVE, has shot up 700% and MakerDAO's MKR. has risen 400%.      ""The rally was overdue, given the token's relative underperformance compared to other DeFi blue chips,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Although the token is still trailing its DeFi peers in price this year, the protocol has seen stronger growth in recent weeks.      Just since the start of April, Yearn.finance has more than doubled the collateral locked into its protocol, to about $4.1 billion, according to the website DeFi Pulse. During the same time frame, the total value locked in the DeFi market has increased by 70% to $80 billion.      ""Yearn's growth trajectory has been very strong,"" Vinokourov said.      YFI has a very small circulating supply, at around 36,000 coins, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. That helps explain why the token, which has a market capitalization of about $2.6 billion, has a higher price than the $56,558 bitcoin (BTC), which has a market value of $1.06 trillion.      Ease of use of YFI in a hot DeFi market, in addition to low supply, may be contributing to the high price.      ""It’s been the Tesla of self-driving investment management,"" said Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto market maker GSR.      Rosenblum said he's concerned about YFI's competition heating up, however.

42386736,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUhvp,1620756929,Ether's Run Takes 2021 to the Known Edges of Altcoin Season,"Cryptocurrency markets tend to vacillate between bitcoin-led regimes and altcoin-led regimes. In this view of the category, bitcoin is the original currency and everything else, including ethereum, is an alternative, based on the same principles but with tweaks or additions.      The altcoin-led regimes are called ""alt seasons."" Ether's rapid rise since the start of the year (it passed $4,000 over the weekend) has put 2021 so far firmly into alt season, following a the fourth quarter of last year that was led by bitcoin. Timing shifts in momentum between cycles such as these is important for investors seeking to maximize their returns in a crypto bull market.      The chart above looks at bitcoin vs. ether returns across bull and bear market regimes. Bitcoin is still the benchmark for all cryptocurrencies (for now anyway), and so we use its price to define the start and end of bull and bear markets.      The methodology is simple: A shift into a bull or bear market is defined as a bitcoin price change of 20% or greater, followed by at least 90 days during which the price does not return to its level before the change. It gives us a way to definitively, with a little patience, say what the market regime of bitcoin is – and by extension the entire cryptocurrency category. Methodologies like this are in line with the kind of work we're doing at CoinDesk Indexes.      As you can see from the chart, as of May 2, the current cycle wasn't out of line with past patterns. It still isn't. ETH at $4,000 puts returns for ETH at around 340% since its mid-March 2020 bottom. That's still within the pattern for an alt-season bull market, set in 2017. But at $4,000 ETH and $55,000 BTC, the gap between ether and bitcoin puts 2021 crypto markets at the edge of any altcoin season precedent. (To get insights like this in your inbox every Monday, sign up for CoinDesk Indexes' weekly newsletter, ""The Hard Fork"".)    New benchmarks?    One problem with this chart is it's measuring ether returns over bitcoin market cycles. That's fine for now, because ether may be gaining, but bitcoin is still the benchmark. But if the alt-season gap between ether and bitcoin widens further, we're likely to begin to see an erosion of bitcoin's viability as a market benchmark.      A more fundamental trend is the change in bitcoin dominance, which we've noted before. Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of bitcoin's market cap to the sum market cap of all cryptocurrencies. Ether's moves this week have pushed it below 45%, testing lows set in 2018.      The long-term decline in bitcoin dominance is a one-step-forward, two-steps-back kind of dance across bull and bear markets: In bear markets, a flight out of altcoins into the relative safety of bitcoin; in bull markets, an embrace of added risk that swells the altcoin share of the market.      If the trend continues, eventually we'll be looking for broader data sources as benchmarks for the market – the CoinDesk Digital Large Cap Index, for example. That would push crypto more in line with equity markets.

42386728,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUhll,1620755318,"For Filipinos, Axie Infinity Is More Than a Crypto Game","Axie Infinity is not an easy game to play. Nor is it simple to cash out your in-game earnings. But, never mind, this “play-to-earn” non-fungible token (NFT) game is spreading like wildfire in the Philippines.      I wrote about it back in August 2020, when I heard that about 100 people on a street in Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija, were playing the game to pay the bills and put food on the table after losing their jobs amid the COVID-19 lockdowns. Nueva Ecija is a rural province known for its rice fields and tens of thousands of tricycle drivers, the Philippines’ version of a motorcycle taxi.    Leah Callon-Butler is a CoinDesk columnist. In ""Play-to-Earn: NFT Gaming in the Philippines,"" a new documentary, she travels to Nueva Ecija to see how an Axie Infinity player community generated life-changing income from the game. At Consensus, CoinDesk's virtual event starting May 24, she will talk with key figures from the film.    Fast forward to today and the Philippines is the number one source of traffic for Axie Infinity globally (Axie itself just won a big new funding round). According to growth statistics supplied by Sky Mavis, the game’s developer, more than 29,000 people have downloaded Axie in the Philippines, up from around 10,000 in March 2021. That’s compared to a total 70,000 downloads around the world, with Axie’s next biggest sources of traffic coming from Indonesia and Venezuela, also emerging economies where homegrown jobs are lacking and relief from the crisis has been limited.      Axie Infinity is a leading game in the emerging play-to-earn movement, where players of blockchain games can earn yield in the form of tokens or other rewards. Those rewards can be used in-game, or they can be traded on an open market if the player chooses. The latter option represents an important shift in the gaming world because traditionally in-game assets were confined to the centralized protocol from where they came, unable to be moved off the platform.      For some, the play-to-earn concept is pure fun and a bit of pocket money. For others, as we are seeing in the Philippines, it has become a legitimate income-earning opportunity.      The success stories are wild. With the money earned playing Axie, people have bought everything from nappies and milk for their babies, to shoes and shirts to wear to job interviews. Families have paid their kids’ school fees and bought digital devices for their home schooling. Some bought motorcycles. More upgraded their mobile phones. Others are doing home renovations. This guy bought a block of land. And this 22-year-old bought a couple of houses. This overseas Filipino worker has earned enough from NFT gaming to be able to quit his job in South Korea and come home to his family in the Philippines.    Read more: Leah Callon-Butler: The NFT Game That Makes Cents for Filipinos During COVID    The trade volume for SLP, Axie’s in-game reward token, is now so great that cryptocurrency exchanges BloomX and Binance P2P offer a direct swap between SLP and the Philippine peso.      But with the game’s rising popularity, and expensive transaction fees on the Ethereum network, the price to get into Axie has increased significantly. In mid 2020, it cost just $5 to buy a team of three Axies – the Pokémon-inspired NFT pets whose owners battle them against other Axies for the chance to win SLP as their prize. Today, a decent team will set you back around $1,000.      This new price point is out of reach for many of those who are drawn to play-to-earn gaming. As such, there are now long waiting lists to get into a permissionless dApp.    Scholarships    To get around these high costs, the Axie community has developed scholarships. This is a profit-sharing model where Axie owners rent their NFTs to new players so they can play the game and start earning SLP without having to buy any NFTs or invest any money upfront.      Earnings are split among the player, the NFT’s owner and the community manager – the latter being the one responsible for recruiting, training and mentoring the virgin player. The only upfront requirement of the new player is time, enthusiasm and a willingness to learn.      It is not Sky Mavis who offers these scholarship programs. Rather, it is members of the Axie community who already own more Axies than they can feasibly battle themselves each day. So they rent them out, giving unused Axies greater utility.    Read more: Virtual Property Sells for $1.5M in Ether, Smashing NFT Record    The idea to rent your assets is one of the oldest business models in existence. Applying it to NFTs is new. And it’s only made possible in Axie Infinity because the player’s username and password are kept separate to the crypto wallet. This is different to most other dapps, where the user identity is the wallet. Instead, in Axie, the NFT owner can let other players borrow, use and enjoy their assets without having to give up their private keys.      Of course this isn’t a perfect arrangement. To begin with, it isn’t trustless. After several days of playing under a scholarship program, a fraudster Axie proprietor may decide to keep all the SLP earnings delivered to their wallet and refuse to pay the player their cut. Likewise, a player could operate multiple pseudonymous accounts to reap rewards across multiple scholarship programs simultaneously. This practice is strictly prohibited and actively monitored by community leaders.      Despite the know-your-customer (KYC) challenges, the phenomenon is only gaining momentum, with programs becoming more and more sophisticated. The earliest models originated between friends, where an amicable Axie owner offered to share an NFT with a friend, allowing the person to keep it on the proviso he or she would pay back the value of the asset once SLP was earned.      More contemporary models have used Excel spreadsheets to manually manage many multiple scholarship recipients and their accrued payouts. Some are even leveraging smart contracts and bots to automate payouts for hundreds if not thousands of Axie lessees.      Yet again, the world’s underserved populations are positioned squarely at the forefront of innovation, creating and delivering solutions to meet their own needs. In this case, it’s marginalized gaming communities showing the rest of the world what can actually be done with NFTs.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING | BNB,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/11/for-filipinos-axie-infinity-is-more-than-a-crypto-game,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f60d42e18572a3a0cbae5574020e7193b85508f2-1400x787.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Per data from BitInfoCharts and Blockchair, the average cost of an Ethereum transaction is currently $64, partly driven by demand for the Ethereum token (and Dogecoin doppelganger) Shiba Inu (SHIB) – and its own copycats. Binance exchange CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that the platform “ran out of ETH deposit addresses due to SHIB,” which “has never happened before for any ERC20 token.”      Ethereum’s fees, called gas, are priced in ETH and vary depending on the type of transactions; for example, a simple transfer costs less gas because it is less computationally intensive, while a transaction to swap, say, ETH for WBTC would cost more.    Read more: Gas Costs: Fueling the Blockchain Engine    SHIB was created last year, but the renewed trading interest appears to only be driven by speculation that the coin will mimic Dogecoin’s stupendous success (this success has come to pass, as SHIB is up 36,750% in 30 days, fueled by exchange listings at Binance, OKEx and Huobi). Dogecoin has become a favorite of TikTok influencers and the world’s second richest man, Elon Musk.      Nipping at the heels of both DOGE and SHIB’s success, other imitators have cropped up recently.

Dfinity Foundation's internet computer (ICP) token, which allows users to participate in and govern the blockchain network, went live on the U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase Pro on Monday.      Since then, several major cryptocurrency exchanges including Huobi, OKEx, and Binance have added support to the coin, leading to massive price swings.      The cryptocurrency was changing hands around $400 on Coinbase at press time, having dropped from $630 to $250 on Monday, per data provided by TradingView.      Prices tanked roughly 10 minutes after the Coinbase listing on Monday, shedding 60% in value to trade in line with the $300 to $400 price range implied earlier in the day on the FTX exchange’s derivatives contract linked to the ICP token.      ICP is the utility token of the Dfinity Foundation's platform and is used for governance, decision making and network transactions.      The platform has raised $121 million of equity funding, with investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital and Scalar Capital, among others.      Prices recovered some 70% from Monday's low, with traders taking a second punt on the cryptocurrency in the run-up to its listing on Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volumes, early today.      Binance said late Monday the token would be available for trading around 01:00 UTC on Tuesday (9 p.m. ET Monday). The coin opened at 249 USDT and was last seen trading around 420 USDT. It's trading at similar prices on OKEx and Huobi.      The price volatility of the ICP token may settle down as days progress and the market matures. Dfinity's long-awaited platform for smart contracts operating at internet speed went live on Friday, under the watchful gaze of the Network Nervous System.

42386731,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUhn1,1620746836,The Virgin Bitcoin Fallacy,"“Virgin coins” in Bitcoin are considered pristine due to their lack of transactional history. And they are something of a chimera – a mythical concept often spoken of but rarely witnessed.      We’ve heard a tremendous amount of noise about them, from miners seeking to brand themselves as compliant to bitcoin critics assailing their fungibility. Certain miners, seeking an edge, have begun to advertise or muse about OFAC (U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control)-compliant, KYC (know your customer)-enabled, low-climate-impact and taint-free mining. Coins mined with these assurances may well be attractive to certain classes of buyers interested in the provenance of their digital assets.    CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.    But do virgin coins, and more broadly, distinct miner-generated tiers of coins, actually exist? I’ve never seen any evidence of them, personally. Miners I know tell me they’ve never encountered buyers willing to pay a premium for virgin coins. But let’s say such a premium were to emerge. That is certainly plausible when it comes to coins provably mined by renewable energy, for instance. Establishing these coin tiers, however, is much more challenging than some might think.    Pools impair virginity    Almost all mining is done through pools. It allows you to smooth out the variance of finding blocks, of which there are only 144 a day on Bitcoin. On the blockchain, pooled mining looks like a coinbase transaction going to a single entity, and a distribution transaction (typically on a batched basis) to individual miners. In some cases, pools mine to exchanges directly, which then credit miners with those accounts. Thus, pooling introduces one or more hops into the process of miners actually taking delivery of their coins. Each successive transaction, especially when multiple parties are involved, increases the perceived “risk” of the coins, according to the taint theory. Thus the standard mode of mining doesn’t suit virgin coins.    Fees taint the coinbase output    Let’s say a miner chooses to spurn pools and goes it alone. That dramatically increases the variance of mining, and for smaller miners, would virtually guarantee that they would never win a block. Only the largest miners could do this, and their revenue would become much less predictable.      There are other lingering problems. Miners aren’t compensated based solely on the issuance of new coins (6.25 BTC per block). They also collect fees from users bidding for blockspace. Over the last six months, miners have collected 10-25% of their revenue from fees. Those fees derive from units of Bitcoin already in circulation. If non-virgin coins are considered tainted, the taint would be inherited from fees.    Read more: Marathon Miners Have Started Censoring Bitcoin Transactions; Here’s What That Means    Of course, miners could always institute a whitelist and only accept transactions and fees from trusted parties. But by limiting the addressable universe of transactors, miners are vastly diminishing their revenue opportunities. Those whitelisted transactors would only have to bid against each other, and not the broader set of users, and so you’d expect lower fees. Thus imposing a whitelist on mining is economically detrimental to miners, unless the premium paid by buyers (which again, I have never actually encountered in the market) outweighs the lost fee revenue. Over time, fees will eventually fully displace the block subsidy in the composition of miner revenue, so pools or miners that are selective about whom they serve will likely be structurally less profitable.    Transfers ruin distinctness    Let’s say you can surmount the challenges above. You are still faced with a problem: How do you transfer your virginal or distinct coins to a buyer? You could mine directly into a single-use device encoding a private key, like an Opendime, but that exposes your keys to hardware risk. Once you have virgin coins, they aren’t good for many transactions, as the taint theory holds that the more on-chain transactions occur, the more risk is introduced into the coins themselves.      If you wanted to actually transfer private keys without making an on-chain transfer, you could use a complex system like statechains. But those are still incipient and largely untested. The lack of a transaction history, which gives virgin coins their strength, is also a drawback. When it comes time to actually use these virgin coins, you are hamstrung. Moving them is to impair their distinguishing qualities.    There is no coin    More abstractly, individual units of Bitcoin don’t really have persistence the way that many think they do. Bitcoin is a UTXO system, which means that the Bitcoin protocol tracks quantities rather than specific units of Bitcoin. UTXOs should be understood as containers that hold varying amounts of Bitcoin. When they are spent, those containers are consumed and the quantities therein are passed on into new UTXOs. Think of it like pouring water from four glasses into six – the amount of water is the same, but you have no way of knowing which atoms from which originating glass ended up where.      Bitcoin’s predecessor, David Chaum’s Digicash, by contrast, was a genuine cash-like system, in that individual units actually had persistence. Digicash tracked individual ""bills"" with the equivalent of serial codes, in predetermined and fixed denominations. Like with regular cash transactions, to hit a specific threshold for an expenditure, you would have to select the bills of the right sizes (or receive change).    Read more: Nic Carter: The Frustrating, Maddening, All-Consuming Bitcoin Energy Debate    Bitcoin, by contrast, has no fixed denomination, and units have no persistence. UTXOs are consumed with each transaction. You cannot track a specific quantity of bitcoin through a coinjoin transaction with 50 inputs and 50 outputs; it’s like bars of gold being melted down and re-formed with each transfer. Bitcoin is interested in making sure users spend no more than the funds they are entitled to spend, but it doesn’t really care to identify the units being spent. Philosopher Craig Warmke clearly makes this case in his paper Electronic Coins.      Thus, even if certain coins are dubbed conflict-free, renewable-mined or virginal, these specific units lose their identity once they actually begin to circulate on chain. Virgin coins might better be called sterile coins – they are largely impotent and cannot actually circulate. The moment they do, and get inserted into the chaotic mélange of churning Bitcoin UTXOs, they become just another undifferentiated quantity of Bitcoin.    Read more: ‘Shark Tank’ Star: Wall Street Investors Need to Know How Their BTC Is Mined    A more foolproof way to acquire clean coins would be to appeal to a higher authority with the power to rid them of their taint. Historically, the blockchain’s version of John the Baptist is no other than the U.S. government. When the government sells seized Bitcoin in the U.S. Marshall’s Auction, there’s no question as to the authenticity, origin and credibility of the coins. Your counterpart is the U.S. government, after all. Thus, the seized Silk Road coins that Tim Draper purchased from the state are the cleanest of all.

The bank is readying an action plan so it will be prepared should the benefits of issuing a national digital currency outweigh the costs and potential risks, the central bank said Tuesday.  It believes a CBDC would allow a payment system that could adapt to a digital economy, as well as create an efficient and inexpensive infrastructure for cross-border payments.  The central bank further called for comments on its draft model, which it said does not represent any decision regarding the currency's characteristics, but is merely the basis for a discussion.  The Bank of Israel has been discussing a CBDC since 2017.  Elsewhere, Sweden's Riksbank and the European Central Bank are actively researching and developing their own digital currencies in preparation for expected launches in the next four to five years.  The U.S. Federal Reserve is taking a more cautious approach and carrying out experiments with no firm commitment to date.  Then there's China, which is reportedly close to the launch of its digital yuan and is already testing the CBDC with commercial institutions and the public.

42386735,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUhuZ,1620739800,State of Crypto: Gary Gensler's Regulatory Clarity Sounds Awfully Familiar,"SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s been on the job for three weeks. He’s just revealed what increased regulatory clarity might look like for crypto.    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Regulating crypto?  The narrative    Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler, three weeks into the job, said the U.S. Congress could help protect cryptocurrency investors by drafting some laws around crypto exchange regulation, noting the current, limited jurisdiction of the SEC.      “I think that this market, which is close to $2 trillion, [this] crypto asset market is one that could benefit from greater investor protection,” he said.    “I think if [Congress were to take action] – because right now the exchanges trading in these crypto assets do not have a regulatory framework, either at the SEC, or our sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – that could instill greater confidence. Right now there's not a market regulator around these crypto exchanges, and thus there’s really no protection against fraud or manipulation.”  Why it matters    Okay, some thoughts. First off, a (HUGE!) caveat that this is all speculation on my part.      With that out of the way, the entirety of the crypto industry’s support of Gensler comes from the idea that he understands crypto in a way his predecessor did not, and that this would lead to regulatory clarity. We now have a hint of how Gensler thinks he can provide this clarity. Any number of issues pertinent to the crypto industry will depend on how the U.S.’ regulatory framework develops, including whether a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is approved and how retail investors can tap the crypto market. The question becomes: Will Congress act with Gensler’s backing?    Breaking it down    What we don’t know are the specifics. There’s no concrete SEC or CFTC framework from Gensler right now. What we do know is that he thinks one of these agencies should have clearer oversight authority to address possible fraud or manipulation around the cryptocurrency markets.      Of course, exchanges are regulated right now at the state level. There are problems with this, though. For one thing, an exchange must secure money transmitter licenses in every state where it wants to operate (except Montana, which doesn’t have a licensing regime), which takes money and time. I’m not sure whether Gensler’s proposed federal framework would supersede the state-by-state approach, but if it did, does that would be massive. It’s the same problem that former Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks (now Binance.US CEO) tried to address with a federal trust charter to crypto companies. (While a few crypto custodians now have trust charters, it remains to be seen whether any exchanges will receive one.)      Both the SEC and CFTC have also demonstrated their oversight of the crypto markets with enforcement actions, but it sounds like Gensler’s going for something bigger. Though the CFTC has also laid claim to a number of crypto spot markets, there’s questions as to whether it actually has the authority to do so. So, in essence, it appears that what Gensler wants is some form of codified confirmation that a federal agency has oversight jurisdiction over the crypto markets in the U.S.      Here’s the next thing: We’ve seen this type of proposal in Congress already. Rep. Michael Conaway (R-Texas) introduced the Digital Commodity Exchange Act in the House of Representatives last year before he retired. That bill outlined how digital currencies could be treated similarly to commodities under federal law and, more importantly, it would create a federal jurisdiction for crypto exchanges.      To the best of my knowledge, there are no immediate plans to reintroduce the DCEA but it does seem like Gensler’s first recommendation has a frame all ready to go if someone in Congress does want to act on it. It could also, if passed, have a somewhat more immediate impact than the Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act, sponsored by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who asked Gensler about digital asset regulation. McHenry’s bill, which has been passed by the entire House, would form a working group that studies the issue sends Congress recommendations after a year, versus the DCEA, which would skip the study aspect.      This extends beyond just the possible impact on exchanges. If Gensler believes the crypto industry in the U.S. needs more oversight, and in particular is concerned about market manipulation on exchanges, that might mean regulated products dependent on trustworthy exchanges won’t be approved before that oversight is in place.      Market manipulation, after all, is an issue the SEC has brought up repeatedly in denying approval of bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. As Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted, Gensler may want this oversight to be formalized into law before an ETF is approved.      The possible downside I see here is if a new federal regulatory framework comes on top of the existing state-by-state regime. That would just become an additional burden on exchanges. There’s also the risk a federal framework would benefit larger, more established exchanges and become too difficult for smaller competitors to match, which would lead to some consolidation. The DCEA, as envisioned last year, would offer exchanges a choice of federal or state regimes to follow, so theoretically it wouldn’t result in a greater burden or consolidation.      I don’t know whether Gensler’s first public comments on crypto as SEC chair are a positive or negative sign for the industry. My view on Gensler’s nomination and confirmation has always been that he is likely to provide regulatory clarity, but it may not necessarily be the type of regulatory clarity the industry wants. That being said, my impression so far is that if Congress gets together and acts on this recommendation, this will be a long-term positive, both by giving exchanges some of that clarity they want and by giving retail or institutional investors more comfort about how their assets are regulated.    Fed accounts    Last Wednesday, the Federal Reserve published a proposal to allow financial institutions with novel banking charters access to accounts and services offered by the Fed. In other words, non-traditional financial institutions – like, say, crypto exchanges with certain charters – would be able to tap the Fed directly for an account rather than have to go through an intermediary bank.      If finalized (there’s currently a 60-day comment period on the proposal), the rule would mean entities like Wyoming-licensed Special Purpose Depository Institutions would be one step closer to acting as a full bank native to the crypto industry.      “The payments landscape is evolving rapidly as technological progress and other factors are leading to both the introduction of new financial products and services and to different ways of providing traditional banking services (i.e., payments, deposit-taking, and lending). Relatedly, there has been a recent uptick in novel charter types being authorized or considered across the country and, as a result, the Reserve Banks are receiving an increasing number of inquiries and requests for access to accounts and services from novel institutions,” according to the 20-page proposal.      David Kinitsky, the CEO of Kraken Bank, one such Wyoming-chartered bank, told CoinDesk his company had already applied for an account with the Fed, meaning this proposal is “of vital importance to us.”      The fact the Fed has taken the step of publishing this proposal is a good sign in and of itself, he said.      “We’re stoked about how they’re approaching it, with a risk-based approach,” he said. “There's nothing novel in terms of the factors that they're including here. It's exactly the type of things that the Federal Reserve is looking at, in terms of risk to the reserve itself, risk to the payment system [and] risk to the economy.”      In other words, fintech or crypto platforms won’t have to jump through extra hoops simply because they’re within the fintech or crypto industries.      Kraken Bank intends to maintain full reserves for the assets it holds rather than operate any fractional lending services or otherwise engage in fractional banking, Kinitsky said.      This means the liquidity and solvency risks that other banks might face aren’t an issue for Kraken Bank, he said. Kraken Bank does not intend to apply for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance at this time for that reason.      That’s not to say the Fed is comparing these alternate-charter institutions to banks. In Kinitsky’s view, the U.S. central bank is trying to determine how best to evaluate novel financial institutions in their own right.      “I think it's a really positive acknowledgement of the validity of some of these alternative charters that are eligible,” Kinitsky said. “... We don't want big banks to be gatekeepers, in effect, for them through banking as a service platform. It’s super, super important. It keeps us up to speed with other kinds of global regions like the U.K. faster payments initiative.”    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    On Friday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced Michael Hsu would be taking over as the Acting Comptroller at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, effective Monday. Hsu comes from the Federal Reserve, where he was a part of the bank supervision division, so he’s got experience overseeing major financial institutions. I’m not sure if he has any crypto background or where he’ll take former Comptroller Brian Brooks’ work from the past year. I’m also not sure if Hsu will eventually be nominated to become the full comptroller.      Has anyone heard anything about the CFTC?

Outside CoinDesk:  (The Washington Post) The U.S. Department of Justice sought and acquired subpoenas to obtain the phone records of three Washington Post reporters last year. The DOJ said it was looking for anything related to classified information that the reporters covered, and specifically for the reporters’ sources. It sure looks like it was just going after these reporters for publishing information that was less than great for then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. I have to say, as a reporter who occasionally talks to sources about sensitive information, this is really concerning. I can’t see this doing anything other than furthering a move to encrypted chat applications (P.S.: I’m on Signal).  (Yahoo Finance) U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said that “there’s a real issue about the environmental impact” of cryptocurrencies, in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Andy Serwer.

42386730,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUhoH,1620738000,IRS Taps TaxBit to Audit Bulk Crypto Transactions,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has contracted with crypto tax service provider TaxBit to help the U.S. tax agency audit entities and individuals.      Utah-based TaxBit announced the one-year contract Tuesday, saying it would provide auditing services for cryptocurrency transactions as needed by the IRS, helping the agency verify whether high-volume traders accurately reported their crypto taxes. The company just raised $100 million in a Series A funding round.      “We'll be providing data analysis and support and calculations for the IRS to help them really get to the right answer,” said Seth Wilks, TaxBit’s director of government relations. “[We’ll fill] some of the gaps in tools that just don't exist right now within their own ecosystem, and so we're coming in to make sure that they are fully understanding the data.”      The IRS will not be specifically auditing TaxBit customers with the contract. Rather, the federal agency will provide its own data and ask Taxbit to analyze the transactions as part of this contract.      Nor are these crypto-specific audits, Wilks said. The IRS audits a number of entities and people every year, initiating some of these examinations through a random selection of taxpayers and others based on red flags. When these audits include cryptocurrency transactions, the IRS will tap TaxBit to conduct any necessary analysis.      In other words, the IRS may not even be alleging wrongdoing or tax evasion for some of these audits.      While Wilks said he could not share specific details about the contract, he did say TaxBit would likely be examining high-volume entities or traders, who report thousands or millions of transactions per year.      “Those are more high-net-worth individuals or investment funds,” he said. “The typical everyday investor … we won’t see them.”      TaxBit will use its platform, which it’s been building out for three years, to aggregate and normalize any inputted data before automatically calculating the gains and losses. This data can come from different exchanges or wallets.      The rest of the TaxBit team may be tasked with looking for missing transactions or verifying that all the transactions that should be reported are filed (in the U.S., every crypto sale or transfer creates a taxable event).      “We see our role as, number one, [being] very unbiased, ... [W]e're just here to help get it right,” Wilks said. “But also, the report that we're providing to the IRS will be provided to the taxpayers as well, so it will help them. To an [extent] that they forgot to provide something or [are] missing information, they have an opportunity to rectify that and provide it.”      The challenge for the IRS is that while some exchanges and individuals file specific forms to the agency, others just provide a CSV file with transaction data.      In Wilks’ view, the move indicates a growing regulatory understanding that crypto is here to stay.      “They're seeing more and more people who are filing crypto,” he said of the IRS, “which means that in their random audit selections they're going to see more people reporting cryptocurrency.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/11/irs-taps-taxbit-to-audit-bulk-crypto-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c0ef2656a1e0a3200c023d85d554959d1214c64a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau rated the stock in a note Monday, according to a CNBC report, setting a 12–18-month target of $434 per share, up 48% from the close around $293.  Lau noted Coinbase should benefit from cryptocurrency’s ability to ease financial issues such as cross-border payments and access to banking, CNBC said.  “We view COIN as an enabler of crypto innovation which solves some pain points in the existing financial system while leveraging its trading arm to monetize the success,” Lau said.

42386734,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUhtJ,1620732168,DeFi Is Not TradFi: Why FATF's Guidance Would Stifle Growth,"Recently, I had the privilege of presenting to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on why its updated guidance regarding decentralized finance is not technologically appropriate for the industry.    Rebecca Rettig is general counsel at the Aave companies, the software development team that developed the Aave protocol. She will be speaking at Consensus by CoinDesk, our virtual experience May 24-27. Register here.    According to the FATF, the guidance was intended to provide additional “instruction” in light of the ongoing changes in technology in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Although the FATF said it does not intend to broaden the existing definition of virtual asset service provider (VASP) from its original guidance, the latest draft appears to vastly expand who or what may be included. More individuals and entities could be VASPs. And there may be individuals subject to the compliance requirements for running DeFi protocols (unlike today).      That expansion will capture numerous individuals and entities associated with the decentralized finance (“DeFi”) ecosystem. But adopting the guidance in its current form will capture actors who have little to no involvement in the financial transactions that occur on DeFi protocols.      Not only is that detrimental to the growth of an open and transparent financial system, but it is not proportionate to the money laundering and terrorist financing concerns based on available data.    Read more: FATF’s New Guidance Takes Aim at DeFi    In my presentation, I argued that rather than adopting the guidance in its current form, the FATF should adopt the following three interim steps toward achieving guidance that properly “plugs in” to the DeFi technological infrastructure: The FATF should take additional time for consideration of guidance that is aligned with the reality of DeFi technology and ecosystem; it should collaborate with industry participants and should realize that existing, native anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing (CFT) compliance solutions could be enhanced to offer a path forward.    DeFi vs TradFi    To understand why the guidance as drafted could cause irreparable harm to the DeFi industry, it is important to understand the meaningful differences between DeFi and the traditional financial system. Those differences require a fundamental paradigm shift in how we think about regulation and the monitoring of DeFi transactions.      In essence, there are five qualities of DeFi protocols that make them distinct from traditional financial systems – and more akin to the blockchains upon which they are built (and which FATF recognizes are not VASPs).    Transparent: Because DeFi protocols are built on blockchains – typically Ethereum – every single transaction that occurs through a DeFi protocol can be surveilled. Unlike information in the traditional financial system, DeFi transactions can be seen in real time and the information is available 24-7 to anyone with an internet connection anywhere in the world. That transparency enhances the ability for risk assessment of the protocol and the transactions.  Autonomous: Once a party initiates a transaction on a DeFi protocol, the transaction occurs automatically through smart contracts. No one – including the software developers – needs to approve, be involved in or otherwise engage with a party conducting a DeFi transaction, just as Satoshi Nakamoto is not involved in every bitcoin transaction.  Trustless: Transactions on DeFi protocols do not require reliance on any intermediary because of their automaticity. Individuals or entities interact with DeFi protocols through their own network addresses of which they are in full control.  Permissionless: Any party can access DeFi protocols from anywhere with an internet connection. There are no “minimum requirements” for DeFi, which provides an opportunity to enfranchise previously marginalized demographics. Individuals who don't have access to traditional financial institutions (for a number of reasons) are able to gain financial autonomy by engaging in transactions on DeFi protocols, which only requires access to the internet.  Non-custodial: No party, other than the user, exercises control over any virtual assets supplied to the protocol. Smart contracts, in nobody’s control, hold the virtual assets, and users make the decisions on what to do with those virtual assets. That eliminates counterparty risk: A user interacts directly with software rather than with another user.    It is clear from these characteristics that DeFi protocols are as “decentralized” as the blockchains upon which they are built.      In a truly decentralized system, it is not the software developers who built the protocol who make the decisions about the growth and development of the protocol. Unlike traditional finance where control is concentrated in one body, “decentralization” occurs where software empowers a community of users, developers and other entities interacting with the protocol to update or amend various parts of the protocol. This system of control by users is known as “decentralized governance.”      Decentralized governance allows for more secure systems, where users have a stake in seeing the system grow, and meets the needs of individuals everywhere in the world. In this context, these protocols are similar to the Internet Protocol and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol – IP and HTTP – which nobody controls and anyone can use and whose technical decisions are made by consensus.      The transparency of DeFi protocols addresses the AML/CFT concerns underlying the FATF’s proposed guidance. Preventing money laundering and terrorist financing is critical as we progress in the development of the DeFi space. But the inherent features of DeFi and the existing compliance solutions are already addressing such concerns.      A report issued by Chainalysis found that illicit virtual asset transactions make up only 1.1% of total virtual asset transactions. The same report, however, recognized that the transparency of blockchains also allowed law enforcement greater insight into cryptocurrency transactions, including money laundering.      In 2019, former U.S. Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo discussed the 2008 financial crisis and recognized the benefits of the transparency of the “real-time trading ledger” of blockchain.    “In short, what a difference it would have made a decade ago if Blockchain technology had been the informational foundation of Wall Street’s derivatives exposures. At a minimum, it would certainly have allowed for far prompter, better-informed, and more calibrated regulatory intervention instead of the disorganized response that unfortunately ensued,” he said.    While in private practice, I experienced firsthand the “better informed” regulatory intervention Giancarlo envisioned. In interacting with law enforcement and regulators in a variety of contexts, I was able to demonstrate that given the transparency of blockchain and the DeFi protocols built upon that technology, law enforcement and regulators had the exact same information about transactions on a DeFi protocol as the companies that built the protocols. In these situations, law enforcement is often able to obtain more information than they would have in the traditional financial system.    Read more: Crypto ‘Gray’ Markets Could Be Unintended Consequence of FATF Travel Rule  Room to breathe    Rather than starting with the premise that DeFi is working toward a greater good – a more transparent, efficient and inclusive financial system – the proposed FATF guidance reads as if the FATF has concluded DeFi is “guilty” or primarily built for criminals. That is wrong, and akin to the assumption made 25 years ago about the internet, when U.S. regulators almost strangled the internet in its cradle in order to target online pornography.      Beyond the presumption of guilt being factually incorrect, adopting the expansive definition of VASP in the proposed guidance would undermine the benefits of DeFi by stifling innovation, slowing economic growth, suppressing financial inclusion and perpetuating the wealth gap.      In addition, the presumption of guilt discourages collaboration from or with even the most willing industry participants. But collaboration is precisely what we need to continue to grow this new financial system while ensuring that AML/CFT compliance solutions “plug in” to the technology appropriately.      The proposed guidance reads as if we cannot have a financial system or a financial transaction without an intermediary. Thst sets a dangerous precedent: It sends the message that innovation is unwelcome unless it can be understood and regulated exactly as it is today.    Read more: Rick McDonell – Crypto Must Apply Safety Lessons of the Existing Financial System    The presumption of “guilt” is particularly troubling given the fact that developers of and participants in DeFi protocols have been developing solutions to AML/CFT as the DeFi ecosystem itself develops. These native compliance solutions account for the reality of blockchains and DeFi protocols: They “plug in” to them correctly, they account for the ways in which the software can be accessed, and they are building with the software rather than against it.      Some examples of the types of solutions that mimic the monitoring the proposed guidance seeks to promulgate are:    On and Off Ramps Into DeFi: Initially, users can interact with DeFi protocols only if they hold virtual assets, and the primary way to obtain virtual assets these days is through “on and off ramps” – centralized actors that sell or otherwise exchange fiat currency for VAs and who are undoubtedly VASPs. Those centralized actors all conduct Know Your Customer (“KYC”) checks on anyone conducting a transaction on their platform. These on/off ramps are typically regulated as money transmitters and must comply with stringent requirements in onboarding any users. These days, it is nearly impossible to use crypto without first having been KYC’ed by any number of platforms. In other words, DeFi is a “closed system” because a user cannot enter or exit it without having undergone KYC.  Transaction Monitoring: Once users hold crypto assets, they will access DeFi protocols in one of two ways: through user interfaces--websites on the internet accessible by anyone – or directly via a blockchain. These user interfaces can be hosted by the software developers who created the protocol or by third parties who have no affiliation with the developers. Many of these user interfaces employ transaction-monitoring companies such as Chainalysis, Elliptic, TRM Labs or Elementus to keep an eye on the wallet addresses interacting with the interfaces. These companies are able to identify wallet addresses associated with illicit activity or otherwise qualify as high risk and provide notifications about such wallets. For any transactions that occur directly on Ethereum, there is no way to block or prevent such transactions in advance, as is the case with cash transactions in fiat. But given the transparency of blockchain technology, such transactions can always be traced in a much easier fashion than cash transactions in fiat currency.    The current AML/CFT solutions in DeFi are robust and continuously getting stronger, especially considering that DeFi is a nascent, emerging financial system.      We need to embrace the benefits of AML/CFT regulations, but the proposed guidance will not provide such benefits and will simultaneously impose significant burdens (most of which cannot realistically be implemented) on this new financial system.

42386715,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUeXj,1620727820,Bitcoin Pullback Risk Rises as Whales Resume Selling,"Bitcoin's short-term prospects are looking a little bleak, with blockchain data pointing to renewed selling by ""whales"" – large investors with the ability to influence markets.    The number of whale entities – clusters of wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 bitcoin – fell to a 5.5-month low of 1,943 on Monday, according to data provided by Glassnode.  The metric has dropped by 60, or 3%, in the past five days, extending the decline from a record high of 2,237 on Feb. 7. Whale selling had eased off in the second half of April.  ""The data looks bearish, as it shows a clear trend of whales offloading their holdings,"" said Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange.  From October 2020 to February 2021, the number of whale entities had risen in lockstep with bitcoin's price, validating the narrative that the rally over that period was the product of increased participation by large investors.  Hence, the divergence between the two metrics is a cause for concern for the bulls.  Bitcoin's price has been generally restricted to the $50,000 to $60,000 range since mid-March amid continued selling by whales. In other words, retail investors alone have been struggling to drive the rally.  Recent market-wide price action suggests investor focus has shifted from bitcoin to ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).  While ether has more than doubled to record highs above $4,100 in the past two weeks, bitcoin has remained comatose below $60,000 and looks vulnerable to a deeper drop unless whales resume buying.  Balani predicted a notable correction below $50,000 in the short term. ""Monday's move was quite confirmatory of the impending drop,"" he said.  Bitcoin fell by over 5% to $53,500 on Monday, putting brakes on the rally in ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies. Ether closed Monday on a flat note at $3,950.

42386703,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUeEr,1620722404,Indonesia Considers Levying Tax on Crypto Profits,"Indonesia is considering a plan to tax profits on crypto trading in response to its increasing popularity.    Neilmaldrin Noor, an Indonesian tax official, said Tuesday that the country is examining ways to bolster tax revenue amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Reuters reported.  “If there is a profit or capital gain generated from a transaction, the profit is an object of income tax,” Neilmaldrin said.  The country’s central bank announced in January 2018 that crypto is “not a legitimate instrument of payment,” though trading is permitted.  There are 4.45 million crypto investors in the country, more than twice the number of equity investors, according to Indonesia's commodity futures trading regulatory agency, Bappebti.

42415768,WkWFu5l5TZXnF1B32UXNwH,1620720247,Bloomberg Analyst 'Optimistic' on US Bitcoin ETF This Year,"A bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. could be in the cards this year.  That's according to Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.  ""The institutional adoption of crypto is much greater,"" Balchunas said when asked why he thought this year was different to bitcoin's last bull run in 2017 and 2018. ""You have the intense growth of ‘default’ crypto products like (Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust) which are not ideal for retail investors and the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) knows this.""  ETFs operate in a similar fashion to mutual funds, but can be bought and sold throughout the daily trading period on exchanges like stocks. Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group.  Balchunas also pointed to Canada, which approved its first bitcoin ETF in February. At the time, he noted that the approval in Canada was a ""good sign"" the U.S. would follow suit.  So far, Canadian financial regulators have approved four bitcoin ETFs. By comparison, the U.S. has yet to approve an ETF for any cryptocurrency despite multiple applications spanning a number of years.  ""Canada has a history of being like six months to a year ahead of the U.S.,"" Balchunas said.  The Canadian ETFs have done well. Balchunas labeled the demand from investors as ""insane."" Within the first two days of trading of Purpose Investment’s ETF, Canada's first crypto ETF, the fund collected over $420 million in assets under management. All four ETFs have garnered $2.3 billion in assets in just three months, he added.  Balchunas also pointed to Gary Gensler being appointed as chairman of the SEC. He came to the SEC with experience in fintech and a presumably favorable stance toward crypto because he taught classes on crypto at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Still, Balchunas said that Gensler may have other priorities, given the Robinhood/GameStop debacle earlier this year, which could lead to a delay in a bitcoin ETF being approved. (Robinhood, a trading app, froze trading in GameStop's stock on Jan. 28, a move that drew the attention of regulators, who were concernd that the halt hurt the retail investos who typically use the app.)  But, Balchunas said, ""the longer they delay, the more they will effectively play kingmaker as whoever is out first is instantly wealthy. So I think there's a risk of waiting too long, and I think they understand that.""  According to Balchunas, there’s been a ""shift"" this year, meaning his team is ""more optimistic of an approval than we’ve ever been.""
