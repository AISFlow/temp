3857155,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=504910,1664927340,Polygon (MATIC) Leads Gains Amidst Market Uncertainty,"Polygon, the popular Ethereum layer-2 solution, has bagged substantial gains amidst a bearish market. Over the past 24 hours, Polygon has achieved a strong performance, recording a 4.37% gain at $0.833. The L2 protocol&apos;s market valuation of $7.07 billion places it back in the top 12, above both DAI and Shiba Inu. Compared to its all-time high of $ 2.68 in December &apos;21, MATIC is down by roughly 73% at its present pricing. However, the same factors that contributed to Polygon&apos;s fall also hampered the performance of cryptocurrencies during 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounce Coincides With Possible Macro Reversal | BTCUSD Analysis October 4, 2022 What Polygon Has Been Up To These Summer Months The entire crypto market faces bearish trends during the summer months, and Polygon was no exception. Looking at the daily data for Polygon, we can see that it hit a low of $0.313 in June. It rebounded from that low by more than 240% to reach $1 again in just two months. The price eventually found support in the region of $1. This is where the 50% Fibonacci retracement level supplied by the bearish vector it controls passes. This level was calculated using data ranging from the highs of $1.75 in March to the lows of $0.31. Zoom in on the previous few weeks. We can see that $ 0.69 has been a crucial supporting region for MATIC throughout. The price has since bounced back up.

However, this has not stopped the development that has been going on behind the scenes, and now SHIB developers have begun to share the products that they have been working on. These, and others, have shown a promising future for the digital asset, but some show some possible upside for SHIB this week. A Game, A Whale, And A Burn The past week has been an interesting one for Shiba Inu. First, lead Shiba Inu developers announced that the SHIB Eternity game was complete and is now being tested by users. The game has been made available to community members in Vietnam and Australia, some of whom have taken to Twitter to share their experiences with the game. So far, the reviews have been good, and SHIB Eternity is set to be available for general download on Thursday.

The leading crypto was seen at the doors of $20,000 last Wednesday, going up to $20,200. However, it quickly dropped, ending the trading day at $19,042, a 0.49% loss from its starting price. Throughout the week, Bitcoin has tested support levels over $20k but failed to hold on to them. But as of writing, it has broken the resistance and is now trading at $20,370, a 4.8% 24-hour increase.

Following the merge, the supply of ETH has almost become deflationary, and, on top of that, staked ETH, which is a derivative of ETH, has become a yielding asset.This makes Ethereum the perfect &apos;commodity&apos; to hold during the next few years. It offers advantages over oil and gold and will perform well in both an inflationary/loose monetary and deflationary/tight monetary policy environment.Ethereum is the all-weather asset you&apos;ve been looking for.Ultra Sound MoneyAs we approached the merge, many began talking about Ethereum becoming &apos;ultra sound money&apos;. Sound money preserves the value of your wealth. Gold has traditionally performed this role quite well. In the case of Ethereum, we can talk about Ultra Sound Money because the supply will very likely become deflationary, which means ETH tokens could systematically increase in value.The reason Ethereum has become (almost) deflationary since the merge can be found in the change in rewards from mining to staking and the introduction of EIP-1559, which was part of the London Hard Fork.First off, EIP-1559 introduce...",POSITIVE,ETH,COMMODITY | ETH | FIAT | MINING | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4544697-ethereum-best-commodity-for-next-decade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png

42394675,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUvII,1664918794,Market Wrap: Markets Seem Hopeful the Fed Will Temper Rate Increases That Crushed Prices,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether rose on Tuesday, logging a second consecutive day of gains.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price advanced 2.8% on Tuesday, building on Monday’s 2.7% gain. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization got back above $20,000. Prices rose 0.57% during the 13:00 UTC (9 a.m. ET) hour, around the time the U.S. stock market opens. Trading volume was double what’s typical around then.  Ether’s (ETH) price increased 2.4% on moderate volume. Unlike BTC, ETH started the 13:00 UTC (9:00 a.m. ET) hour trading slightly negative. ETH’s daily correlation coefficient with BTC has subsided recently, declining to 0.76 from 0.95 on Sept. 28. (Readings of 1 show two prices are moving in lockstep.)  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently increased by 1.89%.  Economic Calendar: The number of job openings in the U.S. declined to 10.1 million in August, the lowest since June 2021, according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) published Tuesday. The figure had been estimated at 10.8 million.  This is significant for cryptocurrencies because the unexpectedly large decline could, in theory, prompt the Federal Reserve to pivot away from aggressive rate hikes to reductions sooner than expected.  U.S. Equities: Traditional stocks climbed for a second consecutive day, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 increased 2.8%, 3.3% and 3%, respectively.  Commodities: Energy markets rose again on Tuesday ahead of potential OPEC supply cuts, with WTI crude and European Brent crude, two widely watched measures of oil markets, increasing 3% and 3%, respectively. Natural gas prices rose 5.4%  In metals, copper futures, often viewed as a signal for economic growth, rose 2.6%, while gold, which is viewed as a haven, increased 1.8%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC rises, seemingly on hopes that the Federal Reserve will “pivot”  Crypto markets traded higher on Tuesday on what appears to be expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will pivot to a more accommodative monetary policy, lowering interest rates instead of raising them.  The Bank of England’s (BOE) announcement last week that it will begin to purchase bonds in unlimited quantities, injecting money into the economy rather than removing it, raised the possibility that the U.S. will follow suit.  Still, the CME FedWatch tool (which tracks the odds of Fed moves on rates via trading in derivatives markets) doesn’t really reflect that, assigning a 59% probability to the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee raising rates 0.75 percentage point, or 75 basis points, in November. The current probability is down from 62.5% before the BOE’s announcement.  On Tuesday, Fed Bank of New York President John Williams indicated that the bank still has “a significant ways to go,” adding that current monetary policy is not restricting growth.  Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard indicated on Friday that “monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time,” and that the Fed will avoid “pulling back prematurely.” Still she also acknowledged that the FOMC needs to be “attentive to financial vulnerabilities.”  Following the JOLTS report, markets appeared to be pricing in the possibility of lower rates.  The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) shows the dollar recently weakening. BTC and the DXY have maintained an inverse relationship since July.  Technically, the DXY has shown a slight tendency to react to overbought and oversold levels of the RSI (Relative Strength Index). The RSI is a momentum indicator, implying that an asset is overvalued when the level exceeds 70, and undervalued when it falls below 30.  On Sept. 27, the RSI for the DXY was 82 and has since retreated to its current neutral level of 44. Prices for the DXY declined 4%, while BTC rose 4.4% over the same timeframe.  Four recent RSI readings for DXY over 70 (Sept. 6, Sept. 1, Aug. 22 and July 14), showed subsequent seven-day DXY gains of .006%, 1.2%, 0.002% and 2%, respectively.  BTC traders must determine whether a lower DXY resulted from a shift in Fed expectations, or is a response to perceptions that the dollar is overbought, irrespective of the FOMC’s actions.  The BTC price increase appears to be less pronounced than the DXY decrease over the same time period, indicating an additional note of caution to trading these two assets in tandem.

42394672,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUvDN,1664917256,Three Arrows-Backed 'Starry Night' NFT Collection Moved to Gnosis Safe,"Starry Night Capital, a fund backed by bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, had its non-fungible tokens (NFT) moved to smart contract wallet Gnosis Safe, according to Nansen.ai.  Starry Night was set up by the doomed Singapore-based firm in August 2021 to act as an investment arm for digital collectibles following the early NFT boom. The fund partnered with well-known NFT collector Vincent Van Dough to assemble ""the world’s finest collection of CryptoArt,"" according to its now-defunct Twitter account. The fund's website has also since been pulled.  CoinDesk reported last year that Three Arrows' NFT wallets initially swooped up assets from popular collections like CryptoPunks and invested in multimillion-dollar artworks from artists including Dmitri Cherniak, with the goal of raising $100 million. In addition, the firm planned to launch an NFT educational portal and physical gallery.  Ultimately, Starry Night Capital moved its entire collection of 70 works onto NFT marketplace SuperRare, according to CoinMetrics researcher Kyle Waters, ahead of its June 2022 liquidation order. At the time, it was estimated to have spent more than $21 million building the collection.  According to Nansen.ai, NFTs previously collected by Starry Night have since been moved to a Gnosis Safe address, including a Pepe the Frog NFT Genesis, which sold in October 2021 for about $3.5 million; a Fidenza, which sold for about $1.1 million in November 2021; and several CryptoArt NFTs by XCOPY that sold at multiple points last year for around $5.5 million, among others.  The shifting of these assets into a Gnosis Safe is significant, given that the smart contract digital asset management platform requires multiple signatures to move assets – meaning, multiple team members need to approve each transaction in order for it to be executed. This method is helpful for companies that may have multiple owners of a digital portfolio and prevents any single party from running off with the funds inside.  As noted by CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds, it's difficult to value all of the NFTs in the Starry Night safe because different valuation tools use different metrics in their estimations. According to Nansen.ai, the portfolio of NFTs is worth about 625 ether (ETH), or about $846,431. In addition, it notes that about 89% of the NFTs in the collection have low liquidity, which it measures as less than 35 sales in the last seven days.  Teneo, the hedge fund's liquidator, confirmed in a statement that all Starry Night Capital NFTs ""have been accounted for and are in our possession or are being transferred to us.""  ""In an effort to preserve as much capital as possible, Vincent Van Dough has offered to assist with the eventual sale of all 3AC NFTs and will likely be working with us to oversee the disposal of these assets.""",NEUTRAL,ETH,ETH,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/04/three-arrows-backed-starry-night-nft-collection-moved-to-gnosis-safe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5bbb14e49e19de745cae21f4ef9dd147f97ba1e8-2115x1586.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421098,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZSg9,1664912794,'I'm a Crypto Guy': Why Steve Aoki Believes in Web3,"Steve Aoki knows revolutions. As a teenager, before he was old enough to drive a car, he belonged to a community of “punk and hardcore kids” who played loud music in their basements. “We’re like, this music’s not meant for everyone,” he says now. “But it’s meant for people who care.”  The kids kept playing their music. “We’re [bloody] serious, we’re dedicated,” Aoki says. “And every single person in that room is a contributor.” They were building something. And each of the kids, metaphorically speaking, “had to pick up the bricks, had to pick up the axes, had to pick up and contribute.”  So they built. They contributed. They ignored the doubters and they created. Now, decades later, Steve Aoki is at the forefront of the EDM revolution, easily one of the most recognizable and prolific DJs on the planet. And once again he’s feeling that revolutionary spirit. “Now I’m 44 and I’m like, holy [crap], I feel like I’m 14 again,” says the DJ.  His latest revolution is crypto. “I’m a crypto guy,” says Aoki. “I love crypto. I believe in it. It’s the future.” This is why you constantly see Aoki involved with Web3 projects, such as minting non-fungible tokens (NFT) or creating his own “A0K1VERSE” in the metaverse (including the just-launched “Steve Aoki’s Playhouse” in The Sandbox), and launching new leagues in Draft King’s Reignmaker crypto fantasy football. The man seems to be half music, half crypto.  In a wide-ranging interview, Aoki opens up about why Web3 will become “an inevitable way of communicating,” how he can collaborate on music with just about anyone (including maybe Elon Musk?), why he thinks the price of ether (ETH) could reach $15,000(!), and why the doubters of Web3 should “never underestimate a group of people that’s yelling for change.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  What was your first taste of crypto?  The end of 2017 is when I dove in. I put half a million into bitcoin and ether. I think bitcoin was at around $11,000, and then it shot up to $19,000 … and then it dropped to $3,000.  That’s a rough start.  When it was at $7,000 everyone’s jumping ship and they’re like, “This thing is going to zero.” I’m thinking, “If it’s going to zero, I’m the f**king captain of the Titanic, and I’m going down with this thing.”  And it went down to $4,000. I'm like, “Let’s hold on man. I’ll die with this boat.” I was going down with the f**king ship, man. I'm not a panic seller.  See also: Living as NFTs in the Metaverse | Opinion  What gave you that rock-solid confidence to Hodl?  I just look at the long-term future of crypto. Yes, other coins are gonna fall by the wayside. That’s how everything works. But crypto [at large] is not going to zero. The question I ask myself is, “Do I think the entire industry of crypto will go to zero, will not exist?” The answer, to me, is no. It's clearly going to exist. When will mainstream adoption happen? I don't know, but it's definitely not going to zero. The ship is not going down.  How’d you get into NFTs and other corners of crypto?  Well, there was the rise of all these altcoins and s**tcoins, and I got into them. I got into weird ones, like shiba [inu] and dogecoin, and I was early with GameStop. I was early with a lot of these things. I was following WallStreetBets [the Reddit forum]. I’m definitely a prospector, and I had the FOMO bug in general. With crypto, you put a little money into it and it’s fun because things are so volatile. It really is kind of like gambling.  Do you have a bit of a thrill-seeking, gambling streak in you?  You’d think I would because I’m an adrenaline junkie at heart. I like extreme sports like snowboarding and skydiving. I love this responsible chaos, where you’re in the middle of the whirlwind but you’re safe.  I love the phrase “responsible chaos.”  I had a taste of gambling in the casinos, and it ate me alive. I played blackjack and I love playing poker; I’ve been a poker player for 15, 20 years. But you can't beat the casino, so that's one thing I finally learned. And then I stopped. I do have fun doing prop bets [on sports] with friends; that’s just putting a little extra salt on the popcorn, if you will. It just adds to the game.  So what was your next crypto chapter? I’m guessing NFTs?  Yeah, and that chapter was a much deeper dive.  What is it about NFTs that you find so appealing?  NFTs are about identity, community and ownership. Those are things that really mean something to me.  And I'm a crypto guy. I love crypto. I believe in it. It’s the future, and it’s going to be an exchange people will always use. People believe in it, and I believe in it, so I’m gonna invest money into it.  But am I gonna put a bitcoin image on my [Twitter] profile? Am I gonna put an ether image on my profile? Never. Of course not.  See also: Why It Can Feel Good to Be Bad in the Metaverse | Opinion  Why is that?  It's cold. Although I agree with it, my heartstrings are unattached to it. I'm a collector of art. I love art. I love sports cards. I love the nostalgia of certain things. There are certain groups of things that I am passionate about. Like, I have a tattoo of a Jean-Michel Basquiat art piece on my arm. I'm not gonna get [a bitcoin symbol] on my arm, although some people would.  And some people might put a bitcoin image on their profile. But for me, I’d rather put art or my ReplicantX up on my Twitter profile. There’s a story behind it, something deeper. I need something that's gonna dive me into a world, the way some people dive into ""Dragon Ball"" or ""Rick and Morty"" or ""The Simpsons"" or whatever it is that they grew up with.  What else makes you bullish on NFTs?  NFTs and the metaverse are based on a proof of concept that already exists: We live in a digital space and it actually has a significant impact on our real life.  The fact that we get likes on Instagram, that we get views on TikTok or YouTube, these things matter to us a great deal. It might matter more than a pat on the back by a stranger. You follow me?  100%.  How many “followers” we have in these spaces has a significant impact on how we view ourselves. It's a large imprint of our identity to the world. And the metaverse is an extension of this.  The landscape of the way we interact socially and digitally is going to change in a couple of years, once the clunkiness of onboarding into Web3 gets smoothened out.  Everything you said about digital lives makes sense to me. But what is it about Web3, specifically, that resonates with you?  Take social media. I don’t have to argue that billions of people use it, and that's how we socially interact. This is the foundation and we all agree with that. But we also all agree that when we enter into social media we don't own the content. We hit the Accept button. Before you create your login on your Facebook or your Twitter or your TikTok, we’ve accepted the fact that Mark Zuckerberg or whoever is gonna own this stuff. It’s their rules, it’s their playground and we’re playing in their house.  This is how it works. We all accept it because there's no other alternative. But now we have an alternative. The alternative is Web3. In a few years’ time, if you tell people that you can interact in a place where you own your data, you own your content, and you dictate the terms – do you prefer that or do you want Mark Zuckerberg to own it? They're gonna give you a very simple answer. It's gonna be 100%.  The reason why people aren’t going over there yet is because they don’t understand how Web3 works, and because it’s a clunky onboarding and it’s scary. You hear about these hacks and people don't understand it. It's still new, right? But the philosophy of what ownership means in this space is really the basis of how it will become an inevitable way of communicating, socializing and buying, and selling and trading in the digital space.  Where does the metaverse fit into this?  Take gaming. There’s a multibillion-dollar industry in Fortnite and Call of Duty and all of these games. People buy “skins” [a form of upgrading their characters] in these games, and we all agree that it's okay to buy a skin and spend $20. And, guess what, it's owned by Epic Games [and other gaming companies]. And we’re okay with that because there's no alternative.  There will be an alternative where you could play the same game, but when you buy and sell skins you own them yourself.  What do you think it will take for digital ownership to go mainstream?  I mean, this is definitely a “people's voice” kind of movement. It’s not going to be a trickle-down situation where you have big institutions coming in, then everything is gonna change. They're not gonna come in right now. They're not gonna take the risk and they don't need to.  I think of the analogy of music. The most dominant form of music had always been the English language. That was irrefutable for a very long time.  But now the biggest artist in the world is Bad Bunny and he sings entirely in Spanish. You have KPop groups from a small country compared with the rest of the world, South Korea, and they’re dominating in music. They're dominating over English-singing artists. Why? It's not because the radio stations wanted to play it. It’s because the fans made sure it’s up there.  These are music communities that are so engaged and so strongly linked that they’re able to take over what the institution is controlling. They're like, “Nope, this is what people are listening to.” Because guess what, the streams matter, the views matter. It's not what the big radio stations want that matters.  It’s a great analogy.  I'm part of EDM culture dance music. We’ll never beat the big pop American kind of records. But we have a large share because we have so many fans in our community that demand that it's out there, that demand that we’re on the charts, that demand that it’s getting played. So I'm already part of that kind of movement.  And Web3 is that same kind of underdog, where we have a passionate small group of people. Never underestimate a group of people that’s yelling for change. Never underestimate them. If you do it long enough and you do it consistently enough it has an exponential reach.  Before I was even 16 I was part of a very small community of punk and hardcore kids. And we would make noise in our basements and living rooms. We’re like, “This music's not meant for everyone, but it's meant for people who care.” But we’re [very] serious and we’re dedicated.  Now I’m 44 and I'm like, “Holy [crap], I feel like I'm 14 again.” We're picking up the picks and axes and we're developing, we're building, we're creating a whole new world. We're the ones panning for gold together and we're building our own homes. We're doing this together, we're architecting together.  Let’s talk building. What’s your goal with building the A0K1VERSE? What kind of experiences are you trying to create?  It's a structured community. We’ve had a Discord for a long time, once I dropped my first NFT. There’s a real conversation happening. So we thought, we’re going to create our own Soho House, in a way. We’ll have these different levels, and at different levels you’ll get different benefits.  Because I'm an artist and creator, there are interesting things I could do with members of the community that I’ve never done before.  Such as bringing a member from the community to make a song with you, and actually release it on all DSPs [digital streaming platforms]. That's a pretty steep offer. That's the highest level, and it’s what we put in the A0K1VERSE. Three people actually reached it.  Wait, so did you actually record a song with someone from the A0K1VERSE?  We haven't done it yet. I’ll be working with these members in the studio and we'll be making music that will eventually come out.  How does that work? I mean they’re randos, right? Are you like, “I hope they don’t totally suck?”  This is one thing I’m proud to say without sounding, you know, self-inflated, but I’m probably one of the most cross-genre producers out there in the world. I just work with every genre. I'm not even talking about music. I go into science because I did a whole series called “Neon Future” and it was really important for me to get bona fide scientists on my albums, because I really believe in this future of AI merging with humans. I really believe in that. So every album had a scientist on it. Bill Nye [of “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV fame], he's not a musician as far as I know.  It’s not what he’s known for.  He's probably like, “Steve, don't say that.” I think he actually plays the saxophone or something. But I could be totally wrong.  I’ve also worked with J.J. Abrams, Kip Thorne and Ray Kurzweil. So there are a lot of different non-musicians I've worked with. I can work with anyone. Actually, the person I wanna be in the studio with the most – and I’m not saying he’s not a musician because he very well could be, because he’s an absolute genius – is Elon Musk. I don’t care if you can play a lick of an instrument or you have zero pitch; I don't give a damn. Just get in the studio and we're gonna have fun.  Hopefully, Musk reads this article and we’ll make it happen. So I get that the A0K1VERSE is a membership club, but how does the metaverse piece work?  The A0K1VERSE starts out with this social membership community and we're growing from that. The first layer of what our metaverse looks like is what we just dropped, called Sky Pods. They exist in this cloud world. We spent eight months working on Sky Pods (partnering with OnCyber) for the different levels of A0K1VERSE.  What are they exactly?  People can show their NFTs on a website and you don’t have to go to a wallet to watch it or go to OpenSea to watch it. There's a studio that's built in and there are all these different kinds of rooms. But this is just the first layer.  The Sandbox is the first metaverse world that's really making a dent. Their team is absolutely amazing to work with. With Steve Aoki’s Playhouse, there’s a quest where you can dive into my brain to the foam pit. It just gets insane. And we’re about to drop our own version of a waterpark.  Wait, how the hell do you create a waterpark in the metaverse?!  That's the whole point. Like, you can do absolutely anything and you can have fun. For people who ask, “Why would you even go in there?” my response is, “Do you know how many people grew up playing Sims? Do you know how many people played Minecraft?”  Fair. It’s a big number.  Do you know how many people love building in these worlds and playing in these kinds of games? There are millions upon millions upon millions. Millions of people played these games, building their own cities. This is basically that, but you own your character. You could sell your character, you could make quests and you can actually buy and sell and trade.  Read more: How to Make It in the Metaverse | Opinion  You’re also involved with DraftKings Reignmakers, crypto fantasy football. What got you into that?  It combines all these different elements that I love. I’m a big card junkie guy; I love sports cards. I have an insane sports card collection. If you follow me on Instagram Live, most likely you’re watching me break open a pack of football, basketball or soccer cards.  But instead of opening a [normal] pack, you’re opening up your own NFTs. They're cards that you own. And these cards are representative of your fantasy football team. So you own the NFTs, you can trade them on the open marketplace and then, of course, the end goal is killing it with your team and winning some prizes.  Any final predictions for the space?  For NFTs, the ride will be volatile in the next five years, for sure. People are gonna be wiser about creating communities, and it's not just about this quick money grab. The longer-play visions are the ones that survive. And I also agree with GaryVee, that 98% of NFTs are gonna fall off, just like what happens with every other industry.  For bitcoin, we're gonna go up to $100,000 in the next five years. And $15,000 ether in the next five years. I’m a big NFT guy. Everyone’s buying NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, and I think it has real utility. And you can’t knock bitcoin; bitcoin is power. I’ve invested in some other coins, but bitcoin and ether are my go-tos.  Thanks Steve, this was fun.

Daniel Leon resigned Tuesday. He is the latest executive to depart the company after now-former CEO Alex Mashinsky.  Leon is stepping down amid Celsius's ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, the Financial Times reported. Mashinsky resigned exactly a week ago. Celsius filed for bankruptcy in New York in July, and now faces an inquiry from an investigator appointed by the U.S. Trustee's office and authorized by the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.  Leon's departure was hinted at by YouTuber Tiffany Fong, who previously shared audio from two leaked all-hands meetings at the company. In one, Mashinsky and other executives proposed a custody-focused recovery plan, dubbed ""Kelvin."" In another, co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Nuke Goldstein suggested Celsius create ""IOU"" tokens for its customers.  The U.S. Trustee's office – and some Celsius creditors – have alleged the company has been less than forthcoming regarding its financial situation. The inquiry is intended to investigate these claims.  Earlier this month, the Financial Times also reported that Mashinsky withdrew about $10 million in crypto from the company in May – weeks before Celsius halted customer withdrawals and a little over a month before it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections.

42394669,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUvAQ,1664912321,Japan to Invest in Metaverse and NFT Expansion,"Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said in a policy speech on Monday that the country’s plans for investing in digital transformation include non-fungible tokens (NFT) and metaverse services.  The country has steadily been promoting investment in digital technology, including through tax incentives for companies that embrace a digital future. In his speech to Japan’s parliament, Kishida said the country will continue to focus on “supporting the social implementation of digital technology” and will “promote efforts to expand the use of Web3 services that utilize the metaverse and NFTs.”  Japan’s federal foray into Web3 follows a trend of officials taking strides to implement Web3-related services in the country – rather than following the typical bureaucratic route that policies must often travel through. Kishida’s administration recently established a Web3 policy office under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), which is focused on creating policies for the country’s gradual blockchain expansion.  In April, a task force launched by Kishida’s Liberal Democratic Party and led by politician Akihisa Shiozaki released an “NFT White Paper,” which called Web3 the “the new frontier of the digital economy” and outlined plans to advance the national strategy on Web3.  METI is also reportedly looking into a proposal to offer tax exemptions to Japanese crypto companies in order to entice them to keep their business in the country and further fuel the nation’s growing Web3 industry.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/04/japan-to-invest-in-metaverse-and-nft-expansion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82cd81f33c896f3823b6b8c276003bae51cbdd96-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This means developers should move their testing activities over to Goerli and Sepolia testnets as soon as possible.  Ethereum runs testnets for developers to test new software before launching it on Ethereum’s main network, or mainnet. Test networks are essentially copies of the Ethereum mainnet, and they allow developers to analyze any changes to their applications in a low-stakes environment before applying them.  Read more: Merge Testing on Ethereum: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?  The Ethereum Foundation announced that Ropsten would be ""deprecated"" in the fourth quarter of 2022, and Rinkeby would be phased out in the second quarter of 2023. However, infrastructure providers like Etherscan, which is one of the most-used block explorer and analytics platforms for the Ethereum blockchain, have the option to stop supporting the networks earlier.  Rinkeby did not go through a test Merge, though Ropsten did (meaning it transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake) on June 8, 2022. Users of these testnets will switch over to either the Sepolia or Goerli testnets.  The Sepolia and Goerli testnets also ran through their own test Merges over the summer.  “Sepolia and Goerli are considered the two testnets the ecosystem plans to support,” said Parithosh Jayanthi, a DevOps Engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, to CoinDesk. “Goerli has a relatively large dapp (decentralized applications) ecosystem and allows users to join the validator set in order to test their staking setups. Sepolia is a relatively new testnet and has a small state size, making it easy to use for experimentation,” Jayanthi added.  Ethereum’s mainnet Merge was successfully completed on Sept. 15.

42394673,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUvEM,1664908560,"With Crypto Governance in CFTC Crosshairs, SushiSwap Mulls Legal Shakeup","Popular decentralized crypto exchange SushiSwap is mulling a revamping of its legal structure, an effort with potentially greater potency amid increased regulatory scrutiny of crypto projects governed by so-called decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).  SushiSwap, whose DAO token holders decide on everything from leadership to artist grants, was advised this month to divvy itself up into a trio of legal entities based in Panama and the Cayman Islands. The new structure proposed by law firm Fenwick & West LLP would “mitigate risk,” according to a write-up posted Sept. 22 in SushiSwap’s governance forum.  Governing crypto trading infrastructure via such investment collectives has never been riskier. Last week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Ooki DAO for alleged violations of U.S. investment laws, seemingly targeting everyone who votes in that DAO – undermining the notion that “decentralization” can shield DAO members from liability.  The robust participation in Sushi DAO votes is, however, a stronger claim to decentralization than Ooki has ever seen, Nansen data shows. More than 1,800 individual wallets have voted in Sushi DAO in the past six months, compared with a mere nine in Ooki over the same period. That said, Sushi DAO’s clout pools around token heavyweights; crypto hedge fund Arca accounted for 29% of a July vote on collecting arbitrage profits, according to Nansen.  “Simply calling an unregistered group of individuals voting on governance a DAO isn't going to fly, and that's what the newest lawsuits target,” newly elected SushiSwap leader Jared Grey posted on the platform's Discord channel on Thursday. (He won the election to become “head chef” with 62% of votes coming from just two addresses.) “Currently, Sushi is unregistered and needs legal entity protection asap.”  A new leaf  Fenwick’s proposed legal structure marks the latest turn for a sometimes messy crypto investment collective that’s had more than its share of governance snafus and leadership shake-ups, including the ouster of former leader 0xMaki.  Read more: Sushi Tries to Pick Up the Pieces: A DeFi Governance Case Study  According to Neil Bhasin, a DAO member active in the Fenwick conversations, this effort marks a change of tone for SushiSwap. “I would like to see Sushi take a sophisticated approach to legal,” he said in a Telegram message. “Old Sushi would neglect a lot of things (not just legal and not necessarily in a malicious way, just lots to do) so perhaps turning a new leaf.”  SushiSwap’s “new leaf” was months in the making, said Bhasin, but it fell within hours of the CFTC’s lawsuit against Ooki DAO. That unprecedented action prompted key voices such as Grey to sharpen their calls for a legal wrapper that might protect SushiSwap from liability – and soon.  Turning those recommendations into reality will take time, Bhasin cautioned. Fenwick has proposed slicing SushiSwap into three entities: a Cayman Islands foundation to administer DAO assets, including its treasury and governance procedures; a Panamanian foundation to manage the on-chain trading infrastructure; and a Panamanian corporation to operate SushiSwap’s front end. This could take about a month to implement if and when the community votes to approve it.  That’s hardly a given. So far, community responses have ranged from demands for quick action to calls to go slow and digest the ramifications. Some were wary of disrupting “the crypto ethos” of unmitigated decentralized governance by introducing state-based legal entities subject to local laws. That debate is one that rages across decentralized finance (DeFi), with many DAOs opting to hand their reins to these corporations and foundations.  “TBH I really don’t think it’s possible to go full degen,” Bhasin said, referring to the DeFi purist route. “At some point you’re using some vendor that will lay down before a govt.”",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | ZRX,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/04/with-crypto-governance-in-cftc-crosshairs-sushiswap-exchange-mulls-legal-shakeup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df165b466b8bbd235a71800654a12d5a4ed7a821-4064x3048.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Zillow, home values in the US are up 18.2% year over year. Compare this to the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ Composite - which are down 16.7% and 25% respectively - and it becomes clear that real estate is holding up far better than most other assets. Investors have taken notice, and demand for real estate has never been higher — especially for fix and flip properties. In fact, houses are being flipped at a higher rate than any time in the last 20 years. And with good reason - according to ATTOM, the average house flip returns a gross profit of $67,000 and an ROI of 26%.

House flipping is when an investor buys a property, performs renovations, then re-sells it for a profit.

Earlier this week, the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star was ordered to pay a $1.26 million fine in settling charges filed by the SEC. The agency said she not only promoted EMAX to her millions of social media followers but didn't disclose the $250,000 payment she received for that promoting. In the settlement, where she did not admit wrongdoing, she agreed to cooperate with the SEC's ongoing investigation and not promote crypto assets for three years.  Read more: Kim Kardashian Settles SEC Probe for $1.26M for Hyping EthereumMax Without Disclosing Payment  “The chairman [Gary Gensler] is absolutely right to say there is a specific statute that addresses and requires that there be disclosure, not just of a paid promotion, but the amount that someone either has been paid or expects to be paid,” said Braganca, who now runs her own firm, Braganca Law.  “[T]hat's where [Kardashian] blew it,” she added, referring to the “#AD” tag placed at the bottom of Kardashian’s Instagram post. “It was pretty misleading.”  And while it “may seem strange” that the SEC is going after Kardashian, it could be a reminder that even celebrities aren’t immune to government authority, according to Braganca.  Read more: Kim Kardashian and EthereumMax. Why? / Opinion  The Kardashian token-tout debacle isn’t the first time the SEC has gone after celebrities promoting crypto as investments, she noted. In 2018, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. faced similar litigation after he promoted EMAX.  Now, however, the SEC could be showing “greater levels of irritation,” and is in search of “bigger penalties,” Braganca said.  As to why the SEC hasn’t gone after more token issuers, Braganca said the agency “doesn’t have to go after everyone,” and could just be going after “the low-hanging fruit.”  What the SEC is saying is it can have a big impact on the token issuers if it goes “after the influencers, and then we’ll get to the issuers eventually,” Braganca said.

42411358,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNIPw,1664901563,"Kim Kardashian, EthereumMax and the SEC's Publicity Grab","Monday, before the market opened, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it settled with celebrity influencer Kim Kardashian for $1.26 million related to her paid endorsement of a cryptocurrency called EthereumMax. Just as when Kardashian first shilled the token in June 2021 (and failed to disclose the $250,000 she was paid to do so), the news raises the question … why? Why did Kardashian get involved in the first place, and why is the SEC fining her now?  The SEC, under Chairman Gary Gensler, is looking to send a message: Celebrities should think twice before endorsing cryptocurrencies. Kardashian, a celebrity who has built her reputation on being famous as well as ubiquitous, is a high-profile target. With a federal agency that is consistently underfunded going after this big target, the settlement serves as a warning for the crypto industry at large.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But the news also comes amid a deep market rout, where every day brings more news of crimes swept under the rug during a FOMO-fueled market rally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three Arrows Capital, once thought to be one of the smartest hands in the game, was found to have built its fortune largely by rehypothecating borrowed funds. Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt “neo-bank” Celsius Network was just found to be siphoning funds from Celsius.  Figures like Mashinsky and Three Arrow’s Kyle Davies and Su Zhu promised much more than Kardashian and other celebrity crypto endorsers ever could. Celsius’ unofficial slogan was “unbank yourself.” The Three Arrows hedge fund operated under the idea of an unstoppable crypto “supercycle.” Until the firm imploded under the weight of bad debt and bad bets, Celsius promised users returns of up to 20% on their crypto holdings. Mashinsky is now selling T-shirts saying, “Unbankrupt Yourself.”  None of this is to excuse the role celebrities have played in pumping tokens like EthereumMax. Kardashian posted about the project on Instagram, where she had about 220 million followers at the time, making it the ""financial promotion with the single biggest audience reach in history,” according to outgoing U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Chairman Charles Randell. Further, Gen Zs’ second-most popular source for financial advice is social media, according to a CreditCards.com survey.  EMAX, as insiders call it, dropped over 99% after Kardashian’s plug (though the token spiked after her settlement, proving the adage that no press is bad press). Investors posting on the project’s Telegram and Discord have complained about slow progress on the EthereumMax’s project’s roadmap, which involved an online casino and social token that would get holders into red carpet events.  Kardashian’s fans have made the case that the Insta-famous influencer is being scapegoated. Her post, while failing to disclose the amount was paid, noted it was “not financial advice” and included the “#ad” hashtag. Several other celebrities, including boxer Floyd Mayweather, also endorsed EthereumMax. Nearly every celebrity-endorsed non-fungible token (NFT) project is in the doldrums, a Bloomberg investigation found. And figures like Ben McKenzie have built a second career as the movie industry’s superego, shaming his peers’ crypto offerings.  See also: 'Probably Nothing': Why People Still Hate Crypto | Opinion  “When a group of entrepreneurs is raising money from the public and the public’s anticipating a profit, they need … full, fair and truthful disclosure. And that’s the core bargain in our capital markets,” Gensler said. He added, specifically, Kardashian violated Section 17(b) of the Securities Act, a law passed in the 1930s. He has convincingly argued elsewhere that all cryptos operate like stocks or bonds, and should fall under his agency’s remit.  ""The SEC is always looking for a way to get the message out to the public ,and when somebody with the kind of following that Kim Kardashian has makes a blunder like this … that's a layup for the SEC,” Lisa Braganca, former SEC enforcement branch chief, said Tuesday on CoinDesk TV.  So what happens next? It’s likely Kardashian’s settlement will have a chilling effect on the industry, but it cannot stop the crypto “trash moat.” It’s simply too easy to fork an open-source project, pay for a little engagement or market making and sell the dream of “disruption” to retail investors. Kardashian, who did not admit wrongdoing, is participating in the SEC’s ongoing investigation into EthereumMax.  It’s also worth noting Kardashian’s settlement comes just weeks after the social media juggernaut announced she’s moving into the private equity industry. Her new business, called Skky Partners, which she co-founded with former Carlyle Group partner Jay Sammons, was touted by some financial pundits as a smart move at the time given the reality television star’s massive social influence.  Skky is looking to invest across the media, hospitality, luxury and digital commerce industries. But one thing is for sure: At least for the next three years as part of her SEC bargain, Kardashian likely won’t be promoting crypto. There was a time when Kardashian thought she could trade in a little social capital for financial gain, by promoting what in retrospect was clearly a rug pull. There’s a steeper barrier for her now, but maybe not for others.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/04/kim-kardashian-ethereummax-and-the-secs-publicity-grab,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b026cd839005693b31796d162e5baabad1411805-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416136,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZirn,1664901009,NFT Firm Seeks US Election Commission’s Approval to Market Campaign Souvenirs,"In the grand political tradition of campaign buttons – think “All the Way with LBJ” or “I Like Ike” – the crypto world is trying its own version, with a non-fungible token (NFT) firm seeking approval from the U.S. Federal Election Commission to offer souvenir tokens to political committees.  Data Vault Holdings is seeking an FEC stamp on its plan to market political NFTs to campaigns as an incentive for supporters. The digital items’ ownership – and the campaign supporter’s political sentiment – could be forever recorded on a blockchain. As an example, a $10 contribution might earn a specific level of token, while Data Vault takes $3 to process it.  “The NFT would be offered by the political committee with a focus on high-volume low-dollar donors consistent with the federal contribution limits,” according to the company’s FEC request. “The NFT could contain artwork, campaign literature, position papers and other campaign approved and compliant digital content including video, audio and interactive social media.”  The commission has previously favored campaigns issuing their own tokens, when a congressional candidate in Florida’s 2020 election asked for permission to hand out tokens to campaign workers. As long as they had no monetary value, the FEC ruled that “the distribution of valueless blockchain tokens is not a form of compensation for volunteers' services but rather a novel means for volunteers and supporters to show their support for the campaign.”  Based in East Brunswick, N.J., Data Vault has previously worked with other organizations to handle crypto technology on their behalf. In this case, it would be a paid vendor offering fundraising services to U.S. campaigns.  Campaigns have already been experimenting with NFTs in fundraising, such as when DeFi (decentralized-finance) developer Matt West used of cartoon beavers in his Oregon race, though he placed sixth in that Democratic primary earlier this year. Before that, Scott Jensen, a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Minnesota, released a ""Scott at the Fair!""

42411357,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNITF,1664898820,Can Starbucks Bring Web3 Into the Mainstream?,"For companies looking to dip a toe into Web3 – or take a cannonball plunge – it can be difficult to know where to start. Underlying technologies such as protocols, wallets and exchanges are still nascent compared with existing financial systems. New types of tokens are introduced on a seemingly daily basis. Web3 adoption has spiked over the past few years, but is still far behind the ubiquity of Web2. The industry has a long way to go to match the functionality of current systems, particularly for consumer purchases in developed economies with stable currencies. How long will it be until using crypto for a standard consumer purchase, such as buying a cup of coffee, is a joy rather than a gimmick?  Enter Starbucks. The launch of its new non-fungible token (NFT)-based reward program, Starbucks Odyssey, may bring us one step closer to making this a reality, or at least provide some suggestions of which direction to head in.  Stephanie Hurder is a founding economist at Prysm Group and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. Prysm Group Associate Brian Perry-Carrera also contributed to this column.  Early signs of smart design  Based on recent announcements, the program is very much still a work in progress, and the full details have yet to be revealed. But from what we know so far, Starbucks has made some promising decisions that can serve as guidance for other corporate Web3 initiatives.  First, Starbucks Odyssey is additive, not substitutive. Starbucks’ current reward program is arguably the most successful loyalty program in the world, with nearly 60 million rewards customers globally and 30 million in the U.S. alone. The loyalty program drives approximately 50% of all Starbucks revenue through incentivizing repeat business, upselling, and customer personalization. It would be quite a leap of faith for Starbucks to discard its wildly successful traditional rewards program and replace it with a Web3-based program, given the newness of the technology and the uncertain success of an NFT-based program. By making Starbucks Odyssey an optional, additional rewards program the firm is able to build on the existing program with complementary products, yet minimize risk to the cash cow, allowing for greater flexibility in the future should the dynamics around Web3 technology change.  Second, the program is an organic fit with key demographics. Starbucks’ largest customer segment is millennials between the ages of 25 to 40 – comprising 50% of the company’s business – with young adults ages 18 to 24 just behind. As the Starbucks brand matures and faces challenges such as labor disputes, rising supply chain costs and labor shortages, growing and retaining this customer base will be increasingly important.  See also: Why We Need to Build Web3 Differently | Opinion  NFTs, while still a very new technology, appeal to this target user base. The Gen Z demographic has the most investment experience and general interest in NFTs. The second-largest demographic of those invested or interested in NFTs are millennials, which, again, bodes well for Starbucks’ key consumer segments.  Third, all indications are that Starbucks will be using top-tier user interface/user experience (UI/UX) design to bridge the gap between NFT/blockchain natives and novices. Starbucks has seen tremendous success with its Mobile Order and Pay functionality, in part due to its seamless UI/UX design. For the development of the Odyssey reward program, Starbucks has partnered with Forum3, led by co-founder Adam Brotman. Prior to co-founding the Web3 loyalty startup, Brotman was the chief digital officer at Starbucks who helped lead the design of the Mobile Order and Pay system. Based on this, it seems fair to assume that Starbucks Odyssey will aim to replicate the seamless experience that customers enjoy today.  Ironically, this may involve hiding many of the characteristics distinctive of Web3, at least in the short to medium term. Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Brady Brewer went as far to say: “It happens to be built on blockchain and Web3 technologies, but the customer – to be honest – may very well not even know that what they’re doing is interacting with blockchain technology.”  Moving beyond marketing  Starbucks Odyssey seems like a promising implementation of Web3 technology for today’s environment. However, harnessing the full potential of Web3 will require some difficult design decisions. Here are just a few that we anticipate:  Managing the impact of speculation: Starbucks announced it plans to allow NFT holders to trade them in peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces. As the gaming industry has learned, peer-to-peer trading of NFTs invites speculators, whose presence fundamentally alters the experience of organic users, often in a detrimental way. Starbucks will need to design marketplaces and other mechanisms to mitigate the impact of speculation and ensure the rewards program continues to provide the desired incentives.  Fully harnessing underlying Web3 technology: Web3 technology – and in particular blockchain – benefits users by providing them with enhanced control of their assets. Fully harnessing these benefits requires users to have some interaction with the underlying technology, which the current Odyssey design explicitly does not do. How Starbucks will manage users’ requests for features such as self-custody – and whether users will want such features in the first place – remains to be seen.  Read more: Web3 Needs In-Person Gatherings | Opinion  Launching in-demand NFTs and achieving profitability: There’s no doubt that being a leading company engaging with Web3 will provide publicity benefits to Starbucks. And certainly many consumers will be happy to receive free NFTs. But Starbucks will surely want to achieve more than this – to go beyond marketing expense and establish a profitable endeavor that generates direct and indirect revenues.  The market has shown that just because there is an NFT does not mean that consumers are interested in paying for it. Starbucks faces a daunting challenge to design digital rewards that are interesting enough to its customers, particularly its Gen Z demographic, to form the basis of an effective rewards program and attract ongoing revenue streams. Achieving one or both is necessary to make this program more than just a one-off fad until the next emerging technology appears.  While it’s unclear how Starbucks will tackle these obstacles, Starbucks Odyssey will nevertheless serve as a fascinating and highly informative test case for corporate implementation of Web3. Most interestingly, it provides a test of the adoption potential and limits for Web3. Given the ultimate consumer-focused company is at the helm, will we see Starbucks finally make Web3 mainstream?",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Stephanie Hurder,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/04/can-starbucks-bring-web3-into-the-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b02985127210ff4af7242dd09038b79a21958338-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394505,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw96Yn,1664895848,"Bitcoin Halving, Explained","The Bitcoin halving, also known as “the halvening,” is the name for one of the most hotly anticipated recurring events in Bitcoin’s history.  In April 2024, the number of bitcoin entering circulation every 10 minutes – known as block rewards – will drop by half, from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. It’s an event that is easy to see coming because it happens every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years) and has happened three times since 2009, when Bitcoin was created.  The allure of possible riches is what draws so much attention to these events. The number of new bitcoin entering circulation shrinks, but demand should, in theory, stay the same, possibly driving up the bitcoin’s price. And so the event has inspired passionate debate about bitcoin price predictions and how the market will respond.  “The theory is that there will be less bitcoin available to buy if miners have less to sell,” said Michael Dubrovsky, a co-founder of PoWx, a crypto research nonprofit.  But the periodic decline in the Bitcoin network’s minting rate could have a deeper significance than any near-term price movements for the functioning of the cryptocurrency. The block reward is an important component of Bitcoin, one that ensures the security of this leaderless system. As the rewards dwindle to zero in the decades ahead, it could potentially destabilize the economic incentives underlying bitcoin’s security.  For those trying to make sense of this complex topic, here’s everything you need to know.  What is the bitcoin halving?  New bitcoins enter circulation as block rewards, produced by the efforts of bitcoin miners who use expensive electronic equipment to earn, or “mine,” them by discovering new blocks, verifying transactions and adding them to the Bitcoin blockchain.  Roughly every four years, the total number of bitcoin that miners can potentially win is halved (miners also earn transaction fees when building bitcoin blocks). This is intentional. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, programmed the halving into Bitcoin’s core code with the intention of creating scarcity over time (more on that later).  In 2009, the system rewarded successful miners with 50 bitcoin every 10 minutes. Three halvings later, 6.25 bitcoins are being dispensed every 10 minutes.  Learn More: How the ‘Halving’ Could Impact Bitcoin  The process will end once the number of bitcoin in circulation reaches 21 million. A popular estimate is that it will occur sometime near the year 2140.  When is the next Bitcoin halving?  The next Bitcoin halving is expected to occur around April 2024. The exact date is difficult to predict as it depends on block height being reached, but it is estimated to happen around April 19-20. During the 2024 halving, the block reward for miners will be cut in half, from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.  Who chose the Bitcoin distribution schedule? Why?  Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who may have been an individual or a team, disappeared about two years after he, she or they released the software into the world. So, he or she or they (we’ll just go with “they” from now on) are no longer around to explain why they chose this specific formula for adding new bitcoin into circulation.  But early emails written by Nakamoto shed some light on the mysterious figure’s (figures’) thinking.  Shortly after releasing the Bitcoin white paper, Nakamoto summarized the various ways their chosen monetary policy (the schedule by which miners receive block rewards) could play out, pondering the circumstances under which it could lead to deflation (when a currency’s purchasing power increases) or inflation (when the prices of goods and services purchasable with a currency increase).  Learn More: Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?  At the time, Nakamoto couldn’t have known how many people would use the new digital money (if anyone).  They elaborated very little on why they chose the particular formula they did: “Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula,” the wrote.  Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It’ll be distributed to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half every 4 years. first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins etc...  With most state-issued currencies a central bank, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, has tools at its disposal that enable it to add or remove dollars from circulation. If the economy is floundering, for instance, the Fed can increase circulation and encourage lending by purchasing securities from banks. Alternatively, if the Fed wants to remove dollars from the economy, it can sell securities from its account.  For better or worse, bitcoin is a bit different. For one, the supply schedule is all but set in stone.  Unlike the monetary policy of state-issued currencies, which unfolds through political processes and human institutions, Bitcoin’s monetary policy is written into code shared across the network. Changing it would require an immense output of coordination and agreement across the community of Bitcoin users.  Additionally, the 21 million cap on the number of coins that can enter circulation makes them scarce (at least in comparison to dollars or euros), which for some people is enough to make them valuable.  Another unique aspect of Bitcoin is Nakamoto programmed the block reward to decrease over time, which is why some people say Bitcoin has a predictable monetary policy. That is another way in which it differs from the norm for modern financial systems, where central banks control the money supply. In stark contrast to Bitcoin’s halving block reward, the supply of the dollar has roughly tripled since 2000.  Nakamoto left clues that they created Bitcoin for political reasons. The first Bitcoin block features the headline of a newspaper article: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”  Many have come to interpret that statement as a sign of Nakamoto’s political beliefs and goals. If widely adopted, Bitcoin could potentially reduce the power banks and governments have over monetary policy, including bailouts of struggling institutions. As shown with the block reward, no central entity can create bitcoin outside of the strict schedule.  How does halving influence bitcoin’s price?  A Bitcoin halving grabs so much attention mostly because many believe it will lead to a price increase. The theory is that when the supply of bitcoin declines, the demand for bitcoin will stay the same, pushing the price up. The truth is, no one knows what's going to happen.  Bitcoin has seen three halvings so far, which we can look to as precedents.  The 2012 halving provided the first demonstration of how markets would respond to Nakamoto’s unorthodox supply schedule. Until then, the Bitcoin community didn’t know how a sudden decline in rewards would affect the network. As it turned out, the price began to rise shortly after the halving.  The second halving on July 16, 2016 was highly anticipated, with CoinDesk running a live blog of the event and Blockchain.com putting out a “countdown.” The price dropped by 10%, but then shot back up to where it was before.  Learn More: Bitcoin’s Third Halving Arrives  Although the immediate impact on the price of bitcoin was small, the market did eventually respond over the course of the year following the second halving. Some argue that the 2017 bull run was a delayed result of the halving. Looking at bitcoin’s price 365 days after the second halving, we can see it rose by 284% to $2,506, in July 2017. By the end of that year bitcoin was trading above $19,000.  After the 2020 halving, on May 11, bitcoin’s price continued to perform bullishly a full year after the event took place. This time, it rose by more than 559%, from around $8,700 in 2020 to $56,000 in 2021.  Still, just because the halvings have so far preceded bull runs does not mean there is a causal relationship — three data points is a trend, not a study. Many analysts treat the halving as a “buy the rumor, sell the news” type of event, given the amount of media attention that it typically garners.  Why do miners get these rewards?  Bitcoin wouldn’t work at all without block rewards.  As pseudonymous independent researcher Hasu put it, there are two parts to making Bitcoin work. “Bitcoin’s ledger state should answer the question of ‘who owns what, when?’” Hasu told CoinDesk.  The first part, “who owns what?” is solved by cryptography. Only the owner of a private key (which is like a secret access code) can spend the bitcoin.  The game theory that secures Bitcoin requires that a) miners have an incentive to mine honest blocks [and] b) miners have a cost ... to attempting dishonesty.  “The second half (‘when?’) is the big challenge and was unsolved before Bitcoin,” Hasu said. Miners validate that transactions are legitimate, preventing people from “double-spending” their coins or effectively creating money from thin air.  Without the block rewards, which incentive miners to expend energy and costs to participate in this process, the Bitcoin network would be in chaos.  What happens when block rewards get very small or taper off entirely?  The more money miners can earn by way of block rewards or trading fees, the more mining power goes to Bitcoin, and thus the more protected the network is. That is why the periodic decrease in rewards might eventually become an issue.  Miners need an incentive to do what they do. They need to get paid. They’re not running these expensive, electricity-guzzling computers for their health after all.  But the consequence of the decline in block rewards is that eventually, it will dwindle to nothing. Transaction fees, which users pay each time they send a transaction, are the other way miners earn money. (Theoretically, these fees are optional, although as a practical matter, a transaction without one might have to wait a long time to be processed if the network is congested; the size of the fee is set by the user or their wallet software.)  It’s impossible to predict what will happen, but if we want a system that could last 100 years, we should be ready for the worst case.  Because the mining subsidy is designed to decrease through programmatic halving events, fees will become a more important source of remuneration for miners overtime.  “In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes. I’m sure that in 20 years, there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume,” Nakamoto wrote.  But for a long time, Bitcoin researchers have been considering the possibility that transaction fees won’t suffice. For one thing, it means transactions might need to grow more expensive over time to keep the network secure.  “This cannot really work without very expensive transaction costs because Bitcoin cannot process huge quantities of transactions on-chain,” Dubrovsky said.  The emergence of new ways of using the Bitcoin network, including the introduction of the Ordinals protocol that enables non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin and the BRC-20 standard for the development of Ethereum-like tokens has already driven up the number of on-chain transactions, and therefore the amount in fees miners are earning.  It is unclear where this activity will lead, especially because Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens are controversial among the Bitcoin community. To date, it is primarily mining rewards that have incentivized the development of a competitive, globally diverse bitcoin mining industry, hardening it against attacks that try to circumvent the network’s rules. It’s unclear whether a future attenuated block reward will have the same allure for miners.  It is already being predicted by research firms like Galaxy Digital that out-of-date ASICs chips designed for mining bitcoin will become unprofitable to run after the upcoming having, meaning there will be less total hashpower directed towards the network.  “I don’t think this halving will make Bitcoin significantly less secure, but in eight to 12 years, we could find ourselves in hot water,” Hasu said.  Part of the problem is that more than a decade after Bitcoin’s birth the market is still figuring out the true cost of protecting the network from attackers.  “Nobody knows the correct level of security needed to keep Bitcoin safe. Currently, Bitcoin pays out something like $5 billion per year and there are no successful attacks; however, there has  Updated 10/06/2021 to reflect the most recent bitcoin halving, which took place on May 11, 2020.

Market Moves: Bitcoin's bullish momentum is building.  Chart of the Day: Financial stress remains contained, weakening the case for the so-called Fed pivot.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) rose 5% over the last 24 hours, reaching an important psychological level of $20,000 as global markets climbed, lifting U.S. index futures and European stocks. The move comes as investors were eyeing whether central banks will have to slow their pace of monetary tightening.  Ethereum (ETH) was up by 4% on day to $1,350.  ""Investors know that the stronger the U.S. dollar, the more sell pressure on BTC,"" said Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index platform.  “Many investors feel the Fed could pivot and drop interest rates as the Bank of England just did. This would trigger a large buying opportunity for BTC, which is extremely bullish,” Storry said.  “Smart money is beginning to build positions already. Hence the recent price bump."" he added.  DeFi (decentralized-finance) tokens also rallied on Tuesday, with Chainlink’s LINK up 7.5% and the token for liquid staking protocol Lido DAO (LDO) up 9.6%.  Other winners included the tokens of Quant Network, up 8%, Polygon (MATIC), up 7% and Cosmos (ATOM), up 7.4%.  In the news, Grayscale Investments, which offers the world’s biggest bitcoin trust, is bringing a key administrative role for all of its products in-house through a new broker-dealer unit.  Grayscale Securities, the new broker-deal division, will handle selling shares of the company’s crypto trust products, taking over a function previously provided by fellow Digital Currency Group subsidiary Genesis Global Trading. (Digital Currency Group also owns CoinDesk.)  And Web3 data startup Golden has raised $40 million in a Series B funding round that was led by the crypto arm of noted venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, according to a post on the company’s website.

Market Moves  Bitcoin Gains Momentum on Fed Pivot Narrative, But Some Banks Anticipate Dollar Rebound  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin continues to build bullish momentum, hoping that financial stability risks and signs of economic slowdown will force the Federal Reserve to pivot away from aggressive liquidity withdrawal measures. However, some observers are unconvinced the Fed will abandon or dramatically slow the so-called liquidity tightening anytime soon and expect renewed dollar strength.  The top cryptocurrency by market value reached a high of $20,150 soon before press time, registering a 2% gain for the day. The dollar index fell to a nine-day low of 11, having hit a two-decade high of 114.77 on Sept. 28.  Bitcoin buyers stepped in on Monday after the U.S. Institute of Supply Management said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index dropped to 50.9 in September, the lowest reading since May 2020, from 52.8 in August. Notably, the index's new orders and employment measures contracted, strengthening the case for the Fed pivot.  ""It’s been a case of ‘bad news is good news’ for equities, with the market treating the downside surprise to the ISM index as increasing the chances of an earlier Fed pause, seen as positive for risk assets,"" the Bank of New Zealand's research team wrote in clients early Tuesday. Bitcoin tends to move more or less in line with equities and has halved this year in terms of market value, with the Fed raising rates by 300 basis points.  Expectations that the Fed and other major central banks would slow tightening gripped the market last week after the Bank of England announced a bond purchase program, popularly known as quantitative easing, to ensure the orderly functioning of the government bond market.

Despite this difficult macro backdrop, Barclays sees compelling risk/reward for Core at current levels.  The shares of crypto hosting and mining company rose about 9.5% in premarket trading on Tuesday, amid a rally in the bitcoin price on the hope that financial stability risks and signs of economic slowdown will force the U.S. Federal Reserve to pivot away from aggressive liquidity withdrawal measures.  Barclays initiated coverage of Core with an overweight rating and a $3 price target. The stock had nine buy ratings and an average 12-month price target of $5.97, according to FactSet data.  Compass Point echoed this positive sentiment about the company in a report last week.

The new SMA service will initially support three active strategies: bitcoin (BTC) alone, bitcoin and ether (BTC), as well as bitcoin, ether, SOL and MATIC. Valkyrie will offer its SMAs to financial advisors, family offices and other financial institutions that can then pitch their clients.  Valkyrie is now the third asset manager to announce crypto SMA plans after Ark Invest and Franklin Templeton, a sign of the maturing crypto product industry with Wall Street involvement. Ark and Franklin Templeton are working with Eaglebrook Advisors for their SMAs.  SMAs are investment products that offer its investors direct ownership over the underlying asset, even though the positions are managed by a firm – in this case Valkyrie. Valkyrie Funds Managing Director John Key told CoinDesk that the SMAs will rely on Valkyrie’s research to rebalance positions for downside protection and upside exposure.  “Other products in general are typically passive or follow some kind of index, so we think we’re really bringing a value added by using our research,” Key said.  The market has not previously seen crypto SMAs because crypto remains “a fairly new asset class,"" with only a few firms building traditional products with crypto exposure, Key explained. There is a growing section of crypto-curious traditional investors who are hesitant to make direct investments, which means there is a market for SMAs, he noted.

The blockchain-based gaming startup plans to use the capital to build out its Sequence developer platform, Niftyswap marketplace and Skyweaver game and to hire more staff.  Skyweaver is an online game where players can battle other players using fantasy-based trading cards in the form of NFTs, which are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items. As of June, more than 400,000 accounts had been created on the platform.  The round was led by Brevan Howard Digital and Morgan Creek Digital and included investments from traditional gaming companies Ubisoft (UBI) and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO). Other participants included Polygon, Bitkraft Ventures, CMT Digital, Quantstamp, Round13 Capital, Xchange and Everyrealm, as well as individual investors, including Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke, Sandbox co-founder Sebastien Borget and Axie Infinity co-founder Aleksander Larsen.  Bloomberg was the first to report on the funding round. No valuation was disclosed, though Chief Financial Officer Deborah Marfurt said it was higher than the company's previous funding round last year, when it was valued at $89.5 million, according to the Bloomberg report, which cited PitchBook data.

Expected to go live by October 28 the zkSync 2.0 mainnet will improve scaling possibilities for tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain. zkSync 2.0 To Boost Layer-2 Ethereum Scaling Options The first production, zkEVM zkRollup, is approaching; the team tweeted on October 3 while mentioning several previous collaborations. With zero-knowledge rollups, the scaling platform zkSync can batch transactions and boost throughput. A zkRollup processes a large portion of the transaction data off the root chain by generating cryptographic proofs that allow users to demonstrate that it has a particular piece of information without disclosing the specifics of that information (thus the term &apos;zero-knowledge&apos;). With the launch of the 2.0 mainnet, Matter Labs, the company behind the development of zkSync, hopes to move closer to resolving the blockchain trilemma. ZkRollups are the future of Ethereum scaling. The challenge with blockchains is improving two core characteristics—security, scalability, and decentralization—without compromising the third. Ethereum lacks scalability but is currently incredibly safe and decentralized. zkRollups Eyes to Dominate Layer-2 Solutions Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum, has previously said that he thinks zkRollups will dominate layer-2 scaling in the f...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/zksync-2-0-is-expected-to-launch-around-oct-28/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

However, some observers are unconvinced the Fed will abandon or dramatically slow the so-called liquidity tightening anytime soon, and they expect renewed dollar strength.  The top cryptocurrency by market value reached a high of $20,150 soon before press time, registering a 2% gain for the day. The dollar index fell to a nine-day low of 11, having hit a two-decade high of 114.77 on Sept. 28.  Bitcoin buyers stepped in on Monday after the U.S. Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 50.9 in September, the lowest reading since May 2020, from 52.8 in August. Notably, the index's new orders and employment measures contracted, strengthening the case for the Fed pivot.  ""It’s been a case of ‘bad news is good news’ for equities, with the market treating the downside surprise to the ISM index as increasing the chances of an earlier Fed pause, seen as positive for risk assets,"" Bank of New Zealand's research team wrote in clients early Tuesday. Bitcoin tends to move more or less in line with equities and has halved this year in terms of market value, with the Fed raising rates by 300 basis points.  Expectations that the Fed and other major central banks would slow tightening gripped the market last week after the Bank of England (BOE) announced a bond purchase program, popularly known as quantitative easing, to ensure the orderly functioning of the government bond market.  ""What the Bank of England did was a template for what others are likely to do,"" Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told Bloomberg. ""The soaring dollar has been associated in the past with creating financial crisis on a global basis. We have to have a global perspective on this.""  Fed funds futures  Futures trading in federal funds suggests that traders are again pricing rate cuts from May 2023. And while the market still sees a high chance of yet another 75 basis point (0.75 percentage point) rate hike next month, the pricing for the terminal rate – the expected high point for this interest-rate-hiking cycle – has come down to 4.4% from 4.75%.  However, analysts at ING believe central banks' inflation fight is far from over.  ""Markets are smelling blood in the water, but do they have enough evidence to price a policy turnaround? Not yet in our view,"" ING's analysts wrote in a note to clients. ""The BoE’s reluctance to buy gilts [U.K. government bonds] is a sign that it hasn’t given up the fight against inflation.""  While some Fed speakers have recently expressed concerns about the spillover effects of a stronger dollar, ING analysts are of the opinion that economic conditions don't warrant a pivot.  ""Despite somewhat weaker-than-expected ISM manufacturing figures yesterday, the U.S. domestic story remains rather solid, leaving the Fed tightening prospects alive even if markets have recently revised the expected terminal rate to sub 4.50% levels,"" analysts said in a note explaining why the dollar pullback may not have legs.  Analysts added that Friday's non-farm payrolls (NFP) – the U.S. Labor Department's monthly jobs report for September – might trigger a hawkish or pro-tightening repricing of Fed expectations.  Swedbank's Chief FX Strategist Anders Eklof said in a daily note that the recent rally in risk assets is mainly a function of an oversold market benefitting from the BOE intervention, and it could falter.  ""A U.S. NFP on the weak side is needed to keep the rally going.

The document offers a first analysis of how officials at the agency see risks in the crypto market, as they prepare to take on new duties under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation, MiCA.  “Due to their volatile growth cycles, and as long as relevant regulatory provisions do not apply, crypto-assets entail numerous risks which may in future become relevant for financial stability,” ESMA said.  “Multiple transmission channels between the crypto market and the traditional financial system exist,” the document said. “However, their scale remains limited at this time”  The document cites an April survey by regulators showing that, in April, just 90 European investment funds had direct exposure to crypto, with a further 20 exposed indirectly via derivatives – a drop in the ocean of the bloc’s 60,000 funds.  But officials warned that situation could change rapidly – citing auto maker Tesla, which last year said it would accept payments for its products in bitcoin before reconsidering, with both decisions affecting the price of the asset.  “Imagining a scenario in which a large retailer would enable crypto-assets as a payment option, or a leading tech company would introduce crypto-asset based peer-to-peer payments, consumer exposure could soar in a short period of time, strengthening the link” between the crypto and conventional financial realms, the document said.  ESMA officials are worried about repeating many of the risks which occur in traditional financial markets – such as price manipulation and mis-selling, citing exchanges such as Huobi and Bybit that allow risky bets via leverage of over 100 times.  But the study also looks at threats that are new to crypto – like manipulation of consensus mechanisms, large pseudonymous orders distorting prices, hacks and network congestion.  Under MiCA, expected to apply as of 2024, ESMA will be given new powers to decide exactly what needs to be in the white papers of newly issued assets, to heap extra regulation on those crypto assets deemed to resemble conventional financial instruments, and to monitor the largest service providers that have over 15 million customers.

42416145,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZjLz,1664868907,Shares in Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust Trade at 36% Discount to Fund's NAV,"While bitcoin's (BTC) bear market has paused, the shares in Grayscale Investment's bitcoin trust (GBTC) have yet to find relief.  The discount in GBTC shares relative to the underlying cryptocurrency held in the fund widened to a record 36.2% on Sept. 30, according to data tracked by Delphi Digital. GBTC shares slipped into the discount category in February last year and have traded lower than the fund's net asset value (NAV) ever since.  The GBTC is one of the most widely tracked funds in the crypto market, as the trust has been the preferred venue for institutional investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without having to purchase or take custody of the cryptocurrency.  So, it's natural to assume that the continued widening of the GBTC discount stems predominantly from the absence of institutional demand. However, that's not necessarily true and persistent discount at least partly reflects the increasing availability of alternatives like exchange-traded funds (ETF).  ""Some suggest that the increasing discount illustrates subsiding institutional interest in bitcoin, while others point to a wider offering of ETFs or alternative vehicles for BTC investment,"" Andrew Krohn, an analyst at crypto research firm Delphi Digital, wrote to clients on Monday.  Grayscale and CoinDesk are independent subsidiaries of the Digital Currency Group (DCG).  The Grayscale bitcoin trust is a close-ended fund, meaning BTC deposits remain locked forever. As of writing, the trust holds BTC 635,240, worth over $12 billion. That's roughly 3.3% of bitcoin's circulating supply.  Accredited investors can buy GBTC shares directly at the NAV by depositing bitcoin or U.S. dollars. The firm takes care of the custody and charges an annual management fee of 2% to investors. GBTC shares can be sold in the secondary market after a lock-in period of six months. So if prices fall within six months, all holders can do is sit and watch the value of their investment tank. The now-defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was one of the largest holders of GBTC.  The GBTC shares consistently traded at a premium before 2021. So, accredited investors purchased GBTC at NAV and sold those shares at a premium six months later, pocketing the difference. However, the so-called carry trade lost its shine once the premium flipped to discount in February 2021.  Besides, the launch of relatively cheaper ETFs in Canada, Europe and the U.S. later that year took away a significant chunk of demand from GBTC. While Grayscale doesn't allow redemptions and an ETF allows the market maker to create and redeem shares at will. So, traditional market funds and institutions prefer ETFs over close-ended funds like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.  In October last year, Grayscale filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to convert the trust into a spot-based ETF. However, the regulator rejected Grayscale's application in June this year, stating that the fund manager failed to answer the SEC's questions about preventing market manipulation.  According to Krohn, the discount will evaporate quickly should the trust get a go-ahead from the regulator. However, as of now, investor interest in taking bullish exposure via GBTC remains at an all-time low.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/04/shares-in-grayscales-bitcoin-trust-trade-at-36-discount-to-funds-nav,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10ef7e777f48aaff3954c13b71c97d223e5419f7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It is an international network of mining hotels that rents space for equipment and engages in BTC mining. The company&apos;s founders understand how difficult it is for an ordinary user to start mining cryptocurrency. Even large organisations cannot increase capacity with the increasing complexity of the Bitcoin network. GMT token allows everyone to earn rewards in BTC without any hassle. What is GMT Token? GMT mines Bitcoin on its equipment and distributes the reward among holders. Payments are conducted automatically via smart contracts, which have been audited by CertiK. Major part of the funds from the token sale are used to increase the capacity of GMT. Once the new equipment is put into operation, the issuer allocates an additional batch of tokens. The native currency protocol contains mechanisms for fundamental growth and protection against inflation. As the team commissions new equipment, they issue new tokens. The number of tokens issued is not proportional to the equipment capacity but is 20% fewer. That way, the team distributes the free power among all the tokens in circulation, ensuring that the power of each token grows, and so does the mining reward.

Bitcoin and Ether Climb Amid Renewed Hopes for a Fed Retreat  By James Rubin  Crypto investors who have appreciated bad, economic news more than good in recent months were feeling chipper on Monday as the latest manufacturing indicators arrived cooler than expected.  Bitcoin was recently trading over $19,550, up more than 2% over the past 24 hours, amid a surprising monthly decline in the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index, which measures factory activity. The drop didn't send asset prices soaring, but it offered faint hope that the economy was slowing meaningfully, inflation would soon be waning, and the U.S. central bank would be able to ratchet back its recent monetary hawkishness. Markets have been desperate for signs of improvement in the inflation battle that Federal Reserve officials see as key to long-range economic stability.  Ether was recently changing hands at just above $1,300, up roughly 3% from a day earlier, same time. Most other major altcoins in market value were trading higher, with ATOM and MATIC both rising more than 5%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, increased by over 2.5%.  Equity markets enjoyed a rare upswing with the tech-focused Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) jumping 2.3%, 2.6% and 2.7%, respectively. The increases followed a September of almost unbroken declines as investors continued to fret about rising prices and the prospect of a harsh recession.  Meanwhile, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasurys declined, continuing their path of the past few days after rising to 15-year highs late last month. Yields and asset prices usually travel in opposite directions. The decline may also reflect a surge in investor confidence that Fed policies are working.  Markets remained jittery about Credit Suisse as the investment banking giant tried to allay fears about its financial health, although the company's share price wound up only falling by about 1% on Monday. In Florida, the toll from Hurricane Ian continued to rise, although the cost in repairs and lost economic growth remains unclear.  In an email to CoinDesk, Jon Campagna, partner and head of trading and capital markets at crypto investment firm CoinFund, noted optimistically that bitcoin and cryptos in general have struggled in September but had their best performance in the last quarter of the year with an average quarterly return of more than 100%. ""It remains to be seen if history can repeat itself for Q4 the way it did for the month of September,"" he wrote.  And Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at financial tech firm iCapital, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program that bitcoin's price was ""a lot closer to the bottom than we have been, although she added that bitcoin was unlikely to escape the $19,000 to $20,000 band that it has been occupying ""until and unless the Fed pivots.""  ""Until then, I think, unfortunately, we're still going to be kept around these current levels,"" she said.

At least, that was the speculation of many crypto traders.  But the impact turned out to be underwhelming.  Since the mechanism was implemented a week ago, Binance destroyed – “burned” in crypto terms, or a reduction in the outstanding supply – $1.8 million worth of LUNC, based on a tweet Monday by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. That amount represents only 0.08% of the total supply of the token, too minuscule to make any measurable impact on the tokens' hyperinflated supply.  The price of LUNC dropped 12% in the last 24 hours, to $0.0003037, according to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko.  LUNC is the native token of the Terra Classic blockchain, which imploded this May, wiping out $60 billion in market value; the project’s algorithmic stablecoin lost its peg to the dollar, and LUNC, the token that was supposed to be its stabilizer, fell into hyperinflation. While most crypto developers and projects left the blockchain, some community members attempted to bring new life to the network by introducing a scheme that reduces the bloated supply of the token.  Read more: Luna (LUNA) vs. Luna Classic (LUNC): What Is the Difference?  LUNC almost doubled its price last week after Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, unveiled its own supply-reduction scheme, CoinDesk reported last week. The crypto exchange implemented a mechanism that destroys the same amount of coins as the fees it collects from trading LUNC.  LUNC became the third-most traded asset on Binance with trading volume after bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), according to data by CoinMarketCap.  The burn was calculated based on the token’s trading volume between Sept. 21 and Oct. 1. So Binance took 5.6 billion tokens out of circulation by sending them to a “burn” address, according to blockchain data.  Given that there are more than 6.8 trillion tokens in circulation, the burn rate works out to a meager 0.08% of the total supply – extrapolating to only a few percentage points of reduction on an annualized basis.  Binance's scheme “is meaningless in its direct impact,” a crypto trader who goes by the pseudonym of Ogle, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  “At this rate, assuming the volume continued to be as high as now (which I doubt), it would take 15 years to get to the total burn goal.”  Important events.
