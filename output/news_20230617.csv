13915580,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/polygon-proposes-new-ecosystem-council,1687035600,Polygon Proposes New Ecosystem Council,"Polygon, the renowned Ethereum scaling solution, recently proposed a new decentralized governance model aimed at enhancing its network's security, upgradeability, and robustness. This proposal, revolving around the establishment of an ""Ecosystem Council,"" will redefine how system smart contracts within the Polygon environment are managed and upgraded. This proposal indicates the continuous efforts by Polygon to strike a perfect balance between community-driven governance and efficient decision-making in a decentralized network. A New System for Decentralized Governance System smart contracts represent a fundamental element of the blockchain infrastructure. They can directly or indirectly influence user funds and the infrastructure's functioning. A crucial aspect of these contracts is their upgradeability, which allows seamless migration to improved versions under specific circumstances. The importance of this feature is evident in various Layer 2 (L2) solutions, such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync, where an efficient means of patching bugs and upgrading pivotal architecture components is required. According to the proposal, the Ecosystem Council would comprise technically proficient and value-aligned individuals, elected and removable by the community. This council will be responsible for performing timelock-limited upgrades to system smart contracts across Polygon networks, such as Polygon PoS and zkEVM. For example, in the case of non-emergency or routine proposals, the council will make a proposal and proceed with the timelock as usual. On the other hand, if there is a perceived threat to user funds due to potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts, the council will enact an Emergency State, freezing transactions to protect assets. The Polygon community will be empowered with three competencies: the election and removal of Ecosystem Council members, the ability to exit an Emergency State, and the power to veto any upgrade proposed by the Ecosystem Council. This model is expected to increase community engagement while retaining a level of control to prevent malicious activities. The Ecosystem Council: Balancing Efficiency and Decentralization The proposed model suggests the creation of an Ecosystem Council, a group consisting of reputable, technically adept, and value-aligned individuals. These individuals would be democratically elected by the community and could also be removed by them. The council's primary role would be to perform timelock-limited upgrades to the system's smart contracts across the Polygon networks, including the Polygon PoS and zkEVM. The governance model will allow the council to handle both routine and sensitive proposals. In the case of routine proposals, the council will make a proposal and proceed with the standard timelock protocol. However, if a potential vulnerability poses a risk to user funds, the council will enact an Emergency State, freezing transactions to protect the funds. To maintain a balance between efficiency and community engagement, Polygon proposes empowering the community with several competencies. These include the power to elect and remove Ecosystem Council members, the ability to exit the Emergency State, and the authority to veto any upgrade proposed and scheduled by the Ecosystem Council. By bestowing the community with these powers, Polygon hopes to increase the overall community engagement while maintaining a level of centralized control to prevent malicious activities. Navigating the Transition: Inviting Community Input While the proposed model promises improved governance and security, its rollout must be gradual and well planned, especially considering the live nature of the blockchain. To ensure a seamless transition, the Polygon team is inviting its community to participate in the process, providing feedback, and assisting in answering open questions. The community is particularly encouraged to contribute ideas regarding incentivizing participation in the model and establishing a robust and secure voting mechanism. Decisions around these aspects, like the general design principles, voting power proxy, and architecture, will be crucial to the model's success. The team is also considering the use of the $MATIC token as a voting power proxy, which would provide broad ecosystem inclusion and legitimize the Ecosystem Council. Polygon's proposed Ecosystem Council represents an exciting step towards more robust, efficient, and community-driven governance of system smart contracts. By integrating elements of both centralized and decentralized decision-making, the model aims to bring the best of both worlds to the Polygon network. This move could help Polygon maintain its reputation as a leading Layer 2 solution, offering an improved governance framework that values efficiency, security, and community inclusion.

This Friday’s close saw price recover above a crucial level that in the past led to a bullish impulse in crypto. Here is a closer look at why bulls could be ready to charge in the coming weeks. Using BTC CME Futures As A Crypto Crystal Ball Large institutional traders don’t just trade spot BTCUSD, nor do they trade on Binance, ByBit, or another crypto platform. When they want to speculate and trade using derivatives contracts, they look to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, better known as CME Group. Unlike the 24/7, always-on crypto market, CME Group charts close down for the weekend and holidays much like stocks. Due to this behavior, the chart often features gaps that don’t appear on standard BTCUSD price charts. Discrepancies between BTC CME Futures charts and BTCUSD charts can lead to fakeouts and shakeouts. Related Reading: One Coin, Two Trades: Why Bitcoin Futures And Spot Signals Don’t Match Up Because Bitcoin CME Futures does stop on Friday for the weekend, it also can provide early clues as to how spot price charts might close on Sunday night. In this case, BTC Futures has reclaimed the Bollinger Band basis line, often referred to as the “mid-BB”. Is the third time the charm? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Price Recovers Above The Bollinger Band Basis Line The basis line on the Bollinger Bands is a 20-period simple moving average. The tool’s creator, John Bollinger, then adds an upper and lower band set at two standard deviations of the SMA. This causes the bands to expand and contract with market volatility. Like any moving average, it can act as dynamic support and resistance, holding up price action or preventing it from pushing along further. Following this Friday’s BTC Futures weekly close, Bitcoin has made it back above the mid-BB, possibly confirming it as support. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Throwback” Could Trigger Flawless Technical Bottom Formation In the upper portion of the chart above, Bitcoin goes on an impulsive uptrend after holding above the basis line in 2019 and 2020. The lower portion depicts a closer look at this latest weekly close. Unless there is a massive collapse before Sunday night, BTCUSD technicals should follow suit. And if history repeats, a bull run could follow. Is Bitcoin ready for a strong rally higher after reclaiming the key level as support?

While reasons for the individual account terminations remain undisclosed, the named entities included MoonPay, BlockFi, CMS Holdings, and Galois Capital. Responding to the unfolding situation, Tether indicated its reluctance to comment on specific customer relationships, noting that each party had undergone stringent compliance checks both during onboarding and throughout their relationship, in line with Tether's compliance policies. NYAG Investigation and Tether's Commitment to Transparency While the NYAG investigation wrapped up in early 2021, some of the documents in question extend until June of that year. These documents were collected during the NYAG's probe into Tether and sister company Bitfinex over the alleged misappropriation of $850 million. During this investigation, iFinex, the parent company of both entities, requested an extension to produce the required financial documents. Following a settlement that included an $18.5 million penalty and the cessation of trading in New York, media outlets and Coinbase sought the public disclosure of Tether’s initial quarterly report under the Freedom of Information Act. However, Tether opposed this motion, citing the need to protect its customers' confidential data. Despite Tether's objections, the NYAG granted media outlets access to the documents, leading to the revelation about the deacttivation of numerous company accounts. Tether's Stance on Transparency and Risk Management Tether remains adamant about its commitment to transparency while prioritizing its customers' privacy and security. Following the settlement with the NYAG, Tether has diligently completed its quarterly reporting obligations, affirming its commitment to openness and transparency. Notably, Tether claims that it takes pride in its meticulous development of risk metrics and processes, enabling its investment and financial teams to thoroughly assess the risk tied to the company's financial interactions. Tether has continually demonstrated its commitment to sustaining its business objectives while adhering to a robust risk management culture. Tether's Reserves and Commercial Papers Tether's dedication to maintaining the highest standards is evident in its transparent dealings regarding its lending program and reserves. Tether's reserves have proven to be extremely liquid, high-quality, and readily available to support any size of redemption, demonstrated by the repayment of US$7 billion in 48 hours in 2022. According to the released documents, Tether has consistently maintained an A2 or better rating for the majority of its commercial papers, and none of its past statements have undergone any changes. This commitment to upholding the highest standards has been echoed in the company's dedication to accountability and its unwavering risk management culture. The firm, however, has been severely criticized over past decisions, especially in the case of blocking an MEV Validator as a security response. Tether says that while media outlets have rushed to present this information to readers, Tether remains committed to its users, as well as for the benefit of the the broader crypto community. The company is keen to provide a factual point of reference about the disclosed materials, and it continues to cooperate with law enforcement, having assisted in over 150 investigations across four continents in the past 18 months.

13905455,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538338,1687009801,Polygon (MATIC) Witnesses High Volatility Amid Positive Developments,"Polygon (MATIC), one of the prominent Web3 networks, has recently experienced a period of volatility in its price. Currently trading at $0.625112 USD, with a 24-hour trading volume of $547,815,952 USD, MATIC has shown a 9.63% increase in the last 24 hours. Polygon has rebounded from the bearish sentiments earlier in the week. This comes on the back of recent developments within the Polygon ecosystem towards increasing utility and partnerships with key financial institutions. Polygon Launches ‘The Value Prop’ Polygon has made an important announcement, launching “The Value Prop,” an open database of blockchain use cases. This comprehensive catalog contains over 300 applications and diverse use cases across multiple business sectors, blockchain networks, and geographical locations. The initiative aims to showcase positive applications for blockchain technology, presenting it as a versatile tool beyond asset trading. Related Reading: Percentage Of ETH Addresses In Profit Reaches 5-Month Low Amid the negative sentiment surrounding blockchain technology due to regulatory pressures on major market participants like Binance and Coinbase, Polygon’s move to highlight real-world applications is significant. It aligns with the belief among Web3 experts and industry players that blockchain should be viewed as a general-purpose technology addressing real-world challenges. Web3 Development And Positive Trends Polygon’s efforts to boost Web3 development and unlock new use cases align with the industry’s overall trajectory. Ripple (XRP) recently partnered with Banco de la República, Colombia’s central bank, to explore blockchain use cases. This indicates a growing recognition of the potential of blockchain technology beyond cryptocurrencies. Polygon’s co-founder, Sandeep Nailwal, also launched the Nailwal Fellowship, a grant program providing financial support and resources to early-stage Web3 developers. This initiative offers funding, mentorship, and access to top founders and investors, nurturing the growth of the Web3 ecosystem. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Positive Social Sentiment Sparks Bullish Speculation Despite the U.S. banking crisis contagion, Web3 development has shown resilience. According to Alchemy, a blockchain developer platform, Q1 2023 witnessed rapid growth in Web3 development. The number of developer teams working on the Alchemy platform reached a record high, with increased activity compared to the previous year. Future Prospect For Polygon MATIC, the native token of Polygon, is trading in the positive zone and is up 9% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the price is $0.6228, according to TradingView chart. However, amid the price volatility, the launch of “The Value Prop” and the focus on Web3 development suggest potential positive catalysts for Polygon’s future performance. As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, market participants will closely monitor the progress of Web3 development, the expansion of real-world use cases, and the regulatory landscape. These factors will significantly impact the prospects of Polygon and its native token, MATIC.

These selections are the result of a comprehensive analysis conducted by Uniswap's Bridge Assessment Committee, which evaluated a range of potential protocols. The proposed changes are also aligned to the protocol's recent disclosure of its plans for V4. Diving Deep into the Decision Uniswap's Bridge Assessment Committee scrutinized multiple contenders, namely Wormhole, Celer, DeBridge, LayerZero, Axelar, and Multichain (CRP). Each of these was rigorously assessed for its proficiency in facilitating cross-chain governance. Out of the competition, Wormhole and Axelar emerged victorious, with the committee endorsing these two for utilization across all cross-chain deployments. As the committee puts it, both Wormhole and Axelar have demonstrated their aptness in managing governance messaging for potential cross-chain deployments. They, however, advised the community to persistently review these and other bridge providers, bearing in mind the dynamics of the industry. Cross-Chain Governance and Its Implications The fundamental application for Uniswap DAO's cross-chain bridge lies in its ability to relay governance messages from Ethereum to other chains for execution. All Uniswap deployment proposals undertake a formal voting procedure on Ethereum. Any upgrades for deployments on alternate chains are then communicated via a cross-chain messaging protocol. While Wormhole and Axelar have gained the committee's approval, this doesn't entirely exclude other bridges. The report also pointed out that those deemed unsuitable for Uniswap's present cross-chain governance needs might still satisfy the prerequisites of other protocols and applications. Vulnerabilities and Controversies: The Story of Cross-Chain Bridges The controversy around cross-chain bridges in the Web3 sphere is nothing new. In 2022, these bridging protocols proved to be a weak spot, with hackers successfully exploiting them and causing billions in losses. As per data from Rekt, four out of the top five most expensive DeFi breaches targeted bridges, resulting in an aggregated loss of over $2.1 billion. In response to these vulnerabilities, Uniswap has formed its Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment Committee to aid governance delegates and the Uniswap community in making well-informed decisions regarding cross-chain bridging protocols. The Committee's evaluations covered more than 130 assessment questions for each protocol, taking into account their ability to ensure ""safety, liveness, and censorship resistance"". Looking ahead, Celer and DeBridge might be reassessed despite their current shortcomings in slashing mechanisms and security assurances. The report was notably critical of Multichain for its lack of transparency and ineffective deterrents to prevent validator collusion. To underscore the context, Uniswap has over $5.9 billion locked in its protocol as of May 2023, with daily transaction volume frequently exceeding $1 billion. Given these figures, Uniswap's choice of Wormhole and Axelar could have significant implications for both the involved protocols and Uniswap's ongoing cross-chain operations.

ZachXBT, a popular crypto on-chain sleuth recently got slapped with a defamatory lawsuit over an article he published last year. The Controversial Article That Started It All Around a year ago, ZachXBT published an article accusing Jeffrey Huang aka MachiBigBrother, of embezzling crypto assets using various methods ranging from failed pump and dump tokens to NFT projects. The article quickly gained widespread attention at the time, but it has been largely forgotten up until this point. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Positive Social Sentiment Sparks Bullish Speculation Jeffrey Huang, known online as Machi Big Brother, is a former Taiwanese-American musician and tech entrepreneur. Huang has now filed a defamation lawsuit against ZachXBT, claiming the year-old article has damaged his reputation. Huang has insisted, at least according to a post that he published on Twitter, that ZachXBT’s charges are false and defamatory. As a result, he has decided to sue for defamation of character. A cursory reading of the article, on the other hand, reveals that it is an investigational piece that goes into considerable detail. In the article, ZachXBT provided on-chain data to back up his claims. The crypto sleuth initially accused Machi Big Brother of embezzling 22,000 ETH from Formosa Financial, a treasury management platform built for blockchain companies in 2018. Furthermore, ZachXBT then provided a list of other projects like Machi X and Wifey Finance. Total market cap still sitting above $1 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com How ZachXBT Is Fighting Back Against The Lawsuit ZachXBT is not taking this lawsuit lying down as he’s come out swinging against what he calls a baseless lawsuit with “an attempt to chill free speech.” ZachXBT has asked his followers and subscribers to support him against censorship and cancel culture, ensuring the truth survives. He termed the whole situation as a “classic David & Goliath story,” and many have spoken out on social media defending his right to express his opinions. Brown Rudnick, a law firm with its headquarters in Boston famous for defending Johnny Depp in his case against his ex-wife Amber Heard, has agreed to represent ZachXBT in the lawsuit. Related Reading: PEPE Jumps Nearly 10% In 24 Hours, Sparking Speculation Of A New Rally While lawsuits can be expensive to defend, ZachXBT says he will rely on donations from his followers to mount a proper defense.

At the time of this writing, the address now contains more than $290,000.

13902975,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538333,1687003587,"Binance Coin (BNB) Faces Sideways Movement, Bears Threaten Further Sell-Off","Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of the Binance exchange, has recently experienced a period of sideways movement. Despite reaching a weekly high of $307 on June 4th, BNB’s price has encountered resistance and is currently trading at $246.2. This article provides an analysis of the recent price action, discusses the potential reasons behind BNB’s performance, and explores the future prospects for the coin. The recent decline in BNB’s price can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the overall market sentiment has been influenced by a broader correction in the cryptocurrency market. Many altcoins, including BNB, have witnessed a decrease in value as investors take profits and adjust their portfolios. Additionally, concerns over regulatory developments and market uncertainties have added to the selling pressure on BNB. Bearish Threat And Technical Indicators Despite attempts by bulls to regain control, bears pose a significant threat to BNB’s price stability. The crucial resistance level of $308 has become a battleground for market participants. If the bears manage to break down this level, it could trigger a further sell-off, potentially pushing the price lower. Technical indicators paint a cautious picture for BNB. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has exhibited a bearish crossover, signaling a continuation of selling pressure in the near term. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 35.63 levels, suggesting that there could be a further downside if buying pressure does not increase. Related Reading: PEPE Jumps Nearly 10% In 24 Hours, Sparking Speculation Of A New Rally Moreover, the 50-Weekly Moving Average positioned below the 200-Weekly MA indicates a bearish trend for BNB. This configuration suggests that the price could continue downward in the coming days unless significant positive developments or market catalysts emerge. What’s Next For BNB? Market participants will closely monitor the price action around the critical resistance level of $308. A successful breach above this level could ignite renewed bullish momentum, potentially leading to a recovery in BNB’s price. Traders and investors will also pay attention to any regulatory developments and market trends that could influence BNB’s performance. Despite the current challenges, Binance Coin holds promise as a key player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As Binance continues to expand its services and offerings, including its decentralized exchange (DEX) and various partnerships, there is potential for increased adoption of BNB, which could positively impact its price in the long run. Related Reading: Percentage Of ETH Addresses In Profit Reaches 5-Month Low It is important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can change rapidly.

Rumors of Airphoria: A Possible Revolution in the Gaming Industry In a series of June 16 social media posts, Nike teased an event set for June 20, which they termed the ""ultimate Sneakerhunt"". A promotional video showcased the logos of both Fortnite and Nike's Air Max amidst floating clouds. As the video transitions, it unveils the name of this intriguing venture, 'Airphoria', ending with a display of Nike's Web3 platform .SWOOSH logo alongside that of Epic Games' Unreal Engine. On 6.20 the ultimate Sneakerhunt begins. 🏙️🌬️AirphoriaAirphoria pic.twitter.com/QgMyA1uXRT — Nike (@Nike) June 16, 2023 However, specific details remain elusive. Members of the NFT community have begun to speculate that Nike might have employed Fortnite Creative 2.0, a tool that allows users to craft their own virtual island game maps utilizing Fortnite assets, to devise an NFT-related game. A Leap Into Web3 for Nike with .SWOOSH This wouldn't be Nike's first foray into gaming. The company has been stepping up its efforts to merge its NFT unit, .SWOOSH, into traditional gaming. Just recently, on June 1, .SWOOSH announced its intention to incorporate its NFTs into games developed by EA Sports, a household name responsible for the incredibly successful FIFA soccer game franchise, among others. Although it's still not confirmed which EA Sports games will incorporate Nike NFTs, this latest hint seems to suggest that Nike's integration into the gaming world might be deeper than previously anticipated. Although not yet confirmed, the probability of NFTs featuring in Airphoria is high, given .SWOOSH's involvement and Epic Games' known affinity for NFT gaming. If the speculations prove to be true, the move could provide a considerable opportunity for Web3 adoption amongst traditional gamers. Considering Fortnite's impressive player base of over 242.9 million active players in the past 30 days, as reported by Active Player, the potential impact could be monumental. Nike has previously launched NFT sneakers on Polygon, as well as an earlier collaboration with RTFKT. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With Bitcoin (BTC) recently dipping below $25,000 before swiftly rebounding to $26,000, the market has been in a state of flux. Such fluctuations often create an environment ripe for alternative cryptocurrencies to make their mark, and PEPE could be poised to do just that. PEPE’s rally comes at a time when investors are seeking alternative options beyond the dominant cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin continues to dominate the market, its price movements can have a cascading effect on other digital assets. That being said, can PEPE capitalize on Bitcoin’s volatility and secure its own rally to attract investors seeking new opportunities in the crypto space? PEPE Price Recovery Potential In recent market developments, PEPE has witnessed a notable rally, as reflected in its current price of $0.0000009779 on CoinMarketCap. This surge represents an impressive 8.5% increase within a 24-hour period. However, it’s important to note that this upward momentum follows a preceding seven-day slump of 7.96%, underscoring the inherent volatility that characterizes the cryptocurrency market. PEPE showing bullish signs. Source: CoinMarketCap The price of PEPE has undergone substantial fluctuations since early May, resulting in a significant decline of over 50% in its overall value. This decline has caused a shift in the market structure, signaling a bearish trend as sellers capitalized on shorting opportunities when the support levels at $0.00000162 and $0.00000115 were breached. PEPE price in the green. Source: CoinMarketCap Despite the bearish downtrend, recent price activity has hinted at the potential for a new bull run. Notably, the crucial support level at $0.00000094 demonstrated resilience in halting the downward movement. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Sees Surge In Whale Buying Despite US Regulatory Pressure The ability of the $0.00000094 support level to withstand selling pressure signifies buying interest at this level, indicating a potential for a renewed bullish sentiment in the market. Bitcoin retakes the $26K territory on the weekend chart: TradingView.com What PEPE Needs To Sustain Its Rally As PEPE aims to maintain its rally and build on the recent positive momentum, several crucial milestones need to be achieved. According to a recent PEPE price report, a bullish surge in value would require breaking and closing above the trendline located around the $0.00000100 price zone. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Price Sheds 19% As Bearish Sentiment Looms Large This trendline acts as a significant resistance level that needs to be surpassed for the cryptocurrency to continue its upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the meme token may be due for a recovery bounce given that PEPE has been aggressively sold off recently. This possibility is made more likely by the fact that PEPE’s 24-hour trading volume has increased from just over $50 million earlier this week to more than $100 million at the time of writing.

However, should they be worried about this particular move by the $10 trillion asset manager? “I have not heard from any one client looking to buy a cryptocurrency at this time. Right now I can tell you that Worldwide, I have not heard from one client that said I need to be in this. Larry Fink. The Blackrock CEO did go on to say back in 2018 that his company would look back into crypto when it became more “legitimised”. Nearly 5 years later Blackrock is doing exactly that - but with crypto being singled out for extremely rough treatment from the SEC it could hardly be said that crypto has reached the legitimacy stage. When such a massive and powerful institutional entity as Blackrock files an application for a Bitcoin ETF, when so many have failed, it might be guessed that there will have been some quiet conversations behind the scenes, and that some plan could be in place to exert control over the premier crypto asset. The Blackrock ESG commitment Larry Fink has said that he and his company are committed to pushing its ESG agenda. “You have to force behaviours, and at Blackrock we are forcing behaviours” With Fink serving as a Trustee on the board of Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum, you can be sure that this application for a Bitcoin Spot ETF will somehow play along with the ESG narrative. How Blackrock could potentially take control An extremely thought-provoking tweet by @anilsaidso posits how Blackrock could in one fail swoop take control of Bitcoin. A hidden gem in the BlackRock ETF filing.#GetForked https://t.co/tER6xxZPui pic.twitter.com/Qdt8BZ2OEZ — Anil ⚡ (@anilsaidso) June 15, 2023 Hidden within the filing is what Blackrock would be able to do in the event of a Bitcoin hard fork. This is explosive beyond belief. Bitcoin has already been through hard forks in its history, and thus far the decentralised nature of Bitcoin has always won through, and forks of the original network have not been successful. What Blackrock is contemplating in the event of a hard fork is that it would get to choose which fork to go with, thereby deciding the future of Bitcoin. And given its love for the ESG narrative, what if Blackrock itself or one of its ‘associates’ proposed a PoS fork, and then all the institutions with backing of regulators and governments went with this fork and left the original PoW fork in its wake? Gold and silver were controlled Government and institutions were able to use subterfuge to squash the price of gold and silver over many decades so that they would not detract from the power of the dollar. Big banks used massive short selling whenever the prices took off, and were able to build huge positions in the metals, especially J P Morgan. Bitcoin is very similar to gold and silver in that it is sound money, meaning that it can’t be debased by governments in order to backstop banks or pay for wars. Look for the Blackrock Bitcoin Spot ETF to be approved by an anti-Bitcoin SEC, and then watch what happens very closely. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It also noted that interested parties could begin inquiries about purchasing the firm’s assets. The firm cited challenges arising from the prolonged bear market and not due to the regulatory conditions prevailing in the US markets. Bear Market Claims Another Victim Wyre announced its decision to shutter operations in a tweet on Friday. The decision comes a few months after Bolt Financial canceled its planned $1.5 billion purchase of the crypto payments firm. Since the cancellation of the purchase, the digital asset markets have seen a number of high-profile bankruptcies, such as FTX, along with lawsuits against prominent exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, from The United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also stressed that the decision was not due to any direction from regulatory agencies. “After nearly a decade, Wyre is winding down. Due to market conditions, we made this decision to protect the best interest of our key stakeholders and customers. This decision is not due to any regulatory agency direction. Wyre continues to secure customer assets.” Wyre also stated that customers have until Friday, 14th July 2023, to withdraw their assets via the Wyre dashboard. If customers miss this date, Wyre has laid down a separate process to enable the recovery of assets left on the platform. According to Wyre’s blog post, “Wyre continues to secure customer assets. If you have assets on the Wyre platform, you can continue to withdraw them via Wyre’s dashboard until Friday, 14th July. After then, we will have a separate process to recover assets remaining on the platform. We will post details on the process on our website and blog.” The Wyre team also seemed to suggest that the company’s assets were up for sale and that interested parties could inquire about purchasing the firm or its assets. “If you’re interested in acquiring Wyre’s or its subsidiaries’ assets, please reach out to 88 Partners.” Wyre’s Troubled Year Wyre has been in the doldrums since Bolt Financial decided to cancel its planned purchase of the company for $1.5 billion in September 2022. A few months after the failed acquisition, more trouble began for the company as its fiat-to-crypto on-ramp solution provider Juno urged users to withdraw their crypto assets from the Juno platform and self custody them. Given the uncertainty surrounding its custodial partner, Wyre, Juno stated that such a step was necessary. “Juno as a platform doesn’t custody crypto assets & relies on our crypto partner for these services. Due to uncertainty with our crypto partner, we have taken preemptive action in the interest of our customers.” The very next day, MetaMask also announced that it was ending support of the Wyre platform, citing several reports that the company was planning to shut down. MetaMask announced the news on its official Twitter handle, asking users not to use the Wyre service on the mobile aggregator. False Dawn A few days after MetaMask shuttered support for Wyre, the company announced the imposition of a 90% withdrawal limit for all its users. However, this limit was quickly removed following an announcement that Wyre had secured funding from an unnamed strategic partner. However, despite securing funding, Wyre still let go of 75 employees in January 2023. The announcement to mark the firm shutting down operations marks the end of Wyre after the company had explored several strategic options in a bid to stay afloat. The company had stated in January, “We sincerely appreciate the support and positive sentiments from our community as well as the crypto ecosystem at large as we pursue options that will enable Wyre to flourish. Our operations continue, and we will share information with the community as it is available.” A Growing List Of Bear Market Casualties Wyre is the latest in a growing list of crypto companies and blockchain firms that have buckled under the pressure of an unending bear market. Just in May alone, several firms, including Lightning Network payments platform BottlePay, NFT platform Terressa, crypto exchange HotBit, and Digital Currency Group’s institutional trading platform TradeBlock, all shuttered operations thanks to the prolonged crypto winter. EmpireDAO also ended its tenancy at 190 Bowery in New York, giving further evidence of a market downturn. The crypto-exclusive co-working space was founded by Mike Fraietta, with its office building often touted as the WeWork of Web3. Fraietta stated at the time, “We tried every which way to get new sponsors, partnerships, and even crowdfunding.

The parties announced a deal late Friday to ensure that only Binance.US employees can access customer funds in the short term, which Judge Amy Berman Jackson, of the District Court for the District of Columbia, signed early Saturday. The judge also ordered the parties to begin proposing timelines for the broader lawsuit.  According to the proposed agreement, Binance.US will take steps to make sure that no officials from Binance Holdings, the global exchange, have access to private keys for wallets or hardware wallets, or root access to Binance.US's Amazon Web Services tools. The U.S.-based crypto trading platform will share detailed information about its business expenses, including estimated costs, in the coming weeks.  The proposed deal responded to an SEC motion to freeze all of Binance.US's assets while it pursues the exchange on securities-related charges. The regulator said it was concerned that funds could be moved offshore or records destroyed if it was not granted a temporary restraining order (TRO). Binance.US's attorneys pushed back, saying that freezing all assets would amount to the ""death penalty.""  Judge Jackson told the parties that it would be better for them to come to an agreement on a proposed stipulation than to have her craft a restraining order, which would come with a two-week time limit. Two weeks would give insufficient time to prepare, given the more than 4,000 pages of exhibits the parties have already filed, she said during a hearing earlier this week.  Read more: U.S. Judge Rebuffs SEC Request for Binance.US Asset Freeze for Now  Other provisions in the proposed agreement will see Binance.US create new crypto wallets that global employees have no access to, provide additional information to the SEC, and agree to an expedited discovery schedule.  U.S.-based customers will still be allowed to withdraw funds during this time.  The proposed agreement will address some of the SEC's stated concerns as the broader lawsuit it filed works its way through the judicial system. The SEC sued Binance and Binance.US last week on charges of offering and trading unregistered securities, but also alleged massive commingling of funds and other poor practices. The proposed agreement does not delve into the broader suit.  In a press release, SEC Director of Enforcement Gurbir Grewal said, ""Given that Changpeng Zhao and Binance have control of the platforms’ customers’ assets and have been able to commingle customer assets or divert customer assets as they please, as we have alleged, these prohibitions are essential to protecting investor assets. Further, we ensured that U.S. customers will be able to withdraw their assets from the platform while we work to resolve the alleged underlying misconduct and hold Zhao and the Binance entities accountable for their alleged securities law violations.""  On Saturday in a tweet, Binance.US said, ""This fight has damaged our business and our reputation but not our fighting spirit or our resolve to defend ourselves against unwarranted charges.""  In a statement also shared Saturday, a Binance spokesperson said, ""Although we maintain that the SEC's request for emergency relief was entirely unwarranted, we are pleased that the disagreement over this request was resolved on mutually acceptable terms. User funds have been and always will be safe and secure on all Binance-affiliated platforms.""  UPDATE (June 17, 2023, 05:50 UTC): Adds further context on the temporary agreement's role in the broader SEC suit.

Given the increasing allure of the cryptocurrency market, it is imperative to scrutinize recent occurrences that affect Bitcoin’s trajectory significantly. This examination will delve into these advancements and their possible ramifications on Bitcoin’s future prospects, particularly their impact on price patterns. Bitcoin’s price witnesses a notable bounce of $1,000 from a critical support level of $25,000, indicating a significant recovery. Dormant Bitcoin holdings, which had remained untouched for over a decade, are suddenly being moved, raising questions about the motives behind these transfers. Bitcoin gains momentum by breaking above a downward trendline resistance level of approximately $26,000, suggesting a bullish market sentiment and potential for further upward movement. Intriguing Movements And Price Implications A notable development has unfolded as a dormant stash of Bitcoin, valued at over $1.2 million, has suddenly come alive after lying dormant for over 13 years. Blockchain data reveals that a whale initiated a transfer of 50 BTC to another wallet on Thursday. These particular coins were originally mined in June 2010 and have remained untouched. This recent movement follows a trend of previously inactive Bitcoin being set into motion. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Up Today? In April, a remarkable event occurred when an investor, who had held their coins for a decade, transferred a staggering $7.8 million worth of Bitcoin to new wallets. Just days later, another long-term investor or group of investors moved $11 million worth of the digital asset after 11 years of inactivity. The movement of these long-dormant Bitcoin holdings raises intriguing questions about the motivations behind such transfers. Additionally, the heightened interest and trading activity stemming from these movements can impact the dynamics of supply and demand, potentially exerting a significant influence on the overall price of Bitcoin in the near term. Bitcoin Breaking Resistance And Bullish Prospects Bitcoin has exhibited a surge in momentum as it successfully broke above significant downward trendline resistance, around $26,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Prices May Drop But DigiToads Presale Investors Are Ready for a 3X Surge From a technical perspective, a closer examination of the four-hour timeframe reveals that Bitcoin has surpassed the crucial resistance level of $26,000. This level carries both psychological significance and is bolstered by a downtrend line. The closure of candles above the $26,200 level signifies a prevailing bullish sentiment in the market. Moreover, BTC peaked at approximately $26,450 before undergoing a minor bearish correction. However, it found support at the previously tested resistance level of $26,250, which now acts as a support level. With candles closing above the $26,200 mark, the bullish trend may continue, with the next resistance level at $26,850 as the target.

The world's largest asset manager on Thursday filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to establish a spot bitcoin ETF, to be known as the iShares Bitcoin Trust. The filing named Coinbase ( COIN ) as the custodian for the ETF's holdings. If approved, it would be the first publicly traded spot bitcoin ETF in the country. The news appeared like a shot in the arm to bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), sending it up nearly 3% on Friday. Other cryptocurrencies rose, with ethereum ( ETH-USD ) also gaining around 3% . Earlier on Thursday, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) had slumped to a three-month low and was hovering around the $25K level, weighed down by continued concerns over regulatory crackdowns. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held interest rates steady for the first time after ten consecutive increases. However, the central bank's dot plot signaled further rate hikes to come, which could have also put some pressure on cryptocurrencies. Like other risk assets, prices of digital tokens are sensitive to interest-rate moves in that they generally fare well when policymakers cut rates. Several analysts earlier this week weighed in with their opinions on the implications of the central bank’s hawkish pause for crypto-market investors. Cryptocurrencies last week fell after the SEC issued back-to-back lawsuits against Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, and Coinbase ( COIN ). In light of the regulator's continued crackdown on crypto entities, crypto traders will be interested in seeing how BlackRock ( BLK ) gets approval for its proposed ETF. The total crypto market cap currently stands at $1.06T, an increase of 2.47% over Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap . Other Notable Crypto News According to a CoinShares report released on Monday, digital asset investment products last week logged a capital flight of $88M, representing the eighth consecutive week of outflows. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor in a Bloomberg Television interview on Tuesday predicted that cryptocurrency market share was set to nearly double from current levels, citing several reasons including an ""explosion in the hash rate"" and ""the clarity that has come out of the SEC as of late."" According to a New York Times report on Tuesday citing a hearing in Washington, a district judge has urged Binance and the SEC to confer on a possible deal that would enable the cryptocurrency exchange's purported U.S. affiliate to keep operating in the country. Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) supply on cryptocurrency exchanges has dropped to its lowest level since February 2018 as heightened regulatory scrutiny of the space has seemingly driven traders to move their BTC to self-custody, according to on-chain data from market intelligence platform Santiment. Mizuho Securities on Thursday said it suspected that Coinbase ( COIN ) was losing some retail crypto trading business to Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ), possibly due to COIN's higher fees on small-ticket trades. Bitcoin, Ether Prices Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rose ~3% to $26.33K at 2000 ET and ether ( ETH-USD ) was up 3.1% to $1.72K.
