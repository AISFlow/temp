13401158,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=226580,1643585457,Web3 Innovations Are Taking the Place of Middlemen,"Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has ushered in a new era for cryptocurrency, attracting a large number of newcomers. It lets users avoid paying high fees by lending their money out and earning interest on the assets they own. The surge in DeFi initiatives demonstrates how far the DeFi revolution may go in disrupting established lending methods and giving customers more power. Developers are extracting value from protocols, rather than enterprises extracting value from users, thanks to the DeFi revolution. Cryptocurrencies and the broader blockchain ecosystem are helping to transform how we live our lives. Because of these new technologies, Web3 is being hailed as a permissionless and open innovation platform based on middleware blockchain protocols. They are displacing intermediary software-as-a-service (SaaS) firms and extracting more revenue as a result. Now, before going into further details, let us first understand what Web3 is. What is Web3? Web3 is supposed to liberate the world from monopolistic control. Web3 refers to a blockchain-based decentralized online ecosystem. Platforms and apps built on Web3 will not be owned by a centralized gatekeeper, but rather by users who will earn ownership stakes by contributing to the development and maintenance of those services. In 2014, Gavin Wood coined the term Web3 (originally Web 3.0). At the time, he had just finished working on Ethereum, the cryptocurrency that is second only to...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/web3-innovations-are-taking-the-place-of-middlemen/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42375401,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7diV,1643585212,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Barely Budges in Weekend Trading,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin moved little as major markets in Asia head into the weeklong lunar New Year break.  Technician's take: BTC is stabilizing between $30K and $40K as oversold conditions remain intact.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $38,033 +0.1%  Ether (ETH): $2,617 +1.1%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Polygon MATIC +8.6% Smart Contract Platform Algorand ALGO +5.0% Smart Contract Platform Polkadot DOT +4.3% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM −5.4% Smart Contract Platform  Markets  S&P 500: 4,431 +2.4%  DJIA: 34,725 1.65%  Nasdaq: 13,770 +3.1%  Gold: $1,792 -0.2%  Market moves  Bitcoin moved little over the weekend with light trading volume as the majority of the markets in Asia head to the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday.  At the time of publication, the oldest cryptocurrency is changing hands at over $38,100, up slightly over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading over $2,600 up slightly over the same period.  Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s trading volume across major crypto exchanges sank significantly over the weekend compared with the past week.  The lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, is the new year based on the traditional lunisolar calendar of China. It is celebrated by many countries in Asia and the celebration usually lasts for weeks. Major stock indexes in China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore are closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, with most traders taking the time off for family reunions.  While the crypto market is 24/7, trading activities in Asia may see some reduction in the coming week due to the holidays.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holds Support Above $35K; Resistance Near $40K  Bitcoin (BTC) buyers have maintained support at the Jan. 24 low of $32,900, and then held above $35,000 over the past few days. Short-term momentum is improving on intraday charts, which could keep buyers active.  Still, longer-term indicators are neutral/bearish, which could limit upside at the $40,000-$43,000 resistance zone.  For now, the relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly chart is approaching oversold levels, similar to what occurred in March 2020, which preceded a price rally. This time, however, the monthly chart indicates strong selling pressure that could maintain BTC’s intermediate-term downtrend.  On the daily chart, the RSI has risen from oversold levels since Jan. 22, which could attract short-term buyers.  For confirmation, traders could monitor the Nasdaq 100 Index of stocks, which has short-term support at $14,000. An oversold bounce in traditional markets could be a near-term positive for crypto prices as correlations rise.

Bitcoin has lost 50% of its value since November. This isn&apos;t unusual for a cryptocurrency; it went through a similar slump from April to July 2021, and then immediately recovered. From a statistical standpoint, Bitcoin appears to be a high-volatility asset with no clear medium- or long-term trending or reverting patterns. It&apos;s not a completely random walk in which the future path is unaffected by previous price fluctuations, but it&apos;s closer than most major assets. Bitcoin Lacks &apos;Economic Anchor&apos; Due to its volatile nature and the market-wide correction in crypto, there has been a lot of criticism going around regarding digital assets (especially Bitcoin), all over the internet. The recent one came from Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of &apos;Black Swan&apos;, who sent out a tweet that went viral. He said: &apos;For a contagion-driven asset with no economic anchor such as #BTC, a falling price does not make it &apos;cheaper&apos; and more attractive. A falling price makes it less desirable [and], paradoxically, more [expensive]. Why? Because the price is its only information.&apos; This is not the case experimentally over the brief history of Bitcoin. Buying Bitcoin when the price was falling was just as appealing as buying it when the price was climbing in the past.
