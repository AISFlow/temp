42379839,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Ktkd,1504216813,Illinois Launches Blockchain Pilot to Digitize Birth Certificates,"The state of Illinois has begun work on a new blockchain pilot focused on the digitization of birth certificates.  Working with blockchain identity startup Evernym, the tools being designed would, if put into production, allow parents and doctors present at the time of birth to officially log the birth on a permissioned blockchain.  But the project, which forms part of the state's broader blockchain efforts, is about more than just birth certificates.  According to Jennifer O'Rourke, who serves as Illinois' blockchain business liaison, the platform being designed could ultimately lead to a broader identity tool-set that a person can use over the years.  O'Rourke told CoinDesk:  ""In this pilot, businesses and governments would be able to verify and authenticate a citizen’s identity by requesting encrypted access to verifiable claims.""  Within the proposed framework, existing government agencies would be able to verify a person's registration information at birth, then cryptographically sign data related to a person's name, date of birth, blood type, and other details.  That information is expected to be stored on a tamper-proof distributed ledger that would only be accessible with consent from a legal guardian – up until the age that the person becomes a legal adult.  At this early stage in the pilot development, efforts are being focused on creating a user interface that parents and doctors can use to digitize the birth certificate, as well as enabling other back-office processes that come into place.  The tools being developed build on work done by a task force within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), according to a statement.  O'Rourke expects the pilot to be completed in ""the near term,"" with a formal announcement scheduled to be made next month at the MyData2017 Conference in Helsinki, Finland.  “We’re going to start with that child, then we want to make sure that we capture that information for the parent, and also for the doctor as well,” said O’Rourke, explaining what she believes is the end-value of moving the data to a blockchain:  ""Those input points should not be static or paper-based.""

According to data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the price of the cryptocurrency hit a high of $4,802.74, before falling back to levels seen over the past few hours of trading.  At press time, the price of bitcoin is trading at roughly $4,762, per data from the BPI.  The push above $4,800 continued gains seen earlier today, when bitcoin once again crossed $4,700 to hit a new all-time high. That milestone was buoyed by an overall lift in cryptocurrency prices that pushed the collective market capitalization above $170 billion for the first time.  Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs chief technician Sheba Jafari wrote in a note to clients that bitcoin prices could surge above $4,800 in the trading sessions to come – though she cautioned that the push had the potential to fall to as low as $3,000 or below. At the time, the cryptocurrency was trading around $4,300.

The site is accessible through the domain btc-e.nz, though it appears that users in some parts of the world, including the U.S., are not able to log in. CoinDesk was able to access the domain through the use of a virtual private network, or VPN.  For now, users appear to be limited to being able to check their funds balances and post messages in the BTC-e chat box.  In a post on the Bitcoin Talk forum yesterday, a representative for the exchange said that user access would form part of a broader relaunch plan that will see BTC-e rebrand under the auspices of what they say will be a regulated investment firm.  At press time, 3,239 users of the site are logged in, according to statistics posted on the BTC-e page.  As CoinDesk previously reported, Greek authorities – acting on a US warrant – arrested a Russian national last month who they alleged helped operated the BTC-e exchange – an accusation that representatives for BTC-e later denied.  After its domain had been seized and an indictment was handed down by US prosecutors, those left in control took to a long-used Bitcoin Talk account to announce a revival plan. Part of that plan, as reported at the time, involves the launch of a debt token aimed at recouping some of the losses for users.  An update on the new BTC-e page recommended that users reset their security settings, given the recent moves by US authorities.

42379843,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KtoP,1504206914,F2Pool Reneges: Bitcoin Pool Pulls Segwit2x Support Over Hard Fork,"Chinese mining pool F2Pool no longer supports the controversial scaling agreement Segwit2x.  Though the proposal has garnered support from many large bitcoin companies and the majority of mining pools, many take issue with its aim to boost bitcoin capacity by way of a hard fork, a mechanism that could lead the cryptocurrency to split into separate blockchain networks.  Tension has been high with developers already hotly debating the merits of the hard fork (a grassroots movement has sprung up in opposition as well), even though the change is not slated for more than two months from now.  Although F2Pool was an original signatory of the agreement, its operator Wang Chun is now among the proposal's detractors.  In an email, Chun told CoinDesk:  ""No. I don't support [the] Segwit2x hard fork.""  Chun went on to add that F2Pool did not run the Segwit2x codebase, BTC1, for the first part of the agreement, when mining pools rallied around the long-debated code optimization Segregated Witness (SegWit).  Representatives from Segwit2x were not immediately available to comment on whether the mining pool has alerted the rest of the group or formally withdrawn from the agreement.  Supporters remain  While F2Pool has flipped, however, other mining pools seem to be steadfast, again, most claiming they'll follow through with Segwit2x.  ""We are strong supporters of the New York Agreement (Segwit2X). We support scaling bitcoin and doing so responsibly. We hope that the hard fork part of Segwit2X will also be upheld,"" said BTCC CEO Bobby Lee.  Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov echoed this sentiment, saying, ""The initial agreement for SegWit2x has not changed.""  Even with support still high, major mining pool Slush Pool, who did not sign the agreement when it was orignally released, remains undecided.  Marek Palatinus, co-founder and CEO of SatoshiLabs and Slush Pool founder, told CoinDesk, the reason for their indecision is the hard fork. Yet, he didn't seem pressed to make a decision since the hard fork is still months away.  Do miners matter?  There's been much debate about how much mining pool support matters, and how much power the Segwit2x group has over decision-making.  Some bitcoin developers argue that users don't follow mining pools, rather, mining pools chase cryptocurrencies that are the most profitable, typically those with the most users and demand.  Bitcoin cash, the cryptocurrency that split from bitcoin on August 1, provides an interesting and complex case study. Mining pools, such as ViaBTC, arguably played a big role in launching the cryptocurrency, yet most mining pools only seem to be mining bitcoin cash to make a profit.  But the allegation is Segwit2x is still pushing the narrative that miner support is necessary, arguing that because so much mining power supports its change (roughly 85% now with F2Pool and Slush Pool out), it's the correct decision for the future of bitcoin.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x agreement, and has an ownership stake in BTCC.

It's the first indication that signs of possible curbs on the growth of ICOs in China is having an impact on the local ecosystem.  CoinDesk reported last week that officials could pursue more oversight over domestic ICOs following the release of new fundraising rules. Chinese media later reported that, in mid-August, a group of regulators, including representatives from the People's Bank of China, met to discuss possible steps to curb ICOs which include limits on the amount of money that can be raised through a single token sale.

A representative for Moscow Exchange told CoinDesk that reports about the firm being on the cusp of launching cryptocurrency trading aren't the result of any immediate statement by the company or its executives. Rather, they were prompted by comments by Alexey Moiseev, Russia's deputy finance minister, who earlier this week opined that cryptocurrency trading in the country should be limited to certain investors who participate through regulated exchanges, later mentioning the Moscow Stock Exchange as an example.  Still, the exchange is open to the idea, telling CoinDesk that it is an area it's observing ""extremely closely.""  ""While it is too early to confirm specific plans today, we are considering all options,"" a spokesperson said.  Notably, Moscow Exchange said it currently lacks a legal framework that would enable it to list products that may include cryptocurrencies, crypto assets, cryptocurrency ETFs and more.  The representative said:  ""We are in principle ready to organize trading in any financial products, where we see that there is sufficient demand from the market and when the corresponding legal framework and investor protections are in place.""  Still, Moiseev's comments suggest that trading participation limits could become a reality one day, suggesting that proposals are being discussed – though it's not clear when any rules might be developed, given continued work on past legislative initiatives related to cryptocurrency.  ""I hope that we will soon submit this concept to the government, and in case of support we will write a draft of normative acts,"" Moiseev said in an interview with RSN.

According to Buterin and the VEB, a deal has actually been struck with a new entity, Ethereum Russia, which is being created for the partnership.

42379851,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KtxD,1504191568,'Game of Skill': US Markets Tech Provider Launches Bitcoin Betting Game,"A new ""game of skill"" centered around bitcoin's price changes is going live.  Launched by Chicago-based Level Trading Field, Bitcoin Market Predictor now allows users to place bets on the future price movements of bitcoin, adding to a growing list of mechanisms U.S. investors can use to speculate on bitcoin's price – whether it's going up or down.  While most of the mechanisms to short bitcoin, at least in the US, are aimed at institutional investors, Bitcoin Market Predictor is notably targeted towards retail investors. Each game costs only $50 to play.  In an exclusive interview, Lanre Sarumi, CEO of Level Trading Field, whose corporate clients include users at Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays, explained why he believes the game is so important to U.S. retail investors.  Sarumi told CoinDesk:  ""If you believe the price is going to go down, how do you make that bet? Right now, there are really no tools available to let you.""  And there's truth to Sarumi's statements. While several global exchange's allow users to short bitcoin, only Coinbase's GDAX exchange offers such functionality to US residents, though the shorting feature is currently disabled, pending GDAX's review of unusual price movements in ethereum in June.  Let's play  So, how does it work? The game is structured so that groups of 10 are segmented into a game, with users placing bets about the price of bitcoin at the top of the hour. The top three most accurate predictions share the pot, which for each game (after Level Trading Field's 10 percent fee) leaves $450 to split.  The closest guess gets 50 percent of the pot ($225), the runner-up gets 30 percent ($135), and the second runner-up receives 20 percent ($90).  While gambling on games and chance is prohibited under Illinois law, Samuri said his company's prediction game, which is similar in some ways to fantasy sports betting, is permitted because it is a game of skill.  Level Trading Field uses price data provided by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as the reference data for the game. CME data combines four different bitcoin exchanges - Bitstamp, Coinbase's GDAX, itBit and Kraken - in order to normalize price data.  In order to further minimize the effects of price volatility, Level Trading Field applies additional logic to the final price used to benchmark the winning bid. The company will store all of the tick data for the final minute of each game, and then averages it to determine the winning bid.

However, Schroder pointed out some issues he has with Lightning – which he hopes will provide ""real-time micropayments"" – including that its invoice protocol BOLT 11 does not appear to accommodate refunds. Refunds are a necessity for the bitcoin fuel dispenser, because it runs on a fixed prepayment, and immediately returns any unused credit at the end of sale, he said.  Schroder is currently using bitcoin improvement protocol (BIP) 70, a user-friendly payment protocol that creates a receipt for the customer, as well as automatically providing a refund address to the seller.  He stated in the mailing list:  ""I don't really see an option for a refund address like is present in BIP 70. Is this intentional?

42400341,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJKNp,1504173622,ICO M&A? Token Exits Could Get Messy,"Ash Egan is a venture capitalist at early-stage investment firm Converge, where he lead the firm's investment in blockchain startups Chainalysis and Enigma.  In this opinion article, Egan outlines how the issuance of a publicly traded cryptographic token might affect the ability of a startup to be bought or acquired later.      Today, entrepreneurs are flocking to the green pastures made possible by token sales, a relatively new way to bring capital into an early-stage tech company. In fact, ICOs and token sales have outpaced traditional venture funding, not only for blockchain companies, but for all companies, according to Goldman Sachs.  Given this traction, it's easy to dismiss the cryptocurrency and token markets as a bubble: Peter Schiff and Howard Marks have each voiced their concerns in the space.  However, there is enormous value in issuing tokens, and there are reasons token sales are booming.  These include:  Entrepreneurs can bring in millions without embarking on the typical months-long fundraising roadshow. (Legendary VC Fred Wilson even believes there is a paradigm shift happening.)  Introducing tokens often incentivizes token owners (potential users) to contribute to the network, as they now have a vested interest in the network's success. In this sense, tokens are a solution to a network's chicken-and-egg problem.  Token sales make a company sexy again… Holding an ICO is a sure way to get media attention in 2017. (On the flip side, they may bring the wrong type of investors to the table).  Companies are now able to raise their seed, A, B and C rounds with pre-revenue traction, and can focus exclusively on building the network and recruiting, rather than fundraising.  As a venture investor at Converge focused on crypto and blockchain businesses, I am curious how tokens will affect an acquirer's decision-making. Blockchain company buy-outs, even those without their own tokens are not yet a norm, although we've seen small acquisitions – Skry, Mediachain, CryptoWatch, Bitnet and CleverCoin.  Before retrofitting an M&A framework and jumping into the logistics of how a corporate might purchase company X with blockchain tokens, it's important to know that many of these tokens are governed via a separate entity: i.e. a foundation, often based overseas (exampled below).  Additionally, tokens offer unique properties: some pass the Howey Test (and are considered securities), many are offered via a foundation (not the company), some have immediate utility, while others may not be distributed for months to years following the token sale.  Wary of cryptocurrency FoMO (fear of missing out), corporates are having conversations on how they might acquire a tokenized blockchain company.  Corporates may want to acquire a company for the team, for the large open-source development community, or simply because the corporation finds the build-your-own token process overly cumbersome.  But, while interest is there, corporate M&A teams do not have a status quo to rely on.  Here are five possible viewpoints:  Company has value, tokens are irrelevant  Company has value, tokens seem interesting  Company does not have value, tokens are important to our go-forward  We don’t know which has value, but we want to own it all  This is going to be a regulatory, compliance nightmare — let’s sit this one out.  Scenario 1: Company has value, tokens are irrelevant    ""We want the company, we don't care about the tokens.""    The company owns the patents, the team is superb, but the M&A team does not understand why tokens are necessary for the business or how the tokens merit a high price.  As diligence, the M&A team will try to acquire the company, and ignore the tokens. Just in case, this team will check token sale documents to find out corporate structure of tokens (i.e. was it the C-corp or foundation which issued the tokens?), details on how the team is compensated and token distribution plans. If acquiring tokens is absolutely necessary, the number of tokens issued will likely have a material impact on the exit potential.  If the token market cap is high, and many of these tokens have already been issued, it will be a stretch to see a deal proposed, let alone done.  Scenario 2: Company has value, token has value  The team is great, the technology is great, the protocol makes sense and the team taps into its valuable network of users.  In this instance, there may be an existing relationship between a company and corporation exploring an acquisition. Because most of the activity happening in blockchain is experimental, or the product isn't as far as long as market cap, I think we won't see any corporate pay full equity price plus total outstanding price per token.  The structure of tokens were issued will significantly impact the acquisition price.  Scenario 3: Company does not have value, token does  This company got very lucky in being first to market, but the team is just not up to snuff – maybe there are even signs of fraudulent or malicious activity.  If the market position, developer community and technology are superb, corporates may take an active approach of buying tokens in the wild or even the outstanding tokens.  This is going to be the last strategy an M&A team wants to present to its C-suite.  Scenario 4: We don't know which has value, but we want to own it all  This is the FoMO scenario.  Whatever the reason might be (i.e. a corporation is under pressure from its shareholders and board to develop a blockchain strategy, executives realize they have no one internally who understands blockchain), price sensitivity becomes an afterthought, and the M&A team makes a bid to buy a blockchain token C-corp, alongside outstanding tokens, at current price per token.  Depending on the token acquisition strategy, this scenario could cost billions for the corporation. Biggest question for corporate is what happens to tokens in the wild? And will those token holders remain loyal? Or flock to a competitive blockchain system?  An existing company (say, gambling company Betfair) may shell out $100 million (not $1 billion) for something with regulatory advantages. Companies are clueless about peer-to-peer betting services – let alone blockchain.  Scenario 5: This is going to be a regulatory, compliance nightmare – let's sit this one out  Today's sole corporate strategy for token and C-corp M&A.  The M&A team and C-suite find the landscape difficult to follow, and are worried about losing millions on token volatility, or even how they would go about acquiring token network. Because pricing and acquisitions will be so complex, many corporates will sit on the sidelines and let their competitors dictate price, or may make their own play at the 11th hour.  In this vein, corporates may (Scenario 6) explore potential acquisitions, and ultimately release their own blockchain token, similar to what Kik is doing through Kin Interactive.  Corporates, especially public companies, will drift to Scenario 5 for the next few years, or decide that tokens have immense value and issue their own.  For all of the entrepreneurs thinking of issuing tokens, it's important to understand the downside risk maybe even more so than the benefits of bringing in extra capital. Take the long term view. Ultimately, how would you articulate the value of tokens to your potential buyer?  Other areas corporate M&A teams will analyze, not include above: Who powers the network? Miners?  As entrepreneurs, investors and corporates, we will need to think outside of traditional corporate M&A in the web 3.0 era.

42400322,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJK85,1504170007,EU Politician Pushes Parliament to Test Blockchain Identity for Refugees,"A blockchain task force within the European Parliament wants to explore how the technology could be used to provide digital identities to refugees, public documents suggest.  Amendments  for the European Union's 2018 budget, published on August 29, include one related to a task force first approved last year by EU lawmakers. The document also outlines that, of the more than €850,000 allocated for the project in the 2017 budget, €425,000 has been spent thus far.  Remarks included in that amendment – which appear to be attributed to Jakob von Weizsäcker, the MEP who first proposed the task force – suggest that one particular use case lawmakers are considering relates to digital identity for refugees.  The document reads:  ""One specific use case that ought to be explored is the potential of [distributed ledger tech] based solutions for the management of the situation of refugees. Many refugees, and people in refugee-like situations, are unable to prove their identity or access essential services.""  It further spelled out how lack of a formal ID leave refugees without the necessary documentation to open a bank account, or to access healthcare, schooling, or legal protection.  The news comes amid growing interest among institutions and governments about the potential for blockchain to solve issues that affect displaced peoples.  Earlier this year, CoinDesk reported that the United Nations is conducting a pilot in Jordan, using ethereum to distribute funds to those fleeing the Syrian war. More than 10,000 refugees were involved in that initiative.  Now, at least seven UN agencies are investigating blockchain applications that could help with international assistance, such as identity and micropayments.

42400329,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJKHv,1504166410,Putin Advisor Announces New Blockchain Advocacy Group,"The chief internet advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced the creation of a new association focused on blockchain and cryptocurrency, reports say.  According to local news source RNS, Herman Klimenko revealed the new group – the Russian Association of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (RABIK) – yesterday during an industry discussion regarding the technicalities of initial coin offerings, or ICOs.  Set up to promote blockchain technologies in ""government and commercial structures,"" the association will also work to develop a dialogue with regulators over the ""legitimization"" of the technology, RNS said.    According to a statement by the Institute for Internet Development (IRI), RABIK is aimed at blockchain technologists, miners, cryptocurrency holders and ICO investors, and will allow participants certain advantages in the industry.      The IRI specified:    ""Participants of the association, among other things, will be given various preferences, including from manufacturers of equipment for creating cryptocurrencies, the opportunity to present their technologies to potential consumers and participate in major state events,""  Blockchain discussion in Russia is currently in full swing. Conversations are underway as to whether to implement a nationwide cryptocurrency, with First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov pledging his support.  Taking a more severe stance, Russia's deputy finance minister, Alexei Moiseev, stated on August 28 that while he felt bitcoin was too unsafe to be traded by civilians, it could be traded on regulated exchanges.
