42432395,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCDph,1595363296,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Briefly Pops Above $9,400 as Global Stocks Rally","Bitcoin hit its highest price point in almost two weeks as stocks climbed.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $9,371 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. EDT). Gaining 2.2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,149-$9,439  BTC above 10-day and 50-day moving average, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin stakeholders were delighted to see green flashes on their screens next to the world’s oldest cryptocurrency Tuesday.      Prices on the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency went as high as $9,439 around 7:00 UTC (3 a.m. EDT), a price not seen since July 9.      “Bitcoin might be waking up,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at London-based crypto brokerage Koine. “A close above $9,600 would be a strong sign.”      Some are just happy to see prices go up in the bitcoin market, which has lacked activity for much of July.      “Nice to finally see a bit of movement,” said Douglas Bilyk, a director at New York-based crypto brokerage Copper. “With lower volumes, it doesn't take as much to push it, and looks like the initial move was up. Now we just need to see some follow-through.”      Major global equities are also showing positive gains today:    The Nikkei 225 in Asia closed in the green 0.73% led by gains in tech stocks SoftBank Group, Nintendo and Sony.  The FTSE 100 in Europe ended the day up 0.13% as the European Union agrees to a stimulus package worth €750 billion.  The U.S. S&P 500 index climbed 0.20% as the banking and travel sectors made gains despite tech stocks mostly heading lower.    Read More: Bitcoin Futures Pass $1B on BitMEX for First Time Since March Crash      Gains in the equity markets appear to have been the catalyst for bitcoin’s positive trading day. “Bitcoin seems pretty correlated to equities at the moment,” Koine’s Douglas told CoinDesk. “The test will be whether BTC can hold up if equities sell off.”      Stock indices have been outperforming bitcoin in July. However, Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, points out that flat markets for the oldest cryptocurrency sometimes can occur.      “This lull isn't uncharacteristic of bitcoin; it spent most of Q1 2019 in a sideways market,” he said.      “Expectations are always running high for performance. And though it's a well-run narrative by now, bitcoin has a tendency to exhibit a high volatility; things will move again,” Shah added.      Read More: Bitcoin Shows Signs of Life But Ether (And Crew) Steal the Limelight    Curve DEX volumes up    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Tuesday, trading around $245 and and climbing 4.4% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).      Ethereum-powered decentralized exchange (DEX) Curve Finance is seeing huge growth in volumes this past week. Curve, at $70 million in volume over the past 24 hours, has overtaken bellwether DEX Uniswap as decentralized finance (DeFi) heats up.      “It is probably a bit of interest picking up in non-bitcoin assets that are becoming multifunctional or yield-enhancing,” said Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading for Chicago-based liquidity provider Blockfills.      Jake Brukhman, managing partner for New York-based crypto asset manager CoinFund, said Curve’s specialization in swapping stablecoins gives the DEX an edge in execution.      When DeFi traders seeking opportunities need to arbitrage stable assets, Curve’s volume increases.      “They are using a mathematical equation which makes slippage very low,” Brukhman said.

ERX is one of six crypto exchanges to receive the license from the Thai SEC since it began regulating the space in 2018.  While other licenced crypto exchanges in the country primarily trade cryptocurrencies, ERX only offers tokenized digital assets for exchange.  The ERX platform was built using New York-based crypto exchange technology provider AlphaPoint’s white label software.  Elevated Returns specializes in digitizing traditional assets with a focus on real estate asset tokenization, and is best known for having tokenized the St Regis luxury resort in Aspen, Colo.  According to a statement, the group has a primary ICO portal license issued by the Thai SEC, as well as an asset management license and a secondary market license.  This means the firm can now issue real estate-backed investment tokens, trade them and “manage funds raised from the public to trade the investment tokens on behalf of investors” in Thailand.  Through its Thai ecosystem, built on the Tezos Proof-of-Stake blockchain, the ER group said it intends to launch several real estate investment tokens to bring over $1 billion worth of assets to the blockchain.

42432391,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCDlh,1595356862,Russia to Treat Crypto as a Taxable Property,"Russia changed its draft bill regulating crypto and digital assets. You won’t go to jail for facilitating crypto deals in the country – at least, not just yet.      Previously, the country’s lawmakers introduced a version of the law that would make any business issuing or trading crypto using Russia-based infrastructure illegal, provoking an outcry from the crypto community and criticism from several government branches.      The new draft is more neutral. It suggests crypto is a kind of property that cannot be accepted as a means of payment. Any lawsuits related to the ownership of crypto can only be considered by the courts if plaintiffs report their crypto holdings and deals for tax purposes.      This might change the currently inconsistent practice in the Russian courts, where there is no universal definition of cryptocurrency.      Read more: Russia Considering Draconian Rules for Illegal Crypto Operations      A digital currency, according to the bill, is a digital set of data that can be used as a payment method or investment tool and has no central party responsible for it, “except for the operator and (or) the nodes of such systems, which are only responsible for maintaining the issuance of the digital data and upending such a system.”      The issuance and flow of crypto in Russia should be regulated by other laws, the bills says. The bill’s sponsor, Anatoly Aksakov, told Russian news agency RIA Novosti more detailed regulations might be passed during the next parliamentary session in the fall.      The bill passed the second hearing today, which is the most important one in the Russian lawmaking process. There are three rounds of hearings for any bill to pass, but after the second one, the text of a bill is considered final. The document, which was initially only dedicated to regulating digital securities, ultimately merely included a mention of digital currency and its basic definition.      The main part of the bill, however, outlines the regulations for assets like digital shares of a company, whether on a distributed ledger or in “another kind of system.” The issuers of such assets should register with the Bank of Russia, and have managers with experience in finance. The issuer of such a system should control it in a centralized way and should be able to amend the ledger in case a court rules so.

""The only thing outright prohibited is taking crypto as payment for goods and services, which was the Bank of Russia's principal premise. But buying a cup of coffee for bitcoin is still a kind of exotic thing anyway,"" Uspensky said.      He added that the current version of the bill is a compromise between the conservatively inclined Bank of Russia, other government bodies and the crypto community.      ""They decided only to mention cryptocurrency in the bill so far and prohibit using it as a payment, but postpone deciding on more important issues, like the criminal cases [related to crypto], crypto [over-the-counter] businesses, and so on,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | WALLET,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/21/russia-to-treat-crypto-as-a-taxable-property,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7874263d3655b05077b4213de8942577748b88e8-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432393,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCDnh,1595349331,Blockchain Bites: China's BSN Integrations and Satoshi's Newfound Wealth,"Crypto firms are cooking up ways to become ""Travel Rule"" compliant, Satoshi's stash got a little bigger and one of Ethereum Classic's top supporters is walking away from the project.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Travel Rule BitGo, Coinbase and other top exchanges are expected to release a white paper next month detailing a type of “bulletin board” meant to help exchanges comply with the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “Travel Rule.” Participants would share addresses on the board and, if another member claims an address, the two entities could then share data P2P to keep personal information out of the reach of hackers. Gemini, Kraken, and Bittrex may also be participating in the Travel Rule working group, according to The Block. Separately, blockchain security firm CoolBitX and on-chain analytics company Elliptic are working together on another “Travel Rule” solution.      Satoshi's Billions Whale Alert found on-chain evidence that Bitcoin’s creator mined approximately 1,125,150 BTC (~$10.9 billion) as the network was getting off the ground. This is up from the 1 million BTC Sergio Demian Lerner initially attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto in 2013, by examining the “extra nonce” patterns thought to be caused by Nakamoto’s mining rig. In a Medium post, researchers describe how Satoshi continued mining with the same rig until at least May 2010, capturing 22,503 of the first 54,316 block rewards.      FYI YFI, the governance token for Yearn.Finance, is the latest DeFi project to capture the attention of yield farmers. The token’s creator Andre Cronje hasn’t set aside any of the tokens for himself and called it “a completely valueless 0 supply token,” in a Medium post. That all tokens are set aside for liquidity providers may have influenced a price run up to $2,374, though the project’s name (an unflattering acronym) and what appears to be a backdoor that could allow Cronje to print an infinite amount of YFI, have raised eyebrows. As of 13:00 UTC today, the price has collapsed to $821.07.      Hard Fork Away One of Ethereum Classic’s largest power providers has voted to abandon the project after an upcoming hard fork. OpenEthereum is the latest client to walk, citing concerns with the blockchain’s immutability, according to a GitHub vote Thursday. Of the 615 current Ethereum Classic nodes listed by ETC Nodes, 425 won’t update in the future as developers make changes via hard forks. OpenEthereum has chosen to shut down support for the original Ethereum mainnet to conserve developer energy for its Ethereum client, formerly known as Parity-Ethereum.      Real-Time Alerts CipherTrace, a blockchain analytics software firm, has deployed a predictive risk-scoring system that the company says provides real-time alerts on suspect crypto transactions for its exchange, investor and investigator clients. The tool will assign risk based on the on-chain histories of transacted funds, the Silicon Valley firm said. Inbound cryptos with unseemly ties (from sanctioned countries or a fraud campaign, for example) would get a “high risk"" score under the system.

Goldman says there’s no record of his employment (Decrypt)  DeFi got a robo-advisor (The Block)  Dr. Seuss comes to the blockchain thanks to the maker of Cryptokitties (TechCrunch)  The big read    China’s Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) took a great leap forward by integrating with six public blockchains. Beginning Aug 10, Tezos, NEO, Nervos, EOS, IRISnet and Ethereum developers will be able to build dapps and run nodes drawing on bandwidth from BSN’s data centers.      The BSN is a toolbox for open source developers to build blockchain applications. Sometimes called the “digital belt and road initiative,” the BSN is an oxymoronic experiment in nation state-led decentralized tech development.      “This is part of China's plan to be the one and only infrastructure provider for blockchain firms around the world,” CoinDesk’s David Pan reports. Evidence of President Xi Jinping’s commitment to “seize” the blockchain opportunity, the BSN reveals lingering contradictions in China’s approach to open source crypto projects.      “The Chinese government and regulators are very cautious about decentralized public chains and try not to get involved in anything related to a public blockchain,” Hongfei Da, founder of NEO, said. “It is interesting to see BSN, which has a clear commercial purpose and is backed by entities with government background, is supporting such projects.”    Market intel    Correlation Data Point Bitcoin jumped from $9,190 to $9,360 in early morning trading, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, after European Union leaders announced a €750 billion post-pandemic fiscal stimulus plan. This is another data point showing correlation between Bitcoin and traditional equities, as some major European equity indices are up at least 1.5% each, while Germany’s DAX index has nearly erased losses incurred during the coronavirus-led market tumble.      ETH's Real Value? Ether’s total market capitalization stands at about $26 billion, if you’re not taking into account all of the digital assets built atop the Ethereum blockchain. The combined value of ERC-20-standard tokens – which include stablecoins like tether, altcoins like Chainlink’s LINK and DeFi darlings like Kyber’s KNC – is around $26 billion, according to the data provider Messari. Including all these assets, the Ethereum ecosystem’s market cap is around $50 billion – closer to bitcoin’s $170 billion than if ether were considered alone. “The comparison shows how the rapid pace of development this year on Ethereum has brought the blockchain’s ecosystem closer to challenging Bitcoin. The value gap narrowed over the past month as bitcoin’s price stagnated, while demand for stablecoins and a flurry of activity in DeFi has ignited the value of Ethereum and the tokens that depend on it,” CoinDesk’s First Mover reports.

It called itself “the world computer” and it promised to transform not just cryptocurrencies as we knew it, but the very idea of what could be done with cryptography and consensus. Ethereum had arrived.      From its technical aspirations to unicorns and memes, Ethereum is a culture on its own. It has spawned blockchain uses — from digital cats to yield farming — previously unimagined.      Ethereum is at a crossroads. But it must complete an ambitious and fraught retooling of its foundations — the long awaited move to Ethereum 2.0 — to keep up with the market’s demands.      CoinDesk is marking the milestone with Ethereum at Five: a cross-platform series comprising a series of special coverage, a pop-up newsletter and live-streamed discussions. New issues and sessions launch daily from July 27-31. Register for CoinDesk Live and our pop-up newsletter.    Opinion    Surprise Attack? Brenna Smith, an open source researcher and contributor for the investigative website Bellingcat, thinks no one should be surprised that Twitter was hacked last week, least of all Twitter. For years, celebrity impersonations and crypto scams have run rampant on the platform, without any meaningful redress. “Essentially since Bitcoin’s inception, cyber criminals and scammers have capitalized on the currency to funnel proceeds from emails scams, fake websites, and propositions on chat forums. Then, they began leveraging major social media platforms and impersonating celebrities. Mainstream social media platforms and celebrities provide two critical ingredients to a lucrative hack: a large audience and a semblance of credibility,” she writes.

42432389,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCDjh,1595346778,Ethereum at Five: How CoinDesk Is Marking This Week's Milestone,"Five years ago, a wildly ambitious project went live. Its creators envisioned a “world computer” that would transform not just money but a vast range of social interactions, pushing the boundaries of what could be done with cryptography and distributed consensus. Ethereum had arrived.      From its technical aspirations to unicorn memes, Ethereum is a culture on its own. It has spawned inventions – from digital cats to yield farming – previously unimagined and now faces a major overhaul – Eth 2.0 – to keep up with the market’s demands.      CoinDesk is marking the milestone with Ethereum at Five, a cross-platform series featuring special coverage, a limited-run newsletter and live-streamed discussions on Twitter. New issues and sessions launch daily from July 27-31.      Oh, and watch out for the Easter eggs.    Register for CoinDesk Live sessions July 27-31  Ethereum at Five Newsletter    Each morning during the event, our editorial team will publish a newsletter that covers the waterfront from Ethereum’s culture and lifestyle to innovations like decentralized apps, DAOs, decentralized finance and enterprise solutions, and closes out by asking the big questions about the hotly anticipated Ethereum 2.0.      Don’t know what any of that means? Led by editors Marc Hochstein, Elaine Ramirez, Christie Harkin and Zack Seward, our limited-run newsletter will be packed with educational content that eases the newbie into Ethereum, while offering the thoughtful deep-dives loyal CoinDesk readers know and love.      CoinDesk reporters and analysts Ian Allison, Leigh Cuen, Brady Dale, Nate DiCamillo, Will Foxley, Christine Kim and Hoa Nguyen will guide readers through the five years of Ethereum’s evolution, including Ethereum’s efforts to upend the banking industry, its challenges in scalability and enterprise adoption, its Woodstock moment and its status as a global lifestyle brand.      Meanwhile, we’ll provide bite-sized lessons to ease readers into the concepts of smart contracts, enterprise blockchain, yield farming and more and offer recommended reading from the CoinDesk vault.    CoinDesk Live    Our live-streamed discussions welcome DeFi pioneers Hayden Adams and Robert Leshner, “The Infinite Machine” author Camila Russo and former ConsenSys exec Andrew Keys.      Sessions kick off daily at 4 p.m. ET and will be live-streamed on social media and the CoinDesk homepage. We’re hosting a Discord community to keep attendees engaged throughout the week.      On top of that, we set up a hotline at +1 (661) 4-UNICRN (+1-661-486-4276) to share tidbits of the Ethereum history and culture through untold stories. Go ahead, call us.

Evans, Andrew Keys    Ethereum prides itself on its inclusive, unicorns-and-rainbows vibe, which is a far cry from the libertarian, cypherpunk, mountain-man culture of Bitcoin. Come for a discussion about how this diverse, freewheeling and extremely social approach to software development made Ethereum what it is today. Stay for fun memories from a panel of veteran Ethereans from their nonstop global tour of conferences, meetups and festivals.      $55 Million Shockwave: How the DAO Hack Changed Ethereum – Tuesday, July 28, 4 p.m. ET    Speakers: Griff Green, Emin Gun Sirer, Matt Leising, Taylor Monahan    The theft, the chain split, the legal aftermath – perhaps no single event shaped Ethereum's trajectory as much as the DAO hack of 2016. Bloomberg's Matt Leising sits down with the key protagonists to reflect on the events and their after-effects four years on.      Ethereum's Bankless Bankers – Wednesday, July 29, 4 p.m. ET    Speakers: Hayden Adams, Rune Christensen, Will Foxley, Robert Leshner    Smart contracts were supposed to substitute signatures with software. These ideas have gone from science fiction to a $3 billion market, thanks to the boom in so-called decentralized finance built on Ethereum. An unlikely crew has emerged as the leading figures of this movement. We'll talk to them about how we wound up here.      Year Zero: From Those Who Were There – Thursday, July 30, 4 p.m. ET    Speakers: Anthony Di Iorio, Anthony D’Onofrio, Adam Levine, Camila Russo, Ken Seiff    Getting the “world computer” operational was no easy task.

42432383,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCDTh,1595341809,Singapore May Extend Crypto Regulation to Include Overseas Activities,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is seeking to extend its oversight to include cryptocurrency activities outside of its jurisdiction.    A proposal from the city-state's central bank would effectively extend the provisions set by the 2019 Payment Services Act (PSA) to include the overseas activities of locally based crypto companies or individuals.  That means virtual asset service providers (VASPs) will be obliged to run their overseas activities to the same regulatory standards as their Singapore operations.  Per the consultation paper, MAS argues the proposal would stop regulatory arbitrage in which multinational VASPs cherry-pick the regulation that best suits their businesses.  This would also align Singapore closer to the anti-money laundering recommendations set last year by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international watchdog.  VASPs affected will be those that work overseas but have a ""meaningful presence"" in Singapore – that is, if their offices and directors are based in the jurisdiction.  Further, a company representative would have to be present and answerable to the Singapore regulator at all times.  MAS originally floated the idea of extending PSA soon after it was ratified in December 2019.  A public consultation period is open until Aug. 20, 2020.

Peirce, whose liberal fintech stances have earned her the nickname ""Crypto Mom,"" told Blockchain Association Singapore the SEC fundamentally erred in prosecuting and punishing Telegram's gram token sale, which raised $1.2 billion in now-forfeited funds for the messaging app as per a settlement last month.  In her view, Telegram's decision to sell grams under a ""Simple Agreement for Future Tokens"" offering structure should have protected the project from securities violations. But, as she pointed out, the SEC saw it differentl, and worked to convince a court that the agreements for future gram tokens counted as securities.  ""I do not support the message that distributing tokens inherently involves a securities transaction. What the SEC’s Telegram complaint cast as evidence of an illegal securities offering – that 'the project would require ‘numerosity’: a widespread distribution and use of grams across the globe,' I see as a necessary prerequisite for any successful blockchain network,"" she said.  Peirce again called for a ""safe harbor"" that would give certain token projects three years to experiment while regulators retooled their framework for what is and is not an investment contract.

42432380,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCDJh,1595340321,China's Blockchain Infrastructure to Extend Global Reach With Six Public Chains,"The Takeaway:    China's state-backed Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) has integrated with six public chains including Tezos, NEO, Nervos, EOS, IRISnet and Ethereum.  Developers on these six blockchains will be able to build dapps and run nodes using data storage and bandwidth from BSN’s overseas data centers starting Aug 10.  This is part of China's plan to be the one and only infrastructure provider for blockchain firms around the world.  Global users will have access to China’s enterprise chains and financial data via the network's cross-chain structure and partnership with China UnionPay.    A blockchain infrastructure backed by the Chinese government will open its services to decentralized applications (dapp) developers on a global scale on August 10.      The move is part of China’s plan to be the one and only infrastructure provider for blockchain firms across the world. That effort resembles the country’s aggressive international expansion in other major emerging technologies such as 5G and artificial intelligence.      This global expansion is notable, given that China’s attempts to lead in other technologies have been disrupted. The Trump administration issued a new rule in May to prevent Chinese tech conglomerate Huawei, a leader in 5G technology, and its suppliers from using U.S. technology and software. The U.K. has also barred Huawei from its 5G networks.      Yet, China’s global blockchain ambitions have been a smooth sail.      The global version of Blockchain-Based Services Network (BSN) has integrated its data centers with six major decentralized blockchains: Tezos, NEO, Nervos, Cosmos’ IRISnet, Ethereum and EOS. The developers on these public chains can run nodes and applications using data storage, bandwidth and other resources provided by BSN.      The public chains could benefit from BSN’s cheap services, interoperability with other Chinese enterprise blockchains and access to financial data from China UnionPay, which is otherwise difficult for foreign-based blockchain firms to obtain and process.      “The move is a milestone as BSN is the first state-backed blockchain infrastructure that is reaching developer communities outside China by integrating with major public chains,” said Yifan He, CEO of Beijing Red Date Technology, one of the founding companies behind BSN.      Read More: Inside China’s Plan to Power Global Blockchain Adoption      The nationwide blockchain infrastructure project was launched in April. It is led by the State Information Center of China (SIC) and supported by state-owned tech conglomerates China Mobile and China UnionPay, and Red Date, which architects BSN’s technical framework.      SIC is a public institution under the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the highest economic planning agency in the Chinese government. The institution has been one of the principal architects behind China’s national information security policies, and monitors and processes macroeconomic data for policymakers.      The six blockchain projects are BSN’s first batch of decentralized public blockchains to run on the network across its three data centers in Paris, San Francisco and Hong Kong, He said.      “We’ve taken a lot of thoughts about who would be the first public chains to be integrated,” He said. “Besides Ethereum and EOS we have disclosed in April, we decided to include another international public chain Tezos, and two prominent China-originated projects NEO and Nervos.”      BSN aims to on-board more than 10 public chains by the end of this year based on their user bases, technical background and products, He said.    Cloud services for blockchain    Guoning Lü, co-founder of Nervos, said BSN can support a tailored infrastructure service for blockchain developers, noting that projects need to be able to run nodes on such an infrastructure to operate.      “Essentially, blockchain firms are using standardized internet services from BSN as opposed to adjusting their own technical frameworks to use such services,” Lü said.      The standardized development environment could save a lot of time and money for developers from building things from scratch, Lü said.      “For example, validation nodes require a high level of security protection to prevent them from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks (one of the most common cyber attacks that make a network unavailable to its users),” Harriet Cao, co-founder of IRISnet Foundation, said.      BSN will hide the complexities of these security features in its operation support. In the future, a developer can use BSN to run a node like people use cloud services, and developers can just search the name of the blockchain and hold their private keys in order to build dapps or run a node, Cao said.      Developers will enjoy free services on BSN if they have fewer than 2,000 daily connection requests to BSN’s nodes. Red Date Technology’s Yifan He claims that BSN will be much more cost-effective and stable than other networks for dapp developers.      There are free nodes for blockchain projects but they tend to be unstable and hard to trace once a dapp loses connections to the nodes. Many dapps buy services from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and build their own nodes in the data centers.      For one single node on anetwork like Alibaba Cloud, developers would have to pay tens of thousands of dollars per year plus the cost of human resources in order to maintain the node. In contrast, BSN will only charge several hundred dollars for the yearly resources and operational services needed to run nodes, He said.    APIs    While there are only six public chains, users will have more than a dozen options to be connected with BSN’s nodes.      All six chains will have nodes assigned to their mainnet and testnet respectively, where developers can first run their applications on testnets and find potential problems to ensure a frictionless experience on their mainnets.      While all the chains will be able to be connected to the nodes via their native application programming interfaces (API), Ethereum and EOS developers can opt for API services provided by a third-party blockchain middleware firm dfuse.      For Ethereum and EOS, there will be mainnet nodes, testnet nodes and dfuse nodes with their own special API infrastructure attached to the nodes.      ""While dfuse could offer faster and more convenient connections with the nodes on BSN, we make sure the developers with privacy concerns can still opt for native APIs,” He said.      Read More: How Chainlink and Cosmos Fit Into China’s Grand Blockchain Initiative      Dfuse, Founded in 2018, is a Montreal, Canada-based firm that started off by providing API services to EOS-based applications. It later branched out to projects on Ethereum.      “One of the main reasons that BSN chose us is we are very scalable,” Alexandre Bourget, dfuse co-founder and chief technology officer, said. “dfuse has been built and stress-tested on public chains processing 5,000 sustained/10,000 burst transactions per second, and is ready to support the next 10x and 100x in industry growth.”      The firm has been funded by Multicoin Capital and Intel Capital, which is the investing arm of Intel Corporation.    One network, two systems    Developers can build dapps on the six public chains in BSN’s global version. Domestic users in mainland China, however, only have access to enterprise blockchains due to Chinese government’s restrictions on decentralized public chains that tend to have tokens.      “The Chinese government and regulators are very cautious about decentralized public chains and try not to get involved in anything related to a public blockchain,” Hongfei Da, founder of NEO, said. “It is interesting to see BSN, which has a clear commercial purpose and is backed by entities with government background, is supporting such projects.”      “It is like ByteDance behind TikTok,” Da said. “The international version of the app does not necessarily comply with the Chinese regulation but the local regulations from the countries [where] it is used. BSN reflects a common pragmatic approach for Chinese companies to go global.”      BSN can serve as a way for non-Chinese blockchain firms to tap into the Chinese blockchain community.      Developers outside China can now use many major Chinese enterprise blockchains to build their dapps, such as Tencent’s consortium chain FISCO-BISCO used for its virtual bank WeBank, according to He.      ""We’re thrilled for Tezos to join a cohort of public blockchains that will provide the base layer for companies and software developers building blockchain-based applications in China and globally,” Hubertus Thonhauser, chairman of the Tezos Foundation Council, said. “Participating in the BSN is a momentous step forward on the path to wide-scale institutional adoption for the Tezos project.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/21/chinas-blockchain-infrastructure-to-extend-global-reach-with-six-public-chains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94eaa49cfd506db65ce0368c909f741d0b3ad47b-1000x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The connection to the Silvergate Exchange Network will give ErisX clients access to U.S. dollar withdrawals and deposits during business hours. The Silvergate Exchange Network is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  “If you think about the traditional means of moving fiat today, most institutional market participants would utilize the Fedwire system,” ErisX CEO Thomas Chippas said in an interview. “You’re talking about the availability of getting your money around 4:30 p.m. or 5 p.m. in the afternoon depending on the bank.”  ErisX is one of the few exchanges to have publicly announced its integration with the SEN. In November, Kraken announced it had joined the SEN to enable real-time fund transfer.  Chippas noted the fee structure is no more expensive on SEN than what it would be for a typical Fedwire transfer.  While ErisX is evaluating the SEN Leverage product, which allows proprietary traders to put up bitcoin as collateral for fiat loans, the exchange hasn’t yet decided to offer the service to its clients, Chippas said.  In the first quarter of 2020, the SEN handled 31,405 transactions, according to the publicly-traded Silvergate’s most recent earnings report.

42432369,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNC9bh,1595337576,Figure's Mike Cagney: How to Build a Business in Blockchain,"Mike Cagney is the co-founder and CEO of Figure, a full-stack financial services blockchain company with consumer offerings in market or on the way in lending, banking and more. In late 2019, Figure raised $103 million at a $1.2 billion valuation and continues to grow. Its Provenance blockchain promises radical efficiencies in the $400 billion annual loan origination and trading process.      Prior to starting Figure, Mike co-founded and ran SoFi, which raised over $2.5 billion and has become one of the most successful consumer fintech companies of the decade. If you want to understand how someone creates billions of dollars of value in fintech, there is nobody better to ask.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Future of Finance newsletter.    I sat down with Mike and Will Beeson of Rebank, an advisory firm, to discuss Figure’s routes to asset origination and capital markets disruption, Figure’s previously unannounced consumer banking and payments offering, lessons learned building and scaling multiple billion-dollar companies, and more.      Here are my top takeaways from the talk, edited for clarity (longer version here):      1) To build a blockchain business, build a business. For Figure, this meant focusing on the HELOC (home equity line of credit) asset class and creating the software and markets infrastructure around it.      “The pushback we got two years ago was ‘this was too much too soon, the market wasn't ready for blockchain.’ Like, we could do proof of concepts, we can take baby steps. We didn't want to do that,” Cagney said.      See also: Figure Technologies Securitizes $150M of Home Equity Loans on Blockchain      “So, we ended up creating our lending business first and foremost as a way to create a forcing function for the blockchain. We decided that we were going to originate HELOCs, which was an interesting asset class in its own right and a green field opportunity [given] where the market was.”    We ended up creating our lending business first and foremost as a way to create a forcing function for the blockchain.    “The lending business had to be self-sufficient. It couldn't be a loss leader to drive blockchain adoption. But we used that as a forcing function to get the buy side to engage and say, ‘Hey, yes, we'll buy these assets. Well, you've got to buy them on blockchain’ and then explain what that was. And then we went to the sell side and said, ‘Your clients are buying these assets, they need financing, but you've got to do it on blockchain' and explain what that was.""      “That's effectively how we launched the Provenance blockchain. It wasn't that we started the company and said, ‘boy, we'd really like to be in the HELOC space.’ It was actually an artifact of [being] a first mover, because the market wasn't going to move first on this.”      2) Blockchain provides tangible cost savings for institutional finance above and beyond digitization. Mike suggests a 90 basis points of savings between originations, financing, and securitization. In a world of negative interest rates, that is a lot of savings.      “If you look at Figure, what it costs us to originate a HELOC, it's in the hundreds of dollars, whereas for a traditional bank it's in the thousands of dollars. That has nothing to do with blockchain. That just has to do with how we deal with digital notary, how we deal with digital title search, how we do automated income verification versus having a staff of people that historically have done that work,” Cagney said.      “There's a digitization process that introduces a pretty significant savings and drives a very high contribution margin for the product.      “And then the ability to securitize that asset where I no longer need the indenture trustee or the paying agent or the custody bank I've historically needed, because of lack of trust, or lack of truth, I should say... there's economic benefit to that. And so what we ended up demonstrating was actually 120 basis points of value from point of onboarding through point of sale.”      See also: Lex Sokolin - Software Ate the World, Here’s How It Eats Finance      “So, 33% higher than the original 90 that we thought. That's all blockchain. In addition, we generate significant savings at the origination side just by re-architecting the loan origination system.”      3) SoFi has a cash account offering, which was onerous to build. Figure is targeting the payments business, and sees a partnership with retailers as the right strategy to deploy for growth. Several billions of dollars are paid in interchange fees each year, and the first company to disrupt the card networks successfully will see a massive outcome, Cagney believes.      “When we built SoFi Money, we had a bank that was effectively an omnibus bank so it integrated into the Fed settlement system, it provided a [bank identification number], it held the cash. We faced the customers directly, did all the [know your customer/anti-money laundering], etc. And the bank didn't know the customer. [With Figure] we have these omnibus banks that do the same thing. So why couldn't we get them to give us a [Bank Identification Number]? And then let's build a blockchain ledger for individuals and build the same off ramps into ATM and checks and wires”.      “But the key is that if any two entities within that platform transacted, they could go through a blockchain rail, which is just a ledger of stablecoin from my account to your account versus an interchange rail. And the premise is this works business-to-business, consumer-to-consumer, consumer-to-business. So from a business standpoint, you have this incentive that 'hey, I'm not paying interchange fees.' It's a real time transaction. There's no chargebacks.”      “[For a company like Walmart] every dollar is just a straight bottom line to the profit that they don't pay on interchange. But also we can do direct to consumer as well. It's a really cool structure because it runs very economically and allows us to deliver a sustainable solution in underbanked and unbanked consumers. One of the things we're talking to merchants about is using the geolocation and Bluetooth aspect of this to allow them to pay their employees same day. So it hits your time clock when you walk into the store, it pays you when you leave.”      4) Figure’s Provenance blockchain token HASH is traded privately through a Telegram group, and has a market cap of about $2 billion. This is not listed on any exchanges, which means the company is not exposed to as much speculation, and could see meaningful upside.      There is a native crypto asset, Mike told us.      “Hash, our token right now is not portable. And so it lives exclusively within the Provenance blockchain. We've had requests to tether hash to an exchange to allow people to trade it. So it does trade. It trades in a private Telegram group. And there's a daily auction of Hash that happens within Provenance. So there's a regular transacted and liquid price for it.”      “But the intent is that it should be portable. [But] once that portability is put in place, it introduces a massive incremental set of regulatory issues that we have to navigate. [Some people like Ripple's] Chris Larsen believe there'll be hundreds of blockchains and everything's around interoperability. And Blythe Masters has that view as well. Blythe's one of our advisors and helped us a lot on the architecture of what we were doing to make it scalable and secure for the financial ecosystem.      ""I had the opposite view, which is, you have one blockchain why do you need any other one's because you can basically use smart contracts to build whatever it is you need on that blockchain. And there's massive economies of scale with a single ledger and a single registry.""      5) Cross-selling is required in fintech and in traditional financial services to build a business – a monoline company will not succeed against powerful incumbents. Mike also shares his philosophy on building new companies, which revolves around targeting big markets and avoiding direct competition.      Reflecting on SoFi and the bundling in fintech today, Mike suggests:      “My general view is it is extremely difficult to exist and be successful in a financial services business as a monoline provider. So whether you're doing unsecured consumer, auto, whatever the case might be, you can build niche opportunity sets there. But you really can't build business to scale. You really need a lifetime value construct and a path [to] maximizing wallet share.”    I'm a huge proponent of work from anywhere. Again, that's another thing I've shifted my view on. I used to think that people did that when they didn't really want to work.    ""I'll give you a good example. SoFi does a phenomenal job cross-selling a product and my experience is that the majority of their mortgage product is cross sold to existing relationships. And again that's a huge, huge competitive advantage when you look at what the cost is to get a mortgage to the door.""      6) Finally, Cagney had thoughts about COVID-19 and Figure’s work culture going forward. He said he’d been pleasantly impressed with his team’s productivity and purpose in the last few months. But this is a new road to travel for all of us.      ""We've adopted permanent work from anywhere. We have offices, but no one has to go into the offices.. I worry a little bit about how we are going to maintain that focus and consistency and adhesion into culture, when we don't have the physical proximity anymore. And I don't know the answer to that one yet.""      ""I'm a huge proponent of work from anywhere. Again, that's another thing I've shifted my view on. I used to think that people did that when they didn't really want to work.""      ""Now I've found myself more productive, I've found our team more productive. And I'm a huge proponent of it. But I worry about the cultural aspect of how do you build that sense of belonging and adhesion to a common direction, common goal and common set of values if you're all remote, and it's not that I don't think we can do it, I just don't necessarily know what the playbook is, nor does anyone else, because it really hasn't been done before.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Lex Sokolin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/21/figures-mike-cagney-how-to-build-a-business-in-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6ee0b332fd0dc19df9210a4e9b2461a60ae5a16-1256x976.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432372,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNC9hh,1595333286,First Mover: Bitcoin Shows Signs of Life but Ether (and Crew) Steal the Limelight,"In the race to become the dominant cryptocurrency platform, Ethereum is gaining on Bitcoin.      Take a look at the market capitalization of ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, the value stands at about $26 billion. But that figure doesn't include all of the digital assets built atop the Ethereum blockchain, including some of this year's hottest tokens: stablecoins like tether and USDC and altcoins like Crypto.com's CRO, Chainlink's LINK, Compound's COMP and Kyber's KNC.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The combined value of those ERC-20-standard tokens is also around $26 billion, according to the data provider Messari. That puts the market capitalization of the Ethereum ecosystem at more than $50 billion – closer to bitcoin's $170 billion than if ether were considered alone.      The comparison shows how the rapid pace of development this year on Ethereum has brought the blockchain's ecosystem closer to challenging Bitcoin. The value gap narrowed over the past month as bitcoin's price stagnated, while demand for stablecoins and a flurry of activity in ""decentralized finance,"" known as DeFi, has ignited the value of Ethereum and the tokens that depend on it.      ""DeFi tokens continue their bull run,"" cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock wrote Monday in a weekly commentary.      Messari, a digital-asset data firm, said in a report that the Ethereum blockchain's daily settlement value recently surged to about $2.5 billion, surpassing Bitcoin's for the first time since at least early 2019.      ""Ethereum has blown past Bitcoin,"" Ryan Watkins, a Messari analyst, wrote in the post on Monday. ""With the increasing amount of economic activity taking place on Ethereum, this trend is unlikely to reverse anytime soon, if ever.""      It's the latest chapter in the competition among projects to attain critical mass in the cryptocurrency industry. For entrepreneurs and investors in the space, the goal is to establish networks and projects with enough name recognition, credibility and functionality to scale quickly if and when mass adoption comes.  Bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, attracted most of the hype early in 2020 as some analysts predicted a once-every-four-years event known as the blockchain's ""halving"" could send prices to $90,000. Bitcoin got another bluster of endorsements as the spreading coronavirus slammed the global economy, sending traditional markets plunging and prompting the Federal Reserve and other big central banks to create trillions of dollars of fresh money.      Many investors predicted that the money injections would debase the dollar's purchasing power, driving up the price of bitcoin. Yet over the past couple months, bitcoin's price has stagnated below $10,000, and even its notorious volatility has withered – prompting fickle crypto traders to seek faster-moving action.      Bitcoin has been stuck in a tight trading range for weeks, boring for a market that used to be known for its thrills. However, there are signs Tuesday that an expected big move may be building.      Still, Ether's price is up 81% in 2020 to $237, almost three times bitcoin's 30% year-to-date gain.      Steve Ehrlich, CEO of publicly traded cryptocurrency brokerage firm Voyager Digital, says bitcoin has accounted for about 15% of trading volumes so far in July, down from about 60% prior to the May halving.      ""We've seen a tremendous change in our retail customer behaviors,"" Ehrlich said Monday in a phone interview. ""When bitcoin is extremely flat in the marketplace, people are looking at other tokens.""      In terms of name recognition and popularity outside of the crypto industry, Bitcoin still dominates. According to a report last week from the trading platform eToro and data provider The TIE, only four stories about DeFi appeared in June in ""non-crypto news sources,"" versus some 200 about bitcoin.      ""There is a growing realization though that the 2020 DeFi hype may be overdone,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Monday in an e-mail to subscribers.      Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based cryptocurrency prime broker Bequant, said that ethereum risks becoming a victim of its own success, activity in the tokens built atop the blockchain are driving up transaction fees.      ""This resurgence in the network performance has come with a raft of undesired consequences,"" Vinokourov wrote in emailed remarks.      And Jimmy Song, a well-known bitcoin developer and promoter, told the website CoinMarketCap in an interview published last week that he thinks many DeFi projects will fail to live up to their ""decentralized"" billing because ""they almost always have to have some sort of back door in case something goes wrong.""      ""It's really just a form of gambling with limited upside for people that aren't in control of the protocol,"" Song said.      For now, though, the Ethereum ecosystem is edging closer.      Jack Tan, of Taiwan-based quantitative firm Kronos Research, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey that he sees ether hitting $500 by the end of this year. That would more than double ether's market capitalization, to say nothing of any potential increases in the value of ERC-20 tokens.      ""Ethereum the platform has done its job,"" the cryptocurrency investment firm Arca wrote Monday in a weekly blog post.      Traders are apparently doing their jobs too – following the action.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,347 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,363 | 24-Hr Low: $9,152      Trend: Bitcoin is showing signs of life on Tuesday with prices trading above $9,340 at press time, representing a 1.9% gain on the day. Notably, the cryptocurrency hasn't witnessed an over 1% move since July 9.      The four-hour chart shows the cryptocurrency has broken higher from the four-week-long narrowing price range. The breakout is backed by an above-50 or bullish reading on the relative strength index. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram is printing higher bars above the zero line, a sign the upward move may gather pace.      The immediate resistance at $9,480 – a lower high created on July 9 – could be put to test over the next few hours.      Acceptance above that level would confirm a Bollinger band (volatility indicator) breakout on the daily chart and may yield a rally to $10,000.      The bias would turn bearish if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance under $9,000.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped from $9,190 to $9,360 during the 60 minutes to 08:00 UTC.  Bitcoin is trading at $9,348 at press time – up around 2% on the day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  European Union leaders clinched the long-awaited €750 billion post-pandemic fiscal stimulus plan during the Asian trading hours, boosting demand for equities and sending EUR/USD to a 4.5-month high of 1.1470.  Additional bullish pressure looks to be stemming from hopes that coronavirus vaccines would be ready by the year-end.  Some major European equity indices are up at least 1.5% each, while Germany’s DAX index is currently at its highest level since February.  Asian stocks also gained over 2% early Tuesday; futures tied to the S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark index, are currently up nearly 0.8%.  Looking forward  Bitcoin has recently developed a strong positive correlation with the stock markets.  Equities remain vulnerable to a potential escalation in lingering Sino-U.S. tensions.  Wayne Chen, CEO of Interlapse Technologies, however, said investors may now look to bitcoin as a store of value/safe haven, given the high price of gold.  The precious metal is now just 4.6% short of the record high of $1,911 reached in September 2011.  From a technical analysis standpoint, bitcoin’s immediate bias remains neutral, despite today's rise.  The cryptocurrency is still trapped within the narrowing Bollinger volatility bands.  A Bollinger breakout in either direction would bring a measured move of $400 to support at $8,600 or resistance at $9,800, as noted by Adrian Zdunczyk, CEO of trading community The BIRB Nest in a blog post.

Announced Tuesday, the two companies will provide a package of their respective solutions to firms such as exchanges or virtual asset service providers (VASPs) under FATF parlance.  The tools include CoolBitX's Sygna Bridge product, an API-based messaging service enabling crypto firms to privately share data as required under FATF guidance for the world's regulators, issued last June.  Also included are Elliptic’s on-chain analytic tools designed to help companies comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) requirements from FATF.  The Travel Rule requires VASPs to record identifying data on senders and receivers of transactions worth over $1,000 and pass the information on to other VASPs.  CoolBitX CEO Michael Ou said the blockchain and crypto industries were at a “major crossroads,” with the Travel Rule posing a ""daunting"" challenge for companies.  The partners' products would help firms avoid the risk of stepping outside FATF's AML and CFT rules, Ou said.

42432367,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNC9Xh,1595323996,Samsung Adds Support for Blockchain VR Platform Decentraland,"Global tech giant Samsung is adding support for blockchain-based virtual world Decentraland to its wallet app.    The Ethereum-powered platform allows users to monetize and build a virtual world using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or crypto collectibles.  According to a Decentraland announcement on Monday, the platform’s native tokens, LAND and MANA, are now supported by the Samsung Blockchain Wallet App.  Non-fungible LAND tokens represent parcels of virtual real estate, according to the marketplace’s website, making it easy to trade land parcels with other Decentraland inhabitants.  Fungible MANA tokens, based on the ERC-20 standard, are used to make in-game purchases and are burned (destroyed) in order to buy LAND.  A 3D virtual world in the vein of Second Life, Decentraland differs in that it is owned by its users, co-founder Esteban Ordano previously told CoinDesk.  Samsung unveiled a cryptocurrency wallet in early March 2019 for its flagship phone at the time, the Galaxy S10.  The tech giant has expanded support for cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects across its more budget-friendly-phones, where it has also continued adding dapps in its Blockchain Keystore.  CoinDesk reached out to Samsung for more information but did not receive a reply by press time.

First reported by CoinDesk and later confirmed by Coinbase’s chief compliance officer, Jeff Horowitz, at the Global Digital Finance event on July 15, the project aims to help the crypto industry with the compliance burden of the FATF’s guidelines on anti-money laundering.  BitGo and Coinbase are members of the working group.  The white paper will set out a framework designed to increase exchange transparency and setting out how they could share data over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network and a type of “bulletin board,” Horowitz said at the event, as reported by The Block on Monday.  Participants would share addresses on the board and, if another member claims an address, the two entities could then share data P2P to keep personal information out of the reach of hackers.  The Travel Rule, part of FATF's guidance issued to global regulators on “virtual asset service providers” (VASPs) in June 2019, requires crypto businesses to collect identifying data on both a transaction's sender and receiver, and pass that information on with transactions.  The rule is designed to limit terrorist activity and money laundering by forcing the identities of individuals on amounts over $1,000 to “travel” with the transaction between the sender and receiver.  The Gemini, Kraken and Bittrex exchanges are said by The Block to also be participating in the Travel Rule working group.  Elsewhere, a new messaging standard was introduced to help cryptocurrency firms comply with FATF's guidance in May, creating a uniform model for the data that must be exchanged between VASPs.  In June, FATF reviewed the Travel Rule in a plenary meeting and released a report that examined the progress countries and the private sector had made in implementing its guidance on digital assets.
