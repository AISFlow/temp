42381279,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94VOR,1538220545,New Ripple-Led Advocacy Group to Pay DC Lobbyists in XRP,"Ripple is leading a number of organizations launching a lobbying group in Washington D.C., Business Standard reported Friday.  Dubbed Securing America's Internet of Value Coalition (SAIV), the group includes, apart from Ripple, the RippleWorks Foundation; Coil, a company developing a solution for digital payments; Hard Yaka, an investment firm focusing on digital assets; and PolySign, a company seeking to be a crypto custodian.  Most of the participants have links to Ripple; for example, Coil was founded by the former CTO at Ripple Stefan Thomas and Hard Yaka has been working on a prepaid card allowing users to spend Ripple balances in real time.  Together the startups hope to influence the regulation of crypto in an environment when ""policymakers in Congress and government agencies examine this new technology and wrestle with a regulatory regime that must be updated to meet the needs of this global financial transition,"" the SAIV's press release says.  SAIV will aim to promote ""a vision of a fair and equitable Internet of Value,"" standard and consistent rules for all major protocols, clarification of custodian rules and ""fair and equitable IRS regulations for capital gains, assets and charitable contributions.""  To that end, the coalition has hired lobbying firm Klein/Johnson Group, a bipartisan lobby shop focusing on issues related to technology and financial services and boasting Oracle as one of its clients. Klein/Johnson was founded by former staffers of senators John Cornyn and Chuck Schumer.  Notably, the firm is going to be paid $25,000 a month, as well as 10,000 XRP – the Ripple-linked open-source crypto token worth $0.54 at press time.  Paying lobbyists in tokens gives a certain advantage, said Chris Larsen, executive chairman of Ripple, continuing:  ""It gives them some upside and gives them some risk. Hopefully it gives them a taste of the industry in a way that hits home.""  He admitted that lobbying for crypto-related issues isn't easy currently, but ""there is a lot of interest in this topic in D.C.""  PolySign CEO Jack McDonald said in a statement that digital assets will ""only reach their full potential/adoption when we achieve widespread education and understanding as well as institutional-grade infrastructure in the industry.""  SAIV will focus its efforts on working with US policy makers and government agencies ""who can help us realize these initiatives,"" he explained.  As co-founder of Klein/Johnson Izzy Klein told Business Standard, the new coalition is planning to lobby Congress as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies that are involved in the regulation of crypto.  He also noted that his firm will convert the XRP price into dollars when it discloses the payments on federal lobbying forms.

Partner and founder Michael Arrington tweeted Friday morning that the company had ""received a second subpoena"" from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) due to the firm's role as an investor in a company based in the United States.  He added:  ""The legal costs of dealing with these are not insignificant. We will not invest in any further U.S. deals until the SEC clarifies token rules. Pivot to Asia.""  In a follow-up tweet he also noted that Lichtenstein is a country he may look toward.  Arrington did not clarify which company is being investigated by the SEC, or what information the firm was told to provide. It was also not clear what the costs were for responding to the subpoena.  However, Arrington joins an increasingly large group of members in the crypto community looking for greater clarity from the SEC on how it classifies token sales as securities or non-securities.  A group of 15 congressmen wrote a letter to the agency's chair, Jay Clayton, Friday asking him to more clearly define how the regulator is approaching token sales.  Stopping short of providing a deadline for the SEC, it did list a series of questions that lawmakers hope to see answered on when token sales qualify as securities offerings and whether this classification can change over time.  Arrington declined to comment on the matter when reached.  Editor's note: The headline to this article has been updated.

42381272,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94VFd,1538214311,One Musician's Creative Solution to Drive ASICs Off Monero,"Algorithms are creative.  At least, that's according to Howard Chu, a monero core developer who has dedicated his time to protecting the cryptocurrency from specialized mining hardware, called ASICs. Recently, Chu found a solution to permanently keep ASICs off the network – a proof-of-work algorithm he calls RandomJS, which exploits the fact that the hardware cannot so ""multiple things at once.""  What's perhaps most interesting about his algorithm, though, is that he might have only stumbled on the innovation because of his hobby of traditional Irish fiddle playing. From his hometown in Donegal, one of the most rural and musically rich corners of Ireland, Chu told CoinDesk the algorithm was created with the same imagination he draws on for his musical practice.  According to him, music and code are deeply connected at a neurological level, requiring both the logical and creative sides of the brain to function simultaneously. As a result, Chu said there's a frequent overlap between programming and musical talent – one that he tapped into for the algorithm.  ""Music is very mathematical, the basis of music is mathematical, but at the same time, there's a creativity to it,"" he told CoinDesk.  And with that, Chu created an algorithm that utilizes randomly generated code.  Because ASICs can only be designed to work toward one algorithm, using randomly generated code would make ASICs quickly incompatible, and as such, unprofitable. In this way, many developers think ASIC manufacturers would just steer clear of developing hardware for cryptocurrency projects that switch their algorithm frequently.  Driving this interest in ASIC-blocking code is mining giant Bitmain's inroads into cryptocurrency communities outside bitcoin over the past year. More specifically for Chu, Bitmain released the Antminer X3 ASIC in March that was programmed to run monero's underlying proof-of-work algorithm, cryptonight.  Shortly after monero developers sparked what has become known as crypto's ""war on miners,"" by enacting an emergency software upgrade in April to change the cryptocurrency's algorithm so that the Antminer X3 would be useless on the protocol.  Monero developers have since committed to regular software changes to remove any reemergent hardware.  But because of the risk that the small software changes monero has committed to may be insufficient to dissuade hardware manufacturers long term, Chu built RandomJS as a more sustainable solution for the cryptocurrency.  Speaking about the algorithm, Chu said:  ""RandomJS is coming at the problem from a direction that nobody else is.""  Random math  A widely respected coder, Chu is senior architect of the OpenLDAP project, which created an open-source database layer that underlies much of the telecommunications industry.  And he's been working on monero since 2015.  According to Chu, RandomJS is tied to his musical practice by virtue of its novel approach.  While ASIC hardware manufacturers analyze software and build optimized hardware to run for a particular algorithm, RandomJS takes the opposite approach, analyzing the functions of CPU hardware – the kind that underlies most consumer laptops – and building outward from there.  Chu described the challenge as striking a balance between two functions of a proof-of-work protocol – the time it takes to compute an algorithm and the speed of which it is verified.  For example, while SHA 256 (the proof-of-work algorithm that underlies bitcoin) is simple to verify, according to Chu, it's fundamentally ""too easy"" to compute, meaning that it's trivial to build hardware around it.  ""The cryptographic hash is really great for proving something is authentic, but it's horrible as a unit of work because it's too easy,"" Chu told CoinDesk. ""It's really simple to embed SHA 256 into a chip and clone thousands of these compute units.""  As such, RandomJS makes the compute process more complex, seeking to use CPU functionality in a more holistic way, by using blockchain data as the inputs to generate random code.  ""We take an input, which is the previous block hash, and we use that as a seed for a pseudo-random number generator,"" Chu explained.  This data then generates randomized algorithms written in javascript, which when run by the participating computers, are then hashed and added to the blockchain.  Still, the algorithm itself is being evaluated by the monero core team, and according to Chu, there's a number of things that might delay its adoption. For one, it cannot currently function on the general purpose, or GPU, hardware that comprises the majority of monero's mining infrastructure.  So there's still quite a bit of work to be done.  A musical mind  With that said, Chu's algorithm is perhaps one of the most unique, if not artistic, techniques for blocking ASICs.  Some might even say, with it's always changing code, it's a high-energy approach – one that fits why Chu, originally from Los Angeles, came to northwest Donegal in the first place.  He was led to the rugged coastline because of his passion for Irish traditional music.  But also in Donegal, he found the landscape reflected in the local music.  ""Donegal fiddle style is fairly high energy, sharp and punctuated, and the first time I stood on Malin Head and looked at the coast and the waves crashing on the rocks, I was like, ah, this is that energy,"" Chu told CoinDesk.  As such, Chu plans to set up a programming school in Donegal, where there's also music instruction as part of the curriculum.  ""That'll give flexibility and training and a different way of thinking about things,"" he said.  According to the developer, computer science education often trains students to think logically, which doesn't prepare them for the real world that requires developers to creatively tackle new problems.  Speaking to his interest in melding music and programming, Chu concluded:  ""You can't do that without creativity, and if you haven't been trained to use the creative part of your mind then you are going to struggle with that.""
