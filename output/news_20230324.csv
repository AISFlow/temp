But gains were capped by ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the industry. Recent regional bank failures and concerns over the stability of established lenders have dented trust in the traditional banking system. ""We believe, as the banking crisis in the U.S. deepens, bitcoin is more likely to behave as a risk-off asset,"" said Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. ""Correlations (with equities) have flipped for risk-off assets in the last few days, and it could be a critical signal for investors to monitor."" Meanwhile, the Fed hiked its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points, as expected, and ruled out rate cuts this year. However, some investors appear to be hopeful of a quarter-point rate cut in June, according to fed funds futures. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rose to an over nine-month high of $28.8K the day the Fed announced its decision. It traded within the $26.6K-$28.8K range this week. The total crypto market cap currently stands at $1.15T, down 2.8% over Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap . Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was briefly hit on Friday by Binance, the biggest crypto exchange by trading volume, temporarily suspending spot trading due to a bug. Crackdown Continues U.S. regulators are continuing to clamp down on crypto companies, the latest being Coinbase Global ( COIN ), which was warned of potential charge s by the SEC. A day after, the SEC issued an investor alert warning that the risk of loss for crypto investors ""remains significant"" . It also voiced concerns about crypto exchanges that may not be complying with federal securities laws. The SEC also charged Tron founder Justin Sun and three of his firms for fraud and other securities law violations. Eight celebrities, including actress Lindsay Lohan, were charged for illegal touting of Tronix ( TRX-USD ) and BitTorrent ( BTT-USD ). Meanwhile, a person suspected of being fugitive Do Kwon, cofounder of Terraform Labs, was arrested by police in Montenegro. Terraform was behind collapsed crypto Luna ( LUNA-USD ) and sister token TerraUSD ( UST-USD ). U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) proposed legislation to stop the Fed from creating a central bank digital currency, to ensure that ""big government doesn't attempt to centralize"" crypto. His views echo Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who proposed a law that would prohibit the use of the CBDC. In other news, investors are awaiting a landmark court ruling on the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple Labs, which would determine whether XRP ( XRP-USD ) is a security or not. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) fell 3.1% to $27.42K at 6.45 pm ET and ether ( ETH-USD ) slid 3.6% to $1.75K.

42393749,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA1Pl,1679697931,Crypto Pundits Romance the Hyperinflation and Dollar Death Narrative. Is It a Real Scare?,"Narratives among crypto bulls are ephemeral except one: Bitcoin (BTC) is an antidote to unconventional Federal Reserve monetary policies.  It has recently reached a fever pitch on Crypto Twitter, thanks to venture capitalist and angel investor Balaji Srinivasan saying he'd wager that bitcoin will hit the $1 million mark within 90 days. The former Coinbase chief technology officer also predicted a U.S. banking crisis ​​that would crash the dollar and spur hyperinflation – an excessively fast rise in the price of goods and services. The U.S. dollar, the de facto global reserve currency, has yet to suffer through this type of extreme devaluation.  Balaji's prediction follows the Fed opening liquidity taps in the form of dollar lending programs to contain the banking sector instability in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB) collapse. Similar forecasts predicting Weimar Republic-style U.S. hyperinflation made plenty of noise following the covid-spurred crash of March 2020 and the 2008 global meltdown. On both occasions, the Fed poured trillions of dollars into the system through outright asset purchases, or quantitative easing (QE).  Hyperinflation almost always results from a large amount of money ""chasing"" the same amount of goods and services being supplied in an economy. In other words, the money created through QE or other measures must be spent on the stagnant stock of goods and services to boost inflation. Assets like stocks or cryptocurrencies can hyperinflate in terms of valuations if the newly created money enters financial markets instead of the real economy (as it did following the 2008 and 2020 crashes).  The Fed's latest measure – the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) – is not QE, even though it has caused a QE-style expansion of the Fed's balance sheet.  ""There's a lot of confusion and hyperbole out there about the implications of U.S. government measures to stem the banking turmoil. It's not QE [quantitative easing] and while inflation will remain sticky, it won't be hyperinflation,"" Martha Reyes, a member of the advisory council at the Digital Economy Initiative, told CoinDesk.  In QE, the Fed snaps up Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities from financial institutions with no pre-defined holding period. When the Fed purchases bonds from a bank, the latter's cash reserves at the central bank rise, providing it with a liquidity cushion and greater incentive to lend. Increased lending then encourages more spending and investment, putting upward pressure on prices either in the real economy or asset markets.  Under the BTFP, the Fed is loaning money to banks to allow them to meet their immediate financial obligations. Banks need liquidity to service the deposit flight seen after large interest rate hikes by the Fed. A liquidity shortage can lead to widespread bank runs, a catastrophic outcome.  The borrowing banks have to return the money after a year along with the interest rate charged as per overnight index swap (OIS) rate plus 10 basis points. It's not free money like QE!  ""BTFP is not QE. It is a program to help stabilize banking liquidity. This new BTFP program will allow banks to pledge [Treasurys] or mortgages in return for immediate liquidity for up to one year. It is a liquidity program available in times of stress and is short term,” emerging markets trader and analyst Seng Liew said in a LinkedIn post.  ""Conventional vanilla banking is about the mismatch between deposits and assets. In SVB's case, they had deposit redemptions of $42 [billion], which is just over 20% of the bank assets when Silicon Valley deserted them in one day. That caused the failure, not the investment in the assets. Since the [COVID-19] pandemic, corporate loan growth has been mediocre away from the huge increase under the PPP loan program. Hence, most banks invested the bulk of their liquidity in U.S. [Treasurys] and mortgages,"" Liew added.  In other words, the money received from the Fed in the form of loans through BTFP or other programs like the discount window is unlikely to be used in a way that will lead to stimulus in the economy or financial markets.  “QE is increasing the balance sheet for monetary purposes. This is about financial stability, and all expansion of the balance sheet is not QE,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex and author of “Making Sense of the Dollar,"" told CoinDesk in an email.  Dollar death fears overblown  Hyperinflation predicted by Balaji can also materialize through a sharp, sudden devaluation of the greenback. Currency devaluation imports inflation from abroad, raising the general price level in the economy.  History, however, tells us that investors tend to flock into the dollar-denominated assets during times of stress, including those caused by stateside issues.  The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s value against major currencies, surged by 11% in the second half of 2008 even as Lehman Brothers collapsed, causing a worldwide contagion. The index stabilized in the range of 75 to 90 in the subsequent years, even though the Fed did multiple rounds of QE. The dollar slipped 11% in 10 months after the Fed reopened liquidity floodgates in March 2020, a notable devaluation but far from the outright hyperinflationary crash.  “In the event of a widespread banking panic, which seems unlikely at this time, there will probably be the typical rush by investors into safe assets such as the U.S. Treasury securities. That is likely to help than hurt the dollar in the short term,” Eswar Prasad, professor at Cornell University, told CoinDesk, calling the hyperinflation forecasts “unduly hyperbolic.”  “It will be interesting to see if the narrative of crypto being perceived by investors as a safer asset than fiat currency holds up if the current turmoil in the banking system intensifies,” Prasad added.  Banking crisis is deflationary  A full-blown banking crisis, as predicted by Balaji, can actually cause a credit freeze, as observed after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, and lead to deflation – a general decline in prices for goods and services, typically associated with a contraction in the supply of money and credit in the economy. Deflation usually boosts demand for cash.  Banks are more likely to keep the money borrowed from the Fed with them to ensure healthy liquidity levels instead of lending it out.  Credit freeze refers to a situation in which international interbank markets freeze and interbank lending beyond very short maturities virtually evaporates, cutting the supply of liquidity to households and businesses.  ""Loans to illiquid institutions are lifelines, pure triage that cannot escape the banking system and manifest as velocity. They slow the economy as lending at these banks freezes,"" Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO of Quill Intelligence LLC, tweeted.  Pavlovian conditioning?  Despite the obvious differences between QE and BTFP and the deflationary impact of an outright banking sector crisis, many in the market are expecting rapid price gains in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has rallied over 40% in two weeks.  Perhaps the disconnect from obvious reality results from Pavlovian conditioning – the behavioral and physiological changes brought about by experiencing a predictive relationship between a neutral stimulus (ultra-easy monetary policy since 2008) and a consequent biologically significant event (surge in risk assets).  Interest rates were stuck at or below zero for the most part between 2008 and 2021, barring the Fed's minor tightening cycle that saw rates rise by 225 basis points between December 2015 and December 2018. Besides, most central banks, including the Fed, embarked on multiple rounds of quantitative easing.  The prolonged easing bias has permanently paired the neutral stimuli and the consequent event in the minds of investors. As such, every Fed move is either being misread as QE or an advance indicator of an eventual launch of QE.

42414083,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvgdt,1679695745,Amazon's NFT Plans Teased in a Receipt Mailed Friday Afternoon,"On Friday afternoon, Nikhilesh De, CoinDesk's managing editor for global policy and regulation, received an email from an official Amazon account appearing to confirm the existence of digital tokens and a gallery on the e-commerce platform.  The email was sent to De as a confirmation after a Amazon Prime Video channel subscription was renewed automatically. De had not purchased a non-fungible token (NFT) from Amazon and did not have any prior knowledge of the platform's integration of NFTs.  The email provides new insights into Amazon's plans for Web3 expansion and hints at where these new tools might live on the platform.  Rumors have been swirling for weeks that Amazon is planning to release its own NFT marketplace soon, though Amazon has not yet commented publicly on the reports.  Crypto news site Blockworks first touted the idea in January, citing anonymous sources. According to the report, the new ""digital assets enterprise"" would focus on ""blockchain-based gaming and related NFT applications."" Crypto site The Big Whale then followed up with a report earlier this month giving the feature a launch date of April 24. The story, which also cited anonymous sources, said the NFT platform will be available on the site through a tab that says ""Amazon Digital Marketplace.""  In January, Amazon's cloud-computing platform Amazon Web Services announced it will work with Ava Labs to expand its enterprise blockchain offerings, though there was no mention of plans for NFTs or a digital collectibles marketplace.  According to the email sent to De, a digital token was deposited into a gallery hosted on the official Amazon website. However, it appears that the link provided in the email does not yet work.  The email also mentions resale opportunities, noting that the NFT would not be eligible for resale ""until it's unlocked."" The email also said De would need to ""register as a reseller"" before listing the NFT. But the link provided to the resale page also appeared to be broken.  De was not able to access the digital tokens. It's unclear how NFTs are connected to this subscription renewal, though both the email and the transaction confirmation were received around the same time.  A representative for Amazon did not immediately respond to CoinDesk for comment.  Amazon's embrace of NFTs could be a huge step toward mass adoption of Web3 for its millions of global users. Amazon CEO Andy Jassey has expressed an openness to blockchain technology, telling CNBC in April 2022 that he expects that NFTs ""will continue to grow very significantly"" and said crypto integration might be ""possible down the road.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/03/24/amazons-nft-plans-teased-in-a-receipt-mailed-friday-afternoon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9d65dced3c284d81ad28ead6ebafe8c5815598f-612x344.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin and ether prices changed only mildly, with BTC down 0.57% and ETH down 2.52%. Trading activity was orderly, with overall volume trailing the 20-day moving average for both assets.  This week was anything but uneventful, however, with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcing another interest rate hike, the banking industry trying to avert a meltdown and U.S. regulators ratcheting up their scrutiny of the crypto industry.  Even the Biden administration was viewing the crypto industry more sharply this week. Its “Economic Report of the President” led with comments that the design of crypto assets “frequently reflects an ignorance of basic economic principles that have been learned in economics and finance over centuries, and this inadequate design is often detrimental to consumers and investors.”  Still, much of the economic turmoil this week is tied to the bond portfolios of traditional banking institutions. Those bond values have declined sharply following the most rapid increase of interest rates in history.  The Federal Open Market Committee ultimately raised interest rates by 25 basis points as expected, and said that it expects to continue doing so as inflation, the result partly of a two-year long, 0% interest rate environment, remains too high.  FOMC raised its Core PCE inflation estimates for 2023 to 3.3% from 3.1%, but the ultimate interest rate projection of 5.1% remains.  Among crypto assets with market capitalizations of $1 billion or more, BTC and ETH were eighth and 14th, respectively, in this week’s CoinDesk Indices price performance chart.  XRP led the group rising 11.1%, while immutable X (IMX) and its 27.7% decline was the laggard. Looking ahead to next week, key points on the economic calendar include the quarterly GDP data on March 30, and core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data on March 31.

The USDC incident earlier this month was a harrowing moment for the cryptocurrency industry, in which a key asset that investors used to safely – it was thought – park money suddenly proved uncomfortably volatile.

About $1.3 million of that is invested in USDC.

42414082,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvgYa,1679692875,Bitcoin Edges Below $28K as Investors Weigh Deutsche Bank Contagion Fears,"Cryptocurrency prices sank Friday as investors grappled with a new threat to the global banking system as well as continuing concerns about U.S. monetary policy.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently changing hands at about $27,450, down more than 2% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. BTC rose as high as about $28,300 earlier in the day and is up more than 16% in March.  But most risk-on markets were reeling for much of the day after the cost of insuring the debt of financial services giant Deutsche Bank soared to its highest point in four years, raising concerns anew about the strength of the banking sector.  Shares of Deutsche Bank (DB) plunged 14% one point Friday before closing down 3%. Deutsche Bank’s problems come just days after UBS agreed to acquire its troubled rival, Credit Suisse for $3.2 billion, and less than three weeks after the failure of U.S.-based Silvergate, Silicon Valley and Signature banks.  In a newsletter Friday, analysts for bitcoin mining equipment and hosting provider Blockware Solutions said that BTC’s resistance had formed at $28,800, about where it stood during a correction in the summer of 2021.  ""This would be a logical place to see BTC make another leg lower, however a continued consolidation here would be welcomed,"" the analysts wrote. ""This is a fairly pivotal spot for bulls to defend in order to maintain this current bullish structure.""  “A break above this level would obviously be the most ideal scenario for bulls, but if we are going to pull back, we would like to see BTC hold ~$25,200,” they added.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was recently changing hands at $1,745, off 3% from Thursday, same time. Layer 2 blockchain Optimism’s OP token price declined by over 9% to $2.23 from above $2.47 the previous day.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was down roughly 2.7%.  Equity markets edged lower Friday opening before closing in the green as investors recovered from at least some of their banking shock. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and tech-heavy Nasdaq finished up 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.  “Large banks tend to be interconnected, with shared exposures on syndicated loans, and via a web of repo and other counterparty transactions,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at brokerage firm Interactive Brokers, wrote in a note Friday about banking contagion.  “It is logical, though unhelpful, for investors who were burned by one bank to get serious jitters about those that most resemble it,” Sosnick wrote.  He also noted that credit default swaps can be “catastrophic” for bondholders because ""it impairs the income stream on which the holders depend,” adding: “As a result, the market value of the bond can fall substantially and precipitously.”  Meanwhile, crypto investors continued to weigh recent regulatory enforcement issues, including a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warning to Coinbase that the agency is pursuing an enforcement action against the exchange for possible securities violations.  “No one knows how regulators are going to rule if all tokens are securities,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Friday note, adding that Coinbase’s success is “vital for longer-term crypto growth.”  “In the U.S., Coinbase is a critical option for how people are getting started with crypto,” he wrote.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/24/bitcoin-edges-below-28k-as-investors-weigh-deutsche-bank-contagion-fears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4dc0a4a5c8391ec85fafa16bf23498a7067a58f6-5100x3401.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new industry group, unveiled at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Friday, is focused on driving mass adoption of Web3 gaming by leveraging its collective expertise and resources. Members of W3GC include Web3 gaming decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) Game7, decentralized guild network Yield Guild Games and Web3 gaming publisher Fenix Games.  See Also: How to Level Up Your Knowledge of Web3 Gaming  “We’ve seen an emphasis on infrastructure investment for blockchain games, and many teams are doing great work tackling important problems in the technology and services ‘stack’” said Steven Chen, core contributor at Game7. “A focus on bringing in more quality games and [intellectual property] will drive the sector forward, as we saw with PC, console and mobile games.”  Gabby Dizon, co-founder of YGG, said in a statement that discovering and accessing Web3 games remains too complicated for the average user. ""Working with a DAO like Game7 and a game publisher like Fenix Games enables YGG to address the industry's challenges by simplifying the landscape and growing the ecosystem for mass adoption.""  The group also hopes to ""de-risk"" the space for investors and developers and help find and scale a blockchain ""mega-hit"" that will bring in new users.  Magic Eden has expressed a growing interest in Web3 gaming in recent months. In December, the company named former Electronic Arts executive Chris Akhavan as its chief gaming officer, and, in February, Magic Eden Ventures invested in 11 Web3 gaming studios.  The expansion continued earlier this month with ""Mint Madness, an initiative to launch a dozen games on three blockchains through March.

42414064,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvf6N,1679684457,Bitcoin From Defunct BTC-e on the Move Again: Report,"The long-dormant bitcoin stash from the defunct BTC-e crypto exchange has been moving on the blockchain for the past two weeks, an anonymous member of a Russian Telegram channel noticed on Thursday.  The wallet received 3,299 BTC from the known wallet of BTC-e in November 2022, in the first transaction the BTC-e wallet sent since 2017. Back then the wallet sent 10,000 bitcoin ($165 million) to two unidentified recipients. On March 14 one of the receiving wallets started moving funds again, eventually sending small parts to exchanges and over-the counter (OTC) trading desks, presumably to cash out the bitcoin.  Blockchain analytics firm Crystal Blockchain confirmed to Russian-language crypto website Forklog that smaller parts of those 3,299 BTC have been sent to exchanges KuCoin and MEXC, as well as to an OTC desk named BTC2pm.  According to the on-chain data, around 2.75 BTC landed on KuCoin in two transactions via a number of intermediary wallets, and 1 BTC went to MEXC.  CoinDesk requested comments from KuCoin and MEXC but had not heard back by press time.  BTC-e trail  U.S. law enforcement agencies shut down BTC-e in 2017 and arrested its alleged operator, Russian national Alexander Vinnik, at a resort near Thessaloniki, Greece. The U.S. Department of Justice accused him of money laundering and other crimes.  After a stint in a Greek prison, then a trial in France Vinnik was finally extradited to the U.S. in August to face indictment for “computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials and narcotics distribution rings.” He is now at the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin, California, according to the court case docket.  Soon after BTC-e stopped operations, its successor, WEX, appealed to the BTC-e users, offering to resume trading from their accounts and also to get refunds for their lost funds.

42414080,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvgDM,1679679775,Federal Reserve Says Custodia’s Plans Would Endanger Itself and the Crypto Industry,"The Federal Reserve Board hammered more nails into the coffin of Custodia Bank's failed push for membership on Friday, condemning the proposal's shortcomings in every single category the Fed assesses, saying each of those misfires would have justified its own rejection.  Custodia’s membership application, as well as its application for a master account, was denied in January, 18 months after the applications were initially filed. Custodia, formerly known as Avanti Bank, sued the Federal Reserve in June 2022, alleging that the central bank was unlawfully delaying its decision, and filed an amended complaint earlier this year alleging a Fed conspiracy to block it. This epic response from the Fed is the first detailed effort at explanation.  In Friday’s 86-page release, the Fed’s famously measured language was about as harsh as it gets as the central bank detailed ""fundamental concerns"" with Custodia's approach. The banking supervisor noted ""significant deficiencies in Custodia’s ability to manage the risks of its day-one activities,"" and doubted its ability to handle basic safety measures and to comply with banking laws regarding money laundering.  The Fed's response also potentially signaled its deeper thinking about other key crypto banking issues, such as its worries about banks handling stablecoins. It could give the industry more to think about once it moves past the tremors from the recent bank failures.  “The Custodia order is 14 times longer than the next-longest Fed denial order in history, and 41 percent longer than the longest Fed order of any type, which speaks volumes about the messages the Fed intended to send to both banks and crypto companies in this order,” said Nathan Miller, a Custodia spokesperson.  The board’s explanation for the January rejection comes just two weeks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which was shut down on March 10 after a bank run. Shortly after, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took over SVB. The failure of SVB – a $200 billion bank – is the biggest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 collapse of Washington Mutual.  In the wake of SVB’s collapse, state regulators in New York shut down another lender, Signature Bank, claiming that there had been a “crisis of confidence” in the bank’s leadership. Both Signature and SVB were known for being crypto-friendly institutions. Their closures have added fuel to the fire of conspiracy theories that U.S. regulators are making a coordinated effort to cut crypto off from the wider banking system.  Custodia has pushed back on the Fed’s rejection, both through its ongoing lawsuit and in a further statement Friday which called the order “the result of numerous procedural abnormalities, factual inaccuracies that the Fed refused to correct, and general bias against digital assets.”  “Rather than choosing to work with a bank utilizing a low-risk, fully-reserved business model, the Fed instead demonstrated its shortsightedness and inability to adapt to changing markets,” the Custodia statement said. “Perhaps more attention to areas of real risk would have prevented the bank closures that Custodia was created to avoid. It is a shame that Custodia must turn to the courts to vindicate its rights and compel the Fed to comply with the law.”  Outside of the crypto sphere, the global banking system has continued to show increasing signs of instability post-SVB. Credit Suisse, after years of being plagued by controversy, was forced to merge with UBS. And San Francisco-based First Republic Bank required an injection of $70 billion in liquidity from the Federal Reserve and J.P. Morgan to ensure its ability to meet withdrawal requirements.  Rationale for Custodia’s denial  The Fed’s eviscerating explanation for its denial of Custodia cites the crypto bank’s decision not to insure its deposits – instead, the bank proposed to be fully capitalized, holding $1.08 in cash for every dollar deposited by customers – which the FRB said could increase Custodia’s risk of runs and contagion.  The Board argued that Custodia’s revenue model, which “relies almost solely upon the existence of an active and vibrant market for crypto-assets” makes it vulnerable to market volatility, even though the Board admitted that “Custodia appears to have sufficient capital and resources to sustain initial operations.”  The Fed explained that it has several factors it uses to evaluate an application, from managerial ability to financial strengths, and it argued that the results in each were “so adverse as to present sufficient grounds on their own for warranting denial of the application.”  One of the most biting observations from the regulator was in its assessment that Custodia’s business plan may not only be a danger to itself, but also to the crypto customers it’s seeking to serve.  “The current record indicates Custodia could in fact pose significant risk to its community,” the document said.  The membership was denied without prejudice, meaning that Custodia would, in theory, be able to apply again in the future.  Stablecoin concerns  The central bank’s criticism of Custodia seemed to go well beyond its own business. Crypto industry observers will be paying close attention to the Fed’s language on stablecoins – those tokens, generally tied to stable assets such as the dollar, that are the lifeblood of cryptocurrency trading.  In contrast to what federal regulators had once agreed was the safest course for stablecoins – that they be issued by regulated banks or financial firms that are under similar strict rules – the Fed had a lot to say Friday about how dangerous a Custodia-issued stablecoin could be. More in line with statements the U.S. banking regulators had issued at the start of the year, the central bank outlined worries about what would happen with Custodia’s token Avit if the business were granted a Fed master account.  The regulator said that Custodia piling its Avit reserves into the Fed account could give a sense to the market that the token had “a form of implicit backing” from the central bank.  “This could enable such a product to scale quickly and globally; it could plausibly become a tool for persons around the world to access the stability of the U.S. dollar instantly and anonymously,“ the Fed argued. That could create “a new, meaningful, and volatile source of demand for Federal Reserve liabilities.”  The Fed's position suggests “the virtual impossibility – if not actual impossibility – of banks engaging with stablecoins issued on open, public blockchains,“ said Miller, the Custodia spokesperson. “This is terrible policy for the United States, because the rest of the world has figured out solutions to this problem.”  UPDATE (March 24, 2023, 21:06 UTC): Adds details of the Fed's views on the Custodia application.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,"Cheyenne Ligon, Jesse Hamilton",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/24/federal-reserve-says-custodias-crypto-focused-business-model-is-inconsistent-with-approval,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ca43dc0f3ea07d5295a0eec233d6979b2b7ac15-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Thursday, Kwon was arrested at the airport in Montenegro’s capital city of Podgorica, according to a tweet from Filip Adzic, the country’s interior minister. Hours after Kwon's arrest, New York federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against Kwon for fraud. On Friday, Kwon was charged with forgery and is set to appear in court as he faces extradition proceedings.  South Korean authorities issued a warrant for Kwon's arrest on charges of fraud last September, four months after the UST stablecoin and its sister stablecoin LUNA lost most of their value. Kwon is a South Korean national.  On CoinDesk TV, Braganca said the SEC is bringing charges against Kwon and those who worked with him because he allegedly misled investors about how the UST stablecoin was backed.  “LUNA and Terraform [Labs] were not stable as they were supposed to be,” she said. The UST token was intended to maintain a peg to the U.S. dollar, while LUNA, its companion token, was intended to stabilize UST’s price.  “The algorithm that Do Kwon said was in place was supposed to cause them [LUNA/UST] to come back into balance and be stablecoins,” Braganca said.  But instead, Braganca claimed, Kwon “went to a third party to get a big buy to prop it [LUNA/UST] up,” and is alleged to have engaged in market manipulation. She said that “more sophisticated institutional investors” also lost billions of dollars with the collapse of Terra.

A ZK rollup refers to a scaling system for Ethereum that allows transactions to be submitted off the main blockchain (layer 1) and bundled, or “rolled up,” in a smart contract with other transactions. That compressed bundle then settles back on the mainchain with a smaller data proof that can be verified without disclosing the particulars of the transactions within the rollup, preserving the privacy of the transaction.  Aztec Connect was just one of the iterations of the technology Aztec is developing, the company said, and more interesting products are ahead.  In March 2021, Aztec launched its first product – zk.money – a basic software for private transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In July 2022, a sister product, Aztec Connect, was launched. Both products will be shut down simultaneously, Aztec said. As of Friday, Aztec Connect had little over $20 million of total value locked in the protocol, according to DefiLlama.  To support its operations, Aztec raised VC funding over the past two years. In December 2021, Aztec Network raised $17 million in a Series A funding round to fuel the further technical as well as legal work, the team said at the time. A year later, the company received $100 million more in funding.  Three-letter agencies to blame?  Some users suspected the decision was a result of the regulatory pressure, but Aztec refutes that suggestion. In an interview with CoinDesk, Aztec head of product Joe Andrews and CEO Zac Williamson reiterated that they haven’t been approached by any regulators or law enforcement agencies, although, as a registered U.K. company, Aztec is in contact with that country’s regulators.  Last year, Ethereum’s most popular mixer, Tornado Cash, was put on a sanctions list by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for being used by North Korean hackers; soon after, Tornado developer Alexey Pertsev was arrested in the Netherlands. OFAC also sanctioned another mixer, Blender.io, and last week, U.S. and German authorities announced the seizure of servers belonging to ChipMixer.  The crackdown made it clear that the governments of the world, especially, the one in the U.S., do not look favorably on blockchain privacy tools, be they decentralized open-source services like Tornado Cash or its custodial peers.  The Ethereum community had an especially tough experience with regulators over the past several years, especially in the criminal case of Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith, who was sentenced to five years in jail for speaking at a North Korean crypto conference.  Read also: Crypto 2023: It's Sanctions Season  Yet, none of this was a factor in the demise of Aztec Connect, the company said.  “What’s happened over the last six months, it has been concerning,” CEO Williamson said. “I feel [there] is an attempt to establish a precedent that on-chain privacy is somehow dangerous and should not be expected by default by users. But we had not been largely affected by that – we have not been approached by the regulators.”  He added that while the company did discuss the regulatory aspect internally it was the commercial side that tipped the balance in favor of winding the project down.  The entire service ran on a single node, and supporting that node had become prohibitively labor intensive, demanding the attention of half of Aztec’s team of over 40 people. Considering the company is not generating a profit and currently runs on the money raised during the funding rounds, this model wouldn’t be sustainable.  Furthermore, Aztec Connect was not as stable and scalable as the team wanted it to be, and in its current version, as a single node, it was de facto centralized, Williamson said:  “If we wanted to keep it alive we would have to decentralize it, and we were not prepared to sink resources into that.”  A new iteration of Aztec  The company plans to focus on developing Noir, a programming language that would help create zero-knowledge-powered, private Ethereum smart contracts, along with the software required to run a new iteration of Ethereum ZK rollup Aztec 3. In addition to privacy, this software will also allow developers to build compliance tools right into decentralized applications.  “We want to establish a precedent with this technology – that the side of regulation is on the application and not the network level. You can’t do it when you have a centralized node in a centralized network. At this point, the network and the application are the same. So we need a better technology to establish that,” Williamson said.  The plan is to have a small community of developers to build on the new iteration of Aztec software as soon as within the next six months, Andrews, the head of product, said.  However, unlike with Aztec Connect, the company is not planning to run its own node, only to provide software tools for others to build and run nodes of their own. When asked whether they think such an approach would weaken the technology’s adoption, Williamson and Andrews said they don’t believe so.  “I would be very in favor of us running a node,” Williamson said, adding that the team has not yet discussed this issue in depth.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/24/founders-deny-regulatory-pressure-forced-aztec-connect-zkmoney-shutdown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ff9cd0e8741039943a42797648a1d01b297433d-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a statement provided to CoinDesk, Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski said ""there are no plans to launch a token for now.""  ""The team is focused on today's launch and further development of the protocol,"" Gluchowski said. ""A token only comes into play with decentralizing the network, and that is still far on the horizon."" Similar comments were reported earlier by The Block.

The issue with speculating that a token may be involved is that there’s a degree of risk. No one knows if an airdrop will ever come, much less the inherent value of what a token on zkSync would represent; plus, there’s all sorts of bogus offers, and scammers frequently use airdrops to rip people off.  That said, Crypto Twitter traders have started to share their strategies for getting in early on potential zkSync airdrop so that they can rack in the possibility of a profit. Suggested options ranged from placing trades on applications on the network to minting a non-fungible token.  Based on the precedent set by many crypto projects, the speculation isn’t totally unfounded.  Arbitrum, a layer 2 scaling tool for the Ethereum blockchain, which has its own ""optimistic rollup,"" came out with its own long-awaited ARB token and released it to community members earlier this week. Crypto traders rushed to cash in on ARB, and during the initial drop, the token soared as high as $14 before falling to $1.38 once more users claimed their tokens.  More to the point, traders had been using the network for months to rack up transactions – having anticipated correctly that such metrics would eventually be used to determine who got the airdropped tokens.

42421296,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnoFh,1679678026,"Bank Consolidation Threatens Freedom, Makes Case for Bitcoin","The developing world’s case for bitcoin is starting to resonate in the developed world.  I, like many, have long argued it’s easier to explain bitcoin to people who live within dysfunctional financial and political systems than to those from stable, developed economies such as the U.S. Such populations have PTSD from past hyperinflation. Just as importantly, they often have first-hand experience of how banks can act as gatekeepers to their money.  I’ll always remember an image I was greeted with when, in 2003, I relocated to Argentina amid the ongoing banking freeze imposed during its financial crisis: Buenos Aires bank branches encased in impenetrable cages to protect them from enraged customers, their steel walls emblazoned with graffiti against “banqueros ladrones” (thieving bankers). It shouldn’t be a surprise that a decade later, once that banking crisis had run its sad, inevitable course toward profligate fiscal and monetary solutions that fostered perpetual double-digit inflation, Argentina became a hotbed of bitcoin adoption and crypto innovation.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For now, I don’t see U.S. and European banks forced into the same Argentina-style shutdown. But the current banking crisis, which has introduced a new source of uncertainty to developed economies, points to a more subtle but arguably more dangerous threat to freedom that also underscores the importance of bitcoin.  That threat won’t necessarily come from the Federal Reserve or other central banks being compelled to pursue lax monetary policy that becomes inflationary. (Those buying Balaji Srinivasan’s wild bet on $1 million bitcoin price by June 17 are missing the point that, to start with, collapsing banks equals collapsing money creation – i.e., the crisis will have a deflationary effect, not an inflationary one. Only if the Fed were to go full Weimar Republic would that effect be offset by massive money-printing.)  Rather, it relates to the second part of that developing world experience: society’s vulnerability to the centralized control that banks exert over people’s savings and transactions. In overseeing the lifeblood of an economy, banks have unique, corruptible power.  Big gets bigger  The core issue is not that people’s deposits are at risk from there being too little federal insurance or bailout money to go around, though the problem that there’s a natural limit to that important backstop is another argument for bitcoin. It’s the concentration of banking power that fearful depositors are now enabling by pulling their funds out of small regional banks and funneling them into a few behemoths: Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, et al.  We are unwittingly exacerbating the same “too big to fail” problem exposed in the previous crisis of 2008, the idea that a handful of huge financial institutions hold such sway over our financial system that they can effectively hold the government hostage, taking on risk in the knowledge that the taxpayer will always bail them out. Over time, this system has entrenched an unholy relationship between Wall Street and Washington, D.C., one that’s inseparable from the gobs of money that financial institutions donate to politicians and from the revolving-door jobs that former regulators routinely get at those institutions.  What’s bothering me about this right now, however, is not the systemic risks but the wider problem that a state-sponsored banking oligarchy takes shape. These institutions are amassing collective censorship power over transactions, positioning themselves as illiberal gatekeepers of human behavior. This risk is intensified by the special SIFI (systemically important financial institution) status that the biggest banks were assigned in the regulatory response to the 2008 crisis.  The SIFIs are “not really, in the traditional sense, private enterprises,” said Galaxy Digital’s head of research, Alex Thorn, on this week’s episode of our “Money Reimagined” podcast. “They work with a specific government charter, with specific government obligations and protections … [The government] can tell the banks what they can and can't hold and what they can and can't do. I think that centralization is really acute at that big level, and the solutions put forth to these types of crises really just push it further in that direction.”  There are very clear signs, if not hardline proof, that governments and banks are coordinating a crackdown on crypto firms. There are accounts everywhere that startups in the crypto industry that had previously banked with failed entities Silvergate, Signature or Silicon Valley Bank are getting rejections as they try to open new bank accounts. And although the New York Department of Financial Services swears that its closure of a seemingly solvent Signature Bank two weekends ago was not motivated by the bank’s exposure to crypto clients, Reuters reported that the FDIC, which took it over, has been demanding that any future buyer will have to relinquish the bank’s crypto business. The FDIC later denied that assertion.  Observers are calling this “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” an allusion to an unofficial Obama era policy in which banks were pressured to restrict access to the financial system for businesses such as gun sellers and pornographers. Regardless of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s spate of recent lawsuits against industry leaders and regardless of what some people in the wider population think of “crypto bros,” there is nothing inherently illegal about being a digital asset service provider. As with the Obama-era dragnet, this “shadow banning” of legal but politically unfavored activity is rightfully seen as a breach of those entity’s rights, which is probably why governments never formally admit that such policies exist.  The thing about public-sector agencies getting these private-sector entities to do their dirty work is that it allows the government agency plausible deniability, which makes it difficult for victims of discriminatory enforcement actions to plead their case before a judge. The Fed’s bank supervisors provide “guidelines” to bank compliance officers, not explicit instructions. It’s a deliberately ambiguous extra-legal strategy, one that you will find rife among authoritarian regimes.  Access to money is vital for freedom  To be clear, I’m not saying the U.S. has become authoritarian, but that the evolution of these relationships is a pathway toward it. We need to have our eyes wide open to it.  What’s at issue is much more than whether crypto firms can write and deposit checks. It’s that as banking becomes concentrated among a few huge, tightly regulated institutions, a very real threat to human freedom arises. Without the capacity to transact, people can be blocked from engaging in many otherwise legal activities that are unpalatable to the powers that be.  This is why bitcoin censorship-resistant money matters. It offers an alternative to dependence on that banking system. Just as it has provided a lifeline to young women in Afghanistan whose gender prevented them from opening bank accounts, to Ukrainian refugees and activists in Nigeria, it now offers an opt-out financial option for people in the U.S. and elsewhere.  For bitcoin to be important it doesn't need a massive number of people to use it. What matters is its mere existence as an alternative. The fact that the option is there for people if and when they need it makes it harder for bankers and governments to constrain freedom.  Two decades ago, Argentines didn’t have a way out of the banks’ trap. Now, people do. That is a game-changing situation.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Michael J.

42421295,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnoEf,1679675667,A Sudden Onset of Hyperinflation: What Will Happen to Bitcoin?,"I said I wouldn't write about it. I promised. I swore.  I even tweeted.  And I lied.  Last weekend, Twitter was ablaze with reactions to former Coinbase Chief Technology Officer Balaji Srinivasan accepting a bet proposed by James Medlock that due to hyperinflation in the United States a single bitcoin would be worth $1 million in just 90 days (by June 15, 2023).  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The bet loosely works like this: In 90 days, Srinivasan will send Medlock $1 million U.S. dollars and Medlock will send Srinivasan 1 BTC.  It feels like a marketing ploy. It is a marketing ploy. Srinivasan himself has admitted that this is an ideological bet and not a “money-making bet.” Instead this marks a moment to ring the alarm about the horrors of money printing and impending hyperinflation.  See also: You Can Be a Bitcoin Maximalist and Like Ethereum, Too | Opinion  Before all this, he raised the “BitSignal,” a promise to pay $1,000 in BTC to people with the best tweets about the state of American decay. Last weekend, Srinivasan and the Twitter faithful raised the alarm: Financial ruin is nigh.  And then U.S. financial markets opened flat on Monday morning. Balaji’s peers, venture capitalists such as Jason Calacanis, have had mixed reactions. Calacanis called the bet “brilliant” because the increased attention would likely drive up bitcoin’s price, but cautioned Balaji about starting a bank run.  In any event, I'll go on record: Bitcoin won't be worth $1 million on June 15, 2023, because of hyperinflation in the United States. This is not financial advice. But instead of focusing on the bet itself, I’d rather focus on what a hyperinflated, $1 million bitcoin would even look like.  First and foremost, hyperinflation in the United States would be catastrophic for the global economy. Full stop. The fallout would be genuinely unfathomable. The U.S. is the beacon of stability for the rest of the world. Hyperinflation in the U.S. likely means hyperinflation everywhere.  But, at least we have bitcoin, right?  Right now you could get roughly $28,000 in exchange for a bitcoin. Under hyperinflation with $1 million bitcoin, you can get 35 times that amount for a bitcoin. If you have some bitcoin, that might excite you. But don’t think of this as the dollar value of your bitcoin stack increasing 35 times. Instead, think about the price of bread, gas, rice, steak, cast iron pans, electricity, everything increasing 35-fold. It would be the same for your bitcoin.  And then there’s the glaring problem: How will you even spend your bitcoin? If you’re in a circular bitcoin economic ecosystem like Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador or Bitcoin Lake in Guatemala, you’d probably be fine because they have the infrastructure to support a local economy. But even with the many millions of bitcoiners out there and the many thousands of businesses that accept bitcoin and the hundreds of exchanges that will give you dollars for your bitcoin, is that enough?  Probably not.  Bitcoin needs to service billions of bitcoiners and millions of businesses. And where will those who had no bitcoin before hyperinflation get their bitcoin? Will the exchanges even survive the sudden onset of hyperinflation? Maybe they will. Maybe people will broadly begin accepting bitcoin for payment for goods and services. Maybe some will sell their possessions for bitcoin. Who knows?  The point is that right now bitcoin wouldn’t save us from sudden global hyperinflation. The ecosystem is simply not built out enough. We need more bitcoiners, more businesses that accept bitcoin, more bitcoin companies, more Lightning Network companies (to handle the increased transaction volumes) and more distributed mining.  See also: Paul Dylan-Ennis – The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | Opinion  How many more bitcoiners do we need? How many BTCPay Servers do we need to set up so companies can transact bitcoin?

Ashley Rindsberg is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus festival in April.  The Times was “unabashedly pro-Hitler in The Thirties, serving as a sturdy fount of Dr. Goebbels propaganda” and was “unabashedly pro-Stalin in its coverage of the famine in Ukraine,” writes Rindsberg in “The Gray Lady Winked,” who then elaborates on a series of charges. “You've got a single family in control of this newspaper for 120 years,” Rindsberg said to me in a recent interview. “It's a dynasty. Their interests and their incentives are so misaligned from their reader's interests.”  I’ll admit I’m a skeptic; like most journalists I enjoy and regularly read the New York Times. I’ve written for the paper. I’m hardly unbiased. (And to be more explicit, these allegations are not ones I personally endorse.) But whatever you think of Rindsberg’s specific allegations of the paper, there’s common ground in the idea that, generally speaking, there are fundamental problems in publishing that no one has figured out how to crack.  Read more: Dan Kuhn - Decentralized Social Media – Has the Moment Come?  Rindsberg proposes a solution: Decentralized Media, or “DeMe.” What if citizen journalists were empowered and incentivized to fact-check, do more analysis and make sense of raw data and the world? Rindsberg suspects Web3 could fuel this. “The technological solution is definitely primed for blockchain,” says Rindsberg. “To create a chain of custody for facts, claims and sourcing.”  We might not agree on everything, but the two of us had a lively and respectful conversation about his critique of the New York Times, the structural problems with the space, his vision for decentralized media,and why he thinks that traditional publishing is “optimizing not for objectivity and not for ideals, but for results, page views, clicks and subscriptions.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  When you dug into your research for the book, what surprised you most?  On a general note, it was how willful and obvious some of this stuff was. I hadn’t expected that. They had a Nazi sympathizer running their Berlin bureau in World War II, and they knew it.  Or the gushing praise of the Berlin Olympics, which was this bonanza of racism and antisemitism, and the New York Times is calling it the greatest sporting event in history. That was really unexpected.  Or partnering and collaborating with the Department of War during World War II; when [the U.S.] dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, [The Times] just carried the line, the propaganda that there was no radiation poisoning.  This is a two-part question. Tackle it however you’d like. Do you view these issues at the New York Times as an example of problems that are rampant throughout all mainstream publications? Or maybe this is less about the Times and more about newspapers in general?  And the related question – can you point to another mainstream newspaper that has a better track record? Maybe if you look hard enough, and over a long enough timeframe, you’ll spot problems everywhere.  I think it’s both, in a way. There are some mechanical errors that you see, like when sourcing doesn’t actually have a source, and you see that everywhere. But the New York Times is just bigger, so in a sense it all gets magnified.  But then there’s the ownership structure. You've got a single family in control of this newspaper for 120 years. It's a dynasty. Their interests and their incentives are so misaligned from their reader's interests and what their own reporters' interests and incentives might be, that the divergence is really stark.  Read more: Marta Belcher: Reframing Privacy for the Digital Age  Sometimes people ask me, ""If the New York Times did all this crazy stuff, how come they were able to retain this number-one spot in news?” My response is that it was because they did these things that they stayed number one. It was because they had a pro-Nazi journalist in Berlin in 1939 that they got unbelievable access to Nazi sources that got them the best scoops. There are many examples like this.  So, who's done it better than the Times? I don't know that there's anyone, in a general sense, who's done better. I know that for the book I would frequently go back to look at the Washington Post reporting on the same issue at the same time, just to compare. And the Post was generally pretty sane and commonsensical on most of these topics.  By the way, I should cop to some bias here, in that I sometimes write for the New York Times and of course I read the New York Times and I generally quite like the New York Times.  Oh, I read the New York Times every day. I’m still a subscriber. And if they were ever to ask me to write for them – I don't think it's gonna happen – but I would say yes.  [Both laugh.]  But I think you have to make a distinction between the New York Times’ ownership, which can make disastrous decisions – and forcing those decisions on the newsrooms – and the New York Times’ reporters and journalists, who are doing good stuff, sometimes great stuff.  Let’s widen the lens. How would you summarize the problems with journalism right now?  I think the media talks a lot lately about what they call the trust crisis. We’re seeing all-time lows in trust in media.  But this puts the onus on the readers or on the audience. It is in fact a reliability crisis. It's that we are seeing media operate in ways that do not earn our trust because they're not acting reliably.  Read more: Senator Cynthia 'Crypto Queen' Lummis: Lack of Laws Pushing Industry Overseas  On a more mechanical level, that means using bad tactics like bad sourcing or selective sourcing or the bias of omission or the bias of commission. They're increasingly doing this to advance an agenda – and that could be financial, it could be political or they are doing it to advance a thesis. With journalists, the temptation is always there, right? You come in with a hunch, you come in with a great idea. But as the standard of objectivity is loosened in the news media, these types of practices are encroaching on neutrality, and disinterestedness, and dispassionateness.  And part of the problem is media concentration. We have basically 90% of the news media in the hands of six companies. That adds fuel to the fire because we are optimizing not for objectivity and not for ideals but for results, page views, clicks, and subscriptions. These conglomerates obviously have an overweening financial objective. They have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. And that means the news organization has to deliver, come what may.  As a solution for all this, you’ve proposed Decentralized Media, or DeMe. First off, how do you pronounce that? “Dee-Mee?”  Yeah, Dee-Mee, I guess so. I’ve never said it out loud before.  We just made history. Love it. Let’s talk about DeMe. How do you envision decentralized media as a path forward?  I think the turning point, or at least a signal flashing at the turning point, was FTX and [Sam Bankman-Fried].  I wrote a piece about this for Tablet Magazine. If you look at the coverage of SBF in the prestige media, it’s just the same four tropes, right? Disheveled, genius, altruist, pioneer. And it was gushing, even from the people who are usually extremely skeptical. That went on for two years.  And of course there was the financial involvement of SBF and FTX. In the news media, they're advertising like crazy. They're doing full-page ads in the New Yorker. They’re giving $5 million to ProPublica.  Was it necessarily this exchange of goods? I wouldn’t go that far, but it's gonna influence you. It's gonna influence reporting. Either way, we get the myth of SBF. It took two years to build it. And it took two days to burst it.  And that was done through pretty much two, maybe three outlets: CoinDesk, Richard Chen on Twitter and possibly a Substack account or two. That's decentralized media. I mean, CoinDesk is closer to centralized media, but it's carrying the themes of decentralization.  Then the information was spreading on social media before it ever hit the news media. I think that's the key point. The story was already broken before it got to the New York Times.  Do you see this as a tipping point for DeMe?  Maybe it’s not a tipping point but it's a real indicator of change. What does decentralized media look like in the future? I think it's a lot about changing how we understand reporting. From narrative editorial to something much closer to data interpretation and visualization, but interpretation by the audience. To say, “Here’s the raw data, and here’s the structured data, you audience members gather together on a topic of interest and generate the visualizations. You draw your own interpretations and conclusions from the raw data and put it out into the world in social media.”  Would it replace traditional media, in your view?  I don’t think it’s going to replace, but it's going to be additive. And we're already seeing it happen in real time. We're seeing people trading charts and graphs on social media about important topics and debating it. So, I think that is the future.  Read more: Decentralized Social Media Project Nostr's Damus Gets Listed on Apple App Store  And then there’s what I’m doing with this company that I’m building, called Alitheum, which is giving people the power to understand the reliability of any piece of news media. To take an article or a paragraph and then understand how much bias it has. That’s also the piece of this puzzle – decentralizing media by giving people the power to decide for themselves.  So then you don't have to say, ""The New York Times is not reliable.” I never have to come to that conclusion. I can say, ""Oh, this article meets my reliability standards but that one doesn't, and I don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater."" This boosts my trust level with the New York Times because I verify. That’s something we constantly see in Web3, that trust is one thing but verification is another. Don't just trust, verify.  How does Web3 and blockchain fit into this?  The technological solution is definitely primed for blockchain. To create a chain of custody for facts, claims and sourcing. That’s one of the biggest problems; a New York Times article could link back to its source, but you don't know where the next layer goes and where did that source get it from? And if you go back far enough, did it come from some incredibly dodgy or racist?  So to be able to create that chain of custody, I think that's incredibly important. To be able to validate that people are who they say they are. Or that a journalist has validation that [information] really did come from a certain person. But I think there's also a verification of reliability.  What do you mean by that?  At Alitheum, we’re putting articles into a system where it can say something like, “It used named sources eight times and unnamed sources two times, and it only used a false source once. So we get a rating of 76%, and here’s why.” Or we can look at tonality and how inflammatory or biased the language is.  I'm working with a professor in Zurich who is developing very reliable computational models to measure bias in news. You feed an article into the [artificial intelligence] and it will tell you how much bias is in the article.  I think Web3 will all play another role in this, which is about bringing events on-chain, and turning events into data. That's really what it's about.  Can you give an example?  So, what Citizen does for monitoring crime, right? If there's a crime in your neighborhood, you get a ping. That’s already gone half the distance. Then go a little bit further and say, ""OK, bring that data on-chain. Now it is actually verified."" You can bring it from multiple sources and multiple nodes the way that Chainlink does. Now we have an event that has been turned into data in a way that is verifiable and also that is decentralized, so it's not coming from a single source.  This is such an interesting model. But what about the fact that so many people – including me in many contexts – are just really, really lazy? And they don’t want to spend the time to crunch numbers or analyze data.  Yeah, I think there's some kind of an in-between. You have the Substack model, where you’ve got people who independently say, “I want to cover stories of the Southeast Denver metro beat, which has disappeared completely from the local news because they can’t afford it.” But if every time you want to report on some small or mid-level crime, it’s going to take you the whole day to do the story.  But if you're able to go source the data from your desk and then turn it into a visualization, then you become something like a Substacker/influencer. What we need is a way of gathering information for you, as a single individual, to create meaningful content to feed the audience with relevant stories. This is not about you going to interview four policemen and the victim; that’s not possible with any single individual. You can't do that. So this is a way of solving the supply side [of data] of this news media ecosystem, where we have independent individual creators or journalists.  And there’s also a model where those types of people start to clump together. Like the way that Bari Weiss has done with her Substack. Maybe it's not just you focusing on Southeast Denver, maybe it’s you and a small group, and it’s not just Denver crime but also Denver sports and Denver business. But it's all based in data. It's not about you pounding pavement, it's about you pounding data.  What are the incentives for this? How do you incentivize fact-checking, proper sourcing, and doing the often-tedious work of good journalism?  I think in the short and medium term it’s something like the Substack model. In the case of consumer journalism, it’s not that people will pay a huge price but they’ll pay a price because it’s vitally important to their interests.  And there are models that could even support fact checking. If you’re able to verify a fact in a story, then a way to reward that would be through rewarding tokens. I think that's a fantastic way to do it.  Let me ask you a very boomer question. It’s true that data visualization is compelling and important. But isn’t there journalism that requires a certain amount of experience, expertise and even art?  A nuanced and layered profile piece, for example. It’s hard to see how this is done in a decentralized manner or just by using verified on-chain data. Wouldn’t we lose something by not having this? (And once again, I’ll admit some bias here!)  No, no, that's a good question. I mean, when we had online news it didn’t kill off television news. And television news didn’t kill off the radio. It actually kind of created a renaissance for radio or audio-based reporting.  So I think it is not about replacing, it's about adding to and creating a more robust and more complete media ecosystem.  But I think when you look at something that is very prone to error, even if it’s on the “human” side of the spectrum, like in a battle where you’ve got the fog of war, nobody's able to make sense of what's happening. A journalist who’s cowering behind a rock trying to figure it out has zero chance. How do you piece together what actually happened without making a significant error?  What if with the internet-of-things, with sensors, with geolocation you’re able to track troop movements and then pull that data together and assemble it into a picture of what actually happened in that battle? You don’t have the fog of war, you have the clarity of data. I think the internet of things will be such an important part of that. This may enrich some of the more traditional, narrative-based reporting as well.  Predictions for what news will look like in, say, five or 10 years?  In five years, we're going to be seeing a lot more visualized data, a lot more charts and graphs. We had this spike of interest in data journalism with Nate Silver [founder of Five-Thirty-Eight], and it kind of got absorbed into the larger field. I think that's going to rise again in a much more significant way.  And not just for politics. We're seeing that in sports now, where it’s becoming more data-driven. The [general managers] of sports teams are now data scientists. But on the media side and on the reporting side, it’s still “this player sucks or this player is great.” People will want to understand the data as a first resort, not the last resort of analysis.  And in 10 years?  It will be about connecting the offline world to the online world. Such as using sensors. And I think that's probably going to involve Web3 and blockchain in some significant way, so that in an automated fashion we can show that a certain chain of custody is not broken, or that we understand that events have been verified because of the way that they were brought on-chain. And lots of on-chain data will be analyzed as a kind of news. How that will look, exactly, I’m very curious to see.  You and me both.

42414075,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvfmp,1679674868,U.S. Accounting Board Seeks Crypto Standards Requiring Firms to Report Price Shifts,"U.S. accounting standards may be overhauled to specifically factor in crypto accounting, establishing a fair-value approach that would demand certain digital assets be measured at what they would go for in the markets, according to a change proposed this week by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  That’s a departure from the status quo, which marks only unrealized losses and has been seen by the industry as a barrier to crypto adoption.  The nongovernmental standard-setting board, which is overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, has been working to institute standards for companies’ portfolios of assets such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), and it issued the long-awaited proposal on Thursday. The suggested addition of crypto to accounting rules would make gains and losses part of companies’ quarterly income reports by insisting that swings in value would be reflected each time a company files.  The proposed changes, which are open to public comments until June 6, would also require further disclosures about major crypto holdings.  FASB Chairman Richard Jones said the changes “would provide investors greater transparency into the fair value of crypto assets held by entities, as well as additional disclosures about the types of crypto assets held and changes in those holdings.”  The existing approach, accounting for crypto as so-called indefinite-lived intangible assets, focuses only on the assets dropping in value. According to the board’s proposal, it “does not reflect the underlying economics of those assets and does not provide decision-useful information.”  Companies holding bitcoin on their balance sheets are likely to welcome the move. Electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) and business software developer MicroStrategy (MSTR) have had to record unrealized losses in the past over their bitcoin holdings.  The FASB’s fair-value proposal for crypto doesn’t include tokens that are issued by a company itself, nor does it factor in non-fungible tokens, whose market value is inherently difficult to measure.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/24/us-accounting-board-seeks-crypto-standards-requiring-firms-to-report-price-shifts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be696faf249692709ff269709be633a797bd8eed-3000x1688.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Web3 gaming was also in the spotlight, as Sony filed a patent that could make NFTs transferable between different games and consoles. Meanwhile, blockchains Immutable and Polygon announced a major partnership aimed at making it easier for developers and game studios to jump into Web3.  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  Magic Eden’s Ordinals expansion: Magic Eden has launched its own Bitcoin-based exchange for Ordinals NFTs, expanding its roster of supported blockchains and bridging the gap between Bitcoin maximalists and NFT enthusiasts. The move crowns Magic Eden as the first major NFT marketplace to offer Bitcoin-based collectibles as the battle for market dominance rages on.  Back to its (Tap)roots: The leading marketplace for Solana NFTs said in its announcement that the decision to create a Bitcoin marketplace was reminiscent of its “early days.” In its expansion, Magic Eden hopes to “learn and iterate quickly and support an emerging market.”  No royalties: According to the platform, there aren’t robust solutions for enforcing royalties on Bitcoin. As such, the new marketplace will not support royalties for now.  Sony’s interoperable NFTs: Sony has filed a patent that would make NFTs transferable between games and even non-PlayStation consoles like Xbox. The patent would allow players to use NFTs across virtual reality (VR) headsets, tablets, computers and smartphones.  In-game achievements: According to the patent, NFTs could signify a win in an esports tournament or for completing in-game challenges or levels  Cloud-based video games: The patent aims to make NFTs interoperable across gaming ecosystems and platforms, including cloud-based games.  Powerful partnership: Two of the top players in the Web3 gaming ecosystem, Polygon and Immutable, have formed a strategic alliance to develop blockchain games and take them mainstream. As part of the partnership, Immutable will power its platform using Polygon’s zero-knowledge technology to make onboarding Web3 talent easier and more secure.  Polygon recently launched a business unit devoted to advancing Web3 gaming and has partnered with major brands like Nike, Reddit and Starbucks on different projects.  Immutable will launch an all-in-one passport system in April to make the sign-in and management process easier for Web3 gamers, and has partnered with industry leaders like GameStop, DC Comics and Marvel to build out over 140 new game titles.  Projects on the Rise  Opepen Edition  Who: Created by artist Jack Butcher  What: Jack Butcher has somehow managed to one-up his wildly successful Checks VV project with his new Opepen Edition, a dynamic NFT collection that combines the concept of an open edition NFT sale with the internet’s resurgence of the Pepe meme. The collection of 15,894 NFTs was offered as a free mint in January and is hovering at a floor price of around 0.3 ETH (about $540) on OpenSea at the time of writing.  How: While the collection started out with a Mondrian-esque image of the Pepe meme, Butcher has been continuously changing the collection’s metadata, allowing the image to shapeshift over time. There are also rumors that the collection might serve as a gateway toward a larger future profile picture (PFP) project, broadening the reach of Butcher’s coveted artwork.  In Other News  The Quantum question: A lawsuit disputing the ownership of what is believed to be the first generative art NFT titled “Quantum” by Kevin McCoy was dismissed by a federal judge in New York, who said that Free Holdings did “nothing more than an attempt to exploit open questions of ownership in the still-developing NFT field to lay claim to the profits of a legitimate artist.”  IRS guidance on NFTs: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that NFTs can be treated as collectibles for tax purposes until final rules are agreed upon.  Is wash trading ruining NFT trading?: A recent Twitter thread by kouk.eth, a member of the Ledger team, discusses how the wash trading of NFTs is obscuring trade volume data and sabotaging the NFT market as a whole.  Non-Fungible Toolkit  What Are Dynamic NFTs? Understanding the Evolving NFT  Most NFTs are static, meaning that once a token is minted to a blockchain, the data associated with that token cannot be changed. For example, if you mint a rare, one-of-a-kind artwork as an NFT, that digital image and the data associated with it will remain the same, no matter how much time passes or how many times it changes hands.  On the other hand, a dynamic NFT is a type of NFT that changes based on external conditions, such as events or achievements in a game.

42414076,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvg2k,1679673197,A Three Arrows Capital Founder Talks About His New Crypto Bankruptcy Exchange,"Less than a year after Three Arrows Capital (3AC) imploded along with $2.5 billion of clients' money, the hedge fund's founders, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, are back with a new cryptocurrency exchange where people can trade bankruptcy claims – a hot area given all the distress in the industry.  The Open Exchange (OPNX) was announced last month, garnering wry smiles and smirks. The crypto community hadn't always been so skeptical of the duo. Until the $60 billion Terra ecosystem collapsed last April, they were hailed as messiahs among their peers, touted for running the hottest hedge fund and often endorsed by trading firms and market makers.  That ended bitterly when the market tumbled last year. The company's long-only trading strategy rapidly unwound in a pool of bad debt and unsecured loans before ending in a period of contagion that hit a series of leading crypto businesses. (That includes Genesis, which has the same parent company – Digital Currency Group – as CoinDesk.)  Zhu and Davies attempted to evade the heat by traveling to Singapore. Zhu sold off his Singapore real estate, while a $50 million, 500-ton superyacht dubbed ""Much Wow"" was repossessed after the pair failed to keep up with monthly payments.  Read More: Three Arrows Capital's Su Zhu Looks to Sell $35M Singapore House  After months of relative silence, Davies appeared on CNBC in November. Davies revealed he was living on the island of Bali in Indonesia, which is one of seven countries that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the U.S. After that grilling Davies retreated again, awaiting a moment to reemerge in hopes public perception had swayed.  That moment came earlier this month when Davies spoke to CoinDesk from an office in Dubai – another place with loose extradition laws with the U.S. – about the launch of OPNX.  Copying FTX features  For all of the issues that spurred FTX's demise, Sam Bankman-Fried's exchange offered a series of features that made it stand out from the crowd. Portfolio margin revitalized crypto derivatives trading following the uninspiring user experience that came from the likes of BitMEX. It allowed traders to hold a diverse portfolio while using the nominal value to trade futures contracts.  This has been adopted by OPNX with one difference: Users will be able to use bankruptcy claims as collateral. Given the sheer volume of crypto bankruptcies in the past year, demand for such a product seems likely to be high. But how does it work? What happens when a trade using a bankruptcy claim as collateral gets liquidated?  ""We [OPNX] don't take that claim risk,"" Davies told CoinDesk. ""Let's say you have a $100,000 claim. You move your claim into an SPV [special purpose vehicle]. OPNX then tokenizes that SPV.""  The SPV will then be added to a tranche of related bankruptcy claims that will create liquidity on an order book.  ""If the claim trades at 25 cents, you can sell your claim for $25,000 in stablecoin and withdraw. We will also have a backstop, which will be a large fund that wants to buy below the market,"" Davies added. ""The fund can bid for the entire tranche at, let's say, 20 cents in this case, they can hold it there for a month, then every month adjust it within a range.""  People can use bankruptcy claims, priced against the backstop, as collateral to trade bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) derivatives products. If a trader gets liquidated, the claim will then be sold into the order book, which will eventually hit the backstop price. A backstop is a price point that provides deeper liquidity, intended to prevent an asset from falling below that level.  One of the issues that ultimately plagued FTX was having its sister company, Alameda Research, be the market maker for various trading pairs. This not only created a conflict of interest but also led to Alameda having unlimited risk parameters, which eventually caused a deficit in liquid assets against liabilities.  OPNX won't have internal market makers. Instead, it will pay market makers to ensure that all order books retain a level of liquidity that can deal with the volatility of crypto derivatives trading.  On the surface, OPNX is a novel idea. It has immediate demand from those looking to claw back losses from bankrupt crypto companiesand it has adopted several features that helped FTX become a market leader. Whether investors will put their trust into Davies and Zhu remains to be seen.  A 'legit' – albeit undisclosed – location  Starting a crypto exchange in the current market dynamic is certainly a risk. Macro headwinds and an emerging banking crisis has the potential to put a dent in this year's crypto rout, but OPNX plans to roll out a series of phases that will include tokenizing other assets like real estate and equities.  Regulatory restrictions will be a natural hurdle. Davies said OPNX has applied for a regulated stock exchange license in a currently undisclosed jurisdiction. ""It's a legit jurisdiction,"" Davies said.  When asked whether Davies and Zhu will create another hedge fund or trading firm once the dust settles following the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, Davies was coy and defensive.  ""My thinking right now is that if we want people to judge our product, not us,"" he said. ""If you think about why people are angry, it has nothing to do with me actually. People are angry because the market went down. In terms of us, we have no regulatory action [against us] anywhere, no lawsuits at all. There's just nothing. So they're clearly not mad at anything. They're mad because the supercycle didn't happen, maybe, I don't know. Something like that, right?""

However, in the short term, it has performed extremely well. I view this as critical for why some may want exposure to it and other cryptos. When the market is hit with turmoil, to see it performing well is part of the point. The recent moves have stemmed from a lack of public trust in the U.S. and perhaps European banking system. As deposits appear less safe at smaller institutions, anti-establishment plays have rallied. I personally view this as short-lived since the Fed and the U.S. government are going to work to restore faith in credit markets and the banking sector. While that faith has helped crypto rally, it negates some of the fundamental reasons for owning it as a contrarian play. Main Thesis & Background The purpose of this article is to discuss the broader market and its implications for Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other cryptocurrencies by extension. This is timely because, as readers are surely aware, this has been a challenging few weeks for the broader market. The biggest concern stems from the failure of SVB and subsequent risks of contagion in to other banks and the global banking sector. Yet, over this same time period, the price of Bitcoin has rallied: 1-Week Move (Bitcoin) (Coinbase) Looks great right? Probably time to jump right in and ride this wave? Well, before you do that, consider that a 1-week snapshot doesn't tell the whole story. While this price action is undoubtedly great for holders of the asset, consider performance over the past year. Not too pretty: 1-Year Move (Bitcoin) (Coinbase) This may be hard to make sense of. It certainly is for me, to a degree. So for this review I decided to dig in to what is going on with the market, how BTC is reacting, and why I don't see the recent gains as sustainable. I do see a case for further gains here, but only for those who are truly risk-taking and willing to take some profit when it emerges. Over the longer term, I think sentiment is going to balance out, as sentiment and confidence in the U.S. banking system is likely to rise again with time. Bank Failures And Then Federal Support Catalysts For Gains To begin I will focus on the biggest story for the market - crypto, equities, bonds or otherwise - at this moment. That is certainly the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, followed by the general sell-off of the banking sector on the fear that more banks could follow. This impacted crypto negatively at first as well, as these banks were lenders to the industry. However, I see the general fear by consumers and decline of trust in banks as a whole as a potential reason why BTC has been rallying. This may sound counter-intuitive, but that was what I meant with the title of my article. When people lose faith in ""the system"" - by that I mean the U.S. banking and financial system - that can provide justification for owning non-traditional assets like cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin or otherwise). To understand how real this decline in sentiment is, let us look at the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index. While this does not consider only banking, it does speak to the general mode of the public which has been hammered by these bank failures: Consumer Sentiment Levels (Monthly) (U of Michigan) What I am getting at here is that when the public starts to lose confidence in banks and the regulatory environment as a whole, it starts to lend credence to the currency skeptics that crypto rely on. My point being that when consumers get anxious it can work in two ways. One is that they flee to safety, a normal course of action in my mind. But over the past few years there has been another alternative for people who have lost trust in the USD and other popular currencies. They can move in to the idea of de-regulation and generally unregulated currencies like Bitcoin and others. It is a way to express distrust and rebel against the current ""system"" and continues to grow in popularity and go more mainstream. In fact, despite the risky nature of this sector, we have seen some signs of stabilization. The total market cap of the crypto market, while down in the last few years, has stabilized over the past nine months: Total Cryptocurrency Market Cap (World Bank) This could be another reason investors are flocking back in to crypto. While it is still a very volatile asset, it is getting more stable and well known in relative terms. Comparable to stocks, bonds, or traditional currencies? Of course not. But it is getting more legitimate so that helps underscore the rush of confidence in it when good news comes out. Part of that good news actually stemmed from the bank failures themselves. The ultimate push by regulators and the U.S. government to protect investor deposits at these failed institutions helped restore confidence in assets under custody more broadly. While I personally don't see the optimism on the behalf of crypto investors as entirely justified, it is there nonetheless. The ultimate conclusion here is that if investors feel their money is safe - whether in savings accounts, investment accounts, or crypto accounts - then asset prices are going to be supported and likely to rise. My Concern: Bank Failures Are Not That Rare So I laid out why investor interest in BTC is starting to spike. But are those reasons justified? Personally, I don't think so, and won't be using the recent momentum as a reason to buy. The logic here is simple. Bank failures are really not that rare. This is not to minimize the challenges facing the sector in the short-term. A bank failure is never ""good"" and the risk management failures and subsequent response by the government are not encouraging signs. So their anxiety and anger from the public as a result have plenty of merit. But the point I am making is this is not something that is going to have long lasting ramifications because it is not an unprecedented event. Banks have failed before, and will fail again. The economy has survived these before thanks in part to FDIC insurance programs that prevent a bad situation from getting out of control (generally). For context, consider that while bank failures have been fairly infrequent in the past few years, that has not been the case over longer periods of time: Bank Failures Over Time (FDIC) The conclusion I am drawing here is not to make any dramatic portfolio changes as a result of SVB, Signature Bank, or even if another bank goes under. If crypto was right for you before, then it probably still is now. But the opposite is also true. The market is going to recover from this crisis as it has in the past. To use this cycle as a reason to dive in to an asset like Bitcoin is probably ill-advised. That is my two-cents at least. If Worried About Bank Failures, Bitcoin Probably Is Not The Answer Expanding on the point above, I think the idea that crypto balances are ""safer"" is misguided anyway. For support, let us look to Celsius' own terms of service, which is a now bankrupt crypto lending company. The security of customers' digital assets didn't appear to be a primary concern of theirs: Celsius' Terms of Service (Celsius) in this respect we see the crypto industry has a general lack of safety that we come to expect (and demand) from bank and savings accounts. Investor protections are lacking due to a lack of regulation or oversight body. Does this mean your funds are just going to get stolen overnight? Probably not. But it does limit the recourse one has if there are problems. Celsius' own website called the deposits ""unsettled"" and ""not guaranteed"". If this doesn't scream ""red flag"", I don't know what does. The takeaway for me is that shifting to this sector or taking a less traditional approach due to there being temporary uncertainty in the U.S. banking sector is misguided. I would caution readers from taking on too much risk in this climate, you may end up getting more than you bargained for with a new approach. What Could Push BTC Higher? I have taken a fairly negative tone with respect to Bitcoin's rise in this review. But I am not a complete bear here for a couple reasons. One, momentum in crypto can often be hard to squash immediately, so the good times could roll on from here for a while. Two, investors and households have a lot of cash (and cash equivalents) on hand at the moment. In fact, money market balances are currently at their highest in history, as shown below: Money Market Balances (Total) (Bloomberg) This does not automatically translate to a bull or bear case for Bitcoin specifically. But it does mean there is money out there that could be put to work at a moment's notice. It would be naive on my part to think that some of this liquidity won't make its way in to Bitcoin, especially since the recent gains have got to be intriguing to a lot of people - myself included. Any asset class that is out-performing stocks and bonds by the magnitude Bitcoin has in the short-term warrants at least some consideration. What I see here is a relatively bullish case for most risk-on assets. Now that stocks have sold off, there is a much stronger argument for buying back in than there was a month ago. With all this cash on the sidelines, I see some risk taking as a likely outcome, and Bitcoin is one place that could happen. It won't be for me personally, but this is a trend that isn't going away, even I can recognize that! Banking Concerns Fuel Prospect For Less Hawkish Fed My last thought touches on another output from the banking sector fallout over the past few weeks. This is the belief the Fed is going to back off on its rate-hiking plans and may even begin to cut rates by year-end. The rationale is that the banking sector has pressured the market and caused a bit of a panic, so the time to ripe to ease off the gas. Whether that is going to happen or not is up in the air, but the futures market certainly thinks it will: Funds Rate Expectations (Charles Schwab) This speaks to a key fundamental for BTC's recent rally. The resulting higher interest rates from the Fed over the past year has meant safe-haven assets like Treasurys, bonds, and dividend-growing stocks became more attractive because their yields have increased (new debt issues saw higher yields and dividend growers see their yields rise if all other things are equal). This meant a more risk-off mode has ensued, hurting BTC. Now, the opposite could be true. What has gone down due to Fed rate hiking could be due for a rebound when the Fed stops its current trajectory, or even reverses it. That includes bitcoin. So, again, there is a clear path forward here under the right circumstances, but readers have to be very careful with how they approach it. A lot could ""go wrong"" with this thesis. Bottom-Line Bitcoin has been on a run lately and that certainly piques my interest. But at this juncture, I have to pass because I think the euphoric sentiment is going to smooth out once the negative banking headlines are replaced. That is not to say I won't get in at some point - it is an area I dabbled on in the past. I bought in initially in the mid-40k range and watched my position climb to the mid-60k mark. Unfortunately, I didn't lock in profits then and ended up existing when the price went back down to my cost basis. So I am one of the few crypto writers who will admit to not making any profit in this sector. Yet, I will be vindicated given the collapse in price that has resulted since then. Looking ahead, I may reconsider if the sector takes an unjustified hit. But I don't believe in the long-term story of crypto at this point with enough conviction to plump down a whole bunch of cash there just because equity markets are rattled. I will consider any asset that could make me money at any time, but I don't like the risk-reward trade-off now. As a result, I caution readers to take BTC's recent rise with a grain of salt, and be selective with new positions going forward.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589894-bitcoin-is-benefiting-from-banking-sector-fallout?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11006398.jpeg

42394482,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8KpL,1679669623,What Is Decentralized Identity?,"The ethos of Web3 is about creating a more decentralized digital future that encourages users to take ownership of their own data. In order to navigate this emerging landscape, our personhood is being translated into digital identities that store information about us like our usernames, passwords, search history and past transactions.  Across Web3 decentralized identity systems have cropped up to help users determine how much information is shared and with whom that information is shared. The goal of this technical movement is to remove society’s reliance on the handful of entities to control our digital personas and allow our digital selves to follow us wherever we go.  See Also: What Is 'Web5' and How Is it Different From Web3?  The road to decentralized digital identities  Broadly speaking, digital identities have been around since the advent of the internet. One of the most primitive digital identities still comprises the cornerstone of the web today: the email address. You are represented by a chosen username (“robert”) that precedes a domain name – the organization to which that string is assigned (“coindesk”) – that comes before a final identifier (“.com”). In this case, the email address would be robert@coindesk.com, which provides some information to recipients about the sender's identity and the organization that person is affiliated with.  This structure also reflects a hierarchy of centralized entities. At the bottom of the pile lies Robert, then CoinDesk and then the registrar from whom it ultimately rents the @coindesk domain. And a registrar can only grant access to top-level domains, such as .com, that have been accredited by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN.  As our digital identities have evolved over the years, new dynamics have formed between users and the platforms they frequent. Internet forums have long provided pseudonymous cover for trolls, tinkerers and digital beatniks to discuss topics of interest, provided that these users sign up for an account managed by the forum. In turn, that user must follow the rules outlined by the forum's creator, or else they risk being removed from the platform.  In the 2000s and beyond, social media sites including Facebook and Twitter provided even more advanced digital identities. These sprawling social networks fuzzed around reality, permeating our lives by blurring fact and digitally enhanced fiction. Those that created these platforms have amassed wealth and power by utilizing user information to show personalized ads.  The practices of these social media platforms, the bedrock of what is now known as Web2, at first seemed like a fair bargain to their customers and remain immensely popular. But a series of scandals undermined public trust in these companies and their ability to steward billions of online personas.  Web3’s alternative to a digital identity  While traditional identity tools use centralized methods to store and control user data, decentralized identities integrate blockchain concepts to remove the reliance on third parties.  Decentralized identities are not hosted on centralized servers by big entities such as Google or Meta Platforms (the former Facebook). Instead, they are often hosted on decentralized file-sharing platforms, such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). These open-source protocols store data on decentralized networks that are difficult to shut down and give users ownership over their online data.  In addition, decentralized identities only share information with other parties when and if they choose. This means that, unlike centralized identities, personal data cannot be stored or shared without the user's knowledge or consent.  According to the Ethereum Foundation, decentralized identities can be used for many things, such as a universal login to reduce the need for separate usernames passwords, as a way to bypass know-your-customer (KYC) measures and to create online communities that are free of bots and fake accounts.  Types of decentralized identity solutions  The growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) in recent years has created a need for digital identity systems that can interact with Web3 services and convey credentials without having to provide sensitive personal information.  Non-custodial crypto wallets allow users to transact without the need for an institution. Users control their private keys, which are used to verify transactions and prove ownership of a blockchain address.  Digital identities have evolved since the release of Ethereum in 2015, thanks to smart contracts that can automatically execute tasks when certain conditions are met. Newer systems include the Ethereum Name Service, which allows users to create "".eth"" domains that would replace the long alphanumeric string that marked their wallet’s public address.  Unstoppable Domains is another decentralized identifier that allows users to buy and mint Web3 domain names that are theirs to keep forever.  Soulbound tokens are a type of non-fungible token (NFT) that is not transferable and can help represent a person's identity and achievements in Web3.  Proof of Humanity is a decentralized social identity verification system built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create profiles and vouch for other humans they know.  There is a wealth of future possibilities for decentralized identities, as our self-expression continues to evolve online. NFTs, for example, have recently been used as visual identifiers of someone's identity online, while metaverse platforms and tools have allowed users to create full-body avatars to represent their digital selves.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | ENS,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-decentralized-identity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35cf597b55cdc054c356aebf6d392fb04e7008ba-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gox crypto exchange hack in 2011 to Feb. 18, 2023.  The biggest DeFi hack so far this year was February's of Bonq DAO, a decentralized borrowing protocol. Hackers compromised the protocols’ smart contract and manipulated the price of allianceBlock tokens, draining about $88 million of crypto out of the protocol.  The second-largest DeFi-related attack was on the Platypus Finance protocol, which issues the stablecoin USP. A flash loan attack in February led to the stablecoin depegging and a loss of about $9 million in funds by users. However, unlike many similar incidents, this one ended relatively well: The protocol was able to partly refund users and the investigators tracked down the hackers’ wallets to the Binance exchange, found out who they were and arrested two people in France.  Read more: Anna Baydakova - Coins of War: How Crypto Keeps Feeding Russia's War Despite Sanctions  The report noted that in the single biggest phishing attack so far this year, non-fungible token (NFT) collector Kevin Rose lost about $1 million worth of NFTs after his personal wallet was compromised in late January.  Most of the attacks have targeted vulnerabilities in the code and design of decentralized protocols, which reflects a larger trend in play since 2021: Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been much more popular among hackers than centralized exchanges (CEX).  DeFi protocols were hacked 13 times more than centralized ones in 2022, according to Crystal. The biggest was an attack on the Ronin cross-chain bridge in March 2022, in which $625 million worth of tokens were stolen.  Last year, $4.17 billion were stolen in 199 incidents, the firm said, a higher estimate than Chainalysis' data showing $3.8 billion stolen in 2022. With time, as more information about criminal activity emerges, these estimates may grow, Chainalysis said when it released the data in February.  Crystal also found a growing trend of NFT rug pull scams, when project founders disappear with users’ funds. In 2022, 48 such scams occurred, 41 of them pulled off in the second half of the year, the report says.  Since 2011, more than $16.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency has gone missing in various hacks and scams. U.S.-based companies and projects appear to be targeted most often. But China is home to the most value lost to scams, with $2.25 billion stolen in 2019 from investors in the infamous PlusToken Ponzi scheme and $1.1 billion swindled by the WoToken scam in 2020, Crystal says.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/24/119m-in-stolen-crypto-so-far-in-2023-nft-rug-pulls-on-the-rise-crystal-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10a17f9ee8cafcb8de431c8eca60c18cd342814c-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Matter Labs said zkSync Era, which launched last month for developers only, is now also open to general users.  So-called ZK rollups are a type of blockchain scaling system based on cryptography known as zero-knowledge proofs. A zkEVM is a special type of ZK rollup compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine, a piece of software that executes smart contracts, so it’s easier for developers familiar with the ecosystem to design or reconfigure applications.  Zero-knowledge proofs were invented in the early 1980s, and blockchain developers have been working on ZK rollups for years, but not until now has one been made available to general users with the EVM compatibility.  The competition among developers to reach market first with a zkEVM has been a source of intense speculation this year in blockchain tech circles. Polygon, a rival Ethereum scaling provider, has disclosed plans to push its own zkEVM live on Monday.  “ZK rollups are the Holy Grail of scaling Ethereum but, obviously, only if you can preserve compatibility with the existing ecosystem,” Alex Gluchowski, the CEO of Matter Labs, told CoinDesk.  According to Gluchowski, zkSync Era will have over 200 projects ready to be deployed on the ZK rollup.  He said a differentiator for zkSync Era is that there will be native Account Abstraction, enabling users to have a more user-friendly experience where they can define how they pay their gas (meaning, they won’t need to necessarily pay transaction fees in ether).  Read more: Matter Labs Says zkSync 2.0 Entering New ‘Era’ With Re-Brand and Developer Rollout  The rollup race comes to a close  When Polygon announced the date it would release the first zkEVM on the market, Matter Labs had not publicly shared when it intended to release its version – providing an extra jolt of drama in the competition.  A few days’ difference probably won’t make a huge difference in the long run, but it could confer bragging rights and possibly some extra juice in the marketing.  Gluchowski claims that Matter Labs was “ready to launch earlier” so the team saw little reason to wait.  “We opened the mainnet to developers a month ago,” he said.  ZkSync Era has gone through seven independent security audits, according to Matter Labs’ press release.  Gluchowski also noted that the team is referring to Friday’s opening as the “Alpha launch” because he wants to warn users that this is a new technology so “ people should take it carefully.”  “We don't want people to bridge a lot of funds and, like, just ape into it,” he said.

42414088,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvgTH,1679666299,Here's Why Crypto Traders Should Be Attentive to 'De-Inversion' of Treasury Yield Curve,"Crypto traders looking for cues on whether bitcoin's (BTC) bull run could continue without disruptions should look at what the U.S. bond market is saying.  Bitcoin has gained over 60% this year, starting the pre-halving bullish period with a bang, CoinDesk data shows. Prices rose to a nine-month high near $29,000 this week, predominantly due to the recent rapid repricing of interest rate expectations lower across the globe.  Still, bulls need to be cautious because the negative spread between yields on 10-year and two-year Treasury notes is beginning to narrow. The gap between the two has reduced sharply by 80 basis points in two weeks and was just 30 basis points short of turning positive at press time.  Historically, the so-called de-inversion or re-steepening of the curve has meant that economic recession – consecutive quarterly contractions in growth rate – is just a few months away, and portended significant drawdowns in stock markets. Bitcoin is seen as both a haven and an emerging technology and tends to move in line with technology when macroeconomic concerns dominate the investor psyche.  ""Keep an eye on the yield curve ‘de-inverting’. We’re now getting close. The day that happens after an inversion, the countdown to recession starts in earnest: average of 4 months and median of 2 months,"" David Rosenberg, founder and president of Rosenberg Research & Associates, tweeted.  Thomas Thornton, founder of Hedge Fund Telemetry, expressed a similar opinion as early as August, saying that ""when the curve steepens, recessions happen and stocks fall.""  The chart compares the spread between the 10- and two-year yields with Nasdaq going back 1980s. The vertically shaded area represents economic recessions.  The curve has always normalized or re-steepened into recessions, bringing pain to Nasdaq, Wall Street's tech-heavy equity index.  If history is a guide, tech stocks could come under pressure, dragging bitcoin lower if the ongoing de-inversion of the yield curve gathers steam.  Understanding the yield curve  The yield curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between interest rates and the maturities of U.S. Treasury fixed-income securities. Bond yields and prices move in the opposite direction. The curve usually is steep because investors demand higher compensation for lending money for longer durations.  Analysts closely track spreads between long- and short-duration yields to gauge the economic direction. Yields on longer-duration bonds or at long ends mainly represent expectations for economic growth, while those at the short end are more reflective of interest rate expectations.  The curve typically inverts when a central bank raises rates rapidly, as the U.S. Federal Reserve has done over the past 12 months, leading to a sharp rise in the two-year yield relative to the 10-year yield. The latter lags as growth expectations slide due to monetary policy tightening.  Once the negative economic impact of the tightening become evident, markets begin pricing rate cuts. That eventually drives the two-year yield lower relative to the 10-year yield, causing a de-inversion of the spread, a confirmation of recession.  Hence, curve inversion or the spread's negative flip has long been viewed as a sign of pending economic recession and de-inversion a sign the recession has arrived.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/24/heres-why-crypto-traders-should-be-attentive-to-de-inversion-of-treasury-yield-curve,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4ea95841ff0dc3e3059c402ac0822b14ac61db9-1920x1272.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The stock market exchange operator's senior vice president and head of digital assets, Ira Auerbach, said the firm is working on getting the necessary infrastructure and regulatory approval in place. Nasdaq applied to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) for a limited-purpose trust company charter which would oversee its custody service.  Nasdaq announced its intentions in September as it looked to respond to the demand from institutional crypto investors.  Traditional finance companies such as Nasdaq are looking to fill the gap left by more crypto-centric firms that have shut their doors in recent months, with exchange FTX and banks Silvergate and Signature the most prominent.  Should appetite for crypto among the likes of Nasdaq remain strong, it may prove a positive signal for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption.  Nasdaq did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.

On Wednesday evening, Coinbase said it received a warning that staff at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recommended enforcement action against the company for allegedly breaching of securities laws. That sent COIN sharply lower Thursday and spurred Oppenheimer to downgrade to Perform from Outperform. In response to the Wells notice, which covers Coinbase's ( COIN ) listed digital assets, its staking service, among other services, the platform said it remains ""confident in the legality of our assets and services, and if needed, we welcome a legal process to provide the clarity we have been advocating for,"" according to a March 22 blog post. That said, Cowen sees the possibility that the company is heading for litigation against the regulator, ""which we expect to create an overhang on shares,"" the firm wrote in a note to clients. And ""to the extent listed crypto assets are deemed securities, it could exacerbate trading volume deterioration,"" Cowen warned, while contending that COIN's blockchain rewards revenue would be negatively affected should the company be forced to close its staking business. The Underperform rating diverges from the Quant system rating and the average Wall Street analyst rating, both at Hold. JMP analyst Devin Ryan, meantime, maintained his Market Perform rating on COIN given this year's more favorable operating backdrop with the crypto market value up almost 50% from the end of 2022. ""Considering the expense steps the company has been taking, we currently believe it has the resources to operate until we progress to a clearer regulatory path – which we remain hopeful will be the end outcome,"" he wrote in a note to clients.

The ARB token serves as a means of governance for the protocol. Holders of ARB can participate in decision-making processes, such as proposing and voting on protocol upgrades or changes.  Among crypto exchanges, Bitget and Huobi led volumes with over $250 million worth of ARB traded. Decentralized exchange Uniswap, which relies on smart contracts to match trades between users, saw over $227 million in trading volumes – which netted over $500,000 in fees for liquidity providers.  ARB traded over $1.43 at press time on Friday, garnering a market capitalization of $1.8 billion based on a circulating supply of 1.25 billion ARB, according to CoinDesk data.  Meanwhile, some market observers see growth ahead for ARB tokens but warned about short-term volatility.  “We’re seeing a feverish trading environment for ARB tokens as the airdrop just launched. Airdrops logically garner a lot of retail attention, but often result in the price tanking as traders offload their tokens rapidly,” said Henry Liu, CEO of BTSE, in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.  “Despite the selling pressure from the airdrop, it remains to be seen what potential utility there is, and whether integration into Arbitrum’s wider [decentralized finance] system could provide some new impetus for bullish sentiment,” Liu added.",POSITIVE,ARB,EXCHANGE | TRADING | ARB | AIRDROP | FORKS,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/24/arbitrum-tokens-rack-up-2b-in-trading-volume-analysts-point-to-growth-ahead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3780930edc3bf643e304241eac26f2a57a73fb1-993x559.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  After a week of adverse regulatory news and macroeconomic events, bitcoin has held fairly strong. The cryptocurrency is up 3% on the week and has managed to hold the $28,000 mark on Friday after reaching highs of $28,700 earlier in the week. Ether gained 2% on the day and reached $1,800 earlier in the week for the first time since August. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday urged investors to exercise caution when investing in crypto assets and issued a Wells Notice to crypto exchange Coinbase earlier in the week. Coinbase's stock slumped as much as 20% in early trading Thursday following the news.  Federal prosecutors in New York charged Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon with fraud hours after he was arrested by police in Montenegro. ""Montenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs,"" Montenegro's minister of interior, Filip Adzic, tweeted Thursday. Kwon has been the target of several investigations and was even on Interpol's red notice after stablecoin terraUSD (UST) and its $40 billion ecosystem imploded last year, sending shockwaves across the crypto markets.  Some Binance employees and trained ""volunteers"" are helping users in China and other countries evade Binance's know-your-customer (KYC) controls, CNBC reported Wednesday, citing Chinese-language messages from a Binance-controlled Discord server and Telegram group. The message group participants, called ""Angels,"" share techniques such as forging bank documents, falsifying addresses and hiding the country of origin to allow users to bypass controls and obtain a Binance debit card, according to the report. China banned crypto exchanges in 2017 and cryptocurrencies altogether in 2021.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows liquidity in the bitcoin market, as measured by a metric called the 2% market depth – a collection of buy and sell orders within 2% of the mid-price.  The market depth has dropped to 10-month lows, indicating a tough time for traders looking to execute large buy and sell orders at stable prices.  ""The closure of the Silvergate Exchange Network and wind-down of Signature bank's real-time crypto payment network, some of the only USD payment rails for crypto, resulted in U.S exchanges being harder hit from a liquidity standpoint as market makers in the region face unprecedented challenges to their operations,"" Connor Ryder, a research analyst at Kaiko, wrote in a market update.

When Animoca initially unveiled its plans for the fund in November, its target was $2 billion. This was then cut in half to $1 billion in January.  The firm was valued at almost $6 billion following a $75 million fundraise in July. However, its market cap in secondary markets has slipped below $2 billion, according to the report, citing two other people.  The metaverse is a term for a virtual world where the internet exists as an immersive space that can be used for work, play, socializing, experiences and events. While there is much excitement about its potential in some quarters, it remains a largely unproven concept.  As such, appetite for metaverse-related investment may have taken a hit in recent months as the broader digital asset industry's winter has shown little signs of thawing, from the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November to those of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate and Signature this month.  In response, Animoca said the initial $2 billion figure offered in November was the upper end of a $1 billion-$2 billion range it was targeting.  ""There's no doubt that the FTX and banking crises have had a serious impact on available venture capital, but fundraising for the Animoca Capital fund is in progress, the firm said.""

42387848,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQuWHL,1679658339,Binance Suffers Two-Hour Spot Market Outage Due to Software Bug,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance suspended trading on its spot markets for two hours Friday because of a computer bug related to the trailing stop loss feature.  The world's largest crypto exchange announced that it suspended spot markets at 11:38 UTC. Roughly one hour later, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao revealed that ""engine one,"" referring to one of the trading engines, was back online and that it was waiting for the other engines to catch up.  CZ described the event as ""unlucky"" before stating that the outage followed ""standard operating procedure.""  A trailing stop is a type of market order that gradually reduces a position once the price of the asset hits a number of price triggers.  Crypto exchanges are prone to experiencing downtime during periods of trading volatility. Gemini suffered a seven-hour outage in December and Coinbase was forced into an outage after an advertisement was shown at last year's Super Bowl.  News of the outage caused about a $700 dip in the price of bitcoin (BTC), but by the time Binance trading came back online at 14:00 UTC, bitcoin had returned to about the $28,000 level.  Binance suffered an outage in November 2021 that lead to a lawsuit from a group of Italian investors who claimed to have racked up ""tens of millions"" in losses.  Binance has facilitated over $13 billion in spot trading volume in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

42387846,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQuWCf,1679656465,Bitcoin Mining Industry Is Well Positioned to Participate in a New Cycle: Bernstein,"The mining industry is well positioned to participate in a new bitcoin (BTC) cycle, Bernstein said in a research report Thursday.  The broker sees positive catalysts from the largest cryptocurrency’s safe haven status, the reward halving due early 2024 and lower energy and equipment costs.  Rising bitcoin prices – the largest cryptocurrency by market cap has climbed 70% this year – and easing energy and equipment costs bode well for cash generation and the leverage position of miners, the report said. This should help improve gross margins in 2023.  If the bitcoin price continues to rally, Bernstein expects miners’ production in March and April to exceed their BTC liquidations, leading to a net increase in holdings of the cryptocurrency. This could help the companies’ debt repayment positions because bitcoin held as treasury assets can be liquidated at better prices to meet debt obligations.  In the medium to long term, the next main catalyst for miners is the halving, the note said. Roughly every four years, the total number of bitcoin that miners can potentially earn is cut by 50%.  “Halvings make BTC more scarce by reducing supply, thus leading to prices rising,” and this results in more miners joining the network, which increases the hashrate and the network security.  If the 2024 halving follows the same pattern as earlier ones, the BTC mining industry would see “lower competitive intensity” due to the sector’s wipe-out in the bear market of 2022, and higher bitcoin prices, which would deliver improved profitability before additional mining capacity comes online, the report added.

The department plans to revolutionize its vehicle title and transfer management system by tokenizing the more than 14 million automobiles registered in the state. It will issue vehicle titles as non-fungible-tokens (NFT) with ownership recorded on a private version of the Tezos blockchain. NFTs are digital assets that represent ownership of virtual or physical items that can be sold or traded.  “Tokenization of vehicle titles could also enable fractionalized vehicle ownership, allow holders to pledge vehicle-title NFTs as collateral in the real world or within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and increase liquidity on vehicle marketplaces,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.  Bank of America says the project may cut the process of issuing and transferring vehicle titles from weeks to minutes, allow for more secure ownership transfer through smart-contract enabled escrow accounts, decrease fraudulent activity and encourage automation to lower costs.  The project is seen as a first step with the potential for additional functionality, the note said. These may include the ability to record repairs within the NFT, to use stablecoins as the payment leg for “atomic title transfers” and allow vehicle-licensing agencies from other states to join the platform so they can benefit from the same efficiencies as well as producing incremental efficiencies related to cross-state vehicle sales.  The bank notes that other federal and state agencies are also looking at blockchain-based solutions. These include the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Homeland Security and the California Department of Food and Agriculture.

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, usually the U.S. dollar.  The bank says stablecoin trading volumes spiked higher after March 8, when crypto-friendly bank Silvergate said it would voluntarily liquidate and wind down operations. It notes that tether (USDT) has captured a larger share.  JPMorgan says the collapse of the three banks has affected crypto firms in different ways. Crypto companies with diversified banking partners, like some exchanges, were less affected.  “The banking crisis could present an opportunity for some exchanges which could gain market share by offering banking services to crypto-native firms and investors,” the note said.  Still, in the longer term it is vital for the crypto ecosystem to replace the banking networks that have been lost so that fiat currency can be transferred efficiently and securely between market participants, “ensuring at the same time the stability of the stablecoin universe,” the note added.  The tougher U.S. regulatory stance might drive crypto market participants to banking networks in Europe and Asia, the report added.

On Tuesday, Cathie Wood’s fund sold 160,887 shares of Coinbase for $13.5 million when the stock was at approximately $83 a share. Just over 48 hours later, ARK bought the dip and purchased 268,928 shares of COIN as the stock fell and closed Thursday in the U.S at $66.30.  According to an email sent out Thursday night U.S. time, 230,599 of these shares went to ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) while 38,329 of these shares went to the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).  In the course of those two days, Coinbase disclosed that it received a Wells Notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which warns a business the SEC is planning to take enforcement action against it.  A Wells Notice signifies that the SEC has concluded an investigation and believes the evidence it has gathered is substantial enough to warrant enforcement action. It doesn’t guarantee that enforcement action will take place, and Coinbase has until March 29 to advise the SEC if it plans on contesting the enforcement action.  The SEC also announced on Wednesday that it is suing Justin Sun, the Tron Foundation, the BitTorrent Foundation, and Rainberry (formerly BitTorrent) for selling unregistered securities and manipulating the market via wash trading. Internet personality Jake Paul is also being sued for his alleged illegal promotion of Sun-linked crypto.  In a recent Twitter space, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, said the company was going to get more politically involved and call on its U.S.-based users to elect “pro-crypto candidates.”  “What we’re going to do is start putting out content where people can contact their congressman, donate to pro-crypto candidates, show up at town halls, make your voice heard,” he said. “We are going to elect pro-crypto candidates in this country to make sure that our success is ensured.”  Despite the Wells-induced dip, COIN is still up 97% year to date.  ARK also disclosed that it has purchased 320,557 shares of Block (SQ), with 275,554 of these shares going to ARKK.
