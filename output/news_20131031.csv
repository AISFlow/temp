42425117,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr17h,1383261694,Taking bitcoin to a whole new level: Jeremy Allaire reveals all about Circle,"Jeremy Allaire is already pretty well known in the tech world, having played an integral part in the creation of ColdFusion, the Macromedia MX (Flash) platform, and online video platform Brightcove. However, he just stepped even further into the limelight.  Allaire is now heading up a new company called Circle, which aims to take the bitcoin market by storm. It's made a mighty good start, too, having secured $9m in Series A funding – the largest amount ever raised by a bitcoin company.  CoinDesk spoke to Allaire to find out what Circle is all about, where the name came from and just what, exactly, he plans to do with all that cash.  CD: Tell us how Circle came about  JA: Last year I took my company Brightcove public and in January this year I stepped from the CEO role into the chairman role, which gave me a bit more time to look for something new.  I had been tracking digital currency for a while, but I then started to look more closely at it and saw how exciting it was. I was as excited about it as when I experienced the Internet in its first days – when I saw the first web browser.  It really struck me as a totally transformational technology and I immediately began thinking about how bitcoin could become as significant as email, or Skype.  This spring, I started looking really closely at the technology and the ecosystem and kind of came up with the ideas behind Circle.  Why did you choose the name Circle?  Choosing a name is really hard, especially these days – there are hardly any decent ones left! We wanted a name that was a real word – not something made up – and that truly represented the global nature of digital currency.  We found the domain name Circle.com – it was expensive, but we really liked it and just had to have it.  From what's been announced, it looks like you're going to offer similar services to BitPay and Coinbase. What makes Circle different?  We've not launched our products publicly yet, so there are some things I can't comment on, but I think both Coinbase and BitPay are very solid companies and are making great progress in the space.  [post-quote]  I think at the same time, though, it's very early days and there's still a lot that needs to be done.  What is Circle's main focus?  A lot of what we're working on centres on making bitcoin extremely easy for consumers and merchants to adopt. We want to make participating in digital currency as easy as participating in other key technologies on the web – email, Skype or basic applications.  It still takes a lot of time for consumers to get access to digital currency and actually use it. We are really deeply focused on making this a really easy, straightforward and pleasant experience for consumers and businesses that want to start accepting and using digital currency.  We really want to engage in the broader ecosystem to make the bitcoin experience better for everyone. I think there is tremendous opportunity to work with other companies that are complementary and we're very excited to work more closely with merchants who are interested in accepting bitcoin.  Will Circle only support bitcoin, or will it support altcurrencies too?  We are very focussed on bitcoin. I think right now bitcoin is the only game in town. It has established a real marketplace and infrastructure all across the world, but how this evolves is, of course, unknown.  But over time I think the standards will have to evolve, so whether in the distant future the main digital currency is called bitcoin or it works in another way, we don’t really know. But we do know that bitcoin is the foundation.  When are you launching Circle's products?  We want to have a beta as soon as possible, but while we prepare for that, we're very much focused on making sure Circle is compliant – not just to keep the authorities happy, but to prove to consumers that we're trustworthy.  There's a lot that needs to be done to educate and work with regulators and policy makers and I think that over time this will shape who is able to be a viable player in the space.  You're registered as a money transmitter with FinCEN, was that a difficult process?  Not at all, you don’t have to go through a significant vetting process, you just have to register with the federal government and be compliant with the core know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) rules.  The real problems come at the state level. If you're a 'money services business', the state wants to be able to oversee the business you do with consumers in their state.  A lot of new innovative financial products have emerged over the past 10 to 20 years and the states have had to try and get their heads around each one. PayPal and pre-paid cards, for example, were new kinds of money service businesses at one point and each state took their time to figure out what to do, but they got there in the end.  What are you going to do with your $9m Series A funding?  We currently have 14 people on the team so first of all we want to expand that with more engineer and business roles in both Boston and our international HQ in Dublin, Ireland.  The engineers will work on building out our products, but, during this time, we'll also focus on increasing our compliance personnel. We've realised that compliance is key.  Thanks Jeremy, anything else you'd like to add?  Just that we're really excited about the digital currency space and market and we're looking forward to contributing to the community and hopefully turning bitcoin up a notch and taking it into a completely new scale of use!",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/31/taking-bitcoin-to-a-whole-new-level-jeremy-allaire-reveals-all-about-circle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ddda0d8c7ea5fd6e2ab0c1c078d8ad68f293ee6-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42425120,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr1Fh,1383232528,New SatoshiDICE owner launches Tribute game,"The owners of SatoshiDICE are launching a new game, called SatoshiDICE Tributehttps://satoshidice.com/tribute. The new site will conduct its transactions off the block chain, say the owners.  It is still not publicly known who purchased the original SatoshiDICE site from Erik Voorhees in July for 126,315 BTC, but a representative said that the firm was adding enhancements into the new game. It will include session-based accounts and a developer API, they told CoinDesk.  “Casinos that haven't integrated bitcoin are really doing their players a disservice. They might as well take down their website and offer bets via carrier pigeon,” joked Kat Brown, head of product and marketing for the firm.  The new game, which cost between $100,000 and $1m to produce, was in development before Voorhees sold the firm, said the source. The development (which was handled by contractors, as SatoshiDICE has no full-time employees) was all paid for via bitcoin.  What did all those bitcoins buy? One of the new features is called ‘Tribute’, which gives a portion of every roll’s wager to the top three ranked players on the site (rankings change all the time, and are reset to zero daily).  The firm didn’t say what the Tributes would be, but claimed that players could earn “hundreds of bitcoins” through Tribute payments.  The session-based accounts mean that Tribute is played off the block chain, as opposed to the original SatoshiDICE, which at one point accounted for between a quarter and a half of all block chain transactions. Deposits and withdrawals are still handled via the block chain, as zero-confirmation transactions. Brown said:  “SatoshiDICE Classic, and the new Tribute, are both provably fair, though they use somewhat different systems to accomplish this.""  “The block chain demonstrates irrefutably that a transaction took place, but it doesn't by itself verify a calculation related to that transaction. Verifying the calculations of a gaming roll is the tricky part, and that's where the provably fair bitcoin games (whether SatoshiDICE or others) have really innovated. Consumer protection is now accomplished via math instead of via bureaucrat.”  Specifically, the system uses a value called a ‘daily secret’, which changes every 24 hours and is revealed the day after betting. This is combined with two other numbers: the client seed, which is a string of digits provided by the player, who can change it at any time. Another number, the account seed, is a random value attributed to each player account.  All of these are combined with a bet number, tied to each account, which increases by one for each bet.  The result is a ‘lucky number’, produced by running them through a SHA-256 hashing function and taking the first four bytes of the result. The idea is to produce a number with input from the player that therefore cannot be rigged by SatoshiDICE.  Interestingly, SatoshiDICE uses math to justify not revealing the identity of its owner (who has other gaming interests).  “There is no benefit to revealing who we are. The legitimate purpose of knowing a business owner is to know whether he or she is trustworthy,” said Brown. “Bitcoin technology, and the provably fair system SatoshiDICE uses, goes far beyond that – demonstrating trust through mathematics instead of identity.”  Neither will SatoshiDICE reveal its figures anymore. Although it stopped shortly before the sale was announced, when Voorhees owned SatoshiDICE it would publish its monthly financials.  “This was done for the sake of transparency with SatoshiDICE's anonymous, individual stakeholders (there was no way to directly communicate with them),” said Brown. “After the sale, this is no longer necessary, though we admit it was economically interesting.”  The Tribute game will not replace the original SatoshiDICE, which is now called SatoshiDICE Classic.  The feature set is different enough that the original stands on its own, argues Brown:  “Surely the new game will cannibalize some users of the original, and that's fine. We know some players have found creative uses and applications for the original, so they don't need to worry about it going away.”  The session-based nature of the new game means that it could theoretically be more susceptible to DDoS attacks.  Previously, a DDoS on the SatoshiDICE site didn’t disrupt gameplay because transactions were handled by the block chain. With everything happening off-chain, that is no longer the case, so the firm has had to sign with an anti-DDoS provider.  Like the original, SatoshiDICE Tribute will be closed to US players, said Brown, citing uncertainty about US attitudes to bitcoin-based gaming.  The firm takes a contentious approach to US regulation. Brown, who likes the slogan ""entertainment while fiat crumbles”, argues that the US is behind the curve when it comes to bitcoin.  “Watching how other countries are taking an open and tolerant approach to bitcoin innovation, while the US goes around subpoenaing, fining, and imprisoning people, we wonder whether the US itself, like banks, will become irrelevant?” she asked. “We hope not. America has so much potential to be a great country.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/31/new-satoshidice-owner-launches-tribute-game,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01b96f2949606817161b0447bfbf029c55ae236d-1024x857.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425112,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr11h,1383220691,Banking innovation depends on bitcoin,"With one firm swoop, banks could eliminate the threat from Apple, Google, and PayPal by embracing the new bitcoin cryptocurrency. Disruption doesn't always come from the outside but revolutions do form at the periphery, which is precisely where bitcoin sits today.  It's easy to talk about conventional financial services disruption such as digital banking and mobile payments, because we've seen the information age already disrupt entrenched industries.  We know that banking in the future will be something you do – not some place you go – and aggressive fintech startups already provide the innovation that's occurring in the financial services space.  Combine that fact with the existing platform behemoths of Apple (iPhone iOS) and Google (Android) and banks fear losing the customer relationship on the road to becoming a non-strategic utility.  By altering the monetary unit of account and deploying it as a competitive wedge, bitcoin offers disruption within disruption, or even supreme disruption. But the question invariably becomes ""how do banks make money with bitcoin?"".  On a primary level, bitcoin represents a new currency opportunity for banks. The term banknotes is actually left over from the period when banks issued their own currency notes in an environment of free banking and currency competition.  It is by no means out of historical context for banks to re-establish themselves in the competitive money business. Besides, bitcoin doesn't even claim to represent anything similar to legal tender.  Imagine the following bank board meeting around a giant mahogany wood table where the board directors are more obsessed with escalating compliance requirements than innovation.    Bitcoin Advocate: Our bank needs to embrace bitcoin because we need some of Schumpeter's ""creative destruction"". Beyond simple return-on-equity, we need relevancy and survival.      Board Director: But won't all this innovation and disruption raise the level of scrutiny from the regulators? Our entire bank staff is already 30% anti-money laundering compliance attorneys acting as quasi-agents for law enforcement.    Bitcoin Advocate: You need to leverage that legal advantage and not be afraid. Bitcoin is not against the law in any jurisdiction in the world. Our bank needs to lead and be first because if we don't, then some other bank will, or even worse, a non-bank.    Board Director: Well, doesn't bitcoin ultimately dis-intermediate banks? Where is the long-term revenue opportunity?    Bitcoin Advocate: It's a new and decentralized world with block chains, hash rates, and distributed consensus. The business opportunities are about efficiency, more clients, new revenue streams, frictionless global payments, and improved risk management. Let me show you.    It's not really hard to imagine that type of conversation, especially considering the demographics of digital currency users.  What's even worse for banks is that the current generation doesn't ever want to step into a branch. It's difficult for banks to formulate a strategy that doesn't involve ""eating their young"".  The digital currency revolution is already happening in deposit taking, online trading, mobile payments, and merchant processing.  Shifting the monetary unit of account to cryptographic money supported by market-based legitimacy rather than regulatory-based legitimacy is allowing innovation on an entirely new level thus permitting engineers and businesses to enter the value transfer market without being subject to the confines of legacy systems or preconceived notions of ""exclusive"" legal tender.  Deloitte in the United Kingdom recognizes this seismic impact on retail banking and IBM's executive architect believes that the bitcoin technology will change the world.  Entrepreneur-led startups with few employees and no formal financial expertise manage millions of dollars worth of bitcoin deposits as global cryptocurrency banks.  Small fintech companies link to banks online and make a two-way market in bitcoin 24 hours a day and seven days a week.  Elegant bitcoin wallets on Android and iOS offer point-to-point transaction clearing making the mobile telephone dongle attachment look old-fashioned and unnecessary.    Startups process merchant deposits in bitcoin providing immediate conversion services to national currencies.    Banks own the trust game and it is their game to lose.  For better or worse, a majority of people still prefer banks over trusting Apple, Google, or PayPal with sensitive data. Security at banks and financial institutions usually represents the strongest in the world among private businesses.  For those individuals desiring a third-party safe keeper for their bitcoin balances, banks could provide several obvious advantages.  Efficient exchange services are also the domain of banks. Trading and market making for bitcoin (XBT) pose no more challenges than dealing in foreign currencies, derivatives, or interest rate swaps. Bank expertise in this area is a natural fit for bitcoin currency trading.  Think of it as a typical build versus buy decision. In many cases today, banks are being asked to serve as financial partners for bitcoin-related enterprises that are a direct assault on a bank's core competencies. Adopting the business model of some of these bitcoin-related companies goes a step beyond mere banking services, however that is the difference between an innovator and a utility.  We are witnessing the emergence of a new paradigm made possible by peaceful monetary revolution. Banks can either play or watch.

42425092,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwRh,1383213432,"Circle launches with $9 Million from Jim Breyer, Accel and General Catalyst in biggest ever bitcoin funding","A new startup has launched in the bitcoin ecosystem, backed by $9m of Series A funding from a number of notable tech investors.  Called Circle Internet Financial, or just 'Circle', the company was founded by Jeremy Allaire, co-founder of Allaire Corporation, which created the web development language ColdFusion.  Circle aims to drive mainstream adoption of bitcoin and other digital currencies by offering simple payment services for both businesses and consumers.  Those who contributed to the $9m in funding include Jim Breyer, Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners, which were all investors in Allaire’s previous company, Brightcove – the online video platform.  This is the greatest amount of funding achieved by a digital currency company to date. To put this in perspective, bitcoin wallet service and payment processor Coinbase received $6.11m in Series A funding led by Union Square Ventures, and BitPay have received around $2.5m to date from Founders Fund and various angels.  Bringing bitcoin to the masses  Circle aims to make life easier for both merchants and customers who wish to become involved in bitcoin.  Consumers can use Circle to exchange, store, send and receive digital currency, whereas business and charities can use the company's services to accept cryptocurrency payments in a hassle-free way.  ""Bitcoin and digital currency represent a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to shape the future of the Internet and global commerce,"" said Allaire.  ""There's a tremendous opportunity to make payments easier, more secure and less costly for consumers and businesses. Digital currency can dramatically reduce the friction and costs currently experienced in the world by merchants and consumers,"" he added.  Jim Breyer, partner at Accel Partners, said it is rare for a ""world-class entrepreneur"" such as Allaire to embark on a plan aimed at bringing innovation to the global financial marketplace. He added:    “The dramatic global growth in mobile, social and online commerce is creating the need and potential for a real global digital currency.      With Jeremy’s vision for Circle and track record as an Internet pioneer, the opportunity here is to potentially build a significant global company. I’m very pleased to be working with Jeremy again.”    Regulated and compliant  A number of bitcoin companies across the world have faced problems with regulators over the past six months, Circle, however, has worked with regulators to ensure it is sufficiently regulated.  The company is currently regulated as a money transmitter by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and is seeking appropriate licenses on a state level.  [post-quote]  Circle also recently hired a new general counsel and chief compliance officer – John Beccia, who is former Chief Regulatory Counsel for the Financial Services Roundtable in Washington, DC.  Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, suggested the addition of another big business to the bitcoin space will help develop and improve new and existing regulatory guidelines in the US.  ""Prominent business leaders and VCs will not sit still for long and tolerate stifling regulation. I see more engagement from these new companies on best practices and contributing to the educational dialogue with government,"" he said.  Matonis went on to warn that if digital currency companies are not permitted to operate in the US, they will soon find a receptive home elsewhere.  What do you make of Circle?
