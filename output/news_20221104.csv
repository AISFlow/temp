The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently still around $21,000, up about 4% for the last 24 hours and over the upper end of the narrow range it has occupied for weeks. The oldest cryptocurrency has been hovering nearer to $20,000 for much of the past 10 days.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  ""Today’s employment report triggered a wave of volatility that ended up being positive for risky assets, which has helped bitcoin rally above the $21,000 level,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email.  Ether was recently changing hands above $1,600, a more than 6% gain and the first time since mid-September that the second-largest cryptocurrency had topped that threshold. Other altcoins enjoyed an upbeat Friday, with MATIC recently rising more than 21% and CRO up over 11%.  As CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported, MATIC’s rise may stem from Web2 giant Meta's decision to launch a toolkit allowing users of social media platform Instagram to mint and sell Polygon-powered non-fungible tokens (NFT), or digital collectibles. Polygon is the first partner that Meta has chosen for the new feature.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, soared almost 5%.  The crypto market’s spike followed the unexpectedly robust jobs report showing that U.S. payrolls added 261,000 jobs in October, beating economist forecasts for 200,000. The unemployment rate rose to 3.7% versus expectations for 3.6%.  The uptick in unemployment and a sizable decline in the household survey of 325,000 jobs encouraged at least one economist, Dartmouth’s Danny Blanchflower, that the hot jobs market was beginning to reverse, a good sign in the ongoing struggle to tame inflation: ""We are now in a position ... to expect the Fed to go into full reverse gear as the labor market is set to crash,"" Blanchflower tweeted. ""Rate cuts are coming,"" he added.  Equity markets rose more moderately, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all gaining more than a percentage point. Safe haven gold made a rare rare comeback, increasing 3%.  Oanda’s Moya noted optimistically, “A downshift to a slower pace of tightening still seems in the cards for the Fed and that should provide some short-term support for cryptos.”  Latest Prices  ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): 1,060.45 +4.3%        ● Bitcoin (BTC): $21,099 +4.3%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,644 +6.7%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,770.55 +1.4%        ● Gold: $1,684 per troy ounce +3.5%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 4.16% +0.0        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Technical Take  Recent Moving Average Crossover May Signal Higher Bitcoin Prices This Month  By Glenn Williams Jr  Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range since June, and finding signs of significant movement – up or down – has been challenging. A recently occurring moving average crossover is worth monitoring, however.  On Oct. 28, BTC’s 10-period moving average crossed above its 50-period moving average. BTC’s price dating back to Jan. 1, 2015, shows this trend occurring 27 times over 2,862 trading days.  Following each occurrence, BTC’s price increased by 3% on average for every seven days. BTC prices were about 10% higher on average for 30-day periods following the same signal.  A comparison to all trading data over that period suggests that investors who have gone long BTC following that signal have slightly outperformed a buy-and-hold strategy.

42415466,US6YKYSEulFa8Af9iBB7uS,1667592256,Huobi Exchange Users Furious After GALA Holdings Are Converted to ‘Meme Token’,"Crypto exchange Huobi delisted the GALA/USDT trading pair on Friday after a wrapped version of the token, pGALA, was temporarily rendered worthless after its issuers found a problem with its bridge code.  Huobi users who bought GALA tokens after the incident saw their coins converted to “pGALA,” named for the soon-to-be-retired version of the GALA token trading on Binance Smart Chain.  In an official statement on its website, Huobi referred to its new version pGALA as a “meme token,” noting that it “is not related to the original GALA token.”  Buyers of the mispriced GALA token on Huobi – including several market-making firms – are “pissed” that their GALA tokens have been converted to Huobi’s version of the pGALA token, according to a person familiar with the matter.  “Huobi will delist the GALA/USDT pair at 12:30 (UTC) today and rename GALA as pGALA,” the company said in a statement. Trading of the new pGALA/USDT pair on Huobi was halted as of press time.  In a follow-on announcement, Huobi said it would “convert users' pGALA (former GALA) assets that meet the redeeming conditions to GALA (new GALA) assets at 1:1.” It is unclear, however, how holders of any converted GALA tokens would be able to trade their holdings on Huobi without a GALA trading pair.  Huobi and Gala Games, the company behind the GALA token, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  What happened  Huobi’s announcement came after a puzzling trading snafu on Thursday. After an incident on Thursday caused the GALA token to fall by around 20% on most crypto trading platforms, the price of GALA on Huobi fell much further to nearly zero. Some users bought the heavily discounted tokens in order to take advantage of the apparent arbitrage opportunity.  The reason for the initial price drop stemmed from a confusing maneuver carried out by pNetwork – a firm that locks up GALA on the Ethereum blockchain and re-mints it as “pGALA” on Binance Smart Chain. When pNetwork found a vulnerability in its bridging code, it executed a “white-hat” attack on its own token – minting out billions of new pGALA tokens and using them to drain the decentralized exchanges that allow users to swap between pGALA and other BSC-based tokens. The move effectively allowed pNetwork to assume control of users' funds.  Read More:$1B Crypto Hack Fears Spur 20% GALA Plunge, but Firm Implies It Attacked Itself as a Safeguard  pNetwork’s stated plan is to mint out a new, fixed version of the pGALA token sometime soon. It said it would redistribute those new tokens – along with the funds that it drained from pGALA trading pools – back to users at exactly the same quantities they held before the self-exploit.  In the interim, it encouraged users and exchange platforms to halt trading the buggy, soon-to-be-deprecated pGALA token.  Though some traders and exchange firms took pNetwork’s cue, Huobi apparently continued to accept deposits of the pGALA token.  While it’s unclear exactly how Huobi handled deposits of the pGALA token, one trading firm that spoke with CoinDesk hypothesized that the exchange was accepting BSC-based pGALA as normal GALA – meaning people were able to dump the worthless BSC-based pGALA token onto Huobi and sell it on the main GALA order book.  That would explain why the price of GALA on Huobi dropped so sharply in comparison with other trading platforms – some users may have unknowingly been buying and selling the compromised pGALA token instead of the real thing.  As of press time, GALA tokens were trading at around 4 cents, according to CoinMarketCap.",NEGATIVE,GALA,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | GALA,"Tracy Wang, Sam Kessler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/04/huobi-exchange-users-furious-after-gala-holdings-are-converted-to-meme-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4709b68b1c0a8ca02162c8f6ffcb12e57d5e3d16-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393759,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAmP3,1667591997,"Retract Royalties, Reduce Revenue: NFT Creators Are Suffering and so Are Marketplaces","In late August, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace X2Y2 stopped requiring buyers to pay royalties on the platform. Instead, they would be allowed to elect the percentage they would like to contribute to the artist rather than being forced to pay an amount chosen by the creator. That percentage can be 0 on most purchases.  “Dominant aggregators intend to provide similar functionality in the imminent future” X2Y2 said in a tweet announcing the move to a royalty optional model. “As such, X2Y2 would like to make sure we are ready [and] staying on top of market movements.”  X2Y2 wasn’t far off in its prediction – and may have been the first domino to fall.  In October, Solana-based NFT marketplace Magic Eden said it would adopt a similar model, making creator royalties optional. A representative from Magic Eden told CoinDesk that while the decision to switch to a royalty optional model was difficult, “the collectors’ need for low-fee NFT trades stands in contrast to the creator’s need to receive royalty payments.”  Last week, Ethereum-based platform LooksRare followed in their footsteps, making royalties an optional step at checkout, for those who still wish to pay them. LooksRare said the marketplace would instead distribute 25% of fees the platform collects to creators and collection owners to support creators in the “new landscape.”  As the roster of platforms dropping their royalty requirements continues to grow, it’s sparking heated conversations on the impact on the creator economy that Web3 has fostered.  What are royalties?  In the world of NFTs, royalties are fees that creators earn on secondary sales each time their work changes hands. In the world outside NFTs, you might have heard of musicians earning royalties on people using or playing their music, or that authors earn a percentage of sales of their books as royalties. But traditional artists like painters do not earn royalties from resales. Collectors, not artists, have traditionally reaped the rewards as an artist’s work becomes more popular and valuable.  With NFTs, artists most commonly select a percentage they want buyers to pay in royalties when they first list their NFT for sale.  Les Borsai, co-founder and chief strategy officer of fintech firm Wave Financial told CoinDesk that NFT royalties, which alleviate some of the pain points in the traditional art world that Web3 sought to fix, are now back in the limelight as platforms nix their royalty requirements.  “Artists have never received [payments] from the secondary markets. Platforms taking the royalty model away are taking money out of the artists’ pockets,” said Borsai. “The platforms are asking the artists to trust them, in terms of artist payment allocation. But what is the formula? Where are the checks and balances?”  The move to make royalties optional isn’t just impacting creators. It’s also contributing to sliding trading volume.  According to daily trading volume data from Dune Analytics, from August 26, the date X2Y2 said it would make royalties optional, to today, the volume on X2Y2 has fallen from 11,540 ETH to 547 ETH – or $18,971,298 to $903,304. Dune data also shows LooksRare’s trading volume has fallen from $7,004,141 to $5,447,802.  While Magic Eden’s trading volume fell to a low of 56,556 SOL, or $1,854,471, on October 14, the day Magic Eden said it would go royalty optional, according to data from Dune, it has bucked the downward trend of the other marketplaces abandoning royalties. As of writing, it is at 170,726 SOL, or $5,688,590, a surge that can be credited to a new drop from Y00Ts, showing the power of popular collections to drive trading volume.  These plunges in trading volume may be associated with ETH’s 60% decrease since the beginning of this year, but regardless of ETH’s price there appears to be less interest from buyers on these platforms that have sacrificed their creator contributions.  OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace, has yet to switch to optional royalties – and it might be to their benefit. From September to October, Dune reports that monthly trading volume fell from $348,901,376 to $319,250,807 – much smaller of a loss than these other marketplaces.  Why are platforms eliminating royalty requirements?  NFTs attract buyers ranging from dedicated collectors to fast-moving traders seeking to make a profit. Mashiat Mutmanniah, NFT lead at the layer 1 blockchain Celo, told CoinDesk that the platforms switch on royalties is a move to retain the latter category. Thus the platforms are eliminating the Web3 ethos of “prosperity, equitable ownership and autonomy for fair compensation” that technologies such as NFTs have provided for artists.  “It shifts the focus away from creators, community building and incentivizing co-contributors in pursuit of sales,” said Mutmanniah. “This is backfiring as marketplaces attempt to retain buyers, but they should expect to lose creators and their respective communities.”  While it's likely that more platforms will continue to eliminate royalty requirements, some are bolstering their mission to support creators.  On Wednesday, Solana-based NFT marketplace Exchange.ART said its creating a “Royalties Protection Standard,” to help creators enforce where their assets are listed across platforms that will ensure buyers pay them a percentage for their work.  Originally created as a platform to support fine artists who struggled with galleries taking profits and not having royalties associated with their work, Exchange.ART hopes to build out the infrastructure that will preserve the Web3 ethos being challenged by platforms removing royalties.  Last week, Find Satoshi Lab, known for creating Stepn, created MOOAR, an NFT marketplace that is committed to enforcing creator royalties by enforcing a range of optional payments to the creator between 0.5% and 10%.  However, there are also on-chain implementations to help solve this issue.  Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of the blockchain Pastel Network, told CoinDesk that the company’s product Smart Mint, which allows users to implement royalty standards into the smart contracts of their NFTs, is actively looking for ways to help users understand their royalties and implement them into their tokens.  While he sees the negative impacts that the current market conditions have on these assets, he said this may be a long-term positive thing, with developers advancing technology to prioritize royalties and keep earnings consistent between platforms.  “It should be noted that this move away from royalties has to do with some of the existing technical challenges of managing and enforcing various royalty standards that exist today,” said Georgiades.  As creators continue to see the impacts of platforms dropping royalty requirements, they may take on innovative approaches to attempt to standardize royalties, something that sits at the heart of the Web3 ethos that has fueled the rise of NFTs.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/11/04/retract-royalties-reduce-revenue-nft-creators-are-suffering-and-so-are-marketplaces,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4a6363b257d6a5263b01f811f0ea648ef5f7611-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A recently occurring moving average crossover is worth monitoring, however.  On Oct. 28, BTC’s 10-period moving average crossed above its 50-period moving average. BTC’s price dating back to Jan. 1, 2015 shows this trend occurring 27 times over 2,862 trading days.  Following each occurrence, BTC’s price increased by 3% on average for every seven days. BTC prices were about 10% higher on average for 30-day periods following the same signal.  A comparison to all trading data over that period suggests that investors who have gone long BTC following that signal have slightly outperformed a buy-and-hold strategy.  Whether this holds true for the most recent crossover is uncertain. Friday's prices would need to breach $21,216 to maintain the prior seven-day average. To align with past 30-day performance, prices would need to approach $22,615 by Nov. 28.  The 10/50 moving average crossover has performed in line with the famed golden cross, though there have been far fewer opportunities to do so.  A golden cross occurs when the 50-day moving average for an asset crosses above its 200-day moving average and often indicates a bullish trend in asset prices.  The rationale behind examining a cross of the 10- and 50-day moving averages is simply to identify if a more commonly occurring signal is available.  The graph below shows that the golden cross has occurred just six times since 2015, with average seven- and 30-day gains averaging 4.3% and 9.5%, respectively.  Bitcoin’s declining volatility over the last 12 months is likely working against the signal, however. BTC’s ""average true range"" is 41% lower than the next most recent crossover, and over 70% lower than when the signal occurred in March and in October 2021.  According to Kraken Intelligence’s latest Monthly Market Recap and Outlook report, BTC’s annualized volatility has reached its lowest level for 2022.  Simply put, while the signal is likely positive, the reduced volatility has halted price movement.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/04/recent-moving-average-crossover-may-signal-higher-bitcoin-prices-this-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04f70d4c76b76b55e6202d8c9f449637a9048a04-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC is charging Douver Torres Braga, Joff Paradise, Keleionalani Akana Taylor and Jonathan Tetreault for their involvement in Trade Coin Club, which raised over 80,000 bitcoin (BTC) from over 100,000 investors.  Braga, who founded the firm, allegedly deceived investors by telling them they could generate daily returns of 0.35% on their crypto through a bot, but instead used these funds to compensate himself, Paradise, Taylor and Tetreault.  “We allege that Braga used Trade Coin Club to steal hundreds of millions from investors around the world and enrich himself by exploiting their interest in investing in digital assets,” said the chief of the Enforcement Division’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, David Hirsch, in a statement.

The relevant indicator here is the &apos;UTXO value bands,&apos; which tells us what percentage of the total Bitcoin supply is held by which groups. The value bands or groups here are divided based on the number of coins in each Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO), or simply, the amount currently held in each wallet. For example, the 1k-10k BTC value band includes all wallets that are currently holding between 1k and 10k BTC.

Perhaps, said John Todaro, vice president at investment and asset management firm Needham & Co., on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program Friday.  However, the analyst is more sure that Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, the second-largest by volume in the world and one of the companies behind the stablecoin (with Circle), will benefit from USDC’s growth.  Read more: Coinbase Cuts Q3 Losses in Half, Sees Crypto Headwinds Continuing Into 2023  “USDC is exciting [in the] long term,” Todaro said. “We’re excited about stablecoins.”  The analyst, whose focus is on crypto assets and blockchain research, told CoinDesk TV that considering the slow pace of development for a U.S. CBDC it is “debatable” whether “private markets” will ever choose to use one. But a stablecoin like USDC, which is pegged 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, is another matter.  Read more: What Is a CBDC?  Todaro explained that if Coinbase were to “mint” USDC, it would be entitled to the “revenue share on the back of the reserve assets,” which in turn would mean Coinbase would operate like a more traditional finance firm.  “If you see USDC’s circulating supply continue to grow, and Coinbase accounts are involved with minting USDC,” said Tardano, “as [interest] rates and those reserve assets continue to rise the interest income on that is going to increase.”  Though the crypto exchange’s actual revenue inched just above $590 million, missing Needham & Co.’s $603 million estimate and down from the second quarter’s top line of $803 million, Todaro said it wasn’t “necessarily an awful quarter” for Coinbase.

42413279,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8HqI,1667584590,Crypto Exchange Coinbase Draws Mixed Reaction on Wall Street After Weak Q3,"Crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) missed earnings estimates for the third quarter as trading volume fell 71% from the fourth quarter of 2021, but interest income from its exposure to the USDC stablecoin was a bright spot.  The reaction on Wall Street was mixed, although Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau, for one, is bullish.  “We believe the visibility of COIN generating positive adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in 2023 has increased, and its ability to diversify and generate non-trading revenue is still underappreciated,” Lau wrote in a research note to clients. Lau continued with an outperform rating on Coinbase's shares and a $107 price target, or nearly double the current price of $57.  Others on Wall Street, though, continue to question Coinbase’s path to profitability.  “With the decline in trading volume, it looks like it will take longer to get to EBITDA-positive, as Coinbase continues to invest in building out new products and services, in part supporting the growth of the crypto ecosystem,” JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington said in a note to clients. JPMorgan has a neutral rating and $66 price target on the stock.  Josepth Vafi, director of equity research at Canaccord Genuity, was bit more constructive, telling clients Coinbase is ""finding the right happy medium"" with its realization that the cost structure needs to be managed as breakneck growth is in the past. ""A steady cost lane may be the right balance for achieving a steady goal of growing competitively but efficiently.""  The numbers  Late Thursday, the company reported third-quarter revenue of $576 million, down from $803 million in the second quarter and from $1.24 billion in last year's third quarter. It lost $116 million on an Ebitda basis in the latest quarter, compared with a loss of $151 million in the second quarter and a profit of $618 million a year ago.  Trading volume fell to $159 billion from $217 billion in the second quarter and from $547 billion last year's fourth quarter.  Subscription revenue, however, rose to $211 million from $147 million three months earlier. The largest contributor to that jump was interest income – which flowed through to Coinbase thanks to its exposure to USD coin (USDC)bas well as interest earned on customer fiat deposits.  Coinbase didn't offer new estimates for next year, but said it is “preparing with a conservative bias and assuming that the current macroeconomic headwinds will persist and possibly intensify.”  Read more:Coinbase Cuts Q3 Losses in Half, Sees Crypto Headwinds Continuing Into 2023",NEUTRAL,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH | USDC,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/04/coinbases-weak-third-quarter-may-not-be-the-bottom-wall-street,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a441548a7eef6feb3d6c58c74d793d9032a0f551-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394120,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXmmt,1667581277,Don’t Mistake Tech Layoffs for a Recession,"Two seemingly contradictory pieces of news landed Friday morning, each weird and debatably unpleasant in its own special way.  On the one hand, we got news that Twitter, now owned by a visibly flailing Elon Musk, has threatened a round of layoffs that could cut as much as 50% of the social platform’s staff.  On the other, we got a jobs report that dramatically outperformed Wall Street projections. Economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal predicted that an average of 205,000 jobs would be added this quarter. Instead we got 261,000 new jobs, blowing out expectations even as unemployment rose by a hair to 3.7%.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The pair of items are a reminder of the deep disconnection between the tech sector and the rest of the economy. The Musk/Twitter situation is very unique and hilarious. But it’s also a typically Muskian exaggeration of the wider forces driving tech, at least for the moment, in the opposite direction of the rest of the U.S. economy.  Elon Musk is laying off half of Twitter staff because he bumbled and trapped himself into buying a pig in a poke. In April he made an unsolicited offer of $44.20 per share for the company. That looked vaguely like a good deal at the time because Twitter, along with every other “tech” or “stay at home” stock, saw an absurd and clearly unsustainable run-up in equity prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, because (never forget) equity investors as a whole are a bunch of lemmings.  See also: Reading Elon’s Tea Leaves / Opinion  Musk is apparently not any smarter than those lemmings, or at least not any better at controlling his emotions. That $44 billion is 20%-25% above the market cap Twitter had pre-pandemic, and Musk now has to finance a $13 billion mountain of debt that may well outpace Twitter’s own inconsistent and mediocre profit stream. This is, with little exaggeration, the equivalent of buying Peloton for $44 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 because you thought people would continue buying overpriced stationary bikes forever.  That’s why Musk’s both throwing crew off the Twitter ship at a pace likely to destabilize operations, and floating revenue-focused ideas, like charging for verification, that seem to reflect a profound misunderstanding of how the platform works. Personally, things are already so unhinged I’m ready to predict that Twitter under Musk crashes and burns, forcing a fire sale and/or a fresh public offering that leaves Musk personally in the hole for billions of dollars.  But as much as this is peak Elon Musk clownish nonsense, it is also the story, in microcosm, of the larger tech sector. For roughly a decade, “tech” (formal definition: any company that can convince a venture capitalist that it is “tech”) has run substantially on debt. Financial debt, yes, eased by a zero interest rate era that is now coming to a violent close.  See also: Time to Decide: Are You an Investor or a Gambler? | Opinion  But tech has also run on a more conceptual sort of debt, underwritten by forward-looking promises priced into the equity even of profitable operations like Amazon, Google, and Facebook/Meta. Meta in particular, with its stock down an aneurysm-inducing 70% since January, is showing what happens when the future becomes the present and you haven’t risen to meet it.  Yet, it’s all happening at the same time as workers and companies in the rest of the economy are, if not entirely thriving, certainly healthy. Inflation is a serious looming worry – but it’s also deeply tied to this meta-economic rotation. The influx of cash that helped so many Americans during the pandemic is at least one factor in both current inflation and jobs strength. That cash plus the ensuing inflation is also likely driving a shift of wealth from the types of people who invest in venture-backed startups to the type of people who “invest” in food, cars, sneakers, gasoline and health care – categories among the top equity gainers right now.  The past decade in tech has given rise to not just holy fools like Elon Musk but to outright swindlers like Elizabeth Holmes and Adam Neumann (who both, notably, pitched their non-tech companies under tech banners). Maybe a little harsh discipline isn’t such a bad thing – especially if the trade-off is more jobs for the rest of us.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET,David Z.

42394110,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXm2j,1667577000,At Stake in the US Midterms: The Future of Money,"With abortion, voting rights and other weighty issues top of mind, “normies” could perhaps be forgiven for dismissing as self-obsessive any crypto commentator’s claim that Tuesday’s midterm U.S. elections are monumentally important for how they’ll shape the regulation of blockchain technology and digital assets.  Regardless, that’s where I’m going with this. All of us – not just crypto natives – have a great deal at stake in how the next Congress enacts new crypto laws.  Of the five federal electoral cycles that this industry has now been through – I count the first as the 2014 midterms, which coincided with a debate spurred by the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) initial 2013 guidance on regulating “virtual currencies” – this one matters the most. That’s not just because crypto exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) developers and non-fungible token (NFT) platforms and issuers have their profitability riding on some key regulatory bills. It’s because they could define the future of money.  Whether we like it or not, money is going digital – truly digital, not Zelle- or Venmo-on-banking digital – which means the age-old system through which human beings generate, record and exchange value is about to undergo radical change. It’s vitally important for all of us that the laws that define how that change evolves are drafted and deliberated over in an open way so that, once enacted, they take humanity’s best interests into account.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  So, with that lofty stage-setter out of the way, let’s look at two equally impactful bills under consideration.  Until a few months back, progress on both was generating hope that the crypto industry would this year enter a new age of regulatory clarity. In the end, political divisions over core issues, as well as the distractions of other priorities on Capitol Hill, pushed them beyond the post-election “lame duck” period to make them the next Congress’ responsibility.  That means that next week’s vote, which will determine who gets to define the leadership and makeup of the committees overseeing these bills, will indirectly shape their course – and, by extension, the future of money.  Read more: Previewing Next Week's US Midterm Election  The DCCPA  The first is the Senate Agriculture Committee’s Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA). Given the losses people suffered with the collapse of crypto lending platforms such as Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, the bill’s intent seems reasonable: It would impose greater accountability on such providers and set strict rules for protecting customers’ assets.  Also, the DCCPA explicitly defines crypto tokens as “digital commodities,” which puts the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the primary oversight spot. That’s consistent with what many critics of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s hardline approach to the industry have been pushing for.  But, as always, the devil is in the details. Many are concerned that the sweeping requirements, laid out in an initial one-pager, that “all digital commodity platforms register with the CFTC,” could render DeFi operations unworkable.  A draft of the bill shows a recent amendment adding an exemption for any person who “develops or publishes software” from the bill’s covered category of “digital commodity broker.” While that’s a relief for crypto developers, concerns still exist that overly vague wording could leave some key DeFi operators liable and so suffocate DeFi’s entire open-access, decentralized software-driven ecosystem of interconnected, composable protocols.  Why does this matter to the average voter? Because, as the Cato Institute’s Jennifer Schulp and Jack Solowey argue, this open, composable structure of DeFi is necessary to remove the “intermediary risk” of traditional finance – the very issue at the heart of the collapse of centralized (CeFi) custodians Voyager and Celsius that the bill intends to address.  Also, as Schulp and Solowey point out, in obviating the need for intermediating authorities, DeFi creates a “permissionless” environment for developers to innovate around smart contract- and collateral-based models that can expand financial access for people and businesses excluded from the traditional system. If you insert licensing rules and a regulating authority into that system, much of that powerful “permissionlessness” could disappear.  Read more: DeFi Must Be Defended  One of many examples of valuable innovation that could be stymied if licensing rules are too sweeping: the social impact-focused DeFi projects now blossoming across sub-Saharan Africa, which we discussed last year in a Money Reimagined podcast episode with two Nigerian entrepreneurs.  Beyond Africa, it’s in all our interests to cultivate a more decentralized system where the interest rates, service fees and insurance premiums that factor into the cost of everything aren’t set by a regulation-privileged oligopoly of financial middlemen. In the U.S. alone, the financial service sector’s revenues – the price that banks and other institutions charge us for their intermediation – ran to $4.85 trillion in 2021, or 7.4% of GDP.  Stablecoin legislation  Then there’s the House’s work-in-progress stablecoin bill, which Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), one the lead proponents, described as “a pretty ugly baby” on account of all the competing matters that opposing lawmakers have tried to reconcile.  One such issue is the question of which federal agency should regulate stablecoin issuers. As currently designed, the proposal appears to fall short of demanding that stablecoin issuance be limited to regulated banks and instead would subject non-bank issuers to strict regulation by either the Federal Reserve or some other special purpose watchdog. The distinction matters because it could dictate whether stablecoin issuers gain access to federal backing such as the Fed’s lending facilities or deposit coverage from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Depending on how it lands, the wording on this agency/financial backstop matter could have huge positive or negative ramifications for competing U.S. stablecoin issuers. These include Circle, which does not currently have a banking license; Paxos, which has a federal trust charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; and Custodia Bank, which is licensed under Wyoming’s digital asset banking regulation.  Read more: Will Stablecoins Be Tethered to the Fed? Lawmakers Have Circled That Option  The debate over whether the Fed should steer the process also bleeds into the big question of whether it should pursue its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) in parallel with, or instead of, stablecoins. That question opens up others on the kind of privacy people can expect when they transact in digital dollars and how fluidly those dollars can flow into and out of foreign jurisdictions.  Backers of a private sector-driven stablecoin model, in which blockchain-based dollar tokens can move peer-to-peer between wallets anywhere in the world, rightly portray it as a way to provide financial inclusion to everyone and to spur global innovation around money. It’s an appealing counterpoint to the idea of a centrally managed and monitored CBDC, such as China’s, which crypto advocates describe as the makings of a totalitarian dystopia.  But as I’ve discussed elsewhere, a regulatory green light for stablecoins could also result in a world awash with dollars, undermining the monetary sovereignty of other nations in ways that could become politically contentious. Moreover, if that model were to allow a private company like Circle to exploit network effects that turn it into, say, the Google or Facebook of money, we may have a different, private sector version of the same Big Brother problem.  Done right, regulation of both these areas could address such risks and create the right balance between innovation, customer protection, competition and geopolitical stability. Done wrong, legislators could do a great deal of harm.  So, yes, the crypto impact of next week’s election matters – to everyone.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

At first, the new service will be available to a few thousand users, Andres Rodriguez Ledermann, vice president of Wealth Management at Uala, told CoinDesk, but it will be rolled out to all of the company’s 4.5 million Argentine customers in coming weeks.  The platform only allows for purchases and sales of the cryptos – withdrawals are not available. The minimum transaction size is 250 pesos ($0.83).  Rodriguez Ledermann did not rule out the company offering crypto trading in Mexico and Colombia, where it also operates, but added that there are regulatory matters that need to be studied.  Uala is the first financial player to launch crypto trading in Argentina since the local central bank in May barred two banks from allowing its customers access to cryptocurrencies.  In order to comply with current regulations in Argentina, said Rodriguez Ledermann, Uala created a special company to provide its crypto service – Uanex, which is based in England and has the Latin American crypto company Bitso as its crypto liquidity provider.  In August, Uala raised a $350 million Series D funding round co-led by SoftBank and Tencent’ affiliates. The investment gave the company a post-money valuation of $2.45 billion.

42413892,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAlsSF,1667574000,"Goodbye, CoinDesk 20 – Hello, CoinDesk Market Index","Editor's note: In January 2024, CoinDesk Indices introduced a new benchmark called the CoinDesk 20 Index. It is not the same as the discontinued index described in the following story, which was originally published in 2022.  All good things must come to an end, but in the case of the CoinDesk 20 – our list of the most relevant assets in the crypto markets – the end means a passing of the baton to something better and new: the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) family, a group of indices that serve as a benchmark for cryptocurrencies and the spiritual successor to the CD20.  When we launched the CoinDesk 20 in the summer of 2020, the goal was to identify the assets that matter most to the market. At the time, bitcoin and ether were together the lion’s share of the market (they still are), and alternative coins flooded the market but only a few stood out. The CoinDesk 20 captured the 20 most important digital assets in the market based on a formula that weeded out flash-in-the-pan tokens and best represented what most of the market was looking at. Regularly, the CoinDesk 20’s total market cap was well above 90% of the overall market.  Today, it’s a different world. More networks are showing they can provide viable cryptocurrencies, and specialization is becoming more apparent.  On our end, CoinDesk also has more resources and technological capabilities than it did when launched the CoinDesk 20, thanks in large part to our acquisition of what is now CoinDesk Indices. Now we can provide incredible amounts of data and calculations to measure how the market is doing, and boil them down to a specific number: the CMI, an index of the most important coins out there, weighted by market capitalization.  What’s more, CoinDesk Indices has also developed one of the most important projects out there for crypto asset managers: the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). The DACS classifies 500 of the biggest cryptocurrencies into a three-tiered hierarchy of six sectors, 23 industry groups and 36 industries. Those six sectors are currency, smart contract platforms, decentralized finance, culture and entertainment, and computing and digitization.  The CoinDesk 20 was a useful, informative tool for those following cryptocurrency markets, but with the advent of the CMI and the DACS CoinDesk now provides better, more robust ways to help everyone from crypto whales to crypto novices get a handle on the markets.  This is just one of the many ways CoinDesk constantly iterates and improves what we offer the markets as this latest financial revolution takes shape.

At a first glance, the company&apos;s Q3 numbers were poor as its earnings and revenue fell short of consensus estimates and dropped from the year-ago quarter, driven by lower trading volume in the face of depressed token prices and deteriorating macroeconomic conditions.

S&amp;S sales rose to $210.51M at September 30 from $145.08M at Sept. 30, 2021. Another bright spot was its lower adjusted EBITDA loss of $115.9M versus -$151.1M in the second quarter.

42415471,US6YKYSEulFa8Af9iBB7yK,1667570400,"CBDCs Could Reduce FX Transaction Speeds to 10 Seconds, NY Fed Says","Foreign exchange transactions could drop from a two-day process to less than 10 seconds if central bank digital currencies (CBDC) were involved, according to an experiment conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Project Cedar, a research effort launched by the N.Y. Fed’s New York Innovation Center (NYIC), tested the speed of FX transactions using distributed ledgers, finding that in a simulated example, they could lower the speeds of transactions with multiple participants and observers. The project intended to research the benefits of wholesale CBDCs, according to a brief report published Friday.  Each participant operated its own version of the ledger, rather than having the participants act as nodes in a single distributed ledger, the report said. Nevertheless, the participants were able to settle both sides of transactions simultaneously, finding a massive speed boost compared to the current system. While the report detailed some of the technical aspects of the test – it used an undisclosed permissioned blockchain network and was written in the Rust programming language – it did not provide many details about how the simulation was conducted or how they confirmed transaction settlements.  This first phase saw each participant run “homogenous” ledgers, but future tests will see participants running different networks to test for cross-chain compatibility.  The Federal Reserve has been grappling with the question of whether it can or should issue a CBDC for years. While the Biden administration has indicated that the Fed should do so if it’s in the ""national interest,"" and various Fed branches – including Boston’s – have been conducting research, Fed officials have indicated they’ll wait for Congress to authorize a digital dollar before moving forward. This week’s report said it’s not meant to push for a particular outcome.  In a speech discussing the latest research, Michelle Neal, the head of the markets group at the N.Y. Fed, said the central bank branch wanted to test the technology from its own perspective to see if it could address concerns about risk and scalability.  “This indicates that a modular ecosystem of ledgers has the potential for continued scalability, and that distributed ledger technology could enable settlement times well below the current industry standard of two days, with the added guarantee of atomic settlement,” she said.

NFT's have garnered attention from celebrity endorsements, while the popularity of the virtual world that allows people to buy and sell these tokens, the metaverse, only pumped their value. By the end of March 2021 global NFT sales topped $17 billion according to a statement. Though, weekly NFT sales have since fallen more than 90% from August 2021 to March 2022, it added.  Now U.K. members of Parliament are afraid that NFT speculation may be a ""bubble."" An example the committee raised was the NFT of Jack Dorsey’s first tweet that initially sold for $2.9 million but when it was re-listed at auction the highest bid was $280.  “Now that the market is veering wildly, and there are fears that the bubble may burst, we need to understand the risks, benefits, and regulatory requirements of this groundbreaking technology,"" chair of the DCMS Committee, Julian Knight, MP, said in the statement.  The U.K. is forging ahead with its plans to regulate the crypto sector. It recently added amendments that would recognize crypto as a regulated activity and would ensure that the ads of firms which are not fully authorized to operate in the country can be restricted.  The deadline for the inquiry is Jan. 6.  The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee was not available for comment when contacted by CoinDesk.

42415452,US6YKYSEulFa8Af9iBB7TM,1667568448,Crypto Firm Arca Closed Its Terra-Exposed Digital Yield Fund,"Crypto hedge fund Arca shuttered its Digital Yield Fund less than a year after its launch due to the broader market downturn, a person close to the firm told CoinDesk. The fund had slightly over $20 million in assets under management at the time of its closure, and the capital was returned to investors, according to the person.  “After a strategic business review, we have decided to close our Digital Yield Fund which took effect Aug. 31,” Arca CEO Rayne Steinberg confirmed in an email to CoinDesk. “Given changing market conditions, we believe that this decision was in the best interest of our investors.”  Arca announced the actively-managed Digital Yield Fund in September 2021 and targeted effective yields in the low double digits. The fund had a gross asset value of $53 million as of June 30, according to the firm’s annual Investment Adviser registration documents.  In an investor letter sent out in May, Arca revealed that the fund had exposure to Terra’s collapsed terraUSD (UST) stablecoin. The exposure didn’t force the closure, said the source, but was rather an example of the market turbulence that shifted Digital Yield’s risk-reward balance. Arca remains open to launching a similar product in the future, according to the source.  Arca manages three other funds. The flagship Digital Assets vehicle invests in the tokens of crypto companies and nearly doubled its sales to investors year-over-year to $191.7 million, according to a regulatory filing last week. The venture capital-focused Arca Endeavor and a non-fungible token (NFT) fund had gross asset values of $10 million and $24.4 million, respectively, at the end of June.

Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) was higher despite a U.S. jobs report showing faster-than-expected growth in October – implying the Federal Reserve might have to stay aggressive in pushing to cool off the labor market.  Fidelity Investments has opened the waiting list for Fidelity Crypto, which will offer commission-free bitcoin and ether trading for retail users. Fidelity already offers crypto investing to institutional clients and previously issued a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Canada and has several crypto ETFs in the U.S., although spot-bitcoin ETFs are yet to be approved in the U.S.  Twitter has halted its plans to build a crypto wallet, and, on cue, the price of dogecoin sank more than 10% following the announcement. The cancellation is part of a new roadmap being aggressively implemented by Twitter’s new owner, Elon Musk. The wallet is reportedly meant to enable users to deposit and withdraw their funds without relying on third-party services.  Chaos ensnared Gala Games late Thursday, as fears of a potentially billion-dollar hack – or maybe a rug pull – drove its native GALA token down 20%, while a firm apparently related to the crypto play-to-earn platform said that they had actually effectively attacked themselves to prevent bad actors from absconding with users' money.  Chart of the Day: The Meta Effect  AR, the native token of the decentralized storage protocol Arweave, surged over 40% the past 48 hours thanks to Meta's decision to utilize the Web3 platform to archive Instagram creators' digital collectibles.  The above chart shows open interest or the total dollar amount locked in futures tied to AR, which blew up 190% to $40 million in two days, indicating an influx of new money into the market.  An increase in open interest, along with an increase in the underlying asset's price, is a strong indicator of a bullish trend.  – Omkar Godbole     Trending Posts  Aptos CEO Defends 'Fair' Tokenomics That Prompted Community Backlash  Circle Begins Putting Reserves Into New BlackRock Fund  Singapore Approves In-Principle License for Crypto Fund Manager Hashkey  CoinDesk Market Index  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Mask Network MASK  +19.6% Computing Gitcoin GTC  +14.01% Currency Gala GALA  +11.36% Culture & Entertainment  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Band Protocol BAND  -45.6% Computing Loopring LRC  -26.7% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC  -17.87% Smart Contract Platform  Sector classifications are provided via the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), developed by CoinDesk Indices to provide a reliable, comprehensive and standardized classification system for digital assets.

42415458,US6YKYSEulFa8Af9iBB7ey,1667565287,"US Added 261K Jobs in October, Topping Expectations for 200K","The U.S. economy added 261,000 jobs in October, beating economist forecasts for 200,000. The unemployment rate rose to 3.7% versus expectations for 3.6%  After an initial dip of about $200, bitcoin (BTC) has bounced to its pre-report level, currently trading at $20,700. While the headline 261,000 jobs growth suggests the U.S. Federal Reserve has plenty more to do to battle inflation, at least one economist – Dartmouth Professor Danny Blanchflower – takes note of the rising unemployment rate and a sizable decline in the household survey of 325,000 jobs. ""We are now in a position ... to expect the Fed to go into full reverse gear as the labor market is set to crash,"" he tweeted. ""Rate cuts are coming,"" he added.  Checking two metrics of particular concern for the Fed, average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in October versus expectations for 0.3%, suggesting a continuation of inflationary pressures. And the labor force participation rate – which the Fed would like to see rise as that might put a damper on wage growth – ticked down to 62.2%.  “Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this week.  On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided on a fourth consecutive 75 basis point interest rate increase in its continued effort to slow inflation by slowing the economy.  However, both in its meeting statement and in Powell's post-meeting press conference, the Fed indicated it's mulling a slower pace of rate hikes, perhaps starting as soon the December FOMC meeting.  Powell on Wednesday said he's more concerned with how high interest rates need to go rather than the pace of tightening, a shift from previously where talked about the Fed’s approach of “front-loading,” meaning that rates need to go higher faster.  “While more hikes are on the way they are likely to be smaller from now on,” said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. “That said, there is nothing in there to suggest any desire to pivot to rate cuts later in 2023 – rates are more likely to be on hold through the rest of next year.“",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/04/october-payroll-report-showed-slowdown-in-job-vacancies-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/141f1f99c0d71e1adf83dae53fae8482f9a3a360-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

3721688,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=509331,1667563860,Polygon (MATIC) Price Rallies As Whales Supply The Fuel,"Polygon (MATIC) is one of the biggest winners in the crypto market today, with a 15% price increase over the last 24 hours. As NewsBTC reported yesterday, MATIC gave a golden cross signal on the daily chart a few days ago. The last time MATICUSD posted this significant trading signal on the daily chart, the altcoin recorded a massive rally of more than 13,000%. Related Reading: MATIC On The Move After Polygon Tapped By META | MATICUSD November 3, 2022 MATIC had been trading in a sideways channel since mid-July. After the golden cross formed on October 20, MATIC showed small strength. However, the explosive breakout from the sideways channel was triggered by fundamentals and probably whales scooping up MATIC. After the announcement that META will use Polygon for Instagram NFTs, the price soared by more than 20% within one day and was able to overcome the 4-month high at $1.06. Unsurprisingly, after Polygon&apos;s explosive move (MATIC), the RSI is currently at 75 and thus in the overbought zone. A retest of the $1.06 level would thus be healthy for the market before the rally may find a continuation.

42393769,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAnEL,1667556950,"Proposed UK Rules Will Make Advertising Crypto a Lot Harder, Industry Warns","The U.K. could make it difficult for crypto companies to advertise to clients within its borders if a new proposed bill is passed into law.  On Thursday, lawmakers on the committee for the Financial Services and Markets (FSM) bill – which could also end up legally recognizing crypto as financial instruments – approved an amendment to a markets bill to regulate crypto ads and promotions.  However, crypto advocates feel the rule may be too restrictive for a country that said it wants to support the digital asset industry.  They worry crypto firms would have to jump through many hoops when trying to advertise to local customers, facing high costs from having to rely on an authorized entity to approve adverts.  In January, the U.K. Treasury, the government's finance arm, said it planned to strengthen the rules governing crypto ads to improve consumer protection. The Treasury wants this measure in place to stop dangerous and fraudulent entities from reaching out to local customers.  An amendment, which was accepted unanimously by committee lawmakers during Thursday’s reading of the bill, hopes to make crypto firms comply with the country's financial promotions rules. These rules would require any type of advertisement or invitation to the public to engage in an investment activity targeting consumers to be approved by an authorized entity, according to industry representatives.  Even an advertisement that says “click here to exchange your assets” or “click here to start trading” is not allowed without approval from someone who is authorized, Diego Ballon Ossio, senior associate at London-based Clifford Chance, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Crypto services are not recognized as regulated activities in the country, which means it would be almost impossible for these companies to approve their own ads.  Read more: Bitcoin Exchanges Flood London's Metro With Adverts  At present, a person or group from a company or a legal corporation can be designated as authorized entities for approving promotions. Authorized firms can also approve ads on behalf of other companies.  In 2019, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) sent a warning letter to authorized approvers to make sure ads by unauthorized entities meet local regulatory standards before greenlighting them. The regulator has since said it wants to strengthen its rules to ensure that the firms which approve promotions have the relevant expertise to do so by February 2023.  Currently, “no crypto firm is an authorized firm … so they can’t approve their advert,” said Mark Aruliah, senior policy adviser at Elliptic at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit in October.  Because crypto is not recognized as a regulated activity right now, service providers don’t exactly have a means of getting authorized as an ad approver either.  That means crypto firms would have to jump through more hoops and face more costs when trying to advertise to local customers because they’d have to rely on an authorized entity to approve their ads.  FCA registration not enough  In the U.K., crypto firms have to go through a complex process to register with the FCA, which oversees anti-money laundering compliance. The FCA registration allows crypto companies to serve clients in the U.K. but it does not give firms the go-ahead to authorize their own advertisements, Ossio said.  “If somebody [a crypto firm] has gone through the very harsh process of getting registered, then they would still not be able to make financial promotions,” Ossio said.  Read more: UK Financial Regulator to Limit Crypto Ads to Sophisticated, Wealthy Investors  The only exception is if firms have, for example, authorization for trading derivatives and just happen to also serve crypto, these companies can approve their own adverts, Ossio explained.  In a Parliamentary debate last month City Minister Andrew Griffith, who proposed the amendment to his own bill, did reassure participants that the Treasury “will consult on its approach with industry and stakeholders ahead of using the powers, to ensure that the framework reflects the unique features, benefits and risks posed by crypto activities.” This consultation is set to occur in the coming weeks.  Approving promotions  If the new rule is passed into law without any changes, traditional financial firms would still be able to sign off on their own advertisements, but crypto firms will likely be at the mercy of authorized persons who don’t work for those firms. People who approve promotions will also have to check they are fair, clear and not misleading, said James Alleyne, a legal director at Kingsley Napley LLP, in a statement.  This can be costly, according to Ian Taylor, executive director of the lobby group CryptoUK.  Crypto firms could turn to lawyers to authorize their ads but “if something goes wrong, and then somebody sues because the advert isn't clear, there is a high risk premium attached to that,” Taylor said. “So they're going to charge a lot of money to crypto businesses to sign off on their advert. We don't even know if there's an appetite to do that.“  Those who are not in crypto might also lack the necessary industry knowledge to know what they can and cannot approve, Ossio said.  “And so, a registered crypto asset services business may have a problem which is that you could not publish financial promotions at all, and be restricted,” Ossio said.  Crypto hub  The Conservative government, now led by seemingly crypto-friendly Rishi Sunak, has said several times that it wants to make the country a hub for digital assets.  The local crypto community is calling for changes to this measure to ensure the U.K. remains competitive in the sector. One suggestion is to extend the rule to foreign companies looking to enter the market. Currently, firms not registered in the U.K. can reach out to serve clients based there because there are no rules to stop them from doing so.  “My hope is that ... the restriction of financial promotions comes in so then overseas persons can't come in until they have somebody like a lawyer to prove it. So investors in the U.K. are kept safe,” said Aruliah of Elliptic.  U.K. crypto firms should be able to approve their own adverts, otherwise, there is no real incentive to be in the country over other jurisdictions like the European Union, Aruliah said.  The EU recently finalized markets in crypto assets legislation – its wide ranging bill on crypto, which has a heavy focus on stablecoins.  Though the U.K. government has said that it wants to be a crypto hub, the FCA has admitted it had a more critical view of crypto in the past. Should lawmakers give the FCA greater authorities through its FSM bill, what happens to crypto companies will depend on this more skeptical regulator. The FCA has already said it plans on publishing the final rules on the promotion of relevant crypto assets once it gets these powers, it said in August.  “These rules are likely to follow the same approach as those for other high-risk investments,” the FCA said in August. “Crypto remains high risk so people need to be prepared to lose all their money if they choose to invest in crypto assets.”  CryptoUK has been proposing solutions to the Treasury to ensure U.K. crypto firms are not disadvantaged by the promotions amendment.  “So where we're focused on is [telling] Treasury you need to change this authorized persons regime to perhaps include firms that have an e-money license or are on the money laundering regime,” CryptoUK’s Taylor said.  The FSM bill is still being debated in parliament.

42413692,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBqVk,1667556406,"MATIC Rally Gathers Speed as Meta Announces Polygon-Powered NFTs, Chart Signals Golden Cross","The advance in scaling system Polygon's native cryptocurrency MATIC has accelerated in the wake of positive news and bullish chart patterns.  MATIC has rallied 30% in two days, reaching a six-month high of $1.15 on Friday, according to CoinDesk data. The climb has lifted the cryptocurrency's cumulative gain since the end of June to 270%.  The latest leg higher could be attributed to Web2 giant Meta's decision to launch a toolkit allowing users of social media platform Instagram to mint and sell Polygon-powered non-fungible tokens (NFT), or digital collectibles. Polygon is the first partner that Meta has chosen for the new feature.  ""Creators will soon be able to make their own digital collectibles on Instagram and sell them to fans, both on and off Instagram,"" Meta announced Wednesday. ""They’ll have an end-to-end toolkit – from creation (starting on the Polygon blockchain) and showcasing to selling.""  On the same day, investment banking giant JPMorgan successfully executed its first decentralized finance trade over Polygon.  MATIC's rally since then suggests that despite lingering concerns about the global economy, investors are ready to snap up coins with positive fundamental developments that promise increased use cases.  The investor preference for news-driven trading is also evident from Thursday's 60% surge in AR, the native coin of the decentralized storage system Arweave after Meta said it would utilize the Web3 platform to archive digital collectibles.  According to Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, MATIC's rally could have legs.  ""Polygon's MATIC could be a core long position here as Meta (Facebook) is serious about luring TikTok influencers away and becoming more active on its Instagram platform,"" Thielen said. ""Pledging to take zero commission on sales – contrary to Apple's 30% cut on all NFT sales on the App store – is a key selling point.""  Meta said it won't charge fees to create or sell NFTs until 2024. However, 30% sales deductions will be applicable for the store fees. A core long position refers to a primary long-term bet that satisfies both fundamental and technical research criteria.  ""The Meta announcement has brought attention to MATIC and [AR], and traders seem to be pairing long positions in these coins with short [sell] positions in perpetual futures tied to bitcoin,"" said Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds.  ""Taking U.S. dollar exposure out of the trade seems to be the best thing to do right now,"" he said, drawing attention to the surging MATIC-BTC ratio, which has jumped to the highest point since January on Binance.  Golden crossover  The MATIC/USD daily price chart shows the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) has crossed above the 200-day SMA, confirming what chart analysts call a golden crossover.  The pattern indicates the recent average price is higher than the long-term average price, a positive signal indicating the progression of an uptrend.  MATIC has toppled resistance at $1.055 (the Aug. 14 high), having breached a downtrend line last month. The next resistance is lined up at $1.24, the Feb. 24 low.  Open interest jumps  The dollar amount locked in futures tied to MATIC, also known as open interest, has nearly doubled from $209 million to $415 million in 24 hours, according to data source coinglass.com.  An increased open interest implies an influx of new money into the market. An uptick in open interest, along with an increase in the price of an underlying asset, is said to confirm an uptrend.

42413282,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8Ht6,1667553982,Aptos CEO Defends 'Fair' Tokenomics That Prompted Community Backlash,"The CEO of Aptos, the layer 1 blockchain that went live last month, has defended the project's ""fair"" token allocation following a wave of criticism from its community.  Aptos airdropped its APT token to early network testers in October, but concerns surfaced immediately over the distribution of tokens when core contributors, investors and the Aptos Foundation received almost half the 1 billion tokens issued. This led to concerns that investors and the foundation could potentially liquidate their tokens, which would trigger a negative market reaction.  ""Our goal when we designed the tokenomics was to create something that fairly represents the community,"" Aptos CEO Mo Shaikh told CoinDesk in an interview. ""If you look at our tokenomics distribution, we have among the lowest across any blockchain for investors. ... It's among the most fair that we have seen even compared to other projects.""  Ethereum allocated just 9.9% of its supply to the founding team and another 9.9% to the Ethereum Foundation.  Aptos, which is made up of former Meta employees who previously worked on the diem stablecoin project, raised $200 million in March followed by a $150 million Series A round in July, with participation from the likes of FTX Ventures and Jump Crypto.  The Aptos token (APT) is currently trading at $7.39 with a market cap just shy of $1 billion.  ""There are also pretty strong lockup periods. If someone wants to dig a bit deeper they would realize that investors can't dump on retail, they are totally blocked from doing that,"" Shaikh said. ""We've put a lot of constraints on investors that no one has ever done before.""  Technical constraints  Last month's launch of the Aptos blockchain was chaotic. Speculation mounted over whether the airdrop was exploited by attackers who reportedly created numerous Aptos wallets to capitalize on a lack of security barriers and receive a disproportionate share of an airdrop in what's known as a Sybil attack.  ""It's a difficult challenge to fairly reward those who have contributed to the ecosystem,"" said Chief Technology Officer Avery Ching. ""What you're trying to do is identify unique individuals, and that is a very challenging problem in general. We've taken a tremendous amount of care to ensure that every recipient was unique, and on-chain specifically we made sure that every airdrop went to a specific address to ensure that you couldn't double collect.""  There was also intense scrutiny around the capacity and scalability of the blockchain. Aptos reportedly handled fewer than seven transactions a second, despite touting 100,000/second during the testing phase.  ""In our testnets, many folks in our community verified the traffic that was going through our network – which was in the thousands per second,"" Ching said. ""That was inferior hardware to what we're using today on mainnet. We're really looking to push our mainnet to its limits.""  ""We are working on exposing more metrics to the public. We had a spike of more than 2,500 TPS.""  Written in Move  The code underlying the Aptos blockchain is written with Move, a Rust-based programming language that is also set to be used by the forthcoming Sui blockchain. Move was originally developed at Meta to be used to power the Diem blockchain.  ""Move in many ways is inspired by Rust,"" Ching said. ""The difference here is that Move is built for smart contract language development. We found that this would be easier for developers to build compared to languages like Solidity.""  But there are concerns over blockchain safety when using a relatively new programming language, especially in light of the recent surge in crypto-related hacks and exploits that has seen billions of dollars stolen annually.  ""We took an extreme amount of care before launch. What we did was break it down into different areas of potential vulnerabilities, working with auditors and work with other projects in the space to identify the riskiest areas. Move is safe from a verified perspective, but we've taken an even more paranoid approach to make sure things are safe,"" Ching said.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Macroeconomic uncertainty reigns but bitcoin continued to hold tight comfortably above $20K. DOGE plunged late on Thursday after news that Twitter was halting work on its crypto wallet project.  Insights: Alamedia Research and crypto exchange FTX are bound together, a recent Alameda document underlines.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,013.27 +4.9 ▲ 0.5% Bitcoin (BTC) $20,283 +83.6 ▲ 0.4% Ethereum (ETH) $1,539 +7.9 ▲ 0.5% S&P 500 daily close  3,719.89 −39.8 ▼ 1.1% Gold  $1,634 −11.7 ▼ 0.7% Treasury Yield 10 Years  4.12% ▲ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Sails Along; DOGE Plummets Late  By James Rubin  The global economy saw more stormy weather on Thursday as the U.S. Labor Department announced a small dip in weekly jobless claims just a few hours after the Bank of England boosted its interest rate by a jumbo-sized 75 basis points, matching recent U.S. hikes.  The two unrelated events underscored the difficulties central banks are facing in cooling the still hot job market and stemming inflation, and they sent equities downward.  However, bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, continued to sail along at roughly the same levels they’ve maintained for much of the past two weeks. BTC was holding steady at about $20,200, while ETH continued to hover over $1,500 – both up a few smidgens during the past 24 hours. Crypto investors have recently been undeterred by a raft of evidence that conditions are still not ready to settle down.  “Hawkish monetary policy and macroeconomic uncertainty rage on,” CoinDesk crypto markets analyst Glenn Williams wrote. “But crypto investors ultimately have little else on their mind than cost basis.”  A number major tokens spent much of the day trading solidly in the green, with MATIC and LRC recently up nearly 11% and 7%, respectively. But popular meme coin DOGE plunged more than 9% following a report that Twitter's mercurial new owner, Elon Musk, was halting work on the social media platform's crypto wallet. The token spiked 16% last week as Musk, an avid DOGE supporter, neared completion of his $44 billion deal. Musk's activities and utterances have consistently influenced DOGE's price.  The job market may soon offer more concrete evidence that central bank measures to tame rising prices are working. Job cuts by online retail giant Amazon and ride-share service Uber sent equity markets falling. The tech-focused Nasdaq dropped 1.7%, while the S&P 500 was off 1%. Amazon warned that business would be declining. Safe haven gold continued a recent series of declines, and was down 0.4%.  In an interview on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Bilal Little, president of asset management platform DFD Partners, said the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate boost provided markets with clarity and that investors would pivot to next week's Consumer Price Index for the latest read on inflation.  Little struck an upbeat note about bitcoin, saying that investors would be ""looking to assets for better returns, in this case bitcoin.""  ""The market is looking for a nice surprise to the upside,"" he said.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polygon MATIC +10.8% Smart Contract Platform Loopring LRC +7.0% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK +3.7% Computing  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA −15.1% Entertainment Dogecoin DOGE −9.1% Currency Shiba Inu SHIB −1.8% Currency  Insights  By Sam Reynolds  Alameda Research and FTX, which once both had Sam Bankman-Fried at the top, have tried to create a firewall between the two firms more recently.  In October 2021, SBF handed over control of Alameda Research to Caroline Ellison and Sam Trabucco. Concerns about conflicts of interest were rising because Alameda had the tripartite role as a market maker, investor and trader.  Many FTX users didn’t like that SBF, and by virtue FTX, led the firms as they might find themselves lining the pockets of Alameda as they traded a new token it was market making or, perhaps worse, being on the other side of a trade against Alameda.  A firewall was put in place, and the SBF-led empire tried to make Alameda a separate institution from FTX.  The biggest asset  But recently, CoinDesk came into possession of an internal Alameda document that outlined its balance sheet.  And the biggest assets on the books? FTX’s FTT token.  This makes the two firms bound to each other.  FTT’s token officially gives exchange users discounts on trading fees if they stake it. But, practically, it operates as something akin to stock. In good times, FTT’s token rises; in bad times, it declines. Apropos, whenever bad news about Binance hits the newswires, its eponymous token, BNB, declines.  So now, approximately $5.2 billion of Alameda’s net worth of $14.6 billion is tied up in “unlocked FTT” and “FTT collateral.”  If, for some reason, FTX faces a crisis, or a fierce competitor, Alameda risks becoming less liquid. If there’s a massive market drawdown, the contagion between a crippled FTX and Alameda would create a catastrophe that would make Three Arrows Capital’s “Lehman moment” look like a monthly cyclical correction.  Likewise, there’s still a problematic relationship between FTX and Alameda. Market manipulation is on everyone’s mind, which is why in TradFi such an arrangement would not be allowed.  The dynamic would be similar in theory to the New York Stock Exchange and market-maker goliath Citadel Securities having the same parent, with NYSE and its executives emphasizing stocks being market made by Citadel. Such ingredients would be ripe for a congressional inquiry. But these types of relationships don’t happen because TradFi market makers are bound by registration requirements and some form of transparency.  There’s $41 million of SOL also on Alameda’s books, as Solana was an investment by FTX and a made market by Alameda. Solana has fallen out of favor with traders given its frequent ""breakdowns"" and the questionable size of its development community. When Alameda and FTX were pushing this token throughout the summer of 2021, did they know something that retail did not?  Occasionally, over-the-counter deals Alameda is involved in, such as with Reef Finance, sometimes go wrong and retail traders are left to punt around in the shadows of the elites.  Like many crypto companies, Alameda exists as a collection of corporate entities spanning multiple countries from the Far East to Delaware. Has anyone seen a list of shareholders?
