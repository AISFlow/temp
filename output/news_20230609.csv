13666375,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537304,1686351695,Bitcoin “Throwback” Could Trigger Flawless Technical Bottom Formation,"Bitcoin price is struggling after failing to make it above resistance last month. Combined with the recent pressure on the crypto market applied by the US SEC, things aren’t looking great for bulls. However, the correction has stopped precisely at a key level that could indicate a “throwback” is in process. If confirmed, BTCUSD could trade above $40,000 per coin in the near future. A Closer Look At The Technical Bottom Formation In Crypto The study of technical analysis uses past price history to predict probabilities in future market movements. Certain patterns have been discovered time and time again, that produce reasonably replicable results. From the size or shape of the pattern, analysts can derive roughly how far the associated breakout should travel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests Moving Average That Marked All Major Market Bottoms Bitcoin price action over the last year has formed what appears to be a technically flawless inverse head and shoulders pattern. The inverse head and shoulders is a bullish reversal pattern that appears at the bottom of a trend as it change direction. It consists of a left shoulder, head, a right shoulder, and a neckline. The head must be lower than each shoulder, and the neckline is of extra importance, because that’s where the abundance of orders are associated. Is this a throwback to the neckline? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com What Exactly Is A Bitcoin Throwback, And Why Does It Matter? A throwback occurs after a breakout of the neckline, when the market isn’t convinced of the bullish move. The neckline holding is a sign to others that the pattern could confirm, and more traders pile in creating a breakout and strong move higher. When using the example as a comparison, the resulting breakout could reach as much as over $40,000 per BTC. Related Reading: Rare Crypto Signal Emerges That Could Spark Another 2017-Style Boom When bullish patterns fail, the result is called a “busted” pattern and can cause a further crash as long traders are stopped out below the neckline. Stop loss levels are placed below the neckline, because a confirmed pattern will not breach below this point. Therefore, for the pattern to confirm, holding the neckline is especially critical. Will we see this bullish chart pattern ultimately confirm, or fail? This chart appeared in issue #7 of CoinChartist VIP alongside a dozen other exclusive crypto charts.

13666374,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537216,1686351631,"Crypto Investor Sentiment Refuses To Budge, But Can The Weekend Change This?","Crypto investor sentiment has been in the same place for over a month as investors have been hard-pressed to make a decision. This comes amid heightened regulatory headwinds with the United States Securities & Exchange Commission suing the likes of Binance and Coinbase. But could a change be coming soon? Crypto Fear & Greed Index Remains Neutral Following the market surge of Q1 2023 where Bitcoin was able to reclaim the $30,000 level, the market has been in a somewhat downward spiral since then. This has cumulated in investors being unwilling to place bets on whether the market will move up or down, bringing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to one of its longest stretches in neutral territory. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Declines As Market Recovers Amid Security Charges Presently, the index is sitting at a complete dead center of 50 on the scale which ranks sentiment from 1-100. 1-25 marks the extreme fear territory, 26-46 marks the fear level, 54-75 means greed and 76-100 is extreme greed. The 47-53 range is reserved for the neutral territory. At this point, the index points to a lack of activity from investors. This is understandable given that investors are currently waiting for more clarity from regulators to determine if investing in the digital assets right now is a good idea or not. Fear & Greed Index spends over one month in neutral | Source: alternative.me The index has now spent the better part of the last month in this neutral territory as the tug-of-war between the bulls and the bears come to a standstill. So there is no significant movement expected in either direction while it remains this way. Can The Weekend Shift Market Sentiment? The weekend has historically been a period of time characterized by low volatility due to reduced market participation from investors as they take a break from the markets. However, there have also been times when the weekend has come with the most bullish or bearish movements for the market. Total market cap sitting at $1.074 trillion as investors capitulate | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com As the market heads into another weekend, the possibility of a shift occurring during this time, although not very high, remains present. This is because, with low momentum, it is easier for the markets to swing one way or another with less volume than required on a weekday. Related Reading: Here’s Why Ethereum Could Be At Risk Of Falling To $1,000 Again Given this, there could be a rapid surge if bulls are able to beat the $27,000 level for Bitcoin in the next couple of days. But bears are awarded just as much opportunity during this time, especially if Bitcoin fails to hold the $26,000 support. Nevertheless, a swift movement in either direction could shake investors out of their current wary state to jump back into the market once more.

42393354,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTAQp,1686347663,"SEC Clampdown Spurs $4B Deposit Flight From Binance, Coinbase and Binance.US","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against Binance, Binance.US and Coinbase have spurred the exodus of some $4 billion of deposits from the crypto exchange giants, according to blockchain data.  The three exchanges suffered a combined net outflow of $3.1 billion via the Ethereum network and $864 million in bitcoin (BTC) between Monday and Thursday, data from blockchain analytics firms Nansen and Glassnode shows. Net outflow means withdrawals outpaced incoming deposits.  The exchanges processed withdrawals in an orderly fashion through the week.  The SEC first filed a lawsuit Monday against Binance, its U.S.-based entity Binance.US and chief executive Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, for a slew of federal securities law violations. Then, the agency sued Coinbase on Tuesday for offering unregistered securities to the public.  Read more: Binance and Coinbase: Experts Weigh What’s Coming Next  The actions unsettled the cryptocurrency market, with tokens the SEC characterized as securities in the suits, including Binance’s BNB, Cardano’s ADA and Polygon’s MATIC tumbling the most during the week. The SEC is seeking to freeze assets on Binance.US, which caused BTC and ether (ETH) to trade at a significant premium for a period compared to other platforms, as traders and market makers retreat from the platform.  Crypto traders, spooked by the regulatory clampdown, took their funds en masse from the exchanges targeted by the SEC.  Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, experienced a $2 billion net outflow on the Ethereum blockchain over the course of four days, Nansen data shows. The metric includes ETH and all Ethereum-based tokens.  BTC withdrawals also outpaced deposits by some $838 million (31,868 BTC) during this period, according to Glassnode data.  Wednesday’s net outflow of 13,953 BTC was the largest daily drawdown since last December, when a botched reserve report shook investors confidence – already shaky after the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s rival exchange FTX – in the exchange.  While this week’s outflows were significant, they represent only about 5% of all assets on the exchange, according to Binance’s crypto wallets.  Coinbase endured $1 billion of net outflows via Ethereum from Monday to Thursday, according to Nansen. BTC outflows totaled $25 million, per Glassnode.  Binance.US net outflows totaled $75 million on Ethereum, Nansen data shows. Glassnode does not track the platform.  The U.S.-based exchange said on Friday that users should withdraw USD as soon as possible following the SEC’s ""extremely aggressive and intimidating tactics"" against the company. The platform has suspended U.S. dollar deposits and will delist USD trading pairs shortly, while it temporarily transitions to a crypto-only exchange.

U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick ruled on Thursday that Ooki DAO operated an illegal trading platform and unlawfully acted as an unregistered futures commission merchant (FCM), granting the CFTC a default judgment. He ordered the organization to pay $643,542 in penalty, to permanently cease its operations and shut down its website.  The original lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California last September, alleged the DAO offered ""leveraged and margined"" commodities transactions to retail customers and neglected to observe know-your-consumer laws while serving those traders.

13664440,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537261,1686346216,Tron Upward Price Momentum At Risk Unless Key Resistance Is Breached,"Over the past few weeks, the price of Tron (TRX) has experienced an upward movement. However, it has struggled to break through a crucial resistance level for a significant period of time. In the last 24 hours, TRX saw a 1% increase, while on the weekly chart, it recorded a 3% gain. The bullish momentum has been maintained since surpassing the $0.68 price level. The technical outlook suggests a potential shift towards bullish influence. Related Reading: Cardano Price Threatens Multi-Month Low Unless Bulls Defend This Support Demand and accumulation indicators have shown improvement in the daily timeframe. While Tron has managed to resist the broader market sentiments affecting other altcoins, it remains vulnerable to fluctuations in the Bitcoin price. To sustain its daily gains, it is crucial for TRX to surpass the immediate resistance level. Failure to do so may result in a reversal of its upward trend. The increase in the TRX market capitalization indicates that demand has started to revisit the market. Tron Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, Tron (TRX) was trading at $0.078. The altcoin faced overhead resistance at $0.079, and a successful move above this level would likely propel TRX above the $0.080 mark. However, if it is rejected at $0.079, the coin could experience a significant decline. It is worth noting that TRX has previously faced rejection at the $0.083 level, which will serve as an important resistance. On the downside, the nearest support for Tron is located at $0.074. If TRX fails to hold above this support level, it may drop further to $0.068. The trading volume of TRX in the last session was green, suggesting that buyers have started to establish control over the price. Technical Analysis Following a period of decreased investor interest earlier this month, Tron (TRX) is currently showing signs of recovery in terms of demand on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that buyers are exerting dominance in the market, as it is above the half-line. This suggests a positive sentiment and increased buying pressure. Additionally, the price of TRX has moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that buyers are in control of the price momentum in the market. This further supports the notion that buyer dominance is prevailing. To sustain this buyer momentum, it is crucial for TRX to break past the $0.079 resistance level. If TRX successfully surpasses this level, it may continue its upward movement Contrary to rising demand, TRX has maintained sell signals on the daily chart based on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. The MACD histogram formed red bars, indicating sell signals for the altcoin. This suggests a potential decline in price if TRX fails to move above the immediate resistance level. Related Reading: MATIC Price Shows Bullish Formation – What’s Next? Furthermore, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures capital inflows and outflows, is below the half-line.

On Monday, the SEC had filed a lawsuit against Binance and, in that filing, specifically named a number of alt-coins, including FileCoin ( FIL-USD ) as assets that the regulator considers to be securities. Grayscale intends to continue providing reports for the trust according to the Alternative Reporting Standards of the OTCQB, it said. The company originally filed the registration statement for Grayscale Filecoin Trust ( OTCQB:FILG ) on April 14, 2023. On May 16, Grayscale said it received a comment letter from the SEC staff requesting that it withdraw the trust's registration statement. In that comment, the SEC staff stated its view that the trust's underlying asset, filecoin ( FIL-USD ) meets the definition of a security under federal securities law. Earlier this week, Grayscale, providing an analysis of Howey case law, responded to the SEC staff with an explanation of the legal basis for Grayscale's position that FIL is not a security. In subsequent written correspondence, following the SEC's naming of FIL as a security in certain filings in federal district court, the SEC staff reiterated its request for Grayscale to seek withdrawal of the FILG's registration statement. In its withdrawal request, Grayscale said it continued to believe that filecoin ( FIL-USD ) is not a security.

42393366,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTBG7,1686342441,Where the Mt. Gox Money Went: New Details in the BTC-e Exchange Case,"New unsealed court documents shed fresh light on what happened with the massive amounts of bitcoin stolen from Mt. Gox, the bitcoin that was hacked spectacularly starting in 2011.  The two unsealed indictments offer a rare glimpse into the U.S. law enforcement investigations into two of the oldest bitcoin companies, Mt. Gox and BTC-e.  According to the indictment unsealed on Friday, Mt. Gox was hacked not long after the exchange was founded in 2010 by two Russian nationals, Alexander Verner and Alexey Bilyuchenko, as well as their unnamed co-conspirators. With most of its crypto gone, Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy in 2014.  In 2011, Verner and Bilyuchenko got access to the Mt. Gox users’ data and transactions database, along with the private keys for the exchange’s crypto. Between 2011 and 2014, Verner, Bilyuchenko and the unnamed co-conspirators funneled no less than 647,000 bitcoin out of the Mt. Gox wallets, the indictment released this week says.  Fully 300,000 of those coins went to BTC-e, another now-defunct crypto exchange. BTC-e was shut down by the FBI in 2017, and the exchange’s alleged operator, Russian national Alexander Vinnik, was arrested in Greece and later extradited to the U.S. to face charges for “computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials and narcotics distribution rings.”  Bilyuchenko was the administrator of BTC-e, according to the criminal case involving him in Russia. According to his testimony, cited in the book of a Russian investigative journalist Andrey Zakharov, Verner was responsible for technical development of BTC-e. Bilyuchenko was reportedly arrested in Russia in 2019, but the whereabouts of Bilyuchenko and Verner today are not known.  Money trail  A separate indictment unsealed this week shows that Verner and Bilyuchenko transferred the bitcoin they stole from Mt. Gox to BTC-e, TradeHill (another early bitcoin exchange shut down in 2013, according to Investopedia) and their own accounts at Mt. Gox itself.  To liquidate the stolen bitcoin, Verner and Bilyuchenko used U.S. companies, the indictment says, though the document does not name particular firms that might have been involved. The investigation report unsealed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) this week mentions transactions between BTC-e and BitInstant and Memory Dealers, two early and now-defunct bitcoin companies.  Read more: Jeff Wilser – The Legacy of Mt. Gox – Why Bitcoin’s Greatest Hack Still Matters  BitInstant was a crypto exchange founded by Charlie Shrem, who in 2014 was sentenced to two years in prison for money laundering charges. Memory Dealers was a bitcoin-friendly computer hardware vendor run by Roger Ver, the founding father of the Bitcoin Cash cryptocurrency.  Between April and November 2013, Verner and Bilyuchenko received $2.5 million from BitInstant and Memory Dealers to a bank account of BTC-e’s shell company, the Seychelles-registered Canton Business Corporation, according to the DHS.  The wire payments from BitInstant and Memory Dealers were labeled as an “Internet Advertisement Agreement,” but BTC-e did not provide any advertising services to BitInstant or Memory Dealers, the investigators found. The BTC-e operators would also send money from their bitcoin sales through multiple PayPal accounts to conceal their origins, the report says.  From March 2012 to April 2013, a crypto exchange named in Verner and Bilyuchencko’s indictment as “the New York Bitcoin Broker,” sent about $6.6 million to the hackers’ bank accounts in exchange for “credit” on BTC-e. It’s not known what firm that was exactly.  BTC-e also used the Australia-based forex exchange FX Open and U.K.-based Mayzus Financial Services for transactions with fiat money, the documents say.  Unsealing the history of BTC-e  The unsealed indictment also clears the names of several people who previously have been considered by the investigators as Vinnik’s co-conspirators in running BTC-e.  According to the previous version of Vinnik’s indictment filed under seal in 2016, the Department of Justice earlier believed that Vinnik had a co-founder, named Andrey Nikonorov, as well as co-owners of the BTC-e shell company, Seychelles-registered Canton Business Corporation, Alexander Buyanov and Stanislav Golovanov.  However, the new version of Vinnik’s indictment says that Nikonorov, Buyanov and Golovanov actually did not participate in the criminal activities related to BTC-e, but rather, Vinnik used their identities to cover his tracks, the DOJ attorney Ismail Ramsey wrote.  “When conducting business related to BTC-e, Defendant Alexander Vinnik made efforts to  conceal his true identity. This included appropriating the identities of Andrey Nikonorov, Stanislav Golovanov, and Alexander Buyanov,” the document reads.  Andrey Nikonorov, who was also a co-founder of the ZrCoin crypto project, told CoinDesk today he knew Vinnik but was merely a user of BTC-e and provided the exchange with his identifying documents to be able to conduct a bank transfer. He also believes that Vinnik himself was just an employee of BTC-e who did not come across as a wealthy business owner at all.  Russian news outlet RBK talked to Alexander Buyanov for an investigation into BTC-e in 2017, and Buyanov, who was a DJ at a Moscow nightclub at the time, told the outlet he did not know anything about BTC-e before the news of its shutdown and Vinnik’s arrest.  Mt. Gox, Silk Road, Fancy Bear  BTC-e was an exchange powerhouse back in the day, and a big part of its money came from various crimes, the DOJ says. Starting in 2011, the exchange served about 700,000 users and its bitcoin wallet received over 9.4 million BTC before December 2016, the DOJ said.  Users included the ransomware gang CryptoWall and Fancy Bear, the hacker group believed to be sponsored by GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency. Fancy Bear hacked the computer systems of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential campaign. The hackers used BTC-e for their crypto dealings, as well as two other, unnamed crypto exchanges, according to the blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic.  Other high profile users were Carl Mark Force and Shaun W. Bridges, the two FBI agents convicted for misappropriation of crypto from the Silk Road investigation. The former agents sent “several hundred thousand dollars in criminal proceeds” each to BTC-e, the unsealed indictment for Vinnik reads.  “Their experience with the criminal underworld taught them that using BTC-e, as opposed to a registered exchange with anti-money laundering policies, would maximize their chances of being able to conceal criminal proceeds,” the document says.  Silk Road was a popular darknet marketplace offering a wide range of illicit drugs for purchase with bitcoin. Silk Road was busted by the FBI in 2013, and its founder Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 on charges for narcotics trafficking, money laundering, computer hacking and trafficking fraudulent identity documents.  As the FBI investigated the Silk Road, the two rogue agents saw a chance to make money for themselves. Carl Force offered Ulbricht fake drivers’ licenses, as well as insider information on the government’s investigation into Silk Road, in return for 925 bitcoin, which he received and used for his own benefit, according to a criminal complaint filed under seal in 2015 by then IRS special agent Tigran Gambaryan (now Binance’s head of financial crime compliance).  Bridges, in turn, got access to the wallets containing Silk Road’s treasury while being a part of the FBI’s investigative team, and stole 1,600 bitcoin from those wallets. Force was sentenced to six years in prison 2015; Bridges got two years behind bars in 2017.  Force and Bridges sent their ill-gotten crypto to exchanges CampBX, Bitstamp and Mt.Gox. As for BTC-e, they used it to further cover their tracks, documents show.  Prisoner swap hopes  The new documents come to light as Alexander Vinnik is trying to return to his home country, Russia.  Alexander Vinnik and his lawyer David Rizk convinced the Northern District court of California to unseal more documents in the case as they believe making the case more public will help advocate for Vinnik’s prisoner swap with Russia, according to the court file. Vinnik might be swapped with Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia under espionage charges, the newspaper wrote in May.  Vinnik has spent almost five years in detention abroad. He was first detained in August 2017 in Greece while on vacation with family, then extradited to France and ended up in the Santa Rita prison in the U.S. in August 2022.  He faces charges including operation of an unlicensed money services business, conspiracy to commit money laundering, money laundering and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions. If convicted, Vinnik could face a maximum penalty of 55 years in prison.

42393361,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTAvb,1686339101,Binance and Coinbase: Experts Weigh What’s Coming Next,"After years of grandstanding on crypto, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has finally put skin in the game.  A lot of skin.  The crypto-skeptic regulator – who over the course of his tenure has insinuated that proof-of-stake tokens are securities, intimated that all crypto exchanges are illegal enterprises and implied that all but one cryptocurrencies are ""investment contracts"" in line with the Howey Test, a standard for deciding whether financial assets are securities – this week sued Binance and Coinbase.  See also: The SEC Has Started an All-In Political Battle Over Crypto  Up against the world’s largest crypto exchange (Binance) and the largest publicly-traded crypto company (Coinbase), it’s likely Gensler is in for a fight. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said months ago that the SEC was building its case, and, if it sued, the exchange would counter.  Gensler’s is the type of federal enforcement action that could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. The case against Coinbase, an exchange used by tens of thousands of U.S. citizens (that went public days before Gensler’s confirmation), could spur congressional action on crypto regulation. Further, the more wide-ranging accusations against Binance, damning if true, could capsize what is likely one of the most profitable businesses of the 21st century so far.  See also: Can Binance Survive the SEC's Charges? | Opinion  Those are the known-unknowns. But the SEC’s one-two punch this week also revealed new information about the agency’s approach to crypto, and why it has been so aggressive.  CoinDesk reached out to a number of legal authorities and crypto observers to get a better sense of what is likely to happen next with the cases and what they could mean for the future of the industry. The resulting roundtable discussion offers a diverse view on an uncertain situation with many moving pieces.  Are there reasons for the companies to be optimistic about the lawsuits?  Brian Frye, attorney: Yes. Maybe. I am not optimistic about the SEC’s claim against Binance. The complaint is brutal. Binance has essentially admitted to everything the SEC alleges. It’s a disaster.  I think Coinbase is much better situated. It has been trying to comply with the SEC’s rules for quite some time and the SEC has refused to even engage with Coinbase’s good faith efforts at compliance. I don’t think that’s a good look, and I think at least some courts might object to it.  Courts expect agencies to act in predictable ways. Coinbase has been asking the SEC what it wants and the SEC has been refusing to respond. That could make Coinbase look like the good actor and the SEC look like the bad actor.  Also, I think it is a problem that the SEC has still not provided an even remotely coherent explanation of what it wants to regulate, what it thinks it’s authorized to regulate, why it wants to regulate, how it wants to regulate, what it wants its regulations to achieve or really literally anything.  The SEC has spent years saying it dislikes crypto assets of any kind, but it hasn’t explained why it dislikes them, it hasn’t explained why it thinks they’re a problem and it hasn’t even pretended to explain how it would regulate crypto assets in a way that it thinks would be more consistent with its regulatory mandate.  It’s a security if the SEC wants to regulate it – Brian Frye  That’s a problem. Agencies have to be credible and the SEC has a credibility problem. It’s flexing its muscles and can create a lot of pain for crypto companies in the short term. But it has to think about the longer term as well.  The SEC has recently been slapped down by the courts for overstepping its authority in relation to ALJs [the Administrative Law Judge]. I wouldn’t be surprised if courts at least take a hard look at its approach to crypto assets. Especially in relation to businesses that are trying to comply, but being rebuffed by the agency.  Mike Selig, attorney: The SEC lawsuits aren’t entirely bad for crypto. Against the backdrop of these lawsuits, foreign jurisdictions are adopting crypto laws and regulations and U.S. lawmakers are debating crypto market structure legislation on the Hill. Political pressure on U.S. lawmakers to pass sensible crypto legislation becomes stronger every time that the SEC sues another crypto business – especially if that business has been vocal about its attempts to comply with applicable laws and regulations.  These lawsuits encourage businesses seeking to comply with clearly applicable rules to leave the U.S. since foreign jurisdictions welcome them with open arms and a fresh set of laws and regulations. Yet there is reason to be optimistic about the recent SEC lawsuits leveled against two of the largest crypto businesses in the world because these lawsuits can catalyze Congress to recognize that the SEC’s approach to regulation by enforcement is not working and comprehensive legislation is needed – or else the industry will flee to more accommodating jurisdictions.  Kristin Smith, Blockchain Association CEO: This week’s actions by the SEC make the path forward clear – and urgent: Congress must act. Last week’s introduction of the Digital Asset Market Structure discussion draft by Rep. Patrick McHenry, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Rep. Glenn Thompson, chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, is a step forward in the process toward effective regulation. It’s critical that the United States remains competitive at a time when countries around the world are taking action to bring responsible regulation to crypto.  In the short-term, do you expect Binance or Coinbase will change their approach to business?  Smith: The SEC doesn’t make the law – it only makes accusations. An enforcement action is just the opinion of the regulator – the courts will decide if its interpretation of the law is correct. Until and unless the SEC prevails, it will likely be business as usual.  See also: Crypto Industry Is 'Absolutely' at War Against Gensler and Warren, Blockchain Association CEO Smith Says  Did the SEC’s suits against Binance and Coinbase reveal anything new about how the agency has been thinking about crypto?  Frye: Yes and no. I think the lawsuits illustrate what I’ve been saying for a long time, but people just don’t want to hear. “Is it a security?,” just isn’t an ontological question. It’s a security if the SEC wants to regulate it. So the real question is, what does the SEC want to regulate, why does it want to regulate those things, how can companies comply with the SEC’s regulatory objectives and does any of it make any sense.  Selig: To quote Battlestar Galactica, “All of this has happened before. All of this will happen again.” The SEC has been incrementally building legal theories with regard to the security status of crypto assets and the proper registration categories for various crypto asset intermediaries for many years. The Coinbase and Binance lawsuits are the culmination of everything that came before. Neither case provides a significant amount of new information about how the SEC is thinking about crypto, but, if you want to understand the agency’s views on crypto, then these are the complaints to read.  That said, there are a handful of novel aspects to these complaints. With Coinbase, the SEC for the first time asserts that offering unhosted digital wallet software is broker-dealer activity because the wallet can be used to buy and sell alleged securities via third-party decentralized applications and the software developer takes a fee.  In Binance, the SEC asserts that BUSD, a U.S. dollar stablecoin issued by a New York limited purpose trust company regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services, is a security under novel theories – i.e. Binance using profits from sales of BUSD to offer various yield programs to BUSD holders. And in both complaints, the SEC argues that many crypto assets are securities that it has not previously deemed to be securities in lawsuits against the issuers or other secondary participants.  Thinking long term: What would crypto look like if the SEC wins, and Coinbase/Binance lose in the Supreme Court?  Frye: Good question, it depends on what the SEC wants to achieve. If it wants to destroy crypto, it probably can, if Congress lets it. Or at least, it could regulate crypto back to its late 2000s stage. But I don’t think it will happen. The SEC is conservative and finds novelty distasteful, but it also recognizes that it’s in the business of regulating markets. I think it will eventually realize it has to take its regulatory role a little more seriously.  SEC hasn’t even tried to promulgate coherent regulations for crypto assets  But again, I am disappointed by the SEC and its response to crypto regulation. I think regulation can be good and effective. But the SEC hasn’t even tried to promulgate coherent regulations for crypto assets. It’s just punting over and over again. It’s embarrassing and the regulators should be ashamed of themselves. The public deserves better. And the regulators should care about actually doing their job, which means understanding the markets they purport to regulate and explaining the rationale for their regulatory decisions. It’s a total fail on that front and it’s unacceptable.  Selig: The future of crypto within the U.S. is likely to be determined by Congress rather than the courts. If the SEC wins in its lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance, Ripple and others (even all the way up to the Supreme Court), we are nevertheless likely to see legislation that establishes a sensible regulatory market structure for crypto assets work its way through Congress. Coinbase, Binance and other crypto ecosystem participants will eventually have a path to compliance. Every major foreign jurisdiction is moving in this direction and it is very unlikely that the U.S. will remain the sole holdout.  If you were/are a lawyer for one of the major tokens named as a security in either suit, how would you counsel that token’s foundation?  Frye: I would advise them to write off the asset and anticipate paying a fine. Maybe a big one.  Selig: Development companies and foundations associated with any of the crypto assets named in the lawsuits may be inclined to intervene to defend the non-security status of the crypto asset. These entities should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of doing so with legal counsel. Developers and users on these networks should likewise consult with legal counsel regarding their activities, but the SEC’s assertions that certain crypto assets are securities are just assertions. They are not yet supported by a judicial determination on security status.  Do you suspect these cases will change how Congress approaches crypto regulation?  Frye: I think this is absolutely a watershed moment. Ultimately, Congress decides what agencies can do. The Biden administration seems to be IDGAF to whatever Gensler wants when it comes to crypto, which honestly makes sense; he’s got bigger stuff on his plate. But Congress can pass new legislation, at least in theory. It can encourage the Biden administration to appoint new administrators. And it can object to how the SEC makes decisions.  Selig: The SEC’s jurisdictional land grab may serve to bite it. Lawmakers on the Hill have been keen to expand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC), rather than the SEC’s, jurisdiction over crypto assets and even contract SEC authority to the extent it has any over crypto assets associated with decentralized or functional networks. Instead of issuing sensible rules that are workable for the crypto asset industry and thereby lessening the need for a comprehensive legislative solution involving the CFTC, the SEC has regulated by enforcement and antagonized the industry. As a result, industry participants are likely to favor the other market regulator.  Is there a chance the current situation will result in a regulation that would either outlaw most (if not all) cryptocurrencies, or subject them to prohibitive registration and other requirements?  Frye: Yes, but I doubt it. I think it’s more likely that the SEC will make it harder to introduce new cryptocurrencies.  Selig: It is highly unlikely that the current situation will result in laws or regulations that effectively ban crypto assets within the U.S. Lawmakers and regulators across the globe recognize the immense potential of crypto as a technology and are developing sensible legal frameworks for the asset class. The U.S. is late to the party, but will FOMO in too. Every novel investment product from renewable energy credits to credit default swaps goes through a period of regulatory hazing before becoming initiated as a properly regulated and validated asset class. Crypto will be no different.  Is there anything you think is missing from the public discourse regarding crypto law?  Matt Stoller, antitrust activist: It seems like while the courts or Congress could do random things, the hype machine of crypto has moved to AI, which – while it has a lot of hype associated with it – is a useful technology. So the only question for crypto boosters is, can they deliver an actual use case beyond money laundering and speculation?  What message do these cases send to other crypto exchanges? If you were a U.S. crypto exchange would you be worried?  Frye: Yes. The SEC is making it clear that it is acting, but it isn’t what the SEC wants to achieve. That’s a problem.  Selig: The SEC Enforcement Division’s message is clear: “We generally agree with SEC Chair Gensler’s view that most crypto assets are securities.” This is evidenced by the fact that the agency has now asserted that the majority of the top-ten crypto assets by market capitalization are securities, notably excluding bitcoin and ether.  See also: Coinbase Violated Securities Laws With Staking Program, Multiple U.S. States Allege  Nevertheless, the law is not settled and will be litigated in numerous lawsuits, including the Coinbase and Binance cases. The agency is spending a ton of resources to litigate with Coinbase and Binance. I would be surprised if we see many more crypto asset exchange-related cases brought by the SEC in the near term. Crypto asset exchanges must continue to evaluate whether each crypto asset is a security based on the unique facts and circumstances associated with each crypto asset.  There are several accusations made about Binance that would be damning if true, including accusations of wash trading and practices that would put customers at risk (some reminiscent of FTX). Is there a cause of concern about using the exchange going forward?  Frye: I have no idea, but maybe yes?  Is there an SEC Chair that would be worse for crypto than Gary Gensler? (I.e. what would be even more damaging for crypto than these two cases?)  Frye: Everyone in the crypto space complains about Gary Gensler. I am also critical of his approach to regulation. But what if the head of the SEC was Lina Khan [head of the Federal Trade Commission]. Or more realistically, what if Lina Khan decided the FTC ought to regulate crypto offerings. Good luck, you’ll be begging for Gary.  See also: Gary Gensler's Evolving Position on Crypto – in Quotes  Smith: No, unfortunately, it’s clear Chair Gensler has a flagrant disregard for his agency’s own mission to protect investors. In this week alone, the SEC indirectly called some $120 billion worth of crypto assets securities. How does attempting to eliminate a market for these tokens protect investors?  Is it possible that the lawsuit will lead to either Binance or Coinbase, or both, shutting down in the U.S.?  Frye: Yes. I think it’s a very real possibility for Binance, based on the complaint, but very unlikely for Coinbase, which has done everything it can to comply with SEC rules and expectations, even when the SEC has misbehaved.  What did you make of Gary Gensler's statement about the world not needing digital currencies because the dollar, euro and yen are all digital? Why does Gensler make normative claims about the industry, rather than focusing on his actual mandate?  Smith: Gensler appears to now be showing all his cards: he doesn’t think digital currencies should exist in the United States. He clearly understands the technology and has been open to exploring its potential in the past. He also understands the business of publicly traded companies like Coinbase, what products and services the SEC has already approved, and their obligations to financial disclosures.

13661830,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537187,1686339012,Here’s How Current Bitcoin Capitulation Compares With Past Crashes,"On-chain data shows that Bitcoin short-term holders are depositing 0.82% of their supply to exchanges. Here’s how these inflows compare with past crashes. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Inflows Have Been Elevated Recently The BTC market can be divided into two broad investor groups, one of which is the “short-term holder (STHs) cohort.” The STHs are investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. Generally, the Bitcoin holders belonging to this group are the weakest hands in the market, as they may easily sell at the sight of any sharp volatility or uncertainty in the market. The opposite cohort is called the “long-term holder (LTH) group,” and it naturally includes all participants that have been carrying their BTC in their wallets since more than 155 days ago. These LTHs usually hold for large stretches of times, and they are the diamond hands in the sector who need to be pushed a lot before they start panic selling their coins. Recently, the Bitcoin market has observed the emergence of FUD in the market, as a result of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suing cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase. The market has acted volatile in both directions, but overall the price of the asset has gone down since the volatility has arrived. Obviously, in times like these, the STHs would be the first ones to break. In a new tweet, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has looked at the exchange inflow data of the STHs, to see how they are coping with the current situation. The below chart shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflow for these investors over the past year: Looks like the value of the metric has been a bit high in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange inflow for the STHs has been climbing recently and has now hit relatively high levels. The “exchange inflow” here refers to a metric that tracks the amount of the asset that these investors have been depositing into the wallets of centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Dormant 1,433 BTC Moves After 10+ Years One of the main reasons why investors transfer their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, so the exchange inflow data for these holders can provide us with hints about their current selling behavior. In the context of the current discussion, a modified version of the exchange inflow is being used; one that measures the inflows in terms of the percentage of the total STH Bitcoin supply. The STH exchange inflow has hit a value of 0.82% recently, meaning that these investors have recently been sending around 0.82% of their supply to these platforms. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Defies Gravity But Here Is Why It Could Decline Again This is certainly not a small value, but when compared to other panic selling events in the past year, namely the LUNA collapse, the FTX crash, and the relief rally in March 2023 (all marked with red on the chart), the current inflows are still quite low. This would mean that the latest uncertainty in the Bitcoin market hasn’t yet been enough to push the STHs into capitulating at levels similar to historical capitulation events.

42393353,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTAGZ,1686335759,The Memecoin Grift and How It Threatens Ethereum Culture,"The ceaseless and cynical pumping of tokens devoid of value is an existential threat to Ethereum’s reputation.  This memecoin culture is populated by the most chronically clout-addled people in the crypto industry, who exist in the Influencer Pit of Despair. This is a deep, dark hole where grifter influencers clamber over one another to rob the nearest retail tourist. You can locate the Influencer Pit in the form of a Twitter Space. But not just any Twitter Space. More like Twitter Spaces experienced as a debilitating K-Hole in a Prague dive-bar. And you’ve lost your wallet.  It’s a fundamental paradox that since anyone can use the Ethereum blockchain, anyone can use the Ethereum blockchain. If Ethereum were a local park, the memecoiners would be an unruly gang of teenagers listening to music on some god-forsaken Bluetooth speakers.  Paul Dylan-Ennis is a CoinDesk columnist and lecturer in the College of Business, University College Dublin.  Imagine you’re working on Eigenlayer or zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs or you’re an Arbitrum delegate. And while you’re valiantly working away on something useful you can’t help but grit your teeth to hear some braindead dolt just made a cool million by tweeting.  Memecoins will always be part of an open source network like Ethereum, but for cryptocurrency to be widely adopted the industry needs to find a way to collectively address its worst forms of valueless profit seeking.  There is something hopeless about how little is offered by the memecoin grift.  When pepe (PEPE) was created the team outright admitted that the project was pure memeology, propelled along by our favorite rehabilitated frog. There is, at this stage in the industry’s cycle, something quite empty about returning to the meme well, eking out a living as bottom feeders on some anon team’s larp. Its mindless algorithmic churn, like we invented the wheel but only used it to go in circles.  And those Spaces! My word. Memecoin Spaces seem to be required by law to have the most obnoxiously loud host, for no apparent reason. At least three of the speakers, sporting equally terrible NFT (non-fungible token) investments as their PFPs (profile pictures), will admit to several misdemeanors over the course of an hour. At least 75% of the audience has bought something from Supreme and made a loss on it.  Before you feel bad, let’s remember what the Influencer Pit does. It sucks in retail investors, selling them on the concept that financial nihilism is the truth. It contributes to the idea that blockchain (or crypto or Web3) is merely about speculation. It stipulates your only option in life is to hustle fast enough and hope you don’t end up as fodder for a CoffeeZilla video.  The latest trend is painfully banal. It’s such a low-brow grift I’m embarrassed to even write about it. Influencer grifters, often double-dipping from prior shilling of memecoins, will simply post an Ethereum address and ask people to send ether (ETH) to it. One can only hope the IRS does not ENS. The wink and nod in this scam is the explicit promise of no return. You would, and I mean this quite literally, be just as well setting fire to your physical wallet than sending a transaction like this.  In Ethereum there are no police. In a decentralized, permissionless culture there is nobody who can sanction you like the law might IRL  I’m not sure what the appropriate punishment should be for these crimes against humanity. First-time offenders might have to attend Bitcoin Miami wearing an Ethereum T-shirt. Serial offenders will need harsher punishments, perhaps trapped in a dark room with a Richard Heart monologue on repeat, for up to two years. We might instead decide to capture all the grifter influencers on an island somewhere. Perhaps we could create a fake conference, NFT Pitcairn Islands, and then create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) whose only purpose is to ensure no flight ever leaves, spending treasury funds on bribing the islanders to distract the influencers with shiny objects.  There is a real problem here. Influencer grifters tell us upfront ""you will get nothing"" and you will be happy. But underlying is a much darker message: We can do nothing. This is the paradox of permissionlessness intrinsic to blockchain communities. Permissionlessness is a red line, non-negotiable topic in Ethereum culture. Without wishing to get all esoteric, if you lost the property of permissionlessness you wouldn’t have Ethereum at all.  With technical solutions verboten this leaves us only with social options. Imagine Ethereum as a cosmopolitan city. It has its Municipal Hall of developers, organizers and researchers. It has its finance district with decentralized finance (DeFi). It has its bohemian quarter of NFTs. It has its Average Joes living on Main Street. But it also has its shady downtown where the grifters live.  Downtown is not as bad as Skid Row where you’ll probably find people plotting to social engineer Bored Ape owners. Like any city you can silo yourself in the safe areas and hope the police might deal with it. Except in Ethereum there are no police. In a decentralized, permissionless culture there is nobody who can sanction you like the law might IRL (of course governments can outside Ethereum).  This means you have to create an atmosphere, a cultural context, where the message of long-term regen culture overshadows short-term degen culture, relegating it to an immature phase. The regens are those within Ethereum culture dedicated to ensuring the technology does not generate negative externalities, but instead positively impacts society over the long term. How do we, in the words of Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki, funnel more Ethereans into regen than degen?  Here I advocate for something a little unorthodox. I believe Ethereum should introduce a Citizen’s Assembly. In my home country of Ireland, citizens are randomly selected to convene and discuss important issues relating to the Irish Constitution. In Ethereum, we don’t have a Constitution but there could be value in an annual forum where various stakeholders in Ethereum meet to discuss important concerns.  See also: Paul Dylan-Ennis – Who Is Building Ethereum's Public Goods? | Opinion  Similar to the open-source concept that many eyes can fix a problem quicker than a single pair can, the Ethereum Assembly could consider pressing issues (e.g. what to do about Lido, a decentralized service that is said to be dominating Ethereum staking) but also how to encourage people away from degen into regen with active efforts. Citizens from each stakeholder group, from validators to developers to application builders to Average Joes could come together and hash it out.  And the most important effect? I believe it would encourage a sense of responsibility over the protocol across the community spectrum, introducing social matters as important as technical ones.

The token has registered impressive gains over the past few days, leaving one to wonder about the reason behind such improvement. At the time of writing, LUNC price has increased by 0.71% in the last 24 hours and 16.95% over the past seven days. High Buying Pressure Pushes LUNC Price Amid Bearish Sentiments The increased activities on the Terra Classic network are seemingly one of the factors behind LUNC’s recent price gains. Based on Coinmarketcap data, LUNC’s market capitalization and trading volume have gained 17.75% above yesterday’s value. Related Reading: ApeCoin Holders Suffer Financial Pain As 95% Endure Negative Returns Although the price surge momentum has reduced slightly, LUNC remains among the top cryptos by trading volume. LUNC’s price increase has secured it a place among top cryptocurrencies in terms of trading volume. Other Notable Factors Behind LUNC Price Gains The price surge followed after the LUNC Burn Army shared news of the v2.1.0 upgrade proposal on June 3. The proposal’s governance vote started on June 7, while the upgrade will go live on June 14. This development generated a buzz in the LUNC community, attracting more attention to the LUNC token. The v2.1.0 upgrade is one of the biggest events in the Terra Classic community. It aims to bring LUNC to parity with other blockchains, including Terra 2.0 and Cosmos chains. This parity will allow developers and projects to resume building on the Terra Classic Chain. The v2.1.0 upgrade adds new features and improvements to Terra Classic, including allowing a minimum of 5% commission for validators aimed at promoting fair compensation. Also, it comes with Cosmwasm and two other security updates touted to improve the ecosystem’s security and reliability. Furthermore, the soon-coming upgrade will bring several notable changes to the Terra Classic ecosystem. The WasmVM upgrade will introduce multi-chain interoperability, extending Terra Classic’s capabilities. Community-focused Improvement Initiatives Besides the v2.1.0 upgrade, several other community-backed initiatives are responsible for LUNC’s recent price boosts and trading volume increase. Among these is the token burn initiative, which enhances the network’s utility. Furthermore, on June 6, the LUNC Burn Army introduced the Bug Bounty Incentive Program to foster application functionality, enhanced security, and network resilience. The Bug Bounty initiative aims to compensate ethical hackers, security researchers, and developers who identify and report security vulnerabilities. Related Reading: Here’s Why Ethereum Could Be At Risk Of Falling To $1,000 Again Moreover, the recently introduced LUNC burn initiative that saw over 1 billion LUNC tokens wiped from circulation is among the factors boosting the token’s price. These improvement proposals have helped to increase investor interest in LUNC and are among the drivers of the current price surge.

Despite the crypto markets being hit by a renewed wave of meme coin speculation in recent weeks, more investors are dumping their Dogecoin (DOGE) bags to participate in other tokens like Uwerx, which have better use cases. Let’s find out why investors are taking this ruthless path to participate in the promising presale of Uwerx and recover their lost meme coin-laden portfolio. Dogecoin (Dogecoin): A Crypto Once Loved By All Initially developed as a joke by two software engineers, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the first ever meme coin created in 2013. Elon Musk, nicknamed the Doge Father, has been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin (DOGE) and continues to tweet about the meme coin until many investors caught onto the revelation, sending the token’s price jumping on many occasions. Dogecoin (DOGE) cryptocurrency is currently the ninth largest cryptocurrency in the world, having a market capitalization of over $10 billion but has fallen off the good graces of the entire crypto community. Currently having a trading volume of $169.945, 370, and trading at $0.0734, less than 90% of his all-time high price of $0.7316. In the recent wake of meme coin trading, even degen traders have shifted their attention off Dogecoin (DOGE) to focus more on new meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu(FLOKI), which are currently making all the waves in the meme coin world. Because of this, experts predict the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) to reach a bare minimum of $0.095 in the last quarter of 2023. Uwerx (WERX): A Token Set To Ride The Wave And Establish Itself As The New Market Leader Uwerx has been in every investor’s mouth for completing their stage 1 and stage 2 presale in a record time of 17 days and 8 days, respectively. Uwerx platform is treading the least but most rewarding path of utility by offering freelancers a chance to enjoy the web3 community-first ambiance. With 5,000 registered users on the platform, they plan to expand and transform the trillion-dollar freelance economy with their hard-to-beat offerings to freelancers and clients. They are doing this by offering a wide range of benefits, like flagging a service fee of 1%, which is small compared to the 15% charged by popular freelance platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. Uwerkwill also provide more security and decentralization to the freelancers by allowing them to transact without needing a third party. Not only is Uwerx focused on creating the best freelance platform there is, but they also plan on rewarding early adopters with a test airdrop of the WERX token after the end of its presale rounds on the 31st of July. After three successful presales, the WERX token sells for $0.041 per token in its stage 5 presale. Uwerx contract has been certified by top auditing firms like SolidProof and InterFi Network, and its WERX token is currently listed on CoinSniper with pending listings on other platforms like Uniswap, CoinGecko, and CoinMarketCap. Uwerx (WERX) Is Set To Break Into the Bull Market In Style Liquidity locking for a set period, renouncing contract ownership, reducing taxes to zero, and incentivizing holders are all markers for cryptos that plan on staying for the long term. These qualities will inevitably benefit Uwerx from the hyper-liquidity that will be deployed during the bull market.

Mallers says the move is part of a two-year effort and will reduce counterparty risk while ensuring the robustness and performance of the company’s products and services. His announcement comes in the wake of bankruptcy rumors about Strike’s former custodian, Prime Trust, which has agreed to sell itself to digital asset custody rival BitGo. Fellow Bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin also recently abandoned Prime Trust.  Read more: Crypto Custody Firm BitGo Reaches Preliminary Agreement to Buy Prime Trust: Sources  Strike declined to comment on the situation surrounding its former custodian, emphasizing that its plan to move custody in-house has been two years in the making. The company’s customer base, spread across more than 65 countries, will now custody bitcoin and fiat directly with Strike.  “I’m proud to announce Strike now owns and operates all of its own infrastructure for customers,” Mallers wrote. “Strike now custodies customer bitcoin and dollars, which means no custodial intermediaries between us and our users.”  Benefits of the transition  Mallers says the transition to in-house custody brings short and long-term benefits to users.  “Because of our infrastructure enhancements, we’ve begun rolling out a lot of awesome new features and capabilities that are now live,” Mallers explained.  Strike users can now send bitcoin directly to other users on a peer-to-peer basis. They can also opt to receive funds as cash or bitcoin. Bitcoin payments can be made directly on-chain or via the Bitcoin Lightning Network – a second layer payment system for cheaper and faster bitcoin transactions.  Deposit limits have been increased and on-chain payments are now tiered, allowing users to pay higher fees for faster payments and lower fees for slower, less urgent transactions.  The 29-year-old says his company has “some serious ambitions” in the long-term.  “Global on/off ramps, instant withdrawals, new DCA [dollar cost averaging] capabilities, continuing to improve our limits, more cross-currency capabilities, and more things we hope to bring soon,” Mallers said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/09/bitcoin-payments-firm-strike-moves-custody-in-house-after-ditching-third-party-services,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6dc9733603ef45f0bfe0fe134b0142de8cc25553-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

RIOT Blockchain's recent doubling of authorized shares suggests no end of dilution in sight, such policy looked counter-intuitive to Bitcoin's limited supply. Shrinking prepaid suggests another round of massive dilution incoming. RIOT's 2023 Q1 all-in mining cost per Bitcoin came in at $46,200, while Bitcoin has to trade above $67,915 to justify its $1.86bn market cap. Introduction: RIOT's 'Debt-Ceiling'-Equivalent Crisis In our previous article , we established that different miners adopted different capital structures to stay afloat amid Bitcoin's pessimistic performance. Some Bitcoin miners like CleanSpark ( CLSK ) aggressively sell Bitcoins mined to cover expenses; miners like Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) take on debt; other miners like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) finance operations through equity (dilution). Because of this, we think it is very important that investors pay attention to the implication of RIOT's recent doubling of the number of Authorized Shares. This is pretty much equivalent to "" increasing the debt ceiling "" (although the former is equity, the latter is a liability). Should dilution continue, this will cause a major headwind to RIOT's upside potential. On the 11th of July 2022, RIOT announced the increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance: ... recommended that the Company's stockholders vote FOR Proposal No. 4, to increase the number of authorized shares of Riot Blockchain, Inc. common stock, authorized for issuance... The Board of Directors of Riot Blockchain UNANIMOUSLY recommends that Riot Blockchain stockholders vote FOR all proposals. As a result, RIOT's authorized shares have doubled from 170mil to 340mil . Given RIOT's policy to dilute shareholders instead of taking on liability, we do not think that the terminal authorized shares will only be 340mil in the future, even though a Bitcoin price rebound might slow the rate of dilution. From the perspective of business strategy, this move indeed secured RIOT some flexibility to expand mining capacity to survive this capital-intensive business. On the flip side, we felt that this move is more beneficial to the talents and executives of RIOT rather than the shareholder. Let us explain. RIOT's 3 NOs No End to Dilution: The Defiance of Limited Supply The Bitcoin mining business is a very capital-intensive business. Depreciation of the Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) remains one of the primary costs of mining Bitcoin. Moreover, The average mining rig lifespan is 3-5 years. After which the mining rigs are worn out or become obsolete (not profitable). Table 1. RIOT's Depreciation Cost QR Cost of Revenue (Self Mining, $mil) Depreciation ($mil) Administrative (including SBC, $mil) Interest Expense ($mil) Total Expense Depreciation % 2023Q1 21.9 59.34 12.7 3.8 97.74 61% 2022Q4 22.6 37.59 30.8 0 90.99 41% 2022Q3 14.7 26.56 16 0 57.26 46% 2022Q2 18 20.6 10.7 0 49.3 42% 2022Q1 19 14.25 10 0 43.25 33% 2021Q4 15.7 5.536 38.93 0 60.17 9% 2021Q3 13 12.2 40 0 65.2 19% 2021Q2 9.3 5.738 3.5 0 18.54 31% 2021Q1 7.5 2.85 5.5 0 15.85 18% Source: Author In addition, the Bitcoin mining sector is highly competitive because the potential mining reward (Bitcoin - BTC-USD ) of one Bitcoin mining company is relative to the mining capacity of its competitor. Bitcoin mining companies compete with one another to gain a larger share of the Bitcoin network. This implies that acquiring more mining rigs (increasing mining capacity) does not guarantee more Bitcoins mined. Therefore, Bitcoin mining companies have to constantly increase their mining capacity just to maintain the same level of production, including RIOT. The increase in authorized shares can help RIOT expand and maintain operations, attract talent, and reward executives: RIOT will have greater flexibility to pursue value-creative opportunities, which may include corporate transactions, public or private offerings of equity securities, and attracting and retaining top talent in a highly competitive market. However, this business mechanics is negative news for RIOT's shareholders because RIOT's prepaid to vendors to secure new mining rigs are close to being exhausted. Table 2 details RIOT's shrinking prepaid. Table 2. RIOT's Shrinking Prepaid QR PP&E ($mil) Prepaid ($mil) 2023Q1 717.3 54.4 2022Q4 692.5 75.03 2022Q3 650.2 200.5 2022Q2 411 376 2022Q1 325 351 2021Q4 263 267 2021Q3 201 95 2021Q2 129 79 2021Q1 28 71 Source: Author RIOT's shrinking prepaid implies RIOT has to raise additional capital to fund the next stage of expansion beyond the guided end-of-2023 12.5 EH/s . Based on RIOT's track record, we expect RIOT to raise capital through equity. This would result in more shareholder dilution. By referring to Table 3, notice that an increase in the sum of prepaid and cash usually coincided with an increase in shares outstanding. In 2021Q4, prepaid and cash positions increased from $95mil to $267mil and $58 to $312mil respectively. During the same period, shares outstanding also increased from 97.2mil to 116.75mil. Similar observations can be made in 2022Q3 as well. Therefore, we expect to see further dilution past 170mil shares outstanding in the near future when RIOT announces the next stage of expansion plans or if Bitcoin continues to trade below RIOT's total mining cost per Bitcoin ($46,200, computed below). Table 3. Increase in Prepaids and Cash Likely Followed By Shareholder Dilution QR PP&E ($mil) Prepaid ($mil) Cash ($mil) Shares Outstanding (mil) 2023Q1 717.3 54.4 158.3 167 2022Q4 692.5 75.03 230.3 167.75 2022Q3 650.2 200.5 255 167.3 2022Q2 411 376 270 148 2022Q1 325 351 113.5 117.3 2021Q4 263 267 312 116.75 2021Q3 201 95 58 97.2 2021Q2 129 79 147 95.95 2021Q1 28 71 241 84.12 Source: Author No Guidance Beyond 12.5 EH/s and 2023 To our knowledge, aside from the Rockdale Facility and Corsicana Facility, RIOT has not guided investors on future expansion plans beyond 12.5 EH/s. Without guidance, analysts won't be able to extrapolate future profitability. What we need to know is whether RIOT's rate of expansion can keep up with the growing Bitcoin network hash rate and the resulting mining difficulty. According to Figure 1 and Figure 2, the Bitcoin network hash rate and mining difficulty were growing at 87% CAGR in the past 2 years. If RIOT's expansion plan cannot match the Bitcoin network growth rate, RIOT's Bitcoin will likely suffer. Due to a lack of guidance, we will model RIOT's profitability and valuation based on the end-of-2023 12.5 EH/s mining capacity. Our model suggests that Bitcoin has to trade above $67,915 to justify RIOT's current market cap of $1.86bn, assuming a 5x earnings multiple (derive from equipment average lifespan), $46,200 total mining cost per Bitcoin (= ($22mil Self-Mining Cost of Revenue + $59.34mil Depreciation + $12.7mil General Admin + $3.8mil interest expense)/2,115 Bitcoin Mined in Q1), and 7,072 Bitcoin reserve. At $67,915 per Bitcoin, RIOT's mining business net of assets and liability stands at $608mil (= $1,860mil market cap - ($158.3mil cash + $717.3mil PP&E + $54.4mil prepaid + 7,072 Bitcoin reserve * $67,915 - $158.2mil total liability). On the other hand, RIOT's profit per Bitcoin mined would be $21,700. At 12.5 EH/s and 87% Bitcoin network CAGR, RIOT is expected to mine 5,600 Bitcoin annually, or $121.6mil. At 5x earnings multiple, RIOT's mining business would be worth $608mil. Even though RIOT may be overpriced now, it is more likely for RIOT to retain this premium and track the Bitcoin price than to decline simply due to fundamentals. Considering RIOT's severe shareholder dilution problem, we recommend prospective investors time their entry to trade the Beta. This is also because RIOT is more volatile than Bitcoin. Figure 1 Data by YCharts Figure 2 Data by YCharts No Strong Catalyst Until Bitcoin Halving 2024 We've previously established our investment thesis for Bitcoin following its 4-year halving cycle. Following the thesis, the current cycle began with a 1-year bull market in May 2020, followed by a 1-1.5 yrs of bear market. Currently, we're in the 2-year recovery phase, where Bitcoin should gradually recover back to its all-time high. Although Bitcoin did not arrive at our predicted $10,000 price level during the bear market, Bitcoin followed through on 4 out of the 5 predicted sequences of action. We noted the path to $10,000 will be difficult because the halving cycle dictates Bitcoin cannot fall below the previous all-time high (~$20,000). Hence, we missed our opportunity to load up at $16,000. So why isn't the recovery phase a strong catalyst for RIOT? This is because we do not know the distribution of the Bitcoin price. If Bitcoin trade mostly below RIOT's total mining cost per Bitcoin, shareholders risk severe dilution. RIOT's 2023 Q1 total mining cost per Bitcoin stands at $46,200. The average total mining cost per Bitcoin is $41,700 over the past 9 quarters. Two other headwinds that could negate upside potential during this Bitcoin recovery phase include a potential large-scale equity offering for the next stage of the expansion plan and potential selling pressure from all the previously issued shares. Table 4. RIOT's All-in Total Mining Cost per BTC QR Total Mining Cost per BTC 2023Q1 46,200 2022Q4 53,000 2022Q3 55,000 2022Q2 35,300 2022Q1 30,800 2021Q4 44,400 2021Q3 50,500 2021Q2 27,500 2021Q1 32,300 Source: Author Verdict In our opinion, RIOT's policy of continuously increasing outstanding shares and authorized shares goes against the motivation for investing in Bitcoin. Isn't Bitcoin's limited supply its key attraction? If so, why risk getting diluted by RIOT? Furthermore, RIOT's operation and business management aren't as efficient and lean as MARA's.

IC1101, named after its astronomical designation, shines with infinite, mysterious light in the vast universe. As one of the largest known galaxies in the universe, IC1101 represents a huge, mysterious, and spectacular existence. It undoubtedly contains endless wonders and unknowns waiting for human exploration. IC1101 is a mysterious galaxy, a new metaverse project name, and a super immersive multi-dimensional universe platform dedicated to providing a more immersive, fun, and autonomous experience than the current metaverse. Participants will be able to explore the mysterious qualities of IC1101 and discover endless possibilities within it. Current metaverse projects often have limitations in terms of graphics, immersion, and participant decision-making power. IC1101 aims to solve these limitations and take the realism, participation, and activity of the metaverse world to a new level. So, can it stand out in fierce competition and become a dark horse? Let us embark on the journey of IC1101 together, explore this mysterious galaxy, and find the answers. When Adventure Meets Creativity In the world of the metaverse, a fascinating worldview is particularly important: it not only determines the style of the project and the immersion of the players, but also opens up more imagination space for storytelling. As a galaxy full of wonders and fantasies, IC1101 has a unique and captivating worldview, bringing unprecedented experiences to participants. The worldview of IC1101 is based on diversity and freedom. Eight major races converge in this galaxy, each with unique appearances and abilities. From appearance to cultural customs, from ideological concepts to social structures, the differences between races in IC1101 are rich and inclusive. In this galaxy, players will be able to explore the blending and mutual influence of diverse cultures, and feel the interaction and cooperation between different races. IC1101 also provides players with great freedom and creativity. Players can choose their own role identity, create unique appearance and personality traits, and participate in various exciting activities and scenarios, such as driving spaceships to explore unknown planets in the galaxy, discovering hidden cosmic secrets; They can also join teams, collaborate to solve complex puzzles and tasks, and experience the fruits of cooperation and unity. At the same time, players can also trade in the economic market of IC1101, buying and selling various precious resources and items, and developing their own wealth and power. Overall, IC1101 combines elements of science fiction, fantasy, and mystery. Players will find themselves in a colorful and mysterious interstellar world, where every exploration and adventure brings new surprises and challenges. But how will this worldview be realized through technology? Multi-platform support attracts different user groups. Overall, IC1101 is an immersive metaverse platform based on a multi-chain architecture that allows users from different public chains to easily connect. Through the introduction of token economics and NFTs, users can have their own digital assets and ownership, and can engage in social and game cooperation to complete tasks, satisfy their desires, and earn rewards. IC1101's appeal is not just in its technological innovation and diverse universe construction, but more importantly, in its ability to attract different types of user groups. Before introducing specific products and technologies, it is worth considering who will be interested in the metaverse. We can divide IC1101's audience into two categories, heavy gamers and casual gamers. The former includes tech enthusiasts and gamers who have some technical expertise and equipment requirements, are interested in immersive virtual experiences, and pursue the ultimate experience; while the latter are more focused on commercial and social aspects, such as enterprises or projects interested in Web3 business models, and players who want to find more social opportunities and new friends in the virtual world. Based on the needs of different user groups, IC1101 provides two products to meet their expectations: IC1101 World and IC1101 Space. IC1101 World: A more immersive metaverse world. IC1101 World is a more immersive metaverse world. In terms of technology and graphics, it is created using the Unreal Engine 5, with outstanding image quality that forms a strong contrast to most of the current metaverse projects made with the Unity engine, which tend to be low-poly in style. In actual gameplay experience, we can see finely detailed graphics similar to those of AAA games, including finely detailed building details, dynamic blur during movement, and reflection of ripples on the water surface, all of which make players feel fully immersed in a virtual world. In terms of scene design, IC1101 World provides more three-dimensional scenes, including different planets and buildings. Each planet has a unique theme and function, such as planets specifically designed for battles and planets for exhibitions and demonstrations. Different buildings also serve different purposes, such as Sony's music hall, which can be used for music playback and related artist activities. In terms of scene design, IC1101 World offers more three-dimensional scenes, including different planets and buildings. Each planet has a unique theme and function, such as planets specifically designed for battles and planets for exhibitions and demonstrations. Different buildings also have different functions, such as Sony's music hall, which can be used for music playback and artist-related activities. In addition, virtual assets have been mapped more realistically in the IC1101 World, and players can directly view and purchase NFTs in the mall, change outfits, and become a 3D image of the NFT, which also provides possibilities for more collaborative creation. IC1101 Space: Lower Threshold for Participation IC1101 World will bring better graphics and a more immersive world to players, but the cost is higher hardware requirements for accessing devices. A well-configured computer may be needed to smoothly enter the metaverse. However, not everyone is a hardcore gamer or an extreme immersion seeker. For more casual players who want to experience the scenes and interactions of the metaverse, IC1101 provides another option: IC1101 Space. IC1101 Space can be accessed through a simple browser login, presented in the form of a webpage, making it convenient and fast to use. Although the graphics may not be as detailed as the World version, they significantly lower the barrier to entry, making them particularly suitable for commercial and social users. In IC1101 Space, players can take on their own roles and participate in online displays and interactions. Compared to traditional social media platforms, IC1101 Space provides richer ways of interaction. In the same scene, players can communicate and greet others, have deeper interactions with organizations, media, and partners they are interested in, bringing them closer together. Immersion is not the first choice for social demand orientation, as it is more important to allow more people to participate in the activities together. IC1101 has achieved this very well. It is worth mentioning that the user data and scenes of the two versions, IC1101 World and IC1101 Space, are interoperable. This means that users can choose different login methods according to their own needs, but their behavior is visible in both versions, and together they influence the world of IC1101. This versioning method for different user groups can attract more users and provide better experiences for different types of participants. This is relatively rare in current metaverse projects, and many projects may not have considered this layered demand. For hardcore players and explorers who are looking for ultimate graphics and immersion, IC1101 World provides a more immersive metaverse experience. For casual players who want to participate in metaverse social and business activities, IC1101 Space provides a lower threshold for participation. Whether for technology enthusiasts, gamers, business users, or social users, IC1101 can meet their needs and create new digital experiences and lifestyles for them. A sense of participation puts the galaxy within reach. The essence of social interaction is a sense of participation. People are the sum of social relationships, and in many metaverse projects, simple display and gathering are only a one-way and low-interaction social relationships, which cannot give players a strong sense of participation. Over time, players will feel empty and boring, and a rich and fulfilling virtual world seems out of reach. Therefore, the metaverse also needs to be built around a sense of participation, so that users are willing, good at, and immersed in this virtual world, becoming ""digital natives"" in the metaverse. In addition to excellent graphics and sensitive user segmentation, IC1101 is also working on a sense of participation. Firstly, in terms of social aspects, in IC1101, users can enter with their own NFT digital avatars, and can also use these avatars within IC1101. This way, users can communicate with others in the virtual world through their digital avatars. Through functions such as lobby chat, private chat, friend teaming, community tasks/activities, live streaming, and social media sharing, users can establish emotional connections with others. In addition, users can also enhance friendships by sending friends gifts. These social functions not only allow users to display their digital avatars in IC1101, but also to establish real social relationships with others. Next, let's delve into the gaming aspect. IC1101 is committed to creating interactive gaming spaces. In the world of IC1101, users can indulge in a wide variety of casual games, enticing more Web2 multi-users to migrate to the Web3 world. With diverse gaming experiences, IC1101 offers users more interactive and entertaining choices, allowing them to have a stronger sense of engagement within the game. In addition, IC1101 provides a whole new shopping experience. Users can present and sell 2D NFTs purchased on other platforms in a 3D manner within IC1101. Furthermore, brand collaborations are able to bring users a shopping experience beyond reality. By partnering with brands, IC1101 has created a 3D NFT digital mall, offering users a completely new way of shopping and experiencing. Finally, IC1101 also allows users to participate in scenario decision-making. Users can vote to decide the functions of buildings and scenes implemented in the metaverse world. This way, users can participate in the construction process of the metaverse, express their opinions and ideas, and further enhance their sense of participation in IC1101. Expert Team The project members of IC1101 are a group of creative industry experts with an average of 15 years of experience in their respective fields. The team members are located in North America and Asia, and have worked for globally renowned companies such as Dfinity, UBISOFT, Disney, Unity SF, and Konami. They have had long-standing partnerships with top global companies such as Blizzard, EA, Sony, and Amazon, and have participated in the development of many well-known products such as Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Harry Potter, New World, and The Last of Us. The team members have a great passion for the Metaverse project and a deep understanding of it. They are familiar with the concept and development trends of the Metaverse, and are committed to creating an exciting and meaningful virtual experience for users. The strength and partnerships of the IC1101 team have laid a solid foundation for the success of the project. Their professional knowledge and rich experience will ensure that IC1101 can provide the best technical solutions and continuously drive the development of the Metaverse. The team's goal is to create a realistic and engaging virtual world for users where everyone can experience unlimited possibilities and fun. SPACE X 3.0: Immerse Yourself in the Advanced Metaverse Even before its official launch, IC1101 offers a unique opportunity for an early experience that everyone has been eagerly waiting for. On June 6th, starting at 10:00 AM, IC1101 is hosting a significant event called ""SPACE X 3.0"" Demo Day, providing a vital chance for those interested in the project. This event will showcase the latest developments of the IC1101 project and allow participants to have a firsthand experience of its remarkable products. ""SPACE X 3.0"" Demo Day will take place in IC1101 Space. Participants will enter this metaverse in the form of digital avatars and engage in interactions with others. The event will offer a diverse range of experiences, including airdrops of tokens and real-time PvP competitions. From the scenes of the event, it's apparent that the inaugural Demo Day has attracted thousands of visitors and garnered support from 30 VCs and 8 media outlets. This demonstrates the convenience, immersion, and engagement that IC1101 provides to its participants. Beyond the event itself, we are also highly excited about the future of the IC1101 project. Through the showcase at Demo Day, IC1101 will unveil its enormous potential and prospects as a real metaverse to the world, bringing users more innovation and thrilling experiences.

42393383,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTI7p,1686332498,The New Crypto Bill Gary Gensler Doesn’t Want You to Know About,"When Gary Gensler’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week filed securities charges against America’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, they were premised on a single core idea: that U.S. law already includes the necessary tools to regulate cryptocurrency assets and marketplaces. Gensler, an appointee of the Biden administration, has consistently repeated that crypto doesn’t need new rules.  But legislators from both the House and Senate, and belonging to both political parties, seem to disagree. A series of recent bills show the legislative branch actively engaged in lawmaking around crypto – they clearly don’t agree that the status quo is good enough. According to one legal theory based on a law known as the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), the existence of this process could undermine the SEC’s current round of enforcement actions, particularly the case against Coinbase.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  On June 2, just days before the SEC actions, House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC) and Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn Thomspon (R-PA) released a collaborative draft bill called the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act. The bill has some truly excellent provisions, including a safe harbor for non-security cryptos under $75 million market cap, and for limited sales to non-accredited investors. It also aims to clarify registration procedures for crypto exchanges, and even includes a plan for “progressive decentralization” that would allow assets to transition from security to commodity status over time.  These specifics are bad for the SEC’s case against Coinbase, since they address many of the precise issues the SEC claims the law already covers. But the bill’s very existence may be an even bigger problem for Gensler than its details, both legally and in the court of public opinion. The bill demonstrates an ongoing process of crypto market legislation, creating at least the appearance that Gensler is trying an end-run around Congress.  Though the House bill is largely a Republican effort, Senator Cyntha Lummis (R-WY) told The Block that she and Senator Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY) are holding the reintroduction of their own crypto regulation bill to see how things go in the House. So it’s not a huge stretch to say that Gary Gensler’s SEC is attempting to sneak past a bipartisan process unfolding across the House and Senate. (The fact that neither version is likely to pass under a Biden administration doesn’t change that.)  This could rise to the level of violating a 1946 law called the Administrative Procedures Act. The APA was crafted, over more than a decade, in an attempt to reconcile the growing administrative state with democratic principles. President Franklin Roosevelt warned at the time that the growth of bureaucratic U.S. agencies ""threatens to develop a fourth branch of government for which there is no sanction in the Constitution."" Broadly, the goal of the APA is to ensure that agencies like the SEC remain subordinate to democratic lawmaking processes.  There is other evidence that the SEC is behaving not just unfairly, but undemocratically. On Wednesday, Robinhood officials testified that they had spent 16 months working with the SEC to register the company’s crypto sales service as a special purpose digital asset broker-dealer. According to their counsel, a former SEC commissioner himself, they were “pretty summarily told in March … that we would not see any fruits of that effort.”  That gets to the deep question about Gensler’s representations over the past two years. While he has on multiple occasions repeated some version of “these companies just need to come in and register,” it now appears that may simply have been a lie.  See also: U.S. Doesn't 'Need More Digital Currency' Because It Has the Dollar, Says SEC's Gensler  The preponderance of evidence, as argued this week by Blockchain Association Chief Policy Officer Jake Chervinsky among others, suggests Gensler’s real goal is to effectively ban crypto in the U.S. In fact, Gensler’s intent or mindstate seem fairly irrelevant – the effects of his and his agency’s actions, if uncontested, could ultimately be the elimination of not just crypto businesses and development, but ultimately even its practical usability by individuals on United States soil.  Given the apparent interest of elected U.S. representatives in a more measured approach, it seems clear that Gensler’s SEC is overstepping its moral authority. It will be up to the courts to determine the legalities.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

13659202,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537202,1686331847,"Avalanche Approaches Vital Support Level, What Comes Next?","Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced a bearish trend over the past few months, particularly after being rejected from the $17.50 price level. This rejection has allowed the bears to exert significant control over the price. In the last 24 hours, AVAX made a slight upward movement of 0.5%. On the weekly chart, it has lost approximately 3.5% of its value. With the technical outlook on the daily timeframe, the bears have an advantage. Both demand and accumulation indicators remain low on the chart, indicating a decrease in buying strength. Related Reading: Bearish BNB Signs Hint Downtrend May Persist Beyond Expectations It is worth noting that the recent volatility displayed by Bitcoin has influenced the price patterns of many altcoins, including AVAX. In order for altcoins like AVAX to surpass their immediate resistance levels, Bitcoin needs to stay above the $26,000 price mark. Presently, AVAX is trading close to a critical support level. If sellers exert more pressure, the altcoin may experience a significant decline in value. The decrease in market capitalization for AVAX indicates a lower buying strength in the market. Avalanche Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, AVAX was trading at $13.90. The coin faces an overhead resistance at $14, and if it manages to surpass this level, it is likely to encounter strong resistance at $14.20. On the downside, if the price falls from its current level, it may break below the support mark at $13.80. This may lead the altcoin to trade near the $13.50 price level. The trading volume of AVAX in the last session was low, indicating that sellers still have an advantage in the market. Technical Analysis During the months of May and towards the end of April, AVAX experienced low buying strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated that sellers had control over the price, as the RSI remained below the half-line and showed a downward trend at the time of writing. Additionally, the price moved below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), suggesting low demand and indicating that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. If the price of AVAX attempts to rise above the $14 mark, it is expected that demand will return to the market. In line with other technical indicators, AVAX has shown reduced buying signals, indicating a downtrend. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a momentum indicator that helps identify price reversals. In the case of AVAX, it displayed declining green histograms, suggesting diminishing buy signals. Related Reading: MATIC Price Shows Bullish Formation – What’s Next? The Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility and fluctuations, tightened at the time of writing. This tightening indicates that there is a possibility of increased volatility in the price of AVAX in the upcoming trading sessions.

42393391,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTIXT,1686329930,The SEC Has Started an All-In Political Battle Over Crypto,"The Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase this week have set up a high-stakes battle that will engage all three branches of the U.S. government in a competition for power, determine whether the crypto industry will decamp the U.S. for good, and define the future of digital money.  The SEC’s aggressive actions against Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, and Coinbase, the biggest in the U.S., are a big flex, one that reveals the agency’s extraordinary discretionary power. In saying “we don’t need more digital currency” in interviews following the announcements, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler suggested he truly does want to destroy the crypto industry.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  By throwing the book at Binance, a thoroughly international company, and its high-profile CEO, Changpeng Zhao (“CZ”), with a suit that, among other claims, alleges that it offered unregistered securities and commingled customer funds, the SEC has sought to demonstrate that its reach extends beyond U.S. borders.  And with the Coinbase case it is, quite clearly, taking aim at a much wider set of players than just that one defendant. The case is premised on the notion that most of the securities traded on the San Francisco-based exchange are unregistered securities, creating legal concerns for the likes of Algorand, Polygon and Solana. The actions directly go after the centralized finance (CeFi) system on which Binance’s and Coinbase’s custodial models are based and, indirectly, some of the main protocols on which decentralized finance (DeFi) depends.  But this is far from a slam-dunk for the SEC. For one, the cases likely won’t be decided or settled for many years – if the SEC’s three-year-old case against Ripple Labs is any indication. Both Coinbase and Binance are vowing to fight hard in court, which will leave the Commission’s resource-challenged enforcement team stretched under a massive workload.  And the SEC’s hardline approach does not enjoy widespread support in other areas of the U.S. government. The timing of these actions being what it is, the agency is almost willing other bases of power to come after it.  Other branches of government, other ideas  To start with: Congress.  A draft bill that will soon come before the House sets parameters for how to classify digital assets and circumscribes the SEC’s powers of interpretation of crypto within existing securities law, curtailing its capacity to launch these kinds of enforcement actions. It is co-sponsored by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chair of the House financial services committee, who has been critical of Gensler’s aggressive actions against the crypto industry, and Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), the chair of the agriculture committee, which has jurisdiction over the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the other big agency vying for a greater say in crypto regulation.  Whether the McHenry-Thompson bill gets through a Democrat-controlled Senate and eventually makes it into law is doubtful within the current electoral term, but the proposed legislation makes for a very important talking point as the election season ramps up.  That brings us to a second branch of government: the executive, within whose authority the SEC and other such agencies fall. These lawsuits will land into a presidential campaign in which the future of crypto and digital assets will, like never before, be part of the public debate.  Already, expressions of support for crypto have come from three Presidential hopefuls: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination; Florida Governor Ron De Santis, seen as the main challenger to former President and third-go-round candidate Donald Trump, and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, another Republican contender. Trump, until now the Republican frontrunner, has himself used non-fungible tokens as fundraising vehicles, though his pronouncements on crypto have been all over the shop.( Of course, his indictment on federal charges Thursday evening raises big questions around his candidacy.)  Read more: David Z. Morris - The SEC Is Fighting the Last War  Whether or not Biden retains the presidency, this level of attention on the industry will help shape the politics of how a future SEC deals with these cases.  Then there’s the Supreme Court, which last month scaled back the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to enforce rules on landowners based on the Clean Water Act. What does this have to do with the SEC and crypto? Conservatives, who now control the court, see the EPA as just the first regulatory agency whose authority needs to be clipped. A more sweeping attack on executive agencies is coming, and the SEC is likely to be a target.  In other words, a perfect political storm is brewing that makes the outcome of this current war on crypto hard to predict.  What next?  The multi-front nature of this fight also raises the stakes in that outcome, even if we have to wait years to see it.  If the Gensler strategy of all-out attack wins, it could be the de facto death knell for crypto in the U.S. Developers will leave en masse to set up shop in Dubai, or Bermuda, or Singapore, or France, or in any number of jurisdictions that are proactively developing regulatory guardrails for crypto innovation to occur.  This is not to say certain bank-licensed stablecoin ideas or real-world asset tokenization strategies led by existing, regulated institutions and public companies, won’t be allowed or even encouraged in the U.S. But since these would struggle to interface with the permissionless architecture of prohibited “crypto” blockchains, an outdated U.S. capital market might struggle to compete with the new models of programmable money and decentralized governance being fostered elsewhere.  But this is far from a slam-dunk for the SEC  Alternatively, the passage of time and the mounting counteroffensive from crypto’s supporters in Congress and in the courts could quash this wave of attacks. But to what end? If such a victory just further entrenches politicization and partisanship around this issue, the bigger, most important battle – for mainstream acceptance and adoption – will still need to be fought.  What’s needed – for all of our peace of mind – is for the crypto topic to transcend politics. It would be nice to think that this would happen organically because, after all, this is a technology – it should be apolitical. But, sadly, it’s going to be up to the crypto community to engineer. There should be a focus on education efforts, which show real use cases and demonstrate the benefits to humanity from this industry’s approach to decentralized value exchange and data-sharing.  We must try to ignore the theater in Washington, not to disengage with the political process but to figure out how to do so in a way that can appeal to both sides.  A part of that is to focus on a positive narrative. Surely, in an age of great uncertainty around climate, geopolitical tensions and the encroachment of artificial intelligence into society, there’d be a market – on both sides of the political aisle – for such a story.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALGO | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Michael J.

13657732,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537204,1686327915,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price At The Most Crucial Point In Its History?,"After Shiba Inu (SHIB) had a fabulous rally at the beginning of the year, the price has been in a sustained downturn since February 5, which neither the beta launch of Shibarium nor an increase in monthly burn rates were able to prevent. With the price currently trading at $0.00000804, SHIB is thus at possibly the most important point in its young history. A look at the 1-day chart reveals that SHIB reached a local high of $0.00001575 on February 5, 2023. From that point until early May, the price formed a descending triangle with a horizontal trend line at $0.000010 acting as support for a long time. This price level was also aligned with the 23.6% Fibonacci level. Most Important Moment In Shiba Inu Price History? When the trend line was broken to the downside, the downtrend continued rapidly. All year-to-date gains were wiped out. However, one last hope may now be a triple bottom chart pattern, which the Shiba Inu price is currently exhibiting. The price area at $0.00000776 served as the last support back in mid-June 2022 and late December 2022, and now again. Shiba Inu meets all three characteristics of the chart pattern. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Hits Crucial Barrier – How This May Impact Investor Sentiment First, the three lows must be roughly equal in price and spaced apart by a certain distance (June and December 2022, June 2023). Second, volume must be decreasing throughout the pattern, which is a sign that the bears are losing strength. Looking at the time pattern of SHIB trading volume, this condition can also be considered to be met. Third, Shiba Inu has been in a steady downtrend with lower highs since the all-time high of late October 2021. Hence, the decisive moment might have come now: While the trading volume decreases during downward movements, the volume should increase during upward movements when the price breaks through the resistance levels. Only if that happens, a trend reversal seems possible. A very first resistance to break through is at $0.0000817. If successful, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) currently at $0.00000907 could come into focus. However, probably the most important resistance to confirm a fake breakout is the 23.6% Fibonacci level at $0.000010. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Could Soar To Major Highs Soon, Here’s Why The bullish case of Shiba Inu is also supported by a possible bullish divergence of the RSI in the 1-day chart. This occurs when the RSI indicates an oversold condition (SHIB’s RSI dropped as low as 24 in May), followed by a higher low associated with lower price lows. Thus, the RSI of Shiba Inu price in the 1-day chart could indicate bullish momentum. The break above the oversold zone in recent days could be a signal for a new buy position. But the bearish case is still strong as well. SHIB traders do not want to see a drop below $0.00000716 at any cost. If this happens, it would be an alarming signal that SHIB could test the September 2021 low around $0,000006.

The move comes after the SEC alleged that several crypto tokens are unregistered securities. Robinhood Markets Inc. announced today that it would end support for Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) as of June 27. No Other Coins Will Be Affected The trading app informed users they would no longer be able to trade the tokens on its platform just days after the SEC labelled several popular cryptocurrencies unregistered securities. The regulator made the allegations in a lawsuit against crypto exchange Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. The lawsuit names Cardano, Polygon, Solana, Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Filecoin (FIL), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), The Sandbox (SAND), Coti (COTI), and Axie Infinity (AXS). The suit also identified the BUSD and BNB stablecoins as securities. Robinhood limited its delisting to SOL, ADA, and MATIC and said to users that no other coins would be affected and would remain safe on its platform. It had been reported that the trading app would review its cryptocurrency offerings. On Tuesday, the company’s chief legal officer, Dan Gallagher, told Congress that it is “actively reviewing” the SEC’s analysis “to determine what if any, action to take.” Gallagher, a former SEC commissioner, testified before the House Agriculture Committee during a meeting on digital assets. SEC Sparkes Chaos in the Crypto Market The securities agency filed lawsuits against two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges – Binance and Coinbase. According to the SEC, Binance mishandled customer funds and deceived investors and regulators about its operations. It further alleged that both Zhao and the exchange failed to restrict US customers from its platform and charged Binance with operating as an unregistered securities exchange. The agency filed suit against Binance’s rival platform, Coinbase, accusing the exchange of acting as an unregistered broker, exchange, and clearinghouse. The SEC charged Coinbase for “the unregistered offer and sale of securities in connection with its staking-as-a-service program.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42393392,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTIhj,1686326700,"Louis Vuitton’s Soulbound Luxury NFTs, Apple’s Expensive Vision","This week, Louis Vuitton announced a new collection of physical-backed NFTs linked to exclusive products and experiences. The pricey tokens are soulbound and cannot be sold once purchased.  Meanwhile, Apple announced its new Vision Pro headset with a hefty price tag and not a single use of the word metaverse. Plus, NFT lending platforms are on the rise, but who really stands to benefit from this practice?  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  C’est bon, Louis Vuitton: French luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton will soon release a new collection of physical-backed NFTs called Via Treasure Trunks, which will be linked to exclusive experiences and products down the line. Consumers based in the U.S., Canada, France, the U.K., Germany, Japan and Australia can register to obtain the exclusive treasure trunks, which will be made available to select customers on June 16. Each NFT will be priced at €39,000 including tax or $39,000 without tax in the U.S.  Lifelong luxury: The trunks will be sold as soulbound tokens, meaning they are non-transferable once purchased. However, the brand plans to release limited products and experiences “at regular intervals” throughout the year,” which holders can flip for profit.  Blocked by the chain: Louis Vuitton previously embraced blockchain technology as a way to track luxury goods and crack down on counterfeit products.  Blink different: This week, Apple announced its new Vision Pro mixed reality headset, finally entering the growing arena of immersive digital technology. The new device, which it is calling a “spatial computer,” instead of an augmented reality headset, will be released next year to the tune of $3,500. The device will introduce VisionOS, a spatial operating system that offers a three-dimensional interface, releasing applications from the boundaries of traditional screens and bringing them into real-world spaces.  Metaverse blueprint: While Apple avoided the term metaverse, it’s likely that Apple has been influenced by competitors like Microsoft and Meta. ""It builds upon theories built by the metaverse industry over the past few years,"" Mytaverse co-founder and CTO Jaime Lopez told CoinDesk.  NFT lending is trending: Despite lackluster market conditions, the NFT lending space has taken off thanks to major players joining the space. In May, leading NFT marketplace Blur launched Blend – a peer-to-peer lending platform that allows users to borrow against their NFTs as collateral. The platform quickly seized 82% of the entire NFT lending market share within its first three weeks. Other platforms – including Binance NFT Loan, which allows holders to secure ETH loans by using their NFTs as collateral, and Astaria, which utilizes a third party to facilitate its lending market – have popularized the concept of NFTfi in recent weeks.  Predatory behavior: While NFTfi tools expand the liquidity of the NFT market, critics urge new traders to understand the consequences before engaging in risky behavior. “[Blend is] pitched as a ‘buy now, pay later’ that uses a perpetual lending on the back end, which is super predatory to the borrower,” Karan Karia, vice president of business development at Wasabi protocol, told CoinDesk.  Projects on the Rise  Stand with Crypto  Who: Coinbase  What: In March, crypto marketplace Coinbase released an open edition, commemorative NFT it called “Stand with Crypto” as a symbol of support for the crypto community during times of hardship like the current SEC crackdown. The blue shield, a symbol that many on crypto Twitter have integrated into their usernames, includes a QR code that Coinbase says will be periodically updated, providing the community with more advocacy opportunities over time. The NFT has recently seen new adoption after news of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suit against Coinbase emerged. Shortly after the news broke, Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted the link to mint the NFT. The suit came a day after the SEC sued Binance.  How: The free-to-mint NFT can be minted through Zora. Any fees associated with the minting process will be donated to vetted organizations through a crypto advocacy round via Gitcoin. The NFT has no intended utility or value.  In Other News  Non-fungible superhero: Warner Bros. is releasing the Superman Web3 Movie Experience, a multimedia NFT collection built around 1978’s “Superman: The Movie.”  Playing the long game: Investments in blockchain games and metaverse projects reached $476 million in May – the highest this year despite shaky market conditions.

In a blog post titled “the Three Transitions,” Buterin wrote that the technical transitions need to be addressed simultaneously, to maintain key components of the protocol while providing a “global and permissionless experience to average users.”  “These three transitions are crucial,” Buterin wrote in the blog post. “But they are also challenging because of the intense coordination involved to properly resolve them.”  Layer 2 scaling  The first component, layer 2 scaling, is crucial as Buterin argues that if Ethereum fails on this front, “every product aiming for the mass market inevitably forgets about the chain and adopts centralized workarounds for everything.”  Ethereum has seen massive growth over the past few months in terms of the number of layer 2 networks, with ZK rollups released by Polygon and Matter Labs.  Ethereum is set later this year to undergo a major upgrade known as Dencun thatwill include a technical feature known as proto-danksharding, aiming to help make rollups cheaper.  Crypto wallet security  The second component, wallet security, which involves moving all users wallets over to smart contract wallets, Buterin argues is needed so that users are comfortable with storing their cryptocurrency payments and data on-chain, otherwise they move over to centralized entities.  Privacy  Buterin also suggests that the final component, privacy, is crucial otherwise “Ethereum fails,” as users will have all their on-chain activity visible to the public.  “It's not just features of the protocol that need to improve; in some cases, the way that we interact with Ethereum needs to change pretty fundamentally, requiring deep changes from applications and wallets,” Buterin writes.

13656464,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537218,1686324623,"Former SEC Chairman Deserves Appreciation From Ripple, Alderoty States","Ripple General Counsel Stuart Alderoty, recently acknowledged the former United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman, Late Harvey Pitt, in a tweet expressing gratitude towards his contribution. He added that Ripple owes a debt of gratitude to Harvey for providing a comprehensive description employed by the SEC to enforce compliance with securities laws. Alderoty further cites Pitt’s argument in the Tetragon vs. Ripple case, stating it is the court’s responsibility, not the commission’s, to decide if an asset qualifies as a security. Alderoty Highlights Pitt’s Report on SEC Lawsuit Process In the tweet, Alderoty added Pitt’s report in the Tetragon Fin. Grp. vs. Ripple lawsuit as an attachment. The Ripple general counsel drew attention to a comment Pitt made regarding the process of an enforcement action conducted by the SEC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Dormant 1,433 BTC Moves After 10+ Years Pitt’s report states an enforcement action begins when the SEC files a lawsuit against an entity in a federal court. He also noted that commissioners that vote to bring an enforcement action are minimally involved once the litigation commences. The former chairman clarified that once the SEC initiates legal proceedings, the commission’s role shifts to that of an advocate for its stance. Also, he emphasized that the court holds the ultimate authority to determine if the asset in question qualifies as a security. For context, Pitt died in Washington on May 30, 2023, at 78 years, due to a sudden illness. He became the SEC Chairperson in 2001 but resigned after 18 months due to various corporate scandals, including the notorious Enron scandal. Notably, Pitt served as the US Securities and Exchange Commission chairman under the reign of President George Bush. SEC vs. Ripple Legal Battle and Controversy Over Crypto Asset Securities It is worth noting that the lawsuit filed against Ripple by the SEC has lasted over two years, resulting in Ripple spending about $200 million to fight back. The SEC accuses Ripple of selling an asset as an unregistered security, while Ripple says the asset should be seen as a digital currency rather than a security. In addition to XRP, the SEC has recently designated various other crypto assets as securities. This list includes ADA, CHZ, SOL, AXS, FIL, ICP, FLOW, NEAR, MATIC, VGX, SAND, DASH, BNB, BUSD, ATOM, MANA, ALGO, and COTI. Following the SEC’s decision to label multiple crypto assets as securities, the commission has encountered several criticisms from the crypto community. SEC Chair Gary Gensler had asserted that most crypto assets, excluding Bitcoin, are considered securities. Nevertheless, Gensler did not explain how he reached this conclusion regarding the legal classification of these “most” cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, in a recent tweet by Alderoty, he said that despite what Gensler said, the Securities and Exchange Commission does not have a magic regulatory wand to convert any token to securities. He added that he’s looking forward to how the Congress and Courts will follow up the case.

Three must-implement transitions Buterin emphasises that these transitions, namely Layer 2 scaling, wallet security enhancement, and privacy measures, are essential in maintaining Ethereum's decentralised nature and for guaranteeing open and unrestricted access for all users. Failure to implement these transitions, warns Buterin, could potentially undermine Ethereum's viability as a robust and widely adopted platform. Layer 2 scaling The first transition focuses on scaling Layer 2 solutions. Over the past few years, Ethereum has witnessed the emergence of a Layer 2 ecosystem comprising solutions like Optimistic Rollup and Zero Knowledge-Rollup, which have effectively reduced transaction costs. However, as the majority of activities still occur on the main Ethereum network, further maturation and scaling of the Layer 2 space are necessary. Buterin highlights the potential consequences of neglecting Layer 2 scaling, including skyrocketing transaction fees during market expansion phases or bullish market trends. Such circumstances may lead users to seek centralised alternatives, posing a threat to Ethereum's decentralisation goals. ""The absence of the first transition, Layer 2 scaling, would render Ethereum vulnerable, with each transaction costing $3.75 ($82.48 during a bullish market). This would inevitably drive mass-market products to disregard the Ethereum chain and adopt centralized workarounds,"" Buterin explained. Wallet security The second transition highlighted by Buterin centres around wallet security. Buterin expresses concern that potential security risks may discourage users from storing their funds and non-financial assets on the Ethereum network, driving them towards centralised exchanges as a safer alternative. ""Without the second transition, wallet security, Ethereum's success is compromised as users become hesitant to store their funds securely. This could result in a mass migration towards centralized exchanges,"" warns Buterin. To enhance wallet security, Buterin proposes a shift towards smart contract wallets with advanced features such as social recovery, similar to the concept of account abstraction. These enhanced wallets would offer improved security measures and an enhanced user experience. Privacy The third and final transition emphasised by Buterin is privacy. He cautions that the absence of robust data privacy measures may discourage users from utilising Ethereum's capabilities fully. To address this concern, Buterin suggests the implementation of stealth address protocols, which would provide privacy features for Ethereum users. By integrating stealth address protocols, Ethereum would be able to offer enhanced privacy options, attracting users who value anonymity and data protection.

Gox's wallets around September 2011, the DOJ said in a press release Friday announcing the unsealing of a 2019 indictment, stealing 647,000 BTC over the course of nearly three years. These funds were then laundered.  The DOJ alleged that Bilyuchenko was also an operator of defunct crypto exchange BTC-e, alongside Alexander Vinnick who was previously charged with operating BTC-e.  The DOJ also unsealed a 2016 filing focused on BTC-e, which has long been linked to funds laundered from the Mt. Gox theft.  Both face charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, while Bilyuchenko also faces a charge of operating an unlicensed money services business. The DOJ's Southern District of New York and Northern District of California offices both brought cases tied to the Mt. Gox hack.  Mt. Gox halted transactions in February 2014, shortly after Messari founder Ryan Selkis published an internal document suggesting it had lost nearly 750,000 BTC.  In a statement, DOJ Assistant Attorney Kenneth Polite said called the unsealing an important milestone.  ""As alleged in the indictments, starting in 2011, Bilyuchenko and Verner stole a massive amount of cryptocurrency from Mt. Gox, contributing to the exchange’s ultimate insolvency,"" he said. ""Armed with the ill-gotten gains from Mt. Gox, Bilyuchenko allegedly went on to help set up the notorious BTC-e virtual currency exchange, which laundered funds for cyber criminals worldwide.""

Gox – Why Bitcoin’s Greatest Hack Still Matters  The DOJ also alleged that Bilyuchenko, Verner and other unnamed co-conspirators used an unnamed New York-based bitcoin brokerage service to launder funds, ultimately moving over $6.6 million into ""overseas bank accounts.""  The brokerage helped launder over 300,000 BTC, the DOJ alleged.  The documents further alleged that the defendants sent the funds to both BTC-e and TradeHill, another defunct exchange.

42393387,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTISL,1686322878,"With Ether Options Market Makers 'Long Gamma' at $1.8K, Price Is Likely to Hold","Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market value, has been largely locked in a narrow price range around $1,800 since mid-May and is unlikely to move much in the short term, market makers' positions in the options market indicate.  That's because the market makers, the dealers tasked with providing liquidity to an exchange's order book and who are always on the opposite side of investors' bets, are forced to hedge their options exposure through offsetting positions in the spot or futures market in order to run a market-neutral, or delta-neutral, portfolio. Their so-called delta hedging actions as the underlying asset moves can influence the spot market price and are known to arrest price swings.  According to Jeff Anderson, a senior trader at STS Digital, market makers are currently stuffed with what's known as long gamma positions in the $1,800 strike price ether options due to expire on June 30. Market makers are said to be long gamma at a particular price level when they have bought options at that level.  ""So, as we go higher, market makers will likely sell ETH. On the flip side, market makers would buy the cryptocurrency on price dips,"" Anderson told CoinDesk. ""So, the spot price could stay close to $1,800.""  Options are contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to trade the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy while put the put option offers the right to sell. Being long gamma means holding a buy position in call or put options.  The long gamma positioning forces market makers to snap up the underlying asset when the price falls below the said level to keep the overall portfolio market-neutral. Similarly, they sell the asset when the price rallies. Gamma refers to the rate of change in options delta per one-point move in the underlying asset.  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said the delta hedging by market makers could strongly influence the spot price.  ""Considering the lack of enthusiasm among futures and perpetual futures traders right now, the impact of market maker hedging could be significant,"" Ardern said.

42393376,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTHiB,1686321572,Curve Finance CEO Egorov Sued by 3 DeFi-Focused Venture Capital Firms,"Michael Egorov, the CEO of decentralized finance (DeFi) firm Curve Finance, is being sued for fraud by venture capital firms ParaFi Capital, Framework Ventures and 1kx in the U.S.  A complaint filed in the Superior Court of California, San Francisco, alleges Egorov misappropriated trade secrets of the three VC firms, and defrauded the firms out of close to $1 million in funds while dangling the false promise of a possible stake in Curve to gain the investors’ trust and support.  The lawsuit, filed in April, also alleges that Egorov moved to Switzerland to insulate himself from the inevitable legal fallout. The three firms have been pursuing a breach-of-contract case in Switzerland against Egorov and his company Swiss Stake since 2020.  Curve Finance, a decentralized exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain, ranks among the biggest DeFi trading platforms, with some $4.07 billion in total locked value, according to DeFi Llama. Curve operates in the form of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), controlled by the CRV token, which can be bought or earned by contributing to Curve’s liquidity pools.  Beginning in early 2020, Framework Ventures, ParaFi Capital and 1kx claim that Egorov “engaged in a brazen, multi-faceted scheme to defraud” them over a six-month period, according to the complaint. The VCs also allege Egorov “misappropriated” the firms’ “trade secrets,” including “information that proved to be critical to the development of Curve, such as key industry contacts, potential investors, and knowledge of how to manage an investment round – all while falsely promising that Plaintiffs would benefit from the fruits of their labor, not just Egorov.”  The VC’s also claim Egorov offered to sell shares of Swiss Stake to Plaintiffs for close to $1 million (alleging that a combined $925,233.54 worth of USDC was sent to a wallet specified by Egorov), but had no intention of transferring shares of Swiss Stake to the firms.  Egorov’s lawyers said in May 22 filing that the allegations of fraud derive from the termination of a contract between the VCs and Swiss Stake, and that the “trade secrets” in question were really the names of widely known investors. Egorov’s side also claims Swiss Stake promptly offered to return the roughly $1 million of invested funds.  “To justify their blatant forum shopping, Plaintiffs concocted a new and compelling story painting Egorov as an evil villain who duped three naïve VC firms into giving up ‘trade secrets,’” according to a May 22 filing by Egorov’s lawyers. The case against Egorov amounts to “nothing more than a clever narrative,” his attorneys said.  Law firm Latham & Watkins, representing the three VC firms provided CoinDesk with a statement via email: “It is regrettable this has reached the point of litigation, but we strongly believe the facts are on our side. In that respect, the complaint speaks for itself. Our clients are resolved to seek full accountability of Michael Egorov for his behavior.”  Egorov’s lawyers, DLA Piper, provided a comment via email after the story was published.  ""Multiple Swiss courts have sided with us several times, reasoning that we were simply following the contract's terms. So ParaFi, Framework, and 1kx are trying again, this time in the US, perhaps to leverage the hostile crypto climate there,"" the lawyers said. ""It was counsel for Parafi that drafted the Agreement they are suing upon—an agreement that literally prohibits filing this suit in California.""",NEGATIVE,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | CRV | ETH | EXCHANGE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/09/curve-finance-ceo-egorov-sued-by-three-defi-focused-venture-capital-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/666e343d7c17f95a49ec89d63498472de4d754c1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Based on our latest review, we’ve decided to end support for Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) on June 27th, 2023 at 6:59 PM ET,"" Robinhood said in a blog post. ""No other coins are affected and your crypto is still safe on Robinhood,"" the post added.  Users are able to continue trading and transfer of the three tokens on the app until the deadline. After support stops on June 27, tokens left in a user’s account will be automatically sold for market value, Robinhood said.  The decision comes as part of the company’s regular review of cryptocurrencies, Robinhood said. However, those were the only tokens that were listed on the trading platform, that were named as securities by the recent SEC lawsuits.  After the delisting, the platform will offer the trading for 15 different crypto currencies, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), dogecoin (DOGE), and avalanche (AVAX) - all of which were not included in the SEC lawsuit as securities.  Robinhood said during a recent industry testimony in the U.S. House of Representatives that it tried to register as a special-purpose broker for digital assets but couldn’t get the SEC to guide the trading platform into crypto compliance, though the agency's staff seemed to want to help.  “When Chair Gensler at the SEC in 2021 said, ‘Come in and register,’ we did,” said Robinhood Markets' chief compliance lawyer Dan Gallagher in his testimony. “We went through a 16-month process with the SEC staff trying to register a special purpose broker dealer. And then we were pretty summarily told in March that that process was over and we would not see any fruits of that effort,” he added.  Both Solana and Cardano have rejected the claims of the tokens being a security, while Polygon declined to comment earlier to CoinDesk about the matter.

13655124,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537195,1686321011,"Crypto Market Tension: ADA, BNB, MATIC, SOL Crash Over 10% In Past Week","In a market heavily influenced by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), their slight price decline recently has been overshadowed by a more substantial fall in larger altcoins. Notably, Cardano (ADA), BNB (BNB), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) have seen a more than 10% drop over the past week. This downturn traces back to regulatory actions taken by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against industry titans Binance and Coinbase. Regulatory Pressure And The Crypto Market This heightened market volatility follows charges laid by the SEC on Tuesday against Coinbase for facilitating the trading of crypto assets they labeled as unregistered securities. The list of implicated assets includes FLOW, VGX, MATIC, and ADA. A similar charge was filed against Binance, where these assets, among others like BNB, BUSD, SOL, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI, were categorized as securities. It’s interesting to note that the SEC did not include tokens with substantial trading volumes such as ETH, USDC, USDT, LTC, and BTC. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, responded to these charges by suggesting that the regulatory crackdown was a move to pave the way for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). In his view, the government aims to leverage the CBDC as a tool to assert control over people’s finances, facilitated by a selection of influential banks. Hoskinson noted: With respect to Binance, I’m reading through the SEC complaint. It’s over 130 pages, but seems like the next in a series of steps to implement chokepoint 2.0 in the United States. The end goal is a agenda based CBDC partnered with a handful of massive banks and end-to-end control over every aspect of your financial life. The Market Impact On ADA, BNB, MATIC, And SOL In the wake of this regulatory scrutiny, ADA’s price has seen a market downtrend, falling by 15% over the past 7 days, with a further 2.8% loss in the past 24 hours alone. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.31, a significant drop from its pre-regulation price. In spite of the price drop, ADA’s trading volume surged from $228 million to over $400 million between last Friday and yesterday, indicating a high sell pressure. It is worth noting that over the past week, more than $2 billion have been subtracted from the asset’s market capitalization. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Declines As Market Recovers Amid Security Charges Similarly, other altcoins such as Polygon (MATIC), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL) have mirrored ADA’s price action. In the past week, MATIC, BNB, and SOL have recorded downward turns of 13.6%, 15.7%, and 11.4% respectively. Notably, among the global crypto market capitalization, ADA currently ranks 8th with SOL and MATIC ranking below Dogecoin (DOGE). Meanwhile, despite the large impact on BNB, the asset still ranks 3rd in the global crypto market. This turbulent market activity, however, underscores the substantial influence of regulatory entities on the cryptocurrency market.

Earlier this week, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced tighter advertising rules for the crypto industry, which will take force on October 8. Giving away free NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and cryptocurrencies via airdrops to encourage users to invest in digital assets will no longer be allowed. Matthew Long, the FCA’s director of payments and digital assets, told media publication CoinDesk, that frequently these NFTs and airdrops when used as promotional products, result in consumers buying crypto that they realise “can be problematic later.” Long added that NFTs and airdrops will not be banned, merely promotions involving them. FCA Classifies Crypto as “Restricted Mass Market Investment” The FCA’s newly published rules categorise crypto as a “restricted mass market investment” and will require firms promoting crypto products or services to introduce clear risk warnings. The regulator also said “refer a friend” bonuses incentivising the public to invest in cryptocurrencies will be banned. The new rules will require a “cooling-off” period for first-time investors to discourage impulsive crypto purchases. Research by the FCA reveals that estimated crypto ownership has more than doubled from 2021 to 2022, with 10% of the 2,000 people surveyed indicating that they own cryptocurrencies. Sheldon Mills, executive director of Consumers and Competition at the FCA, said: It is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto. But research shows many regret making a hasty decision. Our rules give people the time and the right risk warnings to make an informed choice. Consumers should still be aware that crypto remains largely unregulated and high risk. Those who invest should be prepared to lose all their money. FCA Goes Ahead With Tighter Rules Despite Industry Pushback The FCA consulted on its proposed marketing rules in 2022 and found that respondents largely disagreed with rules such as banning incentives, blocking new investors from getting non-real-time promotional offers (DOFP) and treating crypto as a mass market investment. As it stands, only entities that have received authorisation from the FCA can approve their own advertisements. Given that there is no framework currently in place that allows the FCA to authorise crypto firms fully, the government has created a temporary exemption that will enable crypto firms registered with the FCA to comply with its AML requirements to approve their own advertisements starting in October. The measure, as stated, is only temporary, and eventually, only FCA-authorised entities will be permitted to approve ads. Some industry players, however, caution the requirement may be too restrictive. The FCA will go forward with the above measures despite industry pushback.

Despite initial hopes for a swift recovery, the persistence of these bearish signs compels investors to explore the implications and brace for the possibility of a more prolonged downturn, provoking further scrutiny of the future of BNB and its impact on the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. But what exactly are these signals telling us about the future of BNB? Related Reading: ApeCoin Holders Suffer Financial Pain As 95% Endure Negative Returns BNB Recent Downturn Coincides With Surge In Trading Volume According to a recent tweet by Santiment, BNB has experienced a notable downturn of -15% since June 4. The decline in BNB’s price coincided with a surge in its trading volume, reaching a level not seen in the past five weeks. 📉 #BinanceCoin has been hammered compared to the rest of the markets these past couple days. Now -15% since Sunday, social dominance has surged as the asset has become quite polarizing. $BNB trading volume is at 5-week high levels as well. https://t.co/E7sU59lkRe pic.twitter.com/FL0Er5vmQa — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 7, 2023 This increase in trading activity suggests that market participants are actively engaging with BNB during its price decline, possibly seeking buying opportunities or adjusting their positions in response to the market movement. The higher trading volume indicates heightened market interest and the potential for increased price volatility as investors closely monitor BNB’s performance. BNB market cap currently at $40.5 billion. Chart: TradingView.com This confluence of factors, with BNB experiencing a significant decrease in value alongside a surge in trading volume, presents a dynamic and evolving situation for traders and investors, warranting careful attention and analysis of the underlying market dynamics. Amidst the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, BNB’s price on CoinGecko stands at $260.59, reflecting a mere 0.8% drop in the past 24 hours. However, a more concerning trend emerges when we consider its seven-day decline, which amounts to a significant 15.1%. Source: Coingecko Open Interest Up, Whale Transactions Down Adding to the prevailing bearish sentiment surrounding BNB, its chart analysis reveals additional causes for concern. Notably, BNB’s open interest has gained upward momentum, indicating an influx of new or additional capital entering the market. This increase in open interest suggests that the current market trend may persist for a longer period, without any imminent reversal. Source: Coinalyze However, a bearish indication came from the Market Value Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio, which showed a considerable decrease. This decline suggests that the average profit or loss of BNB holders is currently lower, reflecting the downward pressure on the coin’s value. Related Reading: Pepecoin 15% Drop Sparks Speculation: Will Further Pain Follow? In line with the bearish trend, whale interest in BNB has also waned, evident from the decrease in the number of whale transactions. This decline in whale activity signifies a reduced involvement of large-scale investors or entities, potentially adding to the market’s cautious outlook. Furthermore, BNB’s velocity, representing the frequency at which the coin is used in transactions within a given timeframe, registered a decline. This decrease in velocity suggests that BNB is being utilized less frequently for transactions, possibly indicating a decrease in overall market activity.

This corner of the crypto economy uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to remove intermediaries from lending, trading, saving and other financial activities. “Intermediaries” here means not only banks and other financial institutions but also regulators and any gatekeepers.  Yet, for the subsector to continue to grow, attract capital and become a trusted way to conduct business, DeFi will need to comply with various governments’ regulatory requirements, agreed most participants in closed-door roundtable discussions at Consensus 2023.  This article is excerpted from CoinDesk’s inaugural Consensus @ Consensus Report, the product of intimate, curated group discussions that took place at Consensus 2023. Click here to download the full report.  DeFi today is a $47.8 billion industry, spread over a number of application-friendly blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Cardano and others. Its core group of users is composed of “crypto natives,” though a number of financial institutions have begun piloting closed-circuit versions of open DeFi protocols or running experiments on-chain.  While the sector is still relatively immature, DeFi could be said to be one of the few use cases in crypto that has found product-market fit. Moreover, in a year that saw several centralized crypto lending companies file for bankruptcy protection – many of which once had multi-billion-dollar valuations and counted tens of thousands of users – no major DeFi application failed during the months that saw crypto’s total market capitalization decrease from over $2 trillion to under $1 trillion.  These systems, which execute basic financial operations at any time of day using pre-set rules and publicly auditable code, were and remain able to return funds to users, liquidate underwater loans based on pre-established collateral requirements and generate yield.  See also: Crypto and Regulators Are Speaking the Same Language When It Comes to Transparency | Opinion  It is for this reason that many stakeholders across DeFi think the best course for the industry is not to implement know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures standard in traditional finance (aka TradFi), but to work with and educate regulators and institutions on accepting DeFi as it exists.  The task at hand is to demonstrate why those design decisions were made, and what benefits they may bear for users and financial watchmen. Because anyone can publish code to a blockchain and because anyone with sufficient technological knowledge can access that code, some amount of unregulated, unsurveilled and potentially illicit DeFi activity will always be possible.

Tether Sharks & Whales Grow Holdings As USDT Exchange Supply Plunges According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, these large Tether holders are now carrying a total of $16 billion worth of the stablecoin. The relevant indicator here is the “USDT Supply Distribution,” which tells us how the Tether supply is distributed among the various holder groups in the market currently. Investors or addresses are divided into these holder groups based on the total number of coins that they are holding right now. In the context of the current discussion, the key “shark” and “whale” cohorts are of interest, the combined coin range of which can be defined as $100,000-$10 million. Naturally, this holder group would include all addresses on the blockchain that are carrying at least $100,000 and at most $10 million worth of USDT in their balances. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Tether Supply Distribution specifically for the sharks and whales over the last six months: The value of the metric seems to have sharply gone up in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Tether addresses holding between $100,000-$10 million have seen their combined supply shoot up recently. Interestingly, this rise has coincided with Bitcoin observing some high volatility due to Binance being sued by the SEC over alleged fraud. Generally, investors use stablecoins like USDT whenever they want to exit volatile coins like BTC. Thus, investors exchanging their assets for stables can be a sign of selling. It’s possible that the latest rise in the supply of sharks and whales has come because of these humongous holders ditching cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in these uncertain times. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Dormant 1,433 BTC Moves After 10+ Years However, usually, whenever holders opt for stablecoins instead of exiting through fiat or other means, it means that they are possibly looking to eventually return back into the volatile markets. When such investors finally feel that the prices are right to step back into the other coins, they shift their USDT into their desired asset, thus providing buying pressure on its price. Because of this reason, the stablecoin supply may be looked at as the available buying power for assets like Bitcoin. As the sharks and whales have loaded up on Tether and have taken their supply to a new all-time high of $16 billion, the potential dry powder for BTC has also gone up. It’s unknown when these humongous holders may finally shift back into the cryptocurrency, but when they do, it’s probable that its price would feel a bullish boost. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Herald Higher Volatility, What’s Next For BTC? The data for the exchange supply (that is, the amount sitting in exchange wallets) of Tether is also shown as rising in the chart. It looks like this metric has gone up while the sharks and whales have been buying, implying that the coins exiting from these platforms are being picked up by these cohorts. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,600, down 2% in the last week.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Binance.US says it's temporarily transitioning to an all-crypto exchange as of June 13, citing pressures from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which targeted the company with a major enforcement action this week. In a tweet, the U.S. arm of Binance said USD and deposits will be suspended as of June 9, and USD-based trading pairs will be de-listed shortly after. Trading, staking and deposits and withdrawals in crypto will remain fully operational.  Cryptocurrency custody firm BitGo has reached a preliminary agreement to buy Prime Trust, another crypto custody specialist regulated in the state of Nevada. In a blog post, BitGo confirmed an earlier story from CoinDesk that a tentative deal had been agreed upon. In a statement, Prime Trust Interim CEO Jor Law called the move ""a significant enhancement for the industry."" BitGo President Mike Belshe described the deal as a “landmark transaction … With the expected acquisition of Prime Trust, BitGo is well positioned to enhance its best-in-class, trusted solutions and to service the combined customer base.”  Coinbase (COIN) shares are ""uninvestable"" in the near term, investment bank Berenberg said in a research report Thursday. The company was already expected to report weak second-quarter 2023 trading volumes before the SEC filed a lawsuit against it on Tuesday, said analyst Mark Palmer. This weakness may now persist and intensify thanks to the overhang from the SEC action, he added. ""The upshot is that we view COIN shares as uninvestable in the near term."" Palmer maintained his hold rating on the stock, but slashed his price target to $39 from $55, suggesting nearly 30% downside from last night’s close of $54.90.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows year-to-date gains in the two-year government bond yields across the advanced world.  Yields have bounced back sharply from lows reached in April/May, denting the appeal of risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Trending Posts  Can Binance Survive the SEC's Charges?

ERD is a lending platform that allows users to borrow USDE, a USD-pegged stablecoin native to the platform, using liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) and blue-chip DeFi tokens as collateral. The protocol maintains a minimum collateralization ratio of 110%, striking a balance between decentralization, capital efficiency, and price stability. In the fast-paced world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, the demand for fully decentralized stablecoins is growing. The challenge has been to simultaneously achieve capital efficiency, price stability, and decentralization, a combination that has proven difficult to achieve. Numerous attempts have been made to create stablecoins that are both decentralized and capital efficient. However, these efforts often led to significant price fluctuations, causing depegging and collapse. The industry has thus been left with a choice between capital efficiency and decentralization, with price stability being a crucial requirement for any stablecoin's survival and expansion. Ethereum Reserve Dollar is designed to address these challenges. ERD is fully decentralized, providing a safer solution to the dominant centralized and semi-centralized stablecoins in the market. It employs a fully decentralized lending protocol and a robust liquidation mechanism, enabling users to borrow USDE using LSDs and blue-chip DeFi tokens as collateral. The platform secures loans with a Stability Pool containing USDE, which allows for immediate liquidation and bypasses the need for liquidators to prepare USDE or engage in a complex auction process. Furthermore, the protocol's design allows users to borrow at only a 110% collateralization ratio, achieving an ideal combination of decentralization, capital efficiency, and price stability. Notably, ERD also aims to provide greater value as a governance token and introduce widely distributed decentralized assets on the ETH network, addressing limitations observed in similar protocols, such as those of the Liquity Protocol. “Looking back at the collapses of so many failed stablecoins, and the depegging of USDT in 2022 and USDC in 2023, the industry is still searching for a truly decentralized, capital-efficient, and robust solution,"" said Steve Hopkins, ERD’s CMO. “ERD is this and so much more; it's a solution designed to become a truly decentralized reserve asset on the Ethereum network. We believe ERD offers a significant step forward in blockchain and DeFi technology. We’re thrilled to share it with the world. ” The ERD team will launch their testnet event on June 12, 2023. This event will offer the opportunity to experience the platform's unique features and benefits firsthand, while also entitling early adopters to share in the upside of the project’s growth. The ERD Protocol is set to redefine the stablecoin landscape. With its unique features and benefits, it offers a promising solution for efficient and decentralized lending. The team encourages everyone to participate in the upcoming testnet event and experience the future of DeFi. For more information about the ERD Protocol and its upcoming testnet event, please visit the official website at https://erd.xyz/ and follow the project on Twitter at @Ethereum_ERD. About ERD ERD is a decentralized lending protocol that enables users to borrow in USDE, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, using LSDs and blue-chip DeFi tokens as collateral. It aims to address the dominance of centralized stablecoins and offer a truly decentralized, capital-efficient alternative. The protocol offers a minimum collateralization ratio of 110% and secures loans with a stable pool containing USDE and other Ethereum-based assets. The benefits of ERD include low-interest rates, high capital efficiency, direct redemptions, and decentralization. Its goal is to become a truly decentralized reserve asset on the Ethereum network.

DOGE's transaction volume has recently increased to new highs due to Ordinals inscriptions on Dogecoin. A similar thing is happening on Bitcoin. DOGE needs a Layer 2 solution to handle serious payments. Otherwise, it is going to fail as money. The bull case for DOGE relies on its easy-going and wholesome brand image, while the bear case points to its competition with Bitcoin and slowing development. I was recently asked to write a Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) article. My initial reaction was, in my opinion, a rather predictable and conformist response. I viewed Dogecoin largely as a joke with no chance of long-term price appreciation or widespread adoption. It is simply a digital asset created as a joke and pumped up by celebrities like Elon Musk via social media. This mainstream viewpoint looks at Dogecoin and all ""memecoins"" as something to ignore for serious investors. Though I still maintain this perspective in spirit and practice, as I do not own any DOGE nor plan to in the foreseeable future, I think there are certain merits to Dogecoin which detractors should be aware of. This article summarizes those findings. What is Dogecoin and DOGE tokenomics? The doge meme comes from a 2010 picture of a Shiba Inu dog. It is meant to be an adorable dog whose internal thoughts are written in broken English. The thoughts seem very scatterbrained and sometimes affectionately sarcastic. Doge was a very popular meme and was even named the Know Your Meme ""top meme"" in 2013. Dogecoin was created that same year. DOGE is the native cryptocurrency of the Dogecoin blockchain. This chain was a fork of Litecoin (LTC-USD), which itself was modeled after Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Litecoin is sometimes referred to as the ""silver to Bitcoin's gold."" This metaphor alludes to the history of bi-metallic monetary standards where gold was the solid, large-transaction medium of exchange while silver was used for more day-to-day purchases like buying a loaf of bread. Litecoin's ~2.5 minute block time is about 4x faster than Bitcoin's 10 minute block time, which theoretically makes it more user-friendly in everyday transactions. Dogecoin's block time is even faster: 1 minute. Dogecoin uses proof-of-work consensus, where miners have to solve mathematical puzzles to add the next block to the blockchain. By doing so, they help settle DOGE transactions and are compensated with fees (paid in DOGE by users) and block rewards (brand new DOGE created with each new block). This is how all proof-of-work chains function. Dogecoin's creation was admittedly a joke . However, this does not preclude the technology from working as intended. Dogecoin is a functioning, decentralized network which can facilitate value transfers. It is secured by a sizeable hash rate. One initially off-putting feature of DOGE was its uncapped supply. Upon closer examination, I found that Dogecoin simply has a fixed tail-emission. Each new block provides a 10,000 DOGE block reward and 1 block is added every minute. This means about 5.2 billion DOGE is added to the token supply annually. Because there are currently around 140 billion DOGE, this works out to an annual supply inflation rate of 3.7%. And, since the denominator (token supply) increases each year but the numerator (5.2 billion new DOGE) stays the same, the annual inflation rate will asymptotically approach 0. However, it will be higher than 3.5% for many, many years. Other coins such as Monero (XMR-USD) have a similar kind of tail emission with a decreasing inflation rate. There is a case to be made that tail emissions incentivize continuous block creation, and thus preserves security, even when network activity lulls. New Transaction Volume Highs Dogecoin's transaction volume has recently increased to new highs, prompting a few headlines to call attention to this development. Notably, Dogecoin managed to exceed the daily transactions of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD). Transaction Volumes BTC, ETH, DOGE (BitInfoCharts) First, it's good to put this headline into context. Because Dogecoin is forked from Litecoin, it is already designed to handle more transactions than Bitcoin. The fact that it hasn't done so until very recently just means that there hasn't been much interest in using DOGE as a medium of exchange. This brings us to the second point, which is the reason for the recent surge in transactions on Dogecoin. If you are watching the crypto space, you might have heard about Ordinal theory and adding inscriptions to individual satoshis on Bitcoin. The idea is that because there is a finite amount of satoshis, one could assign numbers to each one and inscribe data on them. This movement has prompted an increase in the Bitcoin transactions, mainly to mint NFTs on Bitcoin by inscribing images or video data to satoshis. The same process can be done on Dogecoin . The scramble to create these inscriptions on the biggest memecoin was basically what triggered the recent surge in Dogecoin transaction volume. A similar increase in transaction volume and fees has been happening on Bitcoin. As the hype around Ordinals inscriptions dies down, this spike should dissipate. For now, inscriptions on both Dogecoin and Bitcoin have been used on relatively meaningless things like images and JSON text. Although there is a decent case that inscriptions can be useful, it is highly doubtful that a useful implementation of inscriptions will materialize on Dogecoin. The main value of inscriptions is that data will be permanently etched into a blockchain. There is potentially tremendous value in this. However, Bitcoin has much more security and immutability than Dogecoin owing to its much higher hash rate. Economically serious usage of inscriptions are likely to dismiss non-Bitcoin chains. Lacking new developments, there is no reason for Dogecoin's transaction volume to stay elevated. Where Things Turn Bearish No blockchain can serve as payments infrastructure totally by itself. The current monetary system relies on layers, and a monetary system using digital asset payments must also scale via higher layers. This is why Bitcoin's Lightning Network and Ethereum's rollups are getting more attention nowadays. Dogecoin will not be ready to handle serious payments without a L2 solution. The current development roadmap pushed out by the Dogecoin Foundation focuses on platform integrations and wallets, rather than L2-based scaling. It also doesn't focus on scaling the base layer. What's more concerning is that the progress updates are put on Twitter by the Foundation's project lead , but not written into the Foundation's website. Dogecoin Trailmap Update (Twitter) Also, both the Foundation's blog and announcements page have been untouched since the year began. If there is less interest in developing on Dogecoin, the network will stagnate over time. The most bearish aspect is that DOGE is attempting to be currency. There indeed isn't an economic use case for the blockchain besides currency and inscriptions. The same can be said for Bitcoin and BTC. Trying to be currency means an object must engage in the competition for liquidity. There isn't a reason why DOGE could beat the biggest digital asset, BTC, at this competition. In the long term, people converge on a single money. Today, it is the U.S. Dollar. In the realm of digital assets, the king is undeniably BTC. The Bull Case for DOGE The meme and humorous context behind Dogecoin is likely the best path to DOGE maintaining its relevance. As long as people find the concept behind DOGE amusing and desire to use it for transactions, it will remain. Amusement is value, even if it is not in the textbook sense of generating a yield or being a financial store of value. Thus, the bull case is rather fickle, and based on what can be described as a niche sentiment at best. Despite this, DOGE is not a scam. It is not a pump-and-dump scheme even though people may have used it as such in the past. The blockchain is sufficiently active and functional. The underappreciated fact is that DOGE's brand is certainly more approachable than most crypto today. That gives it potential to stick around and grow. I have often thought that Bitcoin is a good product with awful public relations. The very outspoken Bitcoin bulls, labelled ""Bitcoin maxis,"" tend to appear cultish and off-putting, even to the crypto industry. Extremism and ignorant biases are nearly always bad for investing. Contrast that with Dogecoin's lighthearted, easy-going, and wholesome brand image and there is a non-zero chance that it could hold its own as a bright image of positivity in an otherwise cutthroat world. Wholesome Message of Dogecoin (Dogecoin Foundation) Do Only Good Everyday = DOGE (Dogecoin Foundation) DOGE is the biggest memecoin in the market and the fact that it has remained in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap is quite impressive. What's more is that it is actually the second largest payments coin that is not a stablecoin. Not bad for this friendly Japanese canine. Crypto Ranking By Market Cap (Investing.com) Conclusion I rate DOGE a hold. It doesn't make financial sense to invest in a money-candidate that has very little chance of winning a liquidity competition within its own category (digital assets). Development seems to be slowing and the roadmap is focused on things which are unhelpful or inadequate for providing utility as a payment system. But it doesn't make sense to short sell this either! The borrowing fees are high and it is not worth the risk of a FOMO-induced melt-up. Despite its apparent lack of utility, DOGE has proved quite resilient in holding its position as a big player in crypto. It isn't one of those highly inflationary smart contract tokens which mercilessly dilute investors. And it has clear potential to stick around based on its own merits, no matter how uneconomic this merit might seem.

However, recent developments have cast a dark cloud over the once-promising digital asset. With an astonishing 95% of ApeCoin holders finding themselves deep in the red, the future of this innovative cryptocurrency hangs in the balance. Negative sentiment surrounding ApeCoin has become a prominent concern for its community. Once buoyed by optimism and excitement, investors now face frustration as their holdings plummet in value. This loss of confidence not only undermines ApeCoin’s credibility but also raises questions about its long-term sustainability. Related Reading: Pepecoin 15% Drop Sparks Speculation: Will Further Pain Follow? Diminishing Network Growth, Trading Velocity Compound APE’s Challenges Founder of NotLarvaLabs, Pauly, has revealed a troubling statistic: an alarming 95% of ApeCoin holders are currently grappling with financial losses, painting a bleak picture for the once-promising cryptocurrency. Looks like @apecoin is already right around it’s all time low price. Over 95% of the holders are already at a loss. And the @yugalabs team, insiders and “launch contributors” are paying themselves 10s of millions of dollars a month in $ape. See here:https://t.co/toavf11b8v — PAULY (@Pauly0x) June 7, 2023 ApeCoin’s price decline can be primarily attributed to the diminishing growth of its network, which has witnessed a noticeable decrease in interest from new addresses over the past three months. This decline in interest reflects a diminishing enthusiasm for APE among potential investors. In addition to the decline in network growth, ApeCoin’s trading velocity, which measures the frequency of transactions, has also experienced a significant drop during this period. This decline in trading activity further exacerbates the challenges faced by ApeCoin, indicating a lack of liquidity and reduced participation in the market. Source: Coingecko As per the latest information from CoinGecko, ApeCoin is currently priced at $2.90, with a marginal 24-hour rally of 0.2%. However, the cryptocurrency has undergone a notable decline of 6.6% over the past seven days, underscoring the volatility and uncertainty surrounding its value. Whale Interest Persists Amidst ApeCoin’s Struggles Interestingly, despite the aforementioned challenges, there remains a glimmer of interest in ApeCoin from influential investors known as whales. These large addresses continue to demonstrate their engagement with APE, as evidenced by the increasing percentage of ApeCoin held by them. This suggests that some prominent investors still perceive potential in the cryptocurrency, although the impact of their involvement on ApeCoin’s overall trajectory remains uncertain. Bitcoin halfway from the $27K territory. BTCUSD chart: TradingView.com MVRV Ratio Declines As APE’s Price Drops The falling price of APE has had a direct impact on its MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio, indicating that a considerable number of APE holders lack significant incentives to sell their holdings at the current juncture. Related Reading: Polkadot Metrics Surge With Project Launches – Good News For DOT Price? This decline in the MVRV ratio raises concerns about the selling pressure on APE and suggests that many investors are reluctant to part ways with their APE tokens while the price remains low. Meanwhile, the sell-offs by short-term holders could create additional downward pressure on APE’s price and further exacerbate the challenges faced by the cryptocurrency.

Built on Bitcoin it enables users to own their content and be able to send microtransactions. Social media platforms are censored The social media platforms of today are highly successful, but at what cost? It turns out that Twitter was being used by government to suppress certain conversations that were against their narrative, and Youtube regularly de-platforms anyone who is perceived to not be following their rules. Other social media platforms are in a similar position. Bitcoin is successful because it cannot be taken down by any government or their agencies. It is for the people to be able to protect their wealth from a banking system that does not serve them. Fairly rewarded content Nostr was built on top of Bitcoin, and is the first open protocol that is truly censorship-resistant. ZEBEDEE and Nostr co-creator Fiatjaf have taken this further, and on Thursday launched the ZBD app, which will enable users to have their content fairly rewarded, in that they will be able to keep 99% of the value they created. The social media features of the new app includes a game-changing development called “Zaps”. These are tiny micropayments as small as $0.0002, which can be sent to anyone in the world instantly and without censorship. The messages, profiles, and posts are not limited to any one platform, and can flow across any Nostr-powered app or website, so if one platform is shut down there are many more that can receive the social media. Also featured on the new app is the ability to be able to send payments through DMs (Direct Messaging), and to earn payments through games, podcasts, music, art, and whatever a user can dream up that might create value. Empowerment of people André Neves, CTO and co-founder of ZEBEDEE said of the launch of the ZBD app: “ZEBEDEE is all about empowering people through open, decentralized technologies. The new social layer within the ZBD app delivers an all-in-one space for people to connect, play, and earn while embracing our core values. We're spicing up the ZBD ecosystem to offer an unprecedented user experience, blending social media, gaming, shopping, and Bitcoin,” From the ZEBEDEE PR announcement: “To secure early access to this upgrade of the ZBD app, available for iOS and Android, users can sign up at https://zeb.gg/early-access.

42393370,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTHSn,1686307799,"Free Promotional NFTs, Crypto Airdrops Would Be Banned Under New UK Rules, Official Says","Giving away free non-fungible tokens (NFT) or cryptocurrencies through airdrops to promote investing in digital assets would be prohibited after the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) new rules come into effect, an official at the regulator told CoinDesk.  The U.K.’s strict crypto financial promotions rules will come into effect on Oct. 8, according to a report the FCA published on Thursday. Under these rules, crypto will be categorized as a “restricted mass market investment,” and will require adverts on crypto to have clear risk warnings. What’s more, incentives for the general public to invest in cryptocurrencies will be banned.  Crypto companies and celebrities in the past have presented clients and fans with free NFTs that are tied to a project’s blockchain or represent real world assets. Projects have also given out crypto airdrops as part of broader marketing initiatives.  These free NFTs and airdrops, when used to promote investing in crypto products, could result in consumers buying crypto that they realize “can be problematic later,” said Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the FCA.  Crypto airdrops and NFTs themselves will not be banned – merely promotions involving airdrops, said Long, who was appointed last year to lead the FCA’s crypto work.  Read more: UK FCA Proposes Ban on Crypto Incentives in Tough New Marketing Rules  When the FCA consulted on its marketing rules last year, respondents largely disagreed with proposals like banning incentives, treating crypto as a mass market investment and blocking new investors from getting non-real-time promotion offers (DOFP), the FCA’s policy document from Thursday said.  Typically, only entities that are authorized by the FCA can approve their own ads. Since there is currently no regime in place that allows the FCA to fully authorize crypto firms, the government has made way for a limited time exemption that will allow crypto firms registered with the FCA to comply with its anti-money laundering requirements to approve their own ads starting in October.  Eventually, however, only FCA-authorized entities will be able to approve advertisements. Some in the industry fear the requirement may be too restrictive.  “The requirement that all approvers of financial promotions have an understanding of crypto assets and have permission to act as an approver also has the potential to introduce an overly restrictive regime, based on the incredibly small number of organizations which would meet that criteria for approver status,” Su Carpenter, director of operations at lobby group CryptoUK said in a statement.  The FCA plans on implementing the above measures regardless of industry pushback.  Long said that the FCA did listen to the respondents who contributed to its consultation last year and chose rules that it believed were the “safest possible set of rules.""  Several lawyers CoinDesk spoke to welcomed the regime as something that would ensure consumers are protected.  “The stability and oversight of the latest FCA changes will potentially enhance consumer and market confidence in the digital assets sphere,” Will Charlesworth, crypto assets partner at U.K.-based Keystone Law said in a statement.  Since January 2020, the FCA has received 318 crypto applications for registration, and 41 crypto firms have managed to complete the registration process. The regulator has faced some criticism for its registration regime with some companies complaining it’s too lengthy.  “They are high standards, and they are high standards for a reason, because we want custody to be safe and we don't want money laundering,” Long said, talking about the registration regime. He added that the FCA has dialogues with crypto companies on a weekly basis.  Read more: UK Crypto Firms and Regulator Blame Each Other for Industry Exodus  The U.K. recently closed a consultation on new rules for the crypto sector and proposed a new authorization regime for all crypto firms – including those already registered with the FCA – that would be run by the regulator.  Long said the FCA’s focus is on six key areas, which includes dealing with fraud and cross border risk as set out in a recently published report by international securities regulator IOSCO addressing investor protection and market integrity concerns.

42393389,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTIcb,1686307125,"EU Governments Friendly to Tough Crypto Bank-Capital Restrictions, Negotiator Says","European Union governments appear to support new bank-capital standards, which could see unbacked crypto treated as the riskiest kind of asset for lenders to hold, according to an official leading talks on new legislation.  The move could mean assets such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are given the maximum possible risk weight as part of a lengthy set of banking laws, which could be agreed as soon as next week.  It’s already known that the European Parliament favors what one lawmaker has called “prohibitive” measures to isolate crypto from the banking system, and now the EU’s Council – an arm of the legislature representing member states that would also need to agree the plans – appears amenable too.  “We find the commission paper a good basis to move forward,” said Mats Anderson, a Swedish diplomat, at an event in Spain to discuss the new rules. Anderson is the counsellor for financial services and markets at the EU representation of Sweden, which is currently chairing talks as the Council’s Presidency, and said his remarks were based on discussions with the bloc’s other 26 members.  Anderson then added that his reference to a European Commission paper had been a “Freudian slip,” after being gently rebuked for appearing to confirm the existence of a document that has never been officially published.  In January, the European Parliament proposed to give crypto assets like bitcoin the maximum possible 1,250 percent risk weight, meaning lenders would have to hold a euro of capital for each euro of crypto issued – a conservative approach, which some traditional-finance lobbyists have warned could impede deal-making.  In a secret document seen by CoinDesk, the commission then proposed to ease that somewhat by allowing lower risk weights for stablecoins regulated under a separate law known as MiCA, which takes effect in 2024. That’s seen as a transitional measure until standards from the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are finalized.  The banking package has proved thorny, and includes controversial non-crypto topics such as how to assess the risk of corporate loans and how to treat foreign lenders entering the bloc. But after more than 18 months of talks, officials now appear to feel a deal is imminent.  Progress with talks ""makes me hopeful that we can strike an agreement at least by the end of June,” said commission official Martin Merlin, a director at the EU executive’s financial-services arm, while Anderson appeared to suggest a political deal may even be possible at a meeting scheduled for June 15.

This price level is still bullish for the digital asset which is now only around 60% down from its all-time high. However, there is a threat to the stability that the digital asset has enjoyed so far which could send its price spiraling back down toward the $1,000 level. What Could Send Ethereum Back To $1,000? This week, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought lawsuits against top exchanges Binance and Coinbase, with more regulatory action expected to come toward crypto firms as time goes on. But one of the most important parts of the lawsuit was the SEC naming some cryptocurrencies as securities. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Declines As Market Recovers Amid Security Charges The list which the regulator hinted was not exhaustive included the likes of Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), among others. Interestingly, the SEC did not name Ethereum as a security despite the digital asset’s status being a hot topic of debate over the last year. What’s important about the cryptocurrencies that the regulator named is the fact that they are proof of stake (POS) networks, a mechanism which Ethereum transitioned to back in 2022. This has sparked speculation that while ETH was not listed as a security, it could very well be on the regulator’s radar to do so in the future. If Ethereum does get listed as a security, the cryptocurrency could become a target for the SEC, which is already in a drawn-out battle with Ripple for the same allegations. When Ripple was sued back in 2020, the asset suffered a massive crash of up to 60% of its value. A repeat of such an event for Ethereum could easily see the digital asset fall to $1,000, and even lower. ETH price resting above $1,800 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com However, the SEC has not made any indications of going after Ethereum. Right now, it seems to have its hands full with Ripple, Binance, and Coinbase, all of which have been vocal about fighting the regulator in court as they object to the charges brought against them. ETH Price Still Holding Firmly Even amid speculations that Ethereum would end up being classified as a security, the token is still maintaining a bullish outlook in the mid to long-term. It is trading above its 100-day moving average of $1,758, which shows investors’ willingness to purchase the asset at prices higher than they did three months ago. Related Reading: Not Immune To FUD?

Despite an impressive rally of over 50,000% between April 15 and May 5, PEPE has seen its value plummet by more than 60%, with a significant 15% drop occurring in the past week alone. The sudden decline in Pepecoin’s value has triggered a wave of uncertainty among market participants. Many are now questioning whether this dip is just a temporary setback or a sign of deeper underlying issues. Related Reading: FUD Storm: Top 5 Market Losers In Heightened Uncertainty Pepecoin Price Movement Creates Bearish Sentiment Pepecoin (PEPE) witnessed a breakout in its price yesterday, but the momentum was short-lived as it quickly plummeted by over 30%, establishing a new low.

As the price approaches the apex of this formation, a crucial point where the triangle converges, PEPE could be poised for a significant movement in the coming days. Total market cap of cryptocurrencies currently at $1.07 trillion on the daily chart at TradingView.com PEPE is currently trading at a price of $0.00000112 via CoinGecko, showing a modest 24-hour rally of 2.7%. However, over the past seven days, the coin has experienced a decline of 12.3%. Source: Coingecko Investors and traders closely monitoring PEPE are advised to exercise caution as the price nears a critical juncture. The impending move from the apex of the descending triangle formation could potentially determine the direction in which the coin will head next. Mixed Signals In Trading Volume Pepecoin presents a mixed picture when considering its trading volume and market capitalization. While the price decline raises concerns, other metrics suggest a more optimistic scenario for the meme-based cryptocurrency. According to CoinMarketCap, PEPE has experienced an increase in trading volume, rising by 27% over the past 24 hours to reach $241 million. This surge in trading activity indicates that there is still considerable interest and engagement from market participants, potentially hinting at underlying support for the coin.

In addition, PEPE’s market capitalization has shown a slightly bullish trend, with a notable jump of 20.23% to reach $492 million. However, it is important to note that trading volume and market capitalization do not necessarily guarantee a sustained recovery or an upward price movement for PEPE. These metrics can be influenced by various factors, including short-term trading activity and speculative interest. Therefore, while they provide some positive indications, they should be interpreted cautiously in the context of PEPE’s bearish bias.

IOG said SEC lawsuits filed earlier this week against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase, which included ADA in a list of crypto tokens that count as securities, contained “numerous factual inaccuracies.” The allegations will have no impact on IOG's operations, the company said in a Friday statement.  “Under no circumstances is ADA a security under U.S. securities laws. It never has been,” IOG said. “Understanding how decentralized blockchains operate is a fundamental component in creating responsible legislation.”  Read More: Robinhood Ends Support for All Tokens Named in SEC Lawsuit as Securities  IOG said regulation through enforcement actions does not provide the necessary clarity or certainty that both the blockchain industry and consumers deserve.  The ADA price fell 3% in the past 24 hours as tokens named in the SEC lawsuit extended their sell-off as traders reacted to regulatory risk.  The SEC also identified tokens issued by foundations and companies or tied to protocols Polygon (MATIC), Sandbox (SAND), Filecoin (FIL), Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Flow (FLOW), Internet Computer (ICP), Near (NEAR), Voyager (VGX), Dash (DASH) and Nexo (NEXO) as securities.

13646805,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537147,1686300355,Next Crypto To Explode? Mechanism Capital Co-Founder Reveals Altcoin Gem,"Andrew Kang, a renowned crypto entrepreneur and investor, has revealed via Twitter his choice for the next cryptocurrency that may soon explode in price. Kang is the co-founder of Mechanism Capital, which invests in cryptocurrencies through prop trading, mining, ventures, and secondary markets. In the crypto community, Kang has made a name for himself with his winning trades. On Twitter, Kang now shared his latest crypto find: Radiant Capital (RDNT). The altcoin has a market cap of just $77.3 million, currently ranking #287 among all cryptocurrencies. According to Kang, Radiant Capital has the potential to become the “new king of the money markets,” toppling market leaders Aave and Compound from their thrones with a TVL of $5 trillion and $2 trillion, respectively. According to the investor, Radiant Capital can succeed because it is innovating while the others are treading water. Next Crypto To Explode A La SUSHI? However, with a current TVL of $260 million via Arbitrum and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Radiant has a long way to go. The case for Radiant is strong, however, according to Kang: the platform is the first functional cross-chain market maker (borrowing on the X-chain, lending on the Y-chain). Related Reading: UK Financial Conduct Authority Clamps Down on Crypto Marketing Also boosting RDNT’s price could be its upcoming launch on Ethereum and zkSync. Another advantage Radiant Capital has over its competitors, according to Kang, is the potential yield. While Aave & Compound only yield 1-2% on stablecoins, less than treasuries, Radiant can offer much more lucrative rates. “With >$100B stablecoin mkt cap & $10B+ stables once in MMs now idle, this untapped liquidity is a huge opportunity: as 10-40% stablecoin yields from an audited, year-old protocol become known, expect TVL growth,” speculates Kang. The second biggest opportunity according to him are Ethereum and Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) when the mainnet dApp launches. Once that happens, Kang expects Radiant to capture a piece of Compound & Aave’s $4 trillion pie through sustained, incentivized yield. Another argument: with the rise of Layer Zero and zksync, Radiant could be well on its way to becoming a major beneficiary as people use the platform to farm potential airdrops. Related Reading: Coinbase CEO Takes On SEC, Igniting Crypto Community’s Passion for Clarity Also worth noting, according to Kang, is that Radiant has already surpassed Aave, Compound, and even Solana in 90 day revenue. Looking at the 90 day trend, Radiant is the fastest growing protocol in this field. However, the biggest trigger for an explosive rise in the price of the RDNT token could be a vampire attack on the outdated liquidity of existing money markets, a la Sushiswap. Kang writes in his latest tweet today: Sushiswap’s vampire attack on Uniswap was a core factor in it achieving a billion+ TVL and multi billion valuation. Have we seen a successful one since then? What about a vampire attack on money markets? If billions of stables and LSDs are barely earning 1-2% in Aave and Compound, how much would move for 10% yield? 20%? 30%? Kang Buys $1.11 Million In RDNT As Arkham Intel reports, Kang has followed up his words (after the first tweet on Wednesday) with action. Andrew Kang’s on-chain address has begun acquiring RDNT tokens. Initially, the trader bought 3.922 million RDNT for $1.11M. With Andrew Kang @Rewkang‘s thread about Radiant Capital yesterday, his on-chain address has begun acquiring $RDNT tokens. Over the past 24 hours, his address 0xe8c has bought 3.922M $RDNT for $1.11M. This has since increased in value to $1.19M – a gain of ~$80K in under 24h! https://t.co/sZyFJUWchV pic.twitter.com/2HFfLcjsLL — Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) June 8, 2023 However, Kang’s recommendation has not been met with unanimous enthusiasm throughout the crypto community. Some voices think that Kang’s theses are too far-fetched and not strong enough. On the other hand, it should be noted that the “Binance effect” of a listing already happened at the end of March this year. At press time, Radiant Capital (RDNT) traded at $0.2926.

Commonwealth Bank in Australia on Thursday introduced new measures to protect customers from possible scam risks associated with making payments to “certain” crypto exchanges. The bank announced it would decline or hold certain payments to crypto exchanges for 24 hours. It further said in the coming months, it would introduce AU$10,000 ($6,700) limits in a calendar month, giving the bank time to identify the customer payments to exchanges for crypto purchases. The bank added that it would closely monitor its new measure’s efficacy, saying they are subject to ongoing review. James Roberts, Commonwealth Bank General Manager of Group Fraud Management Services, said: Consumer interest in cryptocurrencies has been increasing, and unfortunately scammers globally are capitalising on this trend and masquerading as legitimate investment opportunities or diverting funds into cryptocurrency exchanges. Adding: The introduction of 24-hour holds, declines and limits on outbound payments to cryptocurrency exchanges will help reduce both the number of scams and the amount of money lost by customers. Measures Will Note Eliminate Scam Risk While the measures will not do away with scam risks, they are designed to reduce customers’ risk of falling victim to a scam. Mr Robert further stated: Customers who make payments to cryptocurrency exchanges are currently facing a significantly higher risk of potentially being scammed. While these measures will not eliminate the risk of customers suffering losses as a result of a scam that involves a payment to a cryptocurrency exchange, they are part of a range of initiatives designed to help customers reduce their risk of falling victim to a scam.

The full law, published alongside related legislation requires crypto wallet providers to identify their customers when they transfer funds, offers crypto companies, such as exchanges and wallet providers, a license to operate across the bloc, and introduces new governance and financial requirements for stablecoin issuers.  This comes as crypto operators in the U.S. face significant uncertainty, with the Securities and Exchange Commission suing Binance and Coinbase (COIN) on the basis that the tokens traded on their platforms constitute regulated financial instruments.  Publication of the 200-odd pages of law signals formal passage of a bill onto the EU’s statute book. In legal terms the two laws enter into force in 20 days’ time, and its provisions apply on December 30, 2024, with certain provisions taking effect slightly earlier on June 30, 2024.

42393405,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTR8t,1686283696,New Stablecoin Bill Drafted by House Republicans as Compromise With Democrats,"The Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee has released a new draft of the leading U.S. legislative proposal for overseeing stablecoins, and it includes some of the positions of Democratic lawmakers.  The bill posted Thursday is still just a draft, meant to be further discussed at a June 13 committee hearing, but it marks another potential move toward a bipartisan negotiation on the legislation that many believe could be the easiest way to take a first step toward U.S. regulation of crypto.  This considerably shorter new draft is meant to start melding some of the two parties’ positions, according to a committee spokesperson, and also adds further points from Republican committee members. This version would call for the Fed to write requirements for issuing stablecoins but would still let state regulators oversee the companies issuing the tokens.  It gives the Fed a few additional authorities of the Republican’s previous bill, including a power in emergency situations to intervene against state-regulated issuers. States could also pass their supervision duties over to the federal watchdog.  The panel’s chairman, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), has considered stablecoin legislation a priority since last year, before he took over the committee. When he won the gavel, he continued the work, though Democrats had complained that Republicans were re-writing the bill without their input. They later released their own version. The narrow scope of the bill and its past bipartisan support had been the strengths of the effort to date, but it’s not yet clear what Democrats think of the latest version.  The bill, were it introduced and passed by both chambers of Congress, would establish the first U.S. regulations for stablecoins – tokens tied to steady assets such as the dollar that are widely used in crypto markets for trading in and out of more volatile coins.  The new draft also cuts an earlier section calling for research on the merits of a digital dollar, an increasingly controversial idea criticized by Republicans, despite the Federal Reserve insisting it hasn’t taken a position on whether such a central bank digital currency (CBDC) is warranted for the U.S.  Read More: House Republicans Make Case on Stablecoin Bill After Democrats Called for Do-Over",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/09/new-stablecoin-bill-drafted-by-house-republicans-as-compromise-with-democrats,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a93039724e959268fabe74a75f9b9defe54cfd9-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

USD deposits will be suspended as of June 9, and USD-based trading pairs will be de-listed shortly after, the exchange said.  “While we remain open to a productive compromise that enables a thriving digital asset marketplace in America, Binance.US will continue to vigorously defend ourselves, our customers and the industry against the meritless attacks of the SEC,” the exchange tweeted.  Binance's BNB coin remains stable at $260.24. The token, which was accused of being a security by the SEC, is down 15% over the last week.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $26,474, roughly flat over the past 24 hours and about where it’s stood since Tuesday when the SEC filed its suit against Coinbase and asked a court to grant a temporary restraining order to freeze assets tied to Binance.US. The agency sued Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, on Monday, raising concerns that the latest regulatory crackdown would send markets plunging. BTC took an initial dive below $26,000 on Tuesday but has since held steady above the threshold with analysts suggesting that investors had already priced in the actions.  “It’s hard to imagine a tougher regulatory situation facing the digital asset industry in the United States than what’s happening right now,” Andrew Lawrence, co-founder and CEO of onchain custody platform Censo, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “ It can feel pretty bleak, and yet there’s been a tremendous resilience shown by Bitcoin and other key crypto assets. We saw a pullback that was far less pronounced than what happened during last year’s daisy chain of collapses.”  Read More: Can Binance Survive the SEC's Charges?  Lawrence attributed cryptos’ resilience at least partly to the growing embrace of digital assets outside the U.S. He highlighted the growing trade volumes in Asia as Hong Kong has facilitated retail trading and wider access to the industry, and new more crypto-friendly regulatory frameworks in the European Union and Dubai.  “Digital assets are truly global,” Lawrence noted, adding that “longer term, this industry is poised to continue its exponential growth. I just worry that the bulk of this growth will occur outside of the United States – that is, if there are no developments in terms of the positive proposed legislation that is currently working its way through Congress.”  Ether was recently changing hands at $1,852, about where it perched on Wednesday, same time. The second largest crypto in market value held tight in “uptrend” territory of the CoinDesk Indices Ether Trend Indicator (ETI), a bullish sign even as bitcoin has languished in a “downtrend” position.Tokens mentioned in the separate lawsuits rebounded slightly with BNB, the token of the Binance exchange, recently up 0.5% and ADA, SOL and MATIC, the tokens of the Cardano, Solana and Polygon smart contracts protocols, either flat or up slightly. Popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB were also in the green.  Major stock indexes closed on the upside with the S&P 500 rising 0.6% to end its longest bear market in 85 years amid a surge in technology stocks. Bear markets end when an index rises from a previous market low. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composition was up a percentage point. Treasury yields, which tend to travel inversely from crypto markets, sank. Jobless claims arrived higher than expected on Monday to buoy hopes that the U.S. central bank would suspend its year-long diet of interest rate hikes at its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting next week. Investors will be eyeing the next Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the latest indication that inflation is waning.  Meanwhile, in an email to CoinDesk, Sacha Ghebali, director of strategy at crypto information provider The Tie, wrote of “clear dislocations in the (crypto) market, resulting in rapid outflows of capital” from Binance. On Wednesday, the BTC-U.S. dollar trading pair on Binance.US jumped as high as $28,800 – likely the result of “large investors and active traders stopping their trading activity and pulling assets off the exchange as a result of risk-mitigation actions,” Ghebali wrote.  But he noted bitcoin’s price strength and the outperformance of DeFi tokens relative to centralized exchange ones. “This could be a result of users preferring decentralized exchanges over their centralized counterparts in light of the regulatory risks facing the latter,” he wrote.  He added: “The Ethereum ecosystem has also held up relatively well when compared to other ecosystems. The DeFi market capitalization, in general, is down roughly five percent since the beginning of the month, whereas the DeFi market capitalization on the Ethereum ecosystem specifically is down less than two percent.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polygon MATIC +2.1% Smart Contract Platform Terra LUNA +1.2% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK +1.1% Computing  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Avalanche AVAX −1.0% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM −0.6% Smart Contract Platform Polkadot DOT −0.5% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  A Halt to Rate Hikes but Not for Long  Will the U.S. central bank boost interest rates again next week? What will a decision to the affirmative or negative mean for crypto?  Steven McClurg, the chief investment officer for alternative asset management company Valkyrie believes the Federal Reserve will suspend its nearly year-long diet of rate hikes, given what he sees as an ongoing banking crisis. That may weigh favorably for digital assets, but in an interview on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, McClurg agreed with other analysts who believe the cessation will be temporary amid continued price pressure and other macroeconomic uncertainties.  Over the past year, Interest rate increases have tended to unsettle investors and send crypto prices downward.  ""It's very prudent that the Fed has decided to stop raising rates at the moment, primarily because we do have a banking crisis on our hands right now, and we also have a dollar competence crisis,"" McClurg said.  According to the CME Fedwatch tool, the probability that interest rates will remain at the current target rate of 5%-5.25% is 72.5%. That's ticked down over the past month when a flurry of data suggested that inflation would continue waning, but more mixed signals in recent weeks seem to have discouraged interest rate traders who participate in the ongoing survey.  Still, threats to the banking system have loomed large since a series of U.S. bank failures, that central bank critics have tied to its overzealousness. McClurg noted that banking deposits totaling hundreds of billions of dollars ""left the U.S. this year,"" and that Switzerland, which suffered its own banking crisis in March, resulting in the sale of Credit Suisse to rival UBS, had also seen a significant outflow ""to places like Singapore, Dubai, other jurisdictions where they feel like your money is a little safer.""  ""With continued interest rate hikes, the Fed would put many other banks in danger. So that's why we're on pause.""  McClurg called any continued decline in CPI a ""reversion to the mean scenario with inflation,"" where 4% plus is still very high. We're not seeing the 12% to 18% clips, but we're going to see that again.""  He added that he would be closely watching oil prices, which have retreated over the past year from near record highs. ""I believe oil will probably double in price this year, which will drive the rest of inflation,"" McClurg said. ""That will force the Fed to continue to raise rates to try to stave off inflation to the last half of the year.

Armstrong sold nearly 30,000 shares of his company worth over $1.7 million just two days before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated enforcement action against Coinbase. Related Reading: Stablecoin Market Cap Decreases, But Whales Remain Unfazed: Santiment Coinbase Investors Question CEO’s Stock Sale Prior SEC Complaint Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has come under scrutiny after selling a massive 29,730 shares of his company’s Class A Common Stock on June 5, 2023, according to a Form 4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Armstrong made the sale in eight separate transactions, all on the same date, at an average price of $60.3 per share. This netted him over $1.7 million in total. There is speculation that Armstrong’s stock sale was a pre-planned transaction, made before Coinbase’s stock plummeted from $63 per share to $44, a considerable decline of 30%. This has raised concerns among investors about the possibility of insider trading or a planned stock sale by the company’s executives. However, executives at publicly traded companies like Coinbase since 2021, are often required to follow strict rules about when and how they can trade their company’s stocks. They are typically required to set up a trading plan, which allows them to schedule sales of their stocks well in advance, at times when they do not possess insider information. The plan’s details, including how many shares to sell and when must be pre-determined and followed exactly. If Armstrong’s sale was made according to his plan, the timing of the sale just a day before the SEC lawsuit was made public would be a coincidence. However, some investors are still concerned about the optics of the sale and the possibility of insider trading. Nevertheless, companies are typically bound by disclosure rules that require them to inform the public of significant events as soon as possible. The announcement of the SEC lawsuit likely followed these rules, and it’s possible that the news coincided with Armstrong’s pre-scheduled stock sale. Ripple’s SEC Case Could Have Far-Reaching Implications For The Exchanges The ongoing SEC v. Ripple case has significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry, particularly for companies like Coinbase and Binance. According to crypto-friendly lawyer James Murphy, a ruling in favor of Ripple by Judge Torres could undermine the SEC’s case against Coinbase and Binance. Murphy believes that if Judge Torres rules that XRP tokens traded on secondary markets are not securities, it would weaken the SEC’s argument that Coinbase is operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker-dealer, and clearing broker. The SEC claims that 13 tokens traded on Coinbase are securities, but if those tokens are ruled not to be securities, the SEC’s case would fall apart. While a ruling by Judge Torres would not be binding precedent in other cases, Judge Rearden, who is presiding over the Coinbase case, is a new judge and works in the same court in lower Manhattan with Judge Torres. Murphy believes that Judge Rearden will pay close attention to Judge Torres’ legal reasoning in ruling whether $XRP is a security, and could follow that reasoning when analyzing whether the 13 tokens cited in the Coinbase complaint are securities.
