42428411,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7hJh,1515269707,Could XRP's Frenzied Rise Herald Future Growth?,"Chris Brookins is the founder of Valiendero Digital Assets, a blockchain and fintech focused VC firm.  The author invests in cryptocurrencies and has a position in XRP.      It's no secret the crypto space is in a speculative ""frothy"" frenzy currently.  Under these circumstances, fundamental analysis becomes less important. Speculators are trading on emotion and greed, not fundamentals. Such is arguably the case with XRP, the native token that powers Ripple's RippleNet ledger.  Over the last month, it has blown up by almost 1,400 percent, and it's showing no signs of slowing.  Amidst this short-term frenzy, however, there is also opportunity for long-term analysis.  When we made a trading recommendation on XRP to our investor network last month, we stated that despite XRP’s long-term hurdles, its price action and technical analysis charts were setting up nicely for a price spike.  At that time, XRP was trading between $0.25 — $0.30.  We did not forecast a specific price target given we don’t own a crystal ball, but we did see an interesting dichotomy forming. We thought Ripple had great company fundamentals and that XRP’s speculative investment potential was ripe for high risk and high reward.  Short-term analysis  Looking ahead, Pugilist Ventures maintains both its speculative fundamental evaluation and its positive short-term trading view for XRP; simultaneously.  While Ripple may be overbought, that doesn't mean the market won't keep buying. In short, if XRP maintains its exponential growth during 2018, then its long-term fundamentals may change for the positive according to the Theory of Reflexivity a la George Soros.  The fundamentals in the case of XRP are basically its long-term probability of becoming a quasi-reserve currency (QRC) for financial institutions. (We say ""quasi"" because we do not believe central banks will ever fully relinquish their local currencies without a fight.)  The path to QRC status will need to include demonstrable growth within the following areas:  Liquidity and market makers  Institutional derivatives that would allow banks to hedge foreign exchange exposure on their balance sheet  On-boarding financial institutions onto its xCurrent and xRapid products in both exotic and non-exotic corridors.  Reflexivity for XRP  By simple definition, Reflexivity is a three-part process whereby an asset’s price increase drives investor expectations higher which positively changes the asset’s fundamentals, resulting in further price appreciation.  Rinse and repeat.  Reflexive price appreciation may substantially increase demand and mainstream adoption for XRP. For example, imagine if XRP supersedes bitcoin’s (BTC) market cap in 2018.  This speculative demand spike would dramatically increase liquidity and potential derivatives coverage, which would help Ripple onboard more banks (fewer objections to adoption) onto xCurrent + xRapid, thus improving XRP’s fundamentals, i.e. the path to QRC status.  XRP is being driven primarily by speculation in our opinion.  However, this speculation may actually increase the long-term probability of success for XRP by increasing market liquidity, derivatives coverage and mainstream adoption as medium of exchange and store of value; while planting the seeds of a future QRC debate.  All of which provide fuel to Ripple’s most important business goal of growing financial institutions using both xCurrent and xRapid for global payments. Only time shall tell if this path bears fruit for Ripple and XRP.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

42428404,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7h7h,1515234055,What Crypto Didn't Give Us in 2017,"Ian Simpson is head of marketing and communications at Lakeside Partners, an early-stage investment firm in Zug, Switzerland.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Without a shadow of a doubt, this past year has been huge for cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology. Whatever the future may hold for Satoshi's brainchild and all that it has given birth to, 2017 will forever hold a singular position on the timeline of events in the crypto world.  But as a new year approaches, the urge to get caught up in all that has happened over the past 12 months could prevent us from considering what 2017 did not bring – and why.  Admittedly, it is hard not to be mesmerized by the numbers: the more than 1,300 cryptocurrencies, the $700-plus billion market cap they have produced or the eye-popping ICO raises of Tezos, Filecoin, Bancor and others – oh yes, and the gut-wrenching ride of bitcoin’s price as it climbed over $20 000 – and fell back down.  And yet, it is worthwhile taking a step back and considering what is still missing and what exactly this might mean for the year that is almost upon us.  1. We did not see mass adoption of blockchain for enterprise  While there has been plenty of talk about blockchain patents (Mastercard is one example) from big-name companies along with a surge in sign-ups to the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, 2017 did not bring a whole-hearted embracing of crypto by established players across various industry verticals.  Some will point to concrete financial and technology implementation factors to explain this – ""How can you invest in something that's still so immature?"" and ""If it can’t scale how can we depend on it?"" – and certainly those may be valid points.  Education (its lack and its acquisition) also plays a role. On the one hand, many executives still do not grasp how it actually works and yet still want to dabble in the space, if only to use the hype for marketing purposes.  On the flip side, the more informed decision-makers in large corporations become, the more they realize how much the blockchain world challenges the very core of current systems and paradigms. For many, this knowledge makes them pull back and refuse to ""take the leap.""  I also suspect that – perhaps subconsciously – the hype surrounding ICO funding also served as a reactionary force, ironically as the very buzz that put bitcoin and blockchain on the lips of thousands also made many fear its disruptive force.  If the wave of token sales slows in 2018 and regulatory uncertainty clears up, this may change, and arguably it must change if cryptocurrencies and token economics are going to stick around for the long haul.  It may also depend on the outcome of the next point…  2. We did not see a clear distinction between blockchain, tokens and cryptocurrencies  No one in particular is to blame for this, but the fact remains: 99.9 percent of people outside the technical crypto/blockchain community associate blockchain with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Period. Unfortunately, this is enough to block adoption by many.  If anything, the huge ICO numbers that 2017 produced only reinforced this association as headlines around the world flashed dollar amounts with each new token sale.  The problem with this is that, to the wider world, it inherently reduces crypto to ""a new way to make money through fundraising and speculation."" This is, and will continue to be, a major handicap going forward.  I personally applaud voices such as that of William Mougayar and guests of his Token Summit series, who add more perspective to the discussion and differentiate the various levels of technology and token models.  For blockchain to reach its true potential, these distinctions will need to be made and explained.  3. We have not yet seen self-regulation take hold  With major attention focused on the SEC, FCA and Swiss FINMA, regulation has never been far from the crypto conversation over the last year.  And in the face of expected scrutiny, numerous self-regulation initiatives have been formed with the Crypto Valley Association announcing a Code of Conduct and Waves setting up a foundation for ICO standards, among others.  So far, however, these initiatives haven't produced much, with the afore-mentioned Code of Conduct still unpublished.  In some ways, this can't be surprising since it isn't hard to imagine ""self-regulation"" as a clever tool to, on the one hand, keep governmental watchdogs at bay, while promoting a ""higher standard"" which can be used for financial gain.  The coming year may, indeed, bring more visible results on this front – and it should – before scam projects over-multiply and influential advisors over-abuse their positions to artificially pump projects of little-to-no value, compelling governmental regulators to take over in full force.  4. We do not have inter-chain operability.  Finally, in a more technical note, inter-chain operability remains (for now) an elusive holy grail.  The past year saw serious efforts to tackle it. Polkadot grabbed most of the attention (and its creator as well, for different reasons) and Cosmos not far behind. They're not the only ones, though, with quieter projects like Block Collider working with unique angles on the same problem.  Maybe it seems unreasonable to expect inter-chain connections to come along so soon, even as blockchain and crypto continue to in their relative infancy. But if there is one thing that 2017 didn’t give us, one gaping hole that 2018 can fill, this is it.  But what about the big successes? CoinDesk is still accepting submissions for its 2017 in Review.

42428396,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7gth,1515231947,What Meltdown and Spectre Flaws Mean for Crypto,"Recently leaked computer vulnerabilities Meltdown and Spectre offer yet another reminder of how hard the digital age makes it to keep private information – even cryptocurrency private keys – safe.  Unveiled Wednesday, the widespread hardware vulnerabilities simultaneously impact Intel, ARM and AMD computer chips, which power the vast majority of the world's computers, mobile devices and servers, making it possible to steal private data such as passwords, financial information or just about anything stored on any device that uses one of these chips.  Where this is important for cryptocurrency in particular is, hackers can potentially use the specific attack vector to pinch the private keys that allow users to control their bitcoins on the blockchain.  Popular Mechanics called it a ""horrific"" bug, contending it's ""hard to zero in on the most troubling part of this flaw,"" while an informational page authored by security researchers remarks that you're ""most certainly"" impacted by the bug.  And though there's no evidence that any passwords have been compromised, experts say it wouldn't be surprising if hackers or the NSA have been exploiting the attack.  If you're already following best practices for cryptocurrency storage, then you're probably fine. But if not, or if you're a newer user, experts say it's important to keep private keys on a safe device.  ""Better safe than sorry,"" said Bitcoin Core developer Bryan Bishop told CoinDesk, adding:  ""An attacker who has knowledge of a sufficiently powerful vulnerability can theoretically force your CPU to reveal secret data such as private keys used to control your bitcoin.""  Attack vectors  It's important to note that the advice to store private keys on a secure device is nothing new. (Crypto developers have long warned against storing private keys on laptops or other devices that interact with the internet.)  But the reasons why might not be obvious for newer users. Even though bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are secure protocols, they must interact with the open internet and regular computers. In short, storing private keys so close to the internet can potentially expose users to hacks and theft.  And the new CPU vulnerabilities make the situation even worse, as a chain of actions can lead to error and compromise.  ""If the protected memory problem is real, then a browser plugin or even a website may access your private keys,"" said Bitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli.  The full details of the issue aren't yet public, so it's unclear what the precise attack vectors are. Still, others suggested a similar impact could be likely.  ""To get hit by this attack, all you would have to do is click a link by accident and maybe you end up on a website that serves a bad ad with the malware code that steals your data,"" Bishop added.  And while these scenarios might sound far-fetched, most of today's malware prey on similar vulnerabilities that have yet to be patched. It's just impossible to know who and when they'll actually hit.  Operating system fixes are now available that users should use to patch up their Windows, Mac, and Linux devices. But, for cryptocurrency users, the better option is not to store private keys on an internet-connected device at all, a recommendation common far before this particular vulnerability.  One option is to store private keys on a so-called ""hardware wallet,"" such as Ledger or Trezor. The small devices might not be quite as easy to use, but they are more secure in that their not connected to the internet.  Pavol Rusnak, CTO of SatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor, went as far as to argue ""Using a [hardware] wallet is now more important than ever!"" While ethereum developer Lefteris Karapetsas quipped, ""I bet Spectre and Meltdown is the best thing that could have happened for cryptocurrency cold wallet businesses.""  Exchange treasure troves  Beyond solo consumer devices, a much bigger, more worrying target is cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses, which store cryptocurrency private keys for millions of users at once.  Some cryptocurrency exchanges use cloud hosting services such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud to run their websites, rather than spin up their own servers.  While these platforms make websites easier to manage, they are particularly vulnerable to these attacks. A hacker could theoretically spin up a server using the same hardware as a cryptocurrency startup running operations on such a cloud platform and suddenly have access to all of their data.  In the crypto world, a hacker could hypothetically use this attack vector to steal private keys.  On the one hand, many of the most popular cloud platforms quickly unrolled fixes. On the other hand, researchers worry that deep-rooted vulnerabilities could spawn unfixed variants, with possible lingering effects to come.
