42431974,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8g7h,1591051803,"‘Sell in May’ Wall Street Adage Doesn’t Apply to Bitcoin, Data Suggests","The old Wall Street maxim “Sell in May and go away” is detrimental to bitcoin investors, market data from Messari suggests.      The largest cryptocurrency generated positive returns during eight of the past 10 Mays, outperforming its monthly average for that year during six of them.      “Sell in May” refers to an old investment strategy that advises against holding investments during summer months, starting in May. While there may be truth to the adage for traditional markets, some bitcoin investors don’t give the idea much credence.      “It’s just a meme to me,” said Qiao Wang, a cryptocurrency startup investor and former quantitative trader at Tower Research.      Read More: Bitcoin News Roundup for June 1, 2020      In May of last year, for example, bitcoin’s price gained more than 54% while the 2019 monthly average return was less than 8%. Bitcoin climbed almost 9% last month, just above the year-to-date monthly average of roughly 8.5%.      “It seems clear to me that you want to buy in May and go away,” Wang said of bitcoin.      During bearish cycles in 2015 and 2018, bitcoin performed worse in May than the year’s monthly average. But in 2011, during the cryptocurrency’s first bearish cycle, May returns outshined the year’s monthly average by 120 percentage points.      Nonetheless, market sayings like “Sell in May,” while lacking supporting fundamentals, often become self-fulfilling or are just simply the results of a statistical anomaly, said Sam Trabucco, a quantitative cryptocurrency trader at Alameda Research.      Speaking to bitcoin’s historical outperformance in May, Trabucco said, “I don’t see a reason to believe this particular pattern is anything but variance.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/01/sell-in-may-wall-street-adage-doesnt-apply-to-bitcoin-data-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3697ebd065b08249ba5ac73af83be215e91a4a1-2560x1986.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431971,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8fzh,1591050924,Chinese Chip Maker With a Hand in Crypto Mining Plans $2.8B IPO,"Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), one of the largest computing chip producers in China, plans to raise $2.8 billion through an initial public offering on the Sci-Tech Board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE).      The exchange has accepted SMIC’s application, according to a document filed Monday with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), where it is already listed. The company said part of the proceeds will be focused on developing 14nm chips, which will be used for crypto mining.      The move comes just two months after the company announced a partnership with crypto miner maker Canaan Creative. The two companies plan to develop a mining machine for an undisclosed cryptocurrency with a relatively small market cap, rather than bitcoin due to current technical limitations.      Read More: Canaan Reports $5.6M Loss in Q1 Despite Bitcoin Miner Price Cut      SMIC’s chip-making capabilities still lag behind Bitmain’s major chip supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), as well as Samsung, which works closely with Whatsminer and MicroBT. For example, Samsung has announced its intention to mass-produce 8nm chips in the first quarter, while TSMC is developing 5nm chips.      Founded in mainland China in 2000, SMIC could be one of China’s best hopes to advance its chip-making technologies and become less dependent on manufacturers that have deeper connections with the U.S. government amid increasing tension between the two countries.      Strong support from the Chinese government can put SMIC on the fast track to catch up with its competitors. The company has received substantial financial windfalls since the U.S. put forward new restrictions that could limit chip-makers such as TSMC and Samsung from manufacturing chips for Chinese tech conglomerate Huawei.      Read More: Bitcoin Mining Hardware War Is Heating Up Ahead of the Halving      The Sci-Tech Innovation Board of the SSE, where SMIC wants to go public, went live last June in Shanghai. The new market is touted to be part of China’s capital market reform and support technology companies that are in line with national strategies.      SMIC also received a $2.2 billion investment in May from National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund II and Shanghai Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund II, which are two of the largest national investment funds.      The government fund came as the U.S. Department of Commerce expanded a restriction known as the Foreign Direct Product Rule to make it harder for China to import chips from Samsung and TSMC.

42431983,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8gNh,1591043919,"Market Wrap: As Bitcoin Steadies, Oil’s Turmoil Continues","Both bitcoin and oil were relatively calm Monday, but that when it comes to volatility over the past couple of months it’s crude, the backbone of global industrialization, that’s seeing wilder swings as of late.      Bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands around $9,575 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), gaining less than a percent over the previous 24 hours. Despite a small rally of around $250 on Sunday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization still spent much of the weekend in the mid-$9,000s.      “We are still waiting on a breakout above $10,055 as a positive catalyst,” said Katie Stockton, an analyst at Fairfield Strategies. Stockton sees signs of price appreciation in the near-term. “There is an upturn in one of my preferred gauges that suggests this week will have a bullish bias within the framework of neutral short-term momentum and positive intermediate-term momentum.”      The wait-and-see approach for traders to get over $10,000 bitcoin hump continues. In the meantime, traders have pointed to increased excitement in the oil markets over the past two months.      Jose Llisterri, co-founder of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Interdax, says geopolitical tensions, combined with economic issues related to the coronavirus pandemic, have created a truly unique situation for crude. Oil is climbing 1% with a barrel of crude at $35 as of press time.      The Russia-Saudi Arabia price war, combined with the COVID-19 pandemic, have immensely impacted oil’s roller coaster, ride Llisterri told CoinDesk. “All these events are still playing out, so unless they are fully resolved markets should expect sudden swings in prices. These events have attracted many crypto traders who are lured into volatile markets.”      Read More: Iran Issues License for Nation’s Biggest Bitcoin Mining Operation      While bitcoin has gyrated from as high as $10,081 to as low at $3,866 since March, oil’s price has been more rocky. In fact, oil has been much more volatile than bitcoin since April, with the spot price for crude as high as $48.56 and as low as $0.04 since March.      David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at TradeStation Group, a brokerage firm, says bitcoin’s fundamental aspects are very distinct from the crude markets. “Bitcoin couldn’t be more different than oil. It has limited supply, which just got even smaller because of halving. Crypto markets also had their last big volatility storm in 2018 and have been getting calmer since.”      Indeed, in 2020, the bitcoin rollercoaster has had nothing on oil.      The high volatility of production, demand and supply is weighing on crude markets, affecting its price tremendously, Russell noted to CoinDesk. “One has finite supply (bitcoin), while the other has a long history of gluts and overproduction (oil).”    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mixed on Monday.

42431975,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8g9h,1591039567,Meet the US Senate Candidate Who's Invested in Bitcoin Since 2013,"Cynthia Lummis was the U.S. Representative for Wyoming from 2009 to 2017 and is now running for U.S. Senate. A budget hawk and founding member of the Freedom Caucus, she first bought bitcoin in 2013 after a tip from her son-in-law. She’s been an advocate ever since.      A rancher with sandy blonde hair and a warm chuckle, Lummis spoke over the phone while she was looking out her window at hundreds of heads of steer. Birds were chirping in the background. We discussed what is a good store-of-value, how she thinks about her digital assets and running a senate campaign in the midst of a pandemic. “Each of those cattle,"" she said, pointing outside, ""they’ve decreased by over $400 a piece because of coronavirus. We need stores of value that are decoupled from the economy.”      This interview has been edited for length and clarity.      Wyoming is leading the country in integrating blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies into its banking and regulatory frameworks. What interested you in these technologies to begin with?      I served eight years as Wyoming state treasurer and so I got to invest Wyoming’s Permanent Mineral Trust Fund. It's essentially a sovereign wealth fund. I was always trying to do was find something that was a good store-of-value. Largely through my son-in-law Will Cole and his friends I learned about bitcoin as a store-of-value. I bought my first bitcoin in 2013.      See also: Most Influential 2019 - Caitlin Long      Wow, so a pretty good time to do so.      Oh my god, yes, I think it was about $320 for a bitcoin that time. I've watched it mature as a store-of-value. I’ve watched the fundamentals of bitcoin play out as something that has scarcity built into it, with only 21 million bitcoin being issued. That scarcity, which under economic theory should store value, has done so. The more I watched it since originally buying, the more I've come to believe that those overarching economic principles that underlie Bitcoin are playing out the way that one would hope and expect they would. As a person who's always looking for a store-of-value, I'm impressed with that.      I'm a budget, debt and deficit hawk. I've watched us print money and avoid the scarcity principle by printing more and more money and watching the value of the dollar decline as a result of that. Alternatives to fiat currency are ready for primetime. This is the 21st century. Fiat currency may be on the decline, and I believe that cryptocurrencies may be on the uptick. We were seeing that dynamic play out more quickly because of coronavirus.    As long as a dollar-based digital currency is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S, as opposed to something more scarce, I don’t think it can add value.    As China moves ahead with a digital yuan, should the U.S. be pursuing a digital dollar so we aren’t falling behind?      I don't know that a government-issued currency is going to be necessary. As long as a dollar-based digital currency is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S., as opposed to something more scarce, then I don’t think it can add value. But maybe the goal of a digital dollar is not to store value but a matter of convenience, and it's a matter of avoiding the ridiculous fees associated with having a non-digital fiat based currency. So, there may be consumer benefits to having a digital dollar that I have not fully explored.      See also: Yang 2020 and the Search for the Next Crypto Candidate      How viable are blockchain and cryptocurrencies as issues for a candidate's platform today? I noticed they weren’t mentioned on your website.      I have not talked about them as much as I think about them. That needs to change. The Wyoming legislature has been so advanced in its thinking about these issues. People like Caitlin Long, Will Cole and Parker Lewis are furthering Wyoming's embrace of digital and cryptocurrency platforms. We are in this unique position. I need to talk about it more because these areas are going to become an important component of Wyoming's contribution to advancing a whole variety of technologies that will set us free going forward.      I was in South Carolina covering the primary before the pandemic and many people I spoke to said they wanted to hear the candidates plans and thoughts on issues like cryptocurrencies. How would engage on this in Washington?      I would hope that I can be part of that in the U.S. Senate and find allies and other people who are interested. I don't know how many members of the Senate are as pessimistic as I am about the future of fiat currency. That will be something I want to explore with members of the Senate when I get there and find out if not, then why not.      Why do you think we can keep raising the debt ceiling and printing money without it having an effect on the value of the U.S. dollar and its ability to protect people?      My generation, the Baby Boomers, are going into retirement, only to see their life savings become less valuable every day. Isn't it better to acknowledge that circumstances within our control, meaning overspending, followed by a coronavirus that resulted in overspending by necessity, has now put us into such a deep hole that we need to explore alternatives to fiat currency?      The idea of a digital dollar was raised briefly in the context of the stimulus bill to send money directly to Americans. Would you have preferred to see an approach like that to get money to people quickly?      I don’t have any criticism of how the president and Congress handled this rapid response to the coronavirus. They truly didn't have time to create the architecture for efficient distribution of these payments digitally. If that architectural framework had been in existence prior to this crisis, we would have been in a different situation. So now that we have the benefit of hindsight, creating that architecture as a means to more efficiently address crises and the delivery of benefits via the social safety net really may be one of the silver linings of having gone through this.      So did you hold on to that first bitcoin?      Yes, I am a HODLer. I've never sold. I was and am a buyer. I feel like that will always be the case for me. Because, going back to my store-of-value means of investing and diversifying, I want to have a diversified asset allocation. I want some assets that produce no income to me, but I can hold as a store-of-value. For someone my age who has other investments that are more vulnerable to our current economy I am delighted to have one that seems a little bit decoupled from our current economy.      Looking at my own day-to-day business as a rancher and seeing how coronavirus affected my role in the traditional economy, I want to find ways in the non-traditional economy to protect my personal future and that of other Americans.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/01/meet-the-us-senate-candidate-whos-invested-in-bitcoin-since-2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8d0e1b292c5b36a66007dcfcc5df622279491af-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This episode is sponsored by Bitstamp and Ciphertrace.      Cities around the country have been engulfed in protest in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man. There is an intense battle for the narrative around the protests. Are they legitimate outcries against institutional racism and police brutality? Is the looting covertly being driven by white supremacists on the one hand or Antifa on the other?      In the Bitcoin community, some have plumbed the “Bitcoin Fixes This” meme to argue that the core underlying issue has to do with a monetary system that structurally creates inequality. Others have clapped back against pushing that meme in this moment.      See also: 'Minsky Moments' and the Financial History of Pandemics      In this episode of The Breakdown, NLW looks at:    What bitcoiners are trying to say when they apply the “Bitcoin Fixes This” meme to this moment.  Why the current system structurally exacerbates inequality.  Why the meme fails to capture additional economic, political and power dimensions of what’s going on.  Why the meme in this moment might feel so out of place as to inspire the opposite of its intended effect: turning people away from bitcoin rather than making them want to learn more.  Why Satoshi’s “If you don’t get it, I don’t have time to explain it to you” quote is the most misused and abused of his sayings.  Why complexity and nuance, not memes, are needed now.

Meanwhile, a new report shows that a million “timelocked” bitcoin transactions are open to a hypothetical exploit, while CoinKite has unveiled a new way to recharge hardware wallets.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top Shelf    Chase Class Action Chase Bank has agreed to repay most of $2.5 million in fees customers say it unfairly charged for cryptocurrency transactions. A subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase, the bank has agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit resulting from the bank’s decision in 2018 to charge higher fees on Chase credit cards that had classified the crypto purchases as “cash advances.”      Timelock Fault In a new report, pseudonymous engineer 0xb10c found more than a million of “time-locked” bitcoin transactions made between September 2019 and March 2020 were not accurately enforced by the network, increasing the risk of a hypothetical form of attack in which miners could essentially steal bitcoin from other miners. The bug affects 10% of time-locked transactions, or 2% of bitcoin transactions overall.      Beauty Startups and Crypto There are growing similarities between makeup startups and crypto communities, which are dominated by influencer marketing with products sold through direct-to-consumer (DTC) models and aggregated retail platforms like Amazon, Etsy or Shopify. In both startup sectors, users are encouraged to do their own research rather than trust traditional tastemakers like magazines. “I think DeFi and indie/new beauty [entrepreneurs] are very similar in this regard … bringing power to the people, generating opportunities,” decentralized finance (DeFi) user and skincare aficionado María Paula Fernandez said.      Cold Storage CoinKite released Coldpower, a way to charge hardware wallets by connecting the USB plug to a 9-volt battery, rather than plugging it into a laptop. Comparing it to a popular gizmo that prevents accidental data exchange when one device is plugged into another to charge, CoinKite says Coldpower is “like a ‘USB condom,’ but self-powered.”      Crypto Long & Short Several “blue chip” crypto firms – including Coinbase, Genesis Capital and BitGo – have revealed plans to knit new connective systems for crypto trading and investment, and become prime brokers. CoinDesk’s Head of Research Noelle Acheson posits the move might “solve part of the fragmentation of crypto markets by giving investors access to several exchanges via one account.” In turn, this could lead to a new cycle of development and new market participants in the latest Crypto Long & Short newsletter.      From Around the Web    Bitmain has launched a cheaper version of its flagship Antminer, in a bid to regain market share from rival MicroBT.

Russian police arrested the head of a post office for mining crypto. (Decrypt)  “Bitfinex was once the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. But where is it?” begins Cas Piancey and Bennett Tomlin’s excerpted chapter from a forthcoming book about the stablecoin tether. Piancey travels to China to find out.  PwC’s Henri Arslanian: Blockchain auditors to play ‘pivotal role’ in crypto (Finance Magnates)  Opposite Editorial    Why Family Offices Should Consider Digital Assets for Their Portfolios Constantin Kogan, venture partner at BitBull Capital, takes a look at the growing trend of family offices interested in diversifying client portfolios with cryptocurrencies. “Blockchain-based digital assets can be an alternative for investors hoping to reduce reliance on a failing traditional financial system,” he said.      To Get Serious About Decentralization, We Need to Measure It Stephanie Hurder, CoinDesk columnist and economist at Prysm Group, argues for standard frameworks for assessing how decentralized a crypto project is. “Blockchain-based systems are economies written in code. The value of a protocol, and any native tokens, depend on economic fundamentals. As such, users, validators and investors benefit from a standard set of measures that gauge these fundamentals and evaluate whether systems are working as intended,” she writes.    Market Intel    Ether's Gains Bitcoin has entered the seasonally bullish month of June on a positive note, but its recent gains look pale compared to that of ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. Bitcoin rose by over 8% last week and ended May with a 9.5% gain. Meanwhile, ether’s price rose by 16% last week and 12% for the month of May.      Breakout Token The ZRX token from 0x, a developer at the forefront of the fast-evolving landscape for decentralized exchanges, surged 67% in May to become the month’s top-performing digital asset. ZRX’s May surge took the token’s price to the highest in almost a year, though the current price of about 32 cents is still down some 87% from the all-time high of $2.50 reached in January 2018, according to data provider Messari. The rise follows protocol updates and a beta launch of a new trading platform.

42431967,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8frh,1591024583,Bitcoin Is a Big Opportunity for Investors in the Debt-Fueled Roaring Twenties,"David G Leibowitz is Global Macro Portfolio Manager, CIO Lebo Capital Management, and co-founder of LeboBTC Ledger Group.      I started my 39-year career as a Wall Street trader in the summer of 1981, watching the end (or the beginning, depending on your point of view) of the debt super-cycle, as Fed Chair Paul Volker raised the Federal Funds rate to 20% to cripple the 1970s energy-led inflationary spiral. Central bank actions – the raising and lowering of interest rates to fuel lagging economies or tame overly strong ones – were the backbone of my ability to identify trends, articulate value and manage risk.      That invaluable input is now dead, crushed by the “too big to fail” policies of former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s response to the Great Recession, decimated by The European Central Bank’s (ECB) Mario Draghi’s 2012 “whatever it takes” framework, and finally buried by current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s March, 2020 suggestion that the Fed would provide essentially unlimited lending to support the economy ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.      See also: As This Crisis Worsens, Bitcoin Will Become a Safe Haven Again      Today’s global Central Bank policy is understood as Modern Monetary Theory, an accommodation of fiat governments’ financial demands met by simply moving a decimal point on an infinite balance sheet of government debt. The global debt load has now exceeded a tipping point: interest rates will not be allowed to rise from near zero as the governments of the world can never afford to pay higher interest on their debt, let alone the debt itself. It’s official: the emperor has no clothes.      Unlike the V-shaped recovery of the 2008 Great Recession, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely prove to be the biggest shock the global economy has ever seen. The world’s foremost economists are expecting the recovery to take an L-shape, elapsing over a multi-year time frame, regardless of the unlimited money printing of the central banks. Unemployment is likely to stay high for an extended period of time, and in the coming “new normal”, many jobs aren’t coming back.      All of that said, I am not despondent. Taking Chairman Powell at his word, government actions addressing this pandemic are likely to be unlimited. It’s reasonable to envision FDR-type projects involving infrastructure spending and reorganization of supply chains, regardless of the results of the November 2020 U.S. election. And, as desperate times call for desperate measures, one policy response, adopted by the Bank of Japan in 2010, was to allow the Central Bank to buy ETFs.    With the destruction of the fixed income markets, the search for investable alpha has already begun    On April 6, Janet Yellen, former Chairman of the Fed, said in an interview that perhaps, “Congress should reconsider the powers that the Fed has with respect to assets it can own.” If the American government steps in and supports the stock market through direct purchases of stocks or ETFs, the crisis may not be solved, but a floor would be put under the equity market.      With global interest rates for government “guaranteed” debt near zero (or negative), the asset class that was fixed income has disappeared. The implications are staggering. Investment portfolios, which have historically held a split of fixed income and equity investments with a balance based on risk orientation and horizon, are now scrambling to replace lost yield. With the bond markets of the world fully priced, fixed income assets that still have a modicum of yield (such as high yield and emerging market debt) have a risk profile more like that of a stock than a cash flow consistent with secure fixed income returns. Where will capital find returns in the 2020s?    Portfolio Reallocations    Certain investment implications seem obvious. The stock market, once it finds a floor, should mount a rally like it did coming out of the Great Recession. In today’s case, there are potentially three pillars of equity support: the fiat printing presses that are working overtime; monies coming out of fully priced fixed income assets; and the potential of government-sanctioned equity purchases. Should this prove accurate, historical highs in stock P/E ratios will likely get dwarfed in the coming equity investment rush.      What of alternative assets? Real estate, the historical ‘first’ of alternatives, is getting disrupted by an evolving work-at-home cultural shift, and by the new demands of social distancing which will reshape commercial capacity in store fronts, restaurants, hotels, theaters, stadiums, etc. That said, ultra-low interest rates should benefit the real estate sector over time.      Gold, a 5,000-year-old store of wealth, should make new highs (above $2,000/oz.) as a safe haven of portfolio diversification, as an acknowledgment of the accelerating debasement of all fiat currencies, and as a hedge against inflation and the fear of social unrest. And last but hardly least, cryptocurrency, and in particular, Bitcoin.    Bitcoin    Bitcoin was created in 2008 through a much lauded white paper. In the height of the Great Recession, failures in the banking system gave birth to a new (strictly digital) asset class called cryptocurrency.      Cryptocurrency is the third stage in the evolution of the Internet, following email and the web browser. Analogous to email (a free, 24x7 messaging rail on the Internet), Bitcoin (BTC) is a free, peer-to-peer payment rail that works using the internet, 24/7. It has been described by some as e-cash, digital currency and digital gold, representing a store of wealth independent of the banking system.      Bitcoin is a store of always accessible money, divisible out to eight decimal places. With any mobile device or computer, users can access their digital funds, stored on the Internet, from anywhere in the world. Bitcoin owners are in essence their own bank. With just a password in one’s head, physical borders can be crossed without fear of confiscation of one’s wealth.      Bitcoin is a hedge against the debasement of fiat currencies by governments and their Central Banks. Its construct has a finite supply (only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be created) and hence it is a digitally scarce asset, and an inflation hedge. At the time of writing, with a market cap of $165 billion at around $9,000/BTC, it has an estimated 50 million users/investors, and approximately $30 billion moves on the Bitcoin blockchain daily.      As a young technology, Bitcoin has an extraordinary 10+ year track record. There have been a number of observers that have posited that Bitcoin should have at least a 1% allocation to all investment portfolios. If a balanced investment portfolio of stocks and bonds had a 5% allocation to Bitcoin from 2015 through 2019, the portfolio would have doubled its performance.      Bitcoin has been called Gold 2.0. It may prove to be a better store of value than gold as the shiny metal is expensive to buy, expensive to store, expensive to transport, and unusable as an everyday currency. The market cap of gold (at $1,700/oz.) is approximately $9 trillion. Should Bitcoin’s market cap reach 10% that of gold’s, a single bitcoin would be worth $42,000. Should it become equal to that of gold, a bitcoin would be worth $428,000/BTC.    Looking ahead    With the destruction of the fixed income markets, the search for investable alpha has already begun. The banking system has lost an asset class that represented a huge share of its annual fees. Bitcoin, young and maturing quickly, is already being offered to select clients by several global asset managers and international banks.      It’s when, not if the asset class that cryptocurrency goes mainstream. Bitcoin hit its high in December, 2017 at $20,000/BTC. With accelerated adoption, the current entry point of roughly $9k/BTC seems like a value proposition.      The security concerns of hacking and theft are disappearing quickly as major cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians are beginning to offer insurance, and some are offering interest on digital assets held on their platforms. The value of bitcoin as a secure (and stable) investment is being re-analyzed in light of the recent equity and energy selloffs and the ongoing debasement of fiat currencies, a negative store of value.      See also: Bitcoin Is a Safe Haven for a Worse Storm Than This      There are no sure things in life (or investing) and headwinds still exist for the cryptocurrency markets, such as defined regulation and taxation by the bodies politic. That said, Japan, Switzerland, and India amongst others have already begun to lay the groundwork for global definition. The U.S., which is behind the curve, has defined Bitcoin as property and not as a security, and further clarity is expected. There are active futures contracts in Bitcoin, and the CFTC just sanctioned a sixth derivatives platform. With expected institutional demand on the immediate horizon, the case for an investment in the cryptocurrency market is strong and getting stronger.      COVID-19 has put an exclamation point on the end of the interest rate super-cycle. The elimination of fixed income as an investable asset class hastened the death of global macro investing, which has been dying since the introduction of negative interest rates by the ECB in 2014. Alpha is hard to come by and there simply aren’t enough assets to trade and arbitrage anymore.

42431968,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8fth,1591023600,Alibaba Claims Patented Cross-Chain System Is Better Than Cosmos,"Alibaba says its ""unified domain name scheme"" would simplify and improve communication between blockchains.      In a patent granted by the U.S. Patent Office (patent no. 10,666,445) last Tuesday, the e-commerce giant said its domain name system could enable cross-chain communications that are more simple and seamless than on existing interoperability solutions, specifically naming blockchain interoperability project Cosmos.      Alibaba says that assigning universally recognizable domain names to blockchains, or parts of a blockchain, could enable better identification and interaction with others in a broader network, in much the same way that entities recognize and communicate with one another using domain names, such as "".com"" or "".org.""      Also read: ‘One Network, Many Chains’ – The Case for Blockchain Interoperability      The problem with existing systems, suggests the patent, is they can become clunky and cumbersome. Cosmos, for example, requires that each blockchain retains separate identifications for each and every link it holds with another blockchain. These can't be reused and that means the ID system only has ""a local scope.""      But Alibaba says, in its simpler system, blockchains only need one domain name – a unified blockchain domain name (UBCDN) – recognizable and valid in any and all communication it has with other chains. It also means it can communicate with other systems without having to hold onto an ever-expanding address book of specific identifications.      ""[U]nlike existing cross-chain implementations such as COSMOS ... the UBCDN can be used and is recognizable globally by all blockchain instances in the unified blockchain network, despite how many relay chains [network links] are included in the unified blockchain network,"" reads the patent.      Alibaba has filed a raft of blockchain-related patents on a wide-ranging number of use cases. In December 2019, it won a patent that would make consortium networks – private systems operated and controlled by a handful of select entities – faster and safer to use.      See also: Alibaba Patents Blockchain System That Spots Music Copycats      A patent doesn't necessarily mean a company will move ahead with implementation. As such it isn't clear if Alibaba has any active plans to launch its domain name system at any point.      A possible real-world home for Alibaba's newly patented domain name scheme could be the blockchain platform for its subsidiary Ant Financial, which was unveiled back in November.      In the patent filing, the company says the system was designed with a consortium network in mind. It also includes a feature enabling human-readable names which, the company suggests, could make it easier for entities to more readily identify themselves.

42431969,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8fvh,1591016400,Maker of Coldcard Bitcoin Wallet Rolls Out an Extra-Strength 'USB Condom',"The comedian Dennis Miller once joked about computer viruses, ""When you link up to another computer, you're linking up to every computer that that computer has ever linked up to."" If so, CoinKite, maker of the Coldcard hardware wallet, has invented an extra-strength prophylactic for bitcoin investors.      The startup just released Coldpower, which allows users to charge their hardware wallets by connecting the USB plug to a 9-volt battery, rather than, say, plugging it into a laptop. Comparing it to a popular gizmo that prevents accidental data exchange when one device is plugged into another to charge, CoinKite says Coldpower is “like a ‘USB condom,’ but self-powered.”      “We want to help protect people from 'bad USB' attacks by facilitating air-gap use of their Coldcard,"" CoinKite CEO Rodolfo Novak said. ""Air-gapped"" use means not connecting a device to the internet.      Simultaneously, CoinKite rolled out Seedplate, a metal plate for engraving a recovery seed, which is like an emergency password for accessing bitcoin. Since the phrase is carved in metal, there's less risk of it being lost or damaged than if written on a piece of paper. Novak called it a “backup of last resort.”      Taken together, these products underscore the idiosyncratic risks of cryptocurrency, which, although digital, is arguably a bearer asset like physical cash. Once a private key for cryptocurrency is stolen, the coins are likely gone for good. The holder of the private key is responsible for keeping it secure, and the required precautionary mindset often borders on paranoia.      Read More: How to Store Your Bitcoin      Hardware wallets like Coldcard, Opendime, Ledger or Trezor are considered one of the most secure ways of storing bitcoin private keys since they are devices that are stored offline and are less susceptible to hacks. But even when using them, there are obscure ways bitcoins can be hacked or lost.      ""Our ultimate goal at Coinkite is to make all aspects of HODLing safer,"" Novak said, referencing the ""hodl"" meme, a misspelling of ""hold,"" used as a shorthand for the act of storing bitcoin and waiting to see how the novel digital currency fares over the years.      In April, Novak gave a talk spotlighting his ""disdain"" for the USB standard for connections between hardware jacks at a virtual reality meetup. The standard is centralized, he said, and thousands of pages long, so ""no one can get through them."" He listed many attacks that can be used with the connection tool.      Not even a simple power adapter can be trusted, according to Novak. ""There are many USB hacks and someone could make an evil power adapter/bank or an evil cable,” he said.

Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, rose by over 8% last week and ended May with a 9.5% gain. That came after bitcoin jumped by nearly 35% in April, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Meanwhile, ether’s price rose by 16% last week and 12% for the month of May. Growth in ether’s non-price metrics, too, has been impressive compared to those for bitcoin.      For instance, the seven-day moving average of active ether addresses stood at 12-month high of 337,986 on Sunday, according to data provided by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. While ether’s active addresses have risen by more than 10% over the last two weeks, active bitcoin addresses declined by nearly 5%.      On a more positive note, bitcoin outshone major traditional assets in May. Gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, rallied by 2% over the month. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major currencies, fell by over 0.5% and the S&P 500 index rose by 4.5%.      Analysts expect both bitcoin and ether to maintain their bullish momentum over the near-term. While seasonality is positive for bitcoin in June, supporting the case for an extension of its two-month winning streak, ether is likely to benefit from Ethereum's upcoming switch to the proof-of-stake mechanism.    Looking forward    Bitcoin has put in a positive June performance in six out of the last eight years. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has printed gains in the second quarter also in six out of the last eight years, as discussed previously.      Macro factors, too, are supportive of continued gains in bitcoin, according to analysts.      “Global tensions and uncertainties that have intensified over the past week and further support the Bitcoin narrative as an alternative investment to protect downside risks,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.      President Donald Trump on Friday announced new, targeted sanctions against Chinese officials and directed his administration to revoke special trade exemptions for Hong Kong. The move came in retaliation to Beijing's decision to curb Hong Kong's autonomy by imposing a new security law on the city. The tensions could further escalate, as China is now considering plans to halt imports of soy from the U.S.      Dibb also expects the weakness in China’s yuan and the possible introduction of negative interest rates in the U.S. to bode well for bitcoin and precious metals like gold.      “Technically, we are expecting a break of $10,000 over the next two weeks and a further push to $11,000 by July,” Dibb added. Meanwhile, Su Zhu, CEO of Three Arrows Capital, said that, “BTC’s moment will be a clean break of the key round figure of $10,000.”      Indeed, bitcoin has failed multiple times in the last three weeks or so to shake off selling pressure in the range of $9,900 to $10,000. So, a convincing break above the psychological resistance could cause more buyers to join the market, leading to stronger gains.      At press time, the cryptocurrency is trapped in a narrowing price range. The direction in which the range is breached will likely set the tone for the next big move.      A bullish breakout could be seen, as investor sentiment is at its most bullish in years, according to on-chain data. For instance, nearly 60% of bitcoin’s supply hasn’t changed hands in over 12 months, a likely sign investors are holding in expectation of gains, according to Glassnode.      A similar percentage of supply was lying dormant for over a year at the start of the mega bull run in 2016.    Ethereum upgrade may boost price    Ethereum’s impending transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS) in a major upgrade dubbed Ethereum 2.0 likely boded well for ether in May. Buying pressure for the cryptocurrency may remain strong in the near term, with the launch of Eth 2.0 due in Q3, 2020.      “It's hard to be bearish with Ethereum staking coming soon. I suspect there will be a lot more ether staked than the projected 10-30 million. Perhaps even 50 million-plus if a lot of people select to stake through exchanges/rocket pool,” tweeted David Schwartz, a senior software engineer at Nash, a decentralized exchange.      Staking rewards network participants for holding coins, in a similar way to earning interest on savings.      The sharp rise in the number of addresses holding 32 ETH or more, an amount a holder is required to maintain as a balance to become a validator on Eth 2.0 (and hence earn staking rewards), suggests investors are accumulating coins in preparation for the upgrade.      Technical charts suggest that ether could continue to outperform bitcoin, too. The MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and trend reversals, has crossed above zero on the ether-bitcoin monthly chart for the first time on record, as noted by popular analyst and engineer @IamCryptoWolf on Twitter.      The MACD’s move above zero indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change in the ETH/BTC exchange rate. Put simply, the market expects ether to fare better than bitcoin.      Lennix Lai, director of financial markets at cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, expects bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market to benefit from the increased investor interest in ether. “The upcoming ETH 2.0 [upgrade] shall encourage more people to stake ETH and ultimately benefit the sentiments of the crypto market as a whole,"" said Lai.

Basic Attention Token (BAT) had the second-best performance, with an 18% return in May, according to CoinDesk Research.      Bitcoin ranked third with an 11% gain for the month. The largest cryptocurrency by market value traded in a range between about $8,500 and $10,000 for most of May, ending at about $9,500.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Among the worst-performing tokens was XRP from Ripple, which slid 5.6% on the month to 20 cents. Bitcoin SV (BSV) lost 7.4%, falling to $192.      ZRX's May surge took the token's price to the highest in almost a year, though the current price of about 32 cents is still down some 87% from the all-time-high of $2.50 reached in January 2018, according to data provider Messari.      The 0x project, which is led by co-founder and CEO Will Warren and raised the equivalent of $24 million in a token sale in 2017, specializes in software that can be used to create DEXs – essentially automated trading systems that can be maintained and operated with distributed computing networks.      0x upgraded its protocol in December of last year to aggregate liquidity from on-chain sources like Uniswap, Oasis and Kyber. At the time, analysis firm Delphi Digital described the change in a report as a ""step in the right direction.""      In a March follow-up report, Delphi noted that the protocol had seen steady trade-volume growth since the upgrade took effect, mostly driven by non-fungible tokens (which can be given different attributes and are used for crypto collectibles) trading on TokenTrove.      Last month, 0x announced a second-quarter beta launch of a new trading platform, Matcha, that the company says has been ""built to feel natural, intuitive, and highlight the convenience of peer-to-peer crypto trading.""      Denis Vinokourov, head of research for the crypto prime broker Bequant, said in emailed comments that the token may be getting some support from its weekly staking payouts – which are rewards for holding tokens, akin to interest.      According to Bitcoin Insider, the 0x community voted May 7 in favor of a proposal that would cut the time period between staking payouts from 10 days to seven.      And the ZRX token enjoyed a steep one-day pop earlier this month when Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin remarked that 0x was ""one of the projects he wants to try out,"" according to the publication.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,544 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,635 | 24-Hr Low: $9,394      Trend: Bitcoin jumped over 8% last week, erasing a major portion of the double-digit price drop seen in the preceding week.      The outlook, however, remains neutral with the cryptocurrency still trapped in a 3.5-week-long narrowing price range, or contracting triangle, as seen on the daily chart.      A UTC close above the triangle resistance at $9,835 would indicate a resumption of the rally from the March low of $3,867 and open the doors to re-test of the February high of $10,500. Alternatively, a move under the lower end of the triangle at $8,890 would confirm a bearish reversal and potentially allow a test of the 200-day average at $8,070.      Some chart analysts argue that the longer duration charts (monthly and weekly) have turned bullish. ""Great month for Bitcoin, as it broke above previous resistance,"" tweeted popular analyst Josh Rager after the cryptocurrency ended Sunday at $9,446.      Meanwhile, on the weekly chart, the cryptocurrency has cleared the resistance of the trendline falling from June 2019 and February 2020 highs. Add to that a golden crossover on the daily chart and the path of least resistance appears to be to the higher side. As such, the cryptocurrency may end the 3.5-week-long contracting triangle with a bullish breakout.      Rager, however, warned that the bullish May close could turn out to be a trap for buyers and stronger evidence of a bull revival would be a weekly close above $10,713.      Further, the cryptocurrency fell 2.5% on Sunday, forming a bearish ""inside day"" candle and aborting the upward move from last Monday's low of $8,630.      Technical traders usually wait for confirmation of a trend change in the form of a negative follow-through to the inside day candle, meaning, a stronger selling pressure could emerge if prices drop below Sunday's low of $9,370 over the next 24 hours.",POSITIVE,BAT | BTC | ZRX,BAT | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/01/first-mover-0xs-zrx-token-surged-67-in-may-to-become-months-top-performer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d91c092ab50d1232bef1f7f303f2b353fd319f6-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm's debit card is not prepaid like many other crypto debit cards, but instead links directly to a customer’s Xapo hot wallet. On Xapo’s platform, bitcoin transfers to external accounts don’t incur additional charges beyond miner fees, and there are no fees at all for transactions between Xapo accounts.  Xapo was created after Casares first acquired bitcoin in 2011 and created a vault in which to store it. Upon receiving requests from his friends, and later institutions, asking to store their bitcoin in his vault, he decided to found the company.  In 2014, Xapo received Series A funding of $40 million from investors including PayPal cofounder Max Levchin, Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang, Index Ventures and Benchmark Capital. At the time, this was a record-breaking funding round in the crypto industry. The company's institutional business was acquired by crypto exchange Coinbase for a reported $55 million in 2019.

Both are dominated by influencer marketing with products sold through direct-to-consumer (DTC) models and aggregated retail platforms like Amazon, Etsy or Shopify.      In emerging markets without direct access to Amazon, Lebanese bitcoiner Michel Haber said grassroots traders often fill the role of educating clients and helping them procure their first wallets. Social media accounts and chat groups become ad hoc retail networks.      Read more: Michelle Phan: The Beauty of Bitcoin      When it comes to grassroots distribution strategies, few mainstream industries offer a better precedent for the nascent cryptocurrency space than small beauty businesses, according to decentralized finance (DeFi) user and skincare aficionado María Paula Fernandez.      In both startup sectors, users are encouraged to do their own research rather than trust traditional tastemakers like magazines.      “I think DeFi and indie/new beauty [entrepreneurs] are very similar in this regard … bringing power to the people, generating opportunities,” she said. “There is no harm in learning about what’s in your beauty products. ... It benefited consumers as well, as some of them can become influencers and broadcast their knowledge for compensation.”      Likewise, Fernandez said, she now looks for beauty products and crypto tools in similar ways. She builds up her own expertise, learning together with loved ones who work in the skincare industry, while also following influencers with professional experience in the field. So far, in the crypto industry, hardware wallet sellers predominantly rely on digital word-of-mouth. Much like the beauty marketing strategies on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, this includes sending products to crypto influencers to review and make instructional guides.      This typically matures into a referral marketing strategy that leverages these same fan groups.      For example, Iva Fiserova, head of communications at the Trezor wallet-maker SatoshiLabs, said the startup collaborates with social media influencers on “affiliate marketing activities” rather than paying influencers to advertise.      A few exchanges, like Binance and Gemini, have already proved successful with the referral model, which has worked for decades for multilevel marketing companies like Avon and Mary Kay cosmetics. As such, the Instagram micro-influencer Chjango Unchained, who works at Cosmos developer Tendermint during the day, said she’s been earning pocket money through the Gemini referral link in her Instagram bio for a few months.      If her fans use that link to sign up and buy more than $100 in crypto, she receives $10 in bitcoin.      “I just see people on Instagram doing it,” she said of promoting brands through her Instagram, where she started featuring professional portraits with brand tags in 2019. “I wanted people who ask me about crypto to use Gemini instead of Coinbase because Coinbase’s fees are insane.”      It remains to be seen how these marketing strategies will scale during the coronavirus recession.    YouTube giveaways    “We sometimes get in touch with [users] to help them engage their followers by doing giveaways and joining campaigns,” Fiserova said of SatoshiLabs’ influencer strategy.      Unlike beauty brands, which look for experienced influencers with established followings, crypto brands are more likely to help users become influencers.      Fiserova said her company has sold hundreds of thousands of Trezor wallets this way, working with “the community” to create a brand that users love so much the hardware seller “does not need to pay for advertising.”      “We have seen a growing demand for our products in the past three months,” Fiserova said. “There were some shipment issues in some markets, which we managed to resolve, so our customers would get their devices on time.”      Rodolfo Novak, co-founder of the hardware seller Coinkite, said he’s also seen an uptick in demand since the coronavirus crisis began.      “Our sales are increasing week by week,” Novak said, declining to specify how many devices other than to say it is now comparable to the French wallet startup Ledger, which sold more than 1.8 million wallets to date, according to a Ledger spokesperson. Novak added his company sent more than 50 hardware products to YouTube reviewers over the past three years. In terms of community, the company’s Telegram group has roughly 773 members. This is their primary marketing strategy.      “We find our users help other users,” Novak said. “If we added the cost of education [marketing] that would make our product more expensive.”      Even this small niche has proved profitable for Coinkite, which operates its own factory and DTC distribution. In the beauty industry, DTC startups are often acquired by larger brands or start more traditional ad campaigns as they grow. When it comes to crypto, so far it appears larger companies rely on sponsoring niche content creators. Because, after all, free products don’t pay the bills.    Sponsorships and referrals    The most successful crypto influencers generally seek to spin their star power into media startups.      This may someday be the case for bitcoin podcaster Marty Bent, whose show is sponsored by Unchained Capital and Square’s Cash App. For now, Bent described his podcast and newsletter as an educational “passion project,” in addition to working at the bitcoin company Great American Mining. Bent said he rejects several prospective advertisers a month because he’s not in a rush to build a sustainable podcast business.      “I wouldn’t be against advertising for a company that isn’t a bitcoin company, as long as I like and believe in the product,” Bent said. “I think content creators, especially if they’re successful in developing an engaged audience, should realize they can be selective and wait for advertisers they and their audiences align with.”      A spokesperson for Cash App declined to comment on the company’s sponsorship strategy, including deals with podcaster Joe Rogan and the Twitter-savvy rapper Lil B. Large companies, like Cash App and the Kraken crypto exchange, focus on sponsoring content creators that monetize their personal brands.      Read more: I Attended a Bitcoin Conference in VR and Still Got Sick      Kraken sponsors two such startups that emerged over the past year, including Reckless VR in April 2020, founded by virtual reality meetup organizer Udi Wertheimer, and podcaster Peter McCormack, who launched his media brand Defiance in 2019. McCormack is one of the few influencers who turned his hobby into a day job, reportedly earning $1 million in revenue last year.      Still, micro-influencers make money through referrals rather than sponsorships. Bent is an unusual case, snagging a mainstream sponsor so early on.      For a more typical example, Michael Gu, who created a Telegram group with more than 3,602 members and a YouTube channel with 203,000 subscribers, said he offers Ledger wallet affiliate links although the hardware company doesn’t sponsor his videos. Since Gu started creating crypto content in 2012 under the Boxmining moniker, he primarily monetizes his social media channels through affiliate links, viewer donations and, until recently, monthly YouTube memberships.      “I don’t view Boxmining as a business that demands monthly profits etc.,” Gu said of his crypto content brand. “We had an increase in donations after coronavirus, especially after the community found out that YouTube demonetized all videos covering the subject.”    Growth strategies    The first lesson crypto brands are learning from their beauty industry predecessors is that influencers must be hyper-specific to drive sales, yet evolve as the audience grows in order to remain relevant.      Companies like the payments startup and debit card provider Crypto.com may leverage their influencer strategies to spin out regional communities, such as Turkish or Russian Telegram groups.      Read more: YouTube Temporarily Bans Two Popular Crypto Channels Claiming Policy Breach      Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said his company already started this process during the demand surge of early 2020, and is now looking for local partners “from universities, to influencers, to payment partners.” Meanwhile, he said the startup’s user base doubled to 2 million people over the past six months.      When it comes to what the company looks for in an influencer, Marszalek said people willing to broadcast themselves “using our product and testing it, introducing it to their audiences.”      “We get more return on investment on that [giveaways and referral bonuses] than Facebook ads,” Marszalek said. “The drop-offs are huge once you ask for know-your-customer information, so it’s an expensive thing to advertise if you don’t have an attractive product with a strong word-of-mouth [reputation].”      It’s clear how crypto companies benefit from focusing their marketing budgets on influencers and community management instead of ads and traditional media coverage. It remains to be seen how this plays into the broader influencer economy.      In the beauty industry, the most successful influencers eventually launch their own product lines. This is much closer to the type of personality cult and product pairing seen with token issuers like Justin Sun of Tron or Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, creator of BNB tokens, than influencer media startups like theSkimm. Much like Sun, other types of influencers also occasionally do cash giveaways for fans on social media. This isn’t unique to crypto.      Will we someday live in a world where fans speculate on a celebrity’s earning potential, like NBA player Spencer Dinwiddie is doing with security tokens?      It’s still exceedingly rare for influencer clout to build a broader media or education business, in any sector, rather than advertise consumable products. The YouTube Queen herself, Michelle Phan, is looking to launch a podcast in 2020 and become an exception to this rule.      In a space where most people get information about financial products through sponsored content, it’s up to consumers to determine whether the influencer is offering unbiased education or propaganda.      Sometimes, marketing can be both. Tron founder Justin Sun sponsored a college campus tour by podcaster Ben Armstrong, aka BitBoy Crypto, in 2019, along with partners at the Blockchain Education Alliance. As for Bent, he’s not aiming to make “a ton of money,” any time soon, nor expand like McCormack.      Since Bent has traditional syndicate experience, from the podcast network Barstool Sports, he isn’t betting on that rare transition from sponsored educator to sustainable outlet.      “My goal is to get quality information about bitcoin into as many minds as possible,” Bent said, referring to his podcast and newsletter as advocacy. “The fact that they are profitable is an added bonus. … Some people may call me an influencer, but that’s not my goal.”",NEUTRAL,BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | WALLET | BNB,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/01/crypto-influencers-are-following-the-beauty-playbook-even-if-they-dont-know-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0105b74181eabd0f90ca0fc4b5aca0112892ac07-2046x1364.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company offers both an investigation software scraping the blockchain for the movements of funds, and a know-your-transaction (KYT) kit intended for businesses to reduce regulatory risks by flagging cryptos that were used in crime or were hacked. Their investigative software platform aims to provide better compliance and enables financial institutions, law enforcement agencies and businesses to identify illicit activity and bad actors related to cryptocurrency.  Chainalysis has received funding from investors including Digital Currency Group and Benchmark Capital. In 2019, the company secured a Series B round of $36 million via Japan’s largest bank MUFG (Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group) and venture firm Accel Partners.  In April of 2019, Chainalysis added four more cryptocurrencies to its transaction monitoring suite. The newly supported tokens included Binance’s BNB token, Circle's USDC, Tether’s USDT and Gemini’s GUSD. These increased the firm's anti-money laundering initiative to tracking 10 currencies, which reportedly represent 85 percent of the top 25 coins by trading volume. Previously, the software had monitored bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, litecoin, paxos, and TrueUSD.  The firm now claims to cover ""90% of all cryptocurrency activity"" on its website.

A subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase, the bank has agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit resulting from the bank's decision in 2018 to charge higher fees on Chase credit cards that had classified the crypto purchases as ""cash advances.""      In March, lead plaintiffs Brady Tucker, Ryan Hilton and Stanton Smith notified the U.S. Southern District Court in New York that they had agreed to a settlement with the defendant, Chase Bank. An order signed by Judge Katherine Polk Failla at the time resulted in court proceedings being discontinued and allowed settlement to proceed.      As reported by Reuters on May 28, in a motion was filed to the Manhattan federal court on May 26, plaintiffs said the settlement will result in class members of the lawsuit receiving about 95% of the fees they allege they were unlawfully charged.      Chase, in turn, will not admit to any wrongdoing to the 62,000 class members as part of the settlement deal, according to the motion.      See also: Telegram Quits Court Fight With SEC Over TON Blockchain Project      ""Chase has agreed to enter into this Agreement to avoid the further expense, inconvenience, and distraction of burdensome and protracted litigation, and to be completely free of any further claims that were asserted or could have been asserted in the Action,"" the motion stated.      The class action was first brought forward in April 2018, when Tucker alleged Chase had charged him more than $160 in fees and interest for regularly purchasing cryptocurrencies from Coinbase using his credit card.

42431964,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8fnh,1590998400,Bug in 'Timelocked' Bitcoin Contracts Could Spur Miners to Steal From Each Other,"A widespread bug has compromised a special type of bitcoin transaction that is supposed to discourage miners from cheating, new research shows.      In a report released in late April, pseudonymous engineer 0xb10c found more than a million of these ""timelocked"" transactions made between September 2019 and March 2020 were not accurately enforced by the network. This increases the risk of a hypothetical form of attack in which miners could essentially steal bitcoin from other miners. The bug affects 10% of timelocked transactions, or 2% of bitcoin transactions overall.      The findings highlight a key area of bitcoin research that aims to stop miners from growing too powerful or cheating in various ways so the world’s largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization worth around $173 billion, works as designed. 0xb10c is one of a global network of developers and researchers battle-testing the network, to guard against even theoretical attacks that so far haven't been much of an issue.      A timelocked transaction prevents the recipient of bitcoin from accessing it right away. Instead, the person must wait until the network has added a certain number of blocks to the ledger. Since each new block takes about 10 minutes to record, a timelock can be programmed to expire at an approximate point in the future by setting a corresponding block height.      Read more: Crypto Researcher Hasu Flags Attack That Could Bring ‘Purge’-Style Mayhem to Bitcoin      One use case for this feature is as a form of vesting – startup Blockstream has paid employees in timelocked bitcoin, for instance, which theoretically gives them an incentive to do what’s best for the network’s long-term value.      But the faulty timelocks 0xb10c detected had a more immediate purpose. Set for the current block (so they are not valid until one block later) they are designed to make ""a potentially disruptive mining strategy, called fee-sniping, less profitable,"" 0xb10c said.      With fee-sniping, a malicious miner tries to replace a block someone else just mined with their own, including the same transactions plus potentially other transactions that are still pending. The timelock prevents them from including the latter, limiting the spoils from the attack so it’s not worth the bother.    A long-term risk    The likelihood of such an attack might increase as transaction fees, which users pay to prioritize their payments, become a more important source of income for miners. Right now, miners mostly rely on block rewards of newly minted bitcoin to cover their costs. But this revenue stream decreases over time, as the Bitcoin network’s recent halving shows.      ""Currently, not enforcing a timelock to an absolute block height does not have consequences for the majority of transactions. In a few years, when the block reward consists mainly of transaction fees, it might make fee-sniping more profitable,"" 0xb10c told CoinDesk.      Hence, the bug could be harmful to the wider network. But right now, it's most likely a ""low-priority"" problem to fix for most wallet services because it doesn't result in users losing money or affect timelocks set further into the future, 0xb10c said.      Read more: BitMEX Is Making Bitcoin Network More Expensive for Everyone, Researcher Finds      Plus, the bug is a privacy leak for users. The oddly formed timelock is different from all the other timelocks on the network, so it's easy for blockchain voyeurs to see that the transaction is coming from a particular wallet.      Many of the faulty transactions 0xb10c detected were made by a single large entity, which he did not name. The engineer said he reached out to the entity producing the buggy software, who responded ""professionally,"" he said, coming up with a solution to the problem. It might take time for the solution to roll out, however.      ""A fix for this has been released in early 2020. However, it will take a while before all instances of the currently deployed software are upgraded,"" hesaid.      0xb10c hopes his research will raise awareness of the risk of fee-sniping attacks so wallets that haven't set the time locked transactions correctly can make the fix, making the Bitcoin network a little more robust.      He was able to pinpoint and contact the largest entity producing these flubbed transactions, but there are others out there making the same mistake.      ""It's hard to find the respective implementations creating these transactions,"" 0xb10c said. ""Some of them might not be open source, making it even harder.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX | RESEARCH,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/01/bug-in-timelocked-bitcoin-contracts-could-spur-miners-to-steal-from-each-other,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/099d1dad030d40c5ed8c4a37e6a8ce90c50f1fc4-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431984,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8gPh,1590970865,Crypto Long & Short: The Emergence of Prime Brokers Adds Resilience but Also Risk,"There are many types of hockey-stick evolutions in new industries. Startups dream of the lying-on-its-back L shape for their sales growth. Entrepreneurs chase the “escape velocity” funding momentum. And a subsector can simmer along with a low hum of activity until boom, years of progress and feverish months of under-the-surface connecting explode in a series of announcements and launches that signal a new phase of development.      Ok, maybe hockey sticks are not the best metaphor as they are made of a solid piece of something (you’ll notice I don’t know much about hockey). And the crypto markets are far from a solid anything, with disjointed parts, confusing rules and fragmented information. But moving pieces can eventually come together.      You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.      I’m talking about the emergence of prime brokers for crypto markets. Over the past few days several “blue chip” names (by crypto market standards) have revealed plans to knit new connective systems for crypto trading and investment, with the experience and the backing to make a meaningful difference.      This week crypto exchange Coinbase announced the acquisition of crypto prime broker Tagomi in an all-share deal that boosts the exchange’s institutional offering and gives Tagomi access to a strong balance sheet.      BitGo, one of the sector’s largest custodians, launched its prime broker services, adding lending and software to its existing suite of services.      And last week, Genesis Capital* revealed the acquisition of crypto custodian Vo1t, which will enable it to add custody to its institutional lending and trading.    Why now?    Several startups have been offering what they call “prime brokerage” services for institutional crypto investors, focusing on efficient order routing, but they generally lack the balance sheets and industry weight to be able to offer the crucial prime functions of lending, clearing and custody.      This lack of full service has been a barrier to institutional involvement in the industry.      The crypto market is different from traditional markets in that its exchanges operate as siloed units, each with different order books, prices and onboarding requirements. Investors need to set up and fund accounts at each platform on which they want to operate, which is a cumbersome use of time and an inefficient use of capital. It also precludes “best price” execution as, even if a certain exchange offers a better price at a given moment, investors may not be able to trade on that exchange in time to take advantage of it.      Prime brokers that reroute orders can solve part of the fragmentation of crypto markets by giving investors access to several exchanges via one account. But institutional investors also expect greater capital efficiency through leverage, netted collateral, convenient custody and seamless access to a broad range of products.    Bigger is better?    Coinbase, BitGo and Genesis are three of the more well-known institutional names in crypto markets, with strong revenues, growth trajectories, balance sheets and networks. All have been in acquisition mode recently, strengthening teams and service offerings. And all have strong backers.      This is significant, because any investor who lived through the painful fall of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers will stay well away from a prime broker that carries even the slightest risk of insolvency.      It is also significant because only well-backed and strongly solvent companies can afford to offer lending along with routing and custody, without adding undue risk to the balance sheet. This service will unlock a significant capital inefficiency barrier, and perhaps encourage participation from a wider range of institutional investors.      Unfortunately, the limited range of infrastructure firms that can offer the full prime brokerage suite of services means we are likely to see growing concentration in this field. This introduces new risks to the sector.      One is the strong degree of centralization in a sector built on the premise of decentralization and resilience. By replicating market structures from traditional finance, we are introducing some of its weaknesses and vulnerabilities, such as concentration of power (with the possibility of censorship), dependence on a handful of suppliers (in which one firm’s crisis could ripple through the whole market) and the additional layers of cost.      On the other hand, asking “mainstream” institutional money to get its collective head around an entirely new type of asset and market structure is probably a non-starter, especially when the new technologies aim to disrupt the way of life on which institutional money depends. A familiar investment process will smooth the entrance for many.      Another risk is conflicts of interest. Will clients trust the Coinbase/Tagomi prime broker to route orders to the best price available, even if it’s not on Coinbase? Could competing exchanges be shut out in favor of Coinbase and allies? In traditional finance, the largest prime brokers (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc.) are also among the largest broker/dealers. But they operate in much more regulated sectors, where “best price” is a legal obligation for many orders. This is not the case in crypto markets.      Rehypothecation could also start to rear its alarming head. One reliable source of income for traditional prime brokers is the lending out of clients’ collateral and assets in custody. This way, capital use becomes even more efficient, but the crypto collateral could end up in a convoluted web of ownership, undermining the very meaning of bearer assets and introducing a long trail of potentially incendiary flare-ups should anything go wrong with the original custodian or any of its clients.    What’s next?    While the new entrants to the crypto prime broker space will galvanize the sector as a whole in terms of a greater degree of professionalization of market infrastructure, which in turn is likely to attract a new type of market participant, the sector is still new and niche. Coinbase, BitGo and Genesis are big, but they’re not Goldman Sachs. They may be “blue chip” names to those of us in the sector, but the larger institutions will probably not have heard of them.      The large, conservative institutions could decide to wait until their long-standing prime brokers start to offer crypto services. That will be the bigger game-changer.      (*Genesis Capital is owned by DCG, also CoinDesk's parent.)    Goldman astonishes    Speaking of Goldman Sachs, it hosted a virtual presentation this week titled: “US Economic Outlook & Implications of Current Policies for Inflation, Gold and Bitcoin.”      I didn’t sit in on the call, so this is mainly based on the slide deck. For the economic forecast section, they wheeled out the big guns. Jason Furman has an arm’s-length curriculum of top economic posts, including professor of economic policy at Harvard and adviser to President Obama. He gave an interview on NPR earlier this week insisting that we were not looking at an economic depression, more like a recession, with the following insight: “A very bad recession is a problem. I think we should be doing everything we can to avoid it.”      The other author, Jan Hatzius, is also no economic slouch – as well as chief economist for Goldman Sachs, he is the holder of several forecasting awards. He apparently shares Furman’s relatively rosy outlook on the economy (and remember, he’s a good forecaster), saying on CNBC earlier this month that the jobs slump has not been as bad as he feared and that he expects most of the unemployed to be redeployed.      Their presentation forecasts GDP growth in 2021 of over 6%, with muted inflation. Yay.      All this must come as a huge relief to Goldman clients, to hear from two experts that things will be back to normal soon, so there’s no real need to change investment strategies.      These renowned economists did not write the asset-focused part of the presentation – that was done by the Investment Strategy Group (ISG) within the Consumer and Investment Management Division at Goldman Sachs. A footer in the presentation notes that the ISG is not part of Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research nor Goldman Sachs Global Markets Division, and its views may differ. So, this isn’t a case of Goldman flip-flopping on its previous interest in bitcoin. It’s a case of differing views within the organization. Fair enough.      The team concluded that neither gold nor bitcoin are good investments. Gold has underperformed both equities and bonds for extended periods of recent history. And bitcoin is not an asset class because it has no cash flow, earnings or portfolio hedge properties. And, this may come as a surprise to you: “a security whose appreciation is primarily dependent on whether someone else is willing to pay a higher price for it is not a suitable investment for our clients.” (My emphasis.) As Jill Carlson pointed out in her brilliant takedown of the report, “the fact someone else is willing to pay a higher price for a given instrument is probably the only criteria necessary to know something is a suitable investment.”      The revealing explanation for the team’s stance on bitcoin lies in the last three words of the report’s previously mentioned conclusion: “for our clients.”      This says so much more about the team’s clients than it does about bitcoin. The division manages private and corporate money, and I imagine you don’t park your wealth at Goldman for it to undertake risky plays. You park it there to have your hand held. Goldman’s ISG clients obviously want to know that their blue-chip investments are safe, that no pesky depressions are going to get in the way and no irksome threats from edgy assets will disrupt their comfortable portfolio structures, which no doubt include a hefty dose of bond, equity and real estate funds that provide nice management fees to the firm.      I’ll do you the favor of skipping a critique of the other five slides, with their escalating inanity. I will say that I’ve seen deeper insight on Fox News.      Let’s take a moment to appreciate, however, that they’re talking about bitcoin at all. We can conclude that their clients have been asking.      We’ve seen this before, in the blind eye to growing risk in the financial system back in 2007-8, in the “it’s just the flu” chant of early 2020, and now in the “everything will be fine” mantra of private money managers. We’ve seen before how a lack of interest in real downside leaves portfolios vulnerable. We’ve seen before how top-level experts are usually reluctant to shake the tree that gives them fruit, and we all know that telling clients things they don’t want to hear is not always a good business strategy for money managers.      We also know that good money managers aren’t afraid to do so. Good money managers look at the whole spectrum of risk, not just the middle part. Good money managers don’t wear rose-tinted glasses with blinkers. And good money managers actually research an asset before giving a presentation on it.    Anyone know what's going on yet?        The re-opening of the NYSE infused the markets with a sense of optimism that even the crescendo of trade tensions and the escalation of social unrest could not dent, and the S&P continued its upward trend.      The “back to work” narrative will have pushback, however, from the “new cold war” narrative emerging as I type, and from the relative absence of consumer demand – U.S. consumer spending plunged 13.6% in April, more than expected and almost double March’s slump.      It’s interesting to note that the Nasdaq underperformed the S&P 500 for the first time in weeks – its habitual outperformance that you can see in the YTD figures imply that the market rally has been concentrated in tech stocks. It seems that buying interest is now spreading to other sectors such as cyclicals and small-caps.      Bitcoin reversed a couple of weeks of declines, although the price ranged 10% from its weekly low to its weekly high, so timing is everything. Corporate developments lent a constructive tone to the narrative, overriding any disappointment from the cursory treatment from Goldman Sachs’ private investment team (see above).      This brings up an interesting question: what is the prevailing narrative now that the halving is over? I think it’s the big steps forward in market infrastructure development as big prime brokers muscle in to entice institutional money. Yes, we’ve heard that mantra before – but this time, the infrastructure is getting in position. This may not be enough to make a meaningful difference in volume just yet. But it is a step towards standardization of the bitcoin market, which could enhance liquidity and lower volatility.      (Note: Nothing in this newsletter is investment advice. The author owns small amounts of bitcoin and ether.)    CHAIN LINKS      Crypto data provider Kaiko ran some numbers on bitcoin’s volatility compared to that of equities, gold and the U.S. dollar, and showed that the ratio between BTC and S&P 500 volatilities is increasing but still notably lower than in January. TAKEAWAY: This is not surprising given the general market turmoil at the end of Q1, where the volatilities of both shot up. Since then, however, the S&P 500 volatility has been settling down while BTC volatility has jumped in the month of May.      Bitcoin held on crypto exchanges hit an 18-month low, down 11% so far this year, while the amount of ether held on the same exchanges has increased by 7% over the same period. Glassnode showed, however, that bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges are not evenly distributed, with some balances remaining consistent or even increasing, while others such as those on Bitfinex have dropped over 60%. TAKEAWAY: So the conclusion that “people are holding more than before” does not hold up under closer scrutiny. The theory is that, if investors want to hold on to their bitcoin for a while, they remove them from exchanges to custody them in more secure solutions. Thus, declining exchange balances is a bullish signal. But if that trend is concentrated on just a handful of exchanges, then there could be something else going on.      Last week I pointed out that bitcoin transaction fees were rising sharply. Well, now they’re falling, but are still well above pre-halving levels. TAKEAWAY: This could be a consequence of last week’s mining difficulty decrease, which should entice more miners back into production as it becomes more profitable. This marginally reduces the interval between blocks, which could ease pressure on fees.      Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder Ventures, reminded us that, in the past, the CNY/USD exchange rate and the bitcoin price have been correlated. TAKEAWAY: That doesn’t mean they will be again, but the relationship could be worth watching, especially as trade tensions and geopolitical posturing continue to play out in the currency markets. The theory is that a depreciating yuan will send savers into bitcoin as a currency hedge.      Crypto derivatives platform ErisX has launched an API for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin block trading. TAKEAWAY: As well as facilitating liquidity in cryptocurrencies with smaller tokens (where large orders could move the price), this is yet another signpost in the evolving professionalization of the sector.      Digital asset manager CoinShares has launched the CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index (CGCI), the first EU Benchmark Regulations-compliant index that combines digital assets and gold. TAKEAWAY: This brings bitcoin and traditional assets such as gold even closer together in the minds of portfolio managers by combining them into one index, designed to play on the relative lack of correlation between the two. The firm is looking into deploying the index as an investable benchmark, providing yet another example of how crypto assets are giving rise to innovative investment vehicles.      An attempt to help blockchain companies based in Switzerland’s Crypto Valley via loans backed by a sovereign wealth fund has been blocked by the Swiss government. TAKEAWAY: Times sure have changed when what used to be a center for initial coin offerings is now relying on government bailouts for funding.
