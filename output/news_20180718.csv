42401645,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd1yRO,1531951544,Bitcoin Trading Volume Is Up 100% From Its Recent Low,"With Tuesday's dramatic $600 bitcoin rally came a sharp rise in trading volume, more specifically a 100 percent increase from its 7-month volume low set just four days ago.  As of Monday, bitcoin's 24-hour trading volume had fallen to $2.92 billion, a level last seen on November 7. However, as price volatility tends to follow dramatic volume lows, bitcoin's breakout yesterday was no exception to the rule: 24-hour trading volume reached $5.9 billion.  All in all, this marked a 103.7 percent increase from the 36-week low set this past Saturday.  On some exchanges, volumes even set records.  A popular high-leverage trading cryptocurrency exchange, Bitmex, experienced its highest bitcoin trading volume in an 8-hour window ever during the price surge yesterday. As seen in the chart below, the value recorded was north of $2.4 billion.  Further, this week's bitcoin trading volume is already well on its way to surpassing that of the prior week.  Since Monday, the cryptocurrency's trading volume is already above 115,000 BTC units, surpassing 90 percent of the total volume recorded in the prior full week, according to data from the Bitfinex exchange.  Breaking the long-term trend of declining volume could prove crucial for the bitcoin bulls if they wish to regain long term composure, and this week's action is a step in the right direction.

42401631,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd1yEb,1531949739,US Congressman Calls for Ban on Crypto Buying and Mining,"A U.S. lawmaker has called for a blanket ban on cryptocurrency buying.  Congressman Brad Sherman is no stranger to controversial statements on the subject – back in March he called cryptocurrencies ""a crock"" – and during the Wednesday hearing of a subcommittee for the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, he went so far as to advocate keeping Americans out of the market entirely.  ""We should prohibit U.S. persons from buying or mining cryptocurrencies,"" the California Democrat - whose largest donor is credit card processor Allied Wallet - declared. He added that, beyond cryptocurrencies being potentially used as a form of money in the future, it can currently be used by tax evaders and rogue states seeking to bypass U.S. sanctions.  One of the panelists, Norbert Michel, director for the Center for Data Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, pushed back against the idea that criminal use should define cryptocurrencies as a whole.  Michel told the subcommittee:  ""Yes it is true that criminals have used bitcoin, but it's also true that criminals have used airplanes, computers and automobiles. We shouldn't criminalize any of those instruments simply because criminals used them.""  ""Those components I believe are the main barriers to widespread adoption in the U.S,"" he added.  No love for CBDCs  Though much of the hearing revolved around general monetary policy and history, the crypto-specific portions revealed a general opposition to the idea of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  To quickly recap: a number of central banks around the world have been investigating the idea of using some of the technology concepts behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as part of new, wholly digital money systems. The idea is that the tech can boost transparency and efficiency.  But some of those looking into the subject have warned that it could amplify the risk of bank runs, and several institutions have sworn off the idea entirely following their research.  Alex Pollock, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, blasted the concept during Wednesday's hearing, declaring it ""a terrible idea - one of the worst financial ideas of recent times.""  Other committee members couldn't help but agree that the idea, at the very least, raised more fundamental questions about how blockchain and cryptocurrencies actually work.  Congressman Bill Foster asked about blockchain immutability, saying ""the promise of blockchain is a non-falsifiable ledger … [what] remains an unsolved problem in the digital world is how do you authenticate yourself?""  Payments boon  On a more positive note, Dr. Eswar Prasad, senior professor of Trade Policy at Cornell University, argued that the existence of cryptocurrencies had the potential to impact the financial services system, particularly the payments system, in positive ways.  According to Prasad, cryptocurrencies could ""make transactions much easier ... and bring down the cost,"" but the benefits are limited at the moment.  Michel himself noted:  ""It is certainly difficult to imagine a cryptocurrency replacing the U.S. dollar as long as the Federal Reserve acts as a moderately good steward of the national currency, but it is for this very reason that Congress should eliminate barriers that impede people from using their preferred medium of exchange.""  Ultimately, the hearing was cut short in order to make way for a House vote.  However, just prior to dispersing the attendees, chairman Andy Barr noted that cryptocurrencies will ""continue to have a greater and greater impact on our financial system,"" making it a topic the committee would likely have to ""revisit"" once again.

Speaking to the House Financial Services Committee, the head of U.S. central bank said Wednesday that cryptocurrencies have no ""intrinsic value"" and presented severe risks to investors, as CNBC reported. Part of his concerns seemingly stem from the apparent crypto bubble - he said that ""relatively unsophisticated investors see the asset go up in price, and they think 'this is great, I'll buy this.' In fact, there is no promise of that.""  He added:  ""It's not really a currency. We're not looking at this as something that we should be doing ... Mainly I have concerns. If you think about what currencies do, they're supposed to be a means of payment and a store of value basically and cryptocurrencies are not used very much in payment ... and in terms of the store of value, if you look at the volatility it's just not there.""  ""They are very challenging because cryptocurrencies are great if you're trying to hide or launder money, we have to be very conscious of that,"" he said.  That being said, though ""there are investor and consumer protection issues,"" Powell said the cryptocurrency market isn't big enough to threaten financial stability, and therefore the Fed isn't seeking to regulate it, according to Bloomberg.  Powell's testimony comes hours before the Financial Services Committee is set to host another hearing directly focused on cryptocurrencies. As previously reported by CoinDesk, the committee hearing will hone in on the question of whether cryptocurrencies are a new form of money.

Indeed, while some may seek the immediate establishment of bright lines, the reality is that hasty regulatory pronouncements are likely to miss the mark, have unintended consequences, or fail to capture important nuance regarding the structure of new products or models.""  Gorfine would return to that point several times during the hearing, which began at 10 a.m. local time.  ""It's important that we're not hasty in figuring out what the contours are of applying securities law and then the commodities framework,"" he remarked.  Congressional sentiment  The hearing  notably provided a window into what some members of Congress think when it comes to the subject of cryptocurrencies – though it wasn't positive in some cases.  For example, Rep. Collin Peterson remarked that, in his view, much of the cryptocurrency ecosystem ""seems like a Ponzi scheme,"" asking ""what's behind this?""  It was Gensler who offered a response, stating that ""there's really nothing behind gold either ... what's behind it is a cultural norm, for thousands of years we liked gold.""  ""We do it as a store of value, so bitcoin is a modern form of digital gold. It's a social construct,"" he continued.  In other cases, committee members simply wanted more information on how cryptocurrencies exactly work.  ""We're creating another money supply here as I see it. I just don't know how that works. Our dollar sets the mark for the world. I can't visualize how this would work,"" Rep. Rick Allen commented.  But it was Michael Conaway, the chairman of the committee, who perhaps had one of the most notable – and telling – remarks about bitcoin, coming at the very end of the hearing and just days after the U.S. Justice Department claimed it had traced bitcoin transactions conducted by 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacks during the 2016 presidential election.  ""As long as the stupid criminals keep using bitcoin, it'll be great,"" Conaway quipped.  Want to read CoinDesk's full by-the-second coverage of the hearing? Follow our stream on Twitter here.

42401629,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd1yCd,1531930512,"Mining Malware Now a Bigger Threat Than Ransomware, Says Report","Illicit cryptocurrency mining, or ""cryptojacking,"" has become more popular among cybercriminals than ransomware, according to a report by Skybox Security.  In its mid-year update, the firm said that crypto miners now account for 32 percent of all cyberattacks, while ransomware only makes up 8 percent.  Cryptojacking utilizes code hidden on websites or devices to harnesses victims' computing resources such as their central processing unit and bandwidth to mine cryptocurrencies.  The Skybox report reveals a notable shift in the preferences of cyberattackers when it comes to choosing the tools of their illegal trade.  In the second half of 2017, Skybox found that the situation was almost exactly reversed. While ransomware attacks – in which the data on an individual's computer is encrypted by malware and only unlocked upon payment of a fee – made up 32 percent of all attacks, cryptojacking represented 7 percent of the total at the time.  While the reason for the swap in popularity may be partly down to the rise in price of cryptocurrencies at the end of last year, Skybox said the ransomware model was seeing diminishing returns as victims stopped paying up on reports that data was not being decrypted as promised. Increasing adoption of user protections, such as data backups and better protective tools, were also cited as a factor.  In the update, which was first reported by Computing, the company said:  ""Cryptocurrency miners may be the new kid on the block, but they're taking over. With high-profit opportunity and a low chance of being discovered or stopped, this malware tool provides a money-making safe haven for cybercriminals.""

In effect, the changes mean that Parity's ""wallet"" – that is, its repository of private keys – does not now exist for general, non-technical consumers. All ""installers and operating-system specific packages"" have also been removed.  According to newly published details for the Parity 2.0 client, the software is being positioned as ""expert software for production use and shouldn't be considered end-user software or an 'Ethereum Wallet'.""  At the heart of the change is a repositioning of sorts away from serving as a tool for everyday users, placing the emphasis on those that provide infrastructure on the ethereum network, primarily exchanges and miners.  As the post explains  :  ""We reflect these strategic changes by completely removing the graphical user interface, the so-called 'Parity Wallet,' from the client. Furthermore, we have removed all installers and operating-system specific packages. In this way, we see Parity Ethereum as a piece of core infrastructure, to be bundled into end-user software packages such as graphical wallets or to be used as a library in mobile apps.""  The announcement comes nearly one year to the day that roughly $30 million in ether were stolen as a result of a vulnerability in the Parity software. The bug was related to a specific multi-signature contract, as CoinDesk reported at the time.  Another, more serious code flaw resulted in the freeze of more than 500,000 ETH – an amount worth more than $250 million at press time – last November. According to a post-mortem published afterward, the deletion of a code library that supports Parity's multi-signature wallet sparked the fund lock-up.  Changes aside, those hoping to continue using a Parity-derived wallet can do so, according to the post, though the startup said that it will ""only minimally maintain"" the user interface that is linked out to on GitHub.

The firm announced on Wednesday during a press conference in Beijing that the photo sharing platform – called Totem – is now live and features a dedicated token called Totem Point, according to a local news report. The launch marks the first blockchain application to be released on Baidu's private XuperChain network.  Baidu said it will initially generate 4 billion Totem tokens with an annual inflation rate of 4.5 percent to encourage individuals and institutions to submit original photographs.  According to a white paper also revealed today, the quantity of tokens awarded will depend on the validation process, including the quantity and quality of images submitted by a user.  Whether or not the Totem token can be traded for cash or other cryptocurrencies has not been disclosed as yet. Similarly, its full use case scenarios have not been spelled out, although Baidu did say that the token could ultimately be used across different applications built on top of the XuperChain network.  Baidu first announced the Totem initiative in April – without mentioning the token – describing it as a distributed platform that creates a traceable chain of tamper-proof data to protect photo sharers' intellectual property.  After platform users upload their original images through the application, the blockchain's participating nodes, such as invited third party photo stock agents and copyright protection organizations, will validate the originality of the images. If approved, the nodes timestamp the images' critical information and store it on Baidu's blockchain, producing verifiable data that could be vital in the event of a copyright dispute later on, the company said.  As a next step, Baidu aims to expand the blockchain rights protection system to include other types of digital media asset such as videos, an addition expected by the first quarter of next year.

Announced Wednesday, after a meeting of ministers from eight government agencies working on economic policy, tax rates are to be reduced for companies dealing with a range of 157 ""new-growth technologies"" in 11 areas, according to a report from CoinDesk Korea.  In addition, the ministers proposed to reduce the threshold for companies to be eligible for tax reduction benefits. Currently, in order to get tax deduction, a firm must allocate more than 5 percent of the previous year's gross sales to R&D and 10 percent of its R&D investment should focus on new growth technologies such as blockchain.  Since a lack or absence of sales in a startup's first year could make it difficult for it to apply for tax benefits, the ministers suggest the r&D investment requirement should be changed to more than 5 percent of the current year's gross sales.  However, the government has not disclosed how much the tax deduction might be, saying further details of the proposal will be announced on July 26, with the changes expected to take effect by the first quarter of 2019.  The meeting is the second in a week on the same topic, which was also discussed by ministers last Friday. An report from news agency Yonhap at the time indicated that the new tax rule would apply to any company based in South Korea that focuses on blockchain technology, whether they are foreign or domestic firms.

42401627,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd1yAf,1531915207,Bitcoin Exchange Paxful Reveals Plan to Reach Venezuela's Unbanked,"Peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange Paxful is doubling down on developing markets.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the startup plans to open an office in hyperinflation-ridden Venezuela in September and release an Android app, its first for mobile devices, in October.  According to Paxful co-founder Ray Youssef, the reason for both moves is that exchange use is surging in developing nations, where mobile phones are abundant and cheap but access to crypto remains scarce.  Youssef told CoinDesk:  ""Underbanked, unbanked or people in a desperate situation, such as with market inflation. Those are the markets where Paxful can add the most value and where bitcoin actually adds the most value for people.""  Africa (the continent with the highest rate of unbanked adults, according to a 2010 McKinsey study) is Paxful's biggest market, he said. According to Paxful's internal data, June saw 772,000 bitcoin trades averaging $64 each in Nigeria and 50,000 bitcoin trades in Ghana averaging $56 each.  All told, Paxful has 2 million users. The company, with 65 employees, collects a 1 percent fee from the seller on each trade.  Aside from Paxful and the similar P2P exchange LocalBitcoins, Binance, KuCoin and Luno are among the few exchanges serving users in cash-strapped economies like Nigeria and Ghana, where U.S. dollars and South African rand are harder to find, said South African entrepreneur Thabang Mashiloane.  ""Most African currencies are not [stable], there's a lot of volatility,"" Mashiloane, co-founder of the Johannesburg-based exchange Chankura, told CoinDesk. ""You can't do remittances in that way [with bitcoin] if Ghana doesn't have liquidity.""  In Venezuela, Paxful's new office will conduct market research focused on local users. Youssef thinks crypto could be both a more stable store of value and a more convenient medium of exchange there than what's available to residents right now.  ""If you just want to buy some eggs or groceries for your family in Venezuela you have to go through this very painful, long and drawn out process,"" he said. ""You can't use cash, because cash is scarce and if you're lucky enough to actually have cash you can get a 50 percent discount.""  To address such situations, Paxful's upcoming app in October will include in-app calculators for volatile currencies like the Venezuelan bolívar.  ""It would allow users and merchants to transact, for the local currency, but using purely cryptocurrency in the background,"" Youssef said. ""So people can use it on a daily basis.""  Checking ID at the door  Still, the demand for Paxful's services in these areas highlights the complexities of bitcoin usage in the developing world.  Communities where crypto represents a potential economic lifeline are often excluded from both traditional banking services and global exchange platforms. Exorbitant banking fees are one reason low-income users in Africa rarely use exchanges, as a bank wire is usually needed to get money to the exchange. Plus, many people in the developing world don't have government-issued IDs, which regulated financial providers, whether they're traditional banks or crypto exchanges, must check.  And Paxful itself hasn't been completely immune to these issues – starting in September, it will require IDs from buyers of bitcoin, a change Youssef said was necessary to fight fraud.  Up to now, Paxful required only the sellers of bitcoin to upload their IDs, because it didn't want to exclude potential buyers who were attracted to cryptocurrency for the same reasons they lacked access to banking.  ""For a long time most Paxful users were actually female,"" Youssef said, speaking to the segment of the developing world's population who, according to World Bank statistics, are most likely to lack IDs and bank accounts.  But not requiring ID from one side of the trade can lead to problems when business is conducted wholly online.  Most Paxful users swap bitcoin for fiat wire transfers or online gift cards. The model is similar to LocalBitcoins in that open offers to buy or sell bitcoin are posted and traders contact each other and swap directly. But while LocalBitcoins focuses on swaps between people in the same area (who often meet face-to-face), Paxful mainly deals in small online trades among users who are geographically spread out.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, in the three years since the Delaware-incorporated Paxful's founding, the startup attracted a number of scammers and struggled to weed them out manually.  Beyond traditional IDs, however, Paxful will also accept the Nigerian BVN Code (a form of biometric identification), fingerprint scanning, or verifications through other know-your-customer providers such as NetVerify, Jumio, Onfido, and Veriff. The next version of the web app, coming in September, will also use artificial intelligence to detect suspicious behavior.  ""Scams and frauds are the problem in peer-to-peer trading,"" Youssef said. ""We're redoing our entire KYC process.""

42401643,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd1yQP,1531911624,Bitcoin Price Risks Pullback Before Testing $8K Again,"Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a minor price pullback, having clocked a 39-day high above $7,500 earlier today.  The leading cryptocurrency rose to $7,562 on Bitfinex at 03:00 UTC and was last seen changing hands at $7,400 – up nearly 10 percent on a 24-hour basis. Further, the price rally has pushed the week-on-week gains higher to 15 percent.  On Tuesday, BTC crossed the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $6,838 with strength, confirming a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  So, a rally to $7,900 (inverse head-and-shoulders breakout target) could be on the cards. However, the move may not happen in the next 24 hours as the retreat from $7,562 to $7,370 indicates the bulls are keen on booking profits, having pushed BTC higher by more than $1,300 in the last 72 hours.  Further, the technical charts are also reporting intraday overbought conditions, meaning a price pullback could be in the offing before the rally continues. Moreover, investors who missed the initial move higher would have the opportunity to board the BTC freight train on any price pullback.  A minor correction, if it occurs, could end up recharging the engines for a sustained rally to $7,900–$8,000.  Daily chart        The above chart shows BTC has pulled back from near 100-day moving average (MA) hurdle of $7,613. Still, the bias remains bullish as the cryptocurrency has found acceptance above the 50-day MA.  The short-term moving averages (5-day, 10-day) are rising in favor of the bulls and the 5-day MA has cut the 50-day MA from below, confirming a bullish crossover.  What's more, the relative strength index (RSI) has also adopted a bullish bias (above 50.00).  As a result, BTC is more likely to extend the rally to $7,900–$8,000 in the short-run and confirm a successful reentry in the pennant pattern. That would be a major blow to BTC bears as the bearish pennant breakdown in June had signaled a revival of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December.  A move back inside the pennant pattern would signal a long-term bearish invalidation. Meanwhile, a break above the pennant resistance, currently seen at $8,210, would strengthen the odds of a long-run bullish reversal.  Hourly chart  The RSI is beginning to roll over from the overbought territory (above 80.00) and the price pullback will likely gather pace if RSI drops below support at 58.00. Hence, we are unable to rule out a drop in BTC prices to $7,000.  That said, the dip is expected to be short-lived as the 50-hour MA, 100-hour MA, and 200-hour MA is located one above the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside.  View  BTC price is seen rallying to $8,000 in the short-run, albeit after a healthy pullback to $7,000.  The technical correction will likely help BTC chart a more sustainable rally to $8,000.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $6,839 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) would abort the bullish view.  A close below $6,080 (July 12 low) would shift risk in favor of a drop to $5,755 (June 24 low).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42401640,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd1yNS,1531906233,Bitcoin Mining Firms Make Unicorn List for First Time,"Three bitcoin mining companies have joined a list of ""unicorns"" – private companies valued at over $1 billion – for the first time.  The Shanghai-based Hurun Research Institute published its Q2 Unicorn Index for the Greater China region on Wednesday, which notably included the names of several major bitcoin mining firms: Bitmain, Canaan Creative and Ebang. The third Hurun list of 130 Chinese unicorns has never before featured a fully cryptocurrency-focused firm.  Ranking highest of the three, Bitmain appears at 13th on the list with a valuation of around 70 billion yuan, or about $10.4 billion, close to other notable companies such as JD Logistics.  The ranking follows recent news indicating that Bitmain has completed a Series B round funding that could value the firm around $10 billion ahead of a potential initial public offering (IPO).  Meanwhile, Hurun values Canaan and Ebang at around $3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively – figures that saw the firms placed at at 32nd and 53rd on the list, also respectively.  Recent reports have indicated that Canaan and Ebang too have both filed applications to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. However, since the IPO applications were in initial draft form, it is unclear how much the two were seeking to raise or what their valuations might be. According to a previous report from Reuters, in mid-2017, Canaan was estimated to be worth around $500 million.  While the three are the first fully devoted bitcoin firms to appear on the Greater China Unicorn Index, some of the companies already on the list have already made major moves in the blockchain industry.  For instance, Ant Financial – a payment affiliate of Alibaba that tops the list with a valuation of $149 billion – announced late last month that it has launched a blockchain-powered payment corridor between Hong Kong and the Philippines.  Further, OneConnect – a fintech development arm of Chinese insurance giant PingAn and valued at $7.4 billion – has helped the Hong Kong Monetary Authority engineer a blockchain trade finance platform that is set to go live by September.

42401626,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd1yBe,1531900843,Fiat Currencies Are About to Become Essential to Public Blockchains,"Paul Brody is a principal and the global blockchain leader at EY.  The following article is the third in a series. Read part one here and part two here.      Cryptocurrenices ask you to put your trust in math and not in fallible central bankers, but they come with a lot of political baggage of their own.  In particular, cryptocurrency boosters talk a lot about how central bankers have debased currencies over the years and how the printing of money by central banks has done much to impoverish people around the world. In an imagined future world of cryptocurrencies, fallible and politically influenced central bankers are replaced with algorithms and currencies get more valuable over time, not less so.  There are a lot of problems with this narrative, starting with the fact that a little bit of inflation is actually useful and the painful era of stagflation is more than 30 years in the rear-view mirror. Independent central banks are among the most trusted institutions in our economies, and also the most transparent. And while the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies seems large by absolute standards, it's tiny compared to the rest of the global economy. Daily trading of cryptocurrencies is between $5 billion and $6 billion right now. Daily trading on the foreign exchange markets is closer to $5 trillion.  Even if cryptocurrencies continue to grow (and they most likely will), if we want blockchains to deliver upon their promise, we must be able to transact using traditional fiat currencies. There are lots of practical reasons for this, the most important of which is the management of risk for enterprises.  Nearly all business transactions today are done in traditional fiat currencies. Traditional enterprises generate most of their revenue in those currencies and they also handle all their debts and payments in the same currencies.  In order for firms to transact on the blockchain, they will want to transact in those same currencies. If I have a deal to buy a product at a set price in euros, and I execute that contract on a public blockchain, then I also want to settle it in euros, most likely. Every time I move money between currencies or hold substantial amounts of a different currency, I'm adding foreign exchange risk to my business, which serves no purpose if it can be avoided.  One option for companies engaging in smart contracts on blockchains is to arrange payment settlement through the banking system separately and simply record that payment on the blockchain. This option works, but we believe it is a less-than-ideal solution when you start to consider the broader economic ecosystem that you are enabling on a blockchain.  All in one  The best option for companies entering into business contracts on a blockchain is to complete the full exchange of asset tokens within the same blockchain. Asset tokens (representing product) are exchanged for money tokens in the simplest format, but with all the tokens being represented in the same blockchain, more sophisticated options are possible. Companies can borrow against inventory, with loans repaid automatically upon the sale of the inventory, for example.  At EY, we've taken to calling this a ""full cycle economic contract"" as the gold standard for what enterprises will want to achieve using blockchains for commerce. Full-cycle digital contracts will not only be lower risk, since both assets and liabilities will be transparently managed on the blockchain, but almost any kind of financial service can be delivered against those flows with minimal cost for the transactions.  Ultimately, this means billions of dollars in tokenized fiat currencies must be available on the public blockchains to facilitate these transactions and payments. If this path does come to pass, however, it means that central banks will have to find a regulatory structure or approach that allows for multiple currencies and tokens to co-exist on public blockchains – networks they do not regulate or fully control. It also means that private central-banking blockchains are not necessarily likely to have a big role ahead.  We believe, however, that there are mechanisms for regulators to control their own currencies in decentralized public networks, and I will dive into that and more in my next post.

The company said on Wednesday that major investors in the round included token-focused hedge fund Polychain and venture capital firm Sequoia China, as well as several China-based blockchain startups like wallet services Bixin and imToken.  The new financing will be put to use expanding Nervos' product and engineering team with the aim of speeding up the development of its own enterprise blockchain infrastructure, the firm said.  Co-founded by Jan Xie, a former ethereum foundation developer who authored the Ruby implementation, the startup aims to create its own public blockchain network, also called Nervos.  Taking a hybrid approach that combines a public blockchain with another layer of what it calls an ""application chain,"" Nervos claims the system will resolve the common blockchain issues of scalability and security simultaneously.  The approach is meant to allow companies to develop decentralized applications on top of a secure public network, but run them in the application chain layer – removing the need for enterprises to commit ""their entire tech stack to the blockchain.""  Xie said in the announcement:  ""While there are undeniable benefits for enterprises that utilize blockchain technology to innovate and improve existing systems, enterprise adoption has been held back by a host of challenges like scalability, security, and complexity.""  The new funding also marks the latest investment move by Sequoia China in the blockchain industry, following recent reports of the venture capital firm's participation in bitcoin mining giant Bitmain's Series B round funding.  Earlier this year, Polychain also invested in a Swiss blockchain startup's $61 million funding round with venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. DFINITY Stiftung said the funding would go toward development of its protocol, aimed to support a public decentralized cloud computing platform.

42401636,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd1yHY,1531886420,Democracy of Two: NEO and the Crypto 'Election' That Wasn't,"What constitutes an election?  According those backing ethereum competitor neo, just one candidate and two voters.  The public blockchain project, whose tokens are valued at over $2 billion by crypto investors, went so far as to claim in a July 4 blog post that it had entered a ""new era"" in which its token holders will have a say in how decisions on the network are made, but even insiders are skeptical such assertions are little more than rhetoric.  Case in point, the NEO Foundation, which develops software for neo, announced this month that it had elected the first node to its network, a foundation-funded collective of NEO developers calling themselves City of Zion. Less publicized at the time, however, was that token holders were not allowed to participate in that vote.  As such, even those running the newly elected node aren't exactly convinced that neo is fully committed to running its blockchain with broad participation from users, at least at this time.  ""I would personally disagree with calling it an election,"" Ethan Fast, a member of the City of Zion team, told CoinDesk in an interview. ""That's not a word I would choose.""  More broadly, such a conclusion is instructive in that neo is one of a growing number of public blockchains seeking to implement a more centralized model for how blockchains can be managed. Called delegated byzantine fault tolerance (dBFT), neo's specific idea is that by consolidating decision-making to a small group of nodes, the software can become faster and more useful.  Its a break from bitcoin's mining model in which any node operator who abides by the rules can compete to approve transactions, and one that has seen a handful of projects including EOS and Tron raise billions with big promises that it can prove viable.  In this way, neo, which has close ties to blockchain solutions company Onchain and the public Ontology project, has adopted technology it believes will address scalability issues — specifically, slow transaction speeds and controversial network upgrades.  ""[The] NEO Council values efficiency (quick response and protocol upgrade) over decentralization (sometimes a crypto-political correctness) at this early stage,"" the project's governing body, now called the NEO Foundation, explained in a May post.  However, neo is perhaps unique in that it hasn't provided much in the way of details on how it aims to do this in a way that will add up to the democratic process its touts.  Neo's white paper and website do not provide a detailed description of its governance model, and further, the foundation has said in blog posts that it plans to maintain ""decision-making power"" until the ""core protocol stabilizes,"" though it has not defined what criteria constitute stability.  Once the foundation is confident in the strength of the network, it says it ""expect[s] to see one to a few dozens of consensus nodes to be elected by NEO holders."" But before token holders are able to vote for candidates, the foundation plans to ""elect"" several private nodes, of which City of Zion is one.  A 'benevolent oligarchy'  That might be one reason why other supporting language issued by the foundation has positioned the election as the first step in a long process to relinquish some of its power to token holders.  Still, the NEO Foundation's use of the term ""election"" to describe the process by which City of Zion became a node at all has triggered some skepticism.  While ""election"" would arguably imply that a multiplicity of votes were cast, blog posts suggest that the NEO Foundation is currently the only voting entity in the ecosystem. City of Zion's Fast confirmed that ""there was no one from the public that voted in this election besides the NEO Foundation."" Likewise, of the foundation, only project co-founders Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang have the authority to make decisions, according to another blog post.  As such, Fast instead described NEO as ""a kind of benevolent oligarchy,"" and said that the community has been frustrated that the foundation has been slow to surrender some of its decision-making power.  ""Just a small amount of decentralization in the short term is something CoZ has been pushing for for some time,"" he said, adding that it ""may not be happening as fast as [the community] want[s].""  Dean Eigenmann, founder of blockchain governance startup Harbour, was more critical of the foundation's ""election.""  ""Libya had elections under Gaddafi, too,"" he said, explaining further of the project:  ""It just seems so uninteresting because it's like they aren't even trying to decentralize their governance. They were like, hmm this seems too hard. Let's just keep it centralized.""  Degrees of democracy  NEO is not the only project to be criticized for how it is going about the election of nodes.  Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin warned in March that blockchains that use ""coin voting"" seem ""to lead to a high risk of economic or political failure of some kind."" Likewise, Kyle Samani, managing partner at crypto fund Multicoin Capital, wrote on Twitter in June that EOS and Tezos, two other project seeking to compete on governance, are both ""plutocracies.""  However, Richard Lee, founding partner at crypto fund Global Blockchain Innovative Capital took a more flexible position in an interview with CoinDesk, arguing that ""there's different levels of decentralization.""  ""I think the different consensus protocols, at least right now, there's trade offs in between. Sometimes you have to sacrifice decentralization for speed and efficiency or security,"" he said, adding:  ""Neo's trying to address scalability in a different way than ethereum is... Neo has a more centralized approach for that.""  Lee said he interpreted the foundation's use of ""election,"" ""as more of, the NEO Foundation does not run all the nodes now,"" and added, ""I don't see anything malicious or deceitful about that.""  Some participants in neo community forums were nonetheless skeptical of the election, with one reddit user posting, ""Decentralization goes way beyond the amount of nodes. It has to do with governance and decision making. If you still have a central entity deciding new features, etc you cannot become fully decentralized.""  However, other comments reflected Lee's conclusion about the election, with many participants greeting the announcement of the election with enthusiasm.  Whether neo will follow through on its promise to empower token holders remains to be seen.  According to a timeline published in a blog post, the foundation plans to elect Dutch telecommunications company and neo partner KPN and Chinese venture capital firm Fenbushi Capital to operate the next privately held nodes in the network by the end of 2018. It intends to allow token holders to both vote for and campaign to become nodes in 2019.  The NEO Foundation did not respond to requests for comment.

42401647,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd1ySN,1531882560,3 Signs Bitcoin's Move Above $7K Might Just Hold,"The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization exploded in price Tuesday, jumping $600 in 30 minutes to break away from what had been suppressive bear market conditions.  But entering Wednesday, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,370 and showing signs it might continue its ascent. In fact, when viewed on longer timeframes, it appears that the trend is changing, this time in favor of the always-optimistic bulls.  But just how reliable is this move?  So far, there are three general tools traders are using to analyze the markets in a quest to confirm that the change in trend will have staying power.  Tool #1: 55 EMA surpassed  Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) act like signals that provide crucial insights into the asking bid as well as the momentum behind each major move.  As such, they can be used to confirm or deny a trend change by analyzing the position of the EMA in relation to the current price. The longer the EMA, the more significant the move is as it has more data points to collect from and a greater range of price history.  Stepping back, the number 55 is a Fibonacci number that technical traders use in relation to other Fibonacci sequences including 8,11 and 21 (usually skipping 34). It can provide crucial information about the current health of a particular stock or asset, and works best when viewed from longer time-frames.  For example, from May 11 to July 16, the 55 EMA for bitcoin was above the price acting as a barrier or resistance to any major moves past $6,860 (see positioning of red EMA).  Until yesterday, the position of the exponential moving average remained unchallenged, solidifying the bearish perspective over a two-month period.  However, the recent bitcoin surge forced the EMA below the current price, confirming that the breakout is both significant and bullish in the mid-term.  Tool #2: Fibonacci extensions and retracements  Extensions and retracements are used to predict the levels of resistance and support for an underlying stock or asset. (You can use the Fibonacci tool to identify where the most likely region of major resistance or support lies).  To draw an extension for bitcoin, take the cursor to the bottom of the previous significant low (June 26) and draw it up toward the significant two month high seen May 5th.  Above is an example of specific resistances/supports where historically, they have held and broken through. Any major moves above the neutral Fibonacci extension at 0.5 would add confirmation to the bullish bias for the short term.  If however, bitcoin is unable to break that key resistance, a retracement would be more likely whereby the price would need to come down as conditions become overbought.  Prices generally retract or extend between the 38.2 percent, 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels and are best used in conjunction with other technical indicators such as the exponential moving averages previously mentioned or trading volume.  Tool #3: Trading Volume  Another telling sign for traders is the total volume for an underlying stock or asset, so the amount of bitcoin that changed hands in a 24-hour period can be a crucial tell into whether or not the move above $7,000 is meant to last.  Above, we see how volume for bitcoin reached a 3-month high yesterday, almost doubling the day prior.  As volume increases over a general period, the price action becomes stronger as there is more liquidity and greater buy/sell opportunities to be had than in a low liquidity market.  Keep a keen eye on the volume as it is one of the greatest indicators in determining the strength of a particular move in relation to the amount traded.
