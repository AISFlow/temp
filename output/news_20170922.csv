42427801,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vZh,1506115868,Money Manager Josh Brown: 'ICOs Are Where The Frauds Will Take Place',"Josh Brown, the money manager and bitcoin bear-turned-bull, had some harsh words for initial coin offerings (ICOs) in a new blog post: in his words, the funding model is ""where the frauds will take place.""  Writing on his Reformed Broker blog, Brown – who earlier this month told CoinDesk that he thinks ICOs will ""blow up in everyone's face"" – reiterated his position, citing the incredulity shared by West Loop Partners general partner Jeff Carter in a new blog post of his own.  He wrote:  ""Jeff's a friend of mine but he comes at these things from a Chicago floor trader – turned angel investor's mentality. I come at these things from a reformed stock broker's perspective. We don't always see eye to eye but, in this case, we've arrived at exactly the same place. ICOs are where the frauds will take place.""  He blasted ICO-derived tokens as serving as little more than unregistered securities, stating that, unlike some cryptocurrencies, those pieces of data can only be used in conjunction with a particular app or platform.  ""Unlike traditional securities sales, there is no regulation here. I can say that I'm starting a walrus sex ranch and that the digital token I am using to raise the capital will be good for two hours of sex with one of my walruses,"" he wrote. ""You buy five of my tokens, because you've always wanted to make love to a walrus, and this gives you the right to ten hours of unadulterated bliss with my product once I've raised enough from maniacs like you to go into operation.""  His comments come as securities regulators around the world more closely scrutinize the ICO model or develop new rules around them. Despite warnings from some governments that token sales may constitute securities offerings, institutional investors have moved in recent months to capitalize on the interest around them by backing dedicated hedge funds or taking part in ICOs directly.  Brown concluded by saying that, from his perspective, overall enthusiasm for the tech or cryptocurrencies in particular shouldn't preclude a degree of skepticism about ICOs, which to date have generated more than $2 billion in investments, according to data from CoinDesk's ICO Tracker.  ""It's okay to be bullish or even bull-curious about blockchain and bitcoin without being a credulous, fanatical moron about ICOs. This is where I stand,"" he wrote.

42427802,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vXh,1506106828,EU Budget Amendments Call For Millions in Blockchain Funding,"As many as four blockchain-related amendments, funding various initiatives, could find their way into the European Union's 2018 budget.  Public documents published yesterday reveal a proposal to use blockchain as a payments rail for an EU-wide free Wi-Fi access project, as well as funding proposals for two working groups dedicated to the tech.  There are actually two amendments related to the idea of using blockchain as part of the ""WiFi4EU"", including one from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats political party as well as the Parliamentary Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The party has proposed allotting €10 million euros to the initiative, whereas the committee has proposed just €1 million euros.  The aim, according to the amendments, is to test ""the feasibility and demonstrate the usefulness of using blockchain technology in the interaction between the EU Institutions and the citizens.""  The budget document goes on to explain:  ""As a starting point, the project will aim at underpinning the voucher scheme of the Wifi4EU project with blockchain technology, allowing for transparent and traceable payment of EU funds to the private companies, which install the Wifi4EU infrastructure. It will also provide the citizens with the tools to examine the transactions registered in the ledger. It will rely on Open Source software and seek collaboration with Member States for providing blockchain services (also known as Govchains).""  WiFi4EU was first unveiled in May with a budget of €120 million euros, with a goal to offer free connectivity across the bloc over the next three years.  The 2018 budget also includes a proposal to use DLTs as part of humanitarian efforts by the EU to help companies and groups which aid ""migrants [and] displaced groups,"" among others. CoinDesk previously reported on efforts within the European Parliament to advance this use case.  The €1 million euro investment will also go in part towards companies developing DLT platforms which can aid the union in this effort.  An additonal €1 million euros  will go toward the Horizontal Task Force on Distributed Ledger Technology, which aims to analyze how the parliament can effectively utilize DLTs applications. The task force was first announced in 2015, and was originally formed to watch the development of blockchain and DLT platforms.

42427799,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vVh,1506099620,Ethereum's Byzantium Hard Fork Postponed For Further Testing,"The planned roll-out date for ethereum's ""Byzantium"" upgrade is being postponed by just over a week.  The hard fork for Byzantium – the first leg in ethereum's Metropolis update – will now occur at block number 4,370,000, or about October 17 given current block production metrics. The original expected launch date was October 9, barring any complications during testing.  The delay follows a suggestion made by ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who recommended in a core developer discussion today that the platform should be conservative relative to previous forks.  ""We're not in an emergency situation,"" Buterin said.  The suggestion was made, in part, in order to nudge miners into adopting the hard fork more successfully. This is because the difficulty increase intended to incentivize miners to swap onto a different chain has not become too high, and blocks would still be mineable throughout October.  Buterin wanted to push the release right to the end of the month, but was discouraged due to the scheduling clash with the ethereum developer conference in early November.  The date for the hard fork is now ""pretty much final"" according to developer Hudson Jameson – unless of course, something goes wrong in the test period.  The testing phase for Byzantium on the Ropsten testnet officially kicked off on Tuesday, and to date everything is running as expected. The blockchain even verified its first private transaction following the fork.  However, that's not to say it hasn't been without some minor hiccups. A malicious user attacked the Byzantium testnet yesterday filling entire blocks with expensive spam contracts. However, Buterin dismissed the attack as ""fairly inconsequential.""  Going forward, coordinated efforts, described by Buterin as ""groups of people throwing whatever junk on the ethereum blockchain that they want to"" will continue on Ropsten to ensure that all ethereum clients can handle the changes that are incorporated into Byzantium.

42427805,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vfh,1506096028,"Investor Doug Casey: Bitcoin May Be Money, But It Still Might Fail","Investor and anarcho-capitalist Doug Casey recently argued that bitcoin qualifies as money – even if he's not sure it'll last in the long term.  In an interview published yesterday, the Casey Research founder discussed his viewpoints behind bitcoin. During the chat, he noted that he first got into bitcoin back when it was valued at around $13, thanks to a gift of a physical bitcoin he received.  Casey notably argued that bitcoin meets the characteristics defined by the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Namely, that it is divisible, durable, convenient to use (in some circumstances) and consistent, according to Casey. At the same time, Casey returned to a belief that he previously held but now argues is wrong: that bitcoin has no ""use value.""  He explained in the interview.  ""If you have a million US dollars and nobody accepts them, they have no use in and of themselves. They're just unsecured liabilities of a bankrupt government. Like a million Zimbabwe dollars. And a fiat currency is easily destroyed by its issuer. The things are burning matches. They have half-lives, like radioactive elements. And I said that was the problem with bitcoin. But I was wrong about that.""  Going on to call bitcoin ""an excellent transfer device"" that sits outside of the traditional banking system, Casey said that his original argument against bitcoin's use value was invalid.  ""So, this is the use value of bitcoin. It allows you to transfer something that is accepted as money outside of the banking system, and outside of fiat money currencies,"" he said.  However, Casey was less bullish on the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency. He argued that while he believes that bitcoin meets the conditions to serve as a form of money, this state of affairs won't last forever.  ""The bottom line, bitcoin passes the medium of exchange test for the moment and store of value test for the moment. So you can definitely say it's money – for the moment,"" he said, adding:  ""But so's the Argentine peso. I have little confidence bitcoin will be here say five years from now.""

42427794,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vJh,1506092427,CFTC Sues New York Man Over Alleged $600k Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme,"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed a lawsuit against a New York-based man and his company for allegedly running a bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme.  Nicholas Gelfman and his firm, Gelfman Blueprint Inc (GBI), are accused of procuring over $600,000 from 80 people between January 2014 and approximately January 2016.  According to the CFTC, the funds were solicited from customers under the pretence of sponsoring a high-frequency bitcoin trading algorithm called ""Jigsaw."" Legal documents state that GBI falsely claimed that, through their investment, customers could enjoy a 7–9 percent monthly increase in bitcoin.  However, the CFTC summarises that:  ""In fact, the strategy was fake, the purported performance reports were false, and – as in all Ponzi schemes – payouts of supposed profits to GBI customers in actuality consisted of other customers' misappropriated funds.""  While GBI reportedly advertised itself as the ""world’s largest and most advanced cryptocurrencies exchange,"" the company's bitcoin address allegedly shows ""no bitcoin trading activity at all after early July 2015, and a bitcoin balance of zero beginning in early August 2015.""  Gelfman allegedly tried to conceal the Ponzi scheme by claiming the company had been hacked, and that all customer funds had been stolen as a result.  Speaking in a release on the agency's website, James McDonald, the CFTC's Director of Enforcement, stated that, as part of its commitment to fintech innovation, the watchdog must pay careful attention to scammers misusing bitcoin.  McDonald said of the GBI case: ""As alleged, the defendants here preyed on customers interested in virtual currency, promising them the opportunity to invest in bitcoin when in reality they only bought into the defendants' Ponzi scheme.""  He added that the CFTC will continue to ""work hard to identify and remove bad actors from these markets.""

42427813,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vnh,1506088831,Gravity's Pull? Litecoin Is Down 50% from All-Time Highs and Looking Lower,"The litecoin-U.S. dollar (LTC/USD) exchange rate is again trading below $50, just three weeks after setting a new all-time high just below $100.  While the sell-off is in line with the broader market weakness, it may be alarming given the recent losses and the lack of signals for a bullish reversal. As of writing, the cryptocurrency (known as ""silver to bitcoin's gold"") was trading at around $45.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, litecoin has shed 11 percent in the last 24 hours. On a weekly basis, litecoin's price is down 14 percent, and, for the month, it's down 1 percent.  Perhaps most notable, however, is that the cryptocurrency has lost more than 50 percent of the gains its achieved during its tech-influenced revival earlier this year, during which it climbed from $3.27 (September 2016 low) to $100 (September 2017 high).  Adding uncertainty is that litecoin-specific news has been upbeat.  Earlier this week, Coinbase has announced the inclusion of litecoin, as well as ether, in its ""vault"" service – adding an extra layer of security over the standard Coinbase wallet. The development, however, seems to have received little attention, as evident from the 11 percent drop in litecoin prices yesterday.  Price action analysis suggests the pain period is not over yet, and the gravity pull could gather speed over the weekend.  200 SMA could be put to the test  Daily chart  Litecoin's 200 simple moving average (SMA) is located at $33.52 – interestingly, almost coinciding with last Friday's low of $33.56  If the price keeps dropping, the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $40.01 could offer support.  4-hour chart  It's worth noting that the sharp recovery from last Friday's low of $33.56 ran out of steam around the downward sloping 50-SMA, where prices have now formed a lower high.  The relative strength index (RSI) remains bearish. The rally from $33.56 lacked substance/buying pressure, as suggested by the decline in the average true range (ATR) – a volatility indicator that reveals the degree of interest or disinterest in a move.  A bearish reversal with an increase in ATR shows strong selling pressure. The ATR is showing signs of life, which means the sell-off in litecoin could gather pace.  The price chart also shows a bearish crossover (short-term moving average cuts long-term moving average from above) between 50-SMA and 200-SMA.  View  Litecoin is likely to test 200-SMA support of $33.52 in the short-run.  Upside is likely to be capped around the downward sloping four-hour 50-SMA.  Only a break above the trend line sloping downwards from the record high and September 8 high would signal bearish-to-bullish trend change.

42427795,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vNh,1506085208,Mastercard Hints at Plans for Blockchain Settlement System,"Mastercard may be looking to integrate blockchain into its payments infrastructure.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published a new application from the financial giant this week that outlines a solution for a ""uniform settlement system"" – one that would help ease some of the friction involved with business-to-business payments. Specific issues cited in the application include growing data storage demands and the overall volume of transactions.  Notably, Mastercard suggests in the text that such a system could include a blockchain-based ledger of transactions.  As the application explains:  ""In some embodiments, the ledger may be a blockchain configured to store the associated data. ... In the system, the data values may include the purchase orders, invoices, transaction data, and other data stored in the ledger as discussed herein.""  Mastercard clarified that the blockchain would be able to automatically note all changes made to the ledger, creating a verifiable and immutable record of all data. As a result, malicious users would be unable to modify transactions in the system.  The entry represents the latest intellectual property play by Mastercard that invokes blockchain, in a series of applications that goes back to 2014.

The Banco Central del Uruguay (BDC) announced Wednesday that a limited number of users would help testing a mobile-based app for the transfer of funds.  Speaking at an event called ""The Future of Money and the Financial System,"" BCD President Mario Bergara said that the digital currency would function like cash, allowing for balances to be passed between individuals.  According to a report from the Latin American Herald Tribune, he explained:  ""It's not that you use the phone to order money transfers, as is done today, but having bills in the cellular and being able to pass them on from one user to another.""  Whether the digital currency will run on a blockchain-based platform is still not clear, but central banks around the world, including those in Canada and the U.K., have looked to the technology during similar trials.  While no launch date was announced, the pilot is ""fairly close"" to launch, according to Bergara, with certain technological aspects of the program still to be finalized.  ""It will be a process of trial and error, success and failures,"" he was quoted as saying.  Central banks around the world have been researching new ways of issuing their own digital currencies, including via distributed ledgers.

42427797,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vRh,1506080418,Dimon Knocks Bitcoin Again: Crackdown Likely on 'Worthless' Cryptocurrency,"Jamie Dimon is at it again.  Expanding on his recent criticism of bitcoin, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase bank is again out in the media warning ""it will end badly"" for the tech. In a fresh round of press interviews, Dimon told CNBC he is concerned about a flood of cryptocurrencies – thanks to bitcoin, ethereum and initial coin offerings (ICOs) – and believes governments will soon crackdown on the phenomenon.  Predicting that the scenario will not be pretty, the CEO reportedly stated that authorities will eventually threaten users with imprisonment, forcing the cryptocurrencies onto a black market.  He told CNBC:  ""Right now these crypto things are kind of a novelty. People think they're kind of neat.

42427796,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vPh,1506078020,Radical Academy: Amir Taaki's New Hacker Team Is Spreading Bitcoin in Syria,"Lugging an AK-47, fighting ISIS in Syria – Amir Taaki has seen some shit.  But, through it all, the hacker – best known for writing crypto code in abandoned London flats and creating one of the earliest dark markets powered by bitcoin – has kept the technology at the forefront of his mind. Now, emerging from his latest chaotic period, he's promoting the idea that the cryptocurrency needs to be taken back from central banks, governments and other powers that be.  In his first interview about a new unnamed project – which he simply calls ""the academy"" – Taaki laid out his plan to convert an entire region in northern Syria to a bitcoin-based economy.  While Taaki expects the project to take nearly 20 years to implement, he's completed the first step, recruiting a team of five ""revolutionary hackers,"" who he describes as committed to ensuring bitcoin doesn't fall victim to the same fates as other once-revolutionary technology movements.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Bitcoin is now in that crucial balance where it can either find itself, like the other technology movements that have come before it, confined to irrelevance, or people can start to gather together to try to really, truly think about, on a social level, what bitcoin is really about.""  The idea for the academy came from Taaki's months on the front lines, fighting with a group of revolutionaries — the Rojava Kurds — who believe in direct democracy with little to no government. Financially cut off by embargoes against Syria and facing an inflating Syrian lira ($1 is worth over 500 lira), Taaki began to imagine how the cryptocurrency he had previously worked with could be used to connect the Rojava people in entirely new ways.  Following a period he described as being dedicated to study (after his time in the Middle East, he spent about 10 months in England on house arrest), Taaki drew up a two-year plan for an entity based in Greece that was part hacker collective, part social engineering experiment and part school.  Now with a small team assembled to work toward that vision, Taaki said his next step will be to expand it to as many as 20 individuals within the next eight months.  As part of the early stage work, the academy intends to organize a series of educational events to lay the foundation for a ""large-scale payment network"" powered not by central banks or even the internet, but with a combination of Wi-Fi-enabled ESP 12 modules and counterfeit-proof paper wallets, which he hopes the academy will be able to develop.  But while this might all sound radical, Taaki argues it's actually the normal, everyday people that are living a lie.  ""What's happened in recent years is technology has lost that big vision that it had before, and it has just sunk into now a lot of people escaping into a kind of dreamworld,"" he said. ""Bitcoin really comes at the end point, the tail end of that bigger political movement of the hackers, [but] even bitcoin is experiencing a lot of problems with a lack of vision.""  A new kind of business  Core to the academy's ethos is a synthesis of various existing technology movements, including the free-software movement, the crypto-anarchist movement, the Anonymous movement and the pirate movement.  But while the radical nature of Taaki's different projects, this one being no exception, could seem anti-business in its calls for individual empowerment, Taaki is actually neither full-on iconoclast nor rabid anti-capitalist.  For instance, crucial to a bitcoin-powered economy is the idea of open-source software, which powers not only all public blockchains, but also most permissioned blockchains too.  He describes business-led contributions made to the open source community, such as IBM's Fabric and Intel's Sawtooth – both part of the Hyperledger blockchain consortium now – as ""necessary for the success of free software and open source.""  Central banks, though, he does have a beef with.  In fact, Taaki is skeptical that central bank interest in the technology is anything more than a distraction from bitcoin's potential to empower individuals, but understands they could offer stiff competition for his vision of large-scale adoption and day-to-day use of bitcoin.  ""We need to re-situate the economy back to something that's connected to life and humanity,"" he said. ""And to people's personal sense of fulfillment, and bitcoin ... is a big tool that we use to challenge the power of central banks.""  The roadshow  While challenging central banks is a ballsy move, Taaki is currently undertaking a roadshow of sorts in search of financial sponsors, partner organizations, more ""revolutionary hackers"" and an actual location within Greece for his academy.  Most recently, the roadshow took him to a stage at the Breaking Bitcoin conference in France, where he revealed for the first time, what the academy is all about.  During that talk, he said he wants to make bitcoin the ""national currency of Rojava,"" complete with a series of exchange shops where local bitcoin traders can buy vouchers for any number of products.  The next stop for Taaki is to address the attendees at the M-0 conference in Zug, Switzerland, next month. Hosted by the ethereum-based Melonport asset management platform, the conference is geared toward portfolio managers, investors and lawyers looking to save costs by conducting trades on a blockchain.  For a man who both embraces the power of business to help make his ideas a reality and has in a sense turned his back on traditional finance, such a venue is perhaps both fitting and alien to the programmer.  ""It's not for money that I work,"" he emphasized, concluding:  ""And the people that I surround myself with as well, they should be driven by working on their ideas, not for material gain in this life – because they want to leave something behind, put their image into the world, their ideas, their spirit.""

Origin Energy works in a number of energy fields, including power plant operation, natural gas processing and both commercial and domestic power delivery. As such, the project will see the company using the trial platform to connect customers who want to either buy or sell excess energy, with blockchain creating an immutable record of where energy is being allocated.  With the trial, Origin becomes the latest utility firm to examine the tech's potential in the sector. Major industry companies including BP, Wien Energie and Sweden's Vattenfall have embarked on efforts of their own in recent months, positioning those projects as ways to explore new ways of doing business.  Tony Lucas, an executive general manager for Origin, struck a similar tone in a statement, saying:  ""While it's still fairly early days for this technology, we are keen to explore the potential benefits that peer-to-peer energy trading could offer our customers. Power Ledger is one of a number of emerging technologies we're currently exploring, which we believe could help us meet the changing needs of our customers.""  The trial will run from next month to the end of the year, and will use anonymized customer information while Power Ledger's platform is put through its paces.  The companies said they will look at the ""regulatory and technical implications"" of the system, in addition to monitoring how consumers actually use it, according to Lucas.

42427791,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vDh,1506070839,Bitcoin Developers Reveal Roadmap for 'Dandelion' Privacy Project,"The developers behind a bitcoin privacy solution called Dandelion have unveiled a new roadmap that addresses previously discovered code issues.  Originally launched in January, Dandelion modifies the bitcoin network's payment protocol to conceal the original IP address behind a transaction. It does this by breaking that transaction into two parts, nicknamed the ""stem"" and the ""fluff."" The ""stem"" is the single transaction itself, while the ""fluff"" is an obfuscation method that occurs after the fact.  The proposal was originally opened up for scrutiny as a Bitcoin Improvement Protocol (BIP) back in June, but issues were discovered that ultimately delayed the project. As pointed out by Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell, various faults in Dandelion could lead to its deanonymization over time.  Now, the Dandelion team has come forward to present a strategy for addressing those problems.  An improved Dandelion BIP may still be a while away, though, according to those involved.  ""We have not yet completed a reference implementation, so this update does not include a new BIP. Instead, we’re just outlining the steps we plan to take before an updated BIP,"" one of the developers, Giulia Fanti, said in an email.

42427798,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vTh,1506067216,Raiden ICO: Ethereum Scaling Solution to Launch Publicly Traded Token,"One of ethereum's most highly anticipated scaling projects is preparing to launch a token sale.  To be held this October, the initial coin offering (ICO) for Raiden Network will seek to further fund the development of the payments protocol. Led by blockchain consulting firm Brainbot and its co-founder Heiko Hees, the milestone will be the latest for a project first unveiled in 2015 as a way to increase transaction capacity on the world's second-largest blockchain.  According to the entity, funds will be used to finally complete the network, enabling ethereum users to send payments back and forth at higher volumes, without needing to trust intermediaries.  But, why would users buy the token?  Due to its design, the Raiden Network will likely cost fees. For one, Raiden requires that users ""watch"" their payment channels for a certain period of time to make sure funds aren't stolen. But, users aren't likely to want to sit at their computer and do it themselves.  The ""fix"" is to outsource the watching of the payment channels to other vendors in return for a small payment, and it's here where the Raiden team is looking to insert its tokens, called RDN.  Still, the Raiden team hopes the sale itself will be ""boring,"" claiming they will be doing little to market it.  The team said the current plan is to hold a ""uniform price Dutch auction,"" meaning the price of the tokens would decline in cost over the course of the sale. The hope is this method will generate less hype, as those that know about the sale will have an incentive to stay tight-lipped to buy tokens at a cheaper price.  Still, a similar model arguably did not quite pan out as anticipated for Gnosis, another ethereum-based project that tried a similar model last spring. Despite attempts to discourage speculation, Gnosis tokens sold out quickly, with $12.5 million snapped up in roughly 15 minutes.  Improvements ahead  Elsewhere, the team said the funds would be used for other promised projects.  This includes the completion of uRaiden, a recently announced version of the off-chain solution designed for applications built on top of ethereum that don't need such complex micropayments. And, if there's enough money left, the developers have other projects in mind.  One is Raidos, an early-stage project revealed to CoinDesk that would extend Raiden so that it works for more complicated smart contracts.  ""This makes it possible to run decentalized applications much faster. Features like this are needed if you want a 100 percent fair exchange,"" the spokesperson explained.  Any remaining funds, the team said, would then be used to fund decentralized applications on the Raiden network.
