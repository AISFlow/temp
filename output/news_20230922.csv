17952703,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552560,1695423644,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burn Rate Sees Exponential 627% Jump,"Shiba Inu has seen an impressive recovery in its burn rate after recording a slow start to the week. The recent acceleration could suggest that investors are once again rousing and choosing to actively contribute to the reduction of supply which could lead to an increase in price. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Rises 627% Thursday, September 21, has proven to be one of the best weeks for the meme coin in terms of its burn rate. According to Shiba Inu burn tracking website Shibburn, the cryptocurrency saw a 6277% jump in its burn rate in the space of 24 hours. Related Reading: Is Cardano (ADA) The Worst Investment Of 2023? Here’s What The Data Says This acceleration in the burn rate has seen more than 194 million tokens incinerated in the one-day period across multiple transactions. A number of these transactions carried reasonable amounts of tokens in the millions. However, one transaction stands out as the major reason behind the spike in burn rate. Burn rate up 627% in one day | Source: Shibburn A single transaction was seen carrying over 137 million tokens to the burn addresses. This transaction alone was enough to match the previous day’s figures, and with more contributions from the community, the total tokens burned in the last 24 hours is closing in on 200 million. The burn rate is also up 31.62% in the last week as well. Shibbrun reports that more than 653 million tokens have been burned in this seven-day period. As of the time of writing, there are 410,659,642,147,703 SHIB tokens sitting in the burn address.

Launched less than a month ago, the blockchain has already marked some impressive milestones since then. One of the major milestones is the fact that the total transactions on the network have already crossed the 3 million mark. Additionally, wallet addresses on the blockchain crossed 1.25 million with daily transactions sitting above 42,000. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Update: 530% Spike In Shibarium Metric Could Trigger SHIB Recovery The network has, so far, produced more than 760 blocks while gas fees remain low at 1.55 Gwei. The network also saw a spike in new verified contracts earlier in the week, suggesting that more developers are choosing to build on the network. Shiba Inu lead marketer Lucie also took to X (formerly Twitter) to urge investors to use decentralized exchanges (DEXes) on the network instead of centralized exchanges. According to her, doing so would help accelerate the SHIB burn since the burns are set per transaction. So a rise in usage and transactions would translate to more tokens being burned.

17951035,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552605,1695420050,"Coinbase Holds $25 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin, Becomes Largest Holder With 1M BTC","In a notable discovery, Arkham Intel, a leading blockchain intelligence platform, has identified $25 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) reserves held by Coinbase, the prominent US-based cryptocurrency exchange. This revelation puts Coinbase at the forefront of the Bitcoin landscape, positioning it as the largest Bitcoin entity in the world alongside the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto. The uncovered reserves amount to nearly 5% of the total Bitcoin supply. Coinbase Emerges As Top Bitcoin Holder Arkham Intel’s comprehensive analysis has successfully tagged over 36 million Bitcoin deposits and holding addresses associated with Coinbase. Remarkably, Coinbase’s largest cold wallet alone contains around 10,000 BTC, serving as a testament to the scale of their holdings. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Chart Mirrors Sinister 2019 Shadow: Retrace To $20,000 On The Horizon? However, Arkham Intel suggests that Coinbase’s actual Bitcoin reserves may extend beyond the identified addresses. Based on Coinbase’s recent financial reports, it is highly likely that the exchange possesses thousands more BTC that have yet to be tracked and labeled. Moreover, Arkham Intel’s platform reveals that Coinbase holds substantial amounts of other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. The US-based exchange is reported to possess approximately 1.68 million ETH (Ethereum) valued at around $2.69 billion. Additionally, Coinbase holds 68.59 million LINK (Chainlink) tokens, estimated at $471 million. The stablecoin USDC (USD Coin), pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, is also part of Coinbase’s portfolio, with holdings totaling 222 million USDC. Lastly, Coinbase holds a 921,000 BNB (Binance Coin) valued at approximately $194 million. Base Emerges As Top Contender Surpassing Solana In TVL Rankings In a noteworthy development for the exchange and its new Layer-2 (L2) blockchain, Base has emerged as a formidable contender, surpassing Solana in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL). According to the latest statistics from Defillama, Base, Coinbase’s L2 solution boasts a TVL of $370 million, surpassing Solana’s $310 million. This achievement signifies an important milestone for Base, highlighting its growing prominence and influence in the industry. Notably, Base’s TVL positions it ahead of prominent blockchains such as Cronos, Kava, Defichain, Bitcoin, Fusion, Pulsechain, and Cardano. With its current TVL, Base accounts for approximately 0.96% of the overall $38.14 billion TVL in the DeFi space. Base has secured its place among the top protocols regarding TVL, ranking just behind Mixin, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Arbitrum, BSC, Tron, and Ethereum. This accomplishment highlights the growing prominence of Coinbase’s L2 blockchain within the DeFi landscape. Related Reading: Privacy For All: Brave To Integrate Zcash Protocol On Native Crypto Wallet Data from Dune Analytics reveals that since its L2 launch, Base has successfully bridged a total value of $426.81 million. Of this, 54.4% or $232.19 million comprises 143,467 ether, demonstrating strong support and adoption from the Ethereum community. Additionally, approximately 27.2% of the bridged assets to Base consist of 115,993,548 USDC stablecoins. However, it is not all good news for the firm. Coinbase stocks, traded under the name COIN, are experiencing a significant decline that has been ongoing since July 20. The stocks have declined from the $111 level, followed by the lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the firm and Binance.

Related Reading: Privacy For All: Brave To Integrate Zcash Protocol On Native Crypto Wallet Polkadot developers are now setting their eyes on Asynchronous backing. Sophia Gold, the Engineering Lead at Parity Technologies, said the update is “the most significant evolution of parachain consensus since we launched parachains almost two years ago.” Their goal is to increase the number of parachains to 1,000 by the end of 2024, effectively boosting the network’s transaction processing speeds to over 1 million. Asynchronous backing enables flexible scheduling for our future scaling work through elastic scaling and instantaneous core time. We have a credible roadmap to get Polkadot to support 1,000 parachains and 1m+ transactions per second. The design is there – we know how to scale Polkadot for the indefinite future. The Asynchronous Backing: What It Means For Polkadot With this update, Polkadot is introducing a feature called “pipelining.” This means multiple parachain blocks can be processed simultaneously instead of waiting for one block to be fully validated and included on the relay chain before moving on to the next one. Accordingly, Polkadot would process more transactions every second at any instance, effectively scaling the network without relying on layer-2 solutions common in Ethereum or Bitcoin, for example. Since “pipelining” will enhance throughput, Polkadot will have a higher capacity. For this reason, the developer plans to half blockchain validation time from 12 to 6 seconds. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Chart Mirrors Sinister 2019 Shadow: Retrace To $20,000 On The Horizon? A key feature about Asynchronous backing is that any parachain block that fails to be added to the “relay chain” on the first attempt can be reused. Developers note that this will significantly improve network efficiency due to reduced wastage. It is the combination of pipelining and reusing of parachain blocks that Polkadot developers say opens the door for the number of Parachains to be increased from the current 100 to 1,000. With enhanced on-chain scalability, running more parachains can be more feasible.

17947753,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552582,1695412840,"81 Binance Wallets Withdraw $31 Million In LINK, What This Mean For The Altcoin","Recently, Binance, one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, witnessed an unusual pattern of withdrawals. Particularly, 4.7 million LINK tokens, equivalent to roughly $31.58 million, were suddenly withdrawn over a brief period by 81 newly minted wallets. The event is noteworthy due to the large number of tokens moved and the swift, simultaneous action across newly created accounts. This pattern of withdrawals raises questions about the strategies and intentions behind these movements and what they could spell for the token, LINK. Related Reading: LINK Price Prediction: Chainlink Recovery Stalls But Not Likely Over A Timeline Of The Puzzling LINK Withdrawals On September 18, 2023, Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics platform, identified a bizarre spree of LINK withdrawals. Initially, the observation was limited to approximately 35 new wallets on Binance that had extracted 755,687 LINK, valued at roughly $5.08 million. However, in just a day, the number of LINK tokens and the participating wallets increased, culminating in 81 wallets drawing out 4.7 million tokens. It is worth noting that for those who follow the pulse of the cryptocurrency market, such huge withdrawals, especially from new wallets, don’t go unnoticed and could hint at the beginning of a bullish trend. There are a total of 81 fresh wallets created on Sept 15 started withdrawing $LINK from #Binance on Sept 18. And these wallets have withdrawn a total of 4.7M $LINK ($31.58M) from #Binance so far. Details: https://t.co/hSdkoncNgZhttps://t.co/AzUM8VleQQ pic.twitter.com/4IxdSHtv6C — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 22, 2023 The details were further elaborated in a Google document shared by Lookonchain, which itemized every transaction, breaking down the amount of tokens withdrawn and their equivalent value in US dollars. Among these transactions, the most substantial withdrawal saw a single wallet moving 280,567.67 LINK, translating to $1.88 million—moreover, four of these accounts extracted over 200,000 tokens over the monitored period. The list also highlighted that all the wallets had withdrawn only 5,000 LINK tokens. Decoding The Implications For Chainlink Given the sequence of events, Lookonchain hypothesized that there might be an ongoing whale accumulation. To Clarify, ‘whale accumulation’ refers to large-volume holders or “whales” acquiring a significant amount of cryptocurrency, typically indicative of their bullish sentiment. However, it’s essential to approach such hypotheses with a balanced perspective. While the intent behind these transactions remains elusive, the broader implications for Chainlink and its native token, LINK cannot be ignored. Such movements could influence market sentiment, either buoying confidence among potential investors or creating cautionary tales for the more risk-averse. But as with all crypto dynamics, one event seldom dictates the long-term trajectory.

What’s Next for BTC’s Price?,"Bitcoin (BTC) has held firmly above the $26,000 level this week despite sharp sell-offs in equity markets and the surging U.S. dollar – a victory of sorts given the bearish signals those other moves could’ve portended.  The largest crypto asset by market capitalization changed hands Friday afternoon at around $26,500, slightly up 0.3% since the start of the week.  Meanwhile, the benchmark for U.S. stocks, the S&P 500, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 2.7% and 3.2%, respectively.  IntoTheBlock said in a report that the steady price action was “remarkable” in light of the stock market taking a hit. The analytics firm noted among the potential reasons behind the stability that BTC’s correlation with the Dollar Index (DXY) hit zero, meaning there’s no relationship at all between them.  The number of long-term holders – HODLers in crypto slang – are near an all-time high, IntoTheBlock said, which could be a sign that they are refusing to sell before a potential approval of a spot BTC exchange-traded fund in the U.S.  “Historically, these long-term investors have helped sustain price during bear markets and take profits as new all-time highs are set in bull markets,” the report said.  “This trend appears to signal a bullish cycle for bitcoin may be approaching,” it added. “Though it's unclear how long bitcoin's outperformance will last in a worsening macro environment, on-chain data shows that its long-term investors continue to accumulate regardless.”  Resistance above $27,000  BTC climbed to as high as $27,400 ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, but turned lower “witnessing strong selling pressure,” Rachel Lin, CEO of derivatives decentralized exchange SynFutures, noted in an email.  “Both the 200-weekly moving average and the 200-daily moving average are in the 27,800 level, likely acting as strong resistance in the coming week,” she said, adding that the range between $26,000 and $26,500 acts as a support for prices.  In the options market, $24,000 puts and $35,000 call options have the largest open interest, according to Lin.  “This suggests the market still believes BTC will stay in that range for the foreseeable future,” she said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/22/bitcoin-holding-above-26k-is-remarkable-as-equities-take-a-hit-whats-next-for-btcs-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14321e69c190d89938bb84a5071555e9b021931b-2608x1472.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419544,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEs4T,1695410369,Americans (Seemingly) Aren't Allowed to Put This Economic Theory to the Test,"Prediction market Kalshi is once again being hamstrung by U.S. regulators. According to a closely watched decision, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will not let the licensed betting market offer users a chance to wager on the future makeup of the House of Representatives and Senate this election cycle (or any, for that matter).  There will be no gambling on the future of democracy, it seems.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In a 3-1 vote, the three Democratic commissioners rejected Kalshi’s proposal to introduce “a first-of-its-kind derivative contract” tied to congressional elections, which had been opposed by some lawmakers and other onlookers as something that might tarnish the U.S. elections process.  And to be fair, there’s justification for the CFTC’s decision here.  CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam reportedly said he was concerned the agency was ill-equipped to become an “election cop.” The CFTC regulates derivatives contracts and commodities – like wheat, soybeans and cattle – to foster capital formation in those often hyper-critical markets and occasionally polices fraud and manipulation of the assets under its charge.  The CFTC is not exactly deep pocketed, and it would be a turn of departure for the agency to begin adjudicating something like election fraud had Kalshi’s proposed “events contracts” gone into play. Plus, over a dozen states expressly forbid gambling on elections.  Meanwhile, CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham, who abstained from the vote, didn’t seem to have much of a defense of the proposal when writing in June. Pham, a Republican nominated by Biden, may be a familiar name to some readers of The Node for her punchy dissenting opinion on the recent Stoner Cats case.  Instead of an impassioned defense of markets or waxing philosophic on the economic theory behind information markets, Pham argued that because the U.S. Court of Appeals had allowed PredictIt, an elections-focused prediction market, to remain operating after the CFTC ordered it to halt operators, then Kalshi should be allowed to let people gamble on elections, too.  “[It] is only fair for either both exchanges to list the political control contracts, or neither of them should,” she wrote.  Fairs fair. But if Pham isn’t going to rep the prediction market-loving crypto bros here, then I will.  First, I want to start off by saying that it makes sense the CFTC oversees this nascent sector. Prediction markets let people bet on the likelihood of future outcomes in a way that almost perfectly matches the CFTC’s working and workable definition for “binary options.” A question is posed, and those who think they can guess correctly bet either yes or no.  It also makes sense that the watchdog doesn’t want to get involved in “gaming.” Even putting aside the disastrous effect that would have on casinos as well as the nascent, tax-generating sports betting industry for states, it simply isn’t befitting for the agency that plays such an important role in the process of price discovery and offsetting price risk.  I also recognize that the CFTC has been remarkably (or at least mostly) consistent on the question of elections betting. For instance, in 2012, the CFTC rejected the North American Derivatives Exchange’s application to list “political event contracts.” And I’m sure similar rulemaking goes back decades, if you’re willing to put aside the years the Iowa Electronic Markets and PredictIt operated under “No Action” letters from the CFTC.  See also: Why Crypto Whales Love This Prediction Market  It goes without saying there is a major difference between a corporate entity like Kalshi, which was registered by the agency in 2020, and nonprofits like PredictIt and the Iowa Electronic Market, which are both run by universities and so more likely to pass the smell test for providing “educational” value. Especially considering the checkered history or for-profit prediction markets (not even counting the crypto-based ones).  However, all that said, there's something to the idea that the CFTC is using the levers of regulation to essentially wipe out predictions markets as an industry before it can even get going. There may or may not be something to the psychological and economic theory behind betting markets, but it is significant that a number of academics, corporations and even DARPA have at one point or another seen potential in the idea of crowdsourcing truth.  The so-called “wisdom of the crowd” is basically as accepted an idea as irrational exuberance — with some version of aggregate knowledge standing as the cornerstone to the efficient-market hypothesis that underlies much of modern finance.  And if you want less of a haughty reason, then you can be sure that prediction markets for elections would provide extremely useful data for political scientists. That would be true whether or not Kalshi’s reasoning for launching the service was accurate: allowing companies and individuals to bet upwards of $100 million on congressional elections to hedge against political risks.  I can see why organizations like Better Market and Public Citizen filed public comments against Kalshi’s plans, arguing that bringing more money into U.S. elections would cheapen the practice at a time when trust in our shared democratic institutions is at a low. And can see why some may think that allowing people to bet on the outcome of current events would seemingly contribute to the mass financialization of reality.

17946138,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552549,1695409257,"How An ‘Inconsequential’ Mistake Saw Bitcoin Crash To $8,000","Bitcoin is known to be a very volatile digital asset as its price is often wont to rise and fall unexpectedly, and sometimes without a clear reason. One of these instances of the digital asset flash-crashing was back in 2021 when the price of Bitcoin had fallen 87% on some exchanges in a matter of minutes. However, the mystery behind this flash crash has been unveiled two years after it first occurred. Former Alameda Research Engineer Spills Secret Alameda Research is the sister company of the now-defunct FTX crypto exchange run by Caroline Ellison who served as CEO until it collapsed. Following the bankruptcy, employees at the trading firm have, at various times, come forward to tell stories of what took place at the company. This time around, an ex-engineer Aditya Baradwaj is telling the story of how a simple mistake caused the company to lose tens of millions of dollars. Related Reading: Investment Firm Founder Has An Important Message For Bitcoin Holders Baradwaj took to his X (formerly Twitter) account to reveal how an Alameda employee had unwittingly triggered a Bitcoin flash crash in 2021. According to him, the error was a result of two trading systems operated at the company. PART 2: THE FAT-FINGER or The story of how a misplaced decimal point at Alameda Research caused a market crash that echoed around the world. (1/n) 🧵#SBF #FTX pic.twitter.com/jCykh6rg1o — Adi (e/acc) (@aditya_baradwaj) September 20, 2023 The ex-engineer explained that Alameda had semi-systemic strategies in which a complex automated trading system was controlled by model parameters set by traders. The second was manual trading which would be done when the former could not execute a trade due to a number of reasons. In the case of the trader who triggered the flash crash, they had to manually enter a trade to sell a large tranche of BTC using Alameda’s manual trading system. However, the trader had failed to realize that the decimal point in the trade was off by a couple of spaces, which meant that they were selling the BTC at much lower prices than the current price. The result of this simple error was Alameda selling off a sizable portion of BTC at pennies on the dollar which resulted in a flash crash on multiple exchanges. The crash was most prominent on the FTX and Binance exchanges, where prices fell from $65,000 to $8,000 in a matter of minutes. Covering Up The Bitcoin Crash The aftermath of the flash crash, according to the ex-engineer, involved Alameda rushing to put in place sanity checks that should have been available before any manual trades were executed. He notes that this was not out of the ordinary as they were always waiting for things to break before fixing them at the company. Related Reading: Bloomberg Analyst Lauds Bitcoin Energy Shift Amid Rising Hashrate “That’s usually how things worked at Alameda – we would wait until something broke, and then rush to fix it,” he said. Baradwaj also referred to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried saying that the utility gained after the events outweighed the costs incurred from poor risk checks and hacks. He also pointed to Binance commenting on the flash crash with a statement that blamed a bug in the trading algorithm of one of their institutional traders. “I guess Caroline had made some phone calls,” Baradwaj said, referring to Alameda’s CEO.

The growth in supply of DAI and the attractive yield from Maker's DSR program has been a big driver of capital gains in MKR. Given governance centralization is still a major concern and the new direction of MakerDAO, I think it's wise to wait rather than chase. But this has certainly been a humbling few months and I'm upgrading MKR from sell to hold. This may come as a surprise to some of my followers - maybe not a surprise at all to others - but I occasionally get things wrong. From a crypto asset standpoint, the best example of such an instance might be my late-June article covering the governance token of the DAI (DAI-USD) stablecoin ecosystem MakerDAO (MKR-USD). I called MKR a sell at $700 per coin on June 23rd. Two weeks later, it hit $1,000. As of article submission, it's right around $1,300. And the comments section isn't letting me off the hook: You seem to be utterly wrong Gee, thanks. I'm not wrong, the market is wrong! I'm definitely joking on that last part. But in the interest of reassessment, I think it's worth revisiting MakerDAO today to see if we can get a sense for why MKR is doing the exact opposite of what I expected just three months ago. DAI Supply Growth The most straightforward explanation for why MKR has performed so well over the last few months is the growth in the supply of DAI stablecoins: DAI Supply (MakerBurn) Having gone from a two-year low of 4.44 billion DAI in early August, the supply of the market's third largest stablecoin by market capitalization has grown by 24% in a little over 6 weeks. This is particularly impressive because the general trend in the broader stablecoin market over that same time frame has been a continuation of declines in the total market cap of all stables. DAI Deployment (Dune Analytics/steakhouse) What has almost certainly aided the increase in DAI supply is the 5% return from the DAI Savings Rate program, or DSR. That rate was briefly 8% earlier this summer. In late June, there were about 190 million DAI stablecoins in the DSR. That represented roughly 3% of the DAI supply at the time. Now, DAI in DSR has exploded to over 1.5 billion DAI. Which is just under 29% of DAI supply. Assets by Category (Dune Analytics/steakhouse) Importantly, the collateral backing this DAI supply has become increasingly more reliant on real world assets - specifically US treasuries through various vaults, including reputable firms like BlockTower. The reliance on competing stablecoins is down from 66% earlier this year to just 19% today. That's a good thing, as it minimizes exposure to other assets that could theoretically lose pegs. Fees, Earnings, and Buybacks The recent surge in protocol fees is admittedly impressive. There were just $2.9 million in Maker fees back in May. That figure spiked to over $17.3 million in August: Maker fees (Token Terminal) The increase in fees earned by the Maker is a large driver of these MKR returns. Again, the reason is due to favorable tokenomics as MKR holders take those protocol fees. Annualized Earnings v Profit (MakerBurn) It's a little difficult to tell from the chart above, but the annualized profit estimate from the Maker protocol flipped from negative to positive right around the time FTX collapsed in November 2022. It should be noted though that even as annualized fee income keeps moving higher, the profit estimate still remains below Maker's 2023 high of $89.5 million back in July. MKR Outstanding (Dune Analytics/steakhouse) Another factor that has helped propel MKR higher even as earnings have come down since July is the MKR buyback program. We can see MKR outstanding decline from 913k MKR tokens in July to a little over 903k MKR tokens currently. If MKR remains deflationary and annualized fees continue moving higher, MKR is likely well positioned to continue returning value to token holders. Of course, this isn't still without risk. Risks I still have the same concerns regarding the centralization of MakerDAO governance that I had 3 months ago. 16 wallet addresses currently hold more than half of the MKR in circulation. At 15% of holdings, the retail cohort of MKR supply hasn't budged in over two years: Holder breakout (IntoTheBlock) On the flip side, one of the more notable holders of MKR tokens sold 500 coins in early September , claiming that ""MakerDAO is torpedoing itself in weird directions"" Ethereum (ETH-USD) co-founder Vitalik Buterin sold MKR. On one hand, this could possibly be viewed as a bit of a sour grapes decision. Buterin appears to want to focus more on protocols that utilize Ethereum as collateral rather than US debt. Maker creator Rune Christensen has thrown out the possibility of forking Solana (SOL-USD) as the basis for Maker's ""NewChain."" This would be part of the Endgame strategy for Maker that I detailed in my last MKR article. There is still quite a bit up in the air regarding that plan, and I think it would be wise to wait and see how that plays out before chasing MKR after a nearly 100% gain in a matter of just a couple of months. Summary The cold, hard truth is I've been dead wrong on MKR this summer. I've been wrong on my Seeking Alpha calls before, and I'll certainly be wrong again in the future - hopefully, not too often. I'll reiterate what I said about DAI in my last MKR article; as a concept, I completely understand the desire for a stablecoin that is decentralized and not reliant on fiat as collateral. However, I'd argue the more DAI becomes reliant on US treasuries for collateral backing, the less different it ultimately is from the fiat-backed stables that it competes with.

(ECC) and the Filecoin Foundation. These entities are the leading developers of the Zcash (ZEC) protocol and Filecoin (FIL). Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto Face Turbulence As 10-Year US Treasury Yield Hits 15-Year High Brave Brings Zcash Tools Into Web3 According to an official announcement, the cooperation aims to “improve” privacy for Brave’s Web3 wallet. This feature allows users to transact with cryptocurrencies, including the Basic Attention Token (BAT), which people can earn by interacting with websites. Zcash’s native token, ZEC, will become the latest to integrate with the wallet. The company behind Brave claims that this cooperation underscores its “commitment” to provide privacy tools for its users. The integration will allow users to transact privately or publicly with other users and “have greater control” over their Web3 activity. Zooko Wilcox, CEO of the Electric Coin Co., stated: I’m excited about integrating Zcash into the Brave web browser because privacy should be normal. The Brave browser is a tool that tens of millions of people are using for everyday communication, web browsing, shopping, and other activities. This gives them access to money that respects their security and consent. I’m thrilled for this launch — and what’s to come — as a result of this partnership with Brave and Filecoin Foundation. Since its inception, Brave has provided its users with more control over their data and activity. The company behind the browsers has been increasing its privacy features recently by launching easy ways to delete cookies, profiles, and any traces of interaction with a website. In that sense, Yan Zhu from Brave added: This partnership with like-minded organizations reinforces Brave’s mission for a more private and user-first Web. Not only do we hope to make it simple to use ZEC for private transactions, but we also aim to maximize privacy during key moments of purchase or exchange. More Privacy, More Features In addition to the above, the partners hinted at launching a new privacy-based tool to send and receive messages and multimedia files supported by the Zcash protocol. The content will be stored using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), which supports Filecoin. Related Reading: XRP Hurdle In The Run-Up To ‘Proper Party’ – Will Altcoin Price Slip? Marta Belcher, president of the Filecoin Foundation, said: We’re thrilled to be a part of this important project. We believe cryptocurrency can be the foundation for a better Internet — an alternative to big tech that puts people in control of their own data, protects user privacy and security, and permanently preserves humanity’s most important information. As of this writing, neither ZEC nor BAT has seen any upside driven by the announcement. However, Brave users will likely benefit long-term by leveraging a privacy-oriented tool and an alternative to Google and other big tech companies seemingly growing more hungry for people’s data.

Coinbase has a compelling technical setup with support at $72 and positive indicators, but its fundamentals have deteriorated. Trading volume for Coinbase has fallen significantly, and revenue estimates have dropped, making the stock relatively expensive. Risk assets have been bid down aggressively in the past couple of months, as typically weak seasonality has taken hold. The equity indices have all come down since July as investors are selling everything, with the notable exception of cryptos. We all know cryptos have a mind of their own when it comes to the generally volatile trading action they produce, but cryptos are undoubtedly a risk asset. With the buoyant action we've seen in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) lately, stocks that are linked to cryptos - like Coinbase (COIN), stand to do well so long as cryptos hold up. Below, we'll take a look at what is a fairly compelling setup technically in Coinbase, but balance it with some less-than-favorable fundamental factors. The last time I covered Coinbase, I downgraded the stock on a variety of factors. The stock has exploded higher since then, so I was wrong. Right now, I think the setup is better than it was a few months ago, but keep in mind this one moves quickly in both directions, so it's not for everyone. Critical support just below Let's start with the chart, which shows a massive selloff from the high made several weeks ago. However, critically, support has not yet been lost. StockCharts That support level is ~$72, which Coinbase bounced off of yesterday. So long as that level holds, it's a potential long. Below that, support levels get really messy, so I wouldn't be interested if that level fails. Now, the PPO and the 14-day RSI both support the bulls as the pair are putting in a positive divergence. That doesn't guarantee us a bounce here, but it certainly boosts the odds. The bottom panel shows Coinbase's correlation to that of Bitcoin, which has been extremely high recently. I've plotted a 50-day correlation, so it's an intermediate-term indicator, but sits a 0.80 right now. That means the two are moving very closely to one another, so it's quite useful to look at Bitcoin for clues as to Coinbase's next move. Bitcoin has been far from bullish in the past several months, but it's held the zone of support near $25k a bunch of times this year. Just like the $72 level on Coinbase, this level is critical for Bitcoin and so long as it holds, the bulls are in control. StockCharts We see the momentum indicators have improved immensely recently, so again, the odds here are for higher prices so long as support holds. The other thing is that seasonality is unbelievably bullish for Bitcoin in October, which is just a week away. StockCharts In the past five years, October has been up 4 times and averaged 16% gains for Bitcoin. Seasonality is a secondary indicator, but this kind of overwhelming bullishness - literally the best month of the year for Bitcoin - is hard to ignore. Given the chart, and this seasonality, I'm inclined to think a run in Bitcoin is coming, and probably soon. Here's the problem Coinbase's fundamentals have deteriorated while the stock has held up pretty nicely, which means it's now more expensive than it was. From a fundamental perspective, then, the outlook is not so rosy. Trading volume has fallen off a cliff and is showing literally no signs of life. Company presentation Trading volume was off by about a third QoQ in the second quarter of this year, and a fraction of what it was a year ago. Coinbase needs trading volume to pick up for the fundamental case to improve, and it just hasn't. On the plus side, trading volume tends to rise when cryptos are in a bull market, so if Bitcoin does see its typical rise into the fall months, it's possible we see an uptick in Q4 trading volume. It's way too early to know if that will occur, but if anyone needs Bitcoin and cryptos to rally, it's Coinbase. Of course, a Bitcoin rally is no guarantee that volume will improve, and if it doesn't, Coinbase's fundamentals will likely remain weak. However, when cryptos do rally, it's generally very good for firms that help transact in them. I've focused on Bitcoin because it's the OG crypto and the largest, but it ""only"" accounts for about two-fifths of transaction revenue for Coinbase. The balance is in Ethereum (another fifth) and then everything else comprises the remaining two-fifths. Company presentation However, cryptos tend to trade directionally with each other, so using Bitcoin as a proxy for all cryptos works pretty well. Just know that Coinbase could certainly use a rally in Bitcoin, but it will take a full crypto bull market to fully recover the lost trading volume. Now, revenue estimates for Coinbase have plummeted, as you'd expect given the decline in trading volume, which isn't a good look for the bulls. Seeking Alpha However, the good news for the bulls is that estimates leveled out a while ago, and have been pretty flat. Does that mean the damage is done? Each investor can make that judgment for themselves, but it is beginning to look that way. I mentioned the stock has become relatively more expensive in recent months, and below, we can see why. TIKR The stock's P/S ratio is now up to 6.1X, which is near the highest it's been since the spring of 2022. Shares had much higher valuations before that during the COVID buy-everything rally, when Bitcoin was over double the price it is today. However, that's not indicative of today's conditions, or anything close for that matter. I would be surprised if we see valuations like 10X or 12X or 14X sales again for that reason. There's no way for me to think the stock is cheap, and it almost looks like the stock has been bid up in anticipation of a bull market in cryptos. That's not a great outcome for the bulls, as the fundamental case for Coinbase is pretty tenuous in my view given this valuation and collapse in trading volume. If we wrap this up, we have a trading volume that is in a trough that seems to keep getting deeper. However, if Bitcoin is about to move meaningfully higher in October - as it generally does - that may be about to change. This would be the primary catalyst that could drive the stock higher in the coming months, should it occur. I like the technical picture on the price chart for both Coinbase and Bitcoin, as both have held important support levels. But Coinbase's valuation leaves a lot to be desired, and I cannot help but think shares have been bid up in anticipation of favorable seasonality for cryptos. With all of this in mind, I'm sticking a neutral rating on the stock. The valuation has me cautious, but so long as price support is respected, I cannot put a sell on it. Should support at ~$72 break decisively on a closing basis, I would not hang around as that would be a loss of major support. On the upside, the recent high in the mid-$80s would be the first stop.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4636797-coinbase-bullish-seasonality-but-is-that-enough?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17943710.jpeg

42419541,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEs0L,1695402827,Ether Turns Inflationary as Network Revenue Plunges to 9-Month Low,"Ether (ETH) has reverted to be inflationary amid plunging activity on Ethereum, which could weigh on the token’s price, analysts say.  Network fees, a proxy for usage, plunged more than 9% this week to $22.1 million, lowest in nine months, data by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows.  Consequently, the supply of ETH, Ethereum’s native token, has been increasing as fewer tokens were destroyed – burned – to verify transactions than created, Ultrasound.money data shows.  The decline in network fees is partly driven by the adoption of layer 2 networks and will likely continue in the near term, Lucas Outumuro, research head at IntoTheBlock, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  “[This trend] may be putting some pressure on the second largest crypto-asset, as its supply has been growing over the past month, reverting its deflationary trend,” IntoTheBlock wrote in a report.  Ether’s deflationary narrative emerged after last year’s Merge, a major upgrade for the network that saw Ethereum transitioning from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake, profoundly altering the cryptocurrency’s supply dynamics.  During busy periods, the network burns more tokens than created, curbing its supply, which is usually considered bullish for the price. However, when network demand is low, the dynamic flips.  IntoTheBlock joined a roster of crypto observers who noted bearish developments for ETH.  JPMorgan analysts said in a report earlier this week that Ethereum’s much-anticipated Shanghai upgrade failed to boost network activity, as transaction counts, active addresses and total value locked on the blockchain have all fallen since April.  Crypto services provider Matrixport reiterated its negative outlook for the crypto asset compared to BTC in a Friday market update, citing “shockingly low revenues” and “lack of buzz” around the next protocol update. The firm forecasted earlier this month that ETH could fall to as low as $1,000 if the trend continues.

With no positive macro news to drive BTC beyond upper resistance lines, industry experts are looking for a chart analysis that suggests BTC may be on the verge of a significant move toward $20,000. This potential lower price point could serve as a new higher low in Bitcoin’s 1-week chart, reminiscent of its trajectory in 2019 before the halving event. Related Reading: Bankrupt FTX Exchange Turns Its Attention To Employees, Here’s How Much It Wants Bitcoin Chart Flashing Red Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently shared a chart on X (formerly Twitter) outlining Bitcoin’s potential downward trajectory. According to Rekt Capital’s analysis, Bitcoin may revisit the $20,000 mark, establishing a new higher low on its 1-week chart, mirroring the price movement observed in 2019 before the halving event. Rekt Capital highlights the significance of a revisit to the Macro Higher Low in the current cycle, which could occur in early 2024, coinciding with the halving year. In the four-year cycle, this would signify that the downside wick of Candle 4 would form a Macro Higher Low relative to Candle 3, as seen in another chart shared by Rekt below. While some argue that another drop into the Macro Higher Low is unlikely due to the COVID-19 crash in March 2020 as a black swan event, Rekt Capital emphasizes that the magnitude of a potential upcoming drop may differ considerably. The COVID-19 crash resulted in a 72% drop from the 2019 local top to the March 2020 higher low. However, if the 2023 local top were around $31,000, it would only require a 37% drop to revisit the higher low. While a repeat of the -72% crash is unlikely, Rekt Capital suggests that Bitcoin could retrace -37% without needing another black swan event. With Bitcoin being 210 days away from halving in April 2024, Rekt Capital parallels the 2019 cycle, during which BTC experienced a relief rally before forming another lower high. All around, Bitcoin appears to be experiencing a similar relief rally. Rekt Capital suggests that Bitcoin may not need a drastic crash or another black swan event over the following months to reach its Macro Higher Low in this cycle but rather a retracement of approximately 27% from current prices.

42419543,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEs3R,1695400972,"Google Cloud Pushes Deeper Into Blockchain Data, Adding 11 Networks Including Polygon","Google’s cloud-computing business is expanding its push into blockchain, adding 11 networks including Polygon, Optimism and Polkadot to its ‘BigQuery’ program for public datasets.  The business, Google Cloud, first published a post in February 2018 announcing that Bitcoin blockchain data was available for exploration through the program. Since then 10 additional networks have been added, including Ethereum, Litecoin and Dogecoin.  BigQuery is a “serverless and cost-effective enterprise data warehouse,” designed for “practitioners of various coding skills,” according to the program’s website.  A key advantage, according to Google Cloud, is that users might be able to retrieve the historical data from an off-chain provider faster than querying the blockchain directly.  Friday's announcement comes as Google Cloud says it's expanding efforts in blockchain despite the industry still being mired in the ""crypto winter"" market malaise.  “Over the past 18 months we’ve been investing in this space, we’ve continued to hire, we’ve continued to grow not only our business development and our go-to-market teams but also our product and engineering capabilities,” James Tromans, global head of Web3, Google Cloud, told CoinDesk TV in an interview last week. “We’re really beginning to show that we’re not just fly-by-night and not just here when the time is going well.”  Avalanche, Arbitrum, NEAR  Other blockchains added recently to the BigQuery program include Avalanche, Arbitrum, Cronos, Ethereum’s Goerli test network; Fantom Opera; NEAR and Tron, according to a press release on Friday.  Google Cloud said it also will improve the Bitcoin BigQuery dataset by adding support for the Ordinals project, which exploded in popularity earlier this year as a way to generate NFTs on the largest and original blockchain network.  The BigQuery program makes historical blockchain data available for exploration, designed to overcome the underlying network’s limited capability for “short time-scale reporting on specific or aggregated money flows stored in the ledger,” according to Google Cloud.  Expanding the program to include more blockchains also has allowed for “multi-chain meta analyses, as well as integration with conventional financial record processing systems,” the company said.  According to the press release, blockchain foundations, Web3 analytics firms, developers and customers are demanding “a more comprehensive view across the crypto landscape, and to be able to query more chains.”  Data queries might focus on the number of NFTs minted across three specific blockchains, fee comparisons between networks or how many active wallets sit atop chains that are compatible with the widely popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) programming environment.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | SPONSORED | ARB,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/22/google-cloud-pushes-deeper-into-blockchain-data-adding-11-networks-including-polygon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/005414a9160f5e28fc0ac435a57795ae43aab306-1143x643.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

XRP Ledger Surpasses 82 Million Ledgers XRP Ledger, a decentralized public blockchain backing the XRP token has gained recognition for its unique consensus algorithm and incorporation of the XLS-20 protocol. The leading cryptographic ledger reported that it had closed approximately 82,035,421 registered ledgers on its blockchain. Related Reading: Is $10,000 Possible For XRP Price? Crypto Analysts Weigh In This achievement follows another milestone in August where XRPL successfully locked in 81 million ledgers. The blockchain ledger’s rapid growth has been a significant achievement for the ecosystem, emphasizing XRPL’s commitment to decentralization and focus on speed, scalability, and security. A blockchain researcher, Collin Brown announced details of XRPL’s recent achievements in an X (formerly Twitter) post on Thursday, September 21. Brown was enthusiastic about the current development in the XRP ecosystem and even suggested that the XRP blockchain ledger is on its way to becoming an adversary to crypto giants in the space like Bitcoin and Ethereum. “With over 82 million ledgers successfully closed, the XRPL continues to make history. The XRPL’s growth in NFTs positions it as a STRONG competitor to Ethereum, paving the way for increased XRP adoption!” Brown said. XLS-20 Feature Drive Crypto Adoption And Growth For XRPL The XRP Ledger has long been celebrated for its advanced scalability and decentralization features. However, with the introduction of the XLS-20 feature in 2022, XRPL has emerged as a force to be reckoned with in the NFT ecosystem. The XLS-20 protocol delivers new features to the XRP ledger. According to Brown, XLS-20 is integrated with special features like minting and burning, automated royalties, DEX integration, and traditional NFTs. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts More Trouble Ahead For Bitcoin Price, Here’s Why XRPL has also recorded over 1.9 million NFTs minted on the ledger and almost 30,000 user accounts own 1.6 million of the minted NFTs.

42419542,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEs2P,1695394901,"AI Should Be Decentralized, but How?","The intersection of Web3 and artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in the form of generative AI, has become one of the hottest topics of debate within the crypto community. After all, generative AI is revolutionizing all areas of traditional software stacks, and Web3 is no exception. Given that decentralization is the core value proposition of Web3, many of the emergent Web3-generative-AI projects and scenarios project some form of decentralized generative AI value proposition.  Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock.  In Web3, we have a long history of looking at every domain through a decentralization lens, but the reality is that not all domains can benefit from decentralization, and for every domain, there is a spectrum of decentralization scenarios. Breaking down that idea from a first principles standpoint leads us to two key questions:  Does generative AI deserve to be decentralized?  Why hasn't decentralized AI worked at scale before, and what's different with generative AI?  What are the different dimensions of decentralization in generative AI?  These questions are far from trivial, and each one can spark passionate debates. However, I believe that thinking through these questions is essential to develop a comprehensive thesis about the opportunities and challenges at the intersection of Web3 and generative AI.  Does AI Deserve to be Decentralized?  The philosophical case for decentralizing AI is simple. AI is digital knowledge, and knowledge might be the number one construct of the digital world that deserves to be decentralized. Throughout the history of Web3, we have made many attempts to decentralize things that work extremely well in a centralized architecture, and where decentralization didn't provide obvious benefits. Knowledge is not one of the natural candidates for decentralization from both the technical and economic standpoint.  The level of control being accumulated by the big AI providers is creating a massive gap with the rest of the competition to the point that it is becoming scary. AI does not evolve linearly or even exponentially; it follows a multi-exponential curve.  Read more: Jesus Rodriguez - How DeFi Protocols Are Building More Granular and Extensible Capabilities  GPT-4 represents a massive improvement over GPT 3.5 across many dimensions, and that trajectory is likely to continue. At some point, it becomes unfeasible to try to compete with centralized AI providers. A well-designed decentralized network model could enable an ecosystem in which different parties collaborate to improve the quality of models, which enables democratic access to knowledge and sharing of the benefits.  Transparency is the second factor that can be considered when evaluating the merits of decentralization in AI. Foundation model architectures involve millions of interconnected neurons across several layers, making it impractical to understand using traditional monitoring practices. Nobody really understands what happens inside GPT-4, and OpenAI has no incentives to be more transparent in that area. Decentralized AI networks could enable open testing benchmarks and guardrails that provide visibility into the functioning of foundation models without requiring trust in a specific provider.  Why Hasn’t Decentralized AI Worked Until Now?  If the case for decentralized AI is so clear, then why haven't we seen any successful attempts in this area? After all, decentralized AI is not a new idea, and many of its principles date back to the early 1990s. Without getting into technicalities, the main reason for the lack of success of decentralized AI approaches is that the value proposition was questionable at best.  Before large foundation models came into the scene, the dominant architecture paradigm was different forms of supervised learning that required highly curated and labeled datasets, which resided mostly within corporate boundaries. Additionally, the models were small enough to be easily interpretable using mainstream tools. Finally, the case for control was also very weak, as no models were strong enough to cause any level of concern.  In a somewhat paradoxical twist, the prominence of large-scale generative AI and foundation models in a centralized manner helped make the case for decentralized AI viable for the first time in history.  Now that we understand that AI deserves to be decentralized and that this time is somewhat different from previous attempts, we can start thinking about which specific elements require decentralization.  The Dimensions of Decentralization in AI  When it comes to generative AI, there is no single approach to decentralization. Instead, decentralization should be considered in the context of the different phases of the lifecycle of foundation models. Here are three main stages in the operational lifespan of foundation models that are relevant to decentralization:  Pre-training is the stage in which a model is trained on large volumes of unlabeled and labeled datasets.  Fine-tuning, which is typically optional, is the phase in which a model is “retrained” on domain-specific datasets to optimize its performance on different tasks.  Inference is the stage in which a model outputs predictions based on specific inputs.  Throughout these three phases, there are different dimensions that are good candidates for decentralization.  The Compute Decentralization Dimension  Decentralized computing can be incredibly relevant during pre-training and finetuning and may be less relevant during inference. Foundation models notoriously require large cycles of GPU compute, which are typically executed in centralized data centers. The notion of a decentralized GPU compute network in which different parties can supply compute for the pre-training and finetuning of models could help remove the control that large cloud providers have over the creation of foundation models.  The Data Decentralization Dimension  Data decentralization could play an incredibly important role during the pre-training and fine-tuning phases. Currently, there is very little transparency around the concrete composition of datasets used to pretrain and finetune foundation models. A decentralized data network could incentivize different parties to supply datasets with appropriate disclosures and track their usage in pretraining and fine-tuning foundation models.  The Optimization Decentralization Dimension  Many phases during the lifecycle of foundation models require validations, often in the form of human intervention. Notably, techniques such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) enable the transition from GPT-3 to ChatGPT by having humans validate the outputs of the model to provide better alignment with human interests. This level of validation is particularly relevant during the fine-tuning phases, and currently, there is very little transparency around it. A decentralized network of human and AI validators that perform specific tasks, whose results are immediately traceable, could be a significant improvement in this area.  Read more: Jesus Rodriguez - A New Blockchain for Generative AI?  The Evaluation Decentralization Dimension  If I were to ask you to select the best language model for a specific task, you would have to guess the answer. AI benchmarks are fundamentally broken, there is very little transparency around them, and they require quite a bit of trust in the parties who created them. Decentralizing the evaluation of foundation models for different tasks is an incredibly important task to increase transparency in the space. This dimension is particularly relevant during the inference phase.  The Model Execution Decentralization Dimension  Finally, the most obvious area of decentralization. Using foundation models today requires trust in infrastructures controlled by a centralized party. Providing a network in which inference workloads can be distributed across different parties is quite an interesting challenge that can bring a tremendous amount of value to the adoption of foundation models.  The right way to do AI  Foundation models propelled AI to mainstream adoption and also accelerated all the challenges that come with the rapidly increasing capabilities of these models. Among these challenges, the case for decentralization has never been stronger.  Digital knowledge deserves to be decentralized across all its dimensions: data, compute, validation, optimization, execution. No centralized entity deserves to have that much power over the future of intelligence. The case for decentralized AI is clear, but the technical challenges are tremendous. Decentralizing AI is going to require more than one technical breakthrough, but the goal is certainly achievable. In the era of foundation models, decentralized AI is the right way to approach AI.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/22/ai-should-be-decentralized-but-how,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/472830dc55c5057b6b4e97bda790198cd1d1b508-2309x1299.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin RHODL Ratio Is Currently Showing A “Dead Cat Bounce” As analyst James V. Straten explained in a post on X, the BTC RHODL ratio may contain hints about when the cryptocurrency’s next bull run could be coming. The “Realized HODL ratio” (RHODL) here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the value held by the investors holding since 6 months and 3 years ago and that held by the 1 day to 3 months old holders. These former investors make up a segment of the larger “long-term holder” (LTH) group. More specifically, this part of the group may be termed the “single cycle LTHs” since their holding range is inside the span of a BTC cycle (typically four years). The other investors, those holding since 1 day and 3 months ago, represent the youngest members of the “short-term holder” (STH) cohort. The entire STH group has its cutoff at the six-month mark, where the LTH group naturally begins. Related Reading: Binance & Deribit Traders Aggressively Short Bitcoin, Squeeze Incoming? As the RHODL ratio compares the value held by these two cohorts, its trend can provide hints about how the rotation of capital occurs in the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin RHODL ratio over the history of the cryptocurrency: The value of the metric seems to have sharply gone down in recent months | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X The above graph shows that the Bitcoin RHODL ratio has followed a similar pattern in each Bitcoin cycle. The metric always hits a bottom during bull run tops and starts heading up. This increase represents a rotation of capital towards the LTHs, as the bear market setting in leads to the STHs giving up on the asset and exiting, while the persistent holders left behind accumulate more at the lower prices. This accumulation from the LTHs continues until the bear market bottom. The graph shows that the RHODL ratio has always seen its top coincide with the cyclical bottoms in the price. Due to the relief rally following the worst bear market stage, STHs return to the market and grow their holdings, while some LTHs sell their coins to take their profits. Related Reading: “Paper BTC” Is Counteracting A Bullish Bitcoin Supply Shock, Analyst Explains In the graph, Straten has highlighted that the indicator has been sharply going down during the past few months, just like it did in the buildup to past bull markets. As noted by the circles, though, the indicator generally experiences a sort of dead cat bounce on the way down. The indicator has recently turned towards the upside, potentially implying that this same dead cat bounce pattern is again forming. Historically, true bull markets have followed when the Bitcoin RHODL ratio has again reversed its direction following this pattern and has resumed its downtrend. A similar reversal may also be the one to watch for this time, as it could lead towards the next bull run.

The alternative cryptocurrency reached its highest point in 45 days and successfully transformed several resistance levels into stable support levels. IMX reached a peak of $0.77, marking a 33% increase from its starting price. Nevertheless, this upward momentum couldn’t be maintained, and there’s now a potential threat to the breakout from a descending resistance line for IMX. The notable surge in the price of IMX can be attributed in part to the implementation of the IMX-Korean won trading pair on Upbit, a cryptocurrency exchange based in South Korea. Related Reading: XRP Hurdle In The Run-Up To ‘Proper Party’ – Will Altcoin Price Slip? Significant Boost For ImmutableX The inclusion of this listing on Upbit resulted in a significant boost, accounting for over 35% of the global trading activity for IMX. This allowed direct trading with the Korean won and increased South Korean trader interest in BW.com. ImmutableX’s $IMX token skyrocketed over 30% following the listing of IMX-Korean won pair on South Korea’s leading exchange @Official_Upbit. The newly listed IMX/KRW pair on Upbit exchange accounted for nearly 20% of the global trading volume.. pic.twitter.com/UcZhiTT7MA — GeckoTerminal (@GeckoTerminal) September 21, 2023 According to data source Coingecko, the IMX-Korean won (IMX/KRW) pair listed on South Korea’s Upbit exchange accounted for roughly 20% of worldwide activity, followed by Binance’s IMX-tether (IMX/USDT) pair, which contributed 7% to total volume. A number of Upbit wallets absorbed millions of dollars’ worth of IMX, according to the Web3 data research application Lookonchain, even though the precise reasons driving up the price are yet unknown. IMX market cap currently at $775 million. Chart: TradingView.com Whales are essential to the dynamics of the market since they own about 87% of the circulating supply of IMX. Their presence can cause losses for other investors, and their activities have a major impact on the market. The number of significant transactions (those over $100,000) has been quite modest in recent weeks, averaging about $7 million, with sporadic little rises occurring every few days. Whale trades barely reached $22.6 million in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, IMX was trading at $0.66, up 33% in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. IMX Derivatives Short-Selling Meanwhile, according to the data provided by CoinGlass, there is evidence of traders actively engaging in short selling of IMX derivatives. This is evident from the notable increase in negative funding rates observed on perpetual swaps. Despite the recent surge, the native token of ImmutableX remains far below its all-time highs recorded during the crypto market bull run at the end of last year. IMX hit an all-time high of more than $9.30 at that time. Related Reading: MakerDAO (MKR) Recent Rally Signals Potential For New Highs – $1,700 On The Horizon? Although the price of the IMX has demonstrated considerable strength, investors should be vigilant for indications of sustained momentum above important support levels and be wary of any potential pullbacks. While the positive signs suggest IMX could remain a market challenger, traders should always put risk management first. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

42419548,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEs7Z,1695391200,Web3 Adventure Game Big Time Poised to Kickoff Its ‘Player-Owned Economy’,"Web3 role-playing adventure game Big Time is emerging from a year-long testing phase and expects to go live in early October.  Big Time aims to bring to its large community a free-to-play experience, without the sort of poorly aligned pay-to-win mechanics that have dogged other crypto-centric games.  Big Time’s creators, which include the former CEO of Ethereum-based virtual world Decentraland and several former AAA game developers, refer to its “player-owned economy,” where gamers can craft, trade or loot digital wearables and collectables in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), driven by a native Big Time cryptocurrency, as they explore ancient civilizations and futuristic worlds.  Once-hyped cryptocurrency-based games such as Decentraland, or the competitive digital pet player Axie Infinity, have encountered problems over time; Decentraland’s metaverse world is commonly criticized because of a lack of participation, while Axie is prone to the insidious effects of its play-to-earn model.  Former Decentraland CEO and Big Time founder Ari Meilich pointed to a strong community behind his new game, and a creative team at Big time Studios who are collectively responsible for games that have attracted tens of millions of users and made hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.  “The Big Time community has already grown to over 350,000 people on Discord and over a quarter million on X (formerly Twitter),” Meilich said in an interview with CoinDesk. “We also have a signup list with over a million people, and have made direct sales in excess of $80 million, plus whatever the users have traded among themselves.”  An important differentiator, Meilich added, is Big Time’s status as the most streamed PC web3 game on Twitch with over 3000 streamers having played its pre-alpha, and a large footprint in critical markets like Japan.  As well as building a sturdy community, Big Time’s economic incentives were carefully created to avoid the play-to-earn trap Axie encountered, which has led to the game being branded a form of “digital serfdom,” heavily reliant on an army of low-wage workers in places like the Philippines.  The game’s native $BIGTIME tokens are not generated purely as a matter of time spent playing, but rather hinge on skill and strategic use of resources, leading to a meritocratic in-game economy, explained Michael Migliero Chief Marketing Officer at Big Time Studios.  “The first iteration of web3 games had an unsustainable model,” Migliero said via an email. “They required assets that widely fluctuated in price to access the core game. Their economies generated over inflated token supplies, and the tokens didn’t have enough utility sinks. This resulted in a user base seeking largely to profit instead of having fun. They also delivered simple, shallow gaming experiences.”  Big Time’s full in-game economy, known as “Preseason,” begins in early October, Migliero said.

The contracts would have been settled in cash and let users bet on yes or no questions about whether the Republicans or Democrats would control the House and Senate in a given term.  Last year, an appeals court ruled that another prediction market, PredictIt, should be allowed to continue operating until a final court ruling, despite a CFTC order to shut down.

In a flurry of moves to claw back funds for investors, FTX lawyers are now going after employees of Salameda Ltd. According to court filings, the employees of Salameda – a Hong Kong-incorporated entity allegedly controlled by former FTX CEO Bankman-Fried, named as defendants were prioritized over other customers as many raced to withdraw their assets from the exchange before its imminent crash on November 11, 2022. FTX Wants $150 Million Back The filing alleges Michael Burgess, Matthew Burgess, Kevin Nguyen, and Darren Wong, all former employees of Salameda, fraudulently withdrew assets in their FTX accounts just hours before bankruptcy. Court filings suggest that while the defendants worked for Salameda, they were effectively employees of the FTX Group, as they worked in senior-level roles at FTX Group companies. Related Reading: Bloomberg Analyst Lauds Bitcoin Energy Shift Amid Rising Hashrate Before its imminent crash, FTX had been under public scrutiny as many investors had concerns about the exchange’s liquidity and solvency. This prompted many FTX.com and FTX US customers to make withdrawal requests leading up to billions of dollars. As the backlog grew, many had to wait for days for their withdrawals to be processed, with some not receiving their money before the exchange filed for bankruptcy. However, court documents show that the defendants received the benefit of withdrawals ahead of other customers due to their connections to FTX Group executives. Personal messages show one of the defendants, Matthew Burgess, urging other employees to expedite a pending withdrawal request for $73 million from one of Michael Burgess’s accounts on the exchange. The defendants were able to withdraw $157.3 million based on pricing as of August 31, 2023, with the majority of those coming withdrawn on or after November 7, 2022. FTX attorneys are now demanding the full amount be returned, arguing that the funds were improperly transferred to the defendants without the required procedures being followed. Trying To Recover Since filing for bankruptcy in November 2022, FTX has filed several lawsuits hoping to claw back money to pay some of its investors and customers. The exchange’s attorneys filed a similar case in July, as it went after executives of its European subsidiary in a bid to recover $323 million. Related Reading: What The SEC’s Latest Announcement Means For The Crypto Industry Lawyers recently went after Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents, accusing them of misappropriating funds from the exchange while it was still in operation. However, the parents, both law professors at Stanford Law School, dismissed the claims as completely false. Sam Bankman-Fried is set to be tried in court starting on October 3 for eight charges brought against him.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin traded down slightly on Friday after showing resilience earlier in the week. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading around $26,500 and did not witness notable gains over the week. Toncoin (TON) was the top performer over the week, up almost 10%. Toncoin is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, which was developed by the team behind messaging app Telegram. Toncoin was followed by Chainlink’s LINK token, which is up 6% for the week, with most gains happening on Monday following a flurry of announcements on new partnerships with traditional financial institutions.  Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has sued former employees of Salameda, a Hong Kong-incorporated entity affiliated with FTX that it says was controlled by the firm's ex-CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, to recover about $157.3 million, according to a court filing late Thursday. The filing alleges Michael Burgess, Matthew Burgess, their mother Lesley Burgess, Kevin Nguyen, Darren Wong and two companies owned or controlled several firms that had accounts registered at FTX.com and FTX US, and fraudulently withdrew assets in the days leading up to FTX's bankruptcy.  Binance, Binance.US and Changpeng Zhao filed to dismiss a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit Thursday, claiming the regulator hadn't ""plausibly alleged"" various securities-related violations, and that it was seeking to encompass digital assets under its authority despite Congress not explicitly spelling that out in legislation. The SEC sued Binance, Zhao and Binance.US in June, alleging they illegally listed unregistered securities in the form of several cryptocurrencies for trading and investment by U.S. investors. The suit immediately kicked off a legal fight over just who could access Binance.US customer funds. In Thursday's filings, attorneys for Binance and Binance.US said the regulator was overreaching by alleging violations of securities law.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows nominal and inflation-adjusted real yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note have risen to the highest since 2007 and 2009, respectively.  Higher real rates drive investors to hold cash or bonds, disincentivizing risk-taking.

42419545,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEs1N,1695384000,Sam Bankman-Fried Sort of Had a Rough Day,"Yesterday was arguably not a great day for Sam Bankman-Fried. First, the judge overseeing his case rejected all seven of his proposed expert witnesses*, questioning at least one’s qualifications and saying some others really wouldn’t be relevant to the case.  Shortly after, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Bankman-Fried’s appeal of Judge Lewis Kaplan’s ruling to revoke his release on bail.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  These are both mostly procedural losses. I don’t think the appeal denial is a surprise to anyone. Judge Kaplan even joked about his record on appeals (favorable) in the Aug. 11 hearing where he remanded Bankman-Fried into custody, and indeed the three-judge panel wrote that they “discern[ed] no error, much less clear error, in the district court’s detention decision.”  What this means is Bankman-Fried will remain behind bars as his trial begins.  Judge Kaplan’s ruling is a lot more interesting. On the face of it – yes, he granted the Department of Justice’s motions to bar all of the defense’s proposed expert witnesses from testifying. But this is more of a mixed bag: The defense can still try and call four of the witnesses, provided they fill out better disclosures at least three days before they’re supposed to testify. The DOJ can still object to the witnesses as well.  We already know the DOJ plans to call witnesses as soon as the week of Oct. 3, and while I haven’t seen a full or final list of witnesses, we do now have some greater clarity about who we can expect to testify over the course of the trial: Gary Wang, Nishad Singh, Caroline Ellison, an FBI agent, Andria van der Merwe (a specialist in “complex litigation and regulatory investigations related to financial markets,” according to her biography) and Peter Easton (a University of Notre Dame professor who will apparently explain FTX’s financials) for starters.  If the defense successfully calls them up, we may also hear from Thomas Bishop to rebut what Easton says, Brian Kim who may rebut the FBI agent’s statements, Joseph Pimbley to respond to a DOJ witness on FTX’s software and Andrew Di Wu to respond to van der Merwe’s testimony.",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/22/sam-bankman-fried-sort-of-had-a-rough-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419556,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEsGr,1695382812,Dogecoin Beats Bitcoin in Price Stability Amid Crypto Trading Lull,"Volatility in dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme cryptocurrency by market value, has dwindled so much that it now looks more stable than the digital asset industry leader, bitcoin (BTC).  According to TradingView, DOGE's annualized 30-day realized, or historical, volatility was 30% at press time, notably lower than bitcoin's 35%. Realized volatility is calculated as the standard deviation of the daily percentage change in an asset's price over a specific period.  DOGE has historically been more volatile than bitcoin, scaring risk-averse investors, understandably so, as BTC has been around since 2009 and has evolved as a macro asset, with increasing institutional participation over the past three years. DOGE, meantime, has been seen as a non-serious crypto project since its inception in 2013.  The meme coin's new-found status as a less volatile asset shouldn't be taken to imply market maturity, and probably stems from a lack of investor interest in alternative cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin's dominance rate, or the share in the total crypto market, has surged to 50% from nearly 40% this year, a sign of liquidity being drained from alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin. While the BTC price has gained 60% this year, DOGE has lost just over 12%, CoinDesk data show.  Key liquidity metrics like the aggregate 1% market depth tell the same story. That metric measures the bids and asks within 1% of the mid-price for all order books on major crypto exchanges.  The aggregate 1% market depth for the top 10 altcoins was well below that of bitcoin and ether at the end of last month, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko.  There has been a market-wide decline in activity, with trading volumes in the spot market hitting a four-year low of $475 billion in August.  The low liquidity in DOGE and other coins is consistent with the murky regulatory outlook for smaller cryptocurrencies. Early this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in its lawsuit against leading digital assets exchanges Coinbase and Binance, referred to several altcoins as securities. DOGE and SHIB were not mentioned, but potential stricter regulations for altcoins could eventually affect meme coins.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/22/dogecoin-beats-bitcoin-in-price-stability-amid-crypto-trading-lull,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8248233d270316c21dcd28fc6f51fd538ccc02d4-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17934232,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552478,1695382207,Bitcoin And Crypto Face Turbulence As 10-Year US Treasury Yield Hits 15-Year High,"In an environment of soaring interest rates and economic unpredictability, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market face increased headwinds. The shift in the financial landscape was recently underscored by the Benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, which hit a 16-year high this Thursday. Longest Yield Curve Inversion Ever Historically, an inverted yield curve, where short-term yields are higher than long-term ones, has been a harbinger of economic downturns. Notably, the 10-Year minus the 3-Month Treasury Yield curve has been inverted for a record 217 trading days. Past data indicates that the longer the delay between the inversion and the start of a recession, the more severe the recession is likely to be. Joe Consorti, Market Analyst at The Bitcoin Layer, underscored this concern, remarking on Twitter: “The yield curve is re-steepening at breakneck speed. Up by 10 bps or more today across the curve. Do you know what happens when the yield curve steepens, every single time? Hint: not economic expansion.” Related Reading: Ex-Alameda Employee Claims Firm Triggered 87% Bitcoin Price Plummet In 2021 The Fed’s recent signals and policy stance have taken the financial world by storm. Charlie Bilello, Chief Market Strategist at Creative Planning, noted, “The 10-Year Treasury Yield moved up to 4.49% today, highest since October 2007. The Real 10-Year Yield (adjusted for expected inflation) of 2.11% is now at the highest level since March 2009.” Bilello also pointed out the significant reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet, which is currently “over 10% below its April 2022 peak.” The two largest drawdowns over the last 20 years were between December 2008 and February 2009 with 18.2% (balance sheet hit a new high in Jan 2010), and from January 2015 to August 2019 with -16.7% (balance sheet hit a new high in March 2020). The rise in the 10-Year Treasury Yield was reiterated by the analysts from “The Kobeissi Letter,” who stated: “BREAKING: 10-Year Note Yield officially hits our 4.50% target… The 10-Year Note Yield is up an incredible 20 basis points in less than 24 hours… With supply side inflation out of control and oil prices back to $90+, the Fed has no choice. Higher for longer is back.” The Federal Reserve’s Stand During Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, the US central bank and chairman Jerome Powell have made clear its intentions, signaling the potential for an additional rate hike this year and forecasting fewer cuts next year. It now forecasts half a percentage point of rate cuts in 2024. Prior, the dot plot showed cut rates by a full percentage point next year. Related Reading: Why Touching This Bitcoin Level Could Hold The Key For A Rally This “higher for longer” strategy seems to diverge from the market’s prior expectations, despite three months of seemingly positive inflation data. Moreover, Powell conveyed confidence in the US. economy, emphasizing the need to ensure interest rates are adjusted correctly to achieve the central bank’s 2% inflation target. However, the market remains uncertain, with the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicating only a 32% chance of another rate hike in November and a 45% likelihood by December. Implications For Bitcoin And Crypto Risk assets, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, have historically been sensitive to increases in the 10-Year Treasury Yield. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, highlighted the challenges for the Bitcoin and crypto sector: The Fed wants more unemployment. The job market is still too strong. They’ve raised the expected 2024 rates as a result and the 10YR has broken out to new decade highs. As long as the 10YR is breaking upwards like this, risk assets are going to see further headwinds. Historically, rising yields are indicative of an expectation of higher interest rates, which increase the cost of borrowing. This scenario often leads to a reduction in speculative investments, with investors favoring more stable, yield-bearing assets over riskier options such as Bitcoin and crypto. Another problem for the market is the “higher for longer” approach and the massive reduction of the Fed’s balance sheet. Risk assets like Bitcoin are traditionally a “sponge” for high liquidity, but when this dries up in the financial market, they usually suffer the most. In addition, concerns about a possible recession will continue to rise due to the inverted yield curve. Remarkably, Bitcoin and crypto have never traded in a recession, the reaction is uncertain. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $26,655.

17932744,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552476,1695378628,XRP Hurdle In The Run-Up To ‘Proper Party’ – Will Altcoin Price Slip?,"XRP, a cryptocurrency Ripple Labs uses to facilitate transactions on its network, has been making headlines recently for all the right reasons. The digital asset has emerged as one of the top performers in the crypto market in recent months, largely owing to Ripple’s significant legal victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission in July. This victory marked a turning point in the ongoing legal battle that has been unfolding since December 2020. As XRP enthusiasts eagerly anticipate Ripple’s “Proper Party” scheduled for September 29, the crypto’s price remains a point of interest for investors and traders. The community of XRP holders is curious as to whether the company would reveal anything significant regarding the SEC litigation at the party. Currently, XRP is trading comfortably above the critical support level of $0.5, indicating the resilience of its bullish momentum. Related Reading: MakerDAO (MKR) Recent Rally Signals Potential For New Highs – $1,700 On The Horizon? XRP’s Current Price Position As of the latest data from CoinGecko, XRP is valued at $0.508916. While the past 24 hours have seen a minor decline of 0.6%, the cryptocurrency has exhibited a seven-day gain of 1.3%. These figures suggest that XRP remains firmly within the spotlight, even amidst the recent market turbulence caused by the Federal Reserve’s decision to pause the interest rate hike for September. However, it’s not all smooth sailing for XRP. As shown in a recent price analysis, the coin faces a significant hurdle in the form of the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). For more than a month, this EMA has acted as a formidable barrier, thwarting XRP’s attempts to break through to higher price levels. The consistent rejections at this line have solidified its reputation as a formidable resistance zone for XRP. XRP market cap currently at $27 billion. Chart: TradingView.com For XRP bulls, the key focus now is to maintain the critical support level at $0.5. Failure to do so could expose the cryptocurrency to further downside pressure and the risk of a bear flag breakout. In such a scenario, XRP might be compelled to retest the $0.4 and $0.3 price levels, respectively. Anticipating Bullish Momentum If support at $0.5 holds steady and bulls manage to break through the confluence resistance at $0.5239, XRP could be poised for substantial gains. Enthusiasts and investors are eyeing a potential uptrend that could lead XRP to the $0.85 and $1 price levels in the near future. Related Reading: CoinsPaid Perspective: The Main Reason You’re At Risk Of Being Hacked XRP’s recent performance and its legal victory against the SEC have undoubtedly rejuvenated the cryptocurrency’s prospects. While hurdles remain, the XRP community hopes the upcoming celebration and sustained market support will propel the digital asset to new heights in the crypto landscape.

17931110,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552463,1695375035,Investment Firm Founder Has An Important Message For Bitcoin Holders,"SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci recently shared positive views on the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, which could provide some comfort to BTC holders as the bear market lingers. Scaramucci Says HODL Bitcoin According to a report by Business Insider, the investment firm founder advised Bitcoin holders not to sell their BTC as they already made it through the winter. Interestingly, he mentioned that the worst of the bear market is over. Despite this being a bold assertion, there is evidence to suggest that he might be right. Related Reading: Bloomberg Analyst Lauds Bitcoin Energy Shift Amid Rising Hashrate There is the likelihood that Bitcoin has bottomed as the co-founder of Delphi Digital, Kevin Kelly once noted. Following past trends, BTC usually bottoms 18 months before the Bitcoin Halving (with the next coming in April 2024). As such, the worst part of this current market cycle might truly be over. Scaramucci made this known while speaking at the Messari Mainnet conference in New York. He stated that he was still bullish on Bitcoin despite the cryptocurrency trading far below the highs it reached in 2021. Bitcoin peaked at $68,789 in November 2021 but has since declined by about 61%. Meanwhile, he has singled out Wall Street’s adoption of BTC as one of the factors that will drive the cryptocurrency’s mainstream adoption. Wall Street giants, like the biggest asset manager, BlackRock, have applied to offer a Spot Bitcoin ETF, and he believes that once these firms have that in their “arsenal,” the Bitcoin market is going to widen as it is expected that institutional investors will be looking to invest in it. Scaramucci also likened the potential growth of BTC to the Internet boom, as he stated that the younger generation would be “mainstreaming Bitcoin” the same way his generation mainstreamed the Internet (most likely about when there was massive growth in Internet adoption). Factors That Could Affect BTC’s Growth Despite his optimism about Bitcoin’s future, Scaramucci noted certain macro factors that could hamper Bitcoin’s growth. These factors include the higher interest rates, negative sentiment around crypto, and the SEC Chief Gary Gensler with Gensler recently stating that there are so many “hucksters” and “fraudsters” in the crypto space. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts More Trouble Ahead For Bitcoin Price, Here’s Why However, his opinion on the higher interest rates seems to contrast with that of Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten, who stated that the Fed isn’t doing enough (regarding the interest rate hike) to keep inflation down. According to him, re-inflation is on the rise, and this could be one of the factors that could affect Bitcoin’s price going forward.

Calcium (CAL), a so-called dummy token created by the Shiba Inu team as part of a plan to renounce the bone (BONE) token contract, was issued by developers early on Friday. Over 50% of its supply was picked up by a bot shortly after going live as part of a planned move, and these tokens were live on the decentralized exchange (DEX) ShibaSwap.  But traders still purchased the tokens in hopes of making a quick buck, only to end up losing money. Some Shiba Inu community members warned against purchasing the tokens, as they were not intended to be an investable asset.  However, a cohort of community members who claim to have lost money used their CAL token holdings to create a new trading pair on Uniswap – with the token quickly finding over 1,400 holders in less than 12 hours. Participants in this new trading pair said they were “tired of Shiba Inu’s promises,” and intended to make Calcium a real project.  This led to prices of the original CAL token dropping 99% and had an on-chain liquidity of just $4,800 on ShibaSwap. But CAL tokens on the Uniswap DEX racked up $4 million in trading volumes and amassed $164,000 in liquidity.  How Calcium Came Into Play  Shiba Inu developers said in a post last week that they would issue calcium tokens to renounce the contract ownership of bone (BONE), the governance tokens of the newly launched Shibarium blockchain.  In crypto circles, renouncing a smart contract means that the contract's creator will no longer have control over it – giving investors a sense of security as the contract can no longer be changed or updated, and is hence saved from possible manipulation by the contract creator.  “This token is being created only for a specific purpose to mint and renounce BONE,” Shiba Inu developers said. “Please do not trade this token as it will not have any future value or need.”  “If someone is selling this please consider this a scam,” developer Kaal Dhairya wrote at the time.  Crypto project, however, doesn’t need a developer’s endorsement to work. Community members can rally around any token, seed liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and gather outside developers to work on use cases.  “People bought, added lp, and created a TeleGram chat which then turned it into a movement against the $SHIB team because of their recent actions against the community and ecosystem,” @1BlockChainKing, a vocal member of the Calcium token community, tweeted.

17929261,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552449,1695370838,ASO Bullish Cross Reveals Bull Run Start For XRP: Crypto Analyst,"Renowned crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto has unveiled a fresh XRP price prediction, introducing the community to a less-known indicator, the “Average Sentiment Oscillator” or ASO. Commenting on its significance, EGRAG explained on Twitter today: “Exciting ASO Update Alert! Check out the post from September 9th to witness the impressive ascent and curve of the bullish trend! The momentum is ablaze, with an unstoppable surge toward that coveted bullish cross! #XRPArmy, HOLD STEADY! The imminent ASO bullish cross is the spark that will ignite the upcoming XRP bull run!” Here’s When The Next XRP Bull Run Could Start From the chart presented by EGRAG, the convergence of the blue line (representing bulls) and the red line (representing bears) is evident. By demarcating a yellow box on this chart, EGRAG anticipates the bullish crossover to manifest between the conclusion of 2023 and the commencement of the second half of 2024. Historical data reveals that XRP has already undergone this bullish crossover on two prior occasions. The first, in 2017, witnessed a meteoric 55,000% rise in XRP’s price. The subsequent occurrence, spanning late 2020 to April 2021, saw XRP appreciate by a commendable 1500%. EGRAG underscores the magnitude of the current situation by noting the presence of “the largest jaw” ever, leading to speculation that the ensuing XRP rally could dwarf previous ones. Related Reading: XRP Price Poised For A 250% Surge, Analyst Points To This Key Catalyst EGRAG’s September update brought substantial insights, underscoring the notable shift in the ASO and the build-up of undeniable momentum towards the bullish cross. In his words, “there’s an undeniable momentum building towards that coveted bullish cross.” First, EGRAG had outlined the oscillator’s remarkable potential in March, describing it as the harbinger of a monumental bullish setup, showcasing the depth of market volatility and the contrasting strength/weakness of an asset. He emphasized, “The Mother of all #Bullish Set-Ups is upon us,” pointing to the impressive setups building in both the 3 Weeks Time Frame (TF) and Monthly TF. A Deep Dive Into ASO The ASO serves as a momentum oscillator, providing averaged percentages of bull/bear sentiment. This tool is recommended for accurately gauging the sentiment during a specific candle period, aiding in trend filtering or determining entry/exit points. Related Reading: Ripple Stirs Debate By Shuffling $260 Million In XRP: What’s Behind The Move? Conceptualized by Benjamin Joshua Nash and adapted from the MT4 version, the ASO employs two algorithms. While the first algorithm evaluates the bullish/bearish nature of individual bars based on OHLC prices before averaging them, the second assesses the sentiment percentage by considering a group of bars as a single entity. The ASO displays Bulls % with a blue line and Bears % with a red line. The dominance of sentiment is represented by the elevated line. A crossover at the 50% centreline indicates a power shift between bulls and bears, offering potential entry or exit points. This is particularly efficacious when the average volume is significant. Further insights can be derived by observing the strength of trends or swings. For instance, a blue peak surpassing its preceding red one. Any divergence, like a second bullish peak registering reduced strength on the oscillator but ascending in the price chart, is clearly visible. By setting thresholds at the 70% and 30% marks, the oscillator can function similarly to Stochastic or RSI for trading overbought/oversold levels. As with many indicators, a shorter period provides advanced signals while a longer period reduces the likelihood of false alerts. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5097.

42419547,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEs6X,1695369650,"FTX Sues Former Employees of Hong Kong Affiliate, Seeks $157 Million","Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has sued former employees of Salameda, a Hong Kong-incorporated entity affiliated with FTX that it says was controlled by the firm's ex-CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, to recover about $157.3 million, according to a court filing late Thursday.  The filing alleges Michael Burgess, Matthew Burgess, their mother Lesley Burgess, Kevin Nguyen, Darren Wong and two companies owned or controlled several firms that had accounts registered at FTX.com and FTX US, and fraudulently withdrew assets in the days leading up to FTX's bankruptcy.  During the 90 days before the Nov. 11, 2022 bankruptcy filing, known as the Preference Period, the defendants received the benefit of withdrawals that constitute preferential transfers and ""are avoidable under the Bankruptcy Code,"" the filing said. The defendants raced to withdraw assets and exploited their connections to FTX personnel to ensure they would be prioritized over other customers, according to the filing.  This isn't the first time the FTX bankruptcy estate has tried to claw back payments from related parties. It has already targeted Bankman-Fried and his executives, Bankman-Fried’s parents and FTX’s philanthropic and life science arms. It's also trying to reclaim payments made to Genesis Global Capital, which is owned by CoinDesk's parent, Digital Currency Group, and is also bankrupt. In January, a bankruptcy attorney said FTX had recovered more than $5 billion in different assets. In June, the bankruptcy team said the company owed its customers $8.7 billion.  The filing also alleges, citing messages on communications application Slack, that Matthew Burgess enlisted other FTX employees to “push out” certain pending withdrawal requests from one of Michael Burgess' FTX US exchange accounts while misrepresenting the account as his own.  The transfers were completed just hours before FTX halted withdrawals on Nov. 8, 2022. More than $123 million of the total $157.3 million (based on Aug. 31, 2023, pricing) were withdrawn on or after Nov. 7.  The transfers were made ""with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud FTX US’s present or future creditors,"" the filing said.  Bankman-Fried is currently in jail preparing for his trial, scheduled to start on Oct. 3. On Thursday, an appeals court rejected his attempt to get out of jail before the start of the proceedings.

In the next few days, prices may remain steady owing to hedging activity of options market makers or dealers, who are likely to buy low and sell high in the spot market, arresting the price volatility.  A market maker or a dealer is a market participant posting both a bid and ask in a market to provide liquidity at all times. These entities make money from the bid-ask spread and agnostic to price action. They run a direction-neutral (delta neutral) book, which mandates constant buying and selling of the underlying asset to limit the exposure to price gyrations.  ""Dealers predominantly hold long [gamma] positions for the $1,650-$1,700 strikes, both for 22nd and 29th September [expiries],"" Options Insights founder Imran Lakha said in a blog post at Deribit.  ""The magnitude of these positions is consequential enough to influence market dynamics. Consequently, it could constrain Ethereum’s mobility leading up to the 29th September expiry, especially on the bullish side,"" Lakha added.  Gamma refers to the rate of change of delta or sensitive of option's price to changes in the underlying asset. The nature of market makers' hedging activity depends on their gamma exposure.  When market makers and dealers are net long gamma, they keep their overall market exposure neutral by selling high and buying low.  In other words, they are buyers of the underlying asset when the market drops and sellers when the market rallies. That, in turn, adds liquidity to the market and reduces price gyrations. As such, markets often gravitate toward levels where the positive dealer gamma exposure is significant.  The gamma increases significantly as expiry nears, warranting more hedging by dealers with net positive gamma exposure, which further dampens price volatility.

The bank notes that Ethereum's daily transactions count has fallen 12% since the Shanghai upgrade, daily active addresses have dropped nearly 20%, and the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) on the blockchain has slumped almost 8%.  The fall in network activity suggests that the “bearish forces” of the past year, which include the collapse of Terra and FTX, the U.S. regulatory crackdown, and a shrinking stablecoin universe, have potentially outweighed the positive impact from the Shanghai upgrade, the bank said.  While staking has jumped by 50% since the Shanghai upgrade, which helps to improve network security, the “share of liquid staking protocols such as Lido remains uncomfortably high, raising questions about centralization,” the bank added.  The Merge took place in September 2022 and involved transitioning from a more energy-intensive PoW to the PoS consensus mechanism. The Shanghai upgrade took place in April this year and enabled the withdrawal of staked ether (stETH). DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain. TVL is the total value of crypto assets deposited in a DeFi protocol.  There is more hope of a material increase in the Ethereum network activity with the upcoming EIP-4844 upgrade or Protodanksharding, the report added, but “continued bearish crypto forces remain a headwind.”  The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844, or Protodanksharding, is planned for the fourth quarter of this year.

This resurgence has reignited optimism among investors and speculators alike, suggesting that MKR may be poised to explore uncharted territory. One of the pivotal factors driving this remarkable rally is the significant accumulation of MKR tokens by a group of crypto whales. This acquisition, confirmed by on-chain data from Santiment, reflects the growing interest in the cryptocurrency among large holders. Such whale activity is often seen as a bullish signal, suggesting confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. Related Reading: CoinsPaid Perspective: The Main Reason You’re At Risk Of Being Hacked Whale Activity And Its Impact On MakerDao (MKR) Price Evidence of the burgeoning optimism surrounding MKR comes in the form of substantial whale activity. In a recent revelation, Lookonchain disclosed that two prominent crypto whales made a foray into the MKR market in September, injecting millions of dollars into the token. A price report further corroborates this narrative, showcasing a discernible increase in MKR accumulation across the network. 2 whales are accumulating $MKR.

Supply Dynamics And The Road Ahead A separate report resonates with the prevailing bullish sentiment, highlighting an intriguing observation. The supply of MKR tokens held by top addresses has exhibited a gradual uptick since September 6. This intriguing development suggests that the recent price gains witnessed by MKR are more than just a fleeting phenomenon and may indeed have the potential for longevity. MKR market cap currently at $1.2 billion. Chart: TradingView.com MKR Sustains Weekly Advance As of the latest data from CoinGecko, MKR is currently priced at $1,294, marking a 3.7% decline over the past 24 hours but still maintaining a seven-day surge of 9.1%. These price movements underscore the cryptocurrency’s recent resilience, giving investors optimism the token can hit the vaunted $1,700 target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enjoys Growing Favorable Conditions, Top Analyst Says Maker DAO’s MKR token has experienced a remarkable resurgence, driven in part by the accumulation of tokens by influential crypto whales. The bullish sentiment has sparked hopes of new all-time highs, but caution is advised, as weak buying volume could jeopardize the sustainability of the rally. As MKR continues its journey, investors and traders will keenly watch for signs of genuine demand to ascertain the token’s true potential in the weeks to come.

Before this price gain, IMX had been relatively stable all week, hovering around the $0.52 price zone, according to data from Coingecko. Behind IMX’s Rise, Analysts Points To Price Manipulation Although there may be no clear reasons for the token’s positive price movement, Chinese reporter Colin Wu speculated about potential price speculation. According to a post on X by Wu, 10.95 million of the token, valued at $8.1 million, were transferred to the Upbit exchange from several other crypto exchanges, including Binance, OKX, Bybit, Crypto.com, Gate, etc. Following these transactions, the token surged from $0.56 to $0.74, representing a 34.5% price gain. Wu has stated that Korean traders are “behind this move.” The Upbit exchange is mainly popular in South Korea, dominating over 83% of the nation’s crypto market. Providing more insight into these transactions, on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain reports that these transfers to Upbit were sent to the same wallet with the address “0x2F77.” This indicates a single crypto whale was likely behind this price surge. Related Reading: IMX Spikes 10% In Last 24 Hours – Will It Start The Week Strong? Within three hours on Thursday, 12.54 million of the token, valued at $9.45 million, was transferred to “0x2F77,” allowing this address to become the 9th largest holder of the token, owning 20.4 million worth $15 million. Furthermore, Lookonchain also revealed that several IMX investors opted to take profit following the token’s price gain. These investors include GSR Markets, a crypto investment firm that moved 2 million IMX, worth $1.52 million, to Binance right after IMX rose. In addition, three investors withdrew 3.5 million IMX, valued at $2.3 million, from the Foundation Treasury Locked wallet and may be planning a market dump. Following such transactions, it is no surprise that IMX soon experienced a price decline of about 13.33% a few hours after its boost.

17919066,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552413,1695348016,Celo Considers Transitioning To Ethereum Layer-2 With Polygon Chain,"Celo, a blockchain platform, is exploring migrating from its standalone blockchain to an Ethereum (ETH) Layer-2 (L2) network. Originally, Celo had planned to utilize Optimism’s OP Stack, a customizable toolkit similar to Polygon (MATIC) but based on Optimism’s technology. However, Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon Labs, has proposed an alternative solution to the Celo community. Nailwal suggests leveraging Polygon’s Chain Development Kit (CDK), an open-source toolset that enables the creation of customizable Layer-2 chains powered by zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. Celo’s Potential Move To Ethereum Layer-2 Via Polygon In a recent blog post, Polygon Labs suggested Celo could consider deploying an Ethereum Layer-2 solution using Polygon CDK. According to Polygon Labs co-founder Nailwal, this strategy would allow Celo to leverage the benefits of being an Ethereum Layer-2 platform while preserving the characteristics that have contributed to its success. Related Reading: Why Touching This Bitcoin Level Could Hold The Key For A Rally The proposal emphasizes several key advantages of adopting Polygon CDK. Firstly, it enables cross-community collaboration by integrating with an ecosystem of Layer-2 solutions powered by zero-knowledge technology. Polygon CDK enhances compatibility with Ethereum by providing an environment equivalent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This alignment ensures a seamless transition for Celo, closely matching Ethereum’s technical infrastructure and tooling. Furthermore, according to Nailwal, deploying with the protocol’s CDK offers increased security for Celo. It allows Celo to leverage Ethereum’s proven consensus layer while incorporating the security benefits of zero-knowledge proofs. Regarding fees and scalability, Celo can benefit from low fees by utilizing the zkEVM validium architecture and off-chain data availability supported by Polygon CDK. These features contribute to cost-efficient transactions while enabling scalability for Celo’s network. Moreover, according to Nailwal, Celo gains access to a unified Layer-2 economy by becoming a part of the Polygon ecosystem by combining Ethereum’s mainnet with Polygon’s ecosystem. This integration creates a seamless experience for developers and users, facilitating interaction with both networks. Fast Transactions And Lower Fees? With zero-knowledge technology, Celo users can enjoy near-instant withdrawals, faster finality times, and instant cross-chain interactivity. According to the blog post, these features enhance the speed, efficiency, and security of transactions, ultimately improving the user experience. Through Polygon CDK, chains can achieve near-instant cross-chain interactivity with Ethereum, leveraging the power of ZK proofs to establish a secure and interconnected network. Related Reading: Binance & Deribit Traders Aggressively Short Bitcoin, Squeeze Incoming? Overall, the proposed migration to Polygon CDK represents an opportunity for Celo to transition to an Ethereum Layer-2 solution while harnessing the advantages offered by Polygon’s ZK-powered technology. The proposal aims to initiate discussions between the Celo and Polygon communities to explore the potential benefits for all stakeholders involved. It is important to note that no final decision has been made at this stage, and the proposal signifies the beginning of discussions between the Celo and Polygon communities.

However, on-chain data shows that a crypto whale, “0xb154”, has moved more coins from Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, to a non-custodial wallet. On September 21, the ETH whale transferred over $8.1 million of the coin. Whale Moves More Ethereum From Binance, Buying NFTs When crypto prices contract, outflows from non-custodial wallets to centralized ramps, including Binance and Coinbase, tend to rise. This is because centralized exchanges supporting stablecoins or fiat, including the Euro or JPY, offer an interface where they can easily swap for the “safety” of the less volatile fiat currencies or tokens designed to mirror them, including USDT. Related Reading: Binance & Deribit Traders Aggressively Short Bitcoin, Squeeze Incoming? That the holder is shifting tokens away from Binance regardless of the heightened volatility can signal confidence for ETH and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. It is not immediately clear what could have motivated the whale to move coins away from the exchange at this point. However, what’s evident is that ETH is down roughly 4% from September 21’s peak and moving further away from April 2023 highs when it rose to over $2,100. Records show this is not the first time the whale moved funds. On September 6, the investor withdrew 9,688 ETH worth $15.8 million from Binance. Less than two weeks earlier, the whale notably transferred 22,340 ETH, worth $41.2 million, to Binance.

Apart from simply HODLing ETH, the whale has also been active on the non-fungible token (NFT) scene, looking at historical purchases. Over time, the investor has held over 100 NFTs where, on average, spent 0.2641 ETH; the latest purchase was on September 21. The investor has been actively accumulating NFTs since early April 2023 and has spent over 35 ETH. ETH And NFTs Are Fragile The whale has accumulated more ETH and NFTs when the crypto market is fragile. To illustrate, NFT trading volume is over 90% down from 2021 peaks. Presently, ETH prices are down 25% from April 2023 peaks. When writing, bears have successfully forced the coin below June 2023 lows as the coin moves further away from the psychological $2,000 level.

The SEC sued Binance, Zhao and Binance.US in June, alleging they illegally listed unregistered securities in the form of several cryptocurrencies for trading and investment by U.S. investors. The suit immediately kicked off a legal fight over just who could access Binance.US customer funds. In Thursday's filings, attorneys for Binance and Binance.US said the regulator was overreaching by alleging violations of securities law.  ""The SEC recently brought several enforcement actions – including this action – premised on its new position that virtually all crypto assets, and virtually all cryptoasset transactions, are securities,"" one of the filings said.  The agency was defining the term ""investment contract"" too broadly, one of the filings said.  Both filings also raised similar arguments over the so-called ""major questions doctrine,"" a Supreme Court ruling that directed federal agencies to await Congressional authority over significant economic or political issues.  ""Indeed, since 2019, Congress has considered more than a dozen proposals that would provide a coherent and workable framework for crypto assets and their trading platforms,"" the filing said. ""Critically, none of those proposals would confer sole regulatory jurisdiction over the crypto industry to the SEC. Despite this, the SEC now seeks to expand its authority and filed this lawsuit, asserting claims against Binance Holdings Limited ('BHL') and Changpeng Zhao, among others.""  The argument has proven divisive in court, with some judges ruling that Congress needs to clarify the regulatory treatment of digital assets and others ruling that crypto was not nearly significant enough to meet the doctrine.

17915953,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552377,1695340849,This Binance Wallet Triggered A Temporary 30X Surge In Ethereum Gas Fees,"A cryptocurrency wallet associated with the prominent trading platform, Binance, has seen massive activity in the last 24 hours, leading to abnormally high transaction fees on the Ethereum network. Binance Wallet Incurs Nearly $850,000 Gas Fees In One Day A crypto wallet labeled “Binance 14” witnessed a significant transaction surge on September 21, rising above 140,000. As a result of this activity surge, transactions of the Binance-owned wallet consistently incurred gas fees of over 300 gwei, even though the network’s average fee was around 10 gwei. This gas fee jump and significant wallet activity have resulted in around 530 ETH (equivalent to nearly $850,000) in gas used on the Binance 14 address today. Related Reading: Binance & Deribit Traders Aggressively Short Bitcoin, Squeeze Incoming? The increase in transactions on the Binance wallet had a broader, albeit temporary, impact on the Ethereum network. Gas fees on the blockchain momentarily jumped from less than 10 gwei to above 330 gwei per transaction, according to blockchain data tracker Etherscan. Gas fees refer to the cost blockchain users incur or pay validators to conduct transactions or execute contracts on the Ethereum network. Fees depend on the blockchain’s demand and supply of processing power. This means when a network has many transactions, there is often a high demand for processing power, which increases gas fees. Possible Reasons For The Gas Fee Spike In the wake of this incident, Wu Blockchain reported that Binance said it was carrying out its wallet aggregation process when the gas fees were low to facilitate withdrawals and ensure the safety of user funds. Nonetheless, some prominent crypto community members have weighed in on the situation, offering possible explanations for the gas fee spike. Martin Koppelmann, cofounder of the Gnosis chain, said on the X (formerly Twitter) platform that Binance might be using a “really inefficient script” to consolidate, leading to high transaction costs. Blockchain analysts at Scopescan gave a similar prognosis on the gas incident. The on-chain analytics platform said: Due to Binance consolidating funds from long-inactive deposit addresses, the Ethereum network is experiencing congestion, causing Gas fees to surge to 300 gwei. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Signal Reappears After Five Years To Threaten ETH’s Price Adam Cochran, a popular crypto investor, suggested that the abnormally high transaction fees might have been due to Binance’s subpar APIs. In his X post, Cochran criticized the exchange’s technological infrastructure while casting doubts on its capacity to safe-keep “hundreds of billions in coins across multiple protocols.” According to CoinGecko data, the price of Ethereum currently sits below $1,600, reflecting a 2.8% decline in the past 24 hours.
