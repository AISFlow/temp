42385753,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBO6hB,1611615448,Senate Confirms Janet Yellen as US Treasury Secretary,"Janet Yellen is the 78th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.      The former Federal Reserve chair and longtime economist secured enough votes in the Senate on Monday after a confirmation hearing on Jan. 19. Yellen was tapped by President Joe Biden to lead the Treasury Department after winning election last year. She succeeds Steven Mnuchin, who left office on Wednesday following Biden’s inauguration.      The newly minted Cabinet official hasn’t spoken much on crypto. During her term leading the Federal Reserve Board, she indicated she wasn't a huge fan of bitcoin but called for light regulation.      Yellen joins a Treasury Department overseeing a host of crypto-related proposed rules as well implementing President Biden’s response to an economic crisis brought about by the year-long global coronavirus pandemic. During her confirmation hearing she called for “big” relief from the government to support U.S. residents.      “Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country’s debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big,” she said in her opening remarks, before Biden was sworn in as president. “In the long run, I believe the benefits will far outweigh the costs, especially if we care about helping people who have been struggling for a very long time.”      Yellen did not address the risk of heightened inflation during the hearing, though she said maintaining the stability of the U.S. financial system would be beneficial for both the U.S. and other nations.      Though inflation in the U.S. has been below 2% in the past few years, economists are watching the amount of debt the nation racks up in addressing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.    Active issues    Yellen will oversee the finalization and implementation, or possible modification, of a host of proposed rules, largely centered around FinCEN, that could directly impact the crypto industry.      The most controversial is a proposed reporting rule spearheaded by former Secretary Mnuchin, which would require exchanges to record counterparty information from transactions to unhosted wallets, as well as have exchanges file currency transaction reports for transactions in excess of $10,000 per day.      ""I am aware of the rules proposed by FinCEN in December 2020 regarding how certain digital assets are treated under the Bank Secrecy Act,"" she wrote in response to a Senate Finance Committee question on the proposal. ""I agree on the need to ensure adequate consultation with and input from stakeholders. If confirmed, I intend to ensure a full and substantive review of the proposals, which will include an assessment of how to ensure proper input from stakeholders.""      The comment period for the rule – originally just 15 days – was extended earlier this month, with different aspects receiving different extensions.      The industry has an additional 15 days to respond to the CTR requirement, which FinCEN said matched existing rules for cash transactions.      However, industry participants are getting 45 more days to respond to the counterparty requirement, which participants already say is far more difficult to comply with. FinCEN said the extended deadline is due to the complexity of the issue.      Read more: The Relationship Between US Government Debt and Bitcoin, Explained      Other proposed rules being considered by FinCEN include a thresholds rule, which would require banks to collect and store fund transfer information for transactions of more than $250 leaving or entering the U.S., whether in fiat or crypto.      This is far less than the current limit of at least $3,000. A public comment period for the proposal has already closed.      At the end of 2020 FinCEN also announced it would require foreign bank account holders to report cryptocurrency holdings in excess of $10,000, bringing an offshore reporting rule that already applies to fiat into the crypto space.      The status of these rules is unclear.      On the domestic banking front, the OCC finalized a rule that prohibited banks from not lending to specific industries, a move that seemed primarily aimed at the firearms and energy sectors but which the crypto industry saw as beneficial. However, this rule was not sent to the Federal Register before Biden took office, and one of his first acts was to freeze all rules from being implemented until his team can review them.      It seems unlikely this rule will be implemented.    ‘Particular concern’    Yellen didn’t provide much of a window into how she might approach the question of regulating cryptocurrencies during her testimony or in written remarks sent to the Senate Finance Committee after the hearing.      She called cryptocurrency use in terrorist financing “a particular concern” during the hearing in response to a question by Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.).      “We need to make sure that our methods for dealing with these matters, with tech terrorist financing, change along with changing technology,” she said. “I think many [cryptocurrencies] are used, at least in a transactions sense, mainly for illicit financing and I think we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail their use.”      However, she also said that legitimate uses should be encouraged, and said cryptocurrencies have the potential to “improve the efficiency of the financial system.”      She intends to work with the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).      Read more: State of Crypto: What the Crypto World Should Watch for in the Biden Era      While FinCEN seems set to continue operating under the leadership of Director Kenneth Blanco, who took office in 2017, the other agencies are currently operating under acting heads while Biden’s nominees wait for their confirmation hearings.      Former CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler has been nominated to chair the SEC, which is currently being overseen by Commissioner Allison Herren Lee. The CFTC is being overseen by Commissioner Rostin Behnam, with Georgetown University Law Professor Chris Brummer rumored to be Biden’s choice to chair the agency. Biden will also reportedly tap former U.S. Treasury official and University of Michigan Ford School of Policy Dean Michael Barr to run the OCC, which is being overseen at the moment by Blake Paulson.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/25/senate-confirms-janet-yellen-as-us-treasury-secretary,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34225f045e673e7a5a8d29deb709f511f7ab1f98-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385748,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBO6at,1611612562,"More Institutional Investors Are Buying Ether, Seeing It as a Store of Value","Ether's latest rally to all-time highs appears to be driven, in part, by the sort of institutional investors who piled into bitcoin in 2020 for its digital gold narrative.      More institutional investors are seeing ether as a store of value, according to Coinbase’s annual review for 2020. The crypto exchange noticed “a growing number” of its institutional clients have taken positions in ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network, for its strong returns. These clients predominantly bought bitcoin in 2020.      “The case for owning ethereum [ether] we hear most frequently from our clients is a combination of, first, its evolving potential as a store of value and, second, its status as a digital commodity that is required to power transactions on its network,” according to the report.      As industry leaders including Coinbase and Gemini continue to take a bullish view of ether, an increasing number of large investors are also exploring the sub-sector called decentralized finance (DeFi), according to analysts and traders.      “I think the more adventurous institutions are exploring ethereum and DeFi after they looked at bitcoin,” Arthur Cheong, founder and portfolio manager at DeFi-focused crypto fund DeFiance Capital, told CoinDesk.      “Just like taking part in MicroStrategy’s $650 million convertible senior note offering last year was basically getting an almost-free call option on bitcoin, going long on ethereum is a way to get indirect exposure to DeFi protocols,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital asset prime broker Bequant, said. “Not everyone is comfortable with the risks that are still associated with DeFi, but the hyper growth of these projects boosts activity on the Ethereum network and, thus, supports capital appreciation.”      Adding to the thesis that institutional investors are growing more interested in ether, the CME announced in December it will launch ether futures contracts next month. An ether-based derivatives products on one of the world's largest regulated futures exchanges catering to an institutional crowd will give customers an opportunity to hedge their spot positions, reduce their overall risk of investing in ether and provide a venue for them to take speculative positions.      Read More: Big Investors Stacked Up Ether as Price Rose to Record High      CME’s new ether futures contracts could also be one reason behind the drop on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust’s premium to the underlying value. The price gap recently slipped to a record low, according to data from on-chain data site Skew.      ""The launch of CME futures will allow the institutional crowd to structure basis plays to those that have been so prevalent with bitcoin,” Vinokourov said. “This competition, together with the fact that a digital assets-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) appears more plausible, given the growing institutional appetite, may also continue to suppress premiums on Grayscale products.""      Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.      While there's much evidence that large ether investors have been accumulating ether and helping to push the cryptocurrency to its new all-time high this week, analysts and traders who spoke to CoinDesk largely attribute the rally to renewed demand from crypto natives.      “The ether rally is more organic, and driven more from within the crypto industry than the bitcoin move over the past several months,” Chad Steinglass, head of trading at crypto trading platform CrossTower, told CoinDesk. “There are many crypto specific traders that are looking at the ether/bitcoin ratio and are moving allocations from bitcoin to ether as bitcoin has cooled off recently.”      Ethereum 2.0 staking is another factor that has driven these crypto natives’ appetite to hold ether because of the rewards they gain in the form of annualized interest on their holdings.      Although declining to specify whether the Ethereum 2.0 staking is driven by retail or institutional clients, Kraken's director of banking and payments, Johannes Schmitt, told CoinDesk that more than 380,000 ether have been deposited by the crypto exchange's clients since December, which reflects “a growing awareness in the unique utility underpinning” ether, he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/25/more-institutional-investors-are-buying-ether-seeing-it-as-a-store-of-value,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b119fde813835a73b12fcb4cb0e3a811abe61149-1500x1021.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The state reopened applications for Digital Currency Innovation Lab (DCIL) hopefuls on Monday, raising the possibility that yet more crypto exchanges and service providers could soon do business in the historically restrictive-to-crypto islands.      State law requires crypto companies maintain cash reserves equivalent to their digital currency holdings, an unreachable bar for even the largest exchanges.

Meanwhile, ether’s spot market is decoupling from bitcoin and gyrating wildly, according to volatility metrics.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $32,963 as of 21:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET). Gaining 3.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $31,650-$34,893 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin made gains opening the week, rallying from as low as $31,640 at around 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET) Sunday to as high as $34,893 at around 14:00 UTC (9 a.m. ET) Monday. The price has slipped a bit since then, with the world’s oldest cryptocurrency changing hands around $32,963 as of press time.      “A clean break above $34,500 and more sustainably above $36,000 is needed,” David Lifchitz, chief investment officer of quant trading firm ExoAlpha, told CoinDesk. “We could also be in for a classic 'W' bottom when the first bounce off the lows is met by another batch of selling before it eventually bounces back for real.”      So far this year, bitcoin is up over 13% on spot exchanges such as Luxembourg-based Bitstamp.      “Everyone is seeing good buying at the low end of the $30,000s, so clearly the institutions are comfortable entering there,” noted Chris Thomas, head of digital asset for Swissquote Bank. “We’ve previously seen strong selling around $40,000 so these will be the big tests over the next week or two.”      Read More: Crypto Miner Marathon Patent Group Buys $150M in Bitcoin      “I’d imagine there are a few big names we don’t yet know of currently buying up bitcoin,” Thomas added. “We’ll likely discover them very soon, by which point they will have accumulated quite substantial volumes.”      On the perpetual swaps market, where liquidity providers put up crypto for traders to leverage, funding rates are trending back up, particularly on OKEx, which is offering 0.0865%, its highest since Jan. 20. This is a signal leveraged traders are willing to start paying up to position themselves long.      In the options market, a bullish bitcoin mentality appears to be forming. Open interest (OI) by strikes is highest at the $52,000 price point as of Sunday, with 21.4 BTC in OI. Second place is much more bearish, however, with 17.7 BTC piled up at the $20,000 spot level.      “I think both bitcoin and ether will continue to see higher highs,” said Michael Gord, chief executive officer trading firm Global Digital Assets. “But as we saw in the previous bull run when bitcoin cools off, the spotlight moves to ether and when BTC & ETH are cooled down, we start to see altcoins shine,” Gord added. “That’s what I expect to see the next couple weeks.”      Something to watch: Ether’s decoupling from bitcoin. Over the past year, the correlation between bitcoin and ether has slipped.      On Jan. 24, 2020, the 90-day correlation was at 0.86. A 90-day correlation of 1 means highly correlated.

The pace of donations accelerated last week, after Navalny was arrested in Moscow and his team published an investigative report describing an over-the-top, luxurious, 168-acre estate with a palace that presumably belongs to Putin.      Later, Putin denied he owned the property during a conference call with Russian students on Jan. 25, saying it neither belonged to him nor to his ""close relatives."" (According to the investigation, the estate is owned and managed by companies affiliated with Putin's inner circle).      Bitcoin donations are not widespread in Russia, with only a handful of nonprofits raising money in crypto. Among them, Navalny's fundraising campaign appears to be the most efficient, but even in that case bitcoin accounts for no more than 10% to 15% of all donations.      In the week since Navalny's arrest, his wallet received almost 3.7 BTC, worth about $119,600 at press time, which is nearly three times as much as for the first two weeks of January. It's also much more than the amount of donations the wallet received over the entire year of 2020, crypto news outlet Protos calculated.      ""Both bitcoin and fiat donations spiked after the investigation release and [Navalny's] arrest, and the share of bitcoin grew a bit because of a couple [of] large donations,"" said Leonid Volkov, who is coordinating the work of Navalny's volunteer network across Russia. One of these larger donations, according to Volkov, of one full bitcoin, came from Evgeny Chichvarkin, a Russian millionaire in exile and Navalny's friend. Chichvarkin hadn't returned CoinDesk requests for comment by press time.      Tens of thousands of Russians have taken to the streets to protest Navalny's arrest in what has become the biggest protest rally in the country in almost a decade. Over 3,000 people have been detained as of Saturday, Jan. 23.      Under current Russian law, all street rallies must be sanctioned by the authorities; as a result, almost none are ever authorized. In recent years, a number of protesters were detained and imprisoned for conducting peaceful protests, which deterred many Russians from participating in such activities until the Jan. 23 rallies.    Tough homecoming    The support for Navalny, as well as the public outrage about his treatment by the Russian authorities, has been rising since he got back from Germany, where he spent several months recovering after being poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent, Novichok.      Soon after he woke from a medically induced coma in the Charite clinic in Berlin, Navalny's team, together with Bellingcat and CNN, published an investigation naming the Russia's FSB (secret service) officers who allegedly arranged the poisoning.      Read also: Bitcoin Dissidents: Those Who Need It Most      Navalny also announced he would return to Russia after his recovery. Russia's prison oversight agency then demanded that Navalny's parole be revoked and he be sent to prison on a 2015 criminal case that was overturned by the European Court of Human Rights in 2017.      On his trip back to Moscow, Navalny was followed by multiple news outlets broadcasting his journey minute by minute, as the plane left Berlin and headed to Moscow on Sunday, Jan. 17. After landing in the Sheremetyevo airport, Navalny got to the passport control area and was arrested there. After a court hearing, arranged inside a police station with no independent journalists allowed in, Navalny called for street protests.      Navalny was sentenced to 30 days in jail. Volkov announced new protest rallies will be held on Jan. 31 and Feb. 2.

42385752,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBO6fv,1611610444,"Harvard, Yale, Brown Endowments Have Been Buying Bitcoin for at Least a Year: Sources","Some of the largest university endowment funds in the U.S. have been quietly buying cryptocurrency for the past year or so through accounts held at Coinbase and other exchanges, CoinDesk has learned.      According to two sources familiar with the situation, Harvard, Yale, Brown and the University of Michigan as well as several other colleges have been buying crypto directly on exchanges. (Several Ivy League endowments took an interest in blockchain technology via crypto-focused venture capital funds back in 2018.)      “There are quite a few,” said a source who asked to remain unnamed. “A lot of endowments are allocating a little bit to crypto at the moment.”      Yale and Brown did not respond to requests for comment by press time. When reached by CoinDesk, the Harvard and University of Michigan endowments declined to comment. Coinbase also declined to comment. University endowments got a single mention in Coinbase’s annual report for 2020, but without naming any names.      Some of the university endowment funds in question may have held accounts with Coinbase for as long as 18 months, according to one source.      “It could be since mid-2019,” the source said. “Most have been in at least a year. I would think they will probably discuss it publicly at some point this year. I suspect they would be sitting on some pretty nice chunks of return.”      University endowments are pools of capital accumulated by academic institutions, often in the form of charitable donations. These funds, which support teaching and research, can be allocated into various assets for investment purposes.      Harvard's is the largest university endowment with over $40 billion in assets. Yale has over $30 billion, Michigan has about $12.5 billion, while Brown holds $4.7 billion. It is unknown how much each fund has allocated in crypto but it is likely a fraction of percent of their total assets.    Long road    Back in 2018, Yale University Chief Investment Officer David Swensen made headlines by backing two crypto-focused venture funds, one run by Andreessen Horowitz and another launched by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang.      Several other universities followed Yale in backing crypto VCs, including Harvard, Stanford, Dartmouth College, MIT, University of North Carolina and Michigan. Clearly, some of those schools appear to be taking the next step by investing directly in crypto assets.      The second source, who is involved in the crypto hedge fund world, pointed to “a big change” over the past few months. “We are seeing defined benefit pension plans getting close to making allocations. We are seeing public pension plans getting close to making allocations,” the person said.      “If I had heard that three years ago, I would have said it was wrong,” said Ari Paul, co-founder of BlockTower Capital and previously an investment manager for the University of Chicago. “But a lot of institutions are now comfortable with bitcoin. They understand it and can just buy it directly, as long as it's from a regulated entity like Coinbase, Fidelity or Anchorage.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/25/harvard-yale-brown-endowments-have-been-buying-bitcoin-for-at-least-a-year-sources,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7b6d4fbf7ad726e05027633f154b5800e5c9876-1500x939.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385768,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBO6wH,1611606886,Substack Newsletters Are Being Used to Spread Crypto Scams,"When it comes to the “next big thing” for independent platforms, the newsletter platform Substack has been at the forefront of the charge. The company has lured big-name independent writers such as Casey Newton and Glenn Greenwald to the platform to start their own newsletters.      Substack is now also being leveraged for its ease of use and reach by scammers to impersonate various cryptocurrency projects, encouraging those it reaches to “upgrade their smart contracts” and send funds to a proxy contract ID.      The language across multiple newsletter emails was similar, just plugging in and playing with different project names, suggesting they had a similar origin.    Scam Substack newsletter impersonates Gnosis    For a scam newsletter impersonating the project Gnosis, the dek of the newsletter reads, “The upgraded smart contract uses 71% less gas, supports updates thanks to proxy patterns and allows you to participate in future votes.” While the newsletter said no immediate action was needed, “GNO holders who update early will be eligible for the new liquidity rewards program, starting on January 20th and lasting one week.”      The Gnosis Twitter account tweeted that the newsletter was fraudulent. In the tweet, the Gnosis account told users not to interact with this Substack account, share their wallet address or send any funds.    Read more: This Elusive Malware Has Been Targeting Crypto Wallets for a Year    “Gnosis was alerted to the phishing attempt on Substack via Twitter, as we were one of many popular blockchain projects targeted,” said Gnosis Director of Strategy Kei Kreutler in a direct message. “We immediately contacted Substack and they took down the fraudulent account.”      When CoinDesk reached out to Substack regarding the account on Jan. 15, it noted the account was taken down but did not respond to questions regarding what preventive measures are in place for these types of situations.      “We have permanently removed this account from the platform and any subscribers will no longer have access to the fraudulent Substack site,” the support team said.      Gnosis has now reclaimed gnosis.substack.com and created its own Substack account to prevent against future impersonation attempts.    Other projects affected    Gnosis wasn’t the only project where this happened.      Projects such as RenProject, Kyber Network, Synthetix, Quant, UMA “and probably more,” were also victims, according to cybersecurity researcher Avigayil Mechtinger of the firm Intezer.      “This together with sending emails to relevant users is a whole infrastructure of its own and [the newsletters] used the same scam contract id - 0x093fAd33c3Ff3534428Fd18126235E1e44fA0d19.”    Read more: New to Bitcoin? Stay Safe and Avoid These Common Scams    The scam impersonating Gnosis has already been seemingly successful to some extent though, with at least one responder to the Gnosis tweet admitting to being a victim and sending tokens to this proxy. Another expressed surprise that Gnosis wasn’t the one sending these emails after receiving one.      “We look forward to [Web 3.0] account tools becoming integral for providing trusted, unique and authenticated identity on the web so that such issues on other platforms arise less in the future,” said Kreutler. “This is why we built the Gnosis Safe, and we hope to see platforms like Substack beginning to adopt Web 3.0 technologies.”    Email phishing    Imitating emails so they look like they are coming from a legitimate source is a common practice, with the overall goal being for users to open them and give up information or money. Indeed, CoinDesk readers have been victimized by scammers sending out emails impersonating us.      The Substack scam is a logical extension of this method, with the goal of reaching a large group of people with seemingly legitimate material. Scammers are often looking for new and convincing ways to target individuals. While people might pass over a classic “Nigerian prince” scam email, they may let their guard down when it comes to legitimate-looking emails from a popular newsletter site.      With a limited number of moderators and Substack’s hands-off approach, it will likely be up to readers to keep an eye out for scams like these when they arise.

42385760,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBO6pz,1611606125,We Have Entered the Age of Anonymous Crypto,"Recently, following a change to Whatsapp’s privacy policy, hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world left for other services. Signal, an encrypted messenger service, saw so many sign-ups that it temporarily crashed.      This was followed by a mass exodus from social media, as Twitter and Facebook became embroiled in a debate on free speech and censorship, a chain of events that may signal a shift in how users value privacy.    Rachel-Rose O'Leary is a coder and writer at Dark Renaissance Technologies. She was a tech writer for CoinDesk from 2017 to 2018, covering privacy tech and Ethereum. She has a background in digital art and philosophy, and has been writing about crypto since 2015. The views expressed in this article are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the publication.    Riccardo Spangi or ""fluffypony,” the former lead maintainer of privacy-centric cryptocurrency monero, called this a ""watershed moment"" for privacy. ""People are realizing that you don’t get privacy just handed to you. You have to stand up and take it,"" he told CoinDesk.      For years, topics including anonymity, censorship resistance and decentralization were the purview of political extremists. Armed with a pessimistic, even paranoid outlook, the forefathers of cryptocurrency engineered tools, like Bitcoin, for a world where civilization had fallen.      But now, spurred on by an information crisis and compounding global unrest, privacy has entered popular consciousness.      As on the popular consumer-facing apps such as Signal, activity on the encrypted anonymous internet, the darknet, is on the rise. While it’s hard to estimate usage due to its anonymity benefits, Tor Browser was downloaded 10% more on average this January than last year. In the past 12 months, the number of hidden websites has increased 180%.      This rising popularity could be driving an increase in monero transactions. In December, darknet market Whitehouse reportedly announced it would no longer accept bitcoin payments, strengthening monero’s foothold as the cryptocurrency of choice for the darknet.      See also: Steven Waterhouse – The Pandemic Turbocharged Online Privacy Concerns      In fact, despite being delisted from exchanges Shapeshift and Bittrex, monero’s price has steadily grown 140% in the past year, while its daily transactions have increased by a staggering 290%. Zcash has likewise increased nearly 70% in price.      All of this is to say there’s a growing demand for privacy. What’s more, the privacy scene has never been more prepared for an influx of users.    A new dawn    Privacy has always been a core value of the crypto-anarchist philosophy. Bitcoin itself was designed to be pseudonymous, but its privacy-protecting features are insufficient to protect users from blockchain analysis.      In the past 10 years, fully anonymous cryptocurrency has emerged as a Holy Grail of blockchain research. Millions in research dollars have been committed, though until recently no purely private cryptos emerged without substantial trade-offs to scalability and decentralization.      Several small, incremental achievements are beginning to come to fruition. Litecoin is testing a potential privacy upgrade, Mimblewimble. Privacy coin Firo, previously named Zcoin, is pioneering new cryptographic research with its recent release of Lelantus.      Meanwhile, earlier this month, Zcash announced its plan to implement Halo 2, a groundbreaking upgrade that will allow the cryptocurrency to add new assets to its base layer, such as an anonymous stablecoin or wrapped versions of other cryptocurrencies – while Monero is also building toward a multi-chain paradigm, specifically with privacy implications for Bitcoin through atomic swaps.      Further, while Monero's ring signatures reduce its anonymity, a new upgrade called TRIPTYCH will make this privacy leakage less of a concern.      Bitcoin, too, will see privacy-protecting enhancements with the long-anticipated rollout of its Taproot upgrade. When activated, Taproot will allow smart contracts written in the Bitcoin scripting language to appear like normal transactions, so more complex code can populate the blockchain undetected.      It's not just traditional cryptocurrencies that are undergoing a renaissance. Privacy apps are proliferating on decentralized finance (DeFi) while private smart contract platforms like Secret Network and Aleo are enabling general purpose, programmable privacy.    Can the state withstand a full-blown Bitcoin offensive?    All of these advancements are made possible by significant improvements in privacy tech, especially zero-knowledge cryptography. Having authored the first privacy-oriented Bitcoin wallet in 2013, Amir Taaki has been working on anonymity tech in crypto for nearly 10 years.      ""Zero-knowledge is probably the biggest breakthrough in cryptocurrency since the invention of Bitcoin itself. It enables an entire new class of privacy applications that previously couldn't exist before,"" he said.    The darkening    Advances in privacy tech have the potential to revolutionize not just cryptocurrency, but all aspects of how we interact with the web. The internet is currently dominated by data harvesting and surveillance. In exchange for using a service, user data is collected by companies for increasingly surreal purposes, such as behavior prediction and control.      By offering a new economic vision for technology, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has the potential to challenge this paradigm. Mixnet provider Nym Technologies is working in this direction, offering privacy-friendly applications the ability to monetize their services.      Still, these new vistas will not be without their challenges. For the last year, crypto has been awash with rumors and headlines foretelling an impending regulatory crackdown.      In an interview that coincided with her statement that the European Central Bank (ECB) will release its own digital currency – the digital euro – within the next five years, ECB President Christine Lagarde called for global bitcoin regulation. Separately, U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen said that cryptocurrencies are a “particular concern” for terrorism financing, and stated the need to “curtail their use.”      Both the U.S. and European Union – formerly a privacy stronghold – have also floated rules that threaten end-to-end encryption and privately held crypto addresses.      See also: Proposed Crypto Wallet Rule Among Those Frozen by Biden Pending Review      If there was ever a need for strong, unhackable, privacy-preserving tools to be built, it’s now.    Worst-case scenario    Regulatory pressure may have an unintended consequence by making privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies more attractive. In a scenario where crypto is banned, crypto will merely go underground, where it had its beginnings.      A nightmare scenario for an industry overrun by bankers, such a grim regulatory outlook is widely dismissed as FUD. Not only would this cripple the emerging cryptocurrency ecosystem financially, but it would severely damage its core value propositions: openness, accessibility, being permissionless.      Still, perhaps in anticipation of regulatory crackdowns, Bitcoiners are adopting an increasingly militant rhetoric. Rumors of an impending ""privacy war"" have been circulating on Twitter, with cryptocurrency advocates volunteering themselves for the front line.      According to Taaki, such a confrontation is effectively preprogrammed.      ""I don't see a resolution between an emerging cryptocurrency industry and the state-backed fiat system,"" he said, ""These things are [at] loggerheads, and using anonymity to shield participants in a network is of vital importance to our success as a movement.""      See also: Michael Casey – A World Where Privacy and Saving Lives Can Coexist      The developer of privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet Wasabi, Max Hillebrand, said he is confident Bitcoin’s users will step up to the challenge.

42385765,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBO6xX,1611603232,Large Bitcoin Options Positions May Boost Price Volatility This Week,"Bitcoin's options market continues to grow along with an institutional-led bull run in the leading cryptocurrency. Yet, while many use options to hedge their positions, the large amounts of bitcoin options slated to expire in a few days may themselves lead to wild price swings as January draws to a close.      At press time, there are 120,300 contracts worth $4 billion set to expire this Friday on major exchanges Deribit, CME, Bakkt, OKEx, LedgerX, according to data source Skew. Much of that amount can be found on Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange by trading volume. It is on track to register a record monthly bitcoin options expiry of 102,162 contracts (nearly $3.5 billion).      A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying at a predetermined price on or before a specific date; a put option represents a right to sell. An out-of-the-money (OTM) call is the one with the strike price higher than the spot price. As of press time, call options at strike prices above the current spot price of $34,500 are OTM. Meanwhile, put options at strikes below the spot price are OTM as well.    Market makers may inject volatility    Option expiries seldom have a direct impact on the spot price. However, when open interest is concentrated in out-of-the-money (OTM) call and put options, which is the case with bitcoin, a sudden pre-expiry move forces market makers to hedge with the underlying asset. That leads to more significant price turbulence.      Over 80% of the Deribit-based Jan. 29 expiry open interest is set to expire out-of-the-money, or worthless. Notably, more than 52,600 call option contracts and 29,800 put option contracts are currently OTM, as noted by Swiss-based data provider Laevitas.      See also: Trading Hall of Fame: The Bitcoin Options Bet That Made $58.2M Profit on Just $638K      ""If BTC rapidly jumps to all-time highs within the next few days, it's expected market makers will aggressively hedge their out-of-the-money short call option exposures, which would likely increase overall market volatility and momentum in the underlying price,"" Samneet Chepal, quantitative analyst at the quantitative and systematic digital asset investment firm Ledger Prime, told CoinDesk.      Market makers are individuals or member firms of an exchange that create liquidity in the market and take the opposite side of the transaction initiated by traders/investors.      Given the recent strong bullish sentiment and massive buying in higher strike, out-of-the-money call options, market makers across the board are likely to be net short gamma (call sellers), according to Chepal.      Options gamma is the rate that delta will change based on a $1 change in bitcoin's price. Delta measures the sensitivity of options prices to the changes in the spot market price.      Being short gamma means being an option writer (seller) regardless of whether call or put. In this case, market makers are short gamma due to call selling. That makes them vulnerable to a sudden move to the higher side.      Therefore, if bitcoin rallies while heading into Friday's expiry, the market makers may aggressively hedge their OTM short call exposure by taking a long position in the spot market, leading to heightened price volatility and stronger bull momentum.      The market makers will likely spring into action if bitcoin jumps to all-time highs above $42,000 ahead of Friday, as most open interest is concentrated in higher strike price calls. ""A massive chunk of open interest is in deeper OTM call strikes above $44,000,"" Chepal said.      Data provided by analytics platform Genesis Volatility shows the largest concentration of open interest is in the $52,000 call.    Delta hedging    ""In an attempt to protect against an out-of-the-money result, options traders may likely resort to delta hedging strategies,"" Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk.      Delta hedging, or delta-neutral, comprises multiple positions (long and shorts, call/puts) aimed at reducing, hedging the directional risk associated with price movements in the underlying asset.      For instance, the delta of the $40,000 call expiring on Jan. 29 is currently 0.10. That means the option's price will change by $0.10 for every $1 change in bitcoin's price.      See also: Bitcoin Bounces as Options Market Sees 20% Chance of $50K at Month’s End      Another way to look at it is that investors currently holding a long call position with a strike at $40,000 have a BTC 0.10 delta exposure. To hedge against the exposure, traders can short sell BTC 0.10 in the spot or futures market or else buy a put option with a 0.10 delta.      Option traders generally hedge delta with options. However, in particularly fraught times they could also resort to hedging with the underlying asset itself, leading to heightened price volatility, according to Chung.      ""This can create a vicious cycle, with increased volatility leading to even more derivatives traders rushing to the same hedging strategies, which ends up having the same effect as pouring oil on an open fire,"" Chung said.      Bitcoin is currently trading near $34,100, having put in lows below $29,000 last week, according to CoinDesk 20 data. As long as these options remain open in the market, the next couple of days could be interesting – and perhaps volatile – for bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/25/large-bitcoin-options-positions-may-boost-price-volatility-this-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc941f969351a14d184be06a3a6a52c18d07d09e-1920x1320.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385763,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBO6v1,1611595413,The Future of Money in the Multiverse,"The year is 2028. Although no new coronavirus variant has become a pandemic since 2025, the three passengers boarding the plane in Austin, Texas, are wearing protective masks and glasses. They are flying to Washington, D.C., in a shared private jet designed and manufactured by SpaceX-wing and owned by a group of investors through anonymous shell companies. The three passengers flying this morning have nothing in common. Each of them lives in a separate world built on a different set of norms, technology and money.      DD, a 27-year-old whose parents immigrated to the U.S. in the 1990s, is browsing the government-provided multi-purpose platform to see the balance of its checking account with the Federal Reserve. Yes, the 10,000 “digital dollars” borrowed from that major retail corporation were finally there. Since the launch of the “digital dollars” in 2024, everyone can have an account with the Fed.    Marcelo M. Prates is a lawyer at the Central Bank of Brazil and holds a doctorate from Duke University School of Law. The views and opinions expressed here are his.    FedAccounts were not as successful as anticipated, perhaps because of the many privately issued currencies available and the growing distrust of government-backed solutions. The restrictive legislation passed in the aftermath of the 2021 Capitol attacks led many people to worry that, with direct access to all monetary transactions, the government would have an open door for vigilance and censorship.      The users who opted for the e-Gov platform counter that if it were not for the public alternative, millions of Americans would not be able to afford the private options provided by the BigTech Alliance since 2022. Essential services like payments, internet connection and education are now aggressively offered by big tech firms. As regulation could not tame Big Tech’s global ascendancy, governments had to compete.      Slightly annoyed at the rough sounds coming from DD’s device, ZB, a tech entrepreneur in her mid-40s, reclines the seat to get some rest. She has worked around the clock in the past few weeks to have the latest version of the BigTech Alliance platform ready to go live on Wednesday. The daily doses of a third-generation amphetamine recommended by a friend certainly helped to boost their productivity.      The predictive shopping functionality required several makeovers. It was tough calibrating the algorithms to generate personal shopping lists with 97% accuracy based on the data of all purchases made by users in the last 10 years. The same-hour delivery with drones and droids, in contrast, seems to be working smoothly, especially for those who live in the gated communities built by the BigTech Alliance and monitored by facial-recognition surveillance.      See also: Marcelo Prates - The Big Choices When Designing Central Bank Digital Currencies      The game changer for the success of the BigTech Alliance was the global cryptocurrency it launched in 2023. Instead of issuing stablecoins backed by sovereign money, the Alliance decided on a common cryptocurrency with its own unit of account, the BTA. The BTA is not convertible in any sovereign currency and can only be used for payments inside the BigTech Alliance platform. BTAs circulate on a permissioned blockchain managed by the big tech firms that became known as the “six sisters.” More than 4 billion people are using BTA today.      Sitting behind ZB, 60-year-old RT powers her phone off. It is the fifth burner this month. The sixth will be used in D.C.: You must always use a new phone in D.C. And carry a gun – in RT’s case, a compact semi-automatic 9mm pistol. RT is one of the founders of the AC1st platform, devised by people and institutions who lost their access to social media, internet infrastructure and financial services following the Capitol invasion.      The AC1st platform was built from the ground up, starting with the technological resources needed to host and power the network without relying on third parties. AC1st founders, refugees of the “platform wars,” knew that if they wanted to promote more controversial views they had to create their platform, applications, and even money.      And so they did. The AC1st platform provides its members with all the essential services they need, from exchanging simple messages to transferring money and recording property titles. More than that, as the platform runs on a self-hosted network of blockchains, it is completely anonymous and invisible for non-members.      See also: Marcelo Prates - 4 Myths About CBDCs Debunked      This network of blockchains also issues the 1stCoin, a cryptocurrency based on programmable rules that are automatically implemented by smart contracts to ensure price stability. Similar to the BTA issued by the BigTech Alliance, the 1stCoin cannot be converted into any sovereign currency or used outside the AC1st platform.      After one hour and 13 minutes, the jet lands in a rainy and gloomy D.C. The three passengers will soon disembark and be separated again. As the basic values and beliefs they used to share have fallen apart since the Capitol riot, this flight might have been the last time they could coexist at peace.

Centralized core? Once Bitcoin Core’s most active maintainer, Wladimir van der Laan has decided to step back. In a blog post last week, the Bitcoin lead called for the project to further decentralize away from community leaders.

(CoinDesk – Crypto Long & Short)  Market intel    Supply and demand. Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is rallying as investors appear to be rotating out of bitcoin. The number two crypto in terms of market cap hit a record high of $1,454.32, also notching a 90% year-to-date rise.      This price appreciation seems to be driven by major buyers, as evidenced by the number of ETH “whale addresses,” or those with at least 10,000 ETH, standing at 13-month highs of 1,103 on Saturday. Further, 35 whale addresses have been created this month alone and 75 since mid-November, according to analytics firm Glassnode.      Ethereum’s rally is also minting small holders. Both the number of non-zero addresses and addresses holding at least 0.1 ETH have risen to record highs, CoinDesk market guru Omkar Godbole reports.      So how do all these new bagholders affect ether’s supply? Well, some analysts are raising concerns about a coming crunch, noting that the number of coins held on exchanges fell to its lowest level since October 2019.      “ETH leaving exchanges is bullish as diminished supply makes it easier for the price to squeeze higher, generating a supply crisis,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told Godbole. “It’s clear to me large parties are accumulating.”      With ETH futures and a number of protocol upgrades on the horizon, prices could continue to climb.    At stake    Beleaguered Ethereum hub ConsenSys is joining the “Digital Belt and Road” by integrating into China’s national Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN).      ConsenSys’ Quorum ledger, built by JPMorgan and targeted towards enterprises that want to build on a private and permissioned version of Ethereum, is the latest blockchain to be wrapped into the BSN. CoinDesk’ enterprise whisperer Ian Allison reports.    ConsenSys bought Quorum from the investment bank in August 2020, for an undisclosed sum, at the same time JPMorgan placed an undisclosed strategic investment in the Ethereum incubator.  Quorum is open source and home of the “JPMorgan Coin.”    The BSN, a base-layer developer sandbox for building blockchain applications across multiple different chains, has been steadily growing since its 2020 launch.    So far it’s expanded to 108 public city nodes in 80 cities in mainland China as well as eight nodes in other cities around the world, according to a press statement.  “China is a great example of where enterprise blockchain is a strong play,” said Charles d’Haussy, director of strategic initiatives and ConsenSys’ man in Hong Kong.    Still, the future for both blockchain-based systems is unknown. While Quorum has reportedly attracted enterprise clients, according to d’Haussy, ConsenSys’ director of strategic initiatives, no specifics have been given. Similar doubts could be raised about BSN – if China builds it, will people come?      Then again, similar doubts could be extended to the whole of the blockchain industry.

In an announcement on Sunday, Vietnam’s oldest (and reportedly only Bitcoin-exclusive) exchange revealed that Lightning Network withdrawals are now open to its users. VBTC CEO Dominik Weil told CoinDesk that deposits will be available later this year.      According to an article by BitcoinVN News, the media arm of BitcoinVN, a parent company which also owns VBTC, Lightning Network withdrawals are priced at 1,000 satoshis plus 0.2% of the withdrawn amount. Normal bitcoin withdrawals have a fee of 100,000 satoshis (0.001).      Weil said that the decision was inspired in part by the high fees that a bull market brings to bitcoin, as well as pressure from the local Bitcoin community, which has already embraced Lightning to an extensive degree.      “The [Vietnamese Bitcoin] community has built an increasing interest into toying around and utilizing the Lightning Network. There are now about a dozen business in Saigon/Vietnam set up to accept Lightning payments via Neutronpay; Asia's first Lightning ATM was launched back last fall in Saigon by one of our community members in Saigon. The calls for an exchange to start being able [to support Lightning] directly has been growing over the time. So we had to deliver.”      The news comes a few days after the exchange adopted SegWit native batched transactions as well, which will allow it to batch client withdrawals together in SegWit transactions to reduce on-chain fees.    Bitcoin’s Lightning Network meets bitcoin exchanges    VBTC’s adoption makes it one of the first exchanges to go live with the burgeoning technology. It also adds to a growing list of exchanges that have pledged (or launched) support for Lightning this year as the technology continues to spread across the globe to exchanges in various parts of the world.    Read more: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?    The Bitfinex and River Financial exchanges came into 2021 with full Lightning Network support, and U.S.-based Kraken Exchange announced at the end of 2020 it would launch support sometime in 2021.      U.K.-servicing CoinCorner launched Lightning in January, and OKCoin announced last week it has been working on an integration that should be open to clients in February.      Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, whose company designs the leading Lightning Network software implementation, told BitcoinVN News that VBTC’s integration adds more charge to an already electric network effect.      “We believe bitcoin has so much potential for billions of people around the world, and VBTC’s Lightning integration is a big step in bringing it to Asia and beyond,"" she said. ""As more exchanges join the Lightning Network, more people will be able to transact instantly, across the world, with low fees.

Davis, who joined the CFTC in 2017 under former Chair Chris Giancarlo, headed the agency’s legal division for four years, overseeing the regulatory agency’s compliance with the law in rulemaking as well as enforcement actions. In 2018, Davis also authored a memo authorizing agency staff to invest in cryptocurrencies.      He left the regulator earlier this month, shortly before Giancarlo’s successor, Heath Tarbert, also stepped down from his role as CFTC chair.      “I think crypto continues to evolve,” Davis told CoinDesk in a phone call Monday. “Really broadly speaking, what I’m looking to do with my practice is remain at the cutting edge of crypto.”      This evolution may continue to be unpredictable, he said. The new presidential administration may also approach the industry differently than Donald Trump’s regulators did. Davis will work out of Katten’s Washington, D.C., office.      “I would keep an eye on enforcement actions, the types of enforcement actions and theories that agencies advance in enforcement actions give some indication of the thinking that’s coming from regulators,” he said.      There may also be legislative developments in the coming years, he said. While Congress hasn’t passed a large number of bills engaging the crypto industry to date, “there’s been a lot of talk on the [Capitol] Hill about whether to regulate” the space.      Future legislation is likely at the state, federal and even at an international level, he added.      At the CFTC, Davis oversaw the development of various derivatives products outside of the crypto space.      In his new role he plans to ensure his clients are in compliance with regulations and that rulemaking from regulatory agencies is in compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act and other laws governing how the agencies can create regulations.

42385744,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBO1y3,1611583216,Collateralized Debt Obligations Make Their Way Into DeFi Lending,"Suitably named Opium Finance has released collateralized debt obligation products (CDOs) for Compound Finance’s automated lending markets, Opium Protocol founder Andrey Belyakov told CoinDesk in a phone interview Friday.      Investors can put up the Compound debt token cDai – and soon Uniswap LP tokens – to diversify exposure to DeFi lending markets. Opium’s product pays out structured returns to both a senior and junior risk tranche in exchange. The former tranche offers a 7% fixed return on dai (a collateral-backed stablecoin) at maturity, while the latter pool offers a variable rate paid out after filling up the senior tranche’s return, a blog post shared with CoinDesk states.      As depicted in Michael Lewis’ The Big Short, CDOs are infamous for their role in monetizing the subprime mortgage crisis that spurred the 2008 financial crisis. Warren Buffet even went as far to call CDOs and other derivatives “financial weapons of mass destruction” years before the financial downturn. CDO holders lost out on expected payments when mortgage holders defaulted en masse. Banks that were over leveraged on the then-worthless debt obligations began to default themselves, such as failed financial giant Bear Stearns.      It’s thought the transparent nature of blockchain-based financial applications could limit the downside of using these complex derivatives. Moreover, the risk profile of the average DeFi lending app is vastly different than the reasons CDOs became a household name over a decade ago. DeFi apps have little chance of becoming insolvent due to programmatic liquidation settings. Rather, the risk mostly comes down to software exploits which many poorly put-together DeFi apps experienced this past year.    Read more: DeFi Exploits Can’t Be Pinned on Flash Loans, Industry Leaders Say    Belyakov said risk tranching increases the efficiency of capital on lending markets – a poorly understood problem in young DeFi markets he thinks derivatives can help address.    Risk tranching with crypto CDOs    It works as follows: A protocol issues a debt token representing a claim to funds deposited or “locked” on a DeFi app, such as cDai. These debt tokens allow those same deposits to gain exposure again on other markets. However, most DeFi investors let these debt tokens sit idle in wallets, re-invest them as collateral for other loans or put them up for yield farming. The problem is these bets often move in the same direction. Placing debt tokens into Opium’s CDO, on the other hand, acts as a categorical alternative to other forms of capital exposure, Belyakov said.      “What we did was look at the lowest-hanging fruit,” Belyakov said. “And we found that Uniswap LP tokens, Compound cDai and some others are just stored on a wallet; they are not being used as collateral or farming – you don't utilize this capital.”      The derivative joins other early attempts to protect lenders from the software risks associated with decentralized finance.

42385747,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBO21p,1611583123,First Mover: Bitcoin Flushes 'Weak Hands' as Ethereum Hits New All-Time High,"Bitcoin (BTC) was higher on Monday at around $33,000, rebounding after a 9.9% drop in the seven days through Sunday, the biggest weekly drop since August.      ""Bitcoin is seeing some consolidation itself after surviving another run at $30,000,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for the London-based foreign exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote Monday in an investor update. ""A move back above $35,000 may start to change the conversation but the trend is against it these last few weeks and a move lower still looks more likely.""      Ether (ETH), the main cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, rose early Monday to a new all-time high price of $1,476.12. Ether, which is the second-biggest digital asset by market value after bitcoin, has nearly doubled just in January alone.      ""Given the dip from bitcoin and the steadiness of [ether], we could see investors move capital into the latter as they look for the next crypto asset that is going to perform in the current bull run,"" David Derhy, an analyst with the trading platform eToro, said in emailed comments.      Read More: Big Investors Stacked up Ether as Price Rose to Record High      In traditional markets, Asian and European shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open as investors weighed the odds of more economic stimulus. Gold strengthened 0.4% to $1,864 an ounce.    Market moves    Bitcoin is coming off its worst week in almost five months, but the main takeaway, according to veteran digital-market traders and analysts, is that it wasn't really all that bad.      A quick glance at price charts shows that declines at least as large as last week's 9.9% retreat have happened nine times in the past two years.      And the cryptocurrency's price has risen so dramatically and consistently over the period that those prior corrections almost look quaint. The worst sell-off in recent memory was the 33.5% weekly plunge in March 2020, when the devastating economic toll of the coronavirus became clear to global investors. But in absolute dollar terms, that $2,690 drop was less than last week's $3,950 loss, showing just how far bitcoin's price has climbed since then.      According to Kraken, the cryptocurrency exchange, buyers appeared to materialize last week whenever prices fell to about $30,000. That's just above the $29,112 level where bitcoin started off the year, following a 2020 when it quadrupled in price.      ""While 10%+ drawdowns shake conviction, these moves have been met with strong bids,"" Delphi Digital, a cryptocurrency analysis firm, told clients Friday in a note. ""Shaking out profit takers and 'weak hands' is necessary for BTC to make strides upwards.""      According to Chainalysis, a blockchain-analysis firm, bitcoin's recent rally to new record highs above $40,000 may have been too much to resist for speculators who have only recently nosed into the cryptocurrency arena, lured by the outsize returns of recent years.      ""New buyer behavior is still a major source of medium-term price volatility and is currently elevated,"" Philip Gradwell, chief economist for New York-based Chainalysis, wrote Friday. ""It is important to restate that the bitcoin price is still at historically very high levels.""      Ryan Selkis, CEO of the digital-markets analysis firm Messari, wrote that last week's tumble ""looked like a nice little dip for new buyers, and a wealth transfer from some of the weakest-handed sellers I've seen in crypto to those with an actual investment thesis.""      Data extracted from the bitcoin blockchain network show the number of addresses with at least 1,000 or more bitcoins increased last week – an indication that large institutional buyers may have been stepping into the market as prices dipped, CoinDesk's Muyao Shen reported Friday.      ""The buying pressure seen in the lower bounds of the current range have been solid,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS, told clients early Monday in a note. ""The selling pressure above is in no way weaker. If bulls manage to break out, though, the move to the next level ($34,855) could be explosive and even take us further, back to the upper $38Ks.""      The upshot? Further downside might still be in store, but the limited scope of last week's price decline reveals plenty of demand for bitcoin at levels well above prices that prevailed in 2020.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    The bitcoin market is showing signs of weakening demand from U.S.-based institutions, according to Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital.      Comparing bitcoin's price moves during Asia daytime hours and American hours (split into 12 hours each) shows a clear pattern of relentless buying during the North American trading hours and selling in Asia, mainly by large investors (known as whales) and cryptocurrency miners.      The pattern emerged following the March 2020 price crash and had endured until two weeks ago when bitcoin reached record highs above $41,900. Since then, the strength during U.S. hours has lost momentum, QCP Capital noted in its Telegram channel.      The flat-to-negative ""Coinbase Premium"" – the spread between Coinbase’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair, which includes the stablecoin tether – also suggests absence of strong demand from high-net-worth individuals and institutions.      ""I'll keep my bearish bias until there are significant Coinbase premium and Coinbase outflow,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, tweeted on Sunday. ""BTC needs [U.S. dollar] spot inflows from institutional investors to start the next bull run.""      As such, odds appear stacked against the cryptocurrency keeping gains above $33,000.      ""We could be in for a classic 'W' bottom when the first bounce off the lows is met by another batch of selling before it eventually bounces back for real,"" David Lifchitz, chief investment officer of the Paris-based quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.      - Omkar Godbole    Token watch    Ether (ETH): Three reasons to be bullish include next month's CME futures launch, the planned transition to 2.0 ""staking network"" and possible token burns via the EIP 1559 update (CoinDesk)      Chainlink (LINK): Data-oracle token hits new all-time high price above $25 (CoinDesk)    What's hot    Key executive at Huobi crypto exchange said to be taken into custody by Chinese police in investigation related to over-the-counter trading service.

Before that can happen, though, cryptocurrencies must overcome hurdles including high volatility, regulatory acceptance and reputational risks, according to a research note from the bank reported by The National News on Sunday.  “First, investors need trustworthy institutions to be able to hold digital currencies securely. Second, liquidity needs to improve significantly to reduce volatility to manageable levels,” wrote Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief economist at Bank of Singapore.  If the issues can be addressed, bitcoin could have a place in investors' portfolios as a potential safe-haven asset and means to diversify assets, he said.  Cryptocurrencies offer the benefit that they are easy to move and store when compared with precious metals, though they are also prone to theft via hacking, per the note.  Mohi-uddin doesn't see cryptos replacing fiat currencies, however, as he considers them an inefficient unit of exchange.  “Governments are very wary of any technology that could potentially displace national currencies. This would reduce the ability of policymakers to print money during economic crises,” he added.

As part of the partnership, announced Monday, ConsenSys Quorum, an open-source protocol layer that serves as a foundation for businesses to build Ethereum-based applications, will be available in about 80 different cities through BSN’s public city nodes throughout mainland China.      “China is a great example of where enterprise blockchain is a strong play,” said Charles d'Haussy, director of strategic initiatives and ConsenSys’ man in Hong Kong. “What Ethereum is doing with ConsenSys Quorum is connecting people who are essentially migrating from the permissioned chain to the global chain.”      It’s a plum announcement for Quorum, the privacy-centric blockchain originally designed by engineers from JPMorgan. Quorum appeared to be in the wilderness for a time, between being spun out of the bank and re-housed within the ConsenSys ecosystem.      “Quorum was very much associated with JPMorgan, but there was also this open-source software which was available to many developers,” said d'Haussy in an interview. “It may not have been apparent, but there was this large audience of enterprise users, and we are now bringing to this ecosystem other products and applications from ConsenSys.”    Read more: ConsenSys Acquires JPMorgan’s Quorum Blockchain    The BSN was founded in April 2020 by Red Date Technology, a Beijing-based software company, China UnionPay and China Mobile.

42385738,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBO1nz,1611579657,Crypto Miner Marathon Patent Group Buys $150M in Bitcoin,"Cryptocurrency mining company Marathon Patent Group (MARA) bought $150 million in bitcoin for around $31,100 apiece during the crypto asset’s recent price rout.      The Nasdaq-listed firm said Monday it purchased the cryptocurrency through institutional bitcoin shop NYDIG. Marathon is the latest publicly traded company to swap a cash treasury for bitcoin, and, with 4,812.66 BTC now on the books, one of the largest by sheer investment size.      Marathon CEO Merrick Okamoto said in a statement the bitcoin buy “accelerates” his mining company’s transformation into a “pure-play bitcoin investment option” for crypto-hungry Wall Street traders.      Wall Street traders already have a few options on that front, some more creative than others. There’s Square, the payments company and Cash App owner with 4,702 BTC. And there’s Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has purchased over 600,000 BTC for its investors, many institutional. (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group).      But Nasdaq’s flashiest indirect bitcoin exposure vehicle is perhaps business intelligence company MicroStrategy, whose semi-regular bitcoin buys (it now holds 70,784 coins) have wooed investors, and boosted MSTR's share price 370% since July.      Read more: Michael Saylor: Bitcoin’s Cyber Hornet      Bitcoin mining company stocks have tracked with the market-leading crypto asset's recent price boom. But Marathon's investment strengthens its ties even further, seeking to peg its appeal even more tightly to bitcoin with the investment.      While fellow public crypto miners Riot Blockchain and Hut 8 (a Canadian firm) also hold bitcoin on their balance sheet, those larger miners amassed their troves by mining and holding, not, like Marathon, through a direct investment model.      They’ve been more successful by the numbers. In Q3 2020 Riot reported $2.4 million in mining revenue and Hut 8 disclosed $4 million. Marathon’s far smaller mining fleet generated just $835,184 in revenue in the same period.      The bitcoin mining industry is now going through what Okamoto has called an “arms race” for new rigs. More mining machines means more mining power means more potential bitcoin, and Marathon is racing to catch up.      Marathon entered 2021 on a cash-raising tear as CEO Okamoto raced to win the mining rig “arms race.” Determined to push its rig count above 103,000 by next year, the company raised $200 million in early January and an additional $250 million just over a week later. Okamoto has said the capital infusions will fund business expansions.      See also: Hut 8 Completes $11.8M Financing for New Bitcoin Mining Machines      The company will not reach its target mining capacity anytime soon. In the interim, it’s leveraging its cash “to invest in bitcoin now,” Okamoto said.

42385746,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBO20Z,1611574154,Big Investors Stacked Up Ether as Price Rose to Record High,"Strong hands look to have been backing the recent rally to record highs for Ethereum's ether cryptocurrency.      The number of whale addresses (those holding at least 10,000 ETH) jumped to a 13-month high of 1,103 on Saturday, according to on-chain data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. More than 35 whale addresses have been created this month alone, and 75 since mid-November.      The increased accumulation by investors with deep pockets may have put upward pressure on ether's price.      The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value rose to a record high of $1,450 late Sunday and was last seen changing hands near $1,405, representing a 90% gain on a year-to-date basis, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Small investors looked to have participated in the rally, too. Both the number of non-zero addresses and addresses holding at least 0.1 ETH have risen to record highs.      While the on-chain data is encouraging for ether bulls, drawing conclusions from metrics focusing on address growth changes should be done with care because a single user can control multiple addresses. However, the data would appear to indicate an influx of money into the ether market, probably via new and existing investors.    Supply shortage?    Data also shows ether is leaving centralized exchanges, possibly creating a supply shortage and facilitating a stronger bullish move, according to one analyst.      The number of coins held on exchanges fell to 15,469,582 over the weekend, the lowest level since October 2019. The exchange balance has declined by more than 1 million in the past four days alone.      Further, exchanges witnessed a net outflow of 666,689 ETH on Jan. 20, the biggest single-day exodus since May 2019.      ""ETH leaving exchanges is bullish as diminished supply makes it easier for the price to squeeze higher, generating a supply crisis,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk. ""It's clear to me large parties are accumulating.""      Ether's outflow from centralized exchanges does not necessarily mean investors are taking direct custody of their coins, which would be the case with bitcoin.      Some traders are likely depositing ether into decentralized exchanges and liquidity pools, while others could be ""staking"" coins to earn passive income. Staking refers to locking up cryptocurrency to receive rewards for participating in transaction validation on a proof-of-stake blockchain. Ethereum, which is shifting over to a fundamental upgrade, launched its Beacon Chain for that purpose in December.    Stronger gains ahead?    ""The ETH slingshot is only now being drawn back, and we can expect a powerful upward move in the first half of 2021,"" Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital said, adding that increased staking and the growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) is ratcheting up organic demand for the cryptocurrency.      Ether locked in DeFi applications has increased from 6.615 million to 7.002 million in the past 15 days. However, the tally remains well below the early January high of 7.30 million and the 2020 high of 9.771 million, according to DeFi Pulse.      The options market is flashing strongly bullish sentiment, with one, three- and six-month put-call skews trading below zero, a sign of calls (bullish bets) drawing higher prices than puts (bearish bets), according to data source Skew.

Ciaran Martin, who was the founding chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), told The Guardian that insurance firms sending funds on behalf of affected companies have made it “OK to pay out to criminals.”  “People are paying bitcoin to criminals and claiming back cash” via insurance claims, Martin said.  Criminal gangs often from Russia or other former Soviet states are fueling the ransomware problem, according to the report.  The U.K.’s extortion laws were formed mainly in response to the threat of kidnapping and forbid the payment of ransoms to terrorists, but don't apply to ransomware demands.  “In the last year, experts are saying this is close to getting out of control,” said Martin. “You have to look seriously about changing the law on insurance and banning these payments, or at the very least having a major consultation with the industry”.
