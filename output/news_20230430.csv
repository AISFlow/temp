As the region opens the trading week, crypto’s major tokens are largely flat.  Bitcoin is up 0.7% to $29,404, while ether is down 0.5% to $1,892.  ""Bitcoin has remained below $30,000, which is a key resistance level, but has not had to test any major supports just yet,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk in a note. “For now, the market is expecting a 25 [basis point] rate hike in the [Federal Open Market Committee meeting] this week, but we are likely to see price swings following the [Federal Reserve's] post-release commentary.""  Traders on the prediction market Polymarket are putting the likelihood of a 25 basis point (bps) rate hike at 97%, while the CME’s FedWatch tool is putting that chance at around 82%.  “The attempts to breach $30,000 this week have failed to make a higher high, which should be concerning for the bulls,” DiPasquale also wrote. “In general, we would not be surprised to see the market leader testing $25,000 in the coming days, particularly after the FOMC.”  Meanwhile, other crypto majors were also flat, including the tokens of layer 1 blockchains Solana and Avalanche, with the latter AVAX token falling 1.2%.

Members of CoinDesk's editorial team assembled on Twitter Spaces as the event was winding down to assess the big picture at Consensus 2023 and share their takeaways on critical issues that will shape how the industry continues to evolve.

Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Nick Baker, CoinDesk deputy editor-in-chief  Being a Consensus newbie this year, I am like a small-town yokel blown away by how big and impressive this event has been. Here are a couple of my takeaways:  One, the level of optimism people have about crypto is very high, which is a surprise given just how bad the regulatory outlook is. And I know it's partly self-selection bias at work: People who are going to pay a lot of money to attend this event are going to be optimistic about the space. Still, that juxtaposition of existential questions and lots of optimism is striking to me.  Two, the people I know best are from traditional finance and they, too, remain quite high on the future of crypto and moving TradFi stuff to crypto or crypto-adjacent infrastructure. Now, of course, they’ve been trying for years to show progress along those lines and have little to show for it. But they’re undeterred. This point rhymes with my first point.  Ben Schiller, head of Consensus Magazine  Something that really struck me arose from what Kate Brady, head of communications for Web3 at PepsiCo, said on stage. As you know, PepsiCo is a very mainstream American brand. It's not part of the crypto industry by any means, but it’s looking to get into Web3. And one of the things she said on stage was that she was being stymied in her work and PepsiCo has been stymied in its work by the lack of regulatory clarity, and I thought that was interesting because obviously this is something the industry says a lot that we need to do. There are guidelines from Washington, D.C., from lawmakers and from policymakers. And we think that that conversation or that that issue only affects people in the relatively small world of crypto.

However, CSPR, the native token of the Casper Network, is one of the biggest gainers, surging by 13.9% over the last seven days. While fairly popular, CSPR has been one of the most impressive tokens of 2023, with a staggering profit record. Chart data from Coingecko shows that the altcoin soared by 60% in the month of April, moving its total market gains in 2023 to a stunning 114.4%. At the time of writing, CSPR is trading around $0.058, with a 6.5% price jump in the last 24 hours. Its daily trading volume, valued at $14.98 million, is up by 41.65%. Meanwhile, its market cap value is set at an impressive $682.12 million.

Casper is a developer-friendly, business-centered public blockchain designed to serve as a platform for the secure, fast, and efficient development of sustainable blockchain-based products. Touted as the future-proof blockchain, Casper is the brainchild of product developer Medha Parlikar and angel investor Mrinal Manohar. The Casper mainnet was launched in 2021, and it runs on a unique variant of the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm known as the Highway Protocol. The Highway Protocol functions as an energy-efficient and flexible consensus protocol, which enables networks to finalize transactions in a non-binary manner, thus allowing blocks on Casper to be created in a faster time than other blockchains. In addition, Casper offers users upgradeable smart contracts, another unique network feature that allows developers to modify their already deployed contracts, enabling businesses to build blockchain products that adapt to consumer needs and market trends. Casper is also popular for its low gas fee structure supported by its advanced PoS mechanism. As earlier stated, its native token is known as CSPR and is utilized for payment of network fees, staking, and rewards for network validators. Related Reading: Render Delivers With 40% Gain As RNDR Dominates Sunday Charts Will CSPR Soar Higher? Due to CSPR’s remarkable performance, there is much speculation on the ability of the token to maintain its current bullish momentum as investors try to determine profit-making opportunities. According to the popular crypto prediction site, Coincodex, the investor sentiment presently surrounding CSPR is quite bullish. Meanwhile, its Fear and Greed Index hovers around 60, indicating the token may be a favorable investment at the moment. Coincodex predicts that Casper will rise by 11.42% in the next five days, hitting a price of $0.065. However, their projections do not indicate a long-term faith in CSPR, as they expect the token to have slumped by 30% in the next month. That said, investors are reminded these predictions are merely speculations and should not be relied on as investment advice.

According to data from CoinGecko, the cryptocurrency is the 46th-largest token, with a current market cap of $1.1 billion. Meanwhile, blue-chip cryptocurrencies BTC and ETH have also gained 5.2% and 1.5%, respectively, in the last seven days. Related Reading: Radix (XRD) Soars 18% On Heels Of Milestone RCnet Success Radix Up By 167% In 30-Day Price Rally The past week’s headlines were dominated by the First Republic Bank’s ongoing crisis and the anticipated return of Bitcoin’s price to 30k. As a result, the market performance of most altcoins, including Radix, has largely gone under the radar. CoinGecko data reveals that RDX is one of the best-performing tokens in the last seven days. Interestingly, a broader look at the market shows that this bullish run stretches as far back as a month. In the past 30 days, XRD has rallied a staggering 167% price increase, reaching a 12-month high of $0.15 level during the period. This price upswing came with a boost in market capitalization, enabling Radix to break into the top 50 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. As of this writing, XRD is valued at $0.111545, tallying a 5.1% price jump in the past 24 hours. However, it is worth noting that the coin’s trading volume slipped by 16.40% in the same period, indicating a recent dip in market activity. XRDUSD trading at $0.10774 | Source: XRDUSD chart from TradingView Milestone Radix Upgrade, Babylon, To Launch In July It appears that the recent price rally of Radix is connected to the impending upgrade slated for July. According to Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, Radix’s March fundraiser and the highly-anticipated upgrade seem to have heightened interest in the XRD token. Price action reveals that the XRD gained more than 15% on March 23, the day the fundraiser was announced. A week after, the coin would experience a remarkable price surge in the wake of the Release Candidate network (RCNet) rollout. That said, the mainnet, codenamed Babylon, is scheduled to launch on 31st July and introduce smart-contract functionality to the decentralized Radix network. Babylon will enable developers to build robust and excellent decentralized applications. “The Radix Public Network upgrade from Olympia to Babylon will occur on or about July 31st, 2023, paving the way for global Web3 and DeFi to finally exit the ‘tech demo’ stage with a mainstream-capable user and developer experience,” Radix stated in its official announcement. Furthermore, this upgrade will natively facilitate the liquid staking of XRD tokens through the issuance of Liquid Stake Unit tokens. Ultimately, this means that there won’t be a need for other equivalent staking protocols, such as Lido.

The crypto actually dominated the roster of the day’s leading coins. Render (RNDR) has been among the top performing crypto assets in the last few weeks. Render allows owners of the increasingly powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) industry to deliver computing power during periods of low demand. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential Source: CoinMarketCap Render (RNDR) – At A Glance The Render (RNDR) Network is a blockchain-powered, decentralized, high-performance, distributed-computing platform. It was developed to help businesses in the film, animation, gaming, and architecture industries complete complicated rendering projects quickly and affordably. To fulfill the need of large-scale rendering projects, the RNDR Network offers a scalable and decentralized solution by letting users leverage underutilized GPU capacity from other network participants to speed up their rendering processes. The RNDR coin is the in-network currency that may be exchanged for computer power, staked for network rewards, and used to elect leaders. In sum, the RNDR Network utilizes blockchain technology and distributed computing in an effort to completely overhaul the rendering process. Network Gains Traction And Attention It’s no surprise that Render has been getting a lot of attention lately, what with the proliferation of the metaverse and the growing need for rendering services in a wide range of enterprises. So, the recent uptick in RNDR should not come as a surprise: widespread consensus among the rendering community to get ready for the inevitable increase in demand. Render debuted in 2017 and spent the first half of 2018 in private sale. Render takes advantage of Ethereum’s built-in security features when uploading and transferring nodes to operators, as the network is based on the Ethereum blockchain. Source: Coingecko RNDR Rallies Strong At the time of writing, RNDR was trading at $2.47, up 41% in the last week. Over the course of a two-week timeframe, the token has rallied 46%, while maintaining a solid 93% increase in the monthly period, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. Render Network Proposal 002 and Render Network Proposal 003 have both recently been given the green light by the Render project’s governance section.

The altcoin initially rose from $0.37 but was later rejected at $0.45. However, over the last 24 hours, there has been a slight increase of 1.3%, while the weekly chart indicates a 6.2% price increase. The technical analysis of ADA suggests that the bulls are attempting to take control of the price. Demand and accumulation showed signs of recovery. Related Reading: XRP May Rally Over 10% Upon Breaching Two Critical Levels Despite the slow progress in the ADA price, there is a critical resistance level that must be surpassed to trigger a rally. For the bulls to gain further momentum, buying strength must increase significantly in the upcoming trading sessions. Additionally, major altcoins have been stagnant due to Bitcoin’s difficulty in reaching $30,000. If BTC reclaims this level, it could propel ADA bulls to drive up the price in the subsequent trading sessions. Furthermore, the market capitalization of ADA has recovered, indicating that buying pressure is returning to the market. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.40. The overhead resistance was $0.42. This level has proven to be a significant hurdle for Cardano in the past, and multiple attempts to break through it have been unsuccessful. However, if ADA manages to move above this resistance level, it could trigger a rally and push the price towards $0.46. On the other hand, if the price falls from its current level, the support level stands at $0.39. If ADA fails to remain above this support level, it could lead to a drop in price to $0.36. The amount of ADA traded in the last session turned green, indicating an influx of buyers. Technical Analysis While there has been a slight uptick in demand for ADA, the buying strength on the daily chart has seen a slight downtick. The Relative Strength Index remains above the half-line, suggesting that buyers still have control of the market. However, Cardano’s movement below the 20-Simple Moving Average line indicates that sellers may take over soon as the demand is not adequate. This reading implies that sellers are driving the price momentum in the market. ADA formed sell signals in line with other indicators. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence showed red histograms under the half-line, indicating a signal to sell, based on price momentum and reversals. Related Reading: How Soon Will Litecoin Breach This Psychological Resistance Level? The Directional Movement Index was negative, indicating negative price momentum, with the -DI line (orange) above the +DI line (blue).
