According to a report from CoinDesk Korea on Tuesday, court documents reveal that a Bithumb user with the surname Park said he'd placed 478 million Korean won in his account with Bithumb on Nov. 30 2017 and within hours someone, assumed to be a hacker, had logged into his account and exchanged the cash for ethereum.  Over the same day, Park alleged, Bithumb allowed the ethereum to be transacted out of his wallet four times. As a result, the only funds left when he returned to his account were cryptos worth 121 won (11 U.S. cents) and less than a dollar in cash.  In an attempt to reclaim his funds, Park took Bithumb's parent firm, BTCKorea.com, to a civil court in the Korean capital Seoul, stating: ""Considering that Bithumb offers similar services to the financial sector, it requires a high degree of security measures required by financial institutions.""  He also pointed to a major breach of personal information breach that occurred in Bithumb in April 2017 as a possible leak of his account details, and argued the exchange did not live up to its expected fiduciary obligations to act in the best interests of customers. In the 2017 breach, thousands of Bithumb customers had their personal data stolen after malicious code was placed on the platform. Bitsy Korea.com received penalties of 58 million won from authorities as a result.  In its arguments to court, the exchange said, ""According to the Electronic Financial Transactions Act, Bithumb is not responsible for compensation because it is not a financial company, an electronic financier, or an electronic financial assistant. ... Since we have strengthened our security policy since the leak of personal information, we have fulfilled our obligation to be a diligent manager.""  The judge overseeing the case ultimately backed Bithumb, agreeing that the Electronic Financial Transactions Act does not apply to the exchange, and adding that cryptocurrency is ""mainly used as speculative means, so it cannot be regarded as an electronic means of payment.""  Further, the judge said that it can't be determined that Park lost his personal data in the April 2017 data breach and suggested that he might have lost his Bithumb login details via a phishing website, or his cellphone might have been hacked.  Finally, regarding the claim that the exchange had not lived up to its fiduciary duty, the court said that was not the case as Bithumb had in fact sent 10 SMS messages to Park about the hacker's withdrawals to alert him to the fund movements, which must be manually approved by the exchange.

42402379,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd4D5T,1545836423,Asset-Backed Securities: Entering the Crypto Conversation in 2019,"Charlie Moore is the CEO of Global Debt Registry, a fintech startup seeking to transform structured credit using blockchain technology.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  We are at the end of another busy autumn conference season, and I have had the opportunity to speak at half a dozen events to focus on the intersection of capital markets and distributed ledger technology.  As we wind down for the holidays and plan for 2019, I wanted to reflect on the key themes and current trends in structured credit based on my interactions with leaders and innovators in the market.  This year, ABS East saw an encouraging level of DLT specialists from larger industry participants attend for the first time. The underlying technology is now a few years old, and senior leaders in the securitization industry have become increasingly familiar with the end-value state of cheaper and faster transactions with greater asset integrity.  There is now a growing consensus that the decentralized nature of DLT supports our sector's broader digital transformation goals, and that it can help us move away from a siloed ecosystem that has not been able to realize the same common protocol benefits seen in other asset classes.  The ABS opportunity  Harmonized data standards, shared infrastructure and immutable records have the ability to transform how asset-backed securities participants interact in the ecosystem.  Everybody, myself included, is on a journey of discovery here. That journey started over three years ago with a recognition of immutable, better record-keeping. This was followed by understanding of the value of a shared system of record to ensure that all permissioned parties in a transaction to have access the same underlying loan information.  These autumn conferences focused on the next phase of on-chain digital assets. In discussing these digital assets I’ve often been asked, “Don’t we already have digital loans?”  Even within the minority of the asset-backed securities market, where the application and origination process has been digitized, a PDF of a loan document is very different from a digital asset in the efficiency and sophistication with which it can be transacted in the credit markets.  A loan as a digital asset on-chain can be transacted with the ease, speed and certainty of other digital assets like cryptocurrencies (AML/KYC permitting), while the PDF document is still dependent on the legacy model taking weeks and significant cost to execute transactions, with limited contextual asset information attached or ability to run smart contracts.  We are seeing the emergence of two paths here: asset-backed tokens (or loan-backed) and loans native to the blockchain. In the token model, the original authoritative copy of the loan document is securely locked down with an associated token representing ownership interest and core asset characteristics.  This facilitates more efficient transactions and introduces a chain of title and verification not seen before in the market. In the native model, the loan lives solely on the blockchain, cannot be copied, printed, double spent or misrepresented.  Given the majority of lending is still paper-based, we expect to see a domination of asset-backed tokens for a while. The transaction and management of both asset types in the capital markets we call Digital Structured Credit.  Current stage of adoption  It is fair to say that capital markets is over the “hype” phase of Gartner’s adoption model with DLT.  As with any new technology, many overestimate the speed of adoption, but the market underestimates equally the long-term impact. The credit market is slightly behind most electronically traded asset classes that saw low risk in applying DLT to settlement & clearing inefficiencies.  We are hearing less about new proof-of-concept projects as the marketing value of DLT subsides and the business cases demonstrate clear benefits. Building the right social constructs, standards and incentives for value to be realized across the asset-backed securities ecosystem is arguably more important than building the underlying technology.  One of the core pillars for all digital asset classes has been custody. This had been a gap for institutional players to participate, particularly with cryptocurrencies, but still applicable to all digital assets.  In 2018, we have seen significant progress with established players like Fidelity introducing market offerings that will help drive adoption. In asset-backed securities, I continue to see commercial demand for private keys to digital structured credit being held by an established, independent custodian to deliver seamless integration to the existing securities custody and value-added services that investors demand.  Most professionals are now comfortable with the scalability, security and permissioned vs public implementation options for DLT. While asset-backed securities have relatively low volumes of data and transactions in comparison to other electronically traded asset classes, we foresee the benefits of these efforts to allow greater capabilities and on-chain development for the market.  The leading capital markets projects represented at these conferences were utilizing permissioned blockchains, with the expected controls and security, and not looking to change the industry access paradigm.  Some of the most common discussions among panelists this autumn included looking back at the credit crisis and a look forward at whom will benefit from the efficiency gains.  Could DLT have prevented the credit crisis? As with any technology, it is only as good as how humans have chosen to deploy it! (Ignoring the AI debate). There were obviously many well documented factors here, but few would argue that the immutability, enhanced data integrity and, shared system of record in keeping track of assets, diligence and all economic interests would have helped reduce impact.  Who will realize the efficiency gains created by DLT in the asset-backed securities market?  The parties who control blockchain nodes, the management of assets and the ability to author smart contracts will have significant influence on how future value is distributed.  Time will tell which constituents will drive this transition.  Have an opinionated take on 2018? CoinDesk is seeking submissions for our 2018 in Review.

42381429,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95lYV,1545832873,India May Legalize Cryptos But Under 'Strong' Rules: Report,"The Indian government could possibly legalize cryptocurrencies, but with tough terms and conditions attached, a news report suggests.  According to a New Indian Express article published Wednesday, an interdisciplinary committee set up by the government to investigate cryptocurrencies, is not in favor of an outright ban.  An anonymous senior official who attended the committee’s meetings told the newspaper:  “We have already had two meetings. There is a general consensus that cryptocurrency cannot be dismissed as completely illegal. It needs to be legalized with strong riders. Deliberations are on.”  The government set up the committee in April 2017 with the remit of examining the existing legal framework related to digital currencies and suggesting new measures to deal with the technology, including addressing issues around consumer protection and money laundering. Members include representatives from government departments for the economy and taxation, as well as the central bank and other agencies.  The second iteration of the group is now reportedly expected to submit its new report to the country’s finance ministry by February 2019.  The article apparently indicates a softening of stance by the committee, which, back in October, recommended that the government develop an “appropriate legal framework to ban the use of private cryptocurrencies in India.”  Further dampening the country's cryptocurrency industry amid confusing messages over the legal status of bitcoin and its crypto peers, an April order by the Reserve Bank of India, India's central bank, prevented domestic banks from providing services to cryptocurrency firms such as exchanges.  Since then exchanges have been seeking ways to keep their businesses from failing, entering legal petitions to overturn the RBI ban at the country’s supreme court. Seeking guidance, the court, on Oct. 26, asked the government to provide its opinion on cryptocurrencies within two weeks.  While, no official announcement has yet been made to provide guidance, that situation looks likely to change in coming months.

42381439,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95ljp,1545830420,Bulls Under Pressure After Bitcoin Price Retreats from $4K,"Bitcoin's recent forays into price territory above $4,000 have been beaten back over the holiday, putting the bulls under pressure to regain momentum.  The cryptocurrency had peaked to around $4,140 on Dec. 21, then to over $4,200 on Dec. 24, but dropped sharply back to around $3,720 early yesterday. A small bullish bounce since has now subsided and, at press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $3,762, as per CoinDesk data.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization now looks to be consolidating under a lower low, potentially building momentum for another push above $4,000 should buy pressure persist above two key resistance levels.  Daily chart  In our previous article, we discussed a possible visitation to resistance (R2 on chart) at $4,400, based on the measured Fibonacci extension taken on the daily chart. Bitcoin barely peaked out at $4,236 (R1), however, before it was rejected to lows not seen since Dec. 20, resulting in the formation of the temporary support.  Currently, it would appear that bitcoin doesn’t have the capacity to climb higher, as volume is falling with rising prices on the smaller time frames (1-hour chart, 30-min chart).  Pressure is now mounting for the bulls to make a play above $4,200 or risk conceding the short-term up-trend they had struggled hard to win.  2-hour chart  The bears will now be hoping to force prices down past the temporary support line and to close below $3,650.  The 2-hour volume bars are varied as price action continues to subside from the Dec. 24/25 sell-off, implying reactions are mixed and traders may begin to grow anxious at these levels. If so, another move down is most likely.  View  A short-term sell-off showed bitcoin’s temporary support lay at around $3,675 with a small bullish bounce triggered from that zone.  Bitcoin was rejected from around $4,200 on Dec. 24/25, signalling bullish exhaustion.  A drop below $3,650 would dash short/mid-term bullish hopes heading into the new year.

The filing, published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on Tuesday, outlines a system via which a cash-handling devices could utilize blockchain technology to “accelerate transaction speed and/or facilitate other types of transactions in addition to ATM transactions like cash withdrawals and deposits, such as gift registry transactions.”  Blockchain could also help such devices “handle a relatively larger amount of transaction volume while reducing its physical cash transportation needs,” the document reads.  Currently, most ATMs are dedicated to their respective banks and those institutions' operating systems, Bank of America said in the filing, yet support for multi-purpose, ""multi-tenant"" – different stakeholders that share access to a single software system – functions is needed to offer various micro-services related to brand and marketing opportunities.  The bank is effectively looking to implement “ATM as a Service” to enable customers without existing relationship with a participating financial institution to transfer money across the same ATM network or even access point-to-point video communication using the ATM.  As the patent explains that, to do this, the system would implement an ""open and robust"" data transport layer with ""full"" encryption and security.  It goes on:  ""The data transport supporting ATM management, signaling, and non-financial institution and financial institution transactions may be strictly communicated to a cloud platform ... and subsequent hosting of web and application services may allow secure and scalable operations. ""  The patent filing is just the latest to emerge from Bank of America, which has filed more than 50 blockchain-related patents as of August 2018, according to a research report by iPR Daily, a media outlet specializing in intellectual property.

42381442,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95lnb,1545822008,3 Conflicts That Will Shape Blockchain Tech in 2019,"Arwen Smit is the founder of MintBit, a boutique blockchain consultancy, and DOVU, a tokenized startup for the mobility sector.                  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  From security token offerings to the crypto winter, a lot has happened in 2018.  Beyond the flashy headlines, though, larger trends are manifesting. I believe three areas of conflict, between six ""incompatible truths,"" have been slowly taking shape, and that 2019 will see them unleashed in full force.  1. Ideology vs product-market fit  Venture capital funding is dead, so they say.  By crowdfunding token creation events early, blockchain startups have taken a different route to market than the unicorns we know today. Web 2.0 startups raised in tranches. Web 3.0 startups raise early, in bulk. Web 2.0 startups wrote a ridiculous valuation around their Series D. Web 3.0 startups obtain a ridiculous valuation on day one.  Both startups look for product-market fit, but the biggest difference between the two is that Web 3.0 companies need, and advocate, their ideology as the final product on day one. From ideology all else follows. Ideology is the coordinating principle between all parties taking part in the ecosystem.  Amazon set out to to use internet protocols to transform book buying into the fastest, easiest and most enjoyable shopping experience possible. Although Google has kept its mission statement of ""organizing the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful"" for over 14 years, its interpretation of the statement has changed dramatically.  Such a change is relatively easy to achieve in a centrally organized company. Now imagine that when proposing a change of direction, Amazon and Google needed buy-in from all their stakeholders. Would they still be where they are today? Maybe, but probably not. Aligning and evolving ideology at scale is tremendously complex.  In 2019, we will see a shift. Open-source initiatives will still crowdfund from the garage-phase onward, but Web 3.0 companies with a profit function will to wait until they demonstrate early product-market fit, typical for an A-round.  In short, 2019 will be the comeback of the VCs.  2. Market capitalization vs adoption  Consider two numbers: 131,000,000,000 and 10,000.  The first one is the total crypto market capitalization in dollars, which is spread over 2,000 crypto-assets. The latter is the total dapp user base of ethereum. Now let’s look at adoption.  Close to 14,000 venues worldwide accept bitcoin. Look at all that impressive red. Until you realize that in the U.S. alone there are 47,481 people named John Smith. ""But, wait,"" you say. ""Crypto’s main feature is a currency!"" Reality hits again. The most popular ethereum decentralised exchange (DEX) has just over 700 daily active users (DAU).  We could argue only a subsection of those active within the crypto space frequents DEX daily. However, games, which encourage DAU as a metric, aren’t doing much better.  In 2019, we’ll realize that the valuation metrics we use as a sector are broken.  The metric of multiplying circulating tokens with price is ridiculous. Together with exponential adoption of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and crypto assets alike, we’ll see the industry mature in how we evaluate these new models of creating value.  3. Believers vs non-believers  Every time a Jamie Dimon or Nouriel Roubini gets a platform, a tweet storm to set the facts straight is not far away.  A shouting match ensues between the ""crypto bros"" and the ""bitcoin-is-a-scam"" camp, doing little for mutual understanding or empathy. Historically, every major shift has required a strong foundation of support. Evangelists who keep challenging, challenging, and challenging the status quo, until it dents. The DLT community has got tenacity in spades.  Now it needs a new narrative.  The market is moving at a thousand different paces. We’ve seen teams who completed a successful token creation event, but were swallowed by their communities. The ones who keep their heads down, build and deliver (shout-out to 0x). Corporations who are tight-lipped about their stance on DLT, but are working like maniacs behind the scenes. Fortune 500 companies who are engaging in shiny innovation theater, but with no true intention to ever bring those PoC’s in-house.  Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, got it right: ​  “​There are new and evolving requirements for money, as well as essential public policy objectives. While the case for digital currency is not universal, we should investigate it further, seriously, carefully, and creatively.”​  I would echo those sentiments for the wider promise of DLT, because we are not there ​yet. But we might get there in 2019.  Have an opinionated take on 2018? CoinDesk is seeking submissions for our 2018 in Review. Email news [at] coindesk.com to learn how to get involved.

On a consolidated basis, GMO is to record an ""extraordinary loss"" of 35.5 billion yen (or $321.6 million), consisting of impairment loss and losses from transfers of receivables, which are worth approximately $104.2 million and $217.4 million, respectively, due to the sales of relevant assets.  The firm said in its statement:  ""After taking into consideration changes in the current business environment, the company expects that it is difficult to recover the carrying amounts of the in-house-mining-related business assets, and therefore, it has been decided to record an extraordinary loss.""  GMO first launched its miner making business in September 2017 and set up its in-house mining operations in northern Europe at the end of last year. The decision to quit its miner making business comes just months after GMO formally launched its B3 miner equipped with a 7nm mining chip.  The firm, however, said Tuesday that it will continue to run its in-house mining operations despite the current tough conditions, and is planning to review its revenue structure and relocate its mining center to a new region with “cleaner and less expensive” power resources.  “We are currently operating mining machines, and the depreciation cost will be almost zero after recognizing the impairment loss. Therefore, we will continue running mining operations if we can ensure that the revenue exceeds the electricity cost,” the firm explained in a conference call for institutional investors on Tuesday. However, it has not yet decided the full details of its new plans and whether that will help improve its profitability.  GMO’s crypto mining business reported a loss of 640 million yen (about $5.6 million) in Q3 2018, a further drop from its Q2 loss of 360 million yen (about $3.2 million). GMO said at the time that the poor performance was due to a worsening external environment and increasing depreciation costs.  Regarding GMO group's other businesses, including its crypto exchange business, the firm said in the conference call that it believes they have “high growth potential and will continue to position them as growing sectors” for its future growth strategy.
