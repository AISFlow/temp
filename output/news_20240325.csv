Crypto Analyst Weighs In As JUP Surges 13%,"Jupiter (JUP) has had a remarkable month, with its price skyrocketing over 150% in the last 30 days. Amid the crypto market slowdown and some controversies, JUP’s performance has maintained momentum. Related Reading: Solana Tokens Among Top Gainers: JUP and WEN Soar Over 12%, WIF Hits New ATH Crypto Analyst Sees “Decent” Entry Spot For JUP Jupiter’s JUP started the month trading around $0.63 and has seen the price jump 106% in 25 days. The token’s performance this month showed sideways price action before climbing to a new support level twice, which could suggest that another price surge is possible despite the turbulent week. In an X post, renowned crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa commented on JUP’s most recent performance as he wondered about the possibility of a leg up. $JUP: Wondering if next leg is coming for JUPITER…consolidation and looks ok + btc looks somewhat stable (for now). Might be a decent spot entry here. pic.twitter.com/uE8IHblbFY — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) March 25, 2024 The analyst shared JUP’s price chart, which displayed the token’s sideways movement inside the $1.12-$1.47 price range for the past few days. The chart shows that the consolidation phase started after the token’s price jumped and unsuccessfully tested the $1.50 resistance level on March 16. After a pullback to the $1.20 mark, JUP retested the resistance zone again on March 18, briefly reaching $1.60, but ultimately failed to maintain it. Following the unsuccessful attempts to climb, the price dipped even lower to the $1.10 support zone in the following days. Since then, JUP has bounced back, hovering between the $1.15-$1.25 zone. The recent price consolidation looks “ok,” according to the analyst. He further highlights Bitcoin’s current stability, seemingly suggesting to Sherpa that JUP could repeat its March trajectory. As a result, the analyst deems this moment as a “decent entry spot” for Jupiter’s token. Additionally, he has shown a positive sentiment towards JUP before, calling the token a “winner” that’s “gonna keep on winning.” winners gonna keep on winning. $PYTH and $JUP are some of the great ones. pic.twitter.com/nL4BmzxFJo — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) March 16, 2024 JUP’s Price Action Recently, JUP’s Community showed some concerns after its co-founder Meow announced a controversial decision. Meow revealed on X that Jupiter would donate the SLERF limit order and DCA fees to the token’s presale participants. This decision was taken without consulting the community, a crucial part of the project. After the criticism, Meow explained that “no JUP tokens were involved in the donation and, despite the turbulence in the community, JUP’s price didn’t seem to be affected.” It’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s price showed stabilization signs over the weekend, as highlighted by Sherpa. This matters as JUP followed BTC’s trajectory closely over the last week. As the chart below shows, the Solana-based token mimicked the moves of the flagship cryptocurrency. JUP and BTC's price performance over the last 7 days. Source: CoinGecko In the last 24 hours, Jupiter’s trading volume has surged 64.1%, with $214.7 million being traded. According to CoinMarketCap data, JUP’s market capitalization increased 8.5% in the past day, placing the token as the 65th largest cryptocurrency by this metric, with $1.77 billion. Despite the negative 3.5% performance in the past week, the token exhibits a significant 71.8% price jump in the biweekly timeframe.

Crypto Expert Predicts Where Price Is Headed Next","Crypto expert popularly known as KSI has shared his thoughts on how the Bitcoin price could progress until the peak of this bull cycle. Based on his prediction, the flagship crypto could experience significant dips on its way to a new all-time high of $100,000. $80,000 Could Be Next For Bitcoin KSI mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin could rise to between $73,000 and $80,000 from here. However, a correction could quickly follow, as the crypto analyst remarked that Bitcoin would drop to between $50,000 and $60,000 afterwards. KSI added that it would be a “boring red summer,” suggesting that BTC’s price won’t be encouraging during that period. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Notable Rise In Daily Activity, But Why Is Price Down? KSI claimed that things would then pick up again in the winter. He also stated that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the beginning of 2025 or even before the end of this year. With his prediction, KSI joins a list of analysts who have predicted that Bitcoin could hit the $100,000 mark before the year runs out. Tom Dunleavy, Partner and Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at MV Capital, previously stated that BTC would rise to that price level this year. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered initially predicted that Bitcoin would hit $100,000 by year-end before taking a more bullish stance and predicting that the flagship crypto would hit $150,000 by the end of 2024. What To Expect From BTC’s Price KSI’s prediction also echoes the sentiments of crypto analyst Rekt Capital. In a recent analysis, Rekt Capital mentioned that Bitcoin would enter a “multi-month re-accumulation” after the Bitcoin Halving, which could last up to five months. The crypto analyst noted that this period is usually characterized by Bitcoin’s tepid price movement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Go On Massive Buying Spree, Here’s How Much They’ve Bought Once that phase was over, Rekt Capital revealed that Bitcoin would break out from the re-accumulation area and make a parabolic move. This is said to be when BTC experiences “accelerated growth into a parabolic uptrend.” This phase lasts over a year, but Rekt Capital believes it may be cut in half in this market cycle with a “potential accelerated cycle occurring right now.” The accelerated cycle he refers to includes the fact that BTC hit a new all-time high (ATH) before the Bitcoin Halving. That has never happened in previous market cycles, raising the possibility of this bull market being largely different from past ones.

24797952,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599563,1711400408,Bitcoin Top In Yet? What The Legendary MVRV Ratio Says,"Here’s what the latest trend in the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio suggests about where the market is currently in terms of a top. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Has Seen A Decline To The 2.34 Level According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the BTC MVRV ratio surged high earlier this year as the cryptocurrency rally took place. The “MVRV ratio” is a popular indicator that tracks the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the realized cap. The former is simply the total valuation of the asset’s supply at the current spot price, while the latter is an on-chain capitalization model. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders & Price Top: Glassnode Reveals Pattern The realized cap measures the total sum of the value of the cryptocurrency’s supply, assuming that each coin in circulation has its true value at the price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain rather than the current spot value. One way to interpret the realized cap is that since it takes into account the buying price of every token in circulation (assuming that the last transaction of every token was indeed the point at which it last changed hands), it essentially sums up the total capital the investors have invested in the asset. As such, the MVRV ratio tells us how the total value that Bitcoin investors are carrying right now (that is, the market cap) compares against the value they put in (the realized cap). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV ratio over the past few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been turning down in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio has had a value greater than 1 for a while now. When the indicator has such values, the market cap is greater than the realized cap, and hence, the investors carry net profits. With the latest rally in the asset, this indicator has surged to relatively high levels, a natural consequence of the holders’ profits ballooning up with the price surge. After the recent drawdown in the price, though, the MVRV ratio has also turned itself around, as it’s now heading down. At present, the ratio has a value of around 2.34. “Traditionally, an MVRV ratio above 3 has been a reliable marker for predicting price peaks,” notes IntoTheBlock. So far, in the current rally, the metric hasn’t crossed this mark. It did come close recently, but the latest decline has meant it has gained a bit more distance to the level. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Halving May Not Result In Supply Squeeze: Glassnode Why have tops historically occurred at high values of the Bitcoin MVRV ratio? The answer is that investors in profits are more likely to participate in selling, and this temptation to take profits only increases as their gains grow larger. Because of this, selloffs are most probable when the market is holding extreme levels of profits, which is exactly what high MVRV ratio values reflect.

The SEC’s motion for judgment and remedies, filed on Friday, remains under seal to outside parties. According to Stuart Alderoty, Ripple Labs’ chief legal officer, redacted versions of the documents will be publicly available by Tuesday, March 26.  The judgment would bring an end to this phase of the multi-year legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC, which began in December 2020 when the SEC filed suit against the crypto firm and its executives, alleging that they violated federal securities laws by selling XRP to both institutional and retail customers.  When it was filed, the action led to the widespread delisting or trading suspension of XRP from U.S. exchanges. A federal judge ruled last year that Ripple violated federal securities laws in directly selling XRP to institutional investors, though not in selling XRP to retail investors through exchanges.  Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple Labs’ CEO, suggested in his X (formerly Twitter) post that the company will fight back against the proposed judgement motion.  ""The SEC plans to ask the Judge for $2B in a case that involved no allegations (let alone findings) of fraud or recklessness,"" Garlinghouse wrote. ""There is absolutely no precedent for this. We will continue to expose the SEC for what they are when we respond to this.""  Alderoty wrote that the company will file its response to the SEC’s motion next month, adding ""As we all have seen time and time again, this is a regulator that trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead … Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple – and the industry at large.

42408579,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gamM6f,1711397114,Is Nigeria Strong-Arming Binance?,"In late February, the Nigerian government let it be known that it thought $26 billion had illegally moved through Binance out of the country in 2023. This estimate was made by the country’s central bank governor, who said the nation was losing out on taxes from unregistered crypto activity.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  A few days later, authorities in the country invited two Binance executives — Tigran Gambaryan, who runs the exchange’s financial crime compliance, and Nadeem Anjarwalla, the company's regional manager in Africa — to the country to discuss the issue. The authorities reportedly demanded that they name Nigerians trading on their platform.  On Feb. 26, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were taken into custody, but not charged with any crimes. A court granted Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission's request to detain the two executives for 14 days, and, though they were scheduled to appear in court on April 4, the BBC reported Gambaryan and Anjarwalla continued detention was ""unlawful.""  The two were reportedly intercepted by national security officers after arriving in the country on the grounds that Binance operates illegally in Nigeria. A week before, the country moved to block access to multiple crypto platforms in a bid to strengthen foreign-exchange and capital controls on its crashing local currency, the naira.  Nigeria is facing a scarcity of dollars as the naira has fallen around 70% against the greenback since last year. Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Olayemi Cardoso named Binance directly during a press conference in late February, when he announced a record interest rate bump to stymie the naira’s free fall.  Whether Binance has contributed to Nigeria’s worsening economic picture is certainly up for debate, though, to the extent that authorities in the country are detaining mid-level executives, it seems Nigeria is looking to strong-arm the exchange and scapegoat its financial woes.  At this moment in time, Binance is something of an international pariah. The world’s largest exchange just recently agreed to pay a record $4.3 billion fine to the U.S. Department of Justice for “horrendous” crimes, including facilitating terrorist financing and the very worst things you can do online.  The exchange has been chased out of countless countries across the globe, and its founding CEO, the face of Binance for years, Changpeng Zhao, was ordered to step down and likely faces time in federal prison. In other words, it's unlikely that many international courts or better business bureaus would care if the exchange lived or died (this is made worse by the exchange resisting setting up a headquarters in any particular county).  It’s conceivable then that Nigeria sees Binance as something to extort, an easy mark that no embassy would defend, and that many are predisposed to believe likely did facilitate illicit transfers or tax evasion in the country. It’s worth noting that, although the Nigerian government moved to block access to other crypto platforms, seemingly only Binance is under fire.  In early March, Bayo Onanuga, an adviser to the Nigerian president, suggested the country could level a $10 billion fine against Binance, though he later said he was misquoted and that nothing was “finalized” yet. On Monday, the country finally got around to charging Binance with tax evasion.  Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service announced on Monday that Binance faces four charges of alleged non-payment of Value-Added Tax (VAT or sales tax) and company income tax, failure to submit tax returns and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through its platform.  Gambaryan and Anjarwalla (who has reportedly escaped custody) were identified as defendants in the case filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, the nation’s capital, the tax agency said. Reportedly, in their initial conversations, Nigerian authorities expressed two primary concerns about Binance: that it cannot trace the money that moves through the exchange, and that the exchange was putting pressure on the naira by facilitating trading on its peer-to-peer marketplace.  See also: Nigeria Charges Binance With Tax Evasion After Detained Exec Escapes  Binance halted all support for its peer-to-peer marketplace in Nigeria earlier in March due to the pressure from the country’s government. The service apparently grew in popularity in 2021 after former President Muhammadu Buharithe banned much crypto activity in the country. In July 2023, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission issued a warning about Binance, alleging that “any investing public dealing with this entity” was doing so at a “high level of risk” of losing their fund.  However it isn’t only Binance that the country is cracking down on. Bloomberg reported that the “anti-graft” officers had been arresting street currency traders and other supposedly unlicensed forex operators. This certainly adds context to Nigeria having asked Binance for information on its top 100 users in the country as well as the exchange’s last six months of transaction history.  Binance said around the time Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were arrested it had previously cooperated with Nigerian agencies, responding to 626 information requests from law enforcement over the last four years. A team even engaged in the anti-graft agency’s training sessions towards the end of last year.  See also: Binance Blocked by Philippines Securities Watchdog  Nigeria’s economic situation could certainly have been exacerbated by crypto. Bitcoin and stablecoins see above-average levels of adoption and use in countries facing inflation and economic turmoil for a reason: crypto is a way to opt out of a bad situation. That may be why, in December 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria lifted the ban for banks engaging in crypto and issued regulatory guidelines for virtual asset service providers. These would give authorities greater control over and insight into crypto usage.  However, many economists see a confluence of factors pummeling the naira. An already weak economy was made worse after President Bola Tinubu relaxed the country’s foreign exchange policies and cut the naira’s peg in a bid to attract foreign investment and diversify the oil-dependent nation’s economy. Investment, unfortunately, has been slow to come in (in fact, many foreign companies are leaving the country), and the naira has been on a monthslong decline.  It’s a bleak story. President Tinubu, who took office in May 2023, has vowed to support local businesses, invest in infrastructure and tackle the problem of jihadi terrorists cutting into Nigeria’s shipping. That crypto is also a national priority on par with pirating is an interesting signal for the entire crypto industry, whether legitimate or not.  Of course, Nigeria might do well to welcome the crypto industry to the country, which will help jumpstart a financial services industry and contribute to the national coffers. Notably, after Gambaryan and Anjarwalla’s arrest, a Binance spokesperson said that Nigeria was “not yet” one of its top markets, though the country, with a population of more than 200 million people, holds “extraordinary potential and we hope to continue to invest there.”  There is also nothing inherently wrong with going after a company that hasn’t paid its taxes or is operating out-of-sight of financial regulators. But, dear lord, take aim at the company, not middle-managers and executives with families.

24796369,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599583,1711396805,Bitcoin is “Overheating” For The First Time Ever Before Halving,"Bitcoin, the world’s most valuable coin, is once again deviating from historical norms. According to an analysis by one crypto analyst, the coin is in the “overbought” territory of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the first time in the lead-up to halving. The RSI is a popular technical indicator analysts use to gauge the price momentum of traded instruments. Bitcoin Overheating? RSI Stands Above 70 The analyst points out that the Bitcoin RSI on the monthly chart is currently above 70, indicating an overbought condition and overheating. This is a significant development as it’s the first time in Bitcoin’s history that this has happened before a halving. The Bitcoin network is set to halve miner rewards in mid-April. This event, which occurs roughly every 200,000 blocks, will cut rewards distributed to miners by 50% from the current level of 6.125 BTC. Miners play a vital role in confirming transactions and maintaining network security. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Real Pump’ Nears New All-Time Highs, Analyst Says The fact that Bitcoin prices appear to be “overheating” just before halving is net bullish for the coin. It suggests that prices are not only breaking from historical trends but also building strong momentum. Besides the strong upside momentum, the analyst notes that Bitcoin now trades above a critical dynamic level on the monthly chart. The confluence of these positive developments could explain why traders are upbeat. Most analysts agree that the coin will likely break higher in the weeks ahead, clearing the recent all-time high of around $73,800. BTC Pinned Below $73,000 And Consolidating Thus far, Bitcoin prices are firm, increasing as evident in the daily chart. After sharp contractions in the past few trading sessions, the welcomed reversal over the weekend lifted the coin towards the elusive $70,000 level and a previous all-time high. However, judging from the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, a break above $73,800 would likely catalyze more demand. So far, prices are moving sideways within a broad range despite signals of strength relayed from other indicators. Related Reading: Why Is The Price Of LUNC And USTC Up Today? While some investors are bullish, expecting prices to rise, caution should prevail. A close above $74,000 would thrust Bitcoin into unchartered territory. Beyond this, the analyst uses technical indicators to make projections. These tools use historical parameters and lag. As such, they may not be as accurate and, thus, misleading in some instances.

24794776,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599549,1711393246,7 Days Of Crypto: Key Events That You Should Keep An Eye On This Week,"There are a couple of events to watch out for this week, as they could prove pivotal in determining the future trajectory of the crypto market. These events could provide some certainty to the market or cause investors to wait on the sidelines for more favorable market conditions. Events That Could Affect The Market This Week Some Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak at different events this week. One of them is Governor Lisa Cook, who will give a lecture on March 25. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also participate in a discussion at the Monetary Policy Conference on March 29. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Bleed For One Week Straight – Can Price Recover To $73,000? Their speeches are significant as they could provide valuable insights into the current state of the economy and what to expect from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates in its fight against inflation. Macroeconomic factors like interest rates usually impact the crypto market and partly determine the sentiments among crypto traders. The crypto market is usually bullish whenever the Federal Reserve adopts a dovish stance on whether or not to hike interest rates. Therefore, these officials sounding positive in their speeches could help boost investors’ confidence in the crypto market since they would be less worried about things on the macro side. Meanwhile, several economic data will be released this week, including the Consumer Confidence and Consumer Sentiment data and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. These releases offer insights into the economy’s strength and guide the Fed in deciding on future interest rate decisions. Crypto Needs A Big Win This Week Stakeholders and investors in the industry will no doubt hope that the events lined up for this week will provide a momentum boost for the crypto market. Last week was one to forget as things cooled after weeks of seeing the flagship crypto, Bitcoin, and altcoins make significant runs. This downward trend is believed to have been due to some external factors. Related Reading: Bernstein Analysts Says Bitcoin Will Reach A New ATH By Year End, Here’s The Target One of them is the net outflows that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded throughout last week, with many investors taking profits from the various funds. These Bitcoin ETFs had previously seen an impressive amount of inflows into them, which positively affected Bitcoin’s price. As such, a trend of outflows was also expected to influence Bitcoin’s price, although negatively. These Spot Bitcoin ETFs will again be in the spotlight this week, with the crypto community waiting to see if the sentiments among the ETF investors will change. A sustained trend of profit-taking this week could spark another decline in the crypto market.

He proclaimed, “We are close to the biggest altseason in history. Everyone will make x50-x100 on their entire portfolio. $5k portfolio will be around $250k-$500k in 2025. All you need is to buy the right lowcaps.” This assertion hinges on a strategic selection of low market capitalization cryptocurrencies, which, according to Cyclop, are poised for an exponential surge in value. Cyclop elucidates his strategy by detailing the liquidity flow typically observed during a bull market phase, a sequential process starting with Bitcoin (BTC) and cascading down to meme coins. He explains, “Here is a typical bull run liquidity flow: 1: BTC pump 2: ETH pump 3: High cap alts pump 4: Low caps pump 5: Memecoin pump.” Importantly, he highlights that high cap memecoins have already experienced their growth phase, suggesting that “lowcap/lowcap memecoins – next” are primed for significant value appreciation. Related Reading: What is Macro/Crypto Summer? Don’t Miss Out, Says Expert Within this framework, Cyclop underscores the potential for staggering returns without the necessity for professional day trading expertise. “It’s cause each coin has its maximum, and if its MC is already high, it’s not so far away. But when the market cap is almost at zero, the potential is enormous,” he advises, promoting a hands-off investment strategy focused on the ‘right’ coins. Crypto Watchlist: Top-10 Lowcap Coins Cyclop’s watchlist is a selection of ten recently launched projects with low market caps and, in his view, substantial growth potential: #1 Wolf Wif (BALLZ): A meme coin that took the Solana blockchain by storm, achieving a $75 million market cap within a day of its launch. Despite a subsequent correction, Cyclop views this as an optimal entry point, confidently stating, “I’m holding my BALLZ tight.” #2 Entangle (NGL): Positioned as a potential leading messaging infrastructure for the Web3 space, Entangle aims to enhance liquidity within the ecosystem. It offers secure, flexible, and interoperable solutions for blockchain data communication, positioning itself as a critical infrastructure for dApps and builders. #3 StarHeroes (STAR): This esports-centric, multiplayer third-person space shooter game is making waves with its dynamic and competitive gameplay. Cyclop sees this as a revolutionary blend of gaming and blockchain technology, offering intense gaming emotions and a new avenue for esports within the crypto realm. #4 Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA): A blockchain strategy game that allows players to build bases, engage in battles for cryptocurrency rewards, and form partnerships with landowners. Cyclop highlights its potential in the play-to-earn space, marking it as a standout project. #5 VoluMint (VMINT): This project introduces a decentralized, AI-driven market-making service, aiming to redefine market-making in the era of blockchain. Cyclop is bullish on its ability to unlock the potential of crypto projects, emphasizing its innovative approach. #6 SatoshiVM (SAVM): As a decentralized Bitcoin ZK Rollup Layer 2 solution, SatoshiVM bridges the gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s EVM, using BTC as gas. This project aims to combine the value and security of Bitcoin with the programmability of Ethereum, creating a powerful ecosystem for decentralized applications. Cyclop notes, “SAVM’s unique positioning as a bridge between BTC and EVM ecosystems presents a groundbreaking opportunity for growth.” Related Reading: STX Brushes Off Sluggish Crypto Market As It Shoots Up By 30% #7 Graphlinq Chain (GLQ): Offering a no-code interface for automating blockchain tasks, Graphlinq Chain simplifies the creation and deployment of blockchain automations. Its suite of tools, including an IDE, App, Engine, and Marketplace, is designed to make blockchain automation accessible to a wider audience. “GraphLinq Protocol demystifies blockchain automation, paving the way for innovative applications and efficiencies,” Cyclop remarks. #8 zKML (ZKML): This project addresses the pressing need for privacy in digital transactions and communications. By combining zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and multi-party computation (MPC), zKML offers a secure and private framework for blockchain interactions. “ZKML’s focus on privacy-enhancing technologies is timely and critical, offering a secure haven for digital transactions,” observes Cyclop. #9 Monai (MONAI): Monai stands out for its development of uncensored generative AI tools, integrated with its blockchain, Monad. It features an advanced, unrestricted Large Language Model as its flagship product, aiming to revolutionize the way we interact with AI. “Monai’s pioneering approach to generative AI within the blockchain space is a game-changer, offering unparalleled possibilities,” Cyclop asserts. #10 EMC Protocol (EMC): Dedicated to AI applications, EMC Protocol is a blockchain network that includes a computing power consensus mechanism. It aims to facilitate the execution of AI tasks within a decentralized framework, including validator, smart router, and computing power nodes. “EMC’s innovative approach to integrating AI and blockchain could redefine the landscape of decentralized applications,” Cyclop concludes.

42408583,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gamMNC,1711389595,How to Improve Transparency and Public Trust in Crypto Markets,"Revelations last year involving fraud, money laundering, lies and deception by FTX, Binance and others have shaken the public’s trust in the digital assets industry – especially its trading platforms. Transparency and a strong commitment to investor protection are vital to earning back that trust.  Bruce Tupper is the president and founder of CoinRegTech, which provides compliance services to the digital asset market. Tyler Williams is the head of regulatory and legislative affairs and regulatory counsel for Galaxy, a financial services and investment management innovator in the digital asset and blockchain technology sectors.  We believe two proposals – Proof of Reserves Reporting and Off-Chain Transaction Reporting – are prudent requirements for trading platforms to implement. Both proposals would immediately improve transparency to protect customer funds. More is necessary, but let’s not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  It is past time for the U.S. Congress to move forward with comprehensive digital asset legislation. Two recent bills are noteworthy. First, S. 3087, The PROOF Act, introduced by Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and John Hickenlooper (D-CO) in October 2023, would require trading platforms to cryptographically prove monthly that they can honor all customer deposits held in custody.  Second, H.R. 5966, the Off-Chain Digital Commodity Transaction Reporting Act, introduced by Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA), also in October 2023, would improve transparency and customer protection by requiring trading platforms to report all digital commodity transactions (such as Bitcoin and Ether) to a trade repository licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This reporting requirement is comparable to what applies to swaps transactions today.  These legislative efforts are novel in using blockchain technology’s noteworthy public transparency and auditability functionality. Blockchains track debits and credits to accounts on a ledger, just like an ordinary accounting system, but in a real-time, transparent, and immutable fashion. The existence of any asset that resides on a public blockchain, whether a tokenized security or a digital commodity, is verifiable by customers and regulators. This is not the case for off-chain transactions, which don’t commit digital asset transactions to the appropriate blockchain. Instead, records of off-chain transactions are stored in the trading platform’s internal systems and not recorded on the blockchain. As a result, customers rely on the internal recordkeeping of unregistered trading platforms to track their record of ownership.  Now, trading platforms and lawmakers are coalescing around a simple idea: What if trading platforms that act as custodians could indisputably prove control over customer assets? This is known as a Proof of Reserve (PoR). This evolving concept has existed in the digital asset markets for about a decade. PoR involves a trading platform acting as a custodian to attest to their customer assets by committing all these assets to a public ledge (on-chain). By publishing these datasets, customers and regulators could verify assets, and assure trading platforms are sound.  Legislative initiatives have focused on mandating trading platforms to segregate client assets from the operational funds of trading platforms. The goal is to provide customers and regulators with assurances in the case of a trading platform liquidation or bankruptcy while protecting customer assets. Some trading platforms have voluntarily adopted monthly PoR attestations. PoR should be part of any comprehensive legislative solution adopted by the US Congress, which is precisely what Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) recognized when they reintroduced the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act, S. 2281, which included a specific provision that would require crypto intermediaries to maintain PoR and undergo annual verifications. If blockchain technology were broadly implemented across our financial services industry, markets and financial services would be more transparent and less costly.  The other “must have” is Rep. Beyer’s proposal (HR 5966) requiring trading platforms to report off-chain and on-chain transactions to a CFTC trade repository, similar to how the agency already collects and oversees swaps markets. While on-chain transactions are already recorded on their respective blockchains, this bill would standardize and gather that data, along with off-chain transactions, to offer customers transparency and confidence in trading platforms and the digital asset market generally. The Beyer bill would permit a registered trade repository to share transaction data with the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The reporting requirement would also assist regulators in monitoring the trading platforms and other market participants.  Some lawmakers in Washington have taken a very negative view of these transparency proposals. In some cases, lawmakers have sought to stymie the digital asset industry by blocking access to accounting services. In a Januaryletter to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), lawmakers attacked PoR and called it a “sham audit.” The PCAOB duly released an advisory letter warning investors about PoR attestations. As a result, audit firms have pulled back from engagements, and the PCAOB’s stance is the opposite of what a reasonable accounting regulator should do.  The major criticisms of PoR have largely been addressed in S. 3087 the Proof Act. PoR is not contemplated as a substitute for standard audits, but rather to complement standard audit practices. Traditional audit assurance is necessary, but it is no substitute for high-frequency and publicly verifiable proof that customer funds are present with the trading platform that is also acting as a custodian.  Trading platforms shouldn’t be held to a different standard from traditional custodians and registered exchanges. Frequent PoR attestations could provide more transparency than traditional custodians currently offer. The reporting of both on-chain and off-chain digital asset transactions to a CFTC-registered trade repository – a kind of “trust, but verify” approach – offers an additional layer of federal oversight and protection for customers.  The digital asset industry is putting forward good faith and reasonable approaches in the form of PoR and Off-Chain Transaction Reporting. More may be necessary. We ask simply that Washington politicians and regulators work with us. The Digital Asset industry is turning a page and working hard to gain back the trust lost by customers and policymakers.  With the advancement of the PoR and Off-Chain bills in connection with comprehensive digital asset legislation, trading platforms and blockchain technology will have the opportunity to flourish and underpin a new era of American-led financial innovation and exceptionalism. This is a worthy goal and one that Washington D.C. should support.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Bruce Tupper, Tyler Williams",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/03/25/how-to-improve-transparency-and-public-trust-in-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2e06baf2542c3487899f6e6770d78bac288a47e-4288x2848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin For A Massive Leg Up To $100,000 In his analysis, Doctor Profit explores the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), psychological analysis, and technical analysis (TA) of Bitcoin’s recent performance. Drawing attention to the previous Sunday report, the analyst predicted a sideways movement for Bitcoin in the longer term. However, the largest cryptocurrency asset is currently moving in the indicated sideways region, as he points out. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Real Pump’ Nears New All-Time Highs, Analyst Says The expert claims that some people are unable to see the wider picture playing out within the sideways movement. Due to this, they fail to understand that price fluctuations in the 20% range are normal and even beneficial for moves in big market caps. Thus, Bitcoin is preparing for its next big move, which will push prices over $80,000 and hit $100,000 at high speed. He noted that this bullish sideways movement is referred to as an accumulation area in trading terminology. During this stage, a convergence of profit-taking, incoming investment, and undecided money, practically leads to a mid-term consolidation. Consequently, he is bullish about the sideways trend and anticipates a looming upward surge. Furthermore, Doctor Profit underscored the significance of Bitcoin’s recent breakout above its previous all-time high (ATH) of $69,000, and the necessity of exercising patience as the coin consolidates close to its peak level. He stated: What many fail to understand is that Bitcoin just broke through its all-time high (ATH) in the last few weeks and is now slowly building support near the ATH region. People don’t realize that this is a process that takes weeks. Doctor Profit asserts that before continuing to rise and entering the super cycle, the market would spend weeks in the area of the Golden Bull. “After confirmation at $72,500, it won’t be long until BTC rises beyond $70,000 and enters the super cycle,” he added. Recent Retest Pattern Aligns With Past Trends Doctor Profit seems to be pleased with Bitcoin retesting its previous ATH level in the $60,000 range. He highlights the potential of Bitcoin and the slow transformation of the $60,000 resistance level into a solid support point, paving the way for the upcoming super cycle similar to other ATH breakouts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pre-Halving Dip Expected: Will BTC Rally Before US Fed Decision? “Bitcoin now appears mature enough to withstand this pressure at $60,000 and maintain its above-average price without any difficulty,” he stated. Despite ongoing corrections, the analyst has urged investors to be confident, citing the Bitcoin Halving as a catalyst for an impending upward surge.

TRI holders will be able to stake the token to earn a yield from borrowing fees.  The offering comes as DeFi activity and demand for leverage picked up amid the current crypto bull market.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) lender TrueFi unveiled plans Monday to start a real-world-asset-based (RWA) lending platform called Trinity to boost utility for its tokenized U.S. Treasury offering.  Trinity will let users take out crypto loans using tokenized RWAs as collateral. TrueFi's Treasury bill token (tfBILL) will be the first, with plans to add other yield-generating tokenized products in the future, according to a TrueFi governance proposal by ecosystem developer organization Wallfacer Labs.  Investors will be able to borrow the platform's TRI token by pledging the tfBILL tokens, using the borrowed crypto to create DeFi strategies to earn up to 15% annualized yield, the proposal said. Investors will also be able to buy TRI tokens on secondary markets such as decentralized exchanges, and stake them to earn a yield from the platform's borrowing fees.  The proposal to launch Trinity is pending approval by the TrueFi decentralized autonomous organization.  The proposed new platform follows a resurgence in DeFi activity in recent months, with crypto-native yields and demand for leverage rapidly increasing amid the roaring digital asset bull market. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the most liquid crypto tokens, has risen almost 50% since the start of the year.  TrueFi was a key lender during the previous crypto bull cycle, originating over $1.5 billion of undercollateralized loans mainly to trading firms and market makers. As crypto prices cratered in 2022 with multiple firms imploding, some borrowers failed to repay their loans and depositors fled. The protocol's total value locked dropped to $20 million by the end of 2022 from a peak of over $900 million in 2021.  Last year, TrueFi introduced the tokenized U.S. Treasury offering, which had recently attracted $8.7 million of deposits.

42408584,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gamMQV,1711385539,Why the Media Is Seemingly Less Interested in Bitcoin Than Ever,"I. He was a crook  In May 2021, I interviewed Sam Bankman-Fried and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez together as part of a virtual crypto summit. Miami had gone all in becoming a crypto-friendly city, and the hallmark of that push was the Miami Heat making FTX its “official and exclusive cryptocurrency exchange partner,” a sponsorship that included stadium naming rights and was reportedly worth $135 million over 19 years.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. Daniel Roberts is the former editor in chief of Decrypt, and before that spent more than five years at Yahoo Finance and more than five years at Fortune.  It was the length of the deal that befuddled me: How could a company that had only existed for two years (FTX launched in May 2019) sign a 19-year basketball stadium naming rights commitment? How could the National Basketball Association, famously cautious about its corporate partners, feel confident this crypto exchange that appeared out of nowhere would still be around in 2040?  I asked SBF. He grinned and said, “It's a good question. Without going into the details, it's been a pretty good year for us. To the point where, frankly, we don't need to rely on the other 18 years to have the funds for this.” They could pay the full contract upfront, was his point. I couldn’t argue with that, and didn’t. I smiled like an idiot and moved on; what else was there to say? As we all know, FTX filed for bankruptcy just 18 months later.  The company’s rise always felt unsettling; its ascendancy caused some unspoken vertigo. For those of us who had been covering the industry for years, we had long known the major companies extremely well: Coinbase, DCG, Grayscale, Gemini, Circle, to name a few. FTX appeared out of thin air, founded by a supposed whiz kid trader from Jane Street.  Even saying that it launched in 2019 doesn’t adequately convey how sudden its arrival was: no one was talking about FTX until 2021, when, at peak crypto market mania, it raised $1.8 billion from venture capitalists, rabid with FOMO, at outlandish pace: $1 billion in July 2021 (Series B), then $420.69 million in October 2021 (we should have known from that choice of number it was not a real company), then $400 million in January 2022; not to mention another $400 million for the “separate” FTX.US business the same month. That’s $2.2 billion raised in six months.  I would interview SBF twice more, in January and August 2022. I was in the Bahamas in April 2022 at the circus-like FTX confab in partnership with Anthony Scaramucci’s SALT conference. It’s difficult to convey how surreal that event was. Andrew Yang and Katy Perry showed up to party and meet Sam. Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen were all speakers, but their onstage panels were strictly “off the record,” a ridiculous condition (at an otherwise fully on-the-record conference) that no journalists present should have respected — and yet we all did.  Through it all, I and many others in crypto media had the sense that something here was very wrong. That’s not to say we called it or caught it. I’m not in the camp that blames the media for SBF’s celebrity (mostly he bought his stardom with marketing). But I do think we all shared the same vague feeling of dread when legacy magazine covers crowned him “the next Warren Buffett.”  See also: Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto? | Opinion  Even after the collapse of the exchange, when SBF was first arrested and charged, my opinion was that he was not a conscious criminal, but that he got in way over his head and didn’t have the wherewithal to manage the situation. That was not to excuse him or the unconscionably bad management of a company that held billions in customer funds, but my presumption was incompetence more than Madoff-level malicious intent.  The document that prosecutors appended last week to back up their demand for a 40-50 year sentence puts an end to any remaining delusions. It is a document so transparently venal that it reveals SBF to be a person with no beliefs, no convictions, nothing but vacuous greed.  His list of “ideas” to save his image included: go on Tucker Carlson to “come out as a Republican” (after donating millions to Democrats in 2022) and “come out against the woke agenda”; blame FTX’s lawyers and/or lawyers in general for “throwing entrepreneurs under the bus”; blame the people handling the Chapter 11 process and say they’re standing in the way of customers getting their money back; praise the people handling the Chapter 11 process and say that thanks to them, customers will get their money back; blame Alameda (his hedge fund that was using FTX as its piggy bank); do an interview on ABC with his biographer Michael Lewis; or “send out a Twitter poll asking people what to do.”  It’s the biggest news event to ever happen in the crypto industry, and it was extremely deleterious to the image of what was supposed to be a revolutionary technology ...  I’m almost surprised not to see “blame my parents” on the list. The environmentalism was a front. The effective altruism was a front. Advocating for crypto in Washington was a front. He believes in nothing. To quote Hunter S. Thompson’s immortal obituary of Dick Nixon, ""he was a crook."" He was the most insidious crook the cryptocurrency industry has ever had, which is saying a lot, and he did more damage to the public perception of crypto than any other individual, and it isn’t close.  And yet. Bitcoin {{BTC}} soared to new all-time-highs just 15 months after the highest-profile black eye the crypto industry has ever seen. That is remarkable, and it’s something that, it seems to me, the broader mainstream media has been mostly uninterested in covering.  II. Narrative gazing  I first wrote about Bitcoin in 2011 for Fortune.com, and ever since have been most fascinated by the reputation and public perception of Bitcoin and crypto culture.  The news peg for my story was that Gawker (R.I.P.) had just run a great exposé about Silk Road (quite a headline: ""The Underground Website Where You Can Buy Any Drug Imaginable"") and as part of it, explained that the currency of Silk Road was bitcoin, which was “purportedly untraceable.” (Not quite right, but describing the tech precisely right was not always easy at the time.) The Gawker story prompted Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer (NY) and Joe Manchin (WV) to write Attorney General Eric Holder a letter demanding a crackdown on Silk Road and bitcoin, which they called “a form of money laundering.”  There weren’t many journalists covering cryptocurrency at that time. All of us in this small, weird pond have seen many market cycles and accompanying narratives, and it seems to me that, after 15 years, not much has changed.  The first big bitcoin bull run was in 2013, when it first topped $1,000, then tanked after the collapse of early exchange Mt Gox. But it was still relatively obscure until the 2017 rally that made it a topic of conversation at the Thanksgiving dinner table that year, when crypto truly broke into the mainstream consciousness. Legacy media orgs assigned full-time beat reporters to cover this opaque fintech topic that was gaining interest from normies, fueled by the initial coin offering (ICO) boom (paging Floyd Mayweather, DJ Khaled, Kim Kardashian and the many other celebs that hawked token sales). Then another crash.  Then came the pandemic rally, in 2021, when crypto mania truly set in, inextricably tied up with the retail investor revolution, WallStreetBets and GameStop, stonks, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and memes. Investing became a public social activity for the very-online. Then another crash. And now the current rally, in which bitcoin has soared above $72,000, driven by the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) and institutional adoption from big suits like BlackRock and Fidelity. Of course, with crypto it’s never just one thing driving it, and the current rally is not just about the ETF, but I suspect it will be most easily remembered and characterized that way.  Through it all, entrepreneurs have built legitimate companies, and picks-and-shovels tools and services, that form the backbone of a bustling tech category. But among the general public, the narratives have gone something like this, with little change over 15 years: bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme or vaguely scammy, a tool mostly used by hackers and fraudsters. Or it’s killing the environment by gobbling up electricity. Or at best, it is unserious. It annoys people. It annoyed them well before FTX rose and fell. Remember all the Super Bowl ads? Matt Damon saying “fortune favors the brave”? Bros with their “HODL” shirts and Lambos? Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton holding up cutouts of their Bored Apes on primetime television?  See also: If You're in Crypto, You're a Criminal | Opinion  But FTX took things to a new level with massive billboards of Bankman-Fried and Bundchen, an FTX patch on every baseball umpire’s shirt, an FTX logo on race cars and NBA arenas. It marketed so aggressively that it wormed its way into the public’s consciousness — and then it went under. It’s the biggest news event to ever happen in the crypto industry, and it was extremely deleterious to the image of what was supposed to be a revolutionary technology, a new payment rails, not a cultural lightning rod.  And it took just 15 months to return to all-time-highs.  As for mainstream media, and broadcast news in particular, they mostly only cover it when the price is surging or tanking. That has been true since the 2017 run, and with some exceptions here and there, it’s still true today. And now, in the midst of a new bull run, they seem less interested than ever. The defining forces are major financial institutions rather than Elon Musk pumping dogecoin {{DOGE}} on SNL. Sure, memecoins with names like BONK and dogwifhat (WIF) and Jeo Boden have pumped too, but for the most part, the 2024 bull run lacks the carnival barkers.  Perhaps this is a positive indicator. Perhaps — call this spin if you must — crypto is less of an oddity than ever before. Perhaps crypto is finally growing up.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Roberts,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/03/25/why-the-media-is-seemingly-less-interested-in-bitcoin-than-ever,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98afc00f7d702dd46d4c36009c11cf9dceaf0852-1632x918.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Friday court filings, the top buyer is ATIC Third International Investment Company, a tech investment company wholly owned by the government of Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala. ATIC has agreed to purchase 16,664,167 shares of Anthropic from FTX for $500 million.  Other buyers include Jane Street Global Trading – an affiliate of the erstwhile employer of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried – ""certain funds"" tied to Fidelity Investments and The Ford Foundation.

FTX's FTT token climbed 10% on the news.  FTX and Alameda paid $500 million for the 8% stake in Anthropic in 2021.

Altcoins fared better last week, with $16 million of net inflows – notably into polkadot, avalanche and litecoin.  Digital asset investment products witnessed record weekly outflows last week after billions piled into the vehicles over the past few months.  Led by $2 billion in exits from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), last week’s crypto fund outflows totaled $942 million, according to CoinShares. This broke what had been a record seven-week string of inflows of $12.3 billion.  Last week's outflow came alongside downside volatility in the price of bitcoin {{BTC}}, which tumbled below $61,000 from $73,000 just days earlier.  “We believe the recent price correction led to hesitancy from investors, leading to much lower inflows into new ETF issuers in the U.S., which saw $1.1 billion inflows,” said CoinShares. “Partially offsetting incumbent Grayscale’s significant $2 billion outflows last week.”  A Coinbase research report echoed CoinShares’ take, saying that the driver behind the surge in outflows was GBTC, noting one source of potential selling pressure from the bankruptcy estate of Genesis Global, which holds tens of millions of shares in the fund.

These massive transfers appear to have piqued the interest of a few investors who are keeping a watchful eye, as this accumulation pattern points to a price increase up ahead. According to various posts by whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts, Bitcoin whales have recently transferred $2.3 billion worth of BTC in a span of 24 hours, indicating their bullish sentiment. Similarly, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently revealed that over 25,000 BTC worth approximately $1.60 billion had been transferred into accumulation addresses. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Signal Price Surge Ahead Bitcoin has largely traded below $69,000 since March 15, struggling to regain the momentum that saw it shooting past $70,000 earlier in the month. Interestingly, Bitcoin fell to as low as $61,766 last week, representing a 16% decline from its all-time high. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Go On Massive Buying Spree, Here’s How Much They’ve Bought Meanwhile, Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw consistent outflows throughout the week which was spearheaded by Grayscale’s GBTC and weak inflows into BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. This decline became much of a concern for investors as it signaled the bullish sentiment surrounding BTC might finally be coming to an end. However, on-chain data is now telling a different tale of a strong bullish sentiment from Bitcoin whales. Data from Whale Alerts show large amounts of BTC leaving crypto exchanges, one of which was a transfer of 8,136 BTC worth $517 million from Coinbase into a new private wallet. Shortly after, 8,172 BTC worth $519 million were transferred from Coinbase into another new private wallet. Interestingly, the different alerts from the whale tracker added up to $2.3 billion worth of BTC to and from crypto exchanges on March 22. Analyst Ali Martinez noted that these transfers added up to $1.6 billion being added into accumulation addresses, the largest inflow so far this year. Yesterday, over 25,000 #Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1.60 billion, were transferred to accumulation addresses, marking the highest inflow to these $BTC wallets so far this year! pic.twitter.com/mAIHkG9ROC — Ali (@ali_charts) March 23, 2024 According to CryptoQuant data, this accumulation trend has seen the Bitcoin reserves on exchanges on a downtrend since March 21. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin exchange reserve is at 1.98 million BTC. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Notable Rise In Daily Activity, But Why Is Price Down? Basically, whale accumulation tends to swing the balance into bullish among other traders. Fundamentals surrounding Bitcoin like the upcoming halving point to price growth in the near future, making it an ideal time for investors to position themselves in the market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,478. A key price level to watch is $69,000. If Bitcoin breaks above this resistance level, it could continue surging higher with the accumulation trend.

Both countries want to try Kwon on criminal charges, including fraud, tied to the $40 billion collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022. After the Terra implosion, Kwon spent months on the lam before eventually being arrested in Montenegro for attempting to use fake Costa Rican travel documents en route to Dubai.  Kwon was initially given a four-month sentence for his crime, but remained in Montenegrin prison until his release on Saturday. According to local media reports, Kwon has been released to a shelter for foreigners and has had his real passport confiscated to prevent him from leaving the country. Kwon is expected to ask the court for permission to remain at large in the country until a decision on his extradition is reached, local media reported.  While he was in custody, Kwon and his lawyers fought extradition efforts by challenging court decisions, but his eventual extradition to South Korea seemed certain earlier this month when an appellate court confirmed a lower court’s decision to send him back to his native country to face charges.  That decision was upended last week, when Montenegro’s top prosecutor intervened and asked the country’s Supreme Court to overrule the decision and stay Kwon’s extradition. The Supreme Court complied and is currently weighing the two competing requests. No timeline on a decision has been given.  Civil fraud trial kicks off in New York  Kwon’s extended stay in Montenegro has not stopped the cases against him from moving forward.  A civil fraud trial brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Kwon and Terraform Labs kicked off in New York on Monday. The SEC has accused Kwon and Terraform Labs of lying to investors about the stability of Terra, their “algorithmic stablecoin,” and deceiving investors about the integration of the Terra blockchain into a Korean mobile payment app.  Kwon also faces criminal charges in New York, as well as in South Korea.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LUNA | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/25/do-kwon-released-from-montenegrin-prison-on-bail-terraform-labs-civil-trial-begins-in-nyc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0842047b3f634d88eabfba21f42c3b4c1caa0725-1201x676.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

24788172,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599510,1711378818,Bitcoin Retests Resistance: Here’s The Level A Break Could Lead To,"Data shows Bitcoin is currently retesting a major on-chain resistance level, and a break above which can potentially lead to a surge in its price. Bitcoin Has Major On-Chain Resistance Around $67,000 As pointed out by analyst Ali in a post on X, BTC may be able to see a rise towards the $72,900 level if the asset can break the current on-chain resistance barrier. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders & Price Top: Glassnode Reveals Pattern In on-chain analysis, any level’s potential to act as support or resistance is measured using the amount of Bitcoin that was acquired/bought by the investors around said level. The analyst has shared the chart for the “UTXO Realized Price Distribution” (URPD) indicator from Glassnode, that reveals how the various levels around the current spot value of BTC are looking like right now based on the density of supply that was last bought at them. Looks like there is significant resistance coming up ahead at the $72,900 mark | Source: @ali_charts on X The URPD here is “ATH partitioned,” which means that the price ranges here are defined by dividing the levels between zero and the current all-time high (ATH) into 100 equal partitions. From the chart, it’s visible that the partition around the $66,990 level carries the cost basis of a notable amount of the supply right now (1.3%). This also happens to be the range BTC is retesting at the moment. Generally, the cost basis is a special level for investors, and thus, they tend to be more likely to show some reaction when a retest takes place. If a large number of holders share their cost basis inside the same narrow range, then this reaction may result in a scale that could be relevant for the market. As for what direction this reaction from the holders would be probable to happen depends on the side the retest is happening from. A retest from under (meaning that these holders had been in loss prior to the retest) could lead to a selling reaction in the market. This is because these investors may not want to risk the cryptocurrency declining again in the future, so exiting while they have the opportunity to at their break-even might be tempting. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Halving May Not Result In Supply Squeeze: Glassnode As such, retests like these can lead to the asset feeling some degree of resistance. In the current case, the range is notably filled up with coins, so it’s possible that the strength of this resistance would be just as powerful. From the chart, it’s visible that after this range, the asset potentially faces no strong on-chain resistance barriers until the $72,879 level, which hosts the cost basis of about 1.61% of the supply. “If Bitcoin can break past $66,990, it will likely rise toward $72,880!” says Ali. BTC Price Bitcoin has been climbing up in the past day, with its price now reaching the $67,200 level. Should this surge be sustained, the asset would be through the current resistance block.

The rally didn't trigger mass short liquidations, suggesting there weren't many market participants using leverage to bet on falling prices.  Bitcoin could reach $83,000 after breaking upwards from its consolidation pattern, 10x Research said.  Cryptocurrencies started the week with a strong rally, bouncing back from recent losses as bitcoin {{BTC}} once again traded above its 2021 peak.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} surged past $70,000 on Monday during U.S. trading hours, surpassing the level for the first time in 10 days and gaining more than 7% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} was up 6% during the same period, while tokens for major layer-1 blockchains Solana {{SOL}} and Avalanche {{AVAX}} advanced more than 10%.  The rally extended to virtually all digital assets, with all constituents of the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) being in the green and the gauge up 6.1% for the day.  The sudden resurgence liquidated $195 million of leveraged derivatives positions across all crypto assets, some $129 million of them being short positions seeking to profit from lower prices, CoinGlass data shows. Bitcoin short liquidations reached $53 million, less than the average daily figure of the recent period.  The relatively modest amount of short liquidations despite the price surge suggests there weren't many market participants using leverage to bet on continued weakness.  Bitcoin targets $83,000 and higher after breaking out from consolidation pattern  Monday's surge signaled a potential end of the recent correction for crypto markets, which saw BTC drop below $61,000 last week from record prices above $73,000, coupled with tepid inflows to new U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs and increased selling of Grayscale's GBTC fund.  Bitcoin could target new all-time highs after breaking out to the upside from its consolidation pattern, analytics firm 10x Research said in a Monday report. Based on a symmetrical triangle formation, a chart pattern in technical analysis, the breakout could foreshadow a $15,000 to $20,000 price increase for bitcoin's next move from around the $63,000 level, the report said. That would drive BTC as high as $83,000.  Another critical level that BTC cleared today was the 2021 peak at $68,000, given that when previous market cycle tops were ""retested and broken once more, BTC has tended to put in significant rallies,"" said Markus Thielen, founder of 10x.  The uptrend is supported by several central banks tilting toward dovish stances, which should benefit bitcoin, the report said.  ""The Fed signaled that they are willing to accept higher inflation for longer and are eager to slow down quantitative tightening,"" Thielen said. ""The Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank also surprised on the dovish side.""  The report highlighted that bitcoin tends to perform well during U.S. election years – and 2024 is one – historically advancing 100%-200%, which also supports the case for higher prices later this year.  ""Our upside targets of $83,000 and $102,000 could slowly be at play,"" Thielen said.

42408576,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gamM3M,1711375960,How Bitcoin Mining Has Changed Since the Last Halving,"Every four years, we experience a bonus day in February, the United States elects a president (ideally one supportive of Bitcoin), the Olympics take place, and we witness a significant event called the Bitcoin halving.  In the grand scheme of things, four years may seem relatively short. However, in the realm of Bitcoin mining, where changes in the geographical landscape, hash rate growth, and industry efficiency are big factors, a lot has occurred since the previous halving event.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. Amanda Fabiano, former head of mining at Galaxy Digital, is the founder of Fabiano Consulting, which assists the Bitcoin mining industry in accomplishing its goals. She is also a speaker at this year's Consensus Festival in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  In 2020, we experienced the last halving during the height of the COVID lockdown, when many of my mining friends celebrated this epic occasion from afar, with hopes of celebrating IRL in four years.  At that time, the price of Bitcoin hovered around $8,700, while the hash rate stood at approximately 120 EH/s. The majority of the hash rate was concentrated in China, and rumors regarding the possibility of a Chinese ban were merely rumors.  Today, we’re nearing the upcoming halving, with Bitcoin price and hash rate reaching unprecedented levels. It’s challenging to envision the landscape for the next halving in 2028.  Since the last halving, the exodus of China miners drastically changed the mining landscape. Miners have sought refuge in jurisdictions offering hospitality or opportunities for energy arbitrage, which became a pivotal metric for success. Several nation states, such as Bhutan, El Salvador, and even Venezuela for a short period, not only embraced miners but also devised strategies to set up mining operations themselves. Not all places that opened their arms to miners ended up being great locations, including Quebec, Canada and Kazakhstan.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is a ‘Show Me the Money’ Moment for Miners  Texas emerged as a dominant mining hub, while Latin America and the Middle East saw growing interest and involvement in the mining sector.  Going forward, the surge in hash rate across the Middle East and Africa will continue and, based on announcements from the U.S.-listed companies, there is likely to be an increase of hash rate across North America. Miners will follow the cheapest forms of energy in jurisdictions that are economical and collaborative.  Maybe we will even experience hash rate seasonality again–this round unfolding in ERCOT markets versus rainy seasons in China.  Another major trend over the past cycle was the increase in institutional adoption. The long-awaited approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. played a significant role in legitimizing Bitcoin as an asset class within mainstream financial markets. The ETFs provided institutional investors with a regulated and accessible avenue to invest in Bitcoin, thereby forcing regulatory authorities and traditional financial institutions to seriously take a look at Bitcoin. While the ETF was having its moment, we can’t forget that public miners were there for institutional investors to invest in as an alternative to holding Bitcoin.  Over the last four years, the proliferation of public miners has been massive.  In 2020, there were only two public miners listed on the NASDAQ. By 2024, it’s hard to keep track of how many public miners there are across multiple exchanges across the world, with the NASDAQ being the dominant boasting at least 25 public miners.  The increase in miners publicly reporting their operations metrics to the markets shed light on issues, such as ASIC costs, hash rate expansion, operational challenges and cost to mine. Additionally, it facilitated an understanding of macro trends like global hash rate distribution, while providing analysts the ability to have a more methodical understanding of the overall cost curve of mining. Keep in mind that the public miners still account for around one-third of the overall network.  Unfortunately, while public companies enabled analysts to provide better coverage, this transparency also introduced greater complexity for analysts operating in the field since there are not standardized metrics. For instance, among a sample of eight public miners, a total of twenty different metrics are disclosed, some where the inputs don’t match.  The absence of standardized basic metrics complicates comparing one miner to another and providing comprehensive coverage. Miners have very different strategies: some host, some own infrastructure and provide services, some have PPA that allow for massive power revenue but lower Bitcoin production, some are working on different forms of compute. How do we bucket everyone as a Bitcoin miner while discounting their strategies?  Going forward, two main focus areas that will become increasingly important for miners–SG&A costs & operational excellence. Tying standardized metrics to miners will increase the next wave of transparency for investors to be able to properly evaluate which miner is their top pick. Hopefully we will see that emerge in this cycle.  Luckily, mining facilities now have a broader array of options for operational excellence—we have witnessed numerous mining support companies expand their service offerings to include firmware and fleet management solutions. These solutions provide adaptable logic that accommodates various mining strategies.  What does the rise in institutional adoption mean for private miners and the small guys? Raising capital for mining remains challenging, primarily due to the upfront capital requirements. Despite the current shift towards a bullish market which usually redefines risk management, the accessibility of options such as ETFs and public mining companies diminishes the appeal of investing in private miners. The lack of liquidity and the concentration of risk solely on operations deter potential investors.  The game is no longer about being on the low end of the cost curve, a miner must be on the low end of the cost curve and not only have access to capital but a low cost of capital.  However, there are always exceptions and there are some resilient and gritty builders in the mining industry. Private miners with exceptional growth strategies during bear markets as well as energy companies exploring alternative energy sources stand out as promising prospects worth monitoring. Additionally, because of the increased legitimacy of Bitcoin with the ETF, we might just see larger energy companies regain trust and be more open this cycle.  As block subsidies become scarcer, the importance of strategy and economies of scale intensifies, leading us to an increased activity in M&A. The landscape of miners, both public and private, might look very different in one year’s time. This trend began during the last bear market as some miners confronted challenging financial circumstances that others could scoop up. Additionally, this strategy acted as a response to a change in miners’ tolerance for counterparty risk. The previous cycle provided valuable lessons for the whole industry on counterparty risk.  M&A isn’t the only solution miner’s have turned to. We have seen the shift begin in the last cycle for a diversification in revenue, some shifting to positioning as energy companies or shifting to offer compute solutions. Vertical integration and diversification across business lines serve as crucial survival tactics for companies facing the harsh realities brought about by halving events.  Lastly, we can’t talk about the halving without thinking about the future state of revenue. With the launch of new L2 solutions for Bitcoin, the recent increase in network fees for miners have certainly been a welcome relief. This surge in activity has sparked both excitement and frustration within the industry.  The increase in fees helps a miner’s bottom lines. Miners are fundamentally profit-driven enterprises, particularly those publicly traded with shareholders, and their primary focus should remain on maximizing profitability, decreasing expenses and increasing operational excellence.  As we approach the mid-April halving, the landscape is so different from the lead-up to the previous event. Bitcoin’s price is flirting with all-time highs, and the hash rate has surpassed 600 EH/s. Four years – brief but unbelievably transformative. Maybe this time we will even see competition in the ASIC manufacturing business.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Amanda Fabiano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/03/25/how-bitcoin-mining-has-changed-since-the-last-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/560c8907ac26ec8258aeb6d32c3d09b857e31446-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A surge in social media activity surrounding the coin coincided with a price increase of over 14% within the last week. However, technical indicators hint at a potential pullback, leaving investors to grapple with mixed signals. Related Reading: Analyst Bullish On Polkadot (DOT), Predicts $17 Price Target Before April Social Media Frenzy Fuels Optimism Data from LunarCrush, a crypto analytics platform, revealed a significant uptick in social media interactions related to DOGE. Likes, comments, retweets, and upvotes on various platforms reached a staggering 30 million within a 24-hour period. This surge in social volume not only placed DOGE at the forefront of meme coin discussions but also suggests renewed investor interest. Regulatory Integration Paves The Way For Institutional Adoption Adding fuel to the fire, Coinbase Derivatives recently filed with the CFTC to introduce US-regulated futures contracts for DOGE, alongside Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. This regulatory move signifies a growing acceptance of established cryptocurrencies beyond the realm of traditional financial institutions. Integration with established players could lead to greater market stability and wider adoption for DOGE. April: Historically A Bullish Month For Dogecoin? The report also highlights a historical trend – April has proven to be a particularly strong month for DOGE in previous years. This historical data injects a dose of optimism into the current scenario, hinting at a potential price upswing in the coming weeks. However, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, and investors should be cautious about relying solely on historical trends. Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.472 trillion. Chart: TradingView Technical Indicators Flash Caution Despite the positive social media sentiment and historical precedent, technical indicators paint a somewhat contrasting picture. The Aroon Up Line, an indicator that gauges trend strength, suggests a weakening uptrend for DOGE. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) – a measure of money flow – currently displays a negative value, indicating potential selling pressure. DOGE seven-day price action.

But although there has been a bit of a recovery in the crypto market, another reason entirely is behind this surge in price and it has everything to do with the currently incarcerated founder of the Terra blockchain, Do Kwon. Terra Founder Gets Released Do Kwon, the founder of the billion-dollar Terra blockchain, which collapsed in 2022, has been in prison in Montenegro for months now after being apprehended with fake travel documents. Since then, there have been numerous efforts by both the United States and South Korean governments to get the founder extradited for prosecution in their respective countries to no avail. Related Reading: Bernstein Analysts Says Bitcoin Will Reach A New ATH By Year End, Here’s The Target Between the two countries vying for extradition, there have been reports that the Montenegrin court is leaning toward extraditing him to South Korea to face charges for the collapse of the blockchain. Despite this, the founder remains in Montenegro as a final decision on his extradition has yet to be made. While the courts deliberate on where to send the founder, Do Kwon has finally secured a release from prison in Montenegro. According to the release reports, Do Kwon is expected to remain in the country until the courts decide his fate. Prison Chief Darko Vukcevic confirmed Do Kwon’s release from prison as he says that the disgraced founder has served the entirety of his sentence for the fake travel documents. He was reportedly released on Saturday, March 23, and is currently under house arrest. LUNC And USTC React To Do Kwon’s Release The prices of USTC and LUNC have reacted positively to the news of Do Kwon getting released on Saturday. After the news made the round, the prices of both altcoins saw a significant uptick, turning green despite the crypto market continuing to struggle. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Bleed For One Week Straight – Can Price Recover To $73,000? The LUNC price saw an over 10% jump from its Sunday lows of $0.00015, reaching as high as $0.000172 before correcting back downward. In the same vein, the USTC price also recorded a 10% increase during this time, going from $0.028 to peak at $0.031. So far, both altcoins have been able to maintain their gains in the last day, which could signal a continuation in the uptrend. Right now, there is not much resistance for both assets and if Bitcoin continues to rise, then both USTC and LUNC are expected to follow. At the time of writing, LUNC is trading at $0.0001672 with a 24-hour gain of 9.4%, and USTC is trading at $0.0303 with a 24-hour gain of 5.39%, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The crypto market began the week in the green as traders cheered BlackRock's foray into asset tokenization and the beginning of the global central bank easing cycle. Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest digital asset, traded at $67,000, up 3% on a 24-hour basis, and ether traded 2.3% higher above $3,400. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the most liquid cryptocurrencies, was up around 3.2% at press time. Bradley Park, an analyst at CryptoQuant, attributes the gains to the market digesting BlackRock's fund targeting tokenized products (BUIDL) on Ethereum. Other tokens gaining on Monday were Internet Computer (ICP), which added 20%, Ondo Finance’s ONDO, rising 15%, and Near protocol (NEAR), also about 15% higher over 24 hours.

The charges, which also name two Binance executives detained by the government, were announced by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, one outlet reported. The exchange is being charged with four counts of tax evasion, including ""non-payment of Value-Added Tax (VAT), Company Income Tax, failure to tax returns, and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through its platform.""  The cryptocurrency market remains fixated on spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows rather than fundamentals, as the recently approved products saw their first week of net outflows in two months, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report on Friday. Coinbase noted that net outflows amounted to $836 million between March 18 and March 21. Bitcoin slipped below $63,000 last week as the outflows sped up. It was recently trading at around $66,800. There is little insight into what drove the surge in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which reached $1.83 billion in total over four days, the report said.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the number of new Solana-based tokens created per day.  The daily count surged to nearly 10,000 early this month.  The increased network activity, fueled by memecoins and politically-themed tokens, has users rushing to purchase the token to access the Solana ecosystem, 21Shares said.  That's creating a reflexive demand for Solana's SOL token analogous to the impact on ETH during 2017's ICO craze, 21Shares added.

42408614,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaqRD5,1711371360,How Many Years Will SBF Get? Jury's Out on Betting Platform Polymarket,"Prediction markets can be silly, but they can be serious, too, as a tool for investors to hedge their exposure to a certain stock or engage in price discovery on the future growth of one given the market success of its products.  In this week's roundup, we're setting aside politics for popcorn and electric dreams, diving deep into Tesla deliveries and box office openings. But first…  Sentencing Sam Bankman-Fried  FTX's founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is scheduled to be sentenced this week (a position he was put in after an award-winning CoinDesk scoop revealed how precarious his empire's finances were), and the proverbial jury on Polymarket is out on how long the sentence will be.  A death sentence for Bankman-Fried isn't on the table as one juror (the real kind, not the Polymarket hive mind) initially feared in the early days of the trial. But it's almost evenly up in the air as to if he'd get between 20-50 years with the U.S. Department of Justice proposing five decades behind bars.  Bad news for those who would like to see Bankman-Fried leave jail old and gray: he might be out in less than a decade. In prior interviews with CoinDesk, lawyers familiar with white-collar cases prosecuted in the Southern District of New York say there's a possibility his sentence might be significantly reduced as creditors have been made whole although his lack of remorse could undo this.  Kalshi's Electric Clash  On Kalshi – the more buttoned-up, CFTC-registered prediction market platform – traders had a busy week monetarily debating how many electric vehicles Tesla would report it delivered this quarter as part of its earnings statement.  There's a lot at stake for Tesla. Its stock price directly moves on this number. Elon Musk's electric car giant confidently hit an all-time high for shipments last quarter at 485,000, but the global economy is giving mixed signals. China's economy is cooling, and homegrown BYD has matured to the point where it has become so competitive that it has usurped Tesla as the world's largest electric vehicle maker.  Currently, the market doesn't think Tesla will beat the record set last quarter (remember there is an element of seasonality to the sales cycle), and the money has closed in just below UBS' estimate of 432,000. The company is scheduled to report earnings in mid-April.  Volume for this contract is lower than what you'd find on a comparable contract on Polymarket, a crypto-based platform that can do business just about everywhere but the U.S. and Taiwan. Perhaps that's the cost of doing business as a CFTC-registered entity limited to the U.S.  Betting on Butts in Seats  Critics of Polymarket and prediction markets as a whole say it only encourages crypto-degeneracy because of the amount of money being placed on trivial things like Taylor Swift's potential pregnancy or if former President Donald Trump would smile in his mugshot.  Certainly, the tone of Polymarket's marketing efforts encourages the behavior. At the same time, it's important to highlight the many contracts on the platform that might aid in proper – adult – uses of prediction markets. Like price discovery, hedging, or derivatives.  One popular category of contracts on the site is betting on the box office performance of recently released movies.  The performance of these movies has a material impact on their studio's stock price, as well as the stock of large theater chains like AMC, and you'll find some guidance on how these companies expect films to do in their respective quarterly earnings.  A moderately clever bettor could read the tea leaves alongside the pop culture temperature and model out a number predicting performance.  An example of this could be found in a recent contract asking bettors to take a guess on the box office performance of the new ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire."" Initial reviews of the movie were pretty bad; the Rotten Tomatoes score is at 43%, with early reviews calling it witless and joyless. Early money had predicted it would be a modest performer at the box office and long-range forecasts from Box Office Pro put it at $35 million to $49 million.  But these bettors underestimated the power of fandom.  Despite a less-than-stellar script, the movie took in over $45 million during its U.S. opening weekend, in line with the opening weekend of the previous installment of the series, showing that fans were hungry for more Ghostbusting content. Some say it is a revenge spend of fans showing studios they want this version of Ghostbusters, and not the woke 2016 reboot. Culture war win or not, the reality is publicly listed Marcus Theaters said it would be a hit in its recent annual report, as did its competitor Cinemark. The weekend itself was fairly light in competition from other films, and there isn't a holiday or other significant culture event scheduled against it.  Is it really degenerate gambling when you can model out a forecast with Excel using SEC guidance?

42408608,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaqQzr,1711369975,Is It Late 2020 All Over Again for Dogecoin?,"There are striking similarities between DOGE's price action today and in late 2020.  The so-called fractal is noteworthy as dogecoin surged over 1,000% in early 2021.  One key principle of the Dow Theory is that asset price trends are self-repeating, functioning along Mark Twain's famous quote: ""History never repeats itself, but often rhymes."" Hence, traders often check if the ongoing price action resembles anything from the past to understand what lies ahead.  Dogecoin, the world's largest meme cryptocurrency, has recently risen above the widely tracked 50, 100, and 200-week simple moving averages of its price, ending a prolonged 20-month consolidation at bear market depths. The 50-week SMA has moved above the 100-week SMA, signaling a bullish shift in momentum.  Both developments are strikingly similar to those in late 2020. The so-called fractal is noteworthy because DOGE witnessed an explosive rally in the first five months of 2021.  Doge spent 20 months in the depths of the bear market, between 5 and 15 cents, before breaking higher from the range late last month.  A similar 20-month bear market consolidation through the second half of 2019 and 2020 set the stage for a big rally in early 2021. Back then, the cryptocurrency chalked out 3,600% surge to 37 cents by May 2021.  So, if the 2019-20 fractal is a guide, DOGE's path of least resistance could be on the higher side. A closer look at the chart shows that DOGE's uptrends are sharp but rarely last more than six months. Meanwhile, the subsequent crash and the bottoming/consolidation process take nearly three years.  Another similarity between now and 2020 is that major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, are widely expected to cut interest rates in the coming months. The expectations for renewed liquidity easing bodes well for assets far out on the risk curve. In 2020, central banks worldwide had rates pinned near zero.  Still, past data is no guarantee of future results, especially with non-serious cryptocurrencies like DOGE and other memecoins. A potential bearish turnaround in bitcoin, the crypto market leader, could single-handedly drag DOGE lower.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | DOGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/25/is-it-late-2020-all-over-again-for-dogecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac62b6355bc79fe10527046707255f903b2969b8-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It also released its third set of measures for public comment.  ESMA and the European Banking Authority have been busy finalizing measures under MiCA, which is set to take effect later this year.  The European Union's financial markets supervisor on Monday published the first of several final reports on rules under the bloc's landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, accompanied by its third consultation package.  The European Securities and Markets Authority's (ESMA) report, which follows a consultation last year, includes proposals on information the regulator will require from firms for authorization under MiCA. The report also includes requirements for firms to establish intent to provide crypto services and intent to acquire crypto assets, along with how service providers should address complaints.  The ESMA submitted the report to the 27-member bloc's executive arm, the European Commission, to be adopted and says it ""will provide further advice and technical guidance in this area if requested.""  ESMA's third consultation package seeks public comment on proposed rules covering the detection and reporting of suspected market abuse in crypto assets, guidelines on policies and procedures for crypto-asset transfer services and other measures until June 25.  The European Banking Authority (EBA) has been consulting alongside ESMA on measures under MiCA since the package's finalization in 2023. Earlier this month, the two regulators published a set of draft rules for stablecoin issuers. MiCA rules for stablecoins are set to take effect in July, and the entire package will be implemented by all member states in December.

Will it soar to new heights, fueled by institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance, or will it face a reality check and revisit recent lows? Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) Bull Run: Can FTM Hit $2 After 20% Price Spike? Bullish Vs. Bearish Perspectives On Bitcoin The optimists, led by the prominent crypto analyst Cryptoyoddha, paint a picture of a bullish future. They point to a meticulously tracked historical chart showcasing the cyclical price movements of Bitcoin. Each cycle, Cryptoyoddha argues, follows a similar pattern: a period of accumulation followed by a parabolic surge. This analysis paves the way for the highly anticipated “Cycle IV,” which could propel Bitcoin beyond its current all-time high of $73,750 and potentially reach a staggering $150,000 or even higher. #Bitcoin The real pump will start after the halving next month. pic.twitter.com/eV5FWkzkxX — Yoddha (@CryptoYoddha) March 23, 2024 But what’s driving this bullish sentiment? Cryptoyoddha cites several factors: a surge in institutional investment, a shift towards clearer regulations for cryptocurrencies, and a growing public embrace of digital assets. These trends, coupled with the historical pattern of each cycle surpassing the previous one, paint a compelling picture for Bitcoin bulls. However, not everyone is buying into the euphoria. Michaël van de Poppe, a renowned cryptocurrency trader, injects a dose of caution with his technical analysis. Studying charts that map Bitcoin’s price movements, van de Poppe detects a potentially bearish pattern following the recent price dip. I wouldn’t be surprised if #Bitcoin eventually takes the liquidity below the lows. Consolidation, low volatility. pic.twitter.com/CincO9DFjD — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) March 23, 2024 He interprets the ongoing period of consolidation – where the price fluctuates within a narrow range – as a potential precursor to a further price drop. This drop, he suggests, could see Bitcoin revisit and even break below its recent lows. Van de Poppe’s analysis focuses on the presence of “support” and “resistance” levels on his charts. These levels represent price points where historical buying and selling activity has been concentrated. If Bitcoin falls below a key support level, it could trigger a wave of panic selling, pushing the price further down. Bitcoin is now trading at $67.051. Chart: TradingView Volatility And Uncertainty The contrasting viewpoints highlight the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s price is constantly influenced by a complex web of factors, including unforeseen regulatory decisions, security breaches, and broader economic trends. While historical cycles can offer valuable insights, they are not crystal balls that guarantee future performance. Investors also need to be wary of placing blind faith in technical analysis. The market is not a purely mechanical system, and unpredictable events can disrupt even the most meticulously drawn charts. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Takes Over The Internet: Google Searches Climb As Global Interest Surges Despite the differing predictions, both analysts acknowledge the likelihood of significant price movement in the coming months. Cryptoyoddha’s bullish outlook hinges on a fundamental shift in the cryptocurrency landscape, while van de Poppe’s technical analysis suggests a potential short-term price correction. Ultimately, the fate of Bitcoin’s price in 2024 remains a mystery. The upcoming Bitcoin halving in April – an event that cuts the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation and has historically coincided with price increases – adds another layer of intrigue.

Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust reached $1.83 billion over 4 days, Coinbase noted.  Selling pressure may have come from the bankruptcy estate of Genesis Global, the report said.  The cryptocurrency market remains fixated on spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows rather than fundamentals, as the recently approved products saw their first week of net outflows in two months, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report on Friday.  Coinbase noted that net outflows amounted to $836 million between March 18 and March 21. Bitcoin slipped below $63,000 last week as the outflows sped up. It was recently trading at around $66,800.  There is little insight into what drove the surge in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which reached $1.83 billion in total over four days, the report said.  In previous weeks, positive inflows into other spot ETFs more than offset outflows from GBTC, suggesting “some capital rotation at that time,” analysts David Duong and David Han wrote. GBTC charges higher fees than the other funds.  One source of potential selling pressure that has been expected is from the bankruptcy estate of Genesis Global, amounting to the sale of 35.9 million GBTC shares, Coinbase said.  This is separate from the 30.9 million shares Genesis pledged in collateral to borrow $1.2 billion from Gemini Earn users in the third quarter of 2022, the report noted. Gemini has settled with Genesis to return those assets in kind and payment is expected in a few weeks, following court approval.  Coinbase said it's not clear whether the recent GBTC outflows are linked to these sales, and that “we can only infer that the size and scope of the change in GBTC shares outstanding coincide with recent developments on Genesis’ payment obligations.”  “More importantly, given that the majority of creditor payments will be made in crypto and not cash, the market effect on bitcoin performance should eventually be net neutral,” the report added.

The company's share price has declined since going public but has shown recent improvement, with a 1-year return of over 211%. TeraWulf's access to low-cost energy and plans for expansion into HPC and AI zero-carbon infrastructure position it for future profitability and revenue diversification. TeraWulf ( WULF ) is a company developing and operating zero-carbon bitcoin mining facilities. Two of its facilities are based in the US and are powered by hydro and nuclear energies. Upon the merger with IKONICS , WULF became publicly traded in 2021 and raised $200 million of capital. However, the share price has declined significantly since reaching an all-time high of $42 towards the end of December 2021, at the time of anticipation of WULF going public. Nonetheless, WULF kept surviving after hitting $0.79 In March 2023, with the stock trending upwards and trading at $2.5 today, delivering a 1-year return of over 211%. The stock could have also delivered higher returns had WULF not been moving sideways YTD. WULF's YTD return stands at merely 6%. I initiate my coverage with a buy rating. My 1-year price target of $2.8 presents a 15% upside from the current price of $2.46. Financial Reviews YCharts Fundamentals had been shaky, though has improved as of late. Upon raising over $200 million in the go-public transaction, WULF spent over $177 million to build out its facilities in 2021. In the next two years, WULF continued to invest a smaller amount for its facilities build-out each year, while also raising more money from a mix of debt and equity issuances. Within the same period, revenue has seen a significant increase from just $15 million in 2022 to over $69 million in FY 2023. Despite still being unprofitable, the GAAP net loss margin has also considerably narrowed by over one-sixth. YCharts Though GAAP net profitability is lacking, cash from operations / OCF has continued to improve and even reached a breakeven in FY 2023. In FY 2023, WULF generated $4.3 million of OCF. I believe the demonstration of its ability to reach positive OCF is a positive development since WULF should ideally rely less on external financing. Having gone through debt and equity issuances over the past two years, equity dilution has been pronounced, though debt management has been decent. Debt-to-equity / DE ratio has been trending down due to a series of repayments and as of FY 2023, stood at 0.6x, a decent figure. Considering the cash and short-term investments of over $54 million, track record of repayments and capital raising, and also improving fundamentals, I would say that WULF may have a safe liquidity position and outlook. Catalyst In FY 2024, I believe WULF's production cost leadership in bitcoin mining and its planned expansion into HPC / High-Performance Computing and AI infrastructure should help drive profitability as well as future diversified revenue generation. Considering that energy cost makes up almost 90% to 95% of the total cost of producing bitcoin , it remains the biggest cost driver for any bitcoin mining project. Nonetheless, this has not been the case for WULF. With the relatively blended low-cost electricity of $0.035 / kWh across both of its facilities, WULF's energy cost has only accounted for around 54% of the total cost of production today. company presentation Though the figure will potentially rise to around 56% after a halving period in FY 2024, the increase is relatively moderate and should not put pressure on WULF's profit margins, in my opinion. TheMinerMag A report by TheMinerMag further suggests that the recent increase in electricity cost due to increased competition and rates has impacted WULF's competitors, such as Iris Energy. Iris Energy has seen a consistent upward trend in electricity cost per bitcoin mined over the past two years. As of the start of the year, its electricity cost was $18.7k per bitcoin. TheMinerMag WULF, however, has shown a rather steady trend of cost movement. Aside from the sharp electricity hike in January 2024, which was a special case that impacted all of the bitcoin miners, WULF's electricity cost per bitcoin mined has been mostly in and around $10k, which is exceptional. At $16.7k in January, WULF's electricity cost per bitcoin was also still over 11% lower than Iris Energy's. company presentation In my view, the key success factor for WULF lies in its infrastructure. By selecting sites with significant energy surpluses, WULF has been able to negotiate a long-term energy generation contract at a relatively low cost per kWh. In FY 2024 and beyond, I believe WULF's access to steady low-cost energy generation with zero carbon footprint should serve as a competitive advantage. This is particularly important considering WULF's projected expansion into HPC and AI applications. In my opinion, WULF today indeed is in a good position to secure HPC and AI site development contracts with hyper scalers, such as Microsoft, Google, or Amazon, primarily due to the available capacity and also WULF's strong ESG positioning due to the zero carbon footprint: Investments in cloud infrastructure by prominent hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Oracle, and Google have experienced impressive average annual growth, exceeding 30% over the past five years. In 2022 alone, these entities collectively spent $158 billion. The demanding specifications of hyperscalers necessitates sites capable of accommodating several hundred megawatts to sustain multiple data center buildings ranging from 40 to 80 megawatts each. These locations must also offer direct access to extensive contiguous land suitable for constructing data centers, power banks, parking facilities, loading zones, and ancillary buildings, access to water to run in the most efficient manner, and critically must adhere to a sustainable ESG framework. TeraWulf is uniquely positioned to fulfill all these requirements. Source: Q4 earnings call. The ESG agenda will continue to present a catalyst for WULF, in my opinion. The proposed facility for HPC and AI will be in Lake Mariner, where the energy generation comes from hydropower, which should comply with the ESG requirements of WULF's potential clients, most especially the hyperscalers. As per a report , many IT leaders from various organizations will continue to face pressure to integrate ESG elements into business operations. Moreover, IT leaders' compensation may also be linked to their ESG achievements: By 2027, 25% of CIOs will see their personal compensation linked to their sustainable technology impact,"" writes Autumn Stanish, senior principal analyst at Gartner. ""Responsibilities for sustainability are increasingly being passed down from CIOs to infrastructure and operations (I&O) leaders to improve IT's environmental performance, particularly around data centers,"" Stanish adds. Source: IT Pro. Risk Despite the promising ESG positioning and cost leadership, I believe risk remains moderate. The process towards revenue diversification is still pretty early at this point, and in my opinion, WULF may potentially see an increase in operating expenses as it ramps up activities in business developments for the HPC and AI applications. Furthermore, I also think that the situation post-halving is still unpredictable. For instance, the fact that miners' rewards are also halved for each block generated may result in temporarily lower revenue for WULF, effectively pressuring profit margins. On the flip side, the reduced rewards may also be offset with the higher transaction fees, while the bitcoin halving may also provide an opportunity for WULF to boost its hash rates by acquiring and improving less efficient miners potentially shutting down due to mining incentives falling below sustainable levels. Valuation/Pricing My target price for WULF is driven by the following assumptions for the bull vs bear scenarios of the FY 2024 projection: Bull scenario (50% probability) assumptions - I conservatively expect WULF to achieve an FY 2024 revenue of $200 million, a 189% growth, slightly lower than the market's high-end estimate . I assign WULF a forward P/S of 7.5x, which implies a share price appreciation of $4. In this scenario, I would expect WULF to maintain a steady profit margin upon halving and see early success in its expansion into HPC and AI. Bear scenario (50% probability) assumptions - WULF to deliver FY 2024 revenue of $100 million, missing the low end range of the market's estimate. In this scenario, I expect WULF to see a correction to $1.5, as a result of lower revenue generation due to halving. own analysis Consolidating all the information above into my model, I arrived at an FY 2024 weighted target price of $2.8 per share, presenting a potential upside of 15% from the current level. At this point, I would give the stock a buy rating. As an important note, due to the lack of guidance provided by WULF, I have applied conservative approaches in building my price target model across bull and bear scenarios. Using market's revenue estimates as a base, I considerably lowered WULF's FY 2024 revenue estimates for both scenarios while also assuming a 50% increase in average shares outstanding. As such, my projection implies that WULF will be doing some equity issuance to further dilute investors in FY 2024, potentially for repayments and funding for the HPC and AI projects. With all of those in mind, the 15% upside here still presents attractive enough risk-reward, in my opinion. Conclusion WULF is a leading bitcoin miner with strong cost leadership due to its strategic mining infrastructure. Given the low-cost electricity and zero-carbon energy generation, WULF is also well-positioned to expand into HPC and AI applications business by building out ESG-focused infrastructure for clients like the hyperscalers. Nonetheless, the halving event which may also cut rewards in half still presents uncertainties not just for WULF but for the rest of the players. My highly conservative price target of $2.8 implies a 15% upside, which should be attractive. In my opinion, at $2.46, WULF appears undervalued.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4680221-terawulf-strong-cost-advantage-with-potential-undervaluation?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/24779963.jpeg

24778550,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599478,1711358113,"What is Macro/Crypto Summer? Don’t Miss Out, Says Expert","In a thread on X (formerly Twitter), Raoul Pal, a renowned trading guru and the founder/CEO of Global Macro Investor and Real Vision, has illuminated the crypto community about the advent of what he terms as the “Macro/Crypto Summer.” This period, according to Pal, is not just a fleeting season but a significant phase in the financial and cryptocurrency markets, deeply rooted in the cyclical nature of the global economy. Why The Macro/Crypto Summer Matters Pal elaborates on the concept of the “Macro Summer,” explaining it as a pivotal phase in “The Everything Code” cycle, closely following the Financial Conditions Index, which historically precedes the cycle by approximately ten months. The ISM (Institute for Supply Management) index, a key indicator of economic health, often bottoms out during this period, marking the start of GDP growth. Related Reading: Buy High, Sell Low: FOMO Made This Crypto Trader Lose 6,039 SOL Pal’s thesis draws attention to the “near-perfect 3 1/2 year cyclicality” in the ISM business cycle, propelled by liquidity dynamics and the debt refinancing cycle at its core. He underscores the significance of liquidity: “And that is driven by liquidity, which bottomed at the end of 2022… macro summer and fall are all about liquidity rising and is a core part of The Everything Code thesis.” This influx of liquidity is crucial for tech stocks, which historically thrive during these phases. Yet, it’s Bitcoin and, more broadly, the cryptocurrency market that exhibit the most dramatic responses. Pal presents staggering growth figures from past Macro Summer and Fall seasons to underscore his point: Bitcoin: Saw increases of “2012/2013: +146x, 2016/2017: +30x, 2020/2021: +8x…” Ethereum: As an altcoin during the 2016/2017 and 2020/2021 cycles, it achieved “2016/2017: +1,770x, 2020/2021: +41x.” Altcoins (excluding ETH): Witnessed an aggregate market cap rise of “+24x” in the last cycle. “Wild! When we just look at Altcoins ex-ETH (we only have shorter data for the last cycle), the entire market cap rose +24x! And that includes thousands of worthless tokens that didn’t rise, so I’m not just cherry-picking winners here,” Pal remarked. DOGE, a popular meme coin, is mentioned by the expert as another prime example of the “power of Crypto Summer and Fall,” with its value experiencing significant multipliers – “2016/2017: +136x, 2020/2021: +370x” – in the aforementioned cycles. These figures underline the significant influence of macroeconomic cycles on crypto valuations, with Pal pointing out the alignment of these cycles with Bitcoin’s halving events. “Crypto summer has started and fully develops post-halving,” he states, highlighting the interconnectedness of these cycles with the broader financial landscape. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals The Possibility Of Bitcoin Reaching $500,000 Notably, Pal’s analysis doesn’t stop at the past; it looks forward, suggesting that liquidity is expected to rise all the way into the end of 2025. This anticipation is rooted in a complex interplay of global financial mechanisms, including the potential for increased US money printing in response to a massive ramp-up in interest payments and changes in Fed Net Liquidity and the Treasury General Account (TGA). “Will the US join the summer party? I know it seems impossible now, but the US is on the verge of a massive ramp-up in interest payments. […] at some point – the balance sheet will stop shrinking, which is enough to unleash liquidity into the system. […] I cannot see how they don’t massively expand liquidity, one way or another. Meanwhile, Pal predicts that it won’t be just the US injecting liquidity into the financial systems in the coming months. “I’ve no idea whether it’s China, the EU, Japan or the US that drives this or maybe a bit of all. Time will tell,” he remarked. Pal attributes his investment strategies, especially in tech and crypto, to the insights gained from The Everything Code. This approach has prepared him for the unfolding Macro Summer, with a keen eye on the altcoin market and the so-called “Banana Zone.” He concludes: But the bigger game is yet to be played out as Alt season arrives and we fully enter the Banana Zone. The Banana Zone cometh, and it is a huge wealth-generating machine. Patience will be rewarded. In the meantime, don’t fuck this up. #DFTU At press time, BTC traded at $67,003.

The charges come after a tense few weeks during which two senior executives of the crypto exchange were detained by authorities.  Local media reported that one of the two executives escaped and may have left the country.  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, was charged with tax evasion by Nigerian authorities as a weekslong standoff between the two parties intensified, local media outlets reported Monday, citing a statement from the country's tax watchdog.  The charges, which also name two Binance executives detained by the government, were announced by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, one outlet reported. The exchange is being charged with four counts of tax evasion, including ""non-payment of Value-Added Tax (VAT), Company Income Tax, failure to tax returns, and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through its platform.""  News of the charges follows weeks of scrutiny and criticism of the crypto exchange by the Nigerian government, which went so far as to invite and then detain two Binance executives. The government says the platform processed billions of dollars worth of suspected criminal funds and set an exchange rate for the local currency, the naira.  Meanwhile, one of the two executives held by the government, Nadeem Anjarwalla, has escaped, presidential spokesman Bayo Onanuga told Bloomberg. The news service was also told by Binance that the company was made aware Anjarwalla is no longer in Nigerian custody by authorities. The country is working with Interpol to secure an international arrest warrant for Anjarwalla, who is the company's regional manager for Africa, Reuters reported, citing the president's adviser on national security.

Google Trends data reveals a global increase in searches for “Shiba Inu” and related queries, indicating renewed investor optimism for the meme coin. Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) Bull Run: Can FTM Hit $2 After 20% Price Spike? Shiba Inu Surge Sparks Enthusiasm This increase comes after a quiet period for the memecoin. However, the past month has been nothing short of phenomenal. Search popularity reached a seven-day peak of 100 on March 16th, though it has settled at a still-healthy 48 – significantly higher than January’s levels. Phrases like “Why is Shiba Inu going up?” and “Shiba Inu All-Time High” have also seen a significant uptick, reflecting investor curiosity and potential buying interest. While the interest is global, specific regions are leading the charge. Pakistan, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Canada, and Nigeria have emerged as the top search originators for SHIB in the past week. This geographically diverse interest suggests a broad-based appeal for the meme coin. Source: Google Trends This renewed interest coincides with a remarkable price rally. SHIB’s value has skyrocketed over 180% in the past month, reaching a two-year high of $0.000045. This bullish run fueled speculation of a retest of its all-time high above $0.000088. However, the market has since witnessed a correction, bringing SHIB’s price down slightly. Despite the correction, the enthusiasm within the Shiba Inu community remains high. The long-term goal of reaching $0.01 per SHIB token continues to be a hot topic, although analysts caution it might take several years to materialize. Bitcoin is now trading at $66.780. Chart: TradingView Shibarium And Market Recovery To achieve this ambitious target, the developers are focusing on Shibarium, the project’s Layer-2 scaling solution. Shibarium aims to become a thriving smart contract hub, potentially attracting more users and driving up demand for SHIB. Experts believe several factors are contributing to the current Shiba Inu frenzy. The broader cryptocurrency market has shown signs of recovery after a recent slump, potentially boosting investor confidence in meme coins like SHIB. Additionally, ongoing developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as Shibarium and the burning initiatives to reduce the overall token supply, might be fueling investor optimism. Related Reading: Eyes On Toncoin: Speculation Rises After 40% Weekly Surge – What Comes Next? Whether SHIB can maintain its current momentum and reach its long-term price goals remains to be seen.

That's a sign of investors holding on to their coin stash in anticipation of higher prices, analysts at Blockware Solutions said.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} price recently rose to new record highs above $70,000. Still, the real economic activity on the Bitcoin blockchain is limping along, not sprinting.  The divergence partly represents strong holding sentiment in the market, according to one research firm.  ""Average on-chain transfer volume (USD Denominated) is well below the 2021 bull market peak. Hardly any value is being moved on-chain,"" analysts at Blockware Solutions said in the latest edition of the Blockware Intelligence newsletter. ""Nobody wants to sell.""  Data tracking firm Glassnode defines transfer volume as the U.S. dollar value of the total BTC transferred on-chain. The metric considers only successful transfers.  At press time, the seven-day and 14-day average mean transfer volume stood below $200,000, a far cry from $1 million and higher during the 2021 bull market, data tracked by Glassnode show.  Wall Street's embrace of the Nasdaq-listed spot bitcoin ETFs has been the primary reason for bitcoin's latest rally. In other words, the spot volume has been concentrated in ETFs, which also explains the low on-chain volume.  Nevertheless, other metrics also indicate that investors who survived the 2022 bear market are holding onto their coin stash in anticipation of a continued price rally.  For instance, the percentage of bitcoin supply that was last active between hree and five years ago continues to increase. Several analysts expect bitcoin's price to rally into six figures in the coming months, eventually peaking well above $150,000.  ""Once we see the price really start to move, that's when on-chain volume will surge. Older coins will move to exchanges to be sold. Until then, low on-chain volume is a sign of supply-side illiquidity,"" analysts at Blockware said.  Bitcoin changed hands at $67,700 at press time, up 5% on a 24-hour basis.

Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the world's largest digital asset, traded at $67,300, up 4.9% on a 24-hour basis and ether traded 4.7% higher above $3,400. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the most liquid cryptocurrencies, was up around 5% at press time.  Bradley Park, an analyst at CryptoQuant, attributes the gains to the market digesting BlackRock's fund targeting tokenized products on Ethereum called BUIDL.  Shorts that bet against bitcoin and ether are seeing significant losses. Data source CoinGlass shows that over $100 million in leveraged futures positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours, with around $60 million in short BTC positions and $42.8 million in short ether positions.  Meanwhile, BTC may be up as selling pressure from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has slowed. Analysts point to Genesis' sale of shares as a reason for the uptick in GBTC outflow.  Macro factors continue to align bullishly. Last week, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) unexpectedly cut the benchmark interest rate, kicking off a global easing cycle. The Central Bank of Mexico also cut rates, and the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England laid the groundwork for the so-called liquidity easing in the coming months.
