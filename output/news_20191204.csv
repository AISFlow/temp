42431203,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN13th,1575497130,What Twitter Meme Wars Say About Crypto's Reliance on Figureheads,"Would you get a tattoo of your employer‚Äôs logo?      Gareth Li, head of business development and partnerships at Binance X, had the crypto exchange's angular diamond etched on his arm to match founder Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao's ink. And a similar level of commitment extends to the charismatic CZ‚Äôs fans, who get their own Binance tattoos, sometimes permanently.      Cryptocurrency has strayed from its roots in the decade since a mysterious programmer (whose identity remains unknown, and to most users unimportant) invented a new form of anonymous digital cash. Today, cults of personality and public histrionics define the sector. And the stakes are often higher than getting inked like an idol.      Industry dynamics are ‚Äúgetting very personal,‚Äù¬†as one Chinese investor, who did not want to be identified, put it.      CMT Digital‚Äôs head of trading, Brad Koeppen, agreed. Cryptocurrency markets are almost uniquely vulnerable to gossip and sentiment swings, he said. The correlation between public personas and trading activity isn't always apparent from public exchange data, especially for tokens with identifiable figureheads like Binance‚Äôs BNB (CZ) and Tron‚Äôs TRX (founder Justin Sun), Koeppen said.      ""It's a little bit more relationship-driven at this point"" than traditional markets, he said. ‚ÄúThat has to do with the number of entities that are involved.‚Äù      Meme wars spawned last month over media coverage of Binance‚Äôs operations in China offered a salient example of celebrity token politics.      When news outlet The Block published an article on Nov. 21 with an unnamed witness claiming Chinese police conducted a ‚Äúraid‚Äù on Binance‚Äôs Shanghai office, the Twitter feud escalated to near-nuclear proportions. The price of BNB also continued a downward slide from roughly $17 to below $15 the next day.      Social media chatter routinely sways crypto price movements. For example, in July the news of TRX creator Justin Sun‚Äôs thwarted Warren Buffett lunch also influenced market activity, Koeppen said. He described this as a widespread issue faced by cryptocurrencies with prominent founders.      ""It's hard to know when Joe Lubin or Vitalik Buterin will say something, or when Justin Sun will get in trouble. The market reacts quickly,"" he said.      These cults of personality harness fans and followers to influence the market by defining the public narrative. And the entrepreneurs themselves encourage grassroots marketing by using retail investors as foot soldiers. In seemingly rare circumstances, some founders even offer monetary rewards.    Meet Tommy Mustache    The day The Block published its ‚Äúraid‚Äù report, Binance‚Äôs Zhao tweeted that he would devote 100 bitcoin to an anti-FUD fund. FUD, or ‚Äúfear, uncertainty and doubt,‚Äù is the rallying cry of crypto fans aggrieved by anything that doesn‚Äôt sing the praises of their favored token. Sun, who is now also a Poloniex investor, tweeted that he would personally donate 100 bitcoin to Zhao‚Äôs ‚ÄúFUD fighting fund.‚Äù      Beyond the anti-FUD fund, Sun also announced that he was sending $1,000 worth of USDT to a self-taught trader now living in Silicon Valley, known on Twitter as ‚ÄúTommy Mustache,‚Äù to help him make derogatory memes shaming The Block‚Äôs staff for failing to apologize for a sensationalist article. (Mustache confirmed to CoinDesk that he received Sun‚Äôs payment.)      As a passionate holder of both BNB and TRX, Mustache said several people in his Telegram groups sold their BNB after The Block report because they feared Zhao may be arrested or otherwise penalized.      ‚ÄúInvestors like me are getting hurt [by rumors] and we are sick of it,‚Äù Mustache said.      To be clear, so far little evidence suggests there was a police ‚Äúraid,‚Äù and that phrasing was later changed by The Block to ‚Äúvisit.‚Äù There does, however, appear to be ongoing changes related to how and where China-based Binance staffers operate. Even if Chinese authorities are taking a close look at various offices affiliated with the exchange, that doesn‚Äôt imply any such visit would be disciplinary.      Still, Zhao later denied the existence of any Binance office in Shanghai since 2017, which strained credulity given the fact that employees were working in that area. When asked if he believes Zhao and Sun‚Äôs personal reputations give the tokens he owns their value, Mustache said that was ‚Äúabove his pay grade‚Äù and declined to comment on whether he would sell if anything happened to Zhao personally.      Regardless, Zhao‚Äôs rivals and former coworkers at the Asian OKEx exchange promoted this headline feud while spreading other accusations of dishonesty and unethical behavior by Zhao personally. (In Chinese social media groups, sexist criticism of Binance co-founder and fellow OKEx alum He Yi took a dark turn that has, fortunately, not made its way to Crypto Twitter.)      In short, Mustache worried negative headlines and Twitter feuds were impacting the value of his holdings.      That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs using the money from Sun to pay a graphic designer in Romania who makes reporter-bashing memes, in addition to thousands of dollars from Mustache‚Äôs own money. The funds are distributed to followers who share memes or contribute their own, following the giveaway format Sun often uses for the TRX community.      Mustache, who said he never received money from either founder before this incident, met Zhao in person over Thanksgiving weekend. Zhao likened their burgeoning bromance to a first date as the BNB holders‚Äô meme-making crusade raged on. On Dec. 2, Mustache retweeted a call to ‚Äúprotect our investments‚Äù by discrediting FUD. (Binance denied contributing any money to this meme war.)    FUD according to whom?    As this case illustrates, what qualifies as FUD is generally defined by crypto celebrities.      In many cases, bombastic tweets and public announcements from token founders appear to surf the gray area between misrepresentation and optimism.      ‚ÄúThis space is so young and immature, compared to what the business norms are,‚Äù said attorney Nelson Rosario, who specializes in legal issues related to cryptocurrency at the Chicago-based firm Smolinski Rosario Law. ‚ÄúPeople are still trying to figure out the killer use cases. So best practices are being developed on the fly.‚Äù      Compare the latest Binance examples to when Sun tweeted in October that an upcoming partnership would expose TRX to ‚Äúbillions of customers.‚Äù The reality was made clear later that week: A small technical update meant Samsung devices could be used more easily by Tron developers (and, ostensibly, dapp users).      Yet the price of TRX increased in the days leading up to Samsung‚Äôs flagship conference, from roughly $0.01 on Oct. 25 to $0.02 on Oct. 29, when it was clear Sun would speak at the event but there wasn't any clarity what he would be announcing. The price slid back down after the less-than-overwhelming conference announcement on Oct. 31.      ‚ÄúWe have a real definition problem in terms of the language we all use. We think we are saying the same things, but we‚Äôre definitely not,‚Äù Rosario said, speaking to the ambiguity of what it means to ‚Äúdistribute‚Äù apps and tokens.      In neither case, Zhao‚Äôs denial nor Sun‚Äôs hyped-up speech, did token fans demand apologies or retractions for unclear or misleading statements that might protect or bolster the respective token‚Äôs reputation. Those demands are reserved for statements that could be seen as negative. (CoinDesk reached out to both the Tron and Binance teams. We will update the article if we hear back.)    Heliocentrism    Stepping back, Sun may have gotten involved with the latest anti-FUD meme war because it could impact his businesses as well.      One Chinese bitcoiner and crypto investor, who asked to stay anonymous to protect business relationships with the parties involved, said Zhao and Sun work closely together and such relationships ‚Äúimpact how liquidity will flow.‚Äù      Plus, Sun tweeted in October that he owns a ‚Äúhuge bag‚Äù of BNB tokens, along with the native tokens of other Chinese exchanges that ‚Äúsupport‚Äù the TRX project. In some ways, the price of TRX may be influenced by Binance‚Äôs liquidity, which over-the-counter traders often described as unusually authentic and reliable.      Instead, Rosario agreed with Koeppen that the crypto market‚Äôs relative immaturity can make it difficult to distinguish puffery and personal politics from any deliberate intent to manipulate retail investors.      ‚ÄúThere is a certain element of fake it until you make it for any emerging technology field,‚Äù Rosario said. ‚ÄúWith Theranos, they had a product that they claimed worked. But it didn‚Äôt work. ‚Ä¶ Do any of these [blockchain] networks actually work? What does that mean?‚Äù",NEUTRAL,TRX | BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | TRX | BNB,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/04/what-twitter-meme-wars-say-about-cryptos-reliance-on-figureheads,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c2da3b4529d95d6f9bae8d1b97d17c14ff9afb7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431205,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN13vh,1575477934,Litecoin's Mining Power Tanks to Lowest in Year Following Price Plunge,"Litecoin‚Äôs price plunge in recent months has whittled away the profitability of mining the cryptocurrency, leading to a shakeout among computer operators on the network seen as a faster and cheaper but less secure version of bitcoin.       Prices for litecoin, created in 2011 just two years after bitcoin, have fallen to about $45, from a peak around $140 in June. And under the network‚Äôs original programming design, rewards for mining new blocks of data were slashed by 50 percent on Aug. 5, an every-four-years event known as a halving.      The combination of factors has cut the profits of mining litecoin using the popular Innosilicon A6+ computers to $1.68 per 24 hours, from $2.65 in mid-June, assuming a standard electricity cost, according to f2pool.¬†That‚Äôs a slim margin for a machine that costs $3,000 new, according to the manufacturer‚Äôs website.      Operators using the older-model and less-powerful Antminer L3 computers are currently getting a negligible profit of just 6 or 7 cents a day, f2pool's mining profitability calculator shows.       So, many smaller litecoin miners are now simply choosing to drop off the network, evidenced by a decline of more than 70 percent since July in the network‚Äôs hash rate, which measures the combined computing processing power of all operators. On Nov. 30, litecoin‚Äôs hash rate touched 149.6 terahashes per second, the lowest in a year.       ‚ÄúIf miners are underwater, or running non-economical gear, most likely they will decommission that equipment,‚Äù said Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of the cryptocurrency analysis firm Digital Asset Research in New York. ‚ÄúHash rate follows price, not the other way around.‚Äù       The new dynamic in the litecoin market offers a lesson in the emerging economics of the fast-growing cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, which relies on networks of computers to confirm and record transactions, using a combination of incentives. Key inputs include the speed and efficiency of the data-mining computers, local electricity costs and even the ambient temperature; cold climes are considered ideal because less power is needed to run cooling fans for the computers, which typically run 24 hours a day, seven days a week - that is, when it‚Äôs profitable to do so.       Many operators on the litecoin network have been using the L3 machines, and the recent market move has ‚Äútested the shutdown price,‚Äù Steve Tsou, CEO of RRMine, a bitcoin-focused asset-management and trading platform, said in a LinkedIn message.      It‚Äôs likely that some miners in China dropped out of the market recently as the rainy season tapered off in regions where they‚Äôre relying on supplies of cheap hydropower, he said.      Under the litecoin protocol, mining new units of the cryptocurrency automatically adjusts to become easier when the hash rate falls, a mechanism designed to lure operators back in following a sharp price drop or a cut in the rewards.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution first reported that Kemp was considering Loeffler on Friday, with the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, AP and other outlets confirming its reporting earlier this week. Loeffler will take office on Jan. 1, 2020. Though Isakson's term ends in January 2023, Loeffler will have to run for election next year if she intends to serve past January 2021.      Kemp appointed Loeffler, a Republican, against the reported wishes of President Donald Trump, who apparently expressed a preference for Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.). However, Loeffler has the backing of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), according to Politico.      While Loeffler said she was ""pro-Trump,"" and in favor of his border wall, the Second Amendment and against abortion and socialism, she did not address crypto or bitcoin in her introductory remarks.      According to NPR, Kemp opened an online application process for the position after Isakson announced he would retire on Dec. 31, 2019 for health reasons. Loeffler applied for the position on the last day of the deadline.      (""While unorthodox, we opened the process to everyone,"" Kemp said of the application.)      Loeffler has been the chief executive of Bakkt, the Intercontinental Exchange‚Äôs bitcoin-focused subsidiary, since the entity‚Äôs announcement in August 2018. Under her tenure, the company rolled out its physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts earlier this year.      Bakkt has more recently announced its intention to develop a consumer-facing mobile application for bitcoin payments, expanded custody services, as well as options and cash-settled futures contracts to be rolled out in the coming weeks.      It remains unclear who will take the helm at Bakkt after Loeffler takes up her new position on Jan. 1, 2020. However, current COO and former Coinbase executive Adam White would be a natural successor to the role. A spokesperson did not return a request for comment by press time.      A press release shared after this article was published congratulated Loeffler on her new role.

42431196,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN13jh,1575460444,North Korean Hacking Group May Be Behind Malware-Laden Fake Crypto Site,"A new and hard-to-detect macOS malware variant has been discovered lurking on a fake cryptocurrency trading site.      Discovered by malware researcher Dinesh Devadoss, the malicious code is believed to have been developed by the notorious North Korean hacking group Lazarus, Bleeping Computer reports on Wednesday.      The software was found on a website with the address ""unioncrypto.vip"" and claiming to offer a ""smart cryptocurrency arbitrage trading platform,"" according to the report, however no download links are live on the site.      Of concern to researchers, the variant is able to pull a payload from a remote location and run it in memory, making it harder to conduct forensic analysis. So far, the malware can be detected by very few virus detection engines, with only five raising an alert when the Bleeping Computer report was published.      The malicious package has no certificate, however, and raises an alert from macOS. Further, while the remote server is active, there is not yet any payload present. Those factors may mean the malware was found before the hackers were able to complete the trap, presumably aimed at crypto holders.      Another researcher, Patrick Wardle, said that there are ""clear overlaps"" between this new malware threat and another recently attributed to Lazarus. A malware variant found in October, attributed to the hacking group, was also hidden on a fake crypto trading site.      Bleeping Computer also cites another instance, discovered by Kapersky and attributed to Lazarus, that used a cryptocurrency trading app to deploy Mac malware.      In September, the U.S. sanctioned three North Korean entities for cyber crimes, citing cryptocurrency thefts as one of the reasons behind the move.      The U.S. Department of the Treasury identified Lazarus, as well as Bluenoroff and Andariel, as entities it believed responsible for the theft of $571 million-worth of cryptos from Asian exchanges in 2017 and 2018.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/04/north-korean-hacking-group-may-be-behind-malware-laden-fake-crypto-site,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43bcebed4b4df55c6cef38bae8e8969d1a077019-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Japan's MUFG Bank and Recruit Holdings are reportedly launching a digital currency as part of a new payments initiative.      The Japan News (a Yomiuri Shimbun outlet) said Wednesday it has learned that the two firms will initially target smartphone payments for general users before moving on to business-to-business payments.      MUFG and Recruit ‚Äì a human resources giant that owns recruitment site Indeed and employer review site Glassdoor, among others ‚Äì inked a deal to set up a joint venture for the project in October. MUFG is expected to own 49 percent of the new entity, with Recruit holding the remainder.      MUFG is part of the Mitsubishi Group and is the largest financial group in Japan, according to online sources.      Apparently aiming to launch in H1 2020, the two partners are now seeking licensing, including as a fund transfer service, in order to become a cashless payment business, The Japan News said.      The payment project is said to be targeting the firms' millions of customers, directly and via affiliated firms, with a smartphone app linking to users' bank accounts.      Among the services on offer, money transfers between users is likely to be part of the app's offerings, according to the report. Down the road, payments may widen to include B2B and payroll transactions.      MUFG is already working on a number of blockchain initiatives, including setting up a consortium to set standards for tokenized securities. It's also working on a trade finance project using R3's Corda blockchain and has invested in SEC-regulated Securitize and blockchain sleuthing firm Chainalysis.      Soon after the report was published, MUFG issued the following statement:    ""Certain media outlets today published reports regarding establishment of a joint venture between MUFG Bank and Recruit Co., Ltd.

42383072,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9trQt,1575450000,Bitcoin No Longer Looks Like 'Digital Gold' by One Measure,"If ""digital gold"" means ""a safe-haven asset where investors park their money during financial market turmoil,"" then bitcoin doesn't fit the bill as well as it used to.      For most of the year, bitcoin's price showed a modestly negative correlation with the S&P 500. In other words, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization tended to rise on days when the bellwether stock-market index fell, and vice versa.      But since early October, that relationship has weakened, according to information provided by Digital Assets Data.      The correlation, once well into the negative 20-30 range, is now beginning to flatten towards a reading of around negative 10 percent, as shown in the chart below.      The closer to zero or a positive correlation with the stock market that bitcoin gets, the harder it is to paint the digital asset as a port in the storm.      ‚ÄúThe negative correlation has supported the store of value/digital gold thesis for BTC as investors may have been moving into the asset as a hedge against global economic turmoil,‚Äù said Kevin Kaltenbacher, Data Scientist of Digital Assets Data. ‚ÄúThese recent developments potentially present some challenges to that narrative.‚Äù      A major critic of the co-variance argument, Alex Kruger, a macro cryptocurrency analyst, took to Twitter to offer his sarcastic take, referring to both the stock and foreign exchange markets and their relationship with bitcoin.      ‚ÄúNow that the 'Stocks drive bitcoin higher' meme has been proven wrong once again, this is a good time for the 'CNH [Chinese Yuan Offshore] hedging drives bitcoin higher' meme to make it back to the stage,‚Äù¬†Kruger said.    Bitcoin still up on the year    Safe haven or not, bitcoin's price remains significantly up since the year began.      Early Wednesday UTC time, it was up 94 percent up from the price of $3,689 witnessed Jan. 1, CoinDesk‚Äôs Bitcoin Price Index shows.      At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands for $7,140 and is down 48.5 percent from its 2019 high at $13,880, witnessed June 26.      So even if bitcoin may not qualify as digital gold, long-term holders have nothing to fear from the price volatility bitcoin is currently experiencing, said Eddie Alfred, co-founder of Digitial Assets Data.      This period is an anomaly, he said.      ‚ÄúObserving 29-day periods since the genesis of bitcoin, we have seen 195 days where BTC has been down 25 percent or more from its recent high.

Sawyer compared the crypto space to real-time payments in banking -- an advanced capability that was only performed by a few banks but soon spread throughout the whole banking industry.      ‚ÄúStarling hasn‚Äôt done anything in the crypto space, and I think that is because a number of challenger banks and fintechs are just watching the market,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHowever, as our financial systems evolve, banks also need to give customers the tools to buy, sell and store crypto safely and securely. This is where businesses and consumers will turn to crypto exchanges for some [of] their banking needs.‚Äù      In addition to new kinds of banking services, Sawyer said that the next evolution in financial services will include better customer metrics.      ‚ÄúDo we [crypto firms] measure against traditional metrics like bank deposits, lending, lifetime value and cross-sell penetration? All too often banks have been stuck with a few simple metrics that don‚Äôt work,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCohort management, where you look at subsets of customers and treat their needs differently, becomes critical. At Gemini, we have customers who trade and other who invest--we use different measures across our different segments.‚Äù      In the past 18 months, Gemini has added several senior leaders to its ranks. The former global head of financial crimes at Morgan Stanley, Noah Perlman, joined Gemini as its chief compliance officer; its chief security officer, David Damato, came from cybersecurity firm Tanium; its new general counsel, Sydney Schaub, has worked for Google and Square; its managing director of operations, Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, was previously chief operating officer at the Nasdaq-owned International Securities Exchange; and former New York Stock Exchange chief information officer, Robert Cornish, came on as its chief technology officer.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/04/gemini-hires-former-starling-bank-founder-as-managing-director-of-europe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1b3f8bb84a1a8c71bb769fe984ba29e9812655b-1500x903.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
