13221717,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=478896,1639526396,Next Bitcoin ‘Buy The News’ Event Upcoming?,"&apos;Taper&apos; and &apos;volatility&apos; seem to be the words of the month as Bitcoin gets further away from its $69,000 November all-time high. Along with the short-term bearish sentiment in the crypto market, BTC had a pullback on December 13th dripping below $48,000. Some people see more downsides and others rather bid for BTCUSD gains. Investors have derisked as all eyes are on and the current FOMC meeting and the Fed tapering of asset purchases, fearing Jerome Powell will be -too- hawkish. There are many speculations running around and some experts have suggested this Wednesday could turn into a &apos;buy the rumors, sell the news&apos; event, thus Bitcoin could see buyers cashing in. As NewsBTC has reported before, the central bank is expected to start reducing its net asset purchase month by month by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. The scenario could get uglier for the traditional and crypto markets if the Fed decides on a faster taper, doubling the pace to $30 billion a month, raising interest rates earlier, meaning higher volatility.

42396338,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2mXd,1639525381,US Lawmakers Ask Janet Yellen to Define ‘Broker’ for Infrastructure Bill,"A bipartisan group of U.S. senators want Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to specify how the finance ministry will define a “broker” for crypto tax reporting purposes.  In an open letter published Tuesday, Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) wrote that the crypto industry is concerned about how a broker might be defined after the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Ac, the bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law last month.  The bill contains a handful of crypto provisions, with the one imposing reporting requirements on brokers drawing attention over the possibility that any party engaged in facilitating transactions might be classified as a broker, including software developers or wallet manufacturers. Efforts to modify the provision before the bill’s passage through the Senate were ultimately unsuccessful.  “Some market participants have expressed concern that an overly broad interpretation of this provision’s definition of ‘broker’ could capture certain individuals who are solely involved with validating distributed ledger transactions through mining, staking or other methods, and entities solely providing software or hardware solutions enabling users to maintain custody of their own digital asset wallets,” Tuesday’s letter said.  The lawmakers wrote that they believe the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Biden administration share the same definition of “broker” as the bill’s authors, which include Portman and Sinema. This would mean the provision applies to entities that actually “enable the transfer of digital assets,” and not “ancillary” parties.  The letter referenced a colloquy between Portman and Warner in which they said the provision is not meant to enact new reporting requirements on entities that are not brokers.  “We urge the Department of the Treasury to provide information or informal guidance as soon as possible – no later than the end of the current calendar year – regarding the definition of ‘broker’ as discussed during the legislative process. We are also prepared to offer legislation to further clarify that intent,” the senators wrote.  The lawmakers also asked Yellen to begin the rulemaking process – by which the Treasury Department will explain how it plans to enact the law and solicit feedback – “in an expeditious manner.”",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/14/us-lawmakers-ask-janet-yellen-to-define-broker-for-infrastructure-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df46c1d4e609de19e4dd6787f839a3f0d92cfae9-4392x2928.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396344,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2mfV,1639524600,"First Mover Asia: Crypto Traders Laying Low While Fed Ponders; Bitcoin, Ether Gain","(Edited by James Rubin)  Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin moved above $47,000 a day before a Fed decision on combating inflation.  Technician’s take: Bitcoin’s tight price range could persist into the Asia trading day.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $48,304 +2.8%  Ether (ETH): $3,843 +1.1%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,634 -0.7%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: $35,544 -0.3%  Nasdaq: $15,237 -1.14%  Gold: $1,771 -0.8%  Market moves  Bitcoin recovered some losses from Monday, trading above $48,000 on Tuesday. But the optimism may be short-lived as trading volume remained low.  Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s trading volume across major centralized exchanges on Tuesday was down from a day ago, reflecting a conservative view among traders.  The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to release its decision on Wednesday on whether it will move faster to wind down its bond purchases and signal if it will start raising interest rates next year. The stock market extended its losses on Monday as investors were closely monitoring the Fed’s upcoming decision.  “It is a bit of a daunting time right now,” Leah Wald, CEO of crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments, said in an interview with CoinDesk. Bitcoin “is still down 30% from its all-time high but we are definitely seeing strong resistance at the $48,000 and the $50,000 level.”  Ether also moved up slightly, but was still well below $4,000 at the time of publication. Dogecoin, meanwhile, remains the winning alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) of the day after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the electric-car maker would accept DOGE as payment for its merchandise.  “I think there are a lot of opportunities in the market from other alternative currencies,” Wald said, pointing out ether’s weaker correlation to the traditional markets compared with bitcoin. “Ether is down 12% in the last week alone, which is very daunting, but at the same time there are a lot of reasons to expect that ether could potentially stage a recovery much sooner than bitcoin.”  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Holds Short-Term Support at $46K; Resistance at $50K  Bitcoin (BTC) held steady around the $46,000 support level as oversold signals appeared on the charts. This means short-term buyers could remain active into the Asia trading day, although upside appears to be limited toward $50,000.  The tight trading range over the past two weeks coincided with slowing price momentum. Typically, trading volume declines when prices move sideways until a decisive breakout or breakdown is realized.  On the daily price chart, initial signs of downside exhaustion have appeared for the first time since July, which preceded a price recovery. Still, these signals are not yet confirmed, especially because multiple oversold readings have not resulted in a meaningful price bounce over the past two weeks.  For now, the intermediate-term uptrend remains weak given the downward sloping 100-period moving average on the four-hour price chart. There is also strong resistance ahead, which could keep sellers in control.

When WikiLeaks had first come out, it quickly gained popularity for publicizing news leaks and classified information on its site. Founded in 2006, the not-for-profit organization has had an interesting history, one of those being its founder, Julian Assange, being sent to prison. Even more interesting is the organization&apos;s history with leading cryptocurrency bitcoin. The anonymous whistleblower platform had gotten on the government&apos;s bad side over leaked documents that contained sensitive and classified military information. The organization which depended largely on donations had suffered greatly from this as payments processors like Visa and Mastercard had distanced themselves from the entity. WikiLeaks Turns To Bitcoin After being cut off from traditional methods of payment, WikiLeaks had turned to the next best thing. At this point, the organization needed something that could not be tracked or controlled by the government and it turned to bitcoin donations for this. Julian Assange had accused the U.S. government of endorsing what he referred to as &apos;an illegal banking blockade&apos; against WikiLeaks, forcing entities like AmEx, Visa, PayPal, etc, to stop supporting the organization.

42396341,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2maa,1639516657,Market Wrap: Cryptocurrencies Stabilize as Traders Await the Fed,"Bitcoin traded in a tight range around $46,000 on Tuesday. Some traders prefer to remain on the sideline until the U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, which could be a source of market volatility.  Despite relative calm in crypto markets, equities traded lower as the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) remained elevated around the 20 level. It appears that investors are in no rush to increase their risk exposure ahead of any Fed announcement out of the meeting.  Also, economic headwinds continue to linger. “The failure of inflation to recede as anticipated will put central banks in a more aggressive tightening stance, causing a sharply negative reaction in financial markets and most likely a significant economic recession,” Deutsche Bank warned in a Tuesday report.  In crypto, there are also signs of caution. “In the last week, the stablecoin dominance also increased by 0.64%, indicating a flight to safety in the crypto markets,” Arcane Research wrote in a report.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $47,854, +2.61%  Ether (ETH): $3,838, +2.09%  S&P 500: $4,634, -0.75%  Gold: $1,771, -0.80%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.43%  Bitcoin ahead of the pack  Bitcoin is starting to outperform the CoinDesk 20 index, which filters some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Altcoins have continued to struggle after the sell-off earlier this month, which could reflect a lower appetite for risk among investors.  Still, there has been one bright spot in the CoinDesk 20 this month. Polygon’s MATIC token has outperformed its peers since the crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) issuer 21Shares announced it was listing a product linked to the cryptocurrency’s performance on Euronext exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam.  Altcoin roundup  DOGE surges: Dogecoin surged as much as 33% after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the electric-car maker would accept it as payment for merchandise. “Tesla will make some merch buyable with Doge & see how it goes,” Musk tweeted.  L.O.L Surprise! In-store NFT collection: MGA Entertainment is launching a non-fungible token (NFT) collection that accompanies in-store purchases of its L.O.L. Surprise! brand trading cards, the company announced Tuesday. The release is in partnership with Ioconic, an NFT company the toy brand inked a deal with in October, CoinDesk’s Eli Tan reported.

42394348,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc98Z,1639513517,Bitcoin Is Free and Fair but Not Progressive,"Strictly speaking, Bitcoin is for everyone. I like to think about this decentralized network as a type of public commons – it’s an open ledger that anyone can append, anyone can access, anyone can take part in. (I do.) It’s bigger than any single individual, corporation or government. To this extent, Bitcoin is one of the fairest – perhaps the most fair – monetary networks today.  But progressive, Bitcoin is not. Released into the wild during the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin is an experiment with non-state money. It’s a political project, one that enshrines the values of private property and open markets.  This interview is part of Culture Week. It was published first in The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In recent months, a host of progressive-leaning pols and regs in the United States have raised their concerns about Bitcoin and crypto broadly. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for one, said a world staring down ecological crisis has no room for this carbon-intensive computer network. Especially one that is primarily used by “shadowy super-coders,” she said.  Bitcoiners have made sport out of responding to these erroneous and fatuous remarks – which, to be fair, also come from across the political aisle. There are more than a few Bitcoin superfans who lean progressive and try to make the case that the network ought to be a plank in democratic policy making.  Read more: Elizabeth Warren’s Bitcoin Blind Spot | Murtaza Hussain  Often, their reasons are sound. The neutral Bitcoin network stands distinct from the traditional financial sector, littered as it is with a history of redlining, usury and unethical behavior. If financial access is a progressive concern, then Bitcoin could play a role.  There’s also the view that miners, who use a lot of power in a process that both creates new BTC and secures the network, could incentivize green energy development in their search for the cheapest and most reliable power sources (to some extent this is already happening).  And, to be sure, there are plenty of Democratic politicians who see hope in crypto. Rep. Antonio Torres (D-N.Y.), a representative from The Bronx borough of New York City, recently asked if crypto could lower the cost of remittances for his constituents – many of which are migrants or new Americans.  But I think the attempt to rebrand Bitcoin as progressive muddies the waters. There’s no need to obfuscate what Bitcoin is, a project that stands against the state. It supports the establishment of open, global markets that are hard to regulate by design. It puts the onus of ownership on individuals. It may “bank the unbanked,” to the extent that a bitcoin wallet is a bank account, but that’s a risky proposition.  There’s a long history of progressivism in the U.S., a political ideology that seeks to mitigate the worst effects of capitalism and often calls on the federal government to play a role in managing the economy. Progressives brought us the five-day workweek and other strong labor protections. They’ve often been staunch advocates for press freedoms.  See also: Why I’m Skeptical of FATF’s ‘Extreme Right Wing’ Watch | Daniel Kuhn  Today, progressives are an ascendant political force. Their platform advocates for greater government spending to extend the welfare state, more attuned oversight on business and stronger consumer protections. It’s a cultural force. Some of the most successful podcasts and books align with this movement. Bernie Sanders, a lifelong democratic socialist, was a broadly popular candidate in 2016 and 2020 (he would’ve had my vote).  As mentioned, there are many areas where Bitcoin aligns with progressive goals – especially anywhere where personal liberty and expression come into play. But I think fundamentally it stands in contradiction. If anything, Bitcoin furthers the neoliberal agenda, which moved to turn over government resources to public-private partnerships or management by market actors beginning in the later half of the 20th century.  It’s common to hear that Bitcoin’s technology is apolitical, but it’s not. In the first Bitcoin block ever mined, its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, encoded a headline about government bailouts of banks. A Bitcoin system would limit the power of governments to respond to crises, to provide for its citizens.  None of this is to say that Bitcoin isn’t a powerful tool. And to some extent, bitcoin’s success is because it has broad appeal beyond partisan politics. But it’s important to get clear about what Bitcoin truly is, what it can actually achieve politically, because people and politicians need to come to it on their own terms.  There is nothing wrong with saying Bitcoin encodes libertarian ideals, found initial (and ongoing) support among anarcho-capitalists and is something of a Milton Friedman wet dream. Just be honest. To some extent, I think progressive bitcoiners bend over backwards to rebrand the cryptocurrency to fit their chosen identities to prevent cognitive dissonance.  If Bitcoin solved the climate crisis, it would be through successful, freer markets – not progressive planning. If Bitcoin expands access to basic financial services, it could never solve economic inequality – you cannot redistribute early Bitcoiners’ massive holdings without destroying the system’s technologically protected property rights. If Bitcoin prevents war by diminishing the power of the state, it will also dismantle the progressive welfare state.  I like Bitcoin because it protects and furthers liberal ideals of open and fair access in the digital age, but I admit how deeply regressive and reactionary the system also is. Bitcoin should be celebrated, but as it actual exists.  It’s often said that Bitcoin may not have all the answers but gets people to ask the right questions. That could have resonance for political identities. If progressives want Bitcoin to be a political cause, they should consider voting for a different party.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/14/bitcoin-is-free-and-fair-but-not-progressive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f52b51d966b3aefccd7467c5370a3f17f934e50f-8192x5464.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394344,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc8tB,1639512936,Get Ready for the 2022 Metaverse Real Estate Boom,"This time last year, if someone had said, “I’ll sell you a plot of virtual land for 1 ETH,” most of us would have told them to kick sand. Now a year later, most of us are finding that we are the ones kicking sand, and not virtual sand in the Sandbox.  Everyone in blockchain wants to be early, ahead of the curve. To everyone who believes they missed out on the latest blockchain gold rush, virtual land, think again. A more efficient and scalable future for the intersection of blockchain and real estate is being built as we speak – and it’s not solely confined to the Ethereum blockchain.  Irina Karagyaur is the head of metaverse growth at Unique Network, head ambassador for Western Europe of the Polkadot network and also London’s regional co-chair of the Foundation for International Blockchain and Real Estate Expertise. This post is part of CoinDesk’s Culture Week.  The future of NFTs (the technological standard for unique digital assets, like artwork or virtual homes) is multi-chain, a more diverse pathway that solves the limitations of the Ethereum blockchain and enhances its usage to present once unimaginable opportunities that touch multiple corners of culture and commerce.  In this multi-chain future, we will see vast opportunities and diverse use cases made possible by alternative chains like Solana, Tezos, Polkadot, Kusama, Cardano and many others. These chains bring answers for scalability, network congestion and the ability to truly fractionalize ownership, allowing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to become usable and transferable in the metaverse – breaking out of the confines of traditional digital collectibles – perhaps into the real world.  While you might not immediately associate an age-old industry like real estate with the current technological advancement of blockchain, the potential for this industry to be modernized and made efficient is powerful – even inevitable.  Anyone who has ever bought or rented a property is familiar with the inconvenient, time intensive and expensive process. There are contracts to sign, payments to be made between landlord and tenants, real estate agents and, often, mediating lawyers. These arrangements require multiple transactions, time and money.  With virtual real estate in open metaverses, we can implement peer-to-peer transactions and use smart contracts to automate and accelerate these legal processes. Smart contracts can be programmed to instantly trigger actions and execute orders as required. As a result, property assets, such as buildings, shares or funds, and debt or equity, can be automated in new ways and executed in minutes instead of weeks or months.  Virtual real estate can unlock liquidity via decentralized global markets that enable tradable assets and allow for metaverse assets to be used as extractable collateral to fuel innovative methods of lending in decentralized finance (DeFi).  Through what we hope will be an increasingly open metaverse, users can one day move digital assets and NFTs in and out of virtual worlds. Perhaps their digital homes can be used as collateral for loans. Imagine if you could borrow against a valuable piece of virtual land to acquire physical land?  This world, still being settled, will almost certainly need to be built on more than just Ethereum, the dominant smart contract network.  Ethereum’s limitations  Since Ethereum’s launch in 2015, smart contracts have gained traction in functionality and innovation. ERC-20 tokens are the most commonly used standard for tokenization. These tokens encode rights of ownership in code. The ERC-721 standard and the more advanced ERC-1155 – the technical standards for NFTs – create digital scarcity. A diversity of protocols and tokens exist on Ethereum, forming the foundation for an open metaverse.  However, the industry is rapidly expanding, and the developments on Ethereum exist on other blockchain networks as well. Although Ethereum layer 2 solutions (add-ons that help the network process more transactions) work well, new blockchains have seen exponential growth and promise fertile new ground. A rich pool of creative builders are looking beyond Ethereum and the network’s exorbitant fees.  As a consequence, the current challenge for the industry is to achieve interoperability between different blockchains. By eliminating the “silo effect” in the blockchain industry, we might finally reach “mass adoption.”  Polkadot, a blockchain I’m financially involved in, is one such alternative chain for this kind of interoperability. Due to its advanced ownership structure, it can enable the transfer of property ownership straight to other addresses, grant or prohibit third party rights to use a property for display purposes and facilitate the exchange of a deed or trust.  Goldrush  Today there is a veritable gold rush in the metaverse, with young people and celebrities like Snoop Dogg investing millions of dollars in virtual real estate. Fortune magazine called it a “multi trillion-dollar opportunity.” It’s conceivable that a new generation will purchase their first house (or a unique share of it) in the metaverse.  There’s undoubtedly a lot of work that needs to be done in this space to realize this future. As it stands, critics say that current eye-popping virtual real estate sales are more of a novelty driven by hype and speculation, compared to something that truly represents unique ownership. Others argue that real-estate – virtual or physical – requires a level of legal due diligence to ensure security and confidence between buyers and sellers.  There will also be apprehension and criticism from the traditional real estate industry, which might not see the value in disrupting their antiquated, albeit profitable model.  Still, real estate NFTs promise the ability to democratize property ownership, a space that has historically excluded a majority of the world. GoBankingRates quoted a research analyst at Grayscale Investments who noted that historically, real-estate value is largely influenced by proximity to shops, services and attractive neighborhoods. It remains to be seen if that may happen too in the metaverse, where players can “teleport around the world, making travel instantaneous and irrelevant to valuation.” Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.  As time goes on, will profiteering infect virtual land development? Will expensive plots in the Sandbox or Decentraland retain their value? Will people outside of crypto see NFTs as a powerful new tool for ownership, even if you can’t sleep inside a computer?  As it stands, NFT infrastructure is still limited. The technology isn’t there yet to allow for true unique tokenization of properties (especially on Ethereum, where it’s currently close to impossible). A new paradigm will need to be developed in order to take this sector forward.  See also: ‘Crypto-States’ Will Compete With Corporates in the Metaverse | Kelsie Nabben  In the year to come, the industry will see an injection of billions into NFT infrastructure that will support alternative use cases and enable a visible ledger that can be divided or expanded, facilitating a unique representation of individual assets, similar to art and collectibles.  Smart contracts will need to be improved to allow for speed, functionality and scalability. There is great work being done in some sectors – like “Nested NFT Palettes” that allows for sophisticated ownership relationships between holders of fractionalized property.  Regulations are also up for debate. As are the concerns of the traditional real estate industry, which really could be disrupted by free-moving assets – pinned to no single blockchain – that can be used in the real world and digital world alike.  There are social considerations of getting people to value digital property. It’s already happening. But this the new tokenized world – this multi-chain future – will take time.

42411855,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glghxw,1639508918,Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB): A Beginner’s Guide for 2023,"Shibu Inu coin isn’t new, and saw its first surge alongside dogecoin (DOGE) in 2021 as the Wallstreetbets subreddit breathed new life into meme coins, especially ones with dogs as icons. Elon Musk regularly tweeted memes and support of dogecoin and investors looked for other canine coins to invest in, with the shiba inu token (SHIB) happily benefiting from the interest.  In 2023, support for shibu inu coin continues to grow, with crypto analytics platform Nansen’s data showing that in January, SHIB was the most common non-stablecoin to appear in new wallets while also soaring with crypto natives ​​trading on both decentralized and centralized exchanges. In just one 24-hour period between Jan. 17 and Jan. 18, Nansen reported that over $1 billion in SHIB has traded hands.  Some of the movement may be attributed to the upcoming launch of Shibu Inu’s upcoming layer 2 blockchain, Shibarium, which will “focus on metaverse and gaming applications” and could strengthen the fundamentals of Shiba Inu’s three ecosystem tokens, SHIB, BONE and LEASH. But before we get into how BONE and LEASH work, we need to start with the basics of SHIB itself.  What is Shiba Inu?  Shiba inu coin (SHIB) is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token that has risen in popularity, largely because of its dog-themed ecosystem, speculation on its price by retail investors and strong community engagement. The official Shib Twitter account, for example, has over 3.6 million followers – more than leading crypto companies such as Cardano, Kraken and Solana.  The digital asset was inspired by the Japanese breed of dog of the same name, which sparked a viral meme trend in 2013 and subsequently led to the creation of the infamous dogecoin cryptocurrency. Shiba Inu, along with dogecoin and the hundreds of other pet-inspired digital assets, have become collectively known in the industry as “meme coins.”  Ordinarily, a meme coin offers owners little to no utility compared with more established cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. In the case of shiba inu coin, however, there seems to be a legitimate attempt by the development team to provide more value to SHIB holders, including launching a decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, which we’ll explain more later in the article.  Notably, the desire to provide more utility to users has seen the self-proclaimed “doge killer” become the second-most popular meme coin in the market. And although the market capitalization of dogecoin is still nearly twice that of shiba inu as of January, 2023, the underdog project has managed to create and build up a large community and narrow the gap between itself and DOGE.  What are Shiba Inu's key features?  The first notable thing about the shiba inu coin is its total supply. A fixed total supply of 1 quadrillion SHIB tokens was minted during the project’s official launch in 2020. A quadrillion is a number followed by 15 zeros. Some 50% of the supply of shiba inu was locked in Uniswap SHIB/ETH liquidity pool – a decentralized exchange where users deposit pairs of assets into liquidity pools that other investors can trade against. That is known as an automated market maker system.  The other 50% of SHIB token’s supply was donated to Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, who burned a vast majority of them by sending the tokens to a dead crypto wallet address. The remaining tokens (worth $1.2 billion at the time) were donated to an Indian COVID-19 relief cause and other charities.  The Shiba Inu universe also consists of two other tokens, “LEASH” and “BONE” (see below).  The community also champions a rescue campaign for Shiba Inu dogs. Until recently, you could support it through purchases on Amazon through smile.amazon.com and select Shiba Inu Rescue Association (a 501(c)3 as your preferred nongovernmental organization), but Amazon is currently winding down their Smile program.  What is ShibaSwap?  ShibaSwap is a decentralized exchange – a type of peer-to-peer trading platform similar to Uniswap that allows users to trade SHIB and other cryptocurrencies without an intermediary company. It also features the “Shiboshis” non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.  ShibaSwap allows users to provide liquidity (deposit funds into pools that other traders can use to trade against) and stake tokens (deposit them into a smart contract) to earn interest using SHIB token and two additional ERC-20 tokens that exist within the Shiba ecosystem; Bone ShibaSwap token (BONE) and Doge Killer token (LEASH). BONE serves as the community's governance token. LEASH launched as a rebase or elastic token, with it’s supply adjusted to track the price of DOGE at a rate of 1/1,000.  LEASH tokens have since been “unleashed,” and now serve mainly as a store of value for investors.  Read more: What is ShibaSwap?  Who created SHIB coin?  Shiba inu coin launched in August 2020 as a direct competitor to Dogecoin. But unlike Dogecoin, the mysterious creator(s) of Shiba Inu, known as Ryoshi, made some design decisions that have since set the token apart. According to Ryoshi, SHIB has “the ability to outpace the value of dogecoin, exponentially, without ever crossing the $0.01 mark.” To put that into perspective, SHIB was trading for $0.000025 at press time, which is a long way from $0.01. And yet, its market cap has already reached a third of Dogecoin’s market cap.  Read more: How Dogecoin Became So Popular  As noted above, following the launch of Shiba Inu, Ryoshi transferred half of the token’s total supply to Buterin, while the other half was locked in Uniswap, a decentralized exchange. As written in the project’s white paper, which the shib community calls the woofpaper, the goal was to transfer ownership of 500 trillion SHIB to Buterin with the hope he would lock them away forever. Unlike dogecoin, where new coins enter circulation in perpetuity via mining, all of Shiba Inu coin’s supply was released at launch.  What is Shibarium?  Shibarium is a layer 2 solution for Ethereum. Layer 2s reduce bottlenecks and lower the cost to transact by bundling multiple off-chain transactions into a single transaction on the layer 1 or mainnet, in this case Ethereum.  In a blog post, the developers wrote the focus will be on the Metaverse, gaming and NFTs as well as be used as a cheap settlement for decentralized applications (dapps) built on Shibarium. Every transaction will burn SHIB tokens, but the details are still to be determined.

42411865,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgibc,1639508603,What Is ShibaSwap?,"ShibaSwap is the native decentralized exchange (DEX) of the shiba inu coin project; a popular meme coin and leading competitor of dogecoin that has risen to fame over the last 18 months. DEXs operate differently from centralized platforms such as Binance and Kraken by allowing users to swap tokens without the need for an intermediary or counterparty.  Launched in July 2021, the ShibaSwap exchange provides many of the same functions you would find on Uniswap and other decentralized exchanges, such as token swapping and liquidity pools, with the addition of other features such as staking, governance and a “Shiboshis” non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.  Read More: Shiba Inu: Memes Are the Future of Money  Fueling ShibaSwap is the project’s main token, shiba inu coin (SHIB), and two other tokens built using Ethereum’s ERC-20 blueprint, bone shibaSwap (BONE) and doge killer (LEASH).  What is bone shibaSwap (BONE) and doge killer (LEASH)?  Bone shibaSwap (ticker: BONE): BONE is designed to function as the platform’s governance token, with a total supply of 250 million coins. That means holders of BONE tokens are able to propose and vote on changes to the ShibaSwap protocol via its “Doggy DAO.” It’s also minted and rewarded to users who provide liquidity on the platform.  Doge killer (ticker: LEASH): This was originally launched as a rebase token (also known as an elastic token), a type of token similar to an algorithmic stablecoin where the supply automatically increases and decreases via a computer algorithm to keep its price pegged to another asset. In this case, LEASH’s supply was adjusted to track the price of DOGE at a rate of 1/1,000.  For example, if the price of dogecoin was $0.05, the supply of doge killer would change (mint new tokens or destroy coins in circulation) to adjust the price of LEASH to $50.  LEASH tokens have since been “unleashed,” and now no longer track the price of DOGE. With a scarce supply of just 107,647 tokens, LEASH has instead become the main store of value coin for the project’s investors.  How ShibaSwap works  On the ShibaSwaphomepage, there are six functions available that incorporate ShibaSwap's three native coins, SHIB, LEASH and BONE.  Dig: Digging is the liquidity pool function on the ShibaSwap platform. Here, users can deposit crypto assets in pairs to existing liquidity pools on the platform or create their own. As a reward, liquidity providers receive ShibaSwap liquidity pool tokens (SSLP). Those tokens represent their share of liquidity in the pool and entitle holders to receive free bone tokens upon redemption.  Woof: “Woofing” is the function for redeeming BONE rewards by cashing out SSLP tokens on the ShibSwap platform.  Bury: This refers to where users can stake their SHIB, LEASH and BONE in order to generate high-interest yields paid in BONE tokens. At press time, the rates were 171%, 266% and 814%, respectively. Once staked, users receive a token that represents their staked amount in xSHIB, xLEASH or xBONE.  Thirty-three percent of BONE rewards from staking are available immediately, while the remaining 66% are locked up for six months.  Swap: This is the exchange feature of the ShibaSwap platform where users can swap between multiple assets.  Bonefolio: This is an analytics dashboard where users can explore current interest rates and track their yield returns.  NFTs: Here, users can trade 10,000 unique non-fungible tokens called “Shiboshis” – pixelated Shiba Inu dog cartoons similar to CryptoPunks with different traits, some rarer than others.  How to get started with ShibaSwap  In order to start using the ShibaSwap platform, users will need to set up one of three compatible crypto wallet services:  Metamask  WalletConnect  Coinbase Wallet  Simply head over to the official landing pages, click either “Get Started” or “Download” and follow the steps until you’ve created your own wallet.  There are two things you’ll need to do once your wallet is set up. First, you’ll need to make a copy of the secret phrase, also known as a seed phrase or recovery phrase. It’s important not to create a digital copy of this phrase, such as taking a screenshot or sending the phrase to yourself in an email. This makes it accessible to hackers should your device become compromised. Instead, it’s always recommended you write down the phrase on paper.  For maximum security, write the same phrase down on multiple pieces of paper and store each copy in a different, safe location.  Secondly, you’ll need to fund the wallet with an amount of ether to cover transaction fees and to convert into SHIB, BONE or LEASH tokens if you want to begin staking or providing liquidity, as mentioned above.  Read more: How to Buy Shiba Inu Coin  Once you’ve funded your wallet, simply connect your wallet by clicking the “Connect” icon in the top right corner of the official ShibaSwap website and select the appropriate wallet service. This will link your wallet to the platform and allow you to interact with ShibaSwap’s services.  Is ShibaSwap safe?  According to blockchain security ranking service CertiK, ShibaSwap has a current safety score of 93/100 and resolved 97% of the 34 issues raised during the platform’s extensive audit. This puts ShibaSwap above the likes of decentralized finance (DeFi) heavyweights Aave and Polygon, which both scored 92/100.  In addition to this, 96% of CertiK users voted they felt ShibaSwap was a secure service. However, this metric should not be relied upon alone when assessing a platform’s safety.

The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) is an on-chain indicator that measures the difference between the unrealized profit and loss to check whether the market as a whole is currently in a state of profit or loss. The metric measures this by looking at what price each coin on the chain was bought at, and comparing it with the current price. When the value of the indicator is below zero, it means the overall Bitcoin network is in a state of profit at the moment.

42421216,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgriX,1639508428,How Brands Can Build in the Metaverse,"Clinique had a problem. The brand wanted to “enter the metaverse,” but it didn’t want to do it in a way that was cringey. So, they called a woman named Cathy Hackl: The “Godmother of the Metaverse.”  Her credentials? Hackl, the “Chief Metaverse Officer” of Futures Intelligence Group, has worked in metaverse-related fields for nearly a decade – or basically since the dawn of meta-time.  This post is part of Crypto 2022: Culture Week.  Just ask Steven Spielberg. When filming “Ready Player One,” Spielberg partnered with the virtual reality headset company HTC Vive, where Hackl served as “VR Evangelist.” At Magic Leap, an augmented reality company, she worked with the man who coined the term metaverse, Neal Stephenson. And over a year before the current craze, she wrote articles for Forbes like “The Metaverse Is Coming And It’s A Very Big Deal.”  It was such a big deal that Hackl left a cushy job at Amazon Web Services to “take a big bet on the metaverse.” Now she advises brands – like Clinique – on how to position themselves in this strange new space. (Her work with Clinique fetched a glowing write-up from Vogue business.)  The Godmother shares why the metaverse is larger than perhaps the crypto crowd realizes, why avatars are fast becoming “emotional surrogates of ourselves,” and how in the future, “every company is going to need a metaverse strategy.”  The term “metaverse” can mean 10 different things to 10 different people – even inside the crypto space. When you start working with clients, how do you explain it to them?  Cathy Hackl: I usually start from the past. Web 1 connected information, so you got the internet. And did that change anything for your brand? It probably did. Web 2 connected people and you got social media, the sharing economy. Did that change anything for your brand? Of course it did, right?  Right.  And now we’re in the evolution of Web 2 going into Web 3. And Web 3, it connects people, places, and things – or people, spaces and assets. And those people, spaces and assets can sometimes be in a fully virtual environment, like most people tend to think.  Read more: Play-to-Earn Is Already the Biggest Star in the Metaverse - Jeff Wilser  But it’s also going to be in our real world with some level of augmentation, probably through a wearable. So, Web 3 is kind of enabling the creation of the metaverse, and the metaverse is a convergence of physical and digital. Think of it as the successor of what comes next on the internet. It’s like your digital lifestyle catching up to your physical life.  That’s a pretty expansive view. So, it includes not just blockchain projects, like Decentraland, but also augmented reality from traditional platforms?  Yeah. Even Snapchat, the things that they can do with the camera for augmented reality – that’s a metaverse play. That’s all part of the metaverse. I have a pretty expansive view, and part of that comes from working in VR [virtual reality] hardware, spatial computing and augmented reality hardware. And when people think the metaverse is only virtual reality, or only fully immersive, I think that’s a pretty narrow view. And a pretty dystopic one.  With that wide of a definition, I’m guessing the blockchain metaverse projects are only a small slice of the overall “metaverse pie”?  It is small, but it’s ever increasing. You’ve got SoftBank leading the investment for $93 million in a Series B [for The Sandbox]. Upland just raised $18 million, I believe, with a $300 million valuation. You’ve got a lot of these blockchain projects – like NFT [non-fungible token] gaming metaverses – growing really fast.  How does blockchain fit into your vision for the metaverse?  You cannot enable the open decentralized metaverse that many of us dream of without blockchain, right? Blockchain is the underlying component. NFTs are a bit of a stepping-stone into the metaverse when it comes to ownership of digital assets and digital identity. How do you actually enable that? NFTs are a big part of that equation.  What’s the biggest potential for brands?  One of the big things that I try to explore is, “Is direct-to-avatar the next direct-to-consumer?” Again, it’s stepping-stones. When we text people we use emojis; we don’t even write anymore. We use an emoji to represent a message. Our emojis – and by extension our avatars – are becoming emotional surrogates of ourselves.  In order to represent yourself as an avatar, that’s a big thing. Because it’s a moment of self-expression, it’s a moment of self-exploration. And how do brands play into that? Well, I’m going to have to outfit my avatar. Maybe I want to make a statement and wear Supreme. Fashion and culture go together. How does your avatar show up, right? What does it look like, what does it wear? There are going to be a lot of opportunities for brands. And there will be opportunities for them to engage with the younger generation.  I can see how it’s obvious for some brands – especially in wearables and fashion – to get involved in the avatar game. But how about for less obvious brands? I mean, how does a food company make a metaverse play?  This post is part of Crypto 2022: Culture Week.  Well, people are saying that Chipotle caused the [Roblox] outage. (Of course they didn’t cause the outage – let’s get that straight.) But a brand like Chipotle can come in and say, “We’re going to do a burrito, and we’re going to give away $1 million worth of burritos in the game.” I think those types of things are interesting and fun, and the audience is engaged, they enjoyed it.  What do you see as some of the biggest obstacles that need to be overcome for the metaverse to become more mainstream?  There are a lot of things that need to happen. If you look at how many people actually have [digital] wallets, it’s actually a very small number. And it’s a generational thing. My kids understand digital ownership in a way that maybe older generations don’t. They love buying digital assets and their skins. Once my kids get older, they’re going to question, “Why can’t I take this asset that I paid so much money for in Roblox, and move it over to Fortnite?” Eventually they’re going to expect that.  And that leads to more of an appreciation for NFTs and a desire for open worlds, got it. What else is needed for the metaverse to take off?  There will be a serious need for computing power. And right now, obviously you’ve got supply chain issues related to chips, so that might slow things down.  There also needs to be a lot of education within organizations – and not just the brand team – to understand where this is headed. And for companies, there’s already a talent war so it’s hard to hire people. When you realize that every company is going to need a metaverse strategy, then hiring is going to get even harder. That’s why I partnered with Republic Realm to create the Republic Realm Academy, for executive education.  How does Facebook fit into all of this? What’s your reaction to Zuckerberg’s meta play?  I take the good with the bad. I mean, it is a validation of the work that many of us have been doing for years. So, I’ll take that. On the other side, with Facebook being so literal with the name “meta,” it does cast a bit of doubt and shadow on the metaverse. The big thing is confusion – people thinking the metaverse is Facebook. It is not.  I was at an event having breakfast with some speakers. I sat down, and someone asked me what I do. I said, “I do metaverse strategies.” And they said, “Isn’t that Facebook?”  Read More: Note to Brands: Crypto Isn’t Funny Money. It’s Community  No!  [Laughs.] Yeah. So, I think there is that level of confusion. I don’t know how many people read the news that Facebook rebranded to meta, and they learned the word because of that.  How many years until we get to a “Ready Player One”-style metaverse?  First of all, I will say “The Oasis” [the fully immersive platform in “Ready Player One”] is not what we should aim for. That’s pretty dystopic, where the real world has gone to s**t, and you have to escape reality. [Laughs.] I don’t want to escape reality, but I want the metaverse to be somewhere fun when I want to have fun – instead of Instagram.  So how long until we get there?  I don’t think anyone can put a time or date, but I will say that this decade is a decade of building and pioneering. We’re all testing, trying to understand how it all works.

It’s an environment in which Ethereum- and Solana-based gaming studio Ex Populus is attempting to find its footing, one that co-founder Soban “Soby” Saqib calls a “predatory” investment landscape built on hype.  The project announced Tuesday an $8.5 million funding round, part of a push to bring different player earnings models to blockchain gaming – and a more down-to-earth valuation, currently at $80 million.  The company closed the round with participation from Akatsuki Inc, Gerstenbrot Capital, Blockwall Digital Assets, Citizen X, Fisher 8 Capital, Perpetual Protocol, Yolo Ventures, Libra Capital Ventures, 8186 Capital and Sneaky Ventures, among others. Ex Populus also previously raised a $3 million seed round led by Animoca Brands in October.  “We think as more people start this play-to-earn model, there will be a supply shock and a race to the bottom,” Saqib said in an interview with CoinDesk.  He compared the phenomena to forks of popular decentralized (DeFi) protocols that “out-bribe” other platforms by printing tokens. In the same way, blockchain games can currently reach large market capitalizations but offer little by way of players, earnings or other important metrics.  Read more: Solana Ventures Looks to Boost Web 3 Gaming With Launch of $150M Fund  Ex Populus is also hoping to attract attention with a novel token distribution method: 40% of the platform’s forthcoming token supply will be earned by players, with the majority going to the best players in a “proof-of-skill” distribution system – a play on “proof-of-stake” and “proof-of-work,” two foundational consensus and mining mechanisms in blockchain.  The company’s long-term goal is to become a multi-game platform and publisher, similar to Steam or Enjin. Blockchain gaming platform Enjin is also an investor in Ex Populus, according to Saqib.  Currently, Ex Populus has two games in development: LAMO, a shooter with NFT-backed collectibles, and Decentralized Autonomous GigaUnits, a trading card game that will be accompanied by an animated series, with more in development.  “That’s what I’m excited about – bringing really good, complete games into the ecosystem, because I don’t understand how people can go and buy something at a $20, $30, $40 billion valuation. Nintendo is at a $42 billion valuation.

42420836,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlMT,1639507898,The Elon Effect: How Musk’s Tweets Move Crypto Markets,"In the early stages of 2021, Elon Musk had the cryptocurrency market wrapped around his finger.  A single tweet about dogecoin by the Tesla and SpaceX founder sent prices flying as much as 50%. For a time, bitcoin price action seemed reliant on the opinion of the world’s richest man.  Tuesday offered a bit of deja vu: Musk’s tweet that Tesla would be accepting DOGE for merch sent the meme coin soaring 43%.  This post is part of CoinDesk’s Culture Week.  Musk is far from the only person to move the crypto market for no apparent reason other than making an endorsement. A sizable portion of the industry from meme coins to NFTs has proven to be highly responsive to celebrity shilling.  Inspired by Jeff Wilser’s profile of Musk for CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021 series, here is a look into the role social media and celebrities play in the crypto market and how it has changed over the course of the year.  Trying to measure the exact impact any single event has on the market is often futile, but the correlation between dogecoin’s rise and Musk’s praise is undeniable. While other billionaires (such as Mark Cuban) and celebrities hopped on the DOGE bandwagon, Musk was often the most outspoken in his attempts at memeing the canine cryptocurrency “to the moon.”  Musk’s Top 3 most impactful tweets:  On Feb. 4 he sent a string of tweets professing his love for DOGE, sending the price flying nearly 10% within the hour and over 50% within a day.  “You can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin”: One of the largest companies in the world accepting BTC as payment helped push the asset to new highs; BTC would reach nearly $65,000 within a month of the tweet.  On Dec. 14, Musk announced Tesla would trial run accepting DOGE for merchandise and the price subsequently jumped 43% over the next two hours.  Musk eventually found himself within the bitcoin conversation and Tesla played a vital role in price action throughout the spring. Disclosing Tesla’s purchase of BTC, accepting BTC as payment, eventually selling a portion of the BTC holdings and canceling BTC as a payment method all had significant effects on the market, amplifying crypto assets’ already considerable volatility.  On Feb. 8, Tesla announced its purchase of $1.5 billion in BTC and the price skyrocketed 19.5% from $38,850 to $46,400 within the day. The amount of BTC bought by Tesla and used to purchase its vehicles was relatively small compared to daily trading volume on the nearly $1 trillion asset, yet it controlled the narrative in the market for months. On May 12, an “Elon effect” of a different sort took place when the CEO announced Tesla would no longer accept BTC as payment. While the market had already fallen hard off of its highs in the months before, this tweet put the nail in the coffin, sending the price of BTC from $56,800 to $49,500.  However, Musk’s impact on prices diminished over the course of the year. Has the market grown stronger or are participants simply sick of hearing from him? Perhaps the billionaire wore out his welcome or perhaps the market became more rational. BTC was able to withstand a three-month bear market over the summer and retake April’s highs this fall without the constant help from Musk. DOGE had fallen from its glory and “the dogefather’s” latest dogecoin-themed tweets struggled to excite the market.  Or so it seemed until Tuesday morning.  The chart below tracks Musk’s influence on the DOGE price over time, using data from TradingView.  In any event, high-profile celebrities and Twitter accounts sowing FOMO (fear of missing out) are likely here to stay.  The power of social media in the crypto market is testament to the general lack of regulation and maturity, and the inherent liquidity of 24/7, permissionless assets. For example, non-fungible tokens in their current form are essentially “tradable culture” with features (bespoke assets, thin liquidity, anonymous participants) that make prices easy to manipulate through bogus “wash” trades. Therefore, when a star like pro basketball’s Steph Curry purchased an NFT from the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, the average sales price for this line of virtual tchotchkes nearly doubled in the following months.  The market will likely continue to mature with further regulation and innovation. If so, celebrity influence will continue to diminish as it seemingly has for Musk. While crypto natives are still very fond of the occasional meme coin , blockchain technology has showcased its potential and attracted real investors and billions of dollars in institutional capital.  The depths of crypto will likely remain the Wild West, but hopefully we have seen the worst of it.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Edward Oosterbaan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2021/12/14/the-elon-effect-how-musks-tweets-move-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8cb16478050d033bc865a31503aabd789c38467e-1440x1013.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42396342,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2mbZ,1639507864,Binance Is Threatening to Block UK Derivatives Traders in a Move to Keep Regulators at Bay,"Binance.com is cutting off U.K. retail investors from accessing crypto derivatives in order to comply with local regulations, the exchange told its users on Tuesday.  The notice, reviewed by CoinDesk, says U.K. users will be required to “provide additional information” before they can continue to access futures, margin, leveraged tokens, options and Binance EARN- Dual Investment products on the platform.  “This information will help us to determine whether your access to these products is permitted under local regulatory requirements or will be restricted,” the notice said.  In June, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said Binance isn’t allowed to conduct any regulated activity in the jurisdiction. Following the notice, Binance signaled it was working on getting an FCA approval. Earlier this month, the firm’s CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao told the Sunday Telegraph that Binance has hired a “number of ex-regulatory staff from the U.K. and a couple of hundred compliance people” to bolster efforts to register with the FCA.  The notice was sent directly to users; at publication time, there were no official announcements of the requirement on the firm’s official country Twitter page or website. The firm also did not specify the regulations it is looking to comply with through these new restrictions.  “This is a requirement to comply with local regulations,” a spokesperson for Binance said in an email to CoinDesk. “Binance is committed to full compliance, globally. This is a proactive measure to ensure that our product offering is welcomed by users and local regulators.”  Last year, the FCA placed a ban on selling derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETN) that reference certain types of crypto assets. The ban came into effect in January.  Binance users in the U.K. who registered with the platform before Dec. 14, 2021, will have until Feb. 14, 2022, to provide the required information, which will be collected via a pop-up form when attempts are made to access these products, the notice said.  The notice did not specify the information that would be requested but a spokesperson for Binance said there are a number of options available in the declaration form to allow users to “most accurately categorize themselves.”  One user who goes by Rzulfcut tweeted that the pop-up form asked if he is a “private investor.” Upon confirming that he was, his access to the aforementioned products was immediately restricted, according to his tweets.  “Was expecting a longer journey/more questions so I could stop the process on the last page but nope, it was just one question without any submission confirmation,” he tweeted.  Another user, Kongming Riot, tweeted: “If you answer this form, you will lose the access immediately. I just filled this form.”  Binance did not confirm these immediate restrictions but clarified that restricted access means “users will only be able to close, reduce and/or redeem positions.”  “For derivatives, users can top up their margin balance to prevent margin calls and liquidations. Other products and platform functions on Binance will not be affected,” a Binance spokesperson said.  Following the publication of the article, Binance reached out to clarify that margin products are not subject to restrictions although it is mentioned in the notice sent out to users.  UPDATE (Dec. 15, 10:47 UTC): Clarifies that Binance.com and not Binance UK is imposing these restrictions.  UPDATE (Dec. 15, 10:47 UTC): Adds additional comment from Binance in last paragraph clarifying that margin products are not affected by the restrictions.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/14/binance-uk-is-threatening-to-block-derivatives-traders-in-a-move-to-keep-regulators-at-bay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/609381562dde3f40108416d1ea8633d8ac192d0c-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There are two broad ways that users can store their cryptocurrency assets. Hot-wallets (software wallets) can operate on the web or through internet-enabled devices, and Cold wallets, which are physical devices that can store crucial crypto access keys. So far in 2021, Overall losses of funds across decentralized ledgers have exceeded $12 billion. Fraud and theft accounted for 90% of that sum, while 10% was due to crucial user errors such as loss of private keys, transfer of funds to wrong addresses, etc. This indicates that software wallets and custodial wallets carry a significantly higher risk. With Cold storage, on the other hand, assets are stored offline, and consequently, the risk of loss due to hacks, fraud, and operational lapses is mitigated. Experts widely agree that cold wallets are the safest and most secure way to store ...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/cold-crypto-storage-how-to-never-lose-access-to-your-money/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

This high growth rate has led investors to look for ways to hedge for inflation. Now, gold has always been the standard inflation hedge.

However, investors have begun to flee gold as its returns have dropped significantly below the inflation rate, making it an unsuitable hedge.

FTX.US will become the San Francisco-based team’s official cryptocurrency platform and marketplace for NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. The franchise will start using the platform to sell NFTs in early 2022.  FTX branding will also appear on the basketball pole pads and press table for the Santa Cruz Warriors, the team’s G League affiliate. The G League is the NBA’s official minor league basketball organization.  Terms of the deal were not made public. According to a CNBC report citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, it is worth about $10 million.  A spokesperson for FTX declined to comment on the deal’s value.  “In our conversations with FTX, we quickly realized our joint desire to innovate around cryptocurrency integration and adoption, including the role NFTs play in global fan engagement,” said Warriors President and Chief Operating Officer Brandon Schneider.  Crypto companies are piling into sports as a way of getting broader brand recognition. Last month, Crypto.com paid a reported $700 million to rename the Los Angeles Staples Center. In March, FTX secured naming rights to the Miami Heat Arena for $135 million, and in August it signed a $17.5 million, 10-year agreement with Cal Athletics for the naming rights to the field at California Memorial Stadium.  To mark the agreement, FTX.US and the Warriors will give three bitcoin to local organizations that address educational equity.  In April, the Golden State Warriors began auctioning a series of commemorative NFTs. The collection included various editions of the team’s six NBA Championship rings and 10 commemorative ticket stubs. The sale finished with its 1-of-1 6x World Championship Ring selling for 285.111 ETH at $871,591.27.

42396345,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2mgU,1639497692,Bitcoin Struggles to Break $47K as Fed Meeting Looms,"Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was lower as the market prepares for this week’s Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting, where the U.S. central bank is expected to slow down its money printer.  The two-day meeting, which starts Tuesday and concludes Wednesday, is expected to end with the Fed announcing plans to cut the pace of its $120 billion-a-month of asset purchases by $30 billion every month, or double the current rate of reduction. Some cryptocurrency traders and investors say the stimulus program has bolstered bitcoin’s allure as an inflation hedge, so a reversal of the loose-money policy might be bearish.  Bitcoin, which tends to trade in tandem with traditional markets, started December around $57,000 and is now trading around the $46,600 mark. The cryptocurrency is down over 30% from its all-time high in November.  Why is bitcoin down?  Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, attributed the cryptocurrency’s recent drop to the market uncertainty leading investors to take risk off the table. Bitcoin is seen by some investors as a risk-on asset, which generally refers to assets that have a significant degree of price volatility such as industrial metals, equities and commodities. All things being equal, tighter monetary policy would theoretically make these risk-on assets less attractive.  Investors are hesitant to buy bitcoin at current levels, according to Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya. Traders may anticipate one last major push lower for the cryptocurrency, which could see it test the $40,000 level before bulls want to aggressively buy back in, he said.  Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital, said he doesn’t anticipate an imminent move upwards for the cryptocurrency based on liquidations and trading volumes. He said a break above $50,000 may happen at a much slower pace than many had hoped.  “The U.S. has woken up and bought on anticipated lower bitcoin prices, which has pushed the price up slightly but it is still under pressure,” concluded Kssis.  “There appears to be a strong feeling of uncertainty over market direction, despite strong indicators across various charts,” said Quantum Economics crypto analyst Jason Deane.  Fear and greed  Short-term sentiment and confidence levels for the cryptocurrency – check out the Fear and Greed Index – appear to be playing a stronger role than long-term fundamentals, such as all-time highs in active addresses and hash rate, according to Deane.  The Fear and Greed Index, a tool used by some investors to gauge the market, has now signaled “extreme fear” for almost one month straight.  The last time the index read a prolonged fearful market sentiment was at the start of the summer in the Northern Hemisphere, when market sentiment was “fearful” for almost two months straight, according to Arcane Research’s weekly report.  “We expect the uncertainty to remain the predominant consideration for the time being until there is enough momentum to break through,” said Deane.

TeraWulf went public after it agreed in June to merge with Ikonics, an imaging technology company whose stock traded on Nasdaq. The ticker changed to “WULF” from “IKNX” on Tuesday.  “Completing the business combination takes us one step closer to achieving our mission of generating environmentally sustainable bitcoin at industrial scale in the United States while using over 90% zero-carbon energy,” said Paul Prager, CEO of TeraWulf, in a statement.  The shares of crypto miners, which are highly correlated to the price of the digital assets they mine, have declined sharply recently after the price of bitcoin fell to near $47,000 after reaching an all-time high in November. On Tuesday, TeraWulf shares fell 29.8% to $20.30.  TeraWulf, which expects to mine bitcoin powered by nuclear, hydro and solar energy, recently raised $200 million in debt and equity financing, which it will use to reach mining power of 6 exahash per second by the second half of 2022.  In the financing round, several high-profile investors, including actress Gwyneth Paltrow, actress and comedian Mindy Kaling and Canadian comedian Lilly Singh collectively made an eight-digit equity investment in the company, according to an emailed statement.  “TeraWulf is positioned to mine zero-carbon bitcoin domestically at an industrial scale. And, equally crucial, the highly experienced management team is passionate about diversity and inclusion, reflected in their executive team and the fact that they welcomed us with open arms not simply as an investor, but as a true partner,” Paltrow said in a statement announcing the funding.

Chainlink approached AccuWeather’s Matt Vitebsky, the firm’s director of flagship products, earlier this year. Vitebsky said he’s had a personal interest in blockchain technology since 2017.  “One of the important use cases is parametric insurance, and crop insurance is definitely a big one,” Vitebsky said in an interview. “Being able to cut out that middleman in some countries that are perhaps underserved in terms of insurance.

Former Morgan Stanley executive Matthew Flood will lead business development of its U.S. operations, with startup veteran Jack Song directing communications, the company said Tuesday.  Both positions were created to accelerate the company’s growth in that market, Hashdex said. It will also lean into pre-existing relationships with U.S. investing companies to create crypto products that appeal to more traditional investors.  Before joining Hashdex, which is best known in Brazil for having launched several crypto ETFs, Flood served as a business development executive at Morgan Stanley and previously held positions in the bank’s Wealth Management division, as well as at UBS Asset Management and Mercer Consulting.  Song, the head of corporate communications, will also be chief of staff in the U.S.  Previously, Song specialized in global technology communications and worked with companies such as transportation-focused Lime, Grabango and venture-backed startups, Hashdex said.  In June, Hashdex partnered with U.S.-based asset manager Victory Capital to launch crypto investment products in the U.S. market. Victory Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index Fund, the first product released, was a private fund aimed at accredited investors, Hashdex added.  As head of Hashdex’s business development in the U.S., Flood “will focus on expanding U.S. distribution and fund product access along with Hashdex’s partner, Victory Capital,” the company stated.  In February, Hashdex also teamed up with the Nasdaq stock exchange to create the Nasdaq Crypto Index and launch the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF.

42411129,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7SCx,1639490400,"CoinDesk Indices Launches the Digital Asset Classification Standard, a Roadmap for Investing","The digital asset industry has grown at a rapid pace since the inception of bitcoin in 2008, accelerating greatly over the few years. This booming new asset class, now worth more than $3 trillion, has produced thousands of different projects with a wide variety of use cases and applications.  That extraordinary growth has created a commensurate amount of complexity. To help investors better understand the digital asset space, CoinDesk Indices is introducing the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). The DACS will provide the market with structure and transparency to help classify and simplify the industries inside the asset class.  Using a classification standard to define markets is not a new concept. The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), developed by MSCI and Standard & Poor’s in 1999, is widely used by equity investors to classify over 26,000 publicly traded companies globally. Research shows GICS explains stock return co-movements within sectors, helping investors determine important drivers for company valuations, identify relative value opportunities by comparing companies in the same sector and develop macro insights on sectors to make asset allocation decisions.  Furthermore, sector indices developed based on GICS have become the backbone for investors’ allocation, risk and performance-evaluation models. According to a recent IIA benchmark survey, nearly half of the equity indices are sector- or industry-based, which really speaks to the power of GICS to modernize equity investing.  See also: Digital Asset Classification Standard Frequently Asked Questions  While DACS is unique to digital assets, it will serve many of the same functions as classification systems used for traditional asset classes. Among other things, DACS provides the market with a transparent and standardized method to determine sector and industry exposure, facilitates portfolio attribution analysis and will help pinpoint investment opportunities.  What DACS brings to investors  DACS can help investors identify investment opportunities by industry across digital assets. It can also be instrumental in evaluating the impact of sector trends on a portfolio, analyzing sector contributions to performance and measuring the degree of exposure to specific sectors versus benchmarks and peers. Lastly, it can help portfolio managers build well-defined sector-focused and sector-rotation strategies, and further attribute returns and risk by industry group and industry to best manage the sector strategies.  While some early efforts exist to classify digital assets by their use cases, the complexity has rapidly grown, so a hierarchical structure is needed to help investors navigate digital assets at different granularity levels. DACS provides a non-ambiguous structure throughout its hierarchy – meaning each digital asset is only assigned to one industry, which is included in only one industry group, which is included in only one sector.  Here’s what the framework looks like:  DACS is a three-tier system that contains six sectors, 21 industry groups and 36 industries. The six sectors at the top level consider the main feature that defines a digital asset. The industry groups and industries support more specificity in use case and implementation differences. The DACS will be reviewed at least monthly to reflect the latest development in the digital asset market.  Also, DACS is universal, with the ability to cover most digital assets globally. It will always be current thanks to periodic reviews to ensure the framework adapts to reflect the quickly evolving digital asset landscape.

42375713,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwABTx,1639489414,Institutional Bitcoin Broker NYDIG Valued at $7B in Whopping $1B Funding Round,"NYDIG said Tuesday it raised a stunning $1 billion in a funding round that will value the firm at over $7 billion – and potentially expand bitcoin’s reach into “any industry,” CEO Robert Gutmann said in a statement.  The round was led by WestCap and joined by Bessemer Venture Partners, FinTech Collective and existing investors Affirm, FIS, Fiserv, MassMutual, Morgan Stanley and New York Life, a press release said.  The magnitude of the raise reflects NYDIG’s move to become something of a hybrid in terms of Bitcoin infrastructure, straddling both the institutional trading realm and also looking ahead toward consumer uses, NYDIG Chief Innovation Officer Patrick Sells told CoinDesk.  Sells likened the firm’s various partnerships, wallet integrations and infrastructure to something like AWS in the traditional web space – hence the large amount of interest in joining the funding round.  ”Instead of trying to build a retail crypto exchange that was out competing for customers, we wanted to empower incumbents to be able to offer access to bitcoin in a variety of ways,” Sells said in an interview.  This involves a mission to embed Bitcoin wallets into anyone’s application, which could be a bank offering crypto trading or hospitality brand Landry’s giving customers bitcoin rewards.  “The round is what it is because that value proposition has resonated across the entire country,” Sells said. “Starting next year, America is going to see bitcoin showing up everywhere in all kinds of applications. And that’s the NYDIG business model.”  As for powering the new approach, Tuesday’s press release touts plans to “further develop NYDIG’s institutional-grade Bitcoin platform using recent upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol with capabilities such as Bitcoin and Lightning payments, asset tokenization and smart contracts.”  NYDIG, which offers bitcoin trading and custody, raised $200 million back in March of this year, led by Morgan Stanley, New York Life and MassMutual. A month later it raised another $100 million.  Tuesday’s billion-dollar raise tops crypto exchange FTX’s $900 million funding round announced in July.  Reflecting the currently heady state of crypto venture capital, FTX is said to be raising a $1.5 billion funding round at a $32 billion valuation.  Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, is currently trading at $47,211, down nearly 30% over the past month.

The pilot will test the digital currency’s effectiveness in public employee payroll, peer-to-peer payments and merchant payments.  Valeriy Danilenko, Tascombank’s deputy chairman who is responsible for e-commerce, said the pilot is supported by Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation and all “e-money activities” by the commercial bank are under the regulatory supervision of the central bank, NBU. According to the statement, the electronic hryvnia will be built under Ukraine’s existing e-money legislationhttps://old.bank.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=40002060&cat_id=40002056, and the pilot is anticipated to kick off in 2022.  “We aim to conduct a pilot in the shortest reasonable time, and we are working on this together with partners and stakeholders in Ukraine,” Danilenko said in an email to CoinDesk. He did not specify the duration of the test.  Monetary authorities the world over are amping up research and trials of central bank digital currencies (CBDC). According to the Atlantic Council’s CBDC tracker, around 80 countries are actively exploring digital currencies backed by central banks. Most recently, in November, Nigeria launched the eNaira, reportedly recording nearly 500,000 wallet downloads in the first three weeks. In October, the European Central Bank kicked off a two-year experiment into a retail CBDC, one that can be used by consumers for making or receiving payments.  Ukraine, too, has been laying the groundwork for the potential launch of an electronic hryvnia. In early July, the nation’s parliament passed a law regulating payment methods that listed a future CBDC in the same category as cash or electronic money. In late July, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed into law a bill that would allow the NBU to issue a CBDC.  The upcoming pilot “will serve as a technological basis for the issuance of electronic money, and is the next key step to advance innovation of payment and financial infrastructure in Ukraine,” said Oleksandr Bornyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation in the statement.  The statement also said that the pilot will test the use case for programmable payroll with employees at Diia, a public IT solutions enterprise in Ukraine.

42375701,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwABJt,1639483200,Avalanche Adds USDC Stablecoin in Continued DeFi Push,"Avalanche, an Ethereum-rivaling smart contract blockchain, is adding a native version of USDC – the stablecoin backed by cash and liquid cash equivalents that is administered by Boston-based Circle.  Bringing USDC to Avalanche should further grease the wheels of decentralized finance (DeFi) on the network, following a recently announced $200 million incubation fund for DeFi projects of various stripes. Robust stablecoin options are seen as table stakes for any emerging base layer looking to rival Ethereum for functionality.  Up until now, users have had to bridge USDC from Ethereum over to Avalanche.  “This is kind of convoluted,” said Ava Labs President John Wu in an interview. “Going forward, this partnership allows native USDC to be minted and printed right on Avalanche, which will save users costs and the headache of buying and selling.”  Wu said the addition of native USDC to Avalanche will likely “turbocharge” the amount of DeFi already happening on the network. He pointed out that there is around $1.3 billion passing across the USDC bridge to Avalanche, which is more than the amount being bridged across tether (USDT), currently the highest-volume stablecoin in circulation.  “On Avalanche, the use of USDC is higher than that of USDT,” Wu said. “Although USDT’s market cap is bigger, USDC is probably the one that a lot of U.S.-based people trust more.”  USDC’s multi-chain push  Avalanche will be the seventh blockchain to incorporate Circle’s USDC, joining Hedera, Tron, Ethereum, Algorand, Stellar and Solana. Earlier this year, Circle announced plans to expand USDC to about 10 more networks.  Circle VP of Product Joao Reginatto said he was excited to see USDC integrate with Avalanche, which already has significant traction in DeFi and ranks in the top five chains in terms of total value locked (TVL).  Read more: AVAX’s Ava Labs Among Startups Chosen for Mastercard’s Crypto Accelerator  In terms of a bump in volume experienced by chains that add USDC, Reginatto said it typically takes a transition period to get everything working, as well as getting market makers on board and supply circulating.  “As we’ve observed in the past, there’s never an immediate impact,” Reginatto said in an interview. “There’s a meaningful lag since it’s a new asset and the ecosystem always needs to make adjustments, and typically it takes a number of months until things kick into gear.”",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | USDT | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/14/avalanche-adds-native-minting-of-usdc-stablecoin-in-continued-defi-push,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ca3030c869d31d9db29db837b53460be3e58f18-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dogecoin rose to as high as $0.20 following Musk’s tweet, before falling back to about $0.18.  Musk, who was yesterday named Time magazine’s person of the year, has previously lent support to dogecoin development and adoption even as the memecoin’s creators abandoned the project back in 2015.  Earlier this year, Tesla started accepting bitcoin as payment for its electric cars. The pilot proved short-lived amid rising concerns about Bitcoin’s energy usage and was soon dropped.  Musk has tweeted regularly about dogecoin. In February he posted a picture of a rocket next to the moon. He followed that post with a one-word tweet stating “Doge” – a play on the saying of “going to the moon,” a term for an asset-price surge. The same month he posted an edited picture from “The Lion King,” with himself as Rafiki and a Shiba Inu as Simba. Dogecoin prices jumped again.  A May tweet saw Musk state he was working with dogecoin developers to improve system efficiency. It sent dogecoin prices flying by 22%. Then in June, he tweeted it was “important to support” a proposal that sought to reduce dogecoin fees – one that would make dogecoin more competitive compared to other cryptocurrencies.  Still, Musk does not see the crypto sector succeeding as many crypto fanatics otherwise do.

Moving forth to the year 2021, this phenomenon is believed to have commenced in early November 2021, where massive selloffs of Bitcoin and Ethereum took place as a result of a collective of negative catalysts such as the US Infrastructure Bill, China&apos;s clampdown on Bitcoin mining and the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant, just to name a few. As popular as Bitcoin and Ethereum are, they are still considered as speculative assets by many experts since they are heavily exposed to high-volume trading and market manipulations on major exchanges. Unfortunately, the performance of many crypto sectors and projects closely follows the market patterns of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and thus are not performing well in this crypto winter. Surprisingly, in the midst of this winter, a rising crypto asset class, GameFi, particularly a token such as Jedstar, has been less affected by the effects of crypto winters. In this article, we will reveal how Jedstar intends to shield itself against the negative effects of crypto winters, as opposed to crypto behemoths, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance Coin, and other GameFi tokens, such as Axie Infinity and Decentraland.

The moves came as stocks fell in Asia amid a move to less risky assets.  Avalanche (AVAX) slid as much as 11% to a support level of $77 at press time, part of a broader downtrend from the high $130s, and an almost 50% reduction from the token’s highs.  Similar drops were seen in algorand (ALGO) and cosmos (ATOM), which fell to $1.32 and $21.37, respectively.  The declines follow months of gains for tokens of the base (layer 1) blockchains, colloquially billed as “Ethereum rivals.” Layer 1s are blockchains that may have a different consensus mechanism than Ethereum and are generally cheaper and faster for conducting transactions.  Tokens of such platforms have seen a huge rise in the past months. ATOM traded at $9 in June and peaked at $43 in September. ALGO surged from $0.74 to $2.38 in the same period, data from CoinGecko shows.  AVAX, which was changing hands at $11 in June, hit a peak of $134 in November. Development on the platform rose alongside the prices, with projects like reserve-backed currency platform Wonderland and interest-bearing collateral provider Abracadabra locking up billions of dollars worth of tokens.  Value locked by decentralized finance (DeFi) projects – protocols using smart contracts to create financial services like lending and trading for users – on Avalanche rose to a staggering $13 billion last week from as little as $3.6 million in February, data on tracking tool DeFi Llama shows.  Despite the strong fundamentals, some say investors are seeking less-risky investments as the broader market takes a tumble.  “The current macro de-risking attitude from traditional finance investors has also affected the broader crypto market, meaning that the most common names will see an obvious decrease in pricing,” James Wo, founder of crypto investment fund Digital Finance Group, said in a Telegram message.  A weak bitcoin price action preceded declines in the broader crypto market.

The native token of Ethereum’s blockchain fell by more than 8% on Monday, falling below an uptrend line connecting July and September lows.  Ether printed a UTC close under the widely tracked 100-day moving average with the long-held support level of $3,900 turning into resistance.  The breakdown is backed by a below-50 reading on the daily relative strength index chart, which could encourage more selling. The weekly histogram of trading indicator moving average convergence divergence (MACD) also fell below zero, indicating a bearish trend.  “Both the weekly stochastics and MACD are on sell signals, which calls for risk management,” Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a weekly research note published late Monday.  An extended sell-off, if any, could find support near $3,250 – the current level of the 200-day moving average.  According to Stockton, the broader outlook remains constructive with monthly MACD and long-term trend gauges still showing bullish signals. “It is important to note that ether confirmed a breakout to new all-time highs in November for a measured move projection near $6000, providing a long-term bullish framework,” she noted.

42375705,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwABL9,1639466749,Bitcoin CME Futures Slip Into ‘Backwardation’ as Bearish Sentiment Grips Market,"Bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have slipped into “backwardation,” a market condition that represents declining institutional appetite for the cryptocurrency.  Data tracked by Skew shows that backwardation – when future contract prices are lower than short-term prices – emerged on Monday with the one-month contract slipping to an annualized discount of nearly 14%, the steepest since at least mid-2020.  The three-month bitcoin futures slipped to a discount of 3%, as the cryptocurrency fell more than 6% to $45,700.  Institutional investors prefer to use regulated CME futures contracts to gain exposure to bitcoin. ProShares’ bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and Valkyrie Investments’ ETF launched in October also invest in CME-listed futures.  So, a discount in CME futures could represent weak demand from institutions and sophisticated investors, as investment banking giant JPMorgan noted in May. Back then, the futures slipped into discount, with bitcoin’s price crashing from $58,000 to $30,000.  The backwardation is perhaps the sign of bearish sentiment stemming from renewed coronavirus concerns and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s impending monetary policy tightening. Further, market participants could be reducing exposure ahead of year end.  Physically delivered contracts like oil or pork belly futures see backwardation when there is an incentive to own physical material at the earliest – say, to keep the production process going. That pushes the spot price higher than the futures price.  The CME bitcoin futures are cash-settled – there is no actual transfer of coins on the settlement date. Besides, bitcoin is still primarily seen as a speculative asset rather than a physical commodity like oil or pork bellies.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/14/bitcoin-cme-futures-slip-into-backwardation-as-bearish-sentiment-grips-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48b58cbdbdf0a73bb3e1a50615415999c5603831-2618x801.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The platform, which is built on the Polygon network, offers over six blockchain games, a decentralized exchange, as well as a non-fungible token marketplace.  “All My Forge wallets have been secured. Only a few needing PYR back,” the developers in a tweet. They said that a buyback and token burn – mechanisms that see projects purchase tokens on the open market and send tokens to a “burn” address respectively – will be conducted in the following days.  All refunds were made from Vulcan Forged’s treasury, a fund that crypto projects use to save money for crises. Refunds were made in PYR and LAVA tokens, starting late Monday night and continuing until Tuesday morning.  PYR tokens fell 34% to $21 on Monday following news of the hack. PYR recovered slightly to $24 during European hours on Monday and retreated to $21.15 at press time.  Hackers stole 4.5 million PYR – nearly 9% of the token’s total supply – worth $140 million at the time, alongside relatively smaller amounts of ether (ETH) and polygon (MATIC).  The hackers got hold of over 96 private keys belonging to some of the biggest Vulcan Forged users.

The search comes after former APAC chief Jeremy Ng left the company in recent weeks, according to two sources with direct knowledge.  Ng was with the exchange for less than two years and was appointed to lead Singapore operations just five months ago. As CoinDesk reported at the time, the exchange was pursuing an expansion across Asia.  Those aspirations seem to have run into regulatory bottlenecks: Gemini is still waiting for its digital payment token license to be approved by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), along with another 70 companies.  Read more: Gemini Exchange to Expand Asia-Pacific Operations in a Bid to Capture Growth  Competence in liaising with regulators across jurisdictions is a key component of the job, the latest LinkedIn post says.  Singapore enacted the Payment Services Act in January 2020, which allows crypto firms, including exchanges, to be licensed and operate in the city-state.  But only four licenses have been issued to date, while the list of companies that have been rejected or withdrawn their applications has piled up to 100.  A Gemini spokesperson declined to comment on the personnel change, adding that its commitment to Asia hasn’t changed.  “We trust that the regulator will move forward with our application, as well as other firms who meet their criteria, in due course,” the spokesperson said when asked about the DPT license.  The exchange’s Singapore office has grown moderately since July; back then, Gemini said it counted 30 staff. The new LinkedIn post says the APAC leader will oversee upwards of 40 employees in Singapore.  Falling in place  In recent weeks, crypto exchanges like Huobi and Binance seem to have been crystallizing their plans for the city-state, in part nudged by the regulator. Global companies are not allowed to offer services to Singaporeans but some exchanges are looking for local carve-outs.  Binance has decided to withdraw both its global and local business. MAS issued a warning to Binance.com in early September, and the world’s largest exchange moved to limit its offerings for Singaporean users just days later.  On Dec. 13, Binance’s Singapore crypto trading platform, operated by Binance Asia Services Ltd., announced it would drop its DPT license application and stop offering services in Singapore.  Read more: Binance Singapore Drops Crypto License Plans in City-State  Meanwhile, Huobi Global tapped Singapore for its regional headquarters on Nov. 30, weeks after it announced it would expel all its local users.  At the same time, Huobi has set up a local entity that has applied for the DPT license.  The company will launch its Singapore trading platform in private pilot mode once it is done with an update that will ensure compliance with new MAS anti-money laundering requirements, Edward Chen, CEO of Huobi Singapore, told CoinDesk.  The pilot is planned to start at the end of the year, the CEO said. Huobi’s platform will be fully launched once the company has secured its license from MAS, Chen said.  Huobi Singapore operates under FEU International, which is a subsidiary of Huobi Tech, a Hong Kong-listed company that is independent from Huobi Group.

42394331,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc83t,1639453442,The Future of Crypto: The Industry That Once Focused Solely on Bitcoin Is Rapidly Evolving,"When bitcoin was introduced by the Satoshi white paper in 2008, it presented a novel and liberating concept – a peer-to-peer, decentralized payment system that can be used by anyone, anywhere and for everything. It did not require intermediaries or an exchange rate to function, and created a single globally used currency for any type of transaction.  Then greed got in the way.  The use case that it was supposed to deliver has somewhat faded. Instead of focusing on its initial intent – a payment method – the focus shifted to bitcoin as an investment vehicle, a store value, a digital gold.  Merav Ozair, PhD is a leading Blockchain Expert and a FinTech professor at New Jersey’s Rutgers Business School.  Some of bitcoin’s first adapters were evangelists, motivated by the financial crisis of 2008, who genuinely wanted to make a difference in the world and create a new type of a global financial system. The majority, however, have been speculators who smelled an opportunity to make money. Bitcoin started trading on crypto exchanges, like a financial instrument, subject to high price volatility due to speculators trading activity. But it has moved further away from its economic use case – a payment method – and become more of a speculative financial vehicle.  For bitcoin to become globally adapted as a mode of payment it has to be scalable, or expandable, enough to support such activity. But blockchain technology that enables bitcoin is still struggling, and developers are in a constant quest to find systems for a decentralized blockchain that is both secure and scalable. As long as a scalable system is not found and bitcoin is not able to deliver on its initial use case, the speculators have the upper hand. When speculators dictate value, volatility increases, making it even more difficult for bitcoin to be adapted as a payment method.  Bitcoin’s high volatility has crippled its ability to serve as a mode of payment and has led to the proliferation of stablecoins. The argument is that business transactions cannot depend on a volatile payment. Businesses need certainty and stability. Bitcoin, at its current state, cannot deliver that stability and thus make room for the need for stablecoins.  Again, greed got in the way.  Many stablecoins have been launched but only a handful are in actual use. Stablecoins are mainly used either on crypto exchanges as a substitute for fiat currency or on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to attain attractive return or yield on investments, which are significantly higher than returns offered by traditional saving methods. Yet, like bitcoin they are not used for daily retail transactions as a mode of payment.  Meta’s (formerly Facebook) 2019 announcement of its intention to launch a stablecoin not only stirred up a conversation among regulators on the status of stablecoins, but also fueled a sense of urgency among nations to protect their sovereignty and to gear up their efforts in developing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Although all nations are investigating and debating the use of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and CBDCs, their approaches have been very different.  China is launching its own CBDC and making use of all other cryptocurrencies (including stablecoins) illegal, while Japan acknowledges bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal property and their use as a mode of payment. Other nations are unclear, but they are also calling for cryptocurrency and stablecoin regulations, such as the European Commission’s proposed regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) or the U.S. President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) report outlining the regulatory landscape for stablecoins.  Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller in a November speech acknowledged that “the U.S. payment system is experiencing a technology-driven revolution.” Skeptical of the need for a CBDC, he argued that “payments innovation, and the competition it brings, is good for consumers.” His comments were supportive of the continued efforts of technology companies to develop stablecoins’ payment solutions alongside financial institutions.  Interestingly, Waller recognized that “in a perfect world, there would be one payment system and one payment instrument that everyone uses. Obviously, he was not referring to Bitcoin or to any decentralized payment system, as he refuted such a scenario of a one-payment system, saying that “in our imperfect world, this would confer monopoly power over the payment system” – alluding to a centralized payment system or provider.  Recall that Bitcoin’s premise was to create a “perfect world,” where no entity confers monopoly power over the payment system. It was designed as a payment system that “runs by the people for the people.” But when the bitcoin cryptocurrency became a financial instrument, trading on crypto exchanges, people forgot where it all began.  There seems to be a consensus among regulators and policy makers as to the benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT) for financial systems and consumers globally. They do not agree, however, on the use and applicability of DLT. It is very likely that the use of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and CBDCs will coincide, and their applicability and prominence will differ across jurisdictions and regions.  Asia-Pacific will likely support cryptocurrencies. Mastercard launched crypto payments cards in Asia-Pacific with the aim of making crypto transactions seamless. Europe will likely prefer a CBDC. The U.K. and other countries in the eurozone are tirelessly working on CBDC solutions. The U.S. would probably choose stablecoins or an equivalent over a digital dollar.  DLT and blockchain technology will continue to evolve and become the “rails” of all financial and economic systems and applications. To facilitate the interaction for everyday users with these applications, we’ll probably witness a dichotomy of utility tokens and payment instruments, such as stablecoins or CBDCs.  More specifically, applications, like DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFT) will be launched on decentralized blockchains, using their native token (e.g., ETH, ALGO) to conduct transactions on their platforms, while users will interact seamlessly with these applications, as they currently do with their smartphone applications, using stablescoins, CBDCs or credit/debit cards – either crypto or fiat currency. These platforms will play an integral role in the metaverse universe evolution.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Merav Ozair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/14/the-future-of-crypto-the-industry-that-once-focused-solely-on-bitcoin-is-rapidly-evolving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb511e504a472a1ec24deb76ab22d3c628a39ccb-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Another Sold For 347ETH, But Wait…","The second most popular NFT collection, Bored Ape Yacht Club, is back on the news. On the one hand, a deadly mistake cost a pseudonymous user more than $250K. On the other, a feelgood story of a diamond-hand holder that minted a Bored Ape seven months ago and just sold it for over $1M. Or did he?

B3 is exploring opportunities in the asset tokenization, digital asset custody and crypto-as-a-service (CaaS) segments, InfoMoney reported.  The Sao Paulo-based stock exchange is also considering services to facilitate over-the-counter (OTC) trading and access to liquidity centers.  “It is natural for us to expand into the unregulated world of cryptocurrencies,” said Finkelsztain, who added that B3 is not planning to be a crypto exchange but provide services to crypto traders.  B3 expects to launch a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF), although it did not establish which index a potential ETF would replicate.  Brazilian companies have launched five crypto ETFs. Crypto asset manager Hashdex has launched three of these products, while fintech company QR Capital has released the other two.  In October, Brazil’s Central Bank said that B3 could serve as the blockchain leader for the smart contract system of a digital real, a central bank digital currency (CBDC).",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/14/brazil-stock-exchange-b3-plans-to-enter-crypto-market-in-2022-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d6e040d0f090504753628c388d60daea1d907915-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
