42398745,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgUb5,1445032656,Bitcoin in the Headlines: The Blockchain Reigns Supreme,"If you are tired of reading about blockchain technology, then look away now, as bitcoin's underlying ledger dominated much of the mainstream news flow again this week.  Elsewhere, Bitreserve's decision to rebrand as Uphold and ostensible move away from bitcoin also captivated the media's attention, and was subsequently followed by various pieces which questioned the digital currency's means of survival.  Who's said what and where? Here's CoinDesk's latest look at the top bitcoin and blockchain-related headlines from across the world.  Barclays banks on the blockchain  Writing for New York Business Journal, Michael del Castillo reported that UK bank Barclays had signed contracts with a group of companies that participated in its first-ever New York City FinTech accelerator, two of which were blockchain startups.  Del Castillo added:    ""The mood in the air isn’t surprising, considering that following the July accelerator in London, Barclays announced it was 'exploring opportunities' with seven companies, including one contract with Safello, a blockchain company.""              ""By comparison, today's large class of actual contract winners is especially notable due to what White [Derek White, Barclays' chief design and innovation officer] described as a steeper education curve around blockchain technology,"" he wrote. ""But he also said that while negotiating the blockchain contracts took time to execute, he believes the extra effort will pay off in the end.""      City A.M's Clara Guibourg wrote a piece titled ""Barclays is teaming up with blockchain startups Chainalysis and Wave as the bank's bitcoin experiment expands"".      In her article, Guibourg said that Barclays had signed contracts with two blockchain startups in what the bank is calling a ""game changer"".      Speaking about the difficulties facing companies in the space wanting to secure a banking partner, she added:      ""This is one of the first times a major bank has opened up for such cooperation with blockchain clients, as many bitcoin companies have had difficult access to banking services.""              Barclay's partnership with Wave and Chainalytics should come as no surprise given the recent fascination with distributed ledgers among the world's banks.      More bitcoin vs blockchain    A PYMNTS article weighed in to the ongoing bitcoin vs. blockchain debate, asserting how the digital currency had struggled to gain legitimacy in the global market.  The article said:    ""Its underlying technology, the blockchain, has had far more success, largely thanks to major institutions that have made major investments in the technology.""    The last few weeks, the piece continued, have seen an increasing amount of attention being placed on blockchain technology.    ""In other words, the blockchain just might have the opportunity to take off and change the way global, corporate payments are done, whether its sibling, bitcoin, comes along for the ride or not,"" it added.      Computer Weekly also highlighted the ensuing battle between bitcoin and blockchain technology in a piece titled ""Why blockchain heralds a rethink of the entire banking industry"".      In the article, the publication's editor-in-chief, said:      ""Interest has grown quickly, and comes partly as a result of blockchain shedding its association with the volatile bitcoin currency.""    Lawrence Wintermeyer, the CEO of Innovate Finance cited in the piece, seems to think so, saying:    “Forget about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies ...The number one trending topic for the past three months has been blockchain.”    Bitreserve's 'pivot'  Bitreserve's rebranding sparked numerous reports this week, some of which focused on what was said to be the company's shift away from bitcoin toward a future more geared toward traditional finance.  As the write-up by TechCrunch (entitled ""Rebranding As Uphold, Bitreserve Says Goodbye To Bitcoin) said of the announcement: ""The company formerly known as Bitreserve is moving beyond its bitcoin roots to become a full-service provider of financial transactions under the new moniker Uphold.""      Yet the publication's report drew criticism from Uphold's VP of product, Byrne Reese, who contested ""the assertion that we are 'saying goodbye to bitcoin'"" in a statement posted to the comments section of the article.  He continued:    ""I find the underlying logic behind this narative [sic], in fact, to be flawed. The idea that when a company like Uphold, Circle, or ChangeTip provides their customers with an interface to the banking world, that we are somehow turning our backs on bitcoin is honestly kind of absurd.""    Uphold is moving further in the direction of supporting cryptocurrencies through the future listing of voxels, a digital currency which will be tied to the Voxelus virtual reality content platform.

42398746,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgUc4,1445014838,Winklevoss Exchange Gemini Struggling to Win Bitcoin Traders,"Gemini, the long-awaited New York-based bitcoin exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and billed as the ""Nasdaq of bitcoin"", finally debuted on 8th October.  Featured in articles by The Financial Times, TechCrunch and Wired, and promoted via a TV appearance on Fox News, Gemini it succeeded in grabbing the attention of the mainstream media like few industry products before it.  While a success in terms of promotion, however, Gemini is showing signs it is struggling to appeal to bitcoin's active trading community. Though representatives of the exchange stated they're seeking to attract a more institutional clientele than their competitors, avid bitcoin traders tell CoinDesk that they believe this strategy will be difficult to execute.  They argue that Gemini's pricing model, charging both buyers and sellers on each trade, while potentially attractive to infrequent institutional traders, could prove an issue that will drive away retail traders, a demographic they argue is essential for building liquidity.  Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin derivatives platform BitMEX, told CoinDesk:  ""Gemini's ability to convert retail traders to their platform will determine their short-term success. Gemini definitely has the star power of the Winklevoss twins, but I don't know how far that will take them in the grudge match that is to come.""  The top bitcoin exchanges around the globe currently post more liquidity than Gemini, effectively meaning traders on those exchanges are able to cash in and out of the market more quickly, a must, more active market participants argue, for profit-making.  According to CoinMarketCap, Bitstamp's 24-hour volume is 20,209 BTC ($5.3m), 50 times that of Gemini's daily total, while competitors Bitfinex and BTC-e saw 12,742 BTC ($3.3m) and 8,340 BTC ($2.1m) in trading volume over the last 24 hours.  Gemini is currently struggling to attract volume, though at press time it had traded 384 BTC (roughly $100,000) on 14th October, a figure that was nearly double total daily trade volumes throughout its first week.  Overall, representatives from institutional trading firms such as Crypto Currency Fund and Binary Financial said they were reviewing the exchange's performance to determine if and when they would enter the market, while others stated they were waiting for its liquidity to increase.  Of note is that some members of the bitcoin exchange ecosystem expressed overall disappointment in the strength of the Gemini offering, but were unwilling to speak publicly due to perceptions it could be viewed as negative or detrimental to the ecosystem.  Charging the makers  One of the more frequent subjects of criticism was the exchange's plan to charge 25 basis points to the buyer and seller on each side of trades.  The founder of one major cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform, wishing to remain unnamed, called the decision ""strange"" due to the fact that bitcoin exchanges have been striving to make their pricing more appealing to liquidity providers in an effort to gain greater market share.  This maker-taker model, in which those who ""take"" liquidity are charged more, is employed by exchange such Coinbase, Coinfloor, Kraken and itBit. Business-to-business exchange Coinsetter even offers a 0.1% trading rebate, meaning liquidity providers are paid part of the exchange's earnings for their support.  Tim Enneking, manager of bitcoin hedge fund Crypto Currency Fund, agreed that the pricing went against the trend of fees declining across the industry. Active traders, he argued, ""couldn't survive"" on Gemini's current pricing model, noting that these individuals, while adding valuable liquidity to exchanges, rely on small price swings for profit.  Enneking said:  ""They're going to have to make their offering attractive to smaller players, and I'm not sure that they've succeeded in doing that yet.""  Features such as enhanced security, he said, were unlikely to appeal to these traders, who are already used to trading with a certain amount of risk, though he said he believes this is a ""great argument"" for institutions.  Rob Borden, CEO of bitcoin trading tool platform Coinigy, echoed the sentiment that the fees were comparable to those on other exchanges, with the exception of fees for market makers.  ""Coinbase, for example, offers solely a taker fee, and yet other exchanges offer free trading, with a fee for withdrawals only,"" Borden explained. ""So far, the reception has been fairly positive from what I've seen, but concerns over early liquidity and the verification process linger.""  Boosting liquidity  Elsewhere, other market observers sided with Borden in questioning the low levels of liquidity on the exchange, a factor they conceded was partly due to expectations created by the marketing effort around the launch.  George Samman, co-founder of bitcoin derivatives marketplace BTC.sx (now Magnr) and head of marketing at Fuzo, called Gemini's volume ""anemic"", a description he attributed to its ""late"" arrival in the US market when compared to regulated competitors Coinbase and itBit, which have been active in the US since January and May, respectively.  Coinbase has averaged 9,800 BTC (roughly $2.5m) in trades on its platform over the last five days, according to Cryptowatch, while itBit's 24-hour volume at press time was 7,924 BTC (roughly $2m).  In contrast, Gemini has seen an increase in volume since its launch last week, reaching a high of 240 BTC on 15th October, according to data from Cryptowatch. The exchange traded at a low of 14.48 BTC on 10th October, a figure that then steadily increased to 62.78 BTC, 115.4 BTC and 211.5 BTC over the next three days.  Still, Samman acknowledged Gemini's liquidity problem is one that faces the entire industry, due to weakening demand for bitcoin as an asset and what he called a ""distrust"" in existing exchange options. Further, he suggested that Gemini's by-the-book approach to launching in New York may have turned off avid traders, including those with libertarian or anti-government leanings.  ""Regulation is having a big effect on volume as services have been stopped in certain areas and traders are leaving sites they deem to be overly regulated,"" he said, echoing Borden.  A less common criticism from the community was the perceived gap between bids and ask prices on the exchange, or the gap in prices at which traders were setting buy and sell prices.  Sources said this is likely to be the result of smaller traders needing to cover costs as a result of the pricing model on Gemini. For example, the derivative exchange founder, indicated charging liquidity providers less and buyers more would have ""looked better"" as they would offer tighter spreads.  ""You could say people might prefer to trade on Coinbase because the spread is going to be tight,"" he said. ""Gemini is never going to be tight.""  Building influence  Still, there was broad enthusiasm for the offering, with most respondents praising the exchange's launch as a positive for the ecosystem and noting that building the trust and patronage of the bitcoin trading community is simply something that takes time.  Most comparisons were drawn to itBit, which launched in the US in May. Since then, the exchange has been slowly building volume on the back of an effective market strategy that saw it gain an early advantage as the first bitcoin exchange to receive a banking charter.  As a result, the future of Gemini was framed in terms of regulated US exchanges like itBit, which serves all 50 states, as well as rival Coinbase, open in 36 states at press time.  ""What it boils down to is how they will differentiate themselves from Coinbase and itBit,"" Hayes said.  ""All three of these US based exchanges' value proposition is a regulated exchange for Americans. Apart from that, they all offer the same features.""  Some respondents said the lackluster volume on Gemini has been, in part, a perception problem caused by the strong marketing effort around the exchange launch. Following the news of the launch, the price of bitcoin hit its highest levels since August, spurred in part by perception Gemini could bring new liquidity to the ecosystem.  ""A lot of people were looking for Gemini to deliver something fantastic and new, what they were expecting were for people to go buy bitcoins because they watch Fox News,"" one source said.  Enneking went on to agree that Gemini would likely need to pivot its strategy to win the already active bitcoin trading community should it want to hold its own in a competitive field, and thus appeal to institutions, concluding:  ""The differences in functionality, for very specific purposes may be beneficial, but for the general community, unless someone offers something revolutionary and new, that's not going to be the factor that drives real legitimate volume.""

42398749,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgUg0,1444996146,Bitcoin Price Breaks $260 to Hit Two Month High,"UPDATE (16th October 13:48 BST): Comment added from BTCC CEO Bobby Lee.      Bitcoin broke the $260 mark this morning, hitting its highest price in two months.  The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which has been rallying since mid-September, saw a 2.5% increase over the last 24 hours.  By 9:53am (UTC), the digital currency had reached $260 – the first time since 16th August. It has since been dipping back into the $259 range.  This week has seen a sudden surge in bitcoin trading volume, driven predominantly by the Chinese exchanges Huobi and OKCoin.  On Wednesday, 1.29m BTC was traded in total – the highest amount since 26th January. OKCoin accounted for 48% of this volume.  Bobby Lee, CEO of Chinese exchange BTCC, told CoinDesk his platform has seen a significant volume increase, though he dismissed much of his competitors' volume as ""artificial"".  Those behind the volume, he said, are not traders but consumers sucked into a Russian ponzi scheme, MMM.  ""We have posted warnings on our site and on our social media to warn users to be careful, but they have been coming to our exchange and buying out like crazy,"" he said, adding:  ""This time it's not speculative trading but based on them getting sucked into this ecosystem.""  Arthur Hayes, co-founder of bitcoin derivatives exchange BitMEX, had a different theory. He told CoinDesk that rumours of China further devaluing the yuan are fuelling interest in bitcoin, and the current rally:  ""Individuals who see the writing on the wall are beginning to use bitcoin as a means of wealth preservation. As a result, the premium for bitcoin in China is rising, and the effective means to arbitrage the difference onshore and offshore has closed. This is fuelling the rally we are seeing. Just today the premium touched a new local high of 3%.""",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/16/bitcoin-price-breaks-260-to-hit-two-month-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09f6a1ae188a1197410dc3860ca73cf7c9fe6c79-1500x833.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398741,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgUWA,1444990377,Scottish MP Urges Party to Consider Digital Currency,"A member of parliament for the Scottish National Party (SNP) has urged his party to consider experimenting with a national digital currency.  Speaking at the SNP conference held in Aberdeen – in northeastern Scotland – George Kerevan said he wanted the country to trial the ScotPound, a native digital currency that would co-exist alongside the pound sterling.  The digital currency, Kerevan told BuzzFeed News, would be an important ready-made alternative to the pound when the next independence debate surfaced, and one that could ""bubble up"" through the party.  Kerevan's comments follow the publication of a report last month by The New Economics Foundation which first suggested the 'ScotPound'.      As previously reported  by CoinDesk, the report proposed that each Scottish citizen should be given a 250 ScotPound dividend and that payments should be made via text message or a mobile app.                  Scotland's fight for independence, primarily led by the SNP, resulted in a national referendum in September last year, which saw the majority of participants (55.3%) vote against independence.
