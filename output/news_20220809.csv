Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin and Other Cryptos Return to Red  By James Rubin  Bitcoin's four-day surge was nice while it lasted.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just above $23,200, down more than 2% over the past 24 hours and far removed from its temporary perch nearly $1,000 higher earlier Monday. Investors are apparently hunkered down waiting for the Wednesday morning release of July's Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the U.S.  Analysts widely expect the CPI to drop to a still hefty 8.7% after hitting a four-decade high of 9.1% in June, suggesting that while inflation is slowing it remains problematic enough for the U.S. Federal Reserve to likely approve a third consecutive 75 basis point interest rate hike.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap behind bitcoin, was recently changing hands at about $1,700, down approximately 4% from the previous day and well off a euphoric, two-month high about $1,800 early Monday. Other major cryptos were well-red on Tuesday with FILE and KSM recently tumbling more than 11% and 9%, respectively.  ""You've seen quite a bit of stability in some of the price action, a bit of a rally off some of the recent lows,"" Don Kaufman, co-founder of TheoTrade, told CoinDesk TV's ""All About Bitcoin"" show.  But Kaufman also highlighted a decline in implied volatility, a bad sign for near-term pricing.  ""Although there's been a little bit of decoupling between Nasdaq and the crypto marketplace, the interesting irony of that happens to be that that's going to come raging back, and the very catalysts to spark that? Possibly tomorrow morning's CPI.""  Crypto prices Tuesday tracked equity markets, which also fell, although more moderately than most tokens. The tech-focused Nasdaq was off more than a percentage point and the S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, was down a few fractions of a point. Investors returned at least temporarily to the risk-averse strategies they have followed for much of the past year. Gold, a traditional safe haven asset, ticked slightly higher and has risen more than 3% over the past month.  Market anxiety  Markets have suffered jitters this week amid disappointing earnings from a number of tech giants, including chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron Technology (MU). An unexpectedly high CPI could send markets further downward, suggesting the U.S. economy will continue to battle turbulence.  Later in the day, Coinbase said trading activity for its second quarter had plunged almost 30% from its first quarter and that revenue had missed the average analyst estimate. ""It was a rough quarter for most companies in the crypto space,"" Coinbase President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi told Bloomberg TV. We had some big episodic events in the quarter so some of those asset prices shrunk, which impacts the assets on platform and other numbers.""  The crypto exchange has been buffeted by the same headwinds afflicting the rest of the digital asset industry, prompting the firm to lay off about 20% of its workforce as part of cost-cutting initiatives. More recently, a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware by shareholder Donald Kocher on behalf of Coinbase Global Inc. alleges the company’s leadership made “false and misleading statements” in the firm’s public filings ahead of its direct listing in April 2021.  Other crypto news was more upbeat with crypto intelligence firm Messari announcing plans for $25 million funding round at a $300 million valuation and analytics platform Merkle Science and Maker DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that provides capital and operational support to ""creators,"" closing $19 million and $20 million capital rounds, respectively. And South Korean blockchain protocol Klaytn announced that it had committed $20 million over four years to support blockchain development and funding at two of the country's universities.  Still, TheoTrade's Kaufman said pessimistically that bitcoin could fall into the teens, highlighting the ""huge cost of carry"" built into the asset. Kaufman said that rising interest rates affect miners and others in the crypto marketplace who use loans and other debt instruments ""to carry their crypto.""  ""A 75 basis point hike is unfathomably large to a crypto mining facility,"" he said. ""They're going to be paying like double digits.""  Kaufman added: ""It's difficult at this point to be wildly bullish in terms of day-to-day price action in bitcoin, until we get the Fed turning the table to maybe some dovish comments, and we can [be] quite a distance away from that.""

Not at South Korea's Mega Blockchain Week  By Sam Reynolds  The speeches and panels at Korea Blockchain Week ended Tuesday afternoon. The mega event has been a welcome return to personal interaction but proven to be short on drama even as crypto in South Korea reaches an inflection point.  Retail investor’s appetite for tokens continues to be strong, even as the market anxiously waits to see what comes of the warpath Korean prosecutors appear to be on.  Korea Blockchain Week has operated in a parallel world. There wasn’t a discussion about lessons learned and rebuilding post-Terra. It’s as if nothing bad ever happened in crypto.  Perhaps the muted atmosphere is a product of how the panels were structured. Most interviewers have been venture capitalists or, in the case of Binance founder’s Changpeng Zhao’s session, the company’s head of Asia. The people asking the questions have vested interests in seeing the industry succeed. They have been reluctant to challenge the interviewees. There was no pushback or the type of fireworks that leads to new thinking and innovation.  Korea Blockchain Week's approach did an incredible disservice to those in attendance, giving them an inaccurate impression of the state of the industry.  Consider: A panel titled “The Next Generation of Finance on Blockchain,” featuring Dylan Macalinao, failed to mention the Macalinao brothers’ hijinks – faking most of a decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem – and what it meant for the future of Solana or other layer 1 blockchains with anonymous developers. In the narrative of the conference, this $7.5 billion Solana scheme never happened. Macalinao, who was scheduled to present in person, didn’t even show up, instead joining virtually on a crackly internet connection from an undisclosed location.  The questions and answers were all bromides and platitudes anyway. The discussion centered on regulatory clarity, building better user interfaces for DeFi and how to bring in more retail participants – hardly hard-hitting topics from Doo Wan Nam, the chief operating officer of venture fund Stable Node.  Zhao’s session was more of the same. During his allotted 30 minutes, he told moderator Leon Foong, head of APAC at Binance, about how great Binance’s know-your-customer (KYC) system is and how the company is collecting licenses worldwide. Not exactly gripping material, especially when Binance finds itself in a debate over ownership of an India-based exchange that’s target of a money laundering investigation launched by local authorities.  Echo chambers have hurt the crypto industry before. Think about how Three Arrows Capital went from one of the industry’s most celebrated stakeholders to the possible downfall of many crypto infrastructure players seemingly overnight.  Sometimes uncomfortable questions need to be asked. The best conferences can’t be all celebratory.  Important events  ETHToronto  Korea Blockchain Week  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Crypto Privacy Debate Grows After US Bans Tornado Cash, MyEtherWallet Exec on Ethereum Merge  ""First Mover"" unpacked the top developing stories in crypto, including fallout from the U.S. ban of mixer Tornado Cash, and the push to keep the existing proof-of-work Ethereum blockchain after Ethereum moves to proof-of-stake. Guests included William Callahan, Blockchain Intelligence Group director and former DEA agent, along with MyEtherWallet COO Brian Norton.

With its continued growth, a lot of people have come forward to proffer their predictions for the price of the cryptocurrency both in the long and the short term. One of those is billionaire Mike Novogratz. However, despite being usually bullish on the price of bitcoin, Novogratz does not seem to expect much in the short term. Bitcoin Unlikely To Reach $30,000 Currently, the price of bitcoin is bouncing between the $23,000 and $24,000 level. This has seen a lot of speculation as regards what will happen when the digital asset is able to break out of this rut finally. For many, the recent recovery has led them to believe that there will definitely be a run-up back to $30,000, where the price had fallen from.

42394974,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWhFX,1660083206,Bitcoin Miner Riot Blockchain Delays Earnings Report to Sort Out How Much Crypto Rout Devalued Its Assets,"Bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain (RIOT) delayed its quarterly earnings report because it needs more time to calculate how much the cryptocurrency rout, the war in Ukraine and other macroeconomic issues have cut the value of its assets.  The delay was disclosed in a Tuesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, less than a week after the company said it planned to release the figures on Aug. 9. Riot's rivals Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Cipher Mining (CIFR) and CleanSpark (CLSK) all reported their earnings this week as anticipated.  Riot became one of the industry's biggest miners when it bought a gigantic facility in Rockdale, Texas, in May 2021. Bitcoin (BTC) miners have seen their margins slashed as the price of the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market value has dropped while energy prices, a major part of miners' costs, have soared globally due to the war in Ukraine.  Last week, Riot said it mined 28% fewer bitcoin in July than usual. Riot curtailed its energy consumption, earning $9.5 million in power credits, as heatwaves swept through Texas, increasing the state's demand for power. During the same month, 12,146 of Riot's mining rigs were offline as they were transferred from New York to Texas.  Riot's stock fell about 2% following the disclosure of the delay.

42421118,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUTd,1660082322,What the Tornado Cash Sanction Means for Privacy Coins,"There’s a long history of things that have only come into prominence after someone tried to hide them from view. In fact, there’s a name for the phenomenon – the Streisand Effect, named for the actress who attempted to remove images of her multimillion-dollar beachfront property from a small travel blog but only thrust them in front of the public.  Privacy educator Seth For Privacy says there’s hope that the U.S. government's latest attempt to limit financial secrecy will have a similar effect. Yesterday, the Treasury Department took the unprecedented step of sanctioning a crypto transaction anonymizer called Tornado Cash.  ""Why does the government want to prevent people from using a privacy tool in Ethereum?"" Seth, who also hosts the libertarian-leaning ""Opt Out"" podcast, said in an interview. For him, it’s not just a rhetorical question.  It might also shake people awake and remind them of the need for privacy tools in crypto. While many crypto proponents are broadly in support of privacy, public blockchains are built to be transparent. There are tools and methods to achieve transactional secrecy, but they are hardly guaranteed to work.  ""They're banning Tornado Cash, so what other options do I have within the Ethereum ecosystem outside of it?"" Seth said. Tornado, although not the only privacy app on Ethereum, was foundational for the network and likely the most-used mixer (although that point, notably, is hard to verify).  “The U.S. government would not sanction this tool if it didn't work,” he said.  Seth, a Monero contributor, is an advocate for privacy coins that run on blockchains with built-in systems to help obscure the flow of money. This is different from other public blockchains – for example, Bitcoin and Ethereum, which make transactions visible by default.  Part of his argument is that individual tools – bitcoin mixers like Blender and now Tornado Cash – are easy targets for governments and hackers. But blockchains are harder to take down. (That said, privacy-preserving blockchains have also come under intense scrutiny from regulators worldwide. We’ve seen a slew of privacy coin delistings in South Korea, Australia, Japan and the U.K.)  For years, privacy coins have seen limited mainstream adoption. Few exchanges support Monero or Zcash, the two largest private blockchains, even though they’re important parts of gray-area and illicit internet markets. It can also be difficult finding developers willing to work on these networks, considering the risks.  See also: A Step-by-Step Guide to Going Private | Privacy Week  And so, perhaps it’s not surprising that the Streisand Effect has been muted. Monero’s XMR token actually fell in trading yesterday. But Seth sees these networks as operating on longer-term trends. Financial privacy is essential to a lot of crypto’s aims, and a human right, Seth said.  ""In many ways, it [the Tornado sanction] is a continuation of what we've already been seeing,"" Seth said.  CoinDesk spoke with Seth to discuss the potential fallout from the Tornado sanction, the need for base-layer private blockchains and how to maintain your autonomy in an increasingly surveilled world. The conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.  What are your thoughts on this news?  In many ways, it's a continuation of what we've already been seeing. We've seen sanctions and legal cases brought against the operators of those centralized mixers. But I think the big difference here is that they're not only sanctioning the entity behind Tornado Cash, but specifically the contract addresses of the Tornado Cash smart contracts. This is a really big deal in that anyone who uses Ethereum and interacts with these smart contracts, it'll be completely visible on-chain that they're breaking sanctions law.  It is a continuation of the pressure of the US government and really everybody who falls in line with their sanctions list against privacy preserving tools, ostensibly for the prevention of money laundering and a threat of North Korea. But I would love for them to provide some evidence of what percentages they're seeing of this being used for money laundering. A lot of times they just issue the sanctions. They provide no background and move on.  Why should people invest in privacy coins?  Some people see the financial need and the market need for privacy. They see an awakening populace where people start to realize the need for personal privacy. And they want to get it on the ground floor and use that as an investment vehicle. There will be a lot of money to be made behind legitimate and useful privacy-preserving services and cryptocurrencies.  Other people come at it from the perspective of “I need a currency that can protect my financial privacy that can allow me to transact with or without government approval or oversight” – something that essentially will allow them to be their own person.  I know a lot of people reading this will likely come at it from the perspective of a Western mindset of, “Hey, I'm in America, I don't really have any worry about it. I don't care that the IRS monitors my bank transactions.” But people who have either been in authoritarian regimes or have been in countries that have quickly slid that way, they've realized that you need access to something that allows you to continue to transact if the government changes and wants to crack down on something.  If access to financial privacy is stripped away, all other human rights really evaporate quickly.  Why should people use privacy coins?  I want to be able to choose what level of information to reveal about how I handle my finances. We've gotten used to this current paradigm where we have no control over that.  Generally, credit card companies or banks see everything we do financially and often sell that data to other companies to build profiles on us to sell that to other companies. Our data is just completely out of our hands. Privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, specifically Monero, give you control over who knows what about how you're spending your money.  Everyone, even if they don't realize it, needs the ability to control who knows what about their spending, but you also have more hardcore cases. A battered woman may need to be able to escape an abusive husband or boyfriend.  Then there are the cases where there are governments that are stripping away human rights, stripping away the freedom of their own populace. Tools like privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies can be a valuable tool to fight back against that and fight for human rights and human freedom.  Considering increasing sanctions on crypto, what are the long-term risks to investing in privacy coins?  The risks have always been there. Sanctions are normally not [a risk] to worry about from a cryptocurrency investment perspective. I don't see OFAC [Office of Foreign Assets Control] sanctioning something like Monero because sanctioning a decentralized protocol is a very different thing than sectioning one specific smart contract on Ethereum. So I think that's less of a risk for investors.  What we've seen with cryptocurrencies is that governments will use back channels through regulatory bodies and banks to try to pressure exchanges to delist cryptocurrencies, because they know that the vast majority of people who come into cryptocurrencies and the vast majority of the liquidity for cryptocurrencies happens on centralized exchanges – Coinbase, Kraken, those kinds of exchanges. So I think that is probably the larger risk.  So the actions from the government will push people to think more about privacy coins and maybe become more interested?  I definitely think so. I mean, I think you can have a situation like the Streisand Effect where something becomes popular because it is banned. We could see more people than would otherwise ask, “Why does the government want to ban this? Why do they want to prevent people from using a privacy tool in Ethereum? They're banning Tornado Cash – what other options do I have within the Ethereum ecosystem outside of it?”  It will really shake many people up to the fact that these tools are here. And we'll get them thinking, exploring, researching and learning how these tools can help them. Lots of people who haven't thought about privacy on-chain within cryptocurrencies will be woken up by something like this. It's such a massive change in the policy of OFAC and such a big sweeping sanction that we haven't really seen before.  Is it possible for the government to sanction an entire blockchain?  It certainly is. They're not going to be able to shut down Bitcoin or prevent people from transacting peer-to-peer. The basics of Bitcoin would persist even despite an OFAC sanction of Bitcoin as an entire cryptocurrency.  See also: As Government Takes on the Tornado Mixer, It May Reap a Whirlwind | Opinion  The issue is that bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies do not have strong on-chain privacy. And because of that, anyone who's trying to use it in spite of a sanction would struggle. You would be at risk of being very easily detected in a system like Bitcoin or Ethereum.  More broadly, why do people need privacy?  It really boils down to privacy as a fundamental human right. We've never really had to battle this hard for personal privacy before the internet, before digital currencies. People just had privacy. You didn't have anyone spying on you, because there wasn't the technological capacity to do so. With all of the great things that the age of technology has brought to us, it's also brought this ability for malicious entities to benefit from surveillance and data collection.  The core of who we are as humans and what makes us unique and individual really comes from the ability to have personal privacy.  The other big reason is really just to bring control of that data back into our hands so that we can decide who has influence over us. Once we realize the need for personal privacy, we can leverage to start to take back control of that data and regain some personal autonomy.  So after this sanction, what do you think the future of the privacy coins will look like?  It's not something that dissuades me or most of the people that I talk to from working on privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, from buying privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies or from using them. It highlights the usefulness. The U.S. government would not sanction this tool if it didn't work.  Again, I'm not advocating for anything malicious or bad being done using those tools, but it's a sign that they can work and that governments are struggling to actually deal with them technologically. Because, ultimately, sanctions are not a technological tool. They're a legal tool that they can try to use to pressure their populace into not using a specific set of technological tools. Outside of that, I think that it's a bright future because of all of the advances that we're seeing in the privacy-preserving cryptocurrency space.  I'm hopeful that the continued push like this will actually even be more of a pressure on people within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to understand the need for privacy, and start to build this in as the default and as many applications and cryptocurrencies as possible. Ultimately, we need access to these things for humanity's sake for the human right of personal privacy, and for our own autonomy.",NEUTRAL,XMR,ASIA | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | XMR,Xinyi Luo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/08/09/what-the-tornado-cash-sanction-means-for-privacy-coins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42654d2f8a3879ddc5a3eaec936df7e69ffcf8f2-1821x1366.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CleanSpark got its start in 2014 providing energy products to homes and businesses. It entered bitcoin mining in 2020, according to the company website. Today, more than 90% of revenue comes from bitcoin mining, CEO Zach Bradford said during Tuesday's earnings conference call.  The firm reported a $29.3 million net loss for the third quarter of its fiscal year, in part driven by the reclassification of the energy business to be discontinued, which resulted in a $10.6 million impairment charge.  The miner’s adjusted EBITDA was $15.2 million for the quarter, down from $22.5 million in the previous quarter.  Revenue of $31 million missed analyst estimates for $34.5 million, according to FactSet data. Adjusted EBITDA of $15.2 million was down from $22.5 million the previous quarter.  The company upped hashrate guidance for year-end 2022 to 5 exahash/second (EH/s), and issued guidance for the end of 2023, when it expects to reach 22.4 EH/s.

The price of gold rose by 0.31% while crude oil declined 0.14%.  Macroeconomic news was light while market participants anxiously await the results of Wednesday’s release of inflation data in the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The report is expected to reveal how well the Federal Reserve’s anti-inflation measures have been working. The consensus of expectations is for an 8.7% year-over-year increase in the CPI.  Expectations for “core” inflation (which excludes energy and food costs) are that prices rose 6.1% year over year.  Alternative currencies (altcoins) tumbled, with EOS and XLM dropping 7% and 9%, respectively.  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $23,100 −3.5%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,692 −5.3%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,122.47 −0.4%      ●Gold: $1,811 per troy ounce +1.3%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.80% +0.03       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Markets Pausing Ahead of CPI Report, Bitcoin Declines  Markets on Tuesday were focusing on release of the July CPI, which will show whether ongoing efforts to reduce inflation are working. The broad sell-off of stocks and crypto across traditional and digital markets suggests traders were looking to reduce risk ahead of the report, which will be released at 12:30 p.m. UTC (8:30 a.m. ET).  Should the CPI rise above the consensus expectation for an 8.7% increase, assets on traditional and digital markets will likely fall in price on expectations of another interest rate increase after September’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.  The CME FedWatch tool, which measures the probability and likely extent of future rate hikes, now shows a 70% probability of another 75 basis point rate increase, which would match the last rate hike announced in June.  Should the inflation rate fall below forecasts, the prospects for a 75 basis point increase will likely decline and crypto markets will respond positively.  The interest rate for the two-year U.S. Treasury note continues to exceed that of the 10-year Treasury, which historically has been an indication of economic distress.  The spread between the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes contextualizes how investors are pricing lending risk. Currently the spread implies that traders require greater compensation to lend money for two years than they do to lend money for 10 years, which indicates a lack of confidence in short-term economic conditions.  BTC is testing its trendline  From a technical perspective, BTC fell below its trendline on Tuesday. It will be important for traders to see if it reclaims the trendline. Volume in Tuesday trading fell below its 20-day moving average, a signal that there is limited conviction in the move lower.  Should bitcoin fail to reclaim the trend, it appears to be positioned to trade in a range rather than taking a significant downturn. The Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) tool shows spikes in activity at both the $23,000 and $20,000 levels.  The VPVR tool measures levels of activity at specific price levels. The data can show investors where price agreement occurs, indicating support and/or resistance.  The area of highest volume is labeled the “point of control” and is illustrated below (red line). The point of control can also indicate price levels where larger investors placed trades, as they tend to account for greater volume. The point of control is a barometer for where investors wish to get long or short an asset.

42395023,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWjxm,1660077166,Coinbase Shares Drop as Crypto Winter Takes Toll on Exchange's Trading Volume,"Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) fell about 5% after the cryptocurrency exchange said trading volume dropped substantially during the second quarter.  Customer trading activity amounted to $217 billion during the period, down from $309 billion in the first quarter of this year, according to a shareholder letter released Tuesday. Coinbase's overall revenue came in at $803 million, missing the average analyst estimate of $873.8 million, according to data compiled by FactSet.  Coinbase's stock has plunged since its IPO last year as the crypto and equity market rout prompted a slowdown in retail trading, forcing the company to slash jobs and focus on controlling costs. Even amid the current crypto winter, though, Coinbase continues to press ahead toward its goal of being a one-stop shop for crypto trading. Last week, it announced a partnership that lets customers of BlackRock – the world's largest asset manager, with $10 trillion – trade crypto through Coinbase.  ""While we do not take a decline in trading volume market share lightly, the shift in Q2 trading volume to high volume retail traders, market makers, and high-frequency trading firms did not translate into a corresponding revenue impact for Coinbase, as these customers trade high volumes but generate low fees,"" the company said.  Wall Street analysts weren’t expecting fireworks in the last quarter from Coinbase, though cryptocurrency prices have stabilized recently, which may lead some to ponder whether the second quarter marked the low point for the crypto exchange.  ""Q2 was a test of durability for crypto companies and a complex quarter overall. Dramatic market movements shifted user behavior and trading volume, which impacted transaction revenue, but also highlighted the strength of our risk management program,"" Coinbase said.  The exchange posted a net loss of $1.1 billion during the second quarter, versus the $430 million loss in the first quarter. In addition, Q2 adjusted Ebitda was a loss of $151 million compared with a gain of $20 million in Q1.  Coinbase said results were ""heavily impacted by non-cash impairment charges"" stemming from crypto and venture investments.  On the SEC securities inquiry, Coinbase said it's unsure whether or not it will turn into a formal investigation. ""[We are] committed to productive discussion with the SEC about crypto assets and securities regulation, and to working alongside all policymakers to build a workable regulatory framework for the crypto-economy that addresses any areas of risk, while enabling the development and adoption of digital innovation for the benefit of the broader society.""

Blockchain data shows a crypto address identified by crypto intelligence firms Nansen and Arkham Intelligence as Mashinsky’s made its first transactions since late May.  The wallet sold CEL tokens in multiple transactions Saturday and Tuesday, swapping 17,475 CEL for $28,242 worth of ether (ETH) on the decentralized exchange UniSwap, according to blockchain data tracer Etherscan.  The transfers were first spotted by a Twitter user who goes by the name alto.  Celsius and Alex Mashinsky did not respond to CoinDesk’s emailed request for comment.  Mashinsky’s transfers came as he and his beleaguered enterprise gear up for a second hearing in a federal bankruptcy court in New York next week. At the same time, the Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC) formed to protect the interests of those who deposited money on the Celsius platform, is preparing to investigate Mashinsky and other insiders.  Celsius faced financial difficulties and froze withdrawals in June, then filed for bankruptcy protection on July 13. The CEL coin issued by the crypto lending platform as a utility token has also faces regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for not being registered as a security.  Mashinsky is reportedly among the largest individual CEL holders after Celsius’ treasury. Long before its financial woes, Celsius publicly listed the largest CEL owners on its web page.

42395019,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWjtq,1660069423,"Coinbase Executives Misled Shareholders About Public Listing, New Lawsuit Alleges","Coinbase (COIN) made history last year when it became the first crypto exchange to go public in the U.S. Now, a shareholder wants the exchange’s executives to pay damages to the firm for allegedly mismanaging its public listing, according to a complaint filed with a federal court in Delaware.  The complaint, filed with the U.S. District Court in Delaware, was made by Donald Kocher on behalf of Coinbase Global, Inc. It alleges the company’s leadership made “false and misleading statements” in the firm’s public filings ahead of its direct listing in April 2021. Those statements allowed investors to purchase company shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange without the involvement of intermediaries like Wall Street investment banks, he claims.  Kocher accuses nine former and current Coinbase officers, including CEO Brian Armstrong, Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas and board member Marc Andreessen (co-founder of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz), of violating federal securities law, abusing their power, causing financial harm to the firm and “gross mismanagement.”  “Coinbase’s business, goodwill and reputation with its business partners, regulators and shareholders have been gravely impaired,” said the complaint, filed on Aug. 4.  A shareholder can sue executives on behalf of the company, in what is called a shareholder derivative suit like this one. Coinbase can be sued this way because it is publicly traded.  This lawsuit is the latest in a series of litigious actions taken by Coinbase investors against the exchange in recent months. On Thursday, an aspiring class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, accusing Coinbase of, among other things, allowing U.S. persons to trade unregistered securities.  Coinbase is currently being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the alleged sale of securities, a probe that was strengthened by a separate insider trading action involving a former Coinbase employee. The crypto exchange is also trying to send to arbitration two separate lawsuits filed by disgruntled investors.  Read more: SEC Calls 9 Cryptos 'Securities' in Insider Trading Case  Allegations  The lawsuit filed in Delaware, where Coinbase was incorporated, states the company made misleading statements in its registration form with the SEC, filed in February 2021, months before the direct listing. The suit points specifically to the alleged failure of Coinbase’s growth strategy, referred to as “flywheel” in the file.  “Our unique approach draws retail users, institutions and ecosystem partners to our platform, creating a powerful flywheel: retail users and institutions store assets and drive liquidity, enabling us to expand the depth and breadth of crypto assets that we offer, and launch new, innovative products and services that attract new customers,” Coinbase said in its SEC registration statement.  But the increased volume on Coinbase ruptured its “flywheel” cycle, the suit alleges, adding that the crypto exchange increasingly suffered system disruptions and delays due to heavy demand. However, the complaint only references six such disruptions in 2019 and 12 incidents in 2020 in support of its claim. Coinbase went public in 2021.  Kocher’s suit also alleges Coinbase executives violated the Securities Act of 1933, which compels companies to provide “full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce.”  Aside from damaging the company’s image and reputation, the suit alleges, “Coinbase has been, and will continue to be, severely damaged and injured by the Defendants’ misconduct.”  The file says compensation and benefits paid to the named executives and board members who violated the securities law is unjust enrichment. It also states that losses in market capital and costs of defending the company against legal action is damaging Coinbase, and asks a jury to award damages to the firm from the defendants (and cover Kocher’s legal costs).

42411423,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNebQ,1660069420,"As Government Takes on the Tornado Mixer, It May Reap a Whirlwind","In the late 15th century, in what is now Germany, a monk wrote a book about magic.  It was not actually about magic.  The three-volume “Steganographia,” authored by the Benedictine abbot Johannes Trithemius, described the use of spirits to communicate secretly over long distances. Trithemius was suspected of black magic, and the Catholic Church added “Steganographia” to its list of forbidden books, the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, where it would remain until 1900.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But the Church may not have blacklisted Trithemius’ work out of fear of spiritual corruption, for the “Steganographia” was not what it seemed. Though it spoke of angels and spirits, its real subject was far more dangerous: encryption.  Written in 1499, “Steganographia” is one of the first major works on cryptography in the West, introducing, for instance, the now-widespread idea of a simple cipher that could replace the letters of a message systematically. Among others, the book uses what’s known as the “Ave Maria” cipher, replacing each letter of a message with a short Latin sentence about Jesus. It is now widely suspected the book’s blacklisting had little to do with religion but was an attempt to suppress knowledge of cryptography. (I tell this story in more depth in my 2018 book “Bitcoin Is Magic.”)  You can likely imagine how threatening a looming explosion of concealed written messages would have been to the various warlords and strongmen who ruled Europe at the time (more than a few of them wearing church garb). The theology of the divine right of kings held up by Trithemius’ church implied that most people didn’t have the right to any privacy, or to much of anything else.  Read more: US Government Amps Up Inevitable Clash With Crypto Privacy in Tornado Cash Blacklisting  A half-millennium later, another Index Librorum Prohibitorum has been trotted out by a powerful governing force. Monday, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) placed a decentralized privacy service called Tornado Cash on its Specially Designated Nationals list. This makes interacting with the service illegal for U.S. nationals and entities.  But the impact and even intent seem even broader than that: Tornado Cash developer Roman Semenov claimed Tuesday his Github code repository account had been suspended. Semenov has not personally been sanctioned by OFAC, and he plays no direct role in the Tornado Cash service. Instead, he has coordinated the creation of code that can be run by other people to form a decentralized network. Writing on Twitter, Semenov nailed the key question raised by his reported suspension:  “Is writing open-source code illegal now?”  What is Tornado Cash?  Tornado Cash is a “mixer” on the Ethereum network. In broad strokes, it allows Ethereum users to send either ether (ETH) or ERC-20 tokens to the service to be “mixed” with other users’ tokens before being sent back, helping obscure who sent what to who and when. While Ethereum has basically nonexistent privacy controls by default, Tornado Cash is apparently quite effective – if it wasn’t, OFAC might not have bothered blacklisting it. And because the code is transparent, decentralized and automated, Tornado Cash can be trusted to do what it says on the tin.  OFAC has very legitimate reasons for wishing Tornado Cash didn’t exist. According to the agency, Tornado was used by North Korea’s Lazarus Group to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of proceeds from the hacks of huge crypto projects including the Ronin bridge. It has been suggested that North Korea uses the proceeds from such hacks to fund weapons programs, so stopping that seems like it would be pretty good for the world.  But OFAC’s sanction is itself an indiscriminate dirty bomb of catastrophic proportions, poised to vaporize the fundamental human rights of millions of people globally as it (maybe) stops the activities of one tiny and impoverished nation. There are innumerable reasons for everyday non-criminals to use a service like Tornado Cash, from making anonymous political donations to concealing the extent or location of their private wealth.  Even Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin jumped into the discussion to admit he had used Tornado Cash to obfuscate donations to the Ukraine war effort – not, he claims, to protect himself, but to protect recipients in Ukraine.  This is a problem not just ethically, but legally. OFAC’s sanction, and even more so subsequent attempts by the likes of Github to squelch the Tornado Cash code, may point to intense internal contradictions in U.S. law. It’s not quite fair to blame OFAC singularly for this: A regulator’s job is, generally, to attack a single problem rather than to think through the broader consequences.  Responsibility for the big picture falls instead mostly to legislators and, particularly in this case, the judiciary.  Is code speech?  From a legal standpoint, understanding what Tornado Cash does may be less important than understanding what it is. It is not a company or a human or even a machine with a physical presence. It is open-source code – text, commands, numbers and words – that executes a certain scheme of commands when compiled and deployed in its intended environment.  Tornado Cash, then, is a network of peer-to-peer channels, rather than a discrete company, entity or service. So while the sanctioning document targets Tornado Cash by name, and lays out a series of specific Ethereum addresses associated with it, the code could in principle be redeployed under a different name and utilizing different addresses. It seems likely this would set up a kind of “whack-a-mole” situation as new iterations of Tornado Cash are sanctioned as quickly as they appear.  That could hint at why someone may have leaned on Github owner Microsoft (MSFT) to ban Semenov. The real threat here isn’t the operational Tornado Cash service on Ethereum, but the infinitely and freely replicable code that makes it work.  Read more: Someone Is Trolling Celebs by Sending ETH From Tornado Cash  That means OFAC faces a serious constitutional challenge in trying to quash it: As the Washington, D.C., lobbying group Coin Center has pointed out, various legal judgments have concluded that both money and computer code can be forms of speech protected by the First Amendment. In the case of money, that seems to particularly apply to monetary political donations.  That puts Semenov in the company of both Johannes Trithemius and, more recently, Phil Zimmerman, the inventor of PGP encryption, an effectively unbreakable public-key encryption scheme. Zimmerman released PGP in 1991, declaring it “guerrilla freeware.” But within months the National Security Agency had declared PGP a sanctioned “munition” so dangerous for warfare that it should not be legally distributed.  Zimmerman fought a multi-year legal battle before two federal court decisions in 1996 declared that the encryption techniques were protected by the First Amendment. It seems plausible that a similar conclusion might be reached by courts considering OFAC’s actions against the Tornado Cash code.  This is a fundamental dilemma for the U.S., and even for global jurisprudence and social structure. There are very good reasons to not want North Korea or anyone else to be able to freely conceal global financial activity.

Bain Capital, an investment firm with around $155 billion in assets under management, debuted its first crypto-focused fund earlier this year.  Other participants in the round included Geometry, D1 Ventures and Cota Capital. RISC Zero previously raised $2 million in a pre-seed round led by Geometry and Ramez Naam Ventures.  Zero-knowledge proofs use cryptography to mathematically validate a transaction without revealing the content of the transaction. RISC Zero specifically uses the zk-STARKs proofs developed by StarkWare, which raised $100 million in a May funding round at an $8 billion valuation.  In March, RISC Zero released its first open-source product, a virtual machine that allows developers to build zk proofs that can be executed on any computer using traditional or blockchain-focused programming languages.  A developer preview of RISC Zero’s new network will launch in the third quarter ahead of the company’s own scalable blockchain.  Seattle-based RISC Zero was founded by a team of machine-learning veterans. CEO Brian Retford and Chief Science Officer Jeremy Bruestle formerly co-founded Vertex.AI, which was acquired by Intel. Technology chief Frank Laub worked at Vertex.Ai and spent time as a deep learning engineer at Intel. Ashleigh Schap recently joined RISC Zero as chief strategy officer after serving as growth lead at Uniswap Labs, the developer of leading decentralized exchange Uniswap.

Therefore, the number one crypto by market cap appears to be lagging which translates into a decline in Bitcoin dominance. As seen below, this metric has been moving sideways since May 2022 after seeing a small push to the upside. In 2021, as Ethereum and other altcoins reached new all-time highs, Bitcoin dominance plummeted to its current levels. If the current trends continue, Bitcoin lagging the altcoin sector, the metric could re-test its yearly lows and drop from 43% into the high 30% area which could provide altcoins with more room to reclaim previously lost territory. According to a report from Arcane Research, their Crypto Indexes for altcoins have been showing positive returns in August.

42395024,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWjyl,1660068008,Morgan Stanley’s New PAVA Indicator Divides ETH Users Into ‘Believers’ and ‘Speculators’,"Morgan Stanley has introduced a new speculation indicator – a tool called PAVA (price-adjusted volume per address) that uses speculative activity among traders to forecast ether (ETH) pricing.  The indicator, calculated by dividing the cryptocurrency price in U.S. dollars by the ratio of the blockchain transaction volume to active wallet addresses (90-day average), will allow investors to estimate ether price trends, particularly when undergoing extreme market lows.  “The key assumption for the PAVA indicator is that the blockchain, or specifically the layer 1 blockchain, is valued as a network,” Morgan Stanley wrote.  The indicator differentiates price movement based on market fundamentals from price movement based on network usage, and divides crypto market participants into two groups: believers and speculators.  Believers are confident in Ethereum’s long-term value and participate in on-chain protocols such as staking and decentralized lending, which increases network transaction volume and results in a lower PAVA value.  Speculators are less well-integrated into the Ethereum ecosystem and react to short-term price movement, causing increases in active wallet addresses to outpace increases in transaction volume and resulting in a higher PAVA value.  Morgan Stanley said that the indicator is stronger at identifying lower, than higher, market extremes. PAVA has been cyclical in past years and tends to bottom out below 0.1 and peak above 0.29. The indicator recently dipped below the low threshold on June 16, two days before ETH hit a bottom of $880.18.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jimmy He,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/09/morgan-stanleys-new-pava-indicator-divides-eth-users-into-believers-and-speculators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0307309aac25621254877537d657241f4aae3dde-3458x2593.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although Celsius never registered with Canada’s provincial securities regulators, authorities in the country are working with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the trans-border issue, the Financial Post, a Toronto-based newspaper, reported Tuesday. Regulators have launched investigations across jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada to look into the insolvent lender’s post-crash actions.  The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) is also investigating how Celsius' collapse and subsequent bankruptcy has affected the platform’s Canadian users. In Quebec, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) is investigating the ramifications of Celsius’ mid-June effort to freeze withdrawals.  The SEC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, and the OSC wasn't immediately available for comment.  Celsius Network, a crypto lending platform that once held $28 billion in assets under management, lost 88% of its assets in its mid-June crash, sending shock waves through the wider crypto world and prompting dozens of other crypto exchanges to freeze customer withdrawals.  The firm filed for bankruptcy protection in July. It has told the court it owes its users about $4.7 billion.

If an open metaverse develops, existing risks from digital assets may have systemic financial stability consequences, they said in a blog post on Tuesday. Regulatory bodies, including the BoE, international financial watchdog Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the global standard setter for banking regulations, are looking to set standards and regulations to limit potential crypto risks.  “Widespread adoption of crypto in the metaverse, or any other setting would require compliance with robust consumer protection and financial stability regulatory frameworks,” economist Owen Lock and policy analyst Teresa Cascino wrote.  The metaverse is a virtual reality where people can buy and sell digital property using non-fungible tokens that are tied to the blockchain. Some see it as a digital representation of the real world, where people even hold jobs. Some artists have already set up galleries in it, and celebrities and even banks have dived in. In February, it was described as a $5 trillion opportunity by Morgan Stanley.  A larger metaverse means households may hold a greater proportion of their wealth in crypto and more companies may decide to accept crypto payments, the researchers said. Financial institutions and banks may decide to increase their exposure to crypto.  On top of that, people employed in the metaverse could risk losing their jobs if the crypto market performs badly and metaverse activity drops, the researchers said.  “An important step is therefore for regulators to address risks from crypto assets' use in the metaverse before they reach systemic status,” the researchers said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/09/a-growing-metaverse-poses-systemic-risks-regulators-need-to-recognize-boe-researchers-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2048e765679002937798e67da5b3bce3486df366-1105x829.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The native token of the now bankrupt Celsius Network had taken a nosedive when the company had first filed for bankruptcy, but it seems the time is changing with the recent recovery. As Celsius continues with its proceedings, the price of CEL has shot up over the last week, reaching as high as $2. What Is Behind CEL Recovery? The recovery in CEL&apos;s price has obviously come as a surprise to the market. The altcoin had struggled tremendously before finding its footing once more.

Affected wallets include those controlled by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, TV host Jimmy Fallon, clothing brand Puma and a wallet created for donations to Ukraine, according to Etherscan. Prominent crypto figures such as artist Beeple and more mainstream celebrities such as comedian Dave Chappelle received ether (ETH).  The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) – a watchdog agency of the U.S. government – sanctioned Tornado Cash on Monday, prohibiting U.S. persons and entities from interacting or transacting with the privacy tool.  READ MORE: Crypto-Mixing Service Tornado Cash Blacklisted by US Treasury  A U.S. person includes anyone on U.S. soil as well as any American citizen abroad. Tornado Cash is a mixer, a protocol designed to pool funds in an effort to obfuscate the origin of any given transaction. U.S. officials alleged that a significant number of funds flowing through the mixer were tied to criminal activities, such as North Korea’s proceeds from hacking various crypto exchanges and services.  The idea to send 0.1 ETH to celebrity wallets appears to have originated on Twitter in a Monday post by user Depression2019, who has since retweeted screengrabs from the on-chain transactions.  The gag effectively points out the absurdity of such sanctions for users receiving funds from blacklisted addresses that they have no power to decline. The open nature of crypto is designed to cut out intermediaries, unlike the traditional financial sector that would use banks and other financial institutions to act as gatekeepers against such transactions.  Because Tornado Cash is a sanctioned entity, U.S. persons would likely be under a legal obligation to block incoming transactions from its wallets. OFAC rules mandate that U.S. persons freeze any transactions or funds sent from Tornado Cash.  It isn’t possible to block an incoming transfer on-chain, so exchanges and other parties would most likely have to block the addresses.  This may not be easy for celebrities and businesses with public wallets that aren’t operated by an exchange or similar type of business.

42395007,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWjkz,1660056009,"Inflation Probably Slowed in July, but Not by Enough to Trigger Crypto Bull Run","The cost of living in the U.S. likely cooled in July, but the decline may not be enough to deter the Federal Reserve from making more aggressive rate hikes. Higher interest rates this year have roiled crypto markets this year and helped to send the price of bitcoin plunging.  The increase in the consumer price index from a year ago probably slowed to 8.7% in July from June’s four-decade high of 9.1%, based on a survey of economists by data provider FactSet.  The slight decline would still leave inflation well above the Fed’s target of 2%. Besides, so-called core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy components, is forecast to have increased to 6.1% from 5.9%.  “The headline CPI is expected to be lower than the previous reading, but we think it may be premature for the market to be pricing in the Fed pivot given the strength of the economic data released last week,” Dick Lo, founder and CEO of quant-driven trading firm TDX Strategies, told CoinDesk.  Many investment banks now believe that the projected CPI decline won’t be enough to prompt the Fed to slow the pace of its rate hikes from the 75 basis point moves it has made at its last two meetings. Dovish expectations have stabilized risk assets, including bitcoin, in recent weeks.  The monthly inflation readings have gained prominence this year, because they influence Fed policy and the demand for the dollar, often a countervailing factor in the price of bitcoin. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, has rallied by 11% this year, as the Fed embarked on its most aggressive tightening cycle in over two decades. Bitcoin has dropped by 50%.  Little wiggle room for Fed  According to Canada's Scotiabank, the July CPI could reinforce renewed expectations for bigger rate hikes stemming from last Friday’s stellar jobs report. Derivatives markets are back to pricing in a 75 basis point hike for September after leaning toward a 50 basis point move last month.  Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, expects the core CPI to tick higher to 6.1%, from 5.9%.  “If that view proves to be correct,” Hold wrote in a note to clients on Friday, then it would mean the annualized month-over-month core CPI would be close to 7.5%, in line with the recent three-month moving average. Such a report would “indicate that inflationary pressures remain hot.""  Holt said markets have been pricing in rate cuts starting in early 2023, and he would rather have the Fed overdo tightening to ensure inflation winds down without “boomeranging back upon us.”  “Markets to counsel otherwise could be tantamount to thinking you know more than your doctor and stopping your course of antibiotics midway,” Holt noted.  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last month that the central bank may slow rate hikes at some point to assess the impact of tightening on inflation and the economy. However, things aren’t at that point yet, according to Goldman Sachs.  ""Next week’s inflation report seems very unlikely to offer ‘compelling evidence’ of a slowdown,"" Goldman's economic research team wrote in Friday’s edition of the Global FX Trader note. They cited “stiffer shelter costs” as one reason for revising up their core inflation forecasts for this year.  ""With the market still pricing cuts next year, the bottom line is that we still see upside risks to inflation and policy pricing over the next few months,"" the analysts wrote.  Rapid wage growth and an overheated labor market highlighted by Friday's nonfarm payrolls report suggest low odds of a significant decline in inflation anytime soon.  Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, voiced a similar opinion in a weekly note, forecasting an above-consensus core CPI that would be ""too hot for the central bank's tastes.""  Bitcoin’s fate tied to the dollar  Bitcoin may turn lower if the inflation print revives the stalled dollar rally. And to the dismay of bitcoin bulls, investment banks expect the greenback to remain strong through the rest of the year.  “We expect the USD to remain strong for the rest of this year. The overheating U.S. economy and the hawkish Fed have a lot to do with the strong USD. For the USD to weaken, the Fed has to be more concerned about growth than about inflation, and we are not there yet,"" Bank of America's global FX team wrote in a note to clients on Friday.

The New York-based company, which became listed in a merger with a special purpose acquisition vehicle last August, posted a net loss of $29 million for the second quarter, compared with a net loss of $17.5 million for the first quarter.  The miner has 1.3 exahashes per second (EH/s) running at its 40 megawatt facility in Alborz, Texas, and another 0.6 EH/s of computer power that was en route to two other facilities. Mining rigs will ""soon"" start shipping to a 205 MW site, its largest, according to the earnings report.  The fleet will be running at an efficiency of 32.1 joules per terahash (J/TH) that was bought at an average price of $34.96 per terahash/second (TH/s). That's lower than the $45 TH/s it reported in the first quarter and in line with market pricing. Rigs with efficiency of under 38 J/TH are priced at $35.20 per TH/s, according to information platform Luxor Hashrate Index.  Cipher has put down $196.7 million in deposits for equipment, down from $207 million in the first quarter, according to the report. It has mostly paid off its equipment contract with Bitmain for 27,000 rigs, barring a final payment that it plans to cover with a company credit, CEO Tyler Page said during the earnings call on Tuesday.  It is now starting to accept deliveries for 60,000 rigs from MicroBT. The miner is in talks with MicroBT to ""better align"" deliveries with the construction progress of the data center, Page said.  Cipher has secured a fixed price of about $27 per megawatt hour (about 2.7 cents per kilowatt hour) for its biggest site in Odessa, Texas, which is significantly lower than competitors in the region, the CEO said.  Earlier this year, Cipher cut its 2022 power capacity forecast from 405 MW, including 305 MW for self-mining, to 345 MW, including 275 MW for self-mining. The rest will go to hosting other companies' rigs.  The firm has no corporate debt, other than its share of an equipment financing agreement for the Alborz site, which is around $11 million, according to the report.

Market Moves: A report from Coinbase said layer 2 blockchains could siphon revenue away from Ethereum. The future of layer 2s could be a “zero-sum game” because the layer 2 that houses the majority of dapps could “power the entirety of the Ethereum ecosystem,” the report said.  Chart of The Day: Bitcoin's correlation with Nasdaq hits its lowest since January.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were down 3% on the day, while U.S. stock futures inched lower as investors waited for the release of U.S. consumer price data on Wednesday. The dollar extended a decline.  The consumer price data could set expectations for how the Federal Reserve will approach monetary policy and whether it will continue to raise rates aggressively.  According to Matteo Bottacini, a trader at Crypto Finance AG, volatility won't spike before or after the economic data is released.  “As a consequence, I see risky assets inching higher,” Bottacini wrote in a morning note to investors. “Then again, geopolitical tensions coupled with the released earnings might weigh on equities – and, consequently, on crypto.”  Eth, Eth, Eth  Bottacini pointed out that the hot topic now is the upcoming Merge on the Ethereum network. The basis (the spread between futures price and spot price) for ether widened with September futures on crypto exchange FTX at a $10 discount, and in December at a $40 discount.  “This is the consequence of many stories and rumors about the possibility of having a forked proof-of-work ETH and a proof-of-stake coin,” Bottacini said. “Traders are buying the spot ETH and selling the longer-term future to take advantage of this possibility. Therefore, holding ETH will let you receive the forked asset that might be quite valuable.”  On Monday, JPMorgan analyst Ken Worthington said anticipation of the Merge helped drive ether's big move higher in July and boosted crypto in general.  After two tests were completed ahead of the event, ether's price jumped 70% in July, compared with bitcoin's 27% increase.  Tron founder Justin Sun said in an interview with CoinDesk TV that he supports the post-Merge Ethereum fork, saying he thinks the proof-of-work way of operating is an ""essential"" component of Ethereum.  CoinDesk’s Daniel Kuhn reported that Ethereum fees are at their lowest level in two years. The average cost for a transaction is under 12.5 gwei. A gwei is a unit of account that represents a fraction of an ETH used to measure the transaction fees needed to run Ethereum. That’s less than half the gwei needed to use Ethereum at the end of July.  As for the rest of the crypto market, altcoins took a hit Tuesday with filecoin (FIL) down 11%, Uniswap’s UNI down 8% and Avalanche (AVAX) down 6.5%. On Monday, Robinhood Markets announced that customers can now buy and sell AVAX through Robinhood Crypto.  In the news  Cryptocurrency exchange Zipmex will release ether to users' wallets on Friday with bitcoin following a week later. The platform blocked customers from taking direct custody of their coins last month.  Crypto-focused data analytics platform Messari plans to raise fresh financing at a $300 million valuation, according to The Block. Messari founder and CEO Ryan Selkis declined to comment on the funding, but tweeted: ""I don’t comment on market rumors related to Messari, but… We’ve scaled to 130 people on zero net operating burn, had a record July, and are hiring $35mm worth of developers to help bring transparency and institutional-grade data tool to the crypto market.""  And finally, Singapore-based Amber Group, which provides liquidity and market-making services mostly in Asia, has expanded its retail trading operation to Brazil. Called WhaleFin, the retail platform – which allows users to buy and sell crypto as well as take out loans – has been operating in Brazil since June.

A layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s. A decentralized application (dapp) is a digital app that uses blockchain technology to keep users’ data out of the hands of the organizations behind it.  The future of layer 2s could be a “zero-sum game” because the layer 2 that houses the majority of dapps could “power the entirety of the Ethereum ecosystem,” the report said. There is about $68.9 billion in total value locked on Ethereum, compared with $5.2 billion across layer 2s, the report said.  While the TVL in layer 2s is relatively small, the implementation of zero knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVM) is looking more achievable and could lead to “major traction” in layer 2 growth, the note said.  Coinbase says that if more user activity moves to layer 2s and those blockchains need their own tokens to enable transactions, that could reduce the staking yields to Ethereum validators , cutting their revenue. That could reduce staking on the platform and increase the amount of ether (ETH) circulating, potentially damaging the cryptocurrency’s price. A decline in validators could also have a negative impact on the overall security of the network, the report said.  For the time being, transacting on Ethereum's main network will provide a solution for users who need or value “security over speed,” the report said, noting that losses on cross-chain bridge exploits have reached $2 billion this year.  More activity accumulating to an application on layer 2 would reduce congestion and fees on the layer 1 and that could result in better price discovery for ETH, the note said.  Chart of the Day: Bitcoin's Correlation With Nasdaq the Lowest Since January  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin seems to be decoupling from traditional markets amid the optimism stemming from Ethereum's impending Merge.  The 90-day correlation co-efficient between bitcoin and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has dropped to 0.37, the lowest since January, according to data provided by charting platform TradingView.  In other words, the positive correlation between the two is at its weakest level in seven months, and the leading cryptocurrency is now relatively less sensitive to equity markets and perhaps macro factors than it was early this year.

The launch of the upgrade, also known as the Merge, is to be within August 2022. Many experts in the system have confidence that Merge could be a bullish event that would positively impact the blockchain. But there are still some concerns about the possible post-merge hard forks on the network. When it comes to the cryptocurrency space, every network has a consensus mechanism for its operations. This is what helps in the validation of transactions and to maintain the security of the ecosystem. Also, it ensures the positive sustainability of the network by creating new blocks and tokens. The most popularly used mechanisms are the Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Related Reading: Decentraland Blooms In Green In Last 4 Days; Boosts Traders&apos; Appetite In MANA The Ethereum blockchain has been using the PoW mechanism, which requires a mining process for its transaction validation. The process consumes a lot of electricity or energy as it requires using computing machines. Also, most miners use fossil fuels to generate power, creating environmental pollution through carbon emissions.

Import Order Worth $10 Million According to the latest news agency, Iran placed its first import order to be paid with crypto worth $10 million. The government amended Iran&apos;s digital assets law two years ago to allow locally mined crypto for making payments of imported orders. Alireza Peyman-Pak, an official at the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade, stated (in Farsi) that by the end of September, Iranians would be using cryptocurrencies and smart contracts in foreign trade with target countries. The agency did not clarify the cryptocurrency used in the transaction. Iran is subject to a complete economic boycott imposed by the United States, prohibiting imports from its banking, shipping, and oil sectors. In 2019, the government legalized crypto mining in Iran, making crypto mining legal both outside and inside metropolises. The electricity price offered to the miners was either equal to the average Iranian rial cost at which Iran exported its electricity to various nations or equal to 70% of the average rial price the country used to ship off its natural gas.

42413900,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAlsy5,1660050131,Understanding the Currency Sector in CoinDesk Indices DACS,"Max Good, senior index research analyst at CoinDesk Indices, contributed writing for this report.  Introduction  In December 2021, CoinDesk Indices launched its digital asset classification standard (DACS) to set the standard for defining the industries of digital assets. Each of the top 500 digital assets by market capitalization is assigned to an industry defined by DACS, and then at least one industry is assigned to an industry group. Finally, at least one industry group is assigned to a sector.  There are now six sectors defined by DACS, including currency, computing, DeFi (decentralized finance), digitization, culture and entertainment and smart contract platform. The Currency sector is the largest in DACS with 146 assets representing 59.4% of the digital asset market, which was worth about $1 trillion in market capitalization as of April 30.  In this paper, we describe the Currency sector in further detail by discussing its definition, constituents and significance in the broader digital asset market.  Exhibit 1: CoinDesk Indices DACS  Defining the Currency sector in DACS  Currency is the sector with the first digital asset, bitcoin. Bitcoin was launched in 2009. It paved the way for the development of many other digital assets.  Fundamentally, the Currency sector represents the purest and most basic form of peer-to-peer payment in the digital asset market, but it can take on the other traditional monetary characteristics, namely as a store of value and unit of account. As the crypto business evolves, other properties such as privacy and special-purpose permissioned blockchains grow in demand.  The DACS glossary defines the Currency Sector as follows:  The Currency sector refers to any digital asset acting primarily as a medium of exchange and unit of account running on a blockchain network with the ability to complete cross-border transactions without restriction. Digital assets in the Currency sector don't necessarily act as a store of value.  Industry groups inside the Currency sector in DACS  The industry assignments of digital assets in the Currency sector can be consolidated into four industry groups: transparent, stablecoin, blockchain as a service (BaaS) and private.  Transparent is the most traditional type of digital asset in the Currency sector and includes any digital asset that uses an open, permissionless and trustless blockchain. As opposed to private currencies, transparent currencies display the deposit addresses and token balances of both senders and receivers on the ledger. Transparent currencies can serve a range of different purposes, but fundamentally, they empower users to take control over their own finances.  Stablecoin refers to protocols whose native token is pegged to a fiat currency, most commonly the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins enable frictionless transfer and exchange of fiat-pegged assets on a blockchain. Stablecoin issuers may use one of several methods to maintain their peg, such as 1:1 dollar-backed reserves, multi-asset treasuries, collateralized lending, mint-and-burn mechanisms, etc.  Blockchain as a service describes protocols that are typically more centralized and use permissioned blockchains for narrowly defined purposes.  Private refers to protocols whose primary purpose is to maintain the anonymity of users and conceal their wallet balances. While typical blockchains have open, traceable and transparent ledgers, privacy-focused blockchains like Monero3 use a range of encryption techniques to obfuscate user-specific information without losing trust in network security, transaction finality and ledger verifiability.  All four industry groups in the Currency sector continue to see active growth and development as censorship-resistant and cross-border payment needs continue to grow and evolve around the globe.  Exhibit 2: Currency Sector Breakdown by Industry Group  Exhibit 3: Industry Groups Under Currency Sector  (Market capitalization data is based prices on April 30, 2022)  Industries inside the Currency sector in DACS  Each of the 146 assets in the Currency sector is assigned to a single industry before the industry is assigned to an industry group in the sector. There are eight industries that feed into the four industry groups that are mentioned above. Transparent DeFi currency, transparent CeFi (centralized finance) currency and transparent (other) are the three industries that are assigned to the transparent industry group, Stablecoin is the only industry that is assigned to the stablecoin industry group. Payments, supply chain/commerce and BaaS (other) are the three industries assigned to the BaaS industry group, and private is the only industry that is assigned to the private industry group.  The industries that make up the transparent industry group are dependent upon how they are distributed and controlled. Transparent DeFi currencies such as bitcoin are fully decentralized, transparent CeFi currencies are distributed by a central entity, and transparent (other) is made up of all digital assets that fall into the transparent industry group but couldn't be further classified.  As of April 30, transparent DeFi was the largest industry by market capitalization under the industry group with 31 assets totaling $765 billion in market cap, followed by transparent CeFi and transparent (other).  Exhibit 4: Industries Under the Transparent Industry Group  (Market capitalization data is based on prices from April 30, 2022)  Stablecoin refers to protocols whose native token is pegged to a fiat currency, most commonly the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins enable frictionless transfer and exchange of fiat-pegged assets on the blockchain. Stablecoin issuers may use one of several methods to maintain their peg, such as 1:1 dollar-backed reserves, multi-asset treasuries, collateralized lending, mint-and-burn mechanisms, etc.  In the BaaS industry group, payments such as Ripple tend to be geared toward businesses and governments, where decentralization is less of a concern and the blockchain can be streamlined for faster transaction speeds, lower fees and higher throughput.  Supply chain/commerce refers to protocols that enable producers, distributors and consumers to track, process and distribute goods and services using blockchain technology. BaaS (other) is made up of all digital assets that fall into the BaaS industry group but couldn't be further classified.  As of April 30, payments was the largest industry by market capitalization under the industry group with 14 assets totaling $35 billion in market cap, followed by supply chain/commerce and BaaS (other).  Exhibit 5: Industries Under the BaaS Industry Group  (Market capitalization data is based on prices on April 30.)  Private refers to protocols whose primary purpose is to maintain the anonymity of users and conceal their wallet balances. While typical blockchains have open, traceable and transparent ledgers, privacy-focused blockchains like Monero use a range of encryption techniques to obfuscate user-specific information without losing trust in network security, transaction finality and ledger verifiability.  Major assets in DACS Currency sector  There are 146 digital assets inside the Currency sector. The top asset, bitcoin (BTC), represents 69.3% of the sector, and the top 10 assets represent 92.7% of the sector. There are 146 assets in the transparent industry group, totaling $796 billion in market capitalization, with bitcoin being the largest. There are 20 assets in the stablecoin industry group, totaling $186 billion in market capitalization, with USD tether (USDT) being the largest. There are 42 assets in the BaaS industry group, totaling $45 billion in market capitalization with ripple (XRP) being the largest. In the private industry group, there are 11 tokens totaling around $9 billion in market capitalization with monero (XMR) being the largest.  Exhibit 6: Top 10 Assets Inside the DACS Currency Sector     Conclusion  The Currency Sector is the largest sector with continuing growth and increasing institutional interest. As the primary means for cryptocurrency payments, innovation in this sector revolves around optimizing some combination of security, transaction speed and throughput, which takes place either through innovative protocols or scaling systems. With bitcoin leading the way, the Currency sector is likely to remain the largest sector by market capitalization for the foreseeable future and the sector with the most institutional demand both in terms of direct investment in assets and capital investments supporting bitcoin-related infrastructure.  References  1. Bitcoin (BTC) is the world’s first cryptocurrency, and the largest by market capitalization. Since launching in 2009, Bitcoin has revolutionized payments with its innovation in blockchain technology, creating a global, borderless, secure, censorship-resistant, pseudonymous, permissionless and trustless medium of exchange. Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism makes the Bitcoin network the most secure in the world. When proper security measures are taken, a bitcoin wallet is effectively un-hackable. These features have contributed to an explosion in usage and popularity, and bitcoin has seen a massive influx of institutional and retail adoption, positioning itself as a brand-new asset class and a legitimate store of value.  2. Ripple (XRP) is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies, and the largest BaaS asset by market capitalization. Ripple is a permissioned blockchain, largely secured by, and for, banks. This allows it to boast nearly instantaneous transaction speeds and near-zero fees. Ripple has positioned itself as a payments and settlements solution for financial institutions, targeting the SWIFT system as a competitor.  3. Monero (XMR) is the largest private cryptocurrency by market capitalization and one of the oldest. Monero uses innovative ring signature and stealth address technologies to fully mask the on-chain identities of senders and receivers, as well as wallet balances. This ensures true anonymity to all network participants while still maintaining a verifiable, immutable ledger. Monero is also secured via a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, though its algorithm is different from that used to secure Bitcoin.  Disclaimer:  CoinDesk Indices, Inc.

42395016,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWjov,1660050000,Blockchain Analytics Platform Merkle Science Raises $19M to Take on Bridge Exploits,"Merkle Science, a predictive blockchain analytics platform, has added $19 million to its Series A funding round. The amount brings the total funds raised in the round to more than $24 million at an undisclosed valuation.  The capital will help Merkle expand in the U.S. and fund research and development for forensics and analytics tools for emerging technologies such as decentralized finance (DeFi), an area where Merkle is seeing interest among institutional investors, and cross-chain bridge protocols. DeFi refers to financial activities carried out on a blockchain without the need of third parties.  Security vulnerabilities in cross-chain bridges, which allow users to move assets between blockchains, have siphoned billions of dollars from the crypto industry this year, including the $200 million Nomad exploit last week.  “We’re seeing a lot of bridge protocols getting hacked. A large amount of R&D needs to be invested in that area,” Merkle co-founder and CEO Mriganka Pattnaik said in an interview with CoinDesk. “From a market perspective, they are very valuable, but since they are so new and relatively complex, there’s a large number of exploits.”  Founded in 2018, Merkle offers threat detection, risk mitigation and compliance tools that help crypto companies, financial institutions and government agencies identify and prevent cryptocurrency-related crimes. The platform uses machine learning to track suspicious crypto wallets based on behavioral patterns.  The funding extension was co-led by tech-focused venture capital firm Beco Capital, Darrow Holdings (a Susquehanna affiliate) and K3 Ventures.  Merkle raised additional funds to invest more in technology and market expansion. Founded in Singapore, the company expanded to the U.S. in late 2021. The plan is for senior leadership to be in the U.S. with regional teams in Singapore and London, Pattnaik said.

42395008,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWjly,1660049056,Former Terra-Affiliated Project Kujira to Issue Stablecoin,"Kujira, the crypto project that was building on the Terra Classic blockchain and moved to its own layer 1 protocol on Cosmos ecosystem after Terra’s implosion, is about to issue a stablecoin called USK, the firm announced Monday in a blog post.  “Inspiration” to craft USK came from decentralized lending protocol MakerDAO and its stablecoin DAI, Kujira's team said.  Kujira is a blockchain development project that was first active on the Terra network. The effort created ORCA, a liquidation tool on the Anchor lending platform. After Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and its stabilizer token, LUNC (then called luna), fell into a death spiral wiping out billions of dollars of investor money, Kujira moved to develop on the Cosmos protocol.  “As we plan to focus on payments and commerce and launch our own high-quality Kujira wallet, we felt that we would have far more flexibility for future integrations if we were able to launch our own native stablecoin,” the announcement said. “We rebuilt Kujira from the ashes of Terra Classic’s collapse. We understand just how important it is to handle a stablecoin correctly by pursuing transparency, community involvement, sustainable governance, while focusing on adoption and tangible value.”  Many stablecoins have struggled to keep their price stable in the last months as deleveraging and insolvencies hit crypto markets and blockchain firms. Central banks around the globe have been raising interest rates to combat surging inflation, drying up liquidity and driving investors to exit riskier investments, including crypto.  Read more: What's the Point of Stablecoins? Understanding Why They Exist  Kujira has designed USK to maintain its price stability through a combination of overcollateralization and trading incentives. The stablecoin is set to be “soft-pegged” to the U.S. dollar, allowing the exchange rate to deviate within a range versus a hard peg to $1.  Similar to DAI, USK would be overcollateralized by crypto assets, meaning that the stablecoin issuer’s treasury will hold more digital assets in value than the market capitalization of the stablecoin. The backing asset will initially be Cosmos’ native token, ATOM, with the team planning to add KUJI – the token issued by Kujira – in the near future, according to the post.  USK tokens can be minted (created) only by locking up crypto such as ATOM as collateral and borrowing USK against them for a 5% interest and a 0.5% minting fee. The fees that USK accrues will be distributed among KUJI token stakers. The interest rate and fee could be subject to change, according to the blog post.  The post emphasized that Kujira intends USK to be resistant to censorship. It explained that a key difference from DAI stablecoin is that USK doesn’t plan to hold Circle’s stablecoin USDC in its treasury to “avoid being easily censorable.” This line likely reflects news on Monday of the U.S. Treasury banning privacy-focused crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash, with Circle subsequently moving quickly to freeze the blacklisted addresses that interacted with the service.  USK will start its test mode on Friday, followed by two weeks of feedback before going live.  KUJI has rallied in the wake of the announcement. It is up 30% in the last 24 hours and trading higher than before the implosion of Terra in May. Cosmos’ ATOM is down 3.7% on the day in tandem with a general slump in the cryptocurrency market.

42395027,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWmum,1660046961,Ethereum Layer 2s Could Take Revenue From the Blockchain as They Become More Competitive: Coinbase,"The Ethereum blockchain needs layer 2 systems to help deal with its “shortcomings on cost and throughput,” though those same scaling products could leech revenue from the network as they become “competitive rather than complementary,” crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report Monday.  “It's feasible that layer 2s could become the application layers hosting the bulk of economic activity while Ethereum exists exclusively to store transaction data,” David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, wrote in the report.  A layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s. A decentralized application (dapp) is a digital app that uses blockchain technology to keep users’ data out of the hands of the organizations behind it.  The future of layer 2s could be a “zero-sum game” because the layer 2 that houses the majority of dapps could “power the entirety of the Ethereum ecosystem,” the report said. There is about $68.9 billion in total value locked on Ethereum, compared with $5.2 billion across layer 2s, the report said.  While the TVL in layer 2s is relatively small, the implementation of zero knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVM) is looking more achievable and could lead to “major traction” in layer 2 growth, the note said.  Coinbase says that if more user activity moves to layer 2s and those blockchains need their own tokens to enable transactions, that could reduce the staking yields to Ethereum validators , cutting their revenue. That could reduce staking on the platform and increase the amount of ether (ETH) circulating, potentially damaging the cryptocurrency’s price. A decline in validators could also have a negative impact on the overall security of the network, the report said.  For the time being, transacting on Ethereum's main network will provide a solution for users who need or value “security over speed,” the report said, noting that losses on cross-chain bridge exploits have reached $2 billion this year.  More activity accumulating to an application on layer 2 would reduce congestion and fees on the layer 1 and that could result in better price discovery for ETH, the note said.

42395031,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWmyi,1660046400,Renewable Energy Company Closes $4.3M Capital Round to Convert Landfill Methane Into Bitcoin,"Vespene Energy, a Berkeley, Calif.-based company that converts methane gas released from landfills into power for bitcoin mining, closed a $4.3 million funding round led by blockchain investment firm Polychain Capital and other climate-focused funds.  The company installs efficient micro-turbines on municipal landfills, which convert otherwise wasted methane gas into electricity to power bitcoin-mining data centers, according to a statement.  According to a U.N. report, methane is a harmful greenhouse gas with a 100-year global warming potential that is 28 times to 34 times greater than carbon dioxide. Citing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Vespene said that U.S. landfills account for 15% of U.S. methane emissions, but a recent NASA survey indicated that these numbers may be two times to three times higher.  “Due to the high costs and long lead times associated with building grid-connected landfill energy projects, over 70% of the country’s roughly 2,600 municipal landfills do not have a viable use for the methane they produce,” the company said in the statement.  Vespene enables landfill owners to turn harmful methane gas, which is a financial and environmental liability, into a potential revenue stream. Vespene, in turn, gets a cheap, renewable energy source for its bitcoin mining data centers.  “By using wasted methane to power bitcoin mining, Vespene is killing two birds with one stone – mitigating harmful GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions and helping transition Bitcoin mining toward carbon-neutral and carbon-negative energy sources,” the company said in the statement.  Bitcoin mining technology has shown promise for mitigating some greenhouse emission-related problems, despite outcries by some lawmakers that miners are harming the environment by using too much energy.  Miners have recently been setting up remote facilities to use otherwise-wasted natural gas to power mining operations. In the process, they have been reducing the amount of methane gas released into the atmosphere.  Vespene will use the fresh capital to launch its pilot site in California, making it the first company to convert wasted landfill methane into bitcoin, the company said. One Vespene module will take about four to six months to establish. Each module will have a power capacity of about 1.5 megawatts (MW) and eliminate 270,000 metric tons of CO2-equivalent per year, Vespene added.  The company’s business model also allows landfill owners to participate in a profit-sharing agreement that has a predetermined floor and ceiling. By letting the company set up its facility, landfill owners can capture a certain amount of upside via a profit-sharing arrangement during a bitcoin bull-run.  Meanwhile, having set limits on how much profit it has to relinquish, Vespene is able to hedge its downside during bearish markets.  “Our goal is to mitigate a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and help fuel the transition to a renewable energy future by using bitcoin mining to turn landfill methane streams into revenue streams for our customers,” Vespene Energy co-founder and CEO Adam Wright said in the statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/09/a-renewable-energy-company-closes-43m-funding-to-convert-landfill-methane-into-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15469da9854186f0b7dbc288bd52b70a97809f5d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the figure fell below its outlook range of $217 million to $223 million. The firm attributes this to a number of factors including crypto volatility.

Klaytn Foundation director Sangmin Seo announced the funding, called the Blockchain Research Center (BRC) Program, at Korea Blockchain Week on Monday. Seo said the commitment is one of the largest blockchain research programs in terms of funding grants.  Day-to-day operations will be run by a global team headed by researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Seoul and the National University of Singapore (NUS).  The blockchain is the second to announce an academic funding program this month. Earlier in August, the Algorand Foundation named the winners of its $50 million blockchain research and education program, including Yale, University of Cape Town and Monash University in Australia.  NUS ranked top worldwide in CoinDesk's 2021 University Rankings for Blockchain and KAIST placed 26th. Both are in the top 50 technology schools globally, according to QS World University Rankings, and are known in Asia for their strong science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs.  Klaytn, introduced by messaging app Kakao's blockchain arm Ground X, went live in 2019 and now has ""millions of users in Korea,"" it said. Its KLAY token has over $880 million in market cap, according to CoinGecko data, making it the 66th largest cryptocurrency. Its governing body at launch included electronics giant LG, with crypto exchange Binance and South Korea's Shinhan Bank joining later.  BRC will operate in an open-source manner, where research conducted will be publicly disclosed as research papers or open-source software. External researchers will be able to participate in existing research projects or submit their own proposals.  Seo said KAIST and NUS were selected from a pool of participating research institutes who submitted a proposal. Seven proposals were received from 62 research institutes in 11 countries, Seo said. The KAIST and NUS research group was selected by the Klaytn Governance Council.  CORRECTION (Aug. 10, 07:26 UTC): Clarifies that the fund was not awarded exclusively to the two named schools. They are helping run the program.",POSITIVE,KLAY,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH | KLAY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/09/korean-blockchain-project-klaytn-commits-20m-to-asian-universities-for-blockchain-research,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3abe2d64822298260453c542b1dedeb8c5c2f12-3000x1718.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Australia's central bank plans to create a CBDC, which will operate in a ring-fenced environment. A ring-fence environment separates a portion of the user's financial assets from the rest, potentially securing one from the other in case of a breach.  The project will take about a year to complete, according to an announcement on Tuesday.  In 2020, the RBA announced its intention to explore a potential CBDC with the development of a proof-of-concept (POC) for the issuance of a tokenized digital dollar for use by the wholesale market. Attention is now being turned to a potential CBDC for use by households and businesses.  While the central banks of almost every developed economy are at least exploring rolling out a CBDC, the jury is somewhat out on the necessity or desire for one in places like Australia, which the RBA acknowledges.  ""A question that has received less attention to date, especially in countries like Australia that already have relatively modern and well-functioning payment and settlement systems, is the use cases for a CBDC and the potential economic benefits of introducing one,"" the central bank said.  With China's digital currency, eCNY, being fairly well established and having received mainstream extended trials at the Winter Olympic Games in February, central banks elsewhere want to make sure they are not being left behind in the digital currency race.  The RBA will publish a paper in the next few months detailing its objectives for the projects and interested industry bodies will be able to participate.

It started with El Salvador&apos;s adoption of bitcoin as a legal tender, and it has spiraled from there. One thing that is yet to be done is a cryptocurrency backed by a nation. While other countries have gone the path of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the Central African Republic has introduced an innovative monetary system to the world. Sango Enters The Picture Sango is a Layer 2 solution that is built on top of the bitcoin blockchain. When they say Sango is bitcoin-backed, it doesn&apos;t mean just backed by BTC coins, but that the entire system is built atop the largest decentralized network in the world. The Sango sidechain is also backed by the Central African Republic, making it the first and only cryptocurrency ecosystem to be backed by a nation. The CAR, like other nations, has moved further in its drive to adopt digital assets as citizens of the world move in that direction.

On Monday, the virtual currency mixing business was added to the Office of Foreign Assets Control&apos;s (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals list, a running list of prohibited individuals, businesses, and cryptocurrency addresses. OFAC is a watchdog organization dedicated to avoiding sanctions violations. All U.S. individuals and organizations are barred from engaging with the crypto mixing service platform or other Ethereum wallet addresses. Those who do so risk facing legal repercussions. Tornado Cash Created to Hide Source of Payments The Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacker organization - linked to the $625 million March hack of Axie Infinity&apos;s Ronin Network, reportedly used Tornado Cash as a critical tool. Blockchain investigation revealed that Tornado Cash, created to hide the source of payments, was the conduit via which tens of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency stolen from Ronin passed. As stated by the Treasury Department, OFAC previously sanctioned a similar mixing business, Blender.io, and around $20.5 million in cryptocurrency taken from Ronin. On-chain data studies reveal that the Ronin hackers continued to use the currency mixer firm to launder Ronin proceeds even after OFAC sanctioned an Ethereum address linked to the Lazarus Group that it claimed was connected to the breach.

After the ongoing crypto market crash in 2022, users are looking for the best meme crypto to buy now. Currently, many whales and investors are looking to buy TAMA - a new NFT project that is aiming to change the gaming sector by introducing DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols. This guide will review one of the best new crypto meme coins and why whales are accumulating Tamadoge. Why Tamadoge has Gained the attention of Memecoin Whales in 2022 The sections below look at 5 reasons why Tamadoge is gaining attention among the meme coin whales in 2022. 1. Affordable Pricing On the 25th of July 2022, TAMA launched its beta presale phase. Investors can buy Tamdoge for $0.01 per token, with a minimum purchase of 1,000 tokens ($10). To buy TAMA, investors can either purchase ETH or USDT, and convert their holding to TAMA coins. On the other hand, users can buy TAMA with fiat currency via credit/debit card payment methods. Currently, early investors have bought over $100,000 of TAMA in the first two weeks of the Tamadoge beta sale. The low token price can potentially make TAMA one of the best low-cap crypto gems to buy in 2022. 2. Deflationary Token One of the benefits of buying Tamadoge is that it aims to be a deflationary token. For example, coins like Doge and Shiba Inu are not inflation-proof - since they provide an increase in the number of tokens supplied over time.

Bitcoin Surges Early and Then Holds Near $24K; Other Cryptos Climb  By James Rubin  Bitcoin bounded out of the starting gate Monday, cracking $24,000 at one point before settling just below this threshold as investors began a two-day wait for the latest inflation numbers.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $23,800, up more than 2% during the previous 24 hours. Bitcoin has been rallying over the past four days amid hopeful signs that inflation will soon be under control without triggering a steep recession.  ""Bitcoin remains near its recent highs as crypto traders are looking to see if the crypto winter is over,"" Oanda Senior Market Analyst Americas Edward Moya wrote in an email.  Ether followed a similar pattern, hitting a two-month high above $1,800 earlier in the day before taking a foothold slightly below this level. The second-largest crypto by market cap was recently up more than 4% over the previous day. Other major cryptos spent much of their day firmly in the green, with GRT soaring more than 16% and DOT rising over 7% at one point.  Beleaguered crypto lending platform Celsius Network skyrocketed more than 24% to trade at a higher price than before it encountered financial difficulties and halted user withdrawals in early June. But Brett Sifling, director at Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, told CoinDesk that CEL may have been swept up in a surge of speculative assets and meme stocks. And other market observers attributed the rise to a short squeeze organized on Twitter under the #CELShortSqueeze banner. They did not see a bright future for the coin.  Major indexes  Major equity indexes closed nearly flat following largely disappointing second-quarter earnings by a number of large brands, including software and computer chip manufacturer Nvidia (NVSA), which missed analysts' revenue expectations. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.1%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 0.1%  Inflation holds center stage on this week's investor watch list with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics releasing the July consumer price index on Wednesday. Many analysts expect an 8.7% increase, still hefty but down from the unexpectedly high 9.1% reading in June. The New York Federal Reserve offered further hope that price increases have reached a peak with the release of a survey showing rosier consumer expectations for inflation in 2023.  ""It’s inflation week, and all eyes are on the U.S. CPI report,"" wrote Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of the financial services firm Arca. ""Markets are looking for headline inflation to (finally) slow down. Signs of peak inflation abound, with commodity prices declining precipitously from their highs – historically a strong sign of an impending inflation slowdown.""  The crypto industry suffered its latest dose of bad news Monday with the announcement the U.S. Treasury Department has banned all Americans from using decentralized crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a watchdog agency tasked with preventing sanctions violations, on Monday added Tornado Cash to its Specially Designated Nationals list, a running tally of blacklisted people, entities and cryptocurrency addresses. Tornado Cash has been a key tool for the Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacking group tied to the $625 million March hack of Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network, according to the Treasury Department.  Polygon-based Web3 game Dragoma's supporters appear to have fallen victim to a $3.5 million rug pull, according to blockchain sleuth PeckShield. Dragoma, which launched just days ago, had said it planned to become a Web3 adventure game that incorporated non-fungible tokens (NFT) and elements of social media alongside its native token, DMA.  Still, Oanda's Moya struck an upbeat note about crypto pricing. ""The selling pressure has significantly eased and momentum traders could pounce on the break of the $25,000 level,"" he wrote.

Insights  Why Do We Need Ethereum PoW When We Have Ethereum Classic?  By Sam Reynolds  A month before the much anticipated Ethereum Merge a battle is brewing between Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tron’s Justin Sun.  Buterin is dismissive of efforts to maintain some form of proof-of-work (PoW) system for Ethereum after the blockchain goes through a transition to a less energy-intensive proof-of-stake (PoS) system.  “I'm not expecting EthereumPOW to have substantial, long-term adoption,” Buterin said at a press conference at ETH Seoul, part of the current Blockchain Megaweek in South Korea. “A couple of outsiders that have exchanges just want to make a quick buck. I just don't see this organic aspect to it.”  Unsurprisingly, when “quick buck” is mentioned, (His Excellency) Justin Sun emerges. (Sun is a Permanent Representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization.)  Tron’s Justin Sun is a cheerleader for an Ethereum hard fork that would maintain proof-of-work. Tron’s USDD would be the first stablecoin on what he is calling the ""EthereumPOW"" protocol. The Sun-backed Poloniex exchange would list it.  For his part, Sun says that Poloniex, which has taken the first steps toward listing an EthereumPOW token (ETHW) won’t be taking any fees from trading ETHW. It's all for the public good, he says.  Small volume  Regardless, CoinGecko data says there’s not much comparable market interest in it, with only $3.1 million in volume changing hands on the first day.  “I don't expect Ethereum to really be significantly harmed by another fork,” Buterin said at ETHSeoul. “My impression from everyone I talked to in the Ethereum ecosystem is that they've been completely supportive of the proof of stake effort, and the ecosystem has been quite united around it.”  Anyone who wants to remain using proof-of-work and Ethereum will just stick with Ethereum Classic, Buterin believes. (Ethereum Classic is what used to be Ethereum until a 2016 hack of The DAO, a smart contract platform running on Ethereum. What remained after a fork became Ethereum Classic, which has its own currency, ETC.)  “I think Ethereum Classic already has a superior community and a superior product for people kind of with those pro-proof-of-work values and preferences,” he said.  But do the markets agree with Buterin? CoinGecko data shows that Ethereum Classic has $1.16 billion in trading volume.  But it took almost two months for Ethereum Classic to test the $3.1 million mark in volume that EthereumPOW has already gotten to in daily volume, and over a year and a half for Ethereum Classic’s volume to consistently hit that waterline.  By that metric, it might be too early to tell if the market has rejected EthereumPOW. Maybe this is more than an attempt for outsiders to make a quick buck. But at the same time, do we really need two proof-of-work versions of Ethereum?
