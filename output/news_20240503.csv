26811233,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606448,1714777248,XRP Forms On-Chain Signal That Led To 16% Crash Last Time,"On-chain data shows that many old coins have moved on the XRP network recently, a sign that proved to be bearish for the coin last time. XRP Age Consumed Metric Has Registered A Large Spike According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, XRP has just observed a large movement of dormant coins similar to what the asset witnessed last month. The indicator of interest here is the “Age Consumed,” which shows “the amount of tokens changing addresses on a certain date, multiplied by the time since they last moved,” as per Santiment’s definition. Related Reading: Bitcoin Loses Historical Level, Analyst Says “Reclaim And Bounce, Or Die” When this metric has a high value, it means that a large number of coins previously dormant have finally been moved to the blockchain. Old coins are generally less likely to become involved in selling, as they belong to the more resolute hands in the market. As such, any large movements of these coins can be worth noting since it’s not an event that happens too often. The below chart shows the trend in this indicator for XRP over the past month or so: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on X From the graph, it’s visible that the XRP Age Consumed registered a sharp spike at the start of this month, implying that some old hands have decided to break their silence. This latest spike has been quite massive in scale and has been reminiscent of another spike that was seen last month. Interestingly, this previous spike occurred shortly before the price of the cryptocurrency tanked 16%. Thus, the previous spike would have corresponded to some HODLers moving to sell their coins. It’s possible that the latest large dormant coin movement was also made for a similar purpose, and hence, it can prove to be bearish for XRP. Santiment points out that this may not be so after all, though, saying: There is an argument that this old coin movement is related to potential #buythedip interest from key stakeholders, and prices have been climbing mildly since this May spike occurred. While this dormant coin movement may turn out to be bullish this time around, there is another signal brewing for the asset that can also be something to keep an eye on. As highlighted in the same chart, the Total Open Interest for XRP, which keeps track of the number of derivative positions currently open on all exchanges related to the asset, has been going up recently. This metric is now at a 3-week high of $483.4 million, implying that there is a notable amount of speculation in the market right now. Historically, this has led to volatility in the price. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Cardano “Ready For A Parabolic Bull Run,” Here’s Why In theory, this volatility can take the asset in either direction, but it’s worth noting that the crash last month occurred after the Open Interest hit extreme levels. So far, though, the indicator hasn’t quite yet reached the same highs. XRP Price XRP is yet to make any significant recovery from the crash last month as its price is still trading around $0.52.

42418311,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTdByH,1714774447,"Former Cred Executives Indicted on Wire Fraud, Other Charges","Three former executives with bankrupt crypto lender Cred were indicted Thursday on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and engaging in financial transactions for illicit purposes.  Daniel Schatt, a Cred co-founder and former CEO, Joseph Podulka, former CFO, and James Alexander, the former chief capital officer, were indicted by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of California. Schatt and Podulka were arrested and made their initial appearances in a San Francisco court earlier in the day, according to a press release published Friday.  Cred filed for bankruptcy in November 2020, estimating its liabilities to be between $100 million and $500 million at the time, but saying it had less than $100 million in estimated assets. At the time, the company blamed its failure on ""irregularities"" in how ""specific corporate funds"" were handled. A reorganization plan was later approved by a federal judge, according to court records.  Cred was among the first of a slate of high-profile crypto lender bankruptcies – preceding 2022's Celsius and Voyager bankruptcies by around two years.  Similar to these other failed companies, Cred offered a lending program, ""CredEarn,"" that accepted deposits from investors and offered market-leading interest rates before it filed for bankruptcy without enough money to pay back creditors. Depositors had entrusted more than $100 million worth of crypto with Cred by the time it collapsed.  ""[T]he defendants lured customers to make investments by promising to return a significant yield on cryptocurrency investments—the defendants did not disclose, however, that virtually all the assets to pay the yield were generated by a single company whose business was to make unsecured micro-loans to Chinese gamers,"" the U.S. Department of Justice said in a press release.  ""Contrary to the defendants’ assurances, Cred engaged in lending that was neither collateralized nor guaranteed. Moreover, Cred’s hedging strategy did not protect the company’s investments against volatility,"" the statement read.  ""The Cred Liquidation Trust and its professionals have been working tirelessly to pursue recoveries for creditors. We spent a lot of time and effort cooperating with law enforcement. We are thankful for the hard work and diligence by the DOJ and FBI, which resulted in indictments of the key executives responsible for the first major crypto bankruptcy case in the United States,"" said attorneys Darren Azman and Joseph Evans with McDermott Will & Emery LLP, who are the lead counsel for the Cred Inc. Liquidation Trust.  In its 2020 bankruptcy filing, Cred put most of the blame for its collapse on the failure of an outside investment manager, Quantcoin, with whom Cred entrusted 800 BTC – worth around $10 million at the time. Later on, the Cred Liquidation Trust alleged in a lawsuit that most of the lost customer funds had, in fact, been quietly loaned out to the Chinese micro-lender MoKredit, which ultimately failed to repay its debts.  MoKredit made most of its money from unsecured loans to Chinese gamers,and its relationship with Cred – along with the fact that the two companies shared a co-founder – was not properly disclosed to Cred creditors, according to Friday's indictment.  The Cred Liquidation Trust has separately alleged that Cred funneled users into CredEarn through the retail-oriented crypto exchange Uphold, which at one point counted Cred Founder Dan Schatt as a board member. '""Uphold drove thousands of retail customers to lend cryptocurrency to the CredEarn program by falsely marketing it as 'safe,' 'secured,' 'insured,' and 'fully hedged,'"" the suit read.  According to the suit, which was dismissed earlier this year, CredEarn was initially supposed to be called ""UpholdEarn"" but was renamed to avoid regulatory risk.  ""Uphold knew that Cred was implementing a highly risky hedging strategy, and that there was regulatory risk associated with cryptocurrency yield earning programs,"" read the suit. ""Rather than take on all of these risks, Uphold and Schatt decided to shift the risks away from Uphold by running ['Earn'] through Cred.""  Uphold denied the claims in the lawsuit and said Schatt was removed from its board involuntarily. Although the lawsuit from Cred's Liquidation Trust was dismissed (that dismissal was upheld on appeal), an additional class action suit from Cred's creditors against Uphold is still pending.

Vinnik was an operator of BTC-e between 2011 and 2017, the DOJ said, and the exchange processed more than 1 million users transacting over $9 billion in crypto during that time.  BTC-e was linked to the hack of now-defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox after it was used to launder some 300,000 {{BTC}} from Mt. Gox. BTC-e was shut down in July 2017, at the same time Vinnik was first arrested.  While Vinnik was arrested in Greece, he faced a lengthy extradition process, with U.S. and Russian and French authorities trying to convince Greece to send him to their respective nations. France did secure Vinnik's extradition and sentenced him to five years in prison, before Vinnik was sent back to Greece before eventually being extradited to the U.S. He initially denied he was an operator of BTC-e, saying he was only an employee at the exchange.  BTC-e did not register as a money services business in the U.S., did not operate any know-your-customer or anti-money laundering rules and did not collect any customer data, the DOJ said Friday. Vinnik did use shell companies to process fiat conversions for BTC-e, the DOJ added.  The press release said the exchange did receive funds from criminal activities including ransomware attacks, hacks and other schemes, and Vinnik was directly responsible for some $121 million in losses.  In a statement, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said, ""Today’s result shows how the Justice Department, working with international partners, reaches across the globe to combat cryptocrime. This guilty plea reflects the Department’s ongoing commitment to use all tools to fight money laundering, police crypto markets, and recover restitution for victims.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SPONSORED,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/03/btc-e-operator-alexander-vinnik-pleads-guilty-to-money-laundering-conspiracy-charge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b6365b21942597cf6c24f16c3d30739870f6f8b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

26808871,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606493,1714773647,"Bitcoin Price Surges Towards $61,000, Eyeing Potential Breakout To $67-$68k Range","Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, has experienced a notable resurgence in its bullish momentum, with the Bitcoin price reclaiming the crucial $61,000 threshold. This recovery follows a week-long downtrend that led to a 20% drop to $56,000 on Wednesday. As the bullish momentum returns, the possibility of further testing upper resistance levels and reclaiming previously lost price levels grows stronger. Bitcoin Bulls Eye $68,000 According to market expert Justin Bennett, a recovery of the $61,000 resistance level would open up potential areas such as $67,000 to $68,000. However, at the present moment, this level continues to pose a significant resistance. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Bank Analysts Sound Warning Alarm: Bitcoin Price Can Still Drop To $50,000 Analyzing the recent correction in the Bitcoin price, analyst Crypto Con suggests that the market correction was necessary for the long-term price trajectory. The full retest of the 20-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support at $56,700 and the return to indicator support zones, such as the Directional Movement Index, indicate a healthy price consolidation. In addition to the technical indicators, on-chain and market data analytics firm CryptoQuant’s founder and CEO, Ki Young Ju, highlights the current bullish sentiment. According to their data, whales accumulated a significant amount of Bitcoin, totaling 47,000 BTC, within the past 24 hours. This increased accumulation by large investors further bolsters the positive outlook for Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Price Poised For Bullish Surge Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has provided further bullish predictions for the Bitcoin price, suggesting that recent corrections have resulted in the grabbing of leverage longs liquidity. In addition, the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI)on the 5-day chart is on the verge of crossing into bullish territory. This occurrence has historically been followed by an upward price movement in Bitcoin, leading to higher highs. Such a pattern has the potential to fuel renewed investor confidence and attract further buying pressure. Related Reading: Why This Crypto Bull Run Might Not Live Up To The Past: Analyst Another positive signal highlighted by Titan of Crypto is the recent buy signal generated by the Supertrend indicator, as seen in the chart below. This technical tool helps identify trends in an asset’s price movement. The buy signal, which occurred just three months ago, implies that Bitcoin may still have significant room for growth before reaching its cycle top. According to the analyst, historical data suggests that the average duration from the buy signal to the cycle top is approximately 19 months, indicating the potential for a sustained upward trend. Currently trading at $61,600, Bitcoin has seen a significant increase of 4.7% in the last 24 hours alone. It remains to be seen if BTC will successfully break above resistance levels, while also challenging the ability of previously retested support levels to withstand potential future downtrends.

In line with this, he urged Bitcoin investors to take action with a parabolic surge on the horizon. An Imminent Quantitative Easing Would Be Good For Bitcoin Van de Poppe suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin will rise on the back of a Quantitative Easing (QE), which he anticipates is “close.” He noted that the Fed has already started to “unwind Treasury buybacks and is reducing QT [Quantitative Tightening].” He claims this is happening because the economic data has worsened, which puts the US at risk of a recession. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Descending Triangle Like It Did In 2021, Analyst Sets $6 Target Therefore, the Fed seeks to avoid this recession by buying back long-term government bonds and injecting liquidity into the financial system. As the crypto expert predicts, this could be good since it will force the Fed to take a more dovish stance and possibly lower interest rates, boosting investors’ confidence to go all in on risk assets like Bitcoin. Van de Popper further predicts that this Quantitative Easing will become evident in the data released in the coming months. In line with this, he advised investors to long Bitcoin. It is worth noting that Bitcoin dropped to as low as $57,000 ahead of the latest FOMC meeting, with many investors seeming to have anticipated a hawkish stance from the Fed. However, as the crypto expert noted, the rates remain unchanged, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised the possibility of a rate cut as early as June. Given Bitcoin’s price recovery since then, this development looks to have already revived a bullish sentiment among investors. What To Expect Going Forward In another X post, Van de Popper revealed his expectations for the crypto market going forward. He stated that Bitcoin will consolidate and go sideways (possibly ahead of the QE which will boost its price in the coming months. Meanwhile, he also expects Altcoins to “heavily outperform and rotation kicks in.” Related Reading: Crypto Prediction Website Reveals When The Cardano Price Will Reach $45 The crypto expert had previously echoed a similar sentiment when he stated that he expects altcoins to bounce in their Bitcoin pairs while Bitcoin faces a period of consolidation that he doesn’t expect to change in the “coming months.” Back then, he also mentioned that there would be a narrative shift to Ethereum, and he reaffirmed this belief in a more recent X post, stating that he expects a lot from the second-largest crypto token by market cap. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $59,100, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Retracement From $73,800 Is Deeper And Took Longer To Form","Some analysts were frightened by the recent drop in Bitcoin prices. Though the coin is showing signs of strength, multiple leveraged longs were liquidated early this week. In a post on X, one analyst thinks Bitcoin might have just found support, bottoming up after the contraction this week, pushing it lower from the multi-week range established in mid-March through to the better part of April. Bitcoin Retracement Is Deeper And Took Longer: Bottom In? Expressing confidence, the analyst cited a historical pattern. Based on a price action assessment in the weekly chart, the analyst notes that whenever Bitcoin posts a deep retracement, there is usually a higher probability of the coin bottoming up and shaking off weakness. Related Reading: Bitcoin Update: $120 Million Futures Liquidated As Price Takes A Beating At the same time, prices tend to recover after a retracement that takes longer than expected. Building on their historical pattern observation, the analyst applied it to the current BTC situation. The trader said up to the current level, the retracement from an all-time high is deeper and also took longer than usual, spanning several weeks. As a result, the analyst projected a high likelihood that Bitcoin prices might have found a bottom. While confidence abounds, it is still challenging to pick bottoms. Bitcoin and crypto assets are volatile, with prices moving quickly in either direction. At spot rates, Bitcoin is trading above $60,000, reversing losses of May 1. Even though this might cement the analyst’s position, BTC remains within a bear breakout formation, defined by the wide-ranging, high-volume bear bar of April 30. Moreover, the coin is still boxed away from the April trade range, suggesting that weakness remains. Should there be a conclusive close above $62,000, the trend will likely shift in favor of bulls, reversing the losses of April 30. Related Reading: Why This Crypto Bull Run Might Not Live Up To The Past: Analyst Before then, aggressive traders might be unloading at higher prices, aligning with the current bearish formation. Market Forces Will Shape BTC Prices Despite the bearish outlook, most analysts are bullish, expecting a sharp price recovery. One of them took to X, suggesting that buyers will likely take charge if prices recover from spot rates and return to the horizontal range of March to April. The pace and direction at which prices move going forward lean on market factors. So far, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers are decreasing their holdings. At the same time, the United States Federal Reserve is tracking inflation and other metrics as they tune monetary policy. If inflation drops, the USD will likely strengthen, heaping more pressure on the world’s most valuable crypto.

The annualized cost to roll Bitcoin Futures decreased 31% to 15%, indicating a significant reduction in market leverage and bullish sentiment post-halving. Miners' daily revenues slightly declined by 5% to $61.9 million but remain extraordinarily high historically in the 99th percentile, thanks to the elevated Bitcoin prices and transaction fees. April's on-chain, post-halving Bitcoin snapshot: Minor revenue dip for miners, rising transaction fees, slight price decline with strong year-over-year growth. In our April 2024 Bitcoin ChainCheck, we analyze the shifts occurring after the April 19 halving. We're beginning to observe key metrics that highlight the resilience and evolving dynamics of the Bitcoin blockchain. Some takeaways for April 2024: Bitcoin’s Price Action Market sentiment: The immediate aftermath of the bitcoin halving has seen a slight dip in price by 2% over the last 30 days, settling at $66,472. Despite this short-term pullback, the year-over-year increase stands at an impressive 130%. Regional trading: Post-halving adjustments have brought distinct changes in regional market behaviors: Asia hours: Prices dipped by 7% month-over-month, showing market caution in Asian trading sessions. Let’s see if the new Hong Kong spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs reverse this trend. Unlike Asia, U.S. trading hours saw a 4% increase, indicating stronger confidence or possible accumulation phases during these hours. EU hours: European trading showed modest growth with a 1% increase, reflecting steady but cautious participation. MoM Change (%) YoY Change (%) Asia Hours Price Change MoM ($) -7% 19% U.S. hours Price Change 4% 56% EU hours Price Change 1% 35% Source: Glassnode, as of 4/28/24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Funding rates : The annualized cost to roll Bitcoin Futures decreased 31% to 15%, indicating a significant reduction in market leverage and bullish sentiment post-halving. Bitcoin’s Network Activity, Adoption, and Fees Daily transactions: Transaction count surged by 27% this month, a robust rebound that puts the heightened network usage post-halving in the 97th percentile of all-time activity. Ordinal inscriptions: Post-halving adjustments saw a sharp 60% decrease in daily inscriptions, landing in the 30th percentile historically. This significant reduction may reflect a shift in priorities or valuation of Ordinals after the release of ""Runes,” a new fungible token protocol recently launched on the Bitcoin blockchain. Unlike Ordinals, which inscribe unique data onto individual Satoshis creating NFTs, Runes utilize the existing UTXO model to issue fungible tokens with minimal blockchain impact. This could explain why the drop in inscriptions hasn't captured any growth from Runes, as they fundamentally differ in their blockchain usage and purpose. Despite Runes’ minimal impact on data load, their transactions still accrue fees, contributing to the high transaction fees observed this month. Runes, focusing on fungibility, offer streamlined integration with Bitcoin's infrastructure, potentially setting a new direction for token usage on the network. However, it's important to note that despite the robust monthly averages for transaction fees, we observed a significant decline in these fees at the end of the month, indicating a possible easing of network congestion. Total transfer volume: Despite a 26% month-over-month decrease, the $51.16 billion transferred across the Bitcoin network keeps it in the 87th percentile for historical activity. This indicates the enduring use of Bitcoin for value transfers amidst broader market adjustments. Average transaction fees: With the increase in network activity, average transaction fees in USD soared by 126%, reaching an average of $16.77. This uptick places the current fee structure in the 95th percentile historically, reflecting the higher cost of transacting on an increasingly busy network. Bitcoin Market Health and Profitability Percent of addresses in profit : 94% of Bitcoin addresses remain in profit despite a slight decline of 4% over the month. We have noted before that when this figure hits 100%, as it did in March, Bitcoin tends to make repeated all-time highs over the subsequent year, albeit with a frequent 20% corrections. Net unrealized profit/loss: The unrealized profit/loss ratio is 0.58, indicating a healthy but not overly euphoric market sentiment. Bitcoin Miners Total daily BTC miner revenues : Miners' daily revenues slightly declined by 5% to $61.9 million but remain extraordinarily high historically in the 99th percentile, thanks to the elevated Bitcoin prices and transaction fees.

42418310,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTdBwD,1714765115,Full Transcript: Why MoonPay and PayPal Partnered to Expand Crypto Adoption in the U.S.,"CoinDesk's Jennifer Sanasie interviewed MoonPay co-founder and CEO Ivan Soto-Wright for CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" on May 3, to discuss MoonPay's recent partnership with PayPal. Here is the full transcript of the interview.  Jennifer Sanasie: MoonPay users can now buy crypto via PayPal (PYPL). The new partnership means that users in the US can seamlessly purchase crypto with PayPal through wallet transfers, bank transfers and debit card transactions. Now the cryptocurrency buying app is the first company to do this with PayPal. CEO and co founder Ivan Soto Wright says that the partnership will help the company reach more customers. So how is this going to enable mainstream adoption? We explore that now. Ivan Soto-Wright, welcome to First Mover.  Ivan Soto-Wright: Awesome, thanks for having me.  Jennifer Sanasie: Thanks for being here. Now this partnership was announced this week. Let's start at the basics, lay a foundation for me. How's this gonna work?  Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, so at MoonPay, we're trying to onboard the world to crypto. And so for us, we're constantly looking at new payment methods, new geographies we can expand into. And for us, PayPal was a natural fit. 426 million customers that are inside of PayPal can now use their balances, their debit cards that are saved on the platform, and frictionlessly use PayPal inside of MoonPay to top up their favorite wallet.  Jennifer Sanasie: Now, I gotta ask you, I gotta play the devil's advocate here and I'm doing it because people ask me this all the time. Does the world wanna be onboarded onto crypto? Talk to me about some of your user stories and the future that you envision.  Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, well, I think the future of money is definitely cryptocurrency. I think that eventually we're going to see a place very similar to what we've seen with the Internet. So the Internet really brought down the cost of communication. We're now using voiceover to intero and a protocol to communicate. The same thing will happen for money instead of, you know, all these legacy infrastructure systems that don't communicate on the same language. We can now move to a system built on Internet built by blockchain where transaction costs, I think, will eventually tend towards zero. We're in the early phases of that. It's kind of like the dial-up days. We're constantly getting faster. We're getting speedier. We're going to reduce those cost of transactions. But our job is really just to lower the barriers to enable people to participate.  Jennifer Sanasie: How many years do you think it's gonna be until we hit that adoption, until we go from dial-up days to 5G?  Ivan Soto-Wright: I mean, it's already really impressive some of the innovation that you've seen on some of these Ethereum blockchains, these layer two solutions. We've already gotten to a place of optimism where transaction costs and gas fees are near zero. And we also have new layer one blockchains that are coming to the market. You know, we don't take a particular take on one blockchain that's going to succeed. We have a view that there's going to be multiple blockchains. And really it's around what are the use cases and the performance that we see as a result of the technology.  Jennifer Sanasie: So you're not gonna give me any years, no predictions, no looking into the crystal ball.  Ivan Soto-Wright: I think it's followed a very similar trend to the internet. I would never have imagined that MoonPay now has 20 million customers on the platform. It's only been five years since we started the business. I still think we're early days in terms of the overall cycle. I look at market cap somewhat as a proxy. If we look at the Bitcoin market cap today, gold at 12 trillion, Bitcoin around a trillion, we still have a long way to go in terms of adoption of this asset class.  Jennifer Sanasie: Let's talk about those 20 million customers. I know that there's a story on coindesk.com. You spoke to us for the launch of this yesterday and you outlined some challenges that customers had, particularly when they were trying to get fiat onto the platform via things like bank cards. Tell me a little bit more about those issues.  Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, unfortunately, you know, it really pains me as the co -founder of the service. One of our biggest complaints that we receive is sometimes people try to use their card and they have that card rejected by their bank. Now we can't really do much about that. Some banks will decide to decline transactions related to crypto. You know, I think what we see is we want to get to a place where we have the same user experience that we have in traditional fintech. So how do we get there? We partner with traditional fintech and PayPal. Used by over 426 million people. It's a seamless way that people have used to pay. We're now forming a partnership with legacy, some of the bigger fintech platforms to enable that same user experience inside this cryptic ecosystem.  Jennifer Sanasie: Have you attempted to form partnerships with any of the banks or have conversations with the banks about this? I know it's not just a MoonPay problem, it's a problem for almost every platform that allows people to buy and trade crypto in the United States and Canada where I'm from, but have you had any conversations with the banks?  Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, I mean, we're in constant contact with pretty much everyone in this industry. We're always thinking on behalf of our users, how do we provide a better experience? Some banks have updated their policies, some banks haven't. So it just comes down to their appetite. Kind of similar to what you're seeing in the ETF world. There's obviously some players that have decided to not participate full stop. There's others that are really leaning into it like BlackRock. So I think a very similar thing has taken place with banks and their...willingness to work inside this industry. I think for them, the challenge is there are some risks when it comes to cryptocurrency. When you deliver cryptocurrency over a blockchain, it's final. So there's no way to reverse that transaction. And so you do have a potential increased risk for fraud. A lot of the work that we do at MoonPay is to really build the best fraud models to determine should we accept or reject this particular customer and try to de -risk that as much as possible. So we try to do our part. Because we do think this technology is the future and we think that over time that appetite will change. We think that more banks will recognize that this is an important industry to be part of and we'll need tooling like MoonPay.  Jennifer Sanasie: You mentioned 20 million customers. Talk to me about how active they are these days. And the reason I ask you that is because it felt like we were going to have an epic year in crypto in January when the ETFs were approved. And now it's feeling a little bit weird if we look at some of what's going on from a macro perspective. The price of Bitcoin is down. There are net outflows with the ETFs now. Talk to me about your user base. Are you seeing an influx of new users? How active are they?  Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, we actually saw a 43% increase in activity over the last quarter. So we had our best quarter in our five -year history in Q1 this year. And that's given the backdrop of very high interest rates. Most people thought that if interest rates were going to persist at these levels, crypto was not going to be a thing. We've actually kind of seen the opposite. I think a lot of our work is still just trying to improve the user experience. We really believe that if we get the user experience right, people will start to opt into these products similar to how people start to opt in to zoom and you know All these amazing applications that are built on voice over the internet protocol We think the same thing will take place for money and all these new crypto applications, but we're looking at a long period of time. So if you look at the general trend, I try not to look at trends within a year or six months. I really look at zooming out, look at the long term. It's up and to the right. There's more developers coming into the ecosystem. There's new applications that are being built. It just takes time for this ecosystem to flourish.  Jennifer Sanasie: You know, I spoke to tech journalist Kara Swisher recently, and I asked her if she thought that we were in a similar phase to the beginning of the internet. You know, she's been around, she's reported quite deeply on the beginning of the internet, and she told me no, she thinks that this sector is a sector that will be around, but maybe not as grand as us who work in the industry like to say it is. Would you agree with that sentiment, or what do you think?  Ivan Soto-Wright: I think with any new technology, there's obviously a lot of hype. You go through a hype cycle where everyone is extremely excited about all the promise and then reality sets in. And when it comes down to the reality, the reality for crypto today is the user experience is not where it needs to be. And so that's where we're very committed to our mission of making crypto more like your experience with your fintech than, you know, I think traditional crypto companies that, you know, when I started, there wasn't even graphical user interfaces for some of these wallets. Like you had to use your terminal. It's gotten markedly better and I think the experiences will continue to improve.  Jennifer Sanasie: Talk to me a little bit more about that user experience because I think everyone agrees that the user experience needs to get better and we have great web two apps with great user experiences. Where are the challenges? What are the issues facing developers when it comes to creating a good user experience? Because we know what a good user experience looks like. It just feels like we can't really get it right.  Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, well, I think from our side, it's just constant. We have this word inside of MoonPay called Kaizen, which is continuous improvement. It's these 1 % incremental improvements that you make every single day. You do that over a year, and that's a 3 ,000 % improvement. So we're constantly learning from our users. The reality is it just takes time. You have to adapt that product. You have to get that feedback. You need to listen to your customers. And obviously, trying to solve some of the biggest pain points for them. Like, it's not acceptable if you have a high decline rate because you're getting rejected by your bank. We do things like we prompt the customer based on the six digits of the card number. We could tell them, hey, you could try another payment method. Now we can tell them to try PayPal.  Jennifer Sanasie: Talk to me a little bit about the partnership with PayPal. What was that journey like? Was PayPal on board from the get -go? Did it take a little bit of convincing? What was that, I don't wanna call it the dating phase like?  Ivan Soto-Wright: Well, we've always had huge admiration for PayPal. They're a phenomenal company. They've always been an innovator. Even since the early days, I remember using PayPal on eBay. I would sell things in my garage online. That was the first time I received money. It was actually through my PayPal account. I see us as kind of building the next frontier. In the same way that you use PayPal to interact with the world of e -commerce, you can use MoonPay to interact the world of crypto and all these new applications. And so I thought it was a natural partnership. I thought that if we could improve the conversion rates for our customers, it was a no brainer. And so we've been spending a lot of time with that team and we're really impressed. They've actually really leaned into crypto. They've been proactive in trying to support more assets on their platform. They've invested heavily in their stable coin initiative, which I think has huge promise. I think we're in the early days of stable coins, but really now you can move frictionlessly money across many different geographies, cross border. They just announced a partnership with zoom. I definitely see the use case for stablecoins being quite strong. We're in the early days. We're obviously still getting to regulatory clarity in the United States around how these things should be backed. But I think ultimately they're going to be an important part of our financial system.  Jennifer Sanasie: I know you spoke to a CoinDesk reporter and said it took some time to get PayPal comfortable with the relationship. What did you mean there?  Ivan Soto-Wright: It just took time in terms of any major integration. You just have to go through a process. So it's obviously not as fast. As CEO, I want everything to happen yesterday. And so it just takes time to get these things done. But eventually, we get them done.  Jennifer Sanasie: Now you are known at MoonPay for the big mainstream partnerships, the big flashy celebrity partnerships. I know late last year there was a MasterCard partnership announced. Any progress there?  Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, so the MasterCard partnership is one of our most exciting ones. We actually did something very cool at the Arnold Palmer Golf Invitational very recently, where they're starting to look at how do they bring priceless experiences to their customers. Priceless has always been their tagline at MasterCard. And so what they did is they did a bunch of really cool activations at the event. If you scanned, you know, there was a bunch of different QR codes and NFC chips inside the actual event. And if you scan them or you interact with these NFC chips, you would gain collectibles. And some of those collectibles offered you tickets. So if you won't manage to find all these collectibles inside the actual tournament, you would get offered tickets the next day. So it's thinking, how do we provide better experiences to our customers? It's not necessarily, oh, I'm getting an asset because I believe it's going to go up in value. It's an asset that actually has utility.  Jennifer Sanasie: Any other big partnerships you can let us know about?  Ivan Soto-Wright: We'll have more very soon, but I think this PayPal one is the one that we're super concentrated at the moment. We want to make this a roaring success. We want as many of our users to take it up and actually see success with being able to onboard. It's great for us. Also, for people that have bank payment methods that they'd like to use, they can now use them through PayPal.  Jennifer Sanasie: Now, I gotta ask you, everyone who works in this industry has one sector of it that they're very excited about, one that they watch very closely, and it's not always the one that we focus on in our everyday job. Is there a sector in this industry that you're really excited about if you look beyond MoonPay and what MoonPay is doing?  Ivan Soto-Wright: I still think we're really early days around the use cases for NFTs. I'm still quite excited about the promise of NFTs. I think we're still early days in terms of how we think about programming content on the blockchain. And so I think things like tickets make a lot of sense to me. I think the ticketing industry today has a lot of inefficiencies. I think a lot of them could be solved by having a robust system that I think will be built on blockchain. I also think gaming assets, I think inside of games, a lot of people collect these digital assets, but they're constrained to the environments. They're in the same way that your money, in a lot of cases, is being held by all these third parties, your data, your property that you have inside of these games is held by third parties, you can now own and control them yourself. And I think that will be the future.  Jennifer Sanasie: You and I are excited about the same things in this industry, so great minds. I've been, yeah, of course. Thank you very much for joining me today.  Ivan Soto-Wright: Appreciate that.  Ivan Soto-Wright: Awesome.

26801781,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606359,1714762839,"Crypto Analyst Says Cardano “Ready For A Parabolic Bull Run,” Here’s Why","An analyst has explained how, if the historical pattern followed by the ADA price is to be believed, Cardano seems ready to go on a parabolic bull run. Cardano May Be Set For A Bull Run Based On Historical Trends In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed what hints history may contain regarding where ADA’s price would go next from here. First, here is a chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend the cryptocurrency followed back in 2019: The pattern that the price of the asset followed a few years back | Source: @ali_charts on X From the graph, it’s visible that the asset had first consolidated inside a parallel channel during this period. A “parallel channel” in technical analysis (TA) refers to the region bounded by two parallel trend lines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Loses Historical Level, Analyst Says “Reclaim And Bounce, Or Die” The upper line of the pattern connects the tops in the price, while the lower one joins the bottoms. When consolidating inside the channel, the price is probable to find resistance at the upper end and support at the lower one. A break out of either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. As is visible in the chart, ADA managed to break out of this past parallel channel with a 75% surge. The asset then followed this rally up with a correction of around 56% before finally lifting off into a massive 4,095% bull run. Interestingly, just like in 2019, Cardano was stuck inside a similar parallel channel in 2023. The chart below shows this recent pattern for the cryptocurrency. Looks like the price of the asset recently broke out of its parallel channel | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the graph, Cardano broke out of this latest parallel channel a while ago, this time with a rally of around 72%. Recently, though, the asset has lost this bullish momentum, as it has seen a drawdown of 50%. According to the analyst, however, this can, in fact, set the stage for a new bull run. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes! If that is the case for Cardano, we should be positioning ourselves for what’s coming, understanding that the recent price correction might just be one of the last buy-the-dip opportunities ADA will give you. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $1 Million Per BTC “Fair Value”, Analyst Says It now remains to be seen whether ADA will repeat the pattern from the last bull run or not. This is more about the long-term view, though, so where might the asset go in the short term? This may be answered by a signal that the analyst has shared in another X post. The TD Sequential signal that the ADA price has formed recently | Source: @ali_charts on X As Martinez explains: The TD Sequential, which timed the Cardano top, now presents a buy signal on the ADA daily chart. It anticipates a one to four daily candlesticks rebound that could put an end to the ADA corrective phase. ADA Price At the time of writing, Cardano is trading around $0.464, down 3% over the past week.

The analyst further provided insights into why he is particularly bullish on these altcoins. Ethereum Is Number One On The Altcoins List DonAlt mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he will buy “ETH, DOGE, LTC, and maybe PEPE” whenever he believes BTC has bottomed. In a video posted on his YouTube channel, he gave insights into why he was bullish on these crypto tokens, especially Ethereum. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Must Hold Above $51,800 As ETF Outflows Trigger Crash The crypto analyst mentioned that Ethereum is now low enough for him to be comfortable with buying. He also suggested that the crypto token was likely a good buy at this price level, stating that it is currently having a good price action (especially on the weekly chart) with Bitcoin struggling. DonAlt added that Ethereum will likely experience a good breakout as Bitcoin struggles and that its underperformance could be over soon. However, DonAlt hasn’t bought Ethereum yet. He revealed that he will bet on Ethereum if Bitcoin reclaims $62,000. The analyst further suggested that Bitcoin reclaiming this level would determine whether or not the bottom was in. To support his stance, he noted that many altcoins are struggling to hold their support levels due to Bitcoin’s breakdown. However, if Bitcoin were to reclaim $62,000, the rest of the market would likely pick up, too. Meanwhile, DonAlt remarked that Ethereum could move to $4,000 if it manages to close above $3,000 on its weekly chart. He further stated that this is the most bullish he has been on the second-largest crypto token in years. Why Dogecoin (DOGE) And Pepe (PEPE) DonAlt didn’t give an exact reason why he was looking to buy Litecoin other than the fact that it is an old coin. However, he gave insights into why he was bullish on the other two altcoins, Dogecoin and Pepe. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Descending Triangle Like It Did In 2021, Analyst Sets $6 Target According to him, the foremost meme coin is still likely to reach $1 if Bitcoin hasn’t topped out, which presents an opportunity to make a lot of money. Interestingly, he had previously claimed that Dogecoin was a better investment than Bitcoin. He also revealed that he is waiting for Dogecoin to drop to around $0.11 before buying, although he is still comfortable with buying around $0.15 if it doesn’t. Meanwhile, as to why he is bullish on Pepe, he suggested that the meme coin was a good buy because of its recent performance. He went as far as comparing it to Dogwifhat (WIF) and claimed that he would pick Pepe over it because Pepe is on a “non-joke-like chain” (Ethereum), unlike WIF, which is a “meme on a meme chain” (Solana).

42418303,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTdBr3,1714757210,"The Dollar Won, but Might the U.S. Lose Control of the Dollar?","The dominance of the U.S. dollar is hard to overstate at the moment. It’s not just that the U.S. economy is on a roll. The U.S. dollar is the preferred choice for international business transactions at a level that’s even larger than the U.S. economic position.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  To put these two in perspective, the U.S. economy represents about 25% of global output – a level that has been stable for over 40 years (an astonishing achievement when you consider the rapid growth achieved in China, parts of Asia, and Eastern Europe). When it comes to global finance, though, the dollar is even more dominant than the U.S. economy.  The Bank of International Settlements estimates that the U.S. dollar is used in 90% of all international payments and settlements, with 40% of all trade invoiced in U.S. dollars. In the world of blockchain stablecoins, the U.S. dollar represents 99% of all global stablecoin transactions. (USDT and USDC, the leading players, are both USD-backed and based on Ethereum.)  All these U.S. dollar transactions put much of the world’s financial infrastructure within reach of U.S. regulators. Most of these U.S. dollars are electronic and consequently they all have ties back to U.S. banks and, in turn, eventually, U.S. regulators and the U.S. Federal Reserve. The extra-territorial nature of U.S. law and the reach of U.S. institutions and digital networks makes it very difficult to transact in dollars without encountering U.S. regulations.  There’s always cash, but the largest bill printed by the U.S. Treasury today is $100. That will get you dinner in New York, for one (no wine). Imagine how many of them you’ll need to cover the cost of that new aircraft carrier. For any substantial funding requirements, you need digital payments.  This dollar dominance gives the U.S. considerable power in the global markets, especially when it comes to sanctions against individuals and governments. Banks, wary of being cut off from 90% of all global payments, are going to follow U.S. directives whether they are binding or not.  Other countries have tried to supplant the dollar, largely without success. There is, however, a new option that exists: synthetic dollars on a blockchain.  Synthetic dollars are dollar-denominated stable coins that contain no dollars. Instead, they are digital tokens that are pegged to the U.S. dollar in value but backed by a mix of other real and digital assets and managed by an algorithm to maintain a peg with the U.S. dollar. In the world of blockchain, they are known as algorithmic stablecoins.  Algorithmic stablecoins aren’t perfect and they aren’t risk free. Because they are dollar-denominated but often don’t consist of dollars, they can “lose their peg” with the U.S. dollar. Sometimes this happens because of fraud, but it can also happen when the underlying assets change rapidly in value. In periods of high market turmoil and uncertainty, this happens.  Synthetic dollars, in effect, can cost more than “real” dollars because you need to over-capitalize your collateral in order to avoid the risk of losing that alignment with the U.S. dollar. Despite these risks, quite a few blockchain-based digital assets have been established with a peg to the U.S. dollar. The dai, from MakerDAO, is probably the most successful of these, though its backing today includes some U.S. dollar assets. There are others, however, that are pegged purely based on cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that do not connect with the dollar.  See also: Crypto's Transition: Bringing Capital Onshore | Opinion  Widespread availability of these assets could alter the regulatory landscape for individuals, companies, and governments – allowing them to transact in the world’s standard currency of choice while remaining outside the U.S. regulatory structure. This would be particularly useful when those people want to move money across borders or buy goods that are globally priced in U.S. dollars, such as oil.  Not everyone really wants a synthetic stablecoin. Their share of the market is relatively small compared to stablecoins that are wholly or partially backed with U.S.-dollar-denominated assets. When it comes to risk and cost, a U.S. dollar stablecoin that is backed with U.S. dollars or U.S. -dollar-denominated assets like U.S. Treasury bonds̅ by far the lowest risk option. It’s clear that many users prefer this to other choices for that reason.  The implications for U.S. policy are significant. Widespread adoption of these assets could diminish the power of sanctions and the reach of U.S. regulatory structures. To head off that risk, perhaps the simplest strategy for the U.S. is to speed up the approval and regulatory integration of existing U.S.-dollar-backed stablecoins.  The U.S. dollar is more than just a currency; it’s a strategic asset for the United States and a global symbol of our national resiliency and economic power.

Investors Hit Hard As FRIEND Token Crashes Upon its debut, the FRIEND token entered the market with a trading price of $169 per token, attracting 18,000 holders, and boasting a circulating supply of 14 million tokens. However, the current trading price has plummeted to approximately $1.26, resulting in a market cap of $27.7 million and liquidity of $5.4 million, according to DexScreener data, leaving many investors frustrated. Related Reading: Why This Crypto Bull Run Might Not Live Up To The Past: Analyst The airdrop process, which aimed to distribute tokens to the community, has faced its fair share of challenges. Users on social media site X (formerly Twitter) expressed frustration over the declining value of their airdropped tokens.

One user even accused a prominent figure of orchestrating a rug pull, further fueling the community’s discontent.

Notably, crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades suggests that the token’s value may rise in the future, emphasizing that market sentiment may change once users start to see returns on their investments. However, concerns remain regarding the functionality of the Friend.tech app, which experienced significant issues during its initial weeks. DeFi researcher DeFi Ignas expressed disappointment in Friend.tech’s V2 launch, describing it as a “massive flop.” Ignas criticized the app’s usability issues and questioned whether the team’s focus was misplaced during development. Speculation arose regarding whether the team deliberately orchestrated a price decline to prompt a subsequent surge in value.

The dovish Fed meeting results mean the U.S. dollar's surge likely topped, helping cryptocurrencies, Coinbase analysts said.  Cryptocurrencies bounced on Friday led by bitcoin's {{BTC}} gain, sparking hopes that the worst of the drawdown might be over.  BTC surged almost 5% to briefly above $62,000 during U.S. morning hours following a cooler-than-expected U.S. April jobs report that eased concerns about higher interest rates. At press time bitcoin was changing hands at $61,600, up 4.4% and outperforming the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index's (CD20) 3% advance over the past 24 hours.  Ether {{ETH}} reclaimed the $3,000 level and was up 3% during the same period, while altcoin majors dogecoin {{DOGE}}, shiba inu {{SHIB}} and Near Protocol's NEAR jumped 5%-10%.  The rally happened as the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, less than the analyst consensus of 245,000 and the previous month's 315,000, according to the government's Nonfarm Payrolls report. It also showed the unemployment rate inching higher to 3.9% from 3.8% in March.  Following the report, market participants saw a 68% odds for at least one rate cut by September, up from 57% a week ago, CME FedWatch data indicated.  Read more: Bitcoin’s Recent Weakness Is More Tied to Global Markets Than to Anything Crypto Specific, Coinbase Says  Bitcoin's correction since mid-March coincided with mounting concerns of the Federal Reserve policymakers adopting a more hawkish stance in face of sticky inflation in recent months, with some traders even dismissing chances of any rate cut this year. That's helped the U.S. dollar index to its highest level since November, often a bearish signal for risk assets like crypto.  In addition to the soft jobs data, Coinbase analysts David Han and David Duong took note of this week's FOMC meeting at which policymakers indicated no interest in cutting rates, but did taper the pace of the central bank's balance sheet runoff – often referred to as quantitative tightening (QT) campaign – as a dovish sign.  ""We believe that the FOMC’s more dovish-than-expected statement has signaled the peak in the USD’s upward momentum against both FX [foreign currencies] and crypto pairs,"" Han and Duong wrote.  Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, said in his latest essay early Friday that bitcoin has likely bottomed at this week's lows of $56,000, but warned investors to expect a gradual climb instead of a swift recovery to the March highs as markets will cool for the next few months. ""Did bitcoin hit a local low [...] earlier this week,"" asked Hayes. ""Yes,"" he concluded. ""I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher.""  Speaking about what's next, he forecasted ""a rally to above $60,000 and then range-bound price action between $60,000 and $70,000 until August.""",POSITIVE,BTC | SHIB | NEAR,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SHIB | NEAR,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/03/bitcoin-hits-62k-as-cryptos-bounce-correction-likely-over-but-expect-a-slow-grind-higher-arthur-hayes-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8acea2e95d345d990c71a7eceb43b6cae87d9b82-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

26794677,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606467,1714752057,Analyst Discusses Bitcoin Price Path To Heighten Fear Factor,"MilkyBull, a well-known personality in the world of cryptocurrency analysis, has drawn attention lately for his analysis of Bitcoin’s price trajectory and his prediction of a situation that might cause more fear in the market. MilkyBull’s analysis delves into the subtleties of Bitcoin’s movement, identifying patterns and trends that could have a big impact on investor mood. Bitcoin Triggering Anxiety In The Market According to the analyst, the market will get even more fearful of the Bitcoin price path before it bottoms out and continues to rise. The analyst claimed that because of the current price of BTC, Blackrock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw its first-ever outflows since the approval of the Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Related Reading: Bitcoin Euphoria Cools Off As BTC Distribution Enters Fear Zone Furthermore, he reminded us that positive news always denotes the peak of a Bitcoin bull cycle, while negative news denotes the bottom. With this notion, investors could position themselves for the next trajectory BTC takes. To further explore his narrative, MilkyBull drew attention to a previous analysis regarding Bitcoin’s final local bottom in this cycle. Given that BTC is following the PA (Price Action) of 2017, MilkyBull believes that the crypto asset might have bottomed out or come close to it. Historically, the bull market support band strongly sustains the Bitcoin market in bull cycles. As a result, the analyst is confident that Bitcoin’s price may wick through the support and recover. Another aspect highlighted by the expert is the Global liquidity during past bull cycles. Presently, Global liquidity is closely linked to Bitcoin at a level where it recovered in October 2022 and October 2023, which led to the inception of a massive surge in the digital assets markets, sparking a massive surge in the whole cryptocurrency market. With the macro volatility on Tuesday, MilkyBull stated that Bitcoin is at a pivotal juncture for the last local bottom before it resumes its rise to the cycle peak. Though the market does not always respond to such expectations, the majority of members in the crypto space are requesting a correction to $48,000. BTC Poised For A Breakout On The Upside Another crypto analyst Captain Faibik has also spotted the largest cryptocurrency asset undergoing a price recovery lately. According to the expert, although BTC is currently seeing a rebound, it is still moving inside the falling wedge formation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Loses Historical Level, Analyst Says “Reclaim And Bounce, Or Die” Thus, Bitcoin’s bullish investors must overcome the $61,000 resistance level for the digital asset to break out from this formation. Should BTC break out from this formation successfully, Captain Faibik anticipates a notable move on the upside toward $78,000. Given that BTC is already trading above $61,000, all eyes are now set on the $78,000 price level. At the time of writing, BTC was situated at $61,701, indicating a rise of over 5% in the past day. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that its market cap has increased by 5%, while the trading volume is down by 21%.

Bitcoin Could Plummet To $50,000 As of writing the price of Bitcoin is trading above $59,000, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has been experiencing massive price drops after the Bitcoin halving on April 20, 2024, further exacerbated by the Federal Reserve’s (FED) decision to keep interest rates unchanged during the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting On Wednesday, May 1. Related Reading: Crypto Prediction Website Reveals When The Cardano Price Will Reach $45 Standard Chartered bank has cautioned investors of more price drops in the future, predicting that Bitcoin’s price could settle between $50,000 and $52,000, recording more than $20,000 loss from it’s all time high of over $73,000 in March, 2024. This new forecast follows the bank’s previous projection which anticipated Bitcoin rise to $150,000 by the end of 2024. The head of Standard Chatered’s forex and digital assets research, Geoffery Kendrick revealed a combination of factors that could drive Bitcoin’s decline in a statement to The Block on Wednesday. Kendrick highlighted broader macroeconomic influences and crypto-specific factors impacting the price of Bitcoin, particularly challenges like the reduction of liquidity measures within the United States since mid-April. “Liquidity matters when it matters, but with a backdrop of strong US inflation data and less likelihood of Fed rate cuts, it matters at the moment,” Kendrick stated. Standard Chartered also cited the series of massive outflows witnessed by Spot Bitcoin ETfs in the US, as well as the lackluster performance of Ethereum Spot ETFs in Hong Kong, China. On May 1, approximately 10 US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded staggering outflows, collectively totaling $563.7 million. Kendrick also disclosed that “more than half of the Spot ETF positions are underwater.” He suggests that the risk of liquidity should be considered, especially as investor sentiment may be shifting away from these digital assets. BTC Price Jumps Over $1,000 Amidst Market Downturn At some point on May 2, Bitcoin had witnessed significant price decreases that pushed its value below $58,000. However, currently the cryptocurrency has recorded more than 1.56% increase, spiking by more than $1,000 in just a day.

42418299,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTdBnx,1714746635,"Bitcoin’s Recent Weakness Is More Tied to Global Markets Than to Anything Crypto Specific, Coinbase Says","Both equities and gold have fallen along with bitcoin, the report noted.  Coinbase said bitcoin’s recent pullback was below its historical range.  The cryptocurrency’s price discovery still remains rooted in global demand trends, the note said.  Bitcoin’s {{BTC}} recent weakness has not been isolated to crypto markets and therefore is not indicative of sector-specific capitulation, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report Friday.  Coinbase notes that both equities and gold have been trading lower since reaching highs in mid-April, against the backdrop of a strengthening dollar. The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell 16% in April, in the biggest monthly decline since June 2022.  “What leaves us optimistic in this pullback is that BTC’s maximum drawdown from peak is at 23%, below its historical range,” analysts David Han and David Duong wrote.  “We believe that this trend of overall reduced drawdowns will persist, in part because of the legitimization of BTC as a macro asset,” the authors wrote. This has been reinforced by spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., Canada and Europe and also by the recently launched ETFs in Hong Kong and new applications in Australia.  While inflows of overseas ETFs may not be as large as those seen in the U.S., “we think they represent an important signal for regulatory engagement with the asset class globally,” the report said.  Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot bitcoin ETF, ended its 70-day inflow streak on Wednesday and saw its first-ever outflow, the report noted. “While this indicates a slowdown of capital inflows to the asset class via the ETF product, we think that ETF flows only drive a portion of BTC price discovery given the global and deeply liquid markets on centralized exchanges (CEXs).”  “The average weekday spot volume on CEXs during 1Q24 was $18.8 billion, more than eight-fold the $2.3 billion daily volume of U.S. spot ETFs over the same period,” the note said. “This discrepancy in activity leads us to believe that bitcoin’s price discovery still remains rooted in global demand trends.”  The problem with looking at U.S. ETF inflows as a proxy for global price discovery is most obvious with gold, Coinbase said. The largest gold ETF in the U.S., SPDR Gold Shares, has had a net outflow of $3 billion in 2024 even as the precious metal has risen 12% year-to-date.

26788546,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606396,1714743059,Why This Crypto Bull Run Might Not Live Up To The Past: Analyst,"In a detailed analysis shared with his 788,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), renowned analyst Pentoshi has forecasted a more restrained outlook for the current crypto bull run, suggesting that it may not mirror the explosive growth seen in previous cycles. His insights provide a deep dive into the underlying factors that could temper the market’s performance. Why Crypto Investors Have To Expect Diminishing Returns Pentoshi began his analysis by stating, “This cycle should have the largest diminishing returns of any cycle,” attributing this prediction to several key market conditions. Primarily, he noted that the base market capitalization for cryptocurrencies has increased significantly in each successive cycle, setting a higher starting point that makes further exponential growth increasingly challenging. “Each cycle has set a floor about 10x the previous lows in terms of market cap,” Pentoshi explained. He provided a historical context, recounting that when he entered the crypto market in 2017, the market cap for altcoins was only around $12-15 billion, a figure that ballooned to over $1 trillion during peak periods. He argued, “That growth isn’t repeatable,” pointing out that the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which was then nascent, played a significant role in driving previous cycles’ exceptional returns. Related Reading: Buy Crypto In May, Go Away: Arthur Hayes Shares His Top Altcoin Picks Another significant factor Pentoshi highlighted is the dramatic increase in the number of altcoins and the corresponding market dilution. “Today, however, there are a lot more alts, and a lot more dilution,” he remarked, indicating that the proliferation of new tokens spreads investment thinner across the market, reducing the potential for individual tokens to achieve substantial price increases. Pentoshi also touched upon the demographic shifts in crypto ownership. He contrasted the early days of crypto adoption, when approximately 2% of Americans were involved in the market, to the present, where over 25% of Americans have some form of crypto investment. “It just requires more capital to move the markets, and there will continue to be a lot more alts, spreading it out further,” he noted, emphasizing the logistical and financial challenges of replicating past growth rates in a much more saturated market. An often-overlooked aspect of market dynamics, according to Pentoshi, is the role of token liquidity and its impact on price stability. He detailed that recently, tokens amounting to about $250 million were unlocked daily, though not necessarily sold. “Assuming they all got sold, that is the inflows you’d need just to keep prices stable for 24 hours,” he explained, highlighting the delicate balance required to maintain current market levels, let alone drive prices upward. Related Reading: Crypto Prediction Website Reveals When The Cardano Price Will Reach $45 Looking forward, Pentoshi was conservative in his expectations for the Total3 index, which tracks the top 125 altcoins (excludes Bitcoin and Ethereum). He estimated, “My best guess is that this cycle we don’t see Total 3 go 2x past the 21′ cycle ATH. So 2.2T max for Total3.” This projection underscores his broader thesis that while the market continues to offer daily opportunities, the era of “easy, outsized gains” might be behind us. Pentoshi concluded his analysis with advice for investors, suggesting a more cautious approach to market participation. “If you believe the cycle is 50% over, you should be taking out more than you are putting in and building up some cash and buying other assets with lower risk in the meantime,” he advised, stressing the importance of securing gains and diversifying holdings to mitigate risk. Reflecting on the psychological aspects of investing, he added, “Most people never really learn. Because if you can’t control your greed, and defeat it, you are destined to give back your gains repeatedly.” His parting words were a reminder of the cyclical and often predatory nature of financial markets, urging investors to secure profits and protect themselves from foreseeable downturns. At press time, TOTAL3 stood at $635.565 billion, which is still more than -43 % below the last cycle high.

That number stands against economist forecasts for 243,000 jobs and March's 315,000 (which was revised from a previously reported 303,000).  The unemployment rate for April was 3.9% versus forecasts for 3.8% and March's 3.8%.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} jumped more than 1% to $60,100 in the minutes following the news.  Interest rates and the U.S. dollar have both risen strongly in 2024, particularly over the past few weeks, as market expectations of a slowing in economic growth and inflation have failed to pan out. Four months ago, a series of five or six 2024 interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve had been priced into forward markets, but, prior today, that was whittled down to one or two, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  In fact, interest rate hikes have begun to enter the chat. At his post-FOMC press conference Wednesday afternoon, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was asked more than once if the central bank was mulling the idea that rates needed to be ratcheted higher. Powell poured cold water over the idea, but continued strong job growth and perky inflation might force the Fed's hand at some point.  That tighter than anticipated monetary policy is surely among the array of factors have led bitcoin to tumble roughly 20% from its all-time high reached in mid-March, but this morning's report suggests a change a possible change in trend and prices are bouncing.  Traditional markets are also taking the news well. U.S. stock index futures are now all higher by more than 1% and the 10-year Treasury yield has tumbled 11 basis points to 4.47%. The dollar index has fallen 0.8% and the price of gold has risen 0.8% to $2,329 per ounce.  A check of other report details shows some weakness as well, with average hourly earnings in April up 0.2% against forecasts for 0.3% and March's 0.3%. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings rose 3.9% versus forecasts for 4% and March's 4.1%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/03/us-april-job-additions-of-175k-miss-forecasts-for-243k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bd7d25adab19bae569a11ac843bb6b058835c49-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418315,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTdC3R,1714738002,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Hovers Around $59K to End Week,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin tested a return to $60,000 during the Asian morning on Friday before retreating to trade around $59,000. BTC has gained about 2% in the last 24 hours as it continues its recovery from a midweek rout that saw it sink below $57,000 following a drop of 16% in April, the worst month since June 2022. JPMorgan said in a report yesterday that retail investors played a bigger part in the sell-off than institutional investors. The bank is opting for a cautious stance on crypto markets in the near term due to a lack of positive catalysts. The wider crypto market has risen 1.7% in 24 hours as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20).  Coinbase had a blowout first quarter thanks to improving crypto market conditions and business diversification such as its layer-2 blockchain Base, broker JMP said in a report today. Coinbase reported income of $1.2 billion and diluted EPS of $4.40. JMP reiterated its outperform rating for COIN and a $320 price target. Canaccord Genuity raised its target from $240 to $280, while KBW lifted it to $280 from $240. “While we believe investors must remain level-headed around the ebbs and flows of enthusiasm into the industry, which often coincide with fluctuations in price, we see a number of underlying trends supporting our positive thesis that Coinbase will be a relevant player in virtually all aspects of the crypto economy,” JMP analysts led by Devin Ryan wrote.  Friend.Tech's native token tanked to $2.50 having risen as high as $169 immediately following its debut. Decentralized social platform Friend.Tech airdropped FRIEND on Friday while unveiling version 2 of the platform. ""It looks like the price dump has been driven by liquidity issues,"" Hitesh Malviya, founder of crypto analytics platform DYOR, told CoinDesk. Several users also seemed to have issues claiming their airdrop. Malviya said the distribution was a ""concentrated airdrop,"" in which leading creators took the most supply. Following its launch in August last year, assets locked in Friend.Tech reached as high as $52 million in October, but are now more than 40% lower at $29.8 million.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the most traded bitcoin options on the crypto exchange Deribit in the past 24 hours.  High volume in bitcoin calls at $90,000 and $100,000 strikes expiring in September suggests market participations maintain a bullish outlook on the cryptocurrency.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.

42418313,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTdBzJ,1714736541,UK Local Elections Show Swing to Labour With General Election Pending,"With results in from about a third of the local councils holding votes, the Labour Party has gained 116 seats, while the governing Conservatives have lost 275.  The local election results show how sentiment has changed in the run-up to a general election that must be held by the end of January.  Early results from yesterday's U.K. local elections show a swing away from the governing Conservative Party, which has staked out a pro-crypto stance, toward the Labour Party that, while it's expressed support for tokenization, has yet to say where it stands on cryptocurrencies in general.  About a third of the country's local councils went to the polls on Thursday, with more than 2,600 seats up for grabs. With results in from 70 of the 107 councils, Labour had won 722 council positions, a gain of 116, while the Conservatives lost 275 for a total of 277, BBC data shows. Many of the other results, including the London mayoral election, may not be known until tomorrow or even Sunday.  The Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, have said that they want the country to be a crypto hub and have ushered in legislation enabling crypto to be treated like a regulated financial activity while shutting down calls for it to be treated like gambling. Labour, meanwhile, has said it will support the Bank of England's digital pound plans and wants to make the country a hub for tokenization, or the representation of real-world assets on a blockchain.  These results so far suggest that the Conservatives are unlikely to hold on to power after a general election, which is likely to be held later this year and must be held by Jan. 28, 2025.

This liquidation is noteworthy, but unlike previous selloffs at the same support level, it doesn’t signal a panicked exodus from investors. Investors seem to be taking a more measured approach, suggesting a possible short-term correction rather than a long-term bear market. $BTC Futures Market Not Yet Signaling Capitulation “Given the relatively small amount of long position liquidation and the lack of dramatic negative funding ratios, we believe that a ‘capitulation’ has not yet occurred in the futures market.” – By @MAC_D46035 Link 👇… pic.twitter.com/xqArLQiITf — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 2, 2024 A Glimmer Of Hope For Long-Term Investors While the short-term outlook appears cautious, there are reasons for long-term investors to remain optimistic. On-chain metrics, which analyze data directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, offer hints of a potential future upswing. Metrics like MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) suggest there’s a chance for an upward move in the larger market cycle. This information empowers strategic investors to view the current situation as a potential buying opportunity, particularly if a significant capitulation event unfolds in the futures market. Bitcoin price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko Navigating The Bitcoin Maze: Data-Driven Decisions Are Key The current market volatility presents a complex challenge for investors. Understanding market sentiment is crucial for making informed decisions. The funding rate, an indicator of sentiment in futures contracts, has dipped into negative territory at times. BTCUSD trading at $59,167 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Traditionally, this suggests a stronger presence of bears (investors betting on a price decline) than bulls. However, the negativity hasn’t reached the extremes witnessed during past significant downturns, leaving the overall sentiment somewhat unclear. Bitcoin’s Long-Term Narrative Remains Unwritten Closely monitoring futures markets for signs of capitulation, along with analyzing other market indicators like the funding rate, is essential for success in this dynamic environment. Sharp investors armed with a strategic understanding of market dynamics are likely to profit from any future moves. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Back?

The U.S. NFP report is expected to show the pace of job creation slowed in March.  Bitcoin's price sell-off has stalled since Wednesday's Fed meeting, allowing for a minor price recovery. Further gains hinge, at least partially, on the impending U.S. nonfarm payrolls data.  The U.S. Labor Department's closely watched nonfarm payrolls report due 12:30 UTC is expected to show the world's largest economy added 243,000 jobs last month following March's 303,000 additions, according to Reuters. The unemployment rate is expected to have stayed below 4% for a 27th straight month, while average hourly earnings are forecast to have risen 0.3% month-on-month, matching March's gain.  Ahead of the data, bitcoin {{BTC}} is showing signs of stability, while the dollar index is weaker. Fed fund futures are showing renewed expectations for an interest-rate cut or liquidity easing in November.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value traded near $59,000 at press time, up over 4% from Wednesday's lows near $56,500, according to CoinDesk data. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, has declined over 1% to 105.20 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell ruled out a rate hike as the next likely move during a press conference after the Federal Open Markets Committee's decision.  Thus, the impending jobs report could be a pivotal event for markets, testing more optimistic bets on Fed rate cuts, according to ING.  ""Our 210k call for payrolls means we do not expect today’s data to dent the bearish dollar momentum as markets may fully price in a cut in September and keep short-term USD rates capped,"" ING's strategists said in a note to clients.  ""CFTC data shows net-speculative positioning on the dollar versus reported G10 currencies was at 24% of open interest, the highest since June 2019, so the room for a further long squeeze in the dollar remains substantial should U.S. data soften over the coming weeks,"" the strategists added.

42418306,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTdBt7,1714732392,Crypto Exchange Coinbase Had a Blowout First Quarter: Analysts,"Coinbase had a blowout first quarter as crypto market conditions improved, analysts said  Canaccord and KBW raised their price targets while maintaining their ratings.  Coinbase shares slipped 3.7% in premarket trading on Friday.  Coinbase (COIN) had a blowout first quarter as it benefited from improving crypto market conditions and business diversification efforts, broker JMP said in a research report on Thursday.  The crypto exchange reported first-quarter net income of $1.2 billion and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.40. Earnings included a mark-to-market gain of about $650 million on crypto assets held for investment. The world’s largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin {{BTC}}, gained more than 34% in the first quarter, while the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) rose nearly 17%.  The broker reiterated its market outperform rating and $320 price target. Canaccord Genuity raised its price target to $280 from $240 while maintaining its buy rating. KBW also raised its price target, boosting it to $240 from $230 and reiterated its market perform rating. The shares were 3.6% lower at $220.62 in early trading on Friday.  “While we believe investors must remain level-headed around the ebbs and flows of enthusiasm into the industry, which often coincide with fluctuations in price, we see a number of underlying trends supporting our positive thesis that Coinbase will be a relevant player in virtually all aspects of the crypto economy,” JMP analysts led by Devin Ryan wrote.  Several areas that JMP is most excited about for Coinbase include the introduction of its smart wallet, Coinbase Prime, and its growing international opportunity.  Consumer and institutional transaction revenue grew 101% and 133%, respectively, from the quarter before, Canaccord Genuity said in a report on Thursday.  This growth was “driven by improved broader market activity from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) alongside continued investment in product offerings and active user growth,” analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote.  The broker said it was encouraged by launch and traction around Coinbase’s layer-2 blockchain, Base. “We believe the launch of this layer 2 can help solidify COIN’s leading position by being able to drive low-cost transactions across what is a growing user/AUM base.”  Coinbase also posted strong growth balances for the USDC stablecoin, both on its platform and in total market cap, and this generated $197 million of revenue, broker KBW said in a Friday report . USDC is a stablecoin issued by Circle, which is itself backed by Coinbase. The company earns gross interest income on USDC outstanding balances.  Looking ahead, KBW said it is cautious on USDC balances due to the recent rapid growth of the business and its “assumption that balances will eventually subside once rates begin to fall, though the consensus higher-for-longer narrative has likely extended the longevity of USDC balances in the near term.”  Read more: Coinbase Offers Unique Exposure to the Long-Term Growth of Crypto: KBW",POSITIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/03/crypto-exchange-coinbase-had-a-blowout-first-quarter-analysts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/135d790015eab259f28855a4841fd66f2b1b39e0-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm is also now working with the new ETFs in Hong Kong which debuted earlier this week to rather meagre trading volume.  The CEO of CF Benchmarks, a unit of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, predicts that despite an inauspicious beginning, crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong will reach $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) by the end of 2024, Bloomberg reported on Friday.  London-based CF Benchmarks provides reference data for crypto ETFs, mostly bitcoin products including BlackRock's IBIT. Its AUM in this market totals around $24 billion and it says it represents around around half of the crypto benchmarking market.  The firm is also now working with the new ETFs in Hong Kong which debuted earlier this week to rather meagre trading volume. Despite this, CEO Sui Chung predicts that their AUM will reach $1 billion by the end of the year, the report said, citing an interview.  Chung sees South Korea and Israel as the next markets to list crypto ETFs.  ""South Korea is a market where ETFs have become the wrapper of choice for long-term savings,"" he said.  CF Benchmarks was formed in 2017 and acquired by Kraken for a nine-figure sum in 2019.  The company did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.

The token's price plummeted from as high as $169 immediately after the airdrop to $2.5.  Decentralized social platform Friend.Tech on Friday airdropped its native token, FRIEND, while unveiling version 2 of the platform, which is packed with new features, including the Money Club.  The token's price rose as high as $169 immediately after it began trading on Base before quickly collapsing to $2.5, data from DEXscreener show.  ""It looks like the price dump has been driven by liquidity issues, similar to what happened with Renzo last week,"" Hitesh Malviya, founder of crypto analytics platform DYOR, told CoinDesk. Liquidity refers to market's ability to absorb large buy and sell orders at stable prices. In a low liquidity environment, a few large orders can have an outsized impact on the market price.  Friend.Tech debuted in August last year on Coinbase's Ethereum-based layer-2 blockchain Base as an invite-only platform with a point system that rewards users for their engagement.  The new Money Club feature will facilitate an exclusive space for financial discussion and networking alongside a new point system. At press time, crypto assets worth $29.8 million were locked in Friend.Tech, more than 40% off the peak of $52.04 million in early October, according to DeFiLlama.  Activity picked up last month in anticipation of the version 2 launch, initially planned for April 20 as well the FRIEND token airdrop teased by developers.  The platform took a snapshot for the highly anticipated 100% airdrop of FRIEND last week.  Several users, however, seem to be having issues with claiming their airdrop.  ""I'm not selling my FRIEND airdrop (cause I can't even claim it),"" Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Reetika Malik said on X.  Malviya said the distribution was a ""concentrated airdrop,"" where leading creators took the most supply home.  ""Most users got 10x less airdrop than what they were expecting, so they are not even claiming that airdrop, as its less than 200$ for most of the retail investors,"" Malviya told CoinDesk in a direct message on X. ""But at the same time few people ended up making crazy amount. So its a clear case of very concentred airdrop where leading creators took the most supply home through airdrop, leaving retail in disguise.""

Key Area Breaks Records, Fueling Bullish Outlook","Polygon (MATIC), the Ethereum scaling solution, has been a hot topic for weeks. Its daily active addresses recently hit an all-time high, exceeding 1.4 million, a testament to the network’s growing user base. This surge in activity, however, presents a tale of two sides for MATIC. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Back? Record 267,000 New Users Spark Speculation Polygon’s Busy Streets: A Sign Of Growth Or Gridlock? The high traffic on Polygon’s virtual streets is undeniable. The consistent daily active addresses above 1 million suggest a thriving ecosystem. However, a closer look reveals a potential bottleneck. While the number of users has skyrocketed, transaction fees have taken a nosedive. This decline in fees translates to a drop in revenue for the network, raising concerns about Polygon’s long-term sustainability. JUST IN: Polygon PoS has recorded a new all time high in daily active addresses with 1.4M pic.twitter.com/YnOdDYbyJD — Today In Polygon (@TodayInPolygon) May 1, 2024 The story doesn’t end there. Despite the network’s bustling activity, the Total Value Locked (TVL) in Polygon’s Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols has dipped. This could indicate a cautious approach from DeFi whales, hesitant to fully commit their assets in the current market climate. MATIC Bulls Charge In, Waving Green Flags Despite the underlying concerns, MATIC bulls are charging forward. The token’s price experienced a surge exceeding 8% in the past 24 hours, currently hovering around $0.71. This bullish momentum could be attributed to a rise in buying pressure. Data suggests a decrease in MATIC supply on exchanges, coupled with an increase in holdings by large investors (whales). This shift indicates investor confidence in Polygon’s future potential. MATIC market cap currently at $7 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Technical Indicators Flash Bullish, But Caution Remains Technical indicators also paint a bullish picture for MATIC. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), Money Flow Index (MFI), and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) all point towards a potential upward trend. These indicators suggest strong buying pressure and a bullish upper hand in the market. However, the Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility, indicate that MATIC might be entering a period of lower price swings. Related Reading: Whales Dive In, But Dogecoin Price Sinks 20%: What’s Going On? While this could be a sign of consolidation after the recent surge, it also introduces an element of uncertainty. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously unpredictable, and technical indicators can be misleading. The Road Ahead: Can Polygon Navigate The Challenges? Polygon finds itself at a crossroads. The network’s high activity is a positive sign, but the decline in fees and DeFi TVL raises concerns. The recent price surge and bullish technical indicators offer a glimmer of hope for MATIC investors. However, navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market requires a cautious approach. For Polygon to maintain its current momentum, it needs to address the issue of declining fees. Exploring alternative revenue models or implementing fee structures that incentivize network usage are crucial steps. Additionally, fostering a robust DeFi ecosystem by attracting innovative protocols and users could reignite investor confidence and drive TVL growth.

26773086,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606341,1714720835,"Buy Crypto In May, Go Away: Arthur Hayes Shares His Top Altcoin Picks","In his most recent publication dated May 2, 2024, Arthur Hayes, the founder of exchange BitMEX, shared his insights into the crypto market’s recent tumultuous behavior and the broader macroeconomic signals shaping potential future trends. Titled “Mayday,” his essay directly addresses the crypto market, which has experienced significant volatility since mid-April. Stealth Money Printing Is Commencing Hayes begins by noting the observable distress in the crypto markets, which he attributes to a confluence of factors including the end of the US tax season, anticipatory fears about Federal Reserve policy decisions, the Bitcoin halving event, and stagnating growth in the assets under management (AUM) for US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He interprets these factors as a necessary purge of speculative excess, stating, “The tourists will sit out the next phase on the beach… if they can afford it. Us hard motherfuckers will hodl, and if possible, accumulate more of our favorite crypto reserve assets such as Bitcoin and Ether, and/or high-beta shitcoins like Solana, Dog Wif Hat, and dare I say Dogecoin (the OG doggie coin).” Related Reading: Crypto Prediction Website Reveals When The Cardano Price Will Reach $45 A significant portion of Hayes’ analysis focuses on the Federal Reserve’s recent adjustment to its quantitative tightening (QT) program. Previously set at a reduction of $95 billion per month, the Fed has dialed this back to $60 billion. Hayes interprets this as a covert form of quantitative easing, injecting an additional $35 billion per month into the dollar liquidity pool. He explains, “When you combine the Interest on Reserve Balances, RRP payments, and interest payments on US Treasury debt, the reduction in QT increases the amount of stimulus provided to the global asset markets each month.” Hayes also scrutinizes actions by the US Treasury, particularly under Secretary Janet Yellen. He discusses the Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA), which outlines the expected borrowing and cash balances for upcoming quarters. For Q2 2024, the Treasury anticipates borrowing $243 billion, a figure Hayes points out is $41 billion higher than the previous forecast, due to lower-than-expected tax receipts. He predicts this increased supply of Treasuries could lead to higher long-end rates, a situation Yellen may counter with yield curve control measures—a scenario that could catalyze a significant rally in Bitcoin and crypto prices. Related Reading: Ethereum “Has Been A Major Disappointment”: Trader Weighs In On This Crypto Cycle Hayes touches on the failure of Republic First Bank, emphasizing the response by monetary authorities as a key indicator of systemic fragility. He criticizes the federal safety net that ensures all depositors are made whole, arguing that it masks deeper vulnerabilities within the US banking system and leads to a stealth form of money printing, as uninsured deposits are effectively guaranteed by the government. This, Hayes argues, is a fundamental misalignment that could lead to significant inflationary pressures. Buy Crypto In May, Go Away Hayes is candid about his investment strategies in the current environment. He advocates buying now. “I’m buying Solana and doggie coins for momentum trading positions. For longer-term shitcoin positions, I’m upping my allocations in Pendle and will identify other tokens that are ‘on sale.’ I will use the rest of May to increase my exposure. And then it’s time to set it, forget it, and wait for the market to appreciate the inflationary nature of the recent US monetary policy announcements.” He concludes with a broad prediction that, despite the market’s recent volatility, the underlying liquidity conditions created by US monetary and fiscal policies will provide a floor for crypto prices, leading to a gradual upward trend. “While I don’t expect crypto to fully realize the recent US monetary announcements’ inflationary nature immediately, I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher,” he states, signaling his bullish outlook. For Bitcoin, Hayes predicts that the premier cryptocurrency will recapture the key $60,000 level and then move in a range between $60,000 and $70,000 until August because of the annual summer lull. At press time, BTC traded at $59,393.

Despite a recent price dip, the network has witnessed a surge in new user activity, sparking a wave of optimism. However, the outsized influence of large holders, known as whales, continues to cast a long shadow. Related Reading: Whales Dive In, But Dogecoin Price Sinks 20%: What’s Going On?

This influx marks the highest two-day increase since October 2022 and suggests a potential resurgence of interest in the Ethereum network. 📈 #Ethereum saw a milestone as April came to an end. 266.6K new wallets were created on April 28th and 29th, the highest 2-day stretch of network growth since October 8th and 9th, 2022.

Analysts speculate that the rise in new wallets could be fueled by several factors, including: Anticipation of future growth: Investors may be looking towards upcoming Ethereum upgrades that promise improved scalability and security, betting on the network’s long-term potential. Bargain hunters: The recent price dip might be seen as an attractive entry point for new investors seeking a discount on Ethereum. On Minnows And Whales While the number of new users is encouraging, a closer look at Ethereum’s address distribution reveals a stark disparity in holdings. According to CoinMarketCap, a staggering 97% of Ethereum addresses hold between $0 and $1,000 worth of the cryptocurrency. This signifies a large pool of small-scale investors, often referred to as “minnows.” However, the real power lies with a select few. Whale tracking platform Clank estimates that whales, representing only 0.10% of all Ethereum addresses, control a whopping 41% of the total circulating supply. This translates to an average holding of nearly 10 million ETH per whale, valued at a staggering $3.7 million. Ether market cap currently at $362 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Holding Steady: A Vote Of Confidence? Despite the recent price decline, Ethereum appears to be weathering the storm better than the broader crypto market. In fact, Ether is up more than 30% year-to-date (YTD) from an opening price of about $2,282. As of today, Ethereum sits at $3,014, with a total market capitalization of $362 billion.

The next key resistance sits at $3,085 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,355 swing high to the $2,813 low, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,150 level. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com If the bulls remain in action and push the price above $3,150, there could be a drift toward the $3,250 resistance.

Amid skepticism and divergent market opinions, Brandt’s projection places Bitcoin on a potential path to reclaim its all-time high near $74,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Predicts What To Expect Now Brandt’s Bullish Bitcoin Vision Peter Brandt, synonymous with market foresight, recently outlined a scenario where Bitcoin could experience a significant rally. His analysis, shared via a social media post on X with a BTC analyzed chart, suggests Bitcoin’s recent price movements align with patterns historically indicative of a bull market’s continuation. Despite the market’s recent downturns, Brandt’s projection points towards a potential surge to $74,000, a figure mirroring Bitcoin’s peak valuation. While Brandt’s optimistic outlook for Bitcoin has garnered attention, it also faces scrutiny from parts of the crypto community. Critics point to his past predictions, including significant downturns and peak valuations, as a reason for caution. Bruh was writing articles about Bitcoin Top and now saying it’s a correction. Come on man, Choose a side. — Sial (@aftabsial8) May 2, 2024 In response, Brandt emphasizes the critical role of adaptability in trading, noting: I can tell you know that you will end up losing all your capital. I’ve supported myself by trading for 50 years and know that successful traders have and execute the ability to be flexible. I’ll welcome your money. Split On Market Forecast Meanwhile, the broader crypto analyst community remains divided. Some echo Brandt’s sentiments, seeing the market’s current state as a temporary correction before a bullish reversal. Others, like analyst Scott Melker, suggest more bearish outcomes. They note the absence of key support levels that could lead to further declines if not held. Melker’s analysis indicates that, without these supports, Bitcoin could freefall to as low as $52,000. Further complicating the landscape are indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which Melker points out has not reached oversold levels — typically a sign of a potential rebound. $BTC Daily Broke and retested range lows as resistance.

The news, announced on Thursday, resulted in a 9% surge in the network’s native token, Toncoin (TON), pushing its value above the $5 mark. Pantera Capital Bullish On TON And Telegram Integration In a statement, Pantera Capital expressed enthusiasm about their latest investment in TON. The Layer 1 network, initially conceived by Telegram and continued by the open-source community, can potentially introduce cryptocurrency to the masses due to its extensive usage within the Telegram network. Related Reading: Ripple Unlocks 1 Billion XRP From Escrow – How Will This Impact Price? Telegram, used by over 900 million monthly active users, is known for personal and group communication, community building, content sharing, and more. Pantera Capital believes that by leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and user experience, combined with TON’s growing ecosystem, the network could become one of the largest in the cryptocurrency space. Pantera’s announcement further reads: We at Pantera Capital are thrilled to announce our latest investment in TON, a Layer 1 network originally designed by Telegram and continued by the open-source community. We believe TON has the capacity to introduce crypto to the masses because it is used extensively within the Telegram network. The integration of TON with Telegram aligns with the platform’s vision of providing a “seamless” and “borderless” experience for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments within its user base. Tether’s Integration With The Open Network As previously reported by NewsBTC, Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin in the market, USDT, recently announced the launch of its USDT dollar-pegged token and Tether Gold (XAUT) on The Open Network. This integration further increases the potential for P2P payments within Telegram’s extensive user base, a prospect that Pantera Capital aims to capitalize on. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $1 Million Per BTC “Fair Value”, Analyst Says In addition to the investment in TON, Pantera Capital is actively pursuing the launch of a new fund, Pantera Fund V, to raise over $1 billion. This fund aims to provide investors with diverse investment options across the blockchain asset spectrum, encompassing startup equity, early-stage tokens, and liquid tokens. The new fund has established a minimum investment threshold of $1 million for qualified investors, and the first close is scheduled for April 1, 2025. Insiders familiar with the matter have indicated that Pantera Fund V is anticipated to reach a similar size as its predecessor, which successfully amassed approximately $1.25 billion in capital two years ago. Following the disclosure of Pantera Capital’s investment in The Open Network, the price of TON experienced a notable 9% surge on Thursday, reaching a current trading price of $5.09.

Bitcoin Fell Below Short-Term Holder Cost Basis In Latest Crash In a new post on X, Maartunn discussed BTC’s recent close below the realized price of the short-term holders and stressed its importance in reclamation. The “realized price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that tracks the price at which the average investor on the Bitcoin network acquired their coins. In other words, it measures the average cost basis in the BTC market. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $1 Million Per BTC “Fair Value”, Analyst Says When the spot value of a cryptocurrency is below this metric, it means that the average investor in the market is carrying their coins at a loss right now. On the other hand, being above the indicator suggests that the holders as a whole are in the green currently. In the current topic, the realized price of the entire Bitcoin market isn’t of interest but rather of only a subsection: the short-term holders (STH). The STHs are the BTC investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. These holders represent the inconsistent side of the market, who easily show a reaction whenever a change like a crash or rally occurs in the sector. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the realized price specifically for these investors over the past year: The price of the asset appears to have seen a cross under this metric in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X The realized price of the Bitcoin STHs is floating around $58,500. During the latest crash, Bitcoin went as low as below $57,000, meaning that the plunge has put these investors under pressure. Historically, the average cost basis of the STHs has been significant for the cryptocurrency, as it has taken turns acting as support and resistance, depending on the market’s phase. During bullish trends, this metric often acts as a point of support. The chart shows that when Bitcoin had declined near this level earlier in the year, it had found a rebound. The metric acts as resistance during bear markets, keeping the price below it. These patterns may be related to how investor psychology works. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 244% Shiba Inu Rally Based On Bull Flag In bullish periods, the STHs might view their cost basis as a profitable buying opportunity, so they accumulate during dips in it, thus helping the price turn around. In bear markets, these investors could look at the level as a point of exit, as they may not believe the price will go up any further. After closing below the STH realized price earlier, Bitcoin is now fighting to reclaim this historical level. It now remains to be seen if support will once again be found or if the level will truly become lost. BTC Price Bitcoin has climbed back above the STH realized price, trading above $59,300. This is certainly a sign in the positive direction, but it’s hard to say whether this recovery will last.

This event has piqued the curiosity of both traders and analysts alike, sparking debates and expectations about the future trajectory of this popular meme coin. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 244% Shiba Inu Rally Based On Bull Flag Large SHIB Token Transfer Sparks Speculation Recently, the crypto community witnessed an extraordinary transaction involving the movement of nearly two trillion SHIB tokens from the trading platform Robinhood to an undisclosed wallet. This transfer, identified by Whale Alert, a blockchain tracking service, involved two tranches of 875 billion SHIB each, culminating in a total of 1.75 trillion SHIB. Valued at approximately $39.2 billion, this movement has led to rampant speculation about the potential implications for the SHIB market. 🚨 875,000,000,000 #SHIB (19,666,682 USD) transferred from #Robinhood to unknown wallethttps://t.co/hxSvwFxC0E — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 1, 2024 The timing and scale of this transaction have raised questions about its motives, whether it be a strategic move by a major investor or simply a reallocation within diverse portfolios. The lack of clarity surrounding the destination wallet adds intrigue and uncertainty within the trading community. Bullish Forecasts Amidst Market Corrections Amidst this massive token movement, cryptocurrency analysts have been closely monitoring SHIB’s performance. Notably, Ali Charts, a respected figure in the crypto analysis sphere, has projected a potential bullish breakout for SHIB. Ali suggests that SHIB could reach as high as $0.000072323 and advises traders to consider buying around the $0.000018343 mark to capitalize on the anticipated surge. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu’s 8% decline last week, juxtaposed with a 7.8% increase in the past day, illustrates the volatile nature of meme coin investments. Analysts like Bunchhieng have recently speculated that Shiba Inu could reach $0.0001. This projection is based on SHIB’s 2021 rally patterns, suggesting a repeat could propel the meme coin to new highs. Bunchhieng emphasized that similar historical trends might lead to significant price movements for Shiba Inu, considering the increased burn rate that could positively impact its valuation. Addressing skepticism regarding SHIB’s market cap and potential growth, Bunchhieng reassured that the crypto sector often defies conventional expectations, opening possibilities for substantial gains.

26754400,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606184,1714695047,Crypto Prediction Website Reveals When The Cardano Price Will Reach $45,"Crypto prediction website Telegaon has provided insights into when Cardano (ADA) will hit $45. A rise to that price level represents an 8.900% price gain from its current price level, which will appeal to ADA holders, especially given the crypto token’s recent unimpressive price action. When Cardano Will Rise To $45 Telegaon predicted in a blog post that Cardano will reach $45 by 2050. They highlighted $45.87 as the maximum price the crypto token will likely attain that year. Meanwhile, $39.12 and $42.41 are predicted to be ADA’s minimum and average prices that year. The prediction site claims that Cardano’s parabolic rise will occur due to several factors. Source: Telegaon These factors include “trading volume, market trends, investor sentiment, technological developments, and external influences.” It is worth noting that the Cardano has performed incredibly well in terms of technological advancements as the network has continued to rank among the top blockchains by development activity. This factor is expected to play a massive role in Cardano’s attainment of this price prediction, especially considering that the crypto projects likely to survive until 2050 are the ones that can adapt and progress with the times. Cardano has shown such quality, seeing how the team has continued to build actively, especially with the implementation of the network’s smart contract functionality. Meanwhile, Telegaon also outlined its price predictions for Cardano in the years leading up to 2050. In the short term, they do not seem bullish on Cardano as they predict that the highest price the crypto token could rise to this year is $2.15. Based on their prediction, Cardano will likely surpass its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10 in 2025, as they predict that $3.14 is the maximum price the crypto token will hit next year. More Bullish Price Predictions For ADA This Year Last year, Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, suggested that Cardano could rise to as high as $11 this year. Specifically, he mentioned that the crypto token will rise to this level when the bull run returns after the Bitcoin halving. With the halving already taking place, Cardano could be primed for such a run. Crypto expert Jason Appleton made a more bullish prediction, stating that Cardano would rise to $32 in this bull market. Appleton added that this price level is attainable in the “most prime of conditions by the peak of this bull market cycle.” The crypto expert claimed that this parabolic rise would make Cardano one of the most valuable altcoins during this cycle. At the time of writing, Cardano is trading at around $0.44, up over 4% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.
