42376646,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbiN,1383762604,Homeland Security Committee chairman responds to “Silk Road 2.0”,"US Congressmen have called for a more strategic approach to targeting black market dark web sites, after the launch of Silk Road 2.0 today.  Senator Tom Carper, chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, issued a statement just hours after the reincarnation of Silk Road.  “This new website – launched barely a month after Federal agents shut down the original Silk Road -- underscores the inescapable reality that technology is dynamic and ever-evolving and that government policy needs to adapt accordingly,” said Carper, whose Committee is heading a formal inquiry into virtual currencies.  Carper said that ‘whack-a-mole’ approaches to dark web marketplaces are not as effective as broader policymaking. “We need to develop thoughtful, nimble and sensible federal policies that protect the public without stifling innovation and economic growth,” he said. “Our committee intends to have that conversation - among others - at our hearing this month on virtual currency.”  Silk Road 2.0 came online Wednesday, headed by someone calling himself The Dread Pirate Roberts. This is the original name used by Ross Ulbricht, the alleged founder of Silk Road, who was arrested by the FBI.  The site uses a defaced FBI seizure notice on its login screen. This is the same as the notice displayed on Silk Road after it was closed down, except with a modification. It now reads: “This hidden site has risen again.”  Straight after logging in, users are directed to a personalized welcome page, which states: “We rise again”. The ‘profile’ page has been updated, now enabling users to select two-factor authentication.  The list of products is largely the same as before, featuring items such as cannabis, ecstasy, forgeries, prescriptions and money, however, there are currently only a few hundred items for sale, compared with the thousands that were on offer on the first Silk Road.  Silk Road 2.0’s new founder said that his site was enjoying 1100 connections per second hours after launch. His site is as much about principles as it is about drug sales, he said in a tweet. “Our proceeds will fund more anonymity technology research - you don't need drugs to care about privacy. We are freedom fighters,” he claimed.    @the_pouar Our proceeds will fund more anonymity technology research - you don't need drugs to care about privacy. We are freedom fighters.      — Dread Pirate Roberts (@DreadPirateSR) November 6, 2013    There has been some continuity with Silk Road. The forums for the site have been operational since October 7, just days after the previous site was taken down. At least one of the original Silk Road’s former moderators is now involved with the new site, according to this Mashable interview with DPR.  The new operator claims to have better security than Ulbricht did, and says that there are measures in place to ensure that people get access to their coins, even if the site is closed. “We have learned hard lessons from the unfortunate events of recent weeks, and the man hours that have gone into this new release are phenomenal,” says a message on the site’s greeting page.  But he has competition. After Silk Road was taken down in early October, there were several sites offering alternative services to users. Black Market Reloaded and Sheep Market both offer similar services to those wanting to buy illegal goods online. BrainMagic and Drugmarket are openly displaying illegal drugs on their pages, and both are accepting bitcoin payments. The same goes for BitPharma and The People’s Drug Store.  There are also web sites specializing in marijuana alone. German has DeDope, while the Netherlands has NL Growers. Ecanna provides weed and related paraphernalia, all for sale in bitcoin. Budster, while still up, has already seen growing pains relating to the processing of escrow orders.  There are also some sites whose future is more in question. Atlantis closed down, Deepbay is not loading, and Silk Road Reloaded has been quiet for three weeks, with no demo yet. And in a sign of how untrustworthy some of these sites can be, another site called Project Black Flag closed after the organizer said that he ‘panicked’ and stole all of the bitcoins. When that site launched in mid-October, it was labeled Silk Road, and was styled after the original site.  Now, Silk Road 2.0’s rollout is nearly complete. According to its timeline, a wiki will go live on Nov 7, while bitcoin deposits and withdrawals will be enabled on Friday Nov 8. Orders may be placed from Saturday Nov 9 onwards.  US lawmakers may be looking for a more strategic approach to take down drug peddling web sites, but not all policymakers agree. Former UN Secretary General UN Kofi Annan, now a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, called for an end to the war on drugs this week.  “Citizens see huge amounts of their taxes spent on harsh policies that are not working,” he said in a piece for CNN, arguing that illicit drug trafficking can create opportunities for organized crime, and that the time is overdue for policy reform. “It is time for a smarter approach to drug policy. Putting people's health and safety first is an imperative, not an afterthought.”  What do you think of the new site? Is it a con? Will the Feds shut it down soon? Tell us in the comments.

42376643,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbeb,1383757222,Florida cosmetic surgery center becomes first to accept bitcoin,"A Miami-based cosmetic treatments clinic has decided to accept bitcoin as payment for services.  Vanity Cosmetic Surgery  , which specializes in plastic or reconstructive treatments, is now allowing its patients to pay in bitcoin, which is a first.  ""We are the only cosmetic medical center to officially accept bitcoin in the world as a valid form of payment,"" says Carlos Yela, advertising and PR manager for the clinic.  Bitcoin as a payment method for customers was an idea brought to management by Yela, who has been put in charge of spearheading the medical centers' online presence.  He said:  ""It was a project I presented to our managing staff, as part of our web expansion strategy, we are always looking for ways to access new niches and circles, and bitcoin is an excellent opportunity for us to accomplish this.""  One of the key benefits to Vanity Medical Center accepting bitcoin is the worldwide ubiquity of the currency. Its electronic and frictionless properties give customers from all over the world an easy way to pay for the clinic's services.  One offering that the medical center has is a ""complete recovery program"". This is for patients who come in for services, but are not local to the Miami area. It includes transport, accommodation, post treatment therapy and nutrition under the care of the clinic's nurses and doctors.  ""We think that times are changing and we can't stay away from it, one of these changes is how people interact with each other and with their health providers, we see this as we get more patients from out of state and from other countries every day,"" says Vela about the global opportunity that bitcoin presents.  Vanity Cosmetic Surgery has set up a special page for prospective customershttp://vanitymiami.com/bitcoin/ who are interested in paying for surgical procedures with bitcoin. This allows them to sign up to receive more information. Vela says that a number of people have shown interest in a short period of time.  ""The decision [to accept] bitcoin in our center is new but after only 4 days of the announcement, over 20 people have already showed interest and requested more information about this payment and our services,"" he said.  ""The potential is clear, bitcoin is a currency that knows no boundaries, that means for any person in Australia, or Siberia or maybe down the street, who currently use bitcoin that they will have instant access to our services without the headache of exchange fees.""

42376654,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbsR,1383740303,Brazilian magazine creates bitcoin paywall,"The popular Brazilian science and culture magazine Superinteressante has created a bitcoin paywall.  Not only is the publication accepting the digital currency, they've embraced it by publishing articles aimed to educate the population of Brazil on its benefits.  The magazine announced its acceptance of bitcoin in a recent post:    Buy SUPER articles with bitcoins      SUPERINTERESSANTE magazine is ahead of a whole new experience, and you're invited to take part.    In the November issue, you'll learn about a district in Berlin where bitcoins - a virtual currency - are replacing conventional money. In the article, you'll understand how this virtual currency became more valuable in the last few years and how it makes transferring money online as easy as sending an email.    But you don't even have to wait for your print magazine. If you click below, you can gain access to our article about bitcoins and other special e-books published by SUPER. You just have to open your digital wallet and spend a few thousandths of a bitcoin. You will also test the first journalistic paywall entirely based on bitcoins.    ""Superinteressante magazine has been known in Brazil as an innovative publication, so it was important to us to experiment with a such a disruptive technology as bitcoins,"" said Rafael Kenski, the magazine's editor.  First published in 1987, Superinteressante (often referred to as just Super) is owned by the Brazilian publishing giant Editora Abril.  Kenski believes in the power of micropayments for publishing, something that Super is specifically testing with its option to pay for articles using bitcoin.  ""The publishing industry has been testing several ways to monetize online content, and micropayment has always been one possibility. Due to large fees, bad user experience and other technical difficulties, it has not really worked so far. Bitcoin can solve some of these problems, so it was worth testing it,"" he said  The publication is using the services of Mercado Bitcoin, an exchange and processor, to facilitate bitcoin payments. Rodrigo Batista, the CEO of Sao Paolo-based Mercado, says that Super is giving bitcoin a shot, just to see if it will be successful.  ""They are giving bitcoin a chance, and feeling out how this goes,"" said Batista.  Batista says that bitcoin is still quite small in Brazil, but Super and other media outlets are getting BTC into the national consciousness.  ""It's still a very small environment, but it's getting some press coverage here,"" he said.  And Batista is not overly concerned about the government of Brazil intervening in any way in regards to bitcoin regulation.  ""They don't even bother right now, they don't care. [Mercado is] trading less than 2,000 BTC per month. We would probably just need to obey some minimum capital restrictions at some point, but that's all.""  Kenski, the magazine editor, says that a history in Brazil of currency disruptions might make bitcoin palatable to the general public.  ""Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, we suffered from hyperinflation and changed the national currency several times, so Brazilians have a lot of knowledge on how to deal with several currencies at the same time. There is the potential for bitcoins to become popular here, it just has not happened yet.""  For the time being it at least seems that Super is benefitting from trying out bitcoin as a new form of payment.  ""It is too soon to know if it will pay off financially, but it already worked as a test of the concept,"" says Kenski.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/06/brazilian-magazine-creates-bitcoin-paywall,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/621104d8ebe00e6b5c1bed1542ff56137605aba3-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376662,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbyj,1383715669,Bitcoin Price Soars Over $266 and Hits a New All-Time High,"UPDATE (7th November, 08:56 GMT): The bitcoin price just hit $300 on Mt. Gox. This is the highest it's ever been.  The highest trades at the time of writing have been at $309.99 at 08:45 GMT. Bitcoin prices have been steadily increasing over recent weeks, but have accelerated pace in the last twenty-four hours.  Today's price spike follows the discovery of so-called ""Silk Road 2.0"", a resurrected version of Silk Road that came to light yesterday.  Senator Tom Carper, Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, has already issued a statement stressing the ""inescapable reality that technology is dynamic and ever-evolving and that government policy needs to adapt accordingly"".  As the price run continues, so too does regulatory discussion, with two Senate committees convening in the coming weeks to discuss the regulatory issues surrounding virtual currencies such as bitcoin.  The price rise in recent days hasn't quite matched the velocity of that seen in April yet, when the price more than doubled in the course of just one week. But it's entirely possible that this could change as the week continues.  ----------------------------------------  UPDATE (6th November, 12:35 GMT): The price of bitcoin crept up to $269 at 05:30 and then fluctuated mildly until it reached a new high of $270 at 10:30.  The total number of bitcoins in circulation is currently 11,955,775 and the market cap, using the current CoinDesk BPI now stands at $3.2bn - the highest it has ever been. A week ago, the market cap stood at $2.3bn, with the figure only reaching $1.8bn during April's price peak.  Data from Bitcoinity shows some 576,920 BTC have been traded in the past seven days, with 215,834 BTC (37%) of this being traded in the last 24 hours alone.  ----------------------------------------  The price of bitcoin reached an all-time high this morning, beating the previous record of $266, achieved in April.  Trades were made this morning at 04:45 GMT over $267 on Mt. Gox, which is currently not included in the Bitcoin Price Index (due to lengthy withdrawal times), but still represents 24% of global bitcoin trading volume.  The value of the cryptocurrency has been increasing rapidly since 2nd October – the day after the closure of black marketplace Silk Road and the arrest of its owner Ross Ulbricht.  Many were of the opinion that the closure of such a high-traffic bitcoin site would irreparably damage the cryptocurrency. They have since been proven wrong.  The Bitcoin Price Index shows the price dipped from over $125 at 4pm (BST) on 2nd October, to $82 just three hours later, but was back up to $100 by midnight. After that, the price rocketed, reaching $200 a little under three weeks later.  This week, the price has been climbing at quite a pace, even jumping 8.7% from 3rd November to 4th November.  Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, said: ""This new record for bitcoin's USD exchange price demonstrates the societal value of a monetary unit with a predictable and fixed supply.""  What’s behind the rise?  A bitcoin investor, who wishes not to be named, said positive media coverage over the last few weeks has contributed to the interest in, and demand for, bitcoin.  ""The story about the guy in Norway who bought $27 worth of bitcoin years ago, then cashed it in and bought an apartment has led to a lot of retail investors believing it is easy to make money speculating in bitcoins,"" he explained.  He went on to say the announcement that new bitcoin company Circle had raised $9m in funding was ""huge news"" and brought a lot of legitimacy to the space, thus encouraging more people to invest.  ""I also believe that the price has been driven up by the big institutional buyers that have entered the market recently, some via SecondMarket's Bitcoin Investment Trust,"" the investor added.  He went on to say that network difficultly has grown so much that it is hard to accumulate bitcoins by investing in mining. ""A lot of people got burnt buying mining equipment. Now they realize they won't make their bitcoins back and have to go to the exchanges and buy bitcoins to gain exposure.""  The final factor the investor attributed the price rise to was the increased interest and exchange volume coming from China.  Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China agrees. He believes Bitcoin prices have risen sharply in the past months because of ""new buzz and demand in the China market""  ""With BTC China's elimination of trading commission fees, we achieved and surpassed our goal of raising awareness for bitcoin in China, and that has really helped pump up the prices of bitcoin globally,"" he added.  Will the rise continue?  Lee is adamant that, in the long run, the price will continue to increase ""until it hits the price range of a globally-adopted asset"". He added:  ""With simple math and using some logic, you can quickly compute that globally adopted asset price. You would calculate and compare the circulation value, against the average holding times the number of people using bitcoins.""  Lee sees the value increasing as more and more people become interested in digital currency, likening interest in bitcoin to interest in the Internet back in the early days.  ""In the mid-1990s, the technical folks were the early adopters and the first to recognize the benefits. Then, over time and with more press coverage, the mainstream joined the party,"" he explained.  Unlike the Internet, the adoption and popularity of digital currency can be directly tracked and measured, using the price of bitcoin.  Will history repeat itself?  After the last high of $266 in April, there was a huge crash, with the price falling to a low of $50, six days later. The value then fluctuated over the next three weeks before becoming slightly steadier.  There are concerns that the price will follow this pattern and the current steep increase is building up to another crash.  ""Price crashes tend to happen when you see near vertical increases. It all comes down to human nature - when greed and fear switch places, this leads to high volatility,"" he said.  The anonymous investor we spoke to agreed with this sentiment said he is ""pretty sure"" bitcoin will crash again.  ""It is impossible to know when this will happen and it might be from much higher levels than today. When the price starts going down a lot of the new investors will get scared and sell out on the low again,"" he explained.  He went on to say that if bitcoin becomes more mainstream, the price will rise to a much higher level than it is at today.  The investor hopes that as time goes on and bitcoin gains a larger circulation and the public becomes more educated about digital currency, the future price volatility will be more moderate.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/06/bitcoin-price-soars-over-266-and-hits-a-new-all-time-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a4bf927a7f923f199554eb5fba97863bfd501d2-1000x640.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376653,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbrB,1383698625,Senate committees to hold hearings about virtual currency,"Two senate committees are expected to convene soon regarding possible regulatory issues related to decentralized electronic currencies such as bitcoin.  Congressional aide sources inside the Senate told the Wall Street Journal that members of government and representatives from the private sector are expected to testify during the hearings. No dates have been set, but the hearings are expected to occur within the next few weeks.  ""The Bitcoin Foundation thinks these upcoming hearings are good for consumers and others as education on bitcoin is important,"" Jinyoung Englund, the foundation's director of public affairs, told CoinDesk. She added:    ""Understanding the unique possibilities and challenges of virtual currency in general, and bitcoin specifically, is important to the process of writing regulatory policy.      As a foundation, we welcome opportunities to educate and dispel myths on bitcoin to legislators, regulators and the public.""    On 12th August, senators Tom Coburn and Thomas Carper sent a letter to Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, seeking guidance on virtual currencies.  ""Our committee staff has been interviewing individuals inside and outside of government regarding the threats and risks related to virtual currency - and also the promise it holds in some areas,"" the letter states.  ""The expansive nature of this emerging technology demands a holistic and whole-government approach in order to understand and provide a sensible regulatory framework for their existence.""  In August, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) hosted a conference at the US Treasury to discuss distributed finance issues.  Representatives from the Internal Revenue Service the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), among other government entities, were in attendance.  The news of multiple senate hearings on virtual currencies comes at a time of high bitcoin valuations. The current price of bitcoin has reached a level not seen since last April, when the price hit $266 per coin on one exchange.    Andrew Beal, a lawyer who focuses on helping businesses with federal and state securities compliance as part of the firm Crowley Strategy, says these hearings will only help government better understand bitcoin.    ""The legal and regulatory foundation for virtual currencies will be laid over the next few years; these hearings are an opportunity to ensure that lawmakersare getting the right information from the right people,"" he said.  Englund, expressed optimism that representatives from the bitcoin industry would be involved. ""It would certainly enrich the hearing to invite bitcoin experts from academia, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs of bitcoin companies.""  She said it's a first step towards literacy and understanding, adding: ""As the first congressional hearings on bitcoin, we expect this to be more introductory and educational in nature.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/06/senate-committees-to-hold-hearings-about-virtual-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/105c7cc59a9c931d3eb5f37a3ef999fc4f09774b-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
