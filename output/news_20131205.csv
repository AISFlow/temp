42425169,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv7xh,1386266600,Exchange Platform Safello Demonstrates Sweden's First Bitcoin ATM,"Bitcoin exchange Safello will unveil Sweden's first bitcoin ATM next week, after announcing their work on the Lamassu machine just three weeks ago.  The ATM will be on display next Monday at Stockholm's STHLM TECH Meetup – converting users' cash into bitcoin and depositing it in their wallet addresses.  For now, the machine is operating in Safello's office while the company puts the finishing touches to its service. It will move to a more permanent location soon.  “We are in discussion with a big mall in the centre of Stockholm. We aim to cooperate with them for the first ATM deployment,” said Frank Schuil, CEO and co-founder of Safello. He added:  “Initially it will be one ATM that will be installed, and pending the success of the implementation, others may follow.”  When the company originally described their ATM, Stockholm mall Gallarian was cited as a target.  Safello will be operating the ATM, which will be owned by 19-year-old bitcoin entrepreneur Ludvig Oberg, an angel investor in the company. Oberg and Safello will share revenue from the machine.  Not just any customer will be able to use the machine, however.  Schuil says the financial authority in Sweden sees bitcoin as a “high-risk event”, requesting additional KYC (Know Your Customer) questions beyond the normal ID verification. Consequently, the firm will take users through an extended KYC process via its website before allowing them to use the ATM. He added:  “The ATM becomes a cash deposit point for our users that are already verified with extended KYC.”  Manufactured by Lamassu, the bitcoin ATM cost $5,000 to build (this includes the Google Nexus tablet used for its display). It is the latest in a line of machines shipped by the company. Lamassu has delivered ATMs to over 13 cities since it sold its first in October.  Safello is moving quickly to market bitcoin. The company was founded in July, and its online trading site only went live back in August. It began promoting its plans for an ATM in mid-November.  So far, ATMs have seen great success: bringing bitcoin into the public arena in a way that wasn’t possible before. Canada’s first ATM, developed by US-based firm Robocoin, took over $1m in its first month of operation in a Vancouver coffee shop.  Those interested in the demo event can register using the promo code ‘bitcoinATM’.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/05/exchange-platform-safello-demonstrates-swedens-first-bitcoin-atm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/632bea0c064fcd61a81659eaf8acdba57eb412ff-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425168,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv7zh,1386263427,Kentucky Police Chief's Salary Paid in Bitcoin,"News that a small-town police chief from Vicco, Kentucky, will accept his salary in bitcoin has taken the web by storm.  Later today, Vicco's mayor Johnny Cummings will make the transaction: sending bitcoin from the town's wallet to Police Chief Tony Vaughn.  ""The city has a bitcoin account now,"" Cummings explained, ""Thursday's the pay period so today we're going to transfer his money.""  But Vicco's involvement with bitcoin doesn't stop here. Cummings announced that he and Vaughn would donate their salaries for the month to a wallet setup for donations to the embattled town.  Long-term investment  Cummings believes the digital currency will rise in value over time, with the wallet acting as a long-term investment for the town's public works. He said:  ""We're going to let it lay there for a while. As the city needs things done, we're going to take part of it out, but leave the majority in that account. That's what we talked about last night.""  Two days ago, The Hazard Herald, a local newspaper, reported that Vicco's city commission approved Vaughn's request to have his salary paid in bitcoin after several weeks of study.  This approval paved the way for the city's transaction with Vaughn today, which would make it the first instance of a US government entity paying an employee via cryptocurrency.  According to Cummings, Vaughn's salary would have federal and state taxes deducted before being converted to bitcoin at the prevailing rate. This would be done on a month-by-month basis.  Small town, big support  Vaughn is the sole member of Vicco's police department, and its first policeman in 20 years. The town has a population of little more than 300 people within its city limits.  Cummings said the bitcoin community has shown great support for the town, with one bitcoin user offering to pay the salaries of Vaughn and any other policemen the town may hire. Vaughn could not be reached for comment at press time.  However, a potential drawback of this plan was highlighted today when the price of bitcoin fell dramatically. CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index showed a drop of 22.5% to $889.01 following a statement issued by China's central bank that warned of the cryptocurrency's risks.  Despite bitcoin's price tumble today, Cummings said both Vicco and Vaughn remain undeterred in their commitment to the currency. He said:  ""Chief Vaughn has decided this is the currency he wants to be paid in. Everything goes up and down, that's life. But we feel that the currency is stable enough after studying it.""  Cummings added that other city employees are now considering getting their salaries paid in bitcoin instead of fiat currency. ""They're all inquiring and looking into it now,"" he said.  Media attention  Vicco was the subject of intense media attention after it was featured on satirical current affairs programme the Colbert Report. It became known to many as the smallest US town to pass a fairness ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.  According to the Hazard Herald, the town received a number of donations after the episode aired, including playground equipment for a new park near City Hall.  ""That was just crazy, that was when all the production companies and everyone else kept calling,"" Cummings said.  When asked if Vicco's move to approve Vaughn's pay in bitcoin was an attempt to attract media attention to the town again, Cummings said:  ""We didn't expect the media to jump on this, it's just something we decided to do because we're always looking at new ways of doing things. I guess the media attention is starting now, that's why you're calling.""  Vicco is bracing itself for economic hardship as the coal mining industry it depends on faces a severe decline, Cummings added.  ""The coal industry is dying here, and my job as mayor is to try and find other avenues for the people of the city, because it's not good right now,"" he said.

42425193,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv8Vh,1386261047,Meet China's Biggest Bitcoin Multi-Millionaire,"This article was originally posted by Eric Mu on Danwei, a Chinese media and Internet tracking news site.  Hidden in a pedestrian-only lane in Beijing’s tech district of Zhongguancun, Cheku Café (车库咖啡厅) is not easy to find and appears to be an unassuming eatery like its neighbors.  But if you climb up the dark staircase, you’ll blunder into what appears to be a university library: youngsters scattered around scores of desks in a large, cavernous room, gazing, typing on the glowing screens, chattering, laughing and napping.  The name Cheku, meaning garage, speaks of ambition by alluding to tech giant Apple’s rather humble origins. Some believe that China’s equivalents of the Cupertino tech giant may begin in this place: the idea of the café is to provide startup tech companies a communal office where rent is cheap and entrepreneurs can communicate, inspire each other and conceive ideas.  One evening last week I visited Cheku. At about 6.30pm, the room began to fill up. People conversed with familiarity, even though many had never previously met. For an outsider, the conversations were a little bewildering: “How many coins do you possess? How did you get them?”  Aside from its reputation as a tech hub, Cheku Café was chosen to host the event because of something that happened in March this year: an American student named Jake Smith asked if he could pay for his cup of coffee with bitcoins.  With hindsight, the 0.2 bitcoins he handed over now looks a high price to pay for the beverage, though for some of the bitcoiners I met at Cheku Café, they believe the incident will go down in history.  Origins  In the second week of November, the exchange rate of bitcoin to major currencies took a sudden jump, with its value more than doubling within a week.  As of 20th November, bitcoin was trading around $500 per coin, triggering speculation that the bitcoin “bubble” is being driven by strong demand from China, an argument that is supported by strong volume increases observed on Chinese bitcoin exchange websites such as BTC China and Huobi.com.  The first “cryptocurrency” in the world, apparently invented by a person or group known to the world as Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin was born with the mission to solve the intrinsic flaws of fiat currencies and early digital currencies: inflation, double-spending, counterfeiting, cash robbery etc.  The assumptions that the system is based on is that the majority of participants are honest. Every transaction needs to be confirmed by all the participants.  In theory, a group of cheaters could take control of the currency if they acquired more computing power than all the other users – a condition that hasn’t even come close to materializing. Yet, the protocol is open source and it offers transparency no banking system can compete with.  Many believe that the most promising application for bitcoin is for online payments. Unlike using a credit card, payment made with bitcoin don't carry a transaction fee (though one can opt to pay a small amount for faster confirmation speed) and though every transaction is documented, it can only be traced to the virtual account that holds the bitcoin, but not real world payers.  Thanks to this anonymity, bitcoin gained a little notoriety for being used for drug sales and money laundering. When the FBI shut down Silk Road, an online narcotics marketplace that used bitcoin as primary currency, the exchange rate tanked more than 40% in one day.  A Chinese bitcoin multi-millionaire  Li Xiaolai, was a speaker at the event I attended at Cheku Café. He is perhaps the most famous figure in the Chinese bitcoin world.  Li admitted on one occasion that his bitcoin holdings are a six digit amount. The exchange rate at the time of writing values that at more than $50m, but such comparison may not do bitcoin justice as unlike $50m, 100,000 bitcoins is about 1/100 of all existing bitcoins. The world’s most famous bitcoin millionaires are the Winklevoss twins who own 120,000 bitcoins.  Li, 41, studied accounting at college. Following graduation he worked as a salesman, and later as an English teacher. Li said on one occasion that English teaching is really just a type of sales in China: with millions of young Chinese aspiring to go abroad, English teaching is essentially selling a dream.  Li also published several books such as “Breakthrough on TOEFL essential vocabulary in 21 days”, “How to get high scores in TOEFL essay”. But he did not make much money from these endeavors.  In the first two years after the first bitcoins were minted in 2009, the virtual currency was used among geeks and worth no more than a few cents.  Few people knew about them. Stories of a man spending 10,000 bitcoins to buy a pizza and of a hacker attack that sent the price down by half began to interest the media and global interest in the currency grew.  Li recounted his roller coaster trip starting from the year when his employer, the test cramming school operator New Oriental, went public. As a new employee, Li was allowed to buy a small number of pre-IPO shares.  While the company was well received at the New York Exchange, many of Li’s colleagues had fears that the company was overvalued and did not have a bright future, which Li described as “insider’s pessimism”. Li decided he wanted to invest his money elsewhere, and this was when he found out about bitcoin.  Li described the moment when he first learned about bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was so elegant that Li wasted no time in finding the paper by Satoshi Nakamoto on the Internet.  Although he couldn’t understand it completely, it didn’t prevent him from selling all his shares and loading up on bitcoins. He was convinced that this thing was going to be big.  In the days that followed, Li said he had many sleepless nights, but as his bitcoins grew in value, he decided to expand his profits by investing in a container worth of computers for mining.  Mining  In the paper Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Satoshi Nakamoto explained bitcoin mining:  “The steady addition of a constant amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.”  One brilliant touch is unifying the self-interest and well being of community. Newly created bitcoins are used to compensate miners who spent computing power and electricity to process transactions, and keep the network healthy.  While the miners may be perfectly self-interested in their endeavor, their selfishness is essential to the system. The speed of new coins being injected into the system is also designed to slow down as time passes and more people join the bitcoin economy.  By artificially increasing the difficulty, the miners are forced to upgrade their equipment constantly, to gain advantage in the competition for coins. When Li realized this, he divested his mining venture.  Today, he focuses on bitcoin lending – large transactions of coins usually happen offline to avoid radical fluctuations of value. Since there is no law regarding bitcoin trades, people like Li who have a reputation are usually invited to act as a guarantor in the deal.  Infrastructure and industry  Many compare bitcoin with a gold rush – not only that gold was hard to find but that those that sell shovels end up making more money than people who actually do the mining.  A Shenzhen-based company called ASICminer, founded in early 2012 by three new college graduates, has been making tens of millions by making specialized miners.  Bitcoin mining  computers need to have a special type of microchip that is an application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC. In the early days, there were only three companies – two based in China, producing the bitcoin ASIC chips, the margins were high: One mining machine that cost 2,000 yuan ($328) to build could be sold for 40,000 yuan.  ASICminer also uses a novel way of fund raising. The company issued virtual stocks which investors buy using bitcoins. Dividends are also paid in bitcoins. 796.com, a virtual share and futures trading exchange, has four stocks being traded, including ASICminer.  At the time of writing, the stock was trading at 0.0048 bitcoin per share, a fraction of what it was at the beginning of the year, though many investors have earned enough in dividends to cover their losses.  Li Xiaolai is an investor in ASICminer, and has been with the company for a while, but said that he would not recommend it for the faint-hearted as radical fluctuations are common in the bitcoin world.  Regulation may be around the corner  The idea of a decentralized currency means that bitcoin can work with or without a government, something not all governments may accept with grace.  Compounding the potential annoyance to governments is that sales made in bitcoins are often un-taxable, and once people start using bitcoin in preference to fiat money, it will necessarily result in loss of tax income.  Many predict that governments will eventually bring the unruly bitcoin under its reins.  But perhaps not: the FBI itself has acknowledged that “Bitcoins are not illegal in and of themselves and have known legitimate uses.”  The worst case scenario for bitcoiners is that governments will seek to shut down the whole system. Many believe that it is impossible given its peer to peer decentralized nature. There is no central sever to take down.  Unless governments begin a long and determined campaign of arresting people who own or use bitcoin, it will be very difficult to destroy it, but a hostile stance from the authorities would undoubtedly hurt speculators’ confidence.  Original: If the US or Chinese governments outlaw bitcoin, the value may take a big dive, but in the long term, many bitcoiners believe, it will bounce back and grow as it did before.  Editor's note: China's central bank has just announced its stance on bitcoin, which had a significant impact on the price.  For a dedicated bitcoiner like Li, the ups and downs only serve to make him identify with bitcoin more strongly. A true bitcoiner is not an investor in the typical sense of the word, since they see owning bitcoins as even more desirable than owning fiat money and are determined to go through the odds, with great indifference to the financial outcome.  At the Cheku Café event, rarely did anyone ask about other types of money: they just wanted to know how many bitcoins you possessed.  Li said that he owns no real estate and no car, his assets are almost all virtual. He also described his own situation as a dilemma – if bitcoin took a drop, he would lose a fortune, but only when you think from the perspective of fiat money.  From the perspective of a bitcoiner, he would rather that bitcoin lose value so he could do what he once was capable of doing: buy thousands of bitcoins in one go.  Passport to the future and USA  “This is the first time in history that human beings have found a way to ensure the inviolability of personal property,” said Li in a celebratory tone, “If you remember, two years ago, I posted on Twitter that I would do something I called a ‘virtual immigration’.”    When I asked my travel agent to obtain a visa for me, he said it couldn’t be done because I had no house, no car – the car I drive is registered under my friend’s name and my bank account balance is a joke.      Do you know the easiest way to immigrate to the US? You get a travel visa and board an airliner, and you never come back. But if it was that easy, why don't most of you do it? Come on, be honest, you don’t want to live in this place, do you? The answer is that you have all your assets locked here.    Li finally got his green card. His story may be the start of a trend. The Winklevoss twins warned American regulators not to push innovation out of the US and into China.  While there is no sign of China beating the US in creating a bitcoin economy, with bitcoin making asset relocation so easy, one can foresee waves of Chinese bitcoin immigrants hitting the American shores in a future not so remote.  Finale  Many believe that the fate of bitcoin is connected to whether it will be adopted by enough people so that one can pay bills easily with it. Li does not believe bitcoin will replace fiat money any time soon.  As long as it stays a perfect speculative vehicle, Li is happy. “If you can’t buy a breakfast with gold, does it make your gold less valuable?” Asked Mr. Li rhetorically.  This gives rise to another question – As bitcoins continue to appreciate, will it send the world into a deflationary spiral because it rewards hoarding and discourages spending? This is a view held by many bitcoin critics, including prominent economist Paul Krugman. Some think that a coin worth hundreds of dollars is a ridiculous idea.  Bitcoin’s answer to the deflationary spiral question is infinite divisibility. Even if the world had only one bitcoin, it is more than enough for all the people, because it can be divided infinitive times.  My own observations at the Cheku Café event seems to indicate that people will not just hoard them. The American student who spent 0.2 bitcoins didn’t cry for being overcharged. If anything, the true believers tend to be more generous as their way of seeing money has changed.  This year, shortly after an earthquake in Meishan, Sichuan Earthquake, Li Xiaolai organized a bitcoin donation. About 40 bitcoins were raised to help the quake victims. Like many bitcoiners, Li seeks to create a positive image for the community as charitable and responsible, rather than shady money grabbers or drug traffickers.  The event concluded on a hopeful note when the host proposed a bitcoin trade. Anyone could buy or sell their coins. One person offered to sell ten coins at a price one hundred yuan lower than the standard exchange rate that evening. The coins were quickly snapped up by two buyers.  It seems that bitcoiners don’t have the resistance to part with their coins that some economists see as the cryptocurrency’s biggest problem.

42425182,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv8Fh,1386254727,Bank of America: Bitcoin Has Clear Potential for Growth,"Bank of America has become the first US bank to talk openly about bitcoin, having issued a client note stating that the digital currency has “clear potential for growth”.  The news came in a 14-page note sent to clients by Bank of America currency strategist David Woo. He said he believes the maximum market cap of bitcoin is $15bn, or about 1,300 USD per 1 BTC.  In the note, Woo pointed out that bitcoin makes sense as a medium of exchange and has the potential to become a major means of payment for e-commerce. It could even emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers, Woo wrote.  It is interesting to note that Woo unambiguously identified e-commerce as a possible catalyst for growth. E-commerce and mobile commerce are slowly becoming more mainstream and even many traditional retailers are embracing the “click-and-mortar” business model, where they run both online and offline operations, which effectively blurs the line between e-tail and traditional retail.  Cross border e-commerce is also booming, particularly in the UK, so bitcoin could have a few more practical applications if it is embraced as an exchange medium, especially in certain markets.  However, Woo also pointed out that bitcoin could be used for other, unsavoury activates. He said bitcoin could be used to avoid tax, capital controls and confiscation. On the other hand, all bitcoin transactions are a matter of public record and every single bitcoin has a unique transaction history that cannot be changed, which could limit its use in the black market. After all, countries like Cyprus or Switzerland have banking laws that are far more suitable for money laundering than bitcoin.  Woo argued that bitcoin is not a bubble, provided it becomes a major force in e-commerce and money transfer. It also needs to become a “store of value with a reputation close to silver” to make it happen. Woo puts the maximum market cap of bitcoin at $15bn, or about 1,300 USD per 1 BTC.  Woo's market cap estimation is considerably more modest than the estimation voiced by the Winklevoss twins last month. The brothers, who are major investors in bitcoin after becoming wealthy from an early partnership with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, told CNBC that bitcoin's market cap could reach $400bn.

42422949,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yunh,1386249931,Microsoft Rival LibreOffice Accepts Bitcoin Donations,"The Document Foundation, the company that develops a free and openly-distributed productivity suite, LibreOffice, is now accepting bitcoin donations to help fund its operations.  It seems that the free and openly-distributed currency has garnered The Document Foundation increased visibility, as well as financial resources.  Italo Vignoli, one of the company's founders, reported a surge in bitcoin donations once it was announced that the non-profit organisation would accept the virtual currency.  He said that the site's total donations “registered a spike immediately after the announcement, with bitcoin being the most popular option for a couple of days”.  “After that timeframe, bitcoin has slowly slipped behind other options, although is still a visible source of donations,” he added.  Charitable donations  Although it does have a few corporate sponsors, The Document Foundation runs primarily on charitable donations.  “The entire LibreOffice project, with the exception of software development – which is backed by companies or by skilled volunteers, is based on donations.”  Donations allow the Document Foundation to disperse its resources in a number of ways.  “Money pays salaries, consultants, infrastructure, community development, marketing, certification, and other expenses such as travel to events,” Vignoli told CoinDesk.  The software is similar to Microsoft Office, Vignoli said. He added: “LibreOffice is the largest free software project targeted to the end-user. Its available on Windows, Mac OS and Linux and documents are standard and interoperable with Microsoft Office.”  According to The Document Foundation’s website: “it is an independent self-governing meritocratic entity, created by former leading members of the OpenOffice.org Community.”  Donations in bitcoin are on the rise, likely influenced by the currency's boost in price. A recent effort to raise money for Typhoon victims in the Philippines raised over $60,000 in bitcoin's current price.  Additionally, bitcoin entrepreneur Roger Ver recently made headlines by donating $1,000,000 to the Foundation for Economic Educations (FEE) after making a bet on bitcoin’s value over two years ago.  Tenets of bitcoin  “As a project, we are always looking for new sources of donations, and several project members pointed us to virtual currencies as a viable option,” says Vinoli.  It's clear from Vinoli that the aims of the Document Foundation echo the core tenets that bitcoin is built upon.  “Free software is a different way of building applications, based on collective - or distributed - intelligence. Although the community is huge, it is always looking for new and different ways to sustain the operational costs of the project through donations.”  The Document Foundation’s contribution page is located here.

42425180,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv8Jh,1386242717,German Police Detain 'Bitcoin Mining Hackers',"German police have detained two people suspected of hacking into computer networks and using them to mine over €700,000 worth of bitcoins. Three suspects face organised computer fraud and commercial fraud charges, according to the public prosecutor’s office in Kempten.  Two of the suspects were arrested Monday night in a raid by GSG-9, the German federal counter-terrorism unit. The raids were carried out in Bavaria and Lower Saxony, According to the Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany (BKA)  There was no arrest warrant against the third suspect, and it is somewhat unclear why federal authorities decided to employ a counter-terrorism unit to take down a handful of counterfeiters.  The group managed to create a bitcoin mining 'botnet' by modifying existing malware and letting it loose on the internet. The custom malware compromised several computer systems and gave them access to a powerful botnet. The malware also allowed the attackers to collect personal data from affected networks and computers.  BKA President Jorg Ziercke said the internet provides organised criminal groups with a new modus operandi that poses a great financial risk.  “In this case the perpetrators managed to generate virtual currency bitcoin through compromised computer systems. Digital currencies, like bitcoin, will be tracked by law enforcement agencies in the future. The relative anonymity of these currencies facilitates money laundering and minimizes risk of detection.”  The BKA estimates that the group illegally mined at least €700,000 worth of bitcoins. An extensive cache of evidence was seized in the raids. It also pointed to other criminal activities, including copyright violations and distribution of pornographic content.  Due to the ongoing nature of the investigation, the authorities could not release further press information.

42425171,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv83h,1386239033,Bitcoin Price Crashes as China Outlaws Bitcoin for Financial Institutions,"UPDATED on 5th December at 17:30 GMT  The price of bitcoin has climbed back up to $1,012, according to the Coindesk BPI.  ---------------------------------------------  The price of bitcoin fell by $300 on popular exchange Mt. Gox this morning after China's central bank warned financial institutions to steer clear of the digital currency.  According to the People’s Bank of China, it doesn't consider bitcoin a threat to China's financial system, but it does believe the digital currency carries significant risks.  “The concern is that it interferes with normal monetary policy operation,” Hao Hong, head of China research at Bocom International Holdings Co. in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg.  “It represents an unofficial leakage to the current monetary system and trades globally. It is difficult to regulate and could be used for money laundering. I think the central bank is right to make this move,"" he added.  On a positive note, the bank didn't ban trading platforms, such as BTC China, from dealing with bitcoin and other digital currencies, it merely said these companies have to register with authorities.  The trading platforms were also told that user anonymity is not permitted – the exchanges must receive identification documents from their customers. Plus, they must report any suspicious transactions to the authorities. The bank claims that this measure will “effectively prevent money laundering associated with bitcoin”.  The price  Although the bank clearly stated that it would allow individuals to freely use bitcoin, the announcement has already caused a massive price drop on several exchanges, namely BTC China. In heavy volume trading earlier this morning bitcoin lost roughly 10% of its value in a matter of hours.  The opening price on BTC China was 7,005 CNY, but it quickly shed more than 10%, with the lowest bid coming in at 4,521 CNY. At the time of writing, the latest price on CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index was $889.01, with a daily change of -22.5%, or $257.23.  The volume of transactions on BTC China spiked shortly after the bank's statement was published at 07:45 GMT. At this time, the volume of trades was 225.71 BTC, increasing by a massive 2975% to 6940.85 BTC over the next 45 minutes.  Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, said that, as he warned in his piece for CoinDesk last week, the Chinese regulatory situation has shifted unexpectedly, resulting in a significant negative impact on bitcoin’s price.  ""China is arguably the largest enforcer of financial repression and the paradox we observed there prior to today has, as expected, now been resolved,"" he added, going on to say:    “What was less clear last week is how much impact a sudden shift in China’s regulatory posture, and a large drop in the price of bitcoins traded in China, would have on the price of bitcoins traded outside of China.      Given the pullback we’ve observed in the Bitcoin Price Index it’s clear now that what happens in China also matters a lot outside China.”    Defining bitcoin and its risks  In a Q&A-style post on the bank's website, the institution said that it does not consider bitcoin a true currency. Roughly translated, it said:  ""Some people call bitcoin ""currency"", but because it is not issued by the monetary authorities, it is not truly money. Bitcoin is a virtual good, it does not have legal status and cannot and should not be used as currency in circulation in the market.""  Although the total value of bitcoins in circulation is dwarfed by national currencies, Chinese authorities seem to be taking the issue very seriously. Many Chinese citizens are investing their savings in bitcoin and some even argue they are basically hoarding the currency. This also represents a risk in terms of price fluctuations, as many speculators have no qualms about leaving the market at the first sign of trouble.  The post puts a heavy focus on the risks associated with digital currency, stating that the public currently lacks an adequate understanding of bitcoin.  It highlighted the volatility of the cryptocurrency as one of its biggest dangers plus outlined the potential of its use by criminals, hackers, illegal trading sites/scams and money launderers.  The bank is keen to prevent money laundering using bitcoin, so it is putting appropriate measures in place to target this kind of criminal activity.  The boom of bitcoin in China  Bitcoin has become extremely popular in China over the past few months, with some of the largest mining operations taking place there and BTC China becoming the world’s largest-volume bitcoin exchange.  Not only did BTC China beat Mt. Gox and Bitstamp to become the world’s highest volume bitcoin exchange, it recently secured $5m in funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners' local arm Lightspeed China to expand its operations further.  Also, back in May China surpassed all other countries in terms of downloads of the original bitcoin client, Bitcoin-Qt.  According to Bitnodes  , China is now home to the world’s second-highest number of bitcoin nodes with 14,100 online in September, which represented 11.3% of the global total.  This recent statement from the People’s Bank of China follows comments made on 22nd November by Yi Gang, the deputy governor of the bank, who said it would be impossible for China’s central bank to recognize bitcoin as a legal, legitimate financial instrument “in the near future”.  Perhaps more significantly, he added that people should be free to buy and sell bitcoins on exchanges with no interference from the central bank, and that he would personally look at the digital currency with a long-term perspective.  The price of bitcoin is likely to fluctuate throughout the day as those involved in the space try to figure out what exactly this new development means for bitcoin in the short- and long-term not just in China, but globally.
