42434971,tCVH4TQcT7YFJO3hckPQg2,1647816028,First Mover Asia: Singapore-Based Gaming Company Razer Struggles to Pivot; Bitcoin Declines After a Positive Week,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin holds over $41,000, despite a slight weekend drop; ether and most other major cryptos follow a similar pattern.  Insights: The one-time, would-be ""Apple of the Gaming World"" failed in its attempt to secure a digital banking license and to reinvent itself.  Technician's take: BTC's four-month-long downtrend could be nearing an end.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $41,246 -1.3%  Ether (ETH): $2,863 -1.8%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Ethereum Classic ETC +21.1% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin Cash BCH +2.7% Currency EOS EOS +1.7% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Polkadot DOT −3.3% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −2.9% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP −2.5% Computing  A slight drop after a good week  Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies fell slightly but finished a largely upbeat week higher than when they started the week, withstanding the U.S. central bank's first interest rate hike in four years and Russia's escalating attacks on Ukraine.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading about $41,200, off about 1.3% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin topped $42,000 late during U.S. trading hours Friday, a more than 7% increase from where it started the week as investors digested the long-expected Federal Reserve's 25-basis-point increase on Wednesday and global unrest tied to Russia's invasion. Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands a little under 2,900, a 1.8% drop over the same period, but well up from where it began the week. Most other major cryptos were in the red over the weekend. Trading volume fell over the past three days.  ""It's been a good week for bitcoin,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote to CoinDesk. ""We have been holding support above $40,500. If we can break through the next resistance line at $42,500, we could see a breakout to $45,000 as we saw in the last day of February.""  DiPasquale added that ""low trading volume is normal for weekend activity,"" and he expected it to increase during the week. ""With the equities markets rising again, there is a moment to be had in bitcoin, [ether] and other assets if Monday starts strong,"" he said.  The tech-focused Nasdaq rose 2% on Friday, while the S&P 500 was up a little over 1%. Gold fell 1.2%. The upswing in stocks and cryptos late in the week suggested that investors were willing to embrace more risk than they had been just a few days before.  The weekend saw a new round of atrocities in Ukraine and continued fallout that could undermine the already jittery, global economy. According to one report Mariupol, a strategic Black Sea port that would help Russia control the southern Ukraine coastline, was days away from falling. Meanwhile, a Wall Street Journal story Sunday said that Russia has largely failed so far to demonstrate that its economy could thrive in the face of fierce sanctions from countries opposed to its unprovoked attack, and would take years to achieve this objective.  DiPasquale noted that many investors have associated February's drop in equities and crypto markets with a similar decline in March 2020. ""While there was a lot of uncertainty, the wrong thing to do then was to sell low; the next two years saw historic rises,"" he said. ""Hedge funds like ours have a generally optimistic sentiment given the market's history of rising through uncertainty even after periods of turbulence.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,463 +1.1%  DJIA: 34,754 +0.7%  Nasdaq: 13,893 +2%  Gold: $1,919 -1.2%  Insights  Razer’s Efforts to Diversify Into Payments Still Overshadowed by Its Hardware  Razer (RAZFF) used to talk a big game about itself. The Singapore-based manufacturer of gaming PCs and peripherals was once called “the Apple of the gaming world.”  Some lapped it up, but industry analysts snickered as channel data showed the company didn’t really ship many PCs. Its keyboards, mice and other accessories were well received, but the PCs not so much.  Then, after its initial public offering (IPO), Razer became more modest. As part of the IPO it had to list how much it actually sold of its products. The results were underwhelming. While its competitors shipped tens of millions of gaming PCs and notebooks, Razer could barely muster 600,000, according to analysts and others who reviewed its earnings. For some models, the shipments were under 1,000.  Razer’s bark was louder than its bite.  As a listed company it was harder to throw around monikers like “Apple of the Gaming World,” so Razer needed to pivot. In 2020, its CEO, Min-Liang Tan, said that Razer was a “lifestyle brand” and the company put a larger emphasis on alternatives to selling PCs.  The company settled on payments and fintech to diversify, applying for one of Singapore’s coveted digital banking licenses. But regulators in Singapore declined Razer’s application, limiting it to payments, a cut-throat industry with thin margins. Of course, Razer could apply for a license somewhere other than Singapore, such as Malaysia, but so far it hasn’t made a move.  In late 2021, Razer decided to shutter its Razer Pay wallet service because it couldn’t carve out a meaningful niche in Southeast Asia’s crowded payments marketplace, dominated by super app Grab.  Razer still has a foot in the payments game, but its most recent earnings show that its efforts to move the company away from hardware and peripherals has stalled. At the end of the last fiscal year software and services contributed 10.6% to the company’s revenue. While the division’s raw revenue is up, overall it actually accounts for less, coming in at 10%.  Total payment volume for Razer Gold, its virtual credits service used to monetize games, is up 56% year on year as the coronavirus pandemic continues to keep people inside and gaming. Razer's fintech arm, which provides merchant services, hit $7 billion in revenue for 2021, up 63.5%.  Theoretically, GameFi would take a big bite out of Razer Gold as a way to monetize and finance games. When asked about this a PR rep directed CoinDesk to a statement in the earnings report from Razer’s CEO, which said the company intends to “explore decentralized finance” but otherwise said nothing concrete.  Shareholders don’t care. The stock is a catastrophe, especially in the pandemic era when investors put a premium on anything to do with gaming and PCs as locked-down consumers spend more in this segment as a way to entertain themselves and stay productive.  Since its listing in Hong Kong in 2017 the stock is down nearly 47%. This is incredible when compared to its peers. Logitech (LOGI), which makes PC peripherals for productivity and gaming, is up nearly 110% during the same time period; Taiwan’s MSI, a well-known gaming PC manufacturer; is up 90%; and Corsair (CRSR), which listed in late 2020, is up by around 40%.  Part of this might be because Razer is actually a fairly small company, despite its cult following. Net profits for the year were around $43.4 million. Last fiscal year it was a mere $800,000.  Razer’s future appears to be as a private company (there was talk about a U.S.-listing, but that would devolve into meme stock territory) as investors move towards de-listing it from the Hong Kong exchange through a buyout. That might be the best move because investors don’t seem to be too enthusiastic about Razer as a PC gaming company or even a payments company.     Technician's take  Bitcoin Holding Above $40K, Resistance at $46K  Bitcoin (BTC) buyers remain active after maintaining support at $37,000 over the past two weeks. The cryptocurrency is up 7% over the past week and could see further upside toward the $43,000-$46,000 resistance zone.  Short-term momentum signals have turned upward, especially after a downside exhaustion signal appeared on March 7. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising above oversold levels (above 50), suggesting the four-month-long downtrend in price is nearing an end.  Still, there is significant overhead resistance on the charts, which could stall the current price bounce.

42410902,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt3o2,1647787800,Revisiting Bitcoin’s Energy ‘Problem’ in the Face of ESG Investment Mandates,"I get really animated when discussing Bitcoin’s energy use. And by “Bitcoin’s energy use,” I mean the amount of energy bitcoin mining uses. I tend to say Bitcoin’s energy use isn’t a problem and that we should instead focus on Bitcoin’s emissions. [Note: we capitalize the blockchain (Bitcoin) and use lowercase or trading symbols (bitcoin/BTC) for the asset.]  Before diving into any details, it’s important to make clear what bitcoin (BTC) mining is and why it needs to use a lot of energy. Mining is the mechanism that sustains the financial infrastructure of the Bitcoin network and it is energy intensive by design to provide ironclad security.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  The comparison game  In a casual setting, my favorite way to showcase that Bitcoin’s energy use “doesn’t matter” is to append Bitcoin’s energy use to the U.S.’s energy consumption and ask if it looks like Bitcoin is using too much energy (see below).  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  Using this graphic, it looks like the U.S. has an energy problem and, given China consumes 79% more energy than the U.S., China has an even bigger energy problem. Bitcoin only uses an estimated 134 TWh of energy per year, a scant 1.9% and 3.5% that China and the U.S. consume annually. You can imagine the path the rest of the conversation takes.  I included this graphic to illustrate that the comparison game is usually a waste of time. Bitcoiners often do this unproductively, comparing bitcoin mining energy consumption to Christmas light energy consumption or the like, and leaving the argument at that (Christmas lights do use a lot of energy, however). I even did it in a report I published last April comparing it to video games.  Read more: Does Bitcoin Have an Energy Problem?  I probably committed a cardinal sin in that report by trying to convince the reader that Bitcoin’s energy use was “worth it” because Bitcoin is a “global, trustless, permissionless payment settlement network and a digital, aspirational store of value.” Let’s save the morality lecture for another time and instead assume, for sake of argument, that Bitcoin is worth using energy.  Why does bitcoin mining need to use energy?  The shortest answer is that Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator, thought the best way to fairly distribute bitcoins was by creating a system in which miners exchange something valuable – energy – for the right to claim the bitcoins (the shortest shortest answer is actually “anti-spam”).  A longer answer should add something about the need to ward off attackers if you want to successfully decentralize trust in a network. Mining is energy-intensive so that it is prohibitively expensive to attack Bitcoin. Remember: Mining doesn’t use energy to validate transactions; energy consumption is the price exacted for securing the entire network.  The preceding point about transaction validation is important because it is enticing to compare the energy density of Bitcoin transactions to something like Visa (V). Bitcoin can only handle seven transactions per second compared to Visa’s 24,000+. But, remember, Bitcoin doesn’t use energy to validate transactions. The miners’ job is to secure the network, add new blocks of data to the chain and win bitcoin in return. That’s what they spend energy on. They’re not primarily interested in validating transactions. That consensus on the true state of the network is primarily the job of non-mining, Bitcoin full nodes. Plus, Bitcoin transactions are not the same as Visa or other payment processors’ transactions. Bitcoin transactions provide (probabilistic) finality, Visa’s don’t. Visa’s success depends on the success of separate systems. Visa’s “token” is not native to its network.  Let’s talk about Bitcoin’s emissions instead  A growing number of institutions have recognized the importance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and have implemented internal mandates. Ignoring the “SG” for a moment (although they are immensely important and relevant to Bitcoin), it makes sense from an investment perspective to consider the environmental impact of Bitcoin’s energy use.  Bitcoin’s environmental impact has more to do with the greenhouse gas emissions (mainly carbon) associated with the production of the energy used for mining and less to do with the absolute amount of energy it consumes. We’ll consider renewable energy sources like solar, hydro and wind power as “clean” given their relatively low carbon density (ignoring their negative externalities for now). The cleaner the energy mix, the smaller the environmental impact.  A common environmental critique against bitcoin mining was that most miners were in China (>80% in February 2020), a country highly dependent on coal-fired energy (although Chinese miners used a surprising amount of clean energy). When China banned crypto mining in May 2021, miners left for the U.S., Kazakhstan and Russia. Time will tell whether those miners will settle on using clean energy sources, but they seem largely set on doing so, at least in the U.S..  In the report I wrote last year, I relied on research published by Cambridge University to support the position that bitcoin mining uses a respectable percentage of renewables in its energy mix. The 2020 study suggested that 39% of total energy for Bitcoin mining came from renewable sources in 2019 (compared to 28% in 2018) with 76% of miners using renewable sources as part of their energy mix.  Since then, the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), a forum of Bitcoin miners aimed at promoting energy usage transparency, sharing best practices and educating the broader public on the benefits of Bitcoin and bitcoin mining, has shared data that suggests 58.5% of global bitcoin mining uses renewable energy (66.1% for BMC members). That’s relatively clean. It is worth noting that inclusion in the BMC is entirely optional, so there might be some social-desirability response bias to sort through in their survey data.  Where do we go from here?  There were plenty of other ESG related topics I could have covered in this like how bitcoin mining could incentivize more renewable energy generation, improve electrical grid intermittency, revitalize local economies, empower oft-forgotten communities, or act as a “load balancing economic battery.” In reality bitcoin mining and its energy use is a complicated, multidisciplinary topic. By way of example, my view is that an investment in Bitcoin could be considered an investment in ESG, given its potential impact on energy generation. This column on its own doesn’t represent a full defense of that thesis because there are so many angles that weren’t considered.  At the very least, I hope this inspires more discussions about Bitcoin’s true energy cleanliness and broader impact.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/20/revisiting-bitcoins-energy-problem-in-the-face-of-esg-investment-mandates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1cc7b538e81cc96967b87e1b6305e8b19a660d11-4195x2802.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fact that they translate machine-readable addresses to human-readable ones is probably the greatest value addition. What can ENS be used for? Okay, so most cryptocurrencies work on the basis of a public key and a private key. While the private key is used to communicate cryptographically, the public key serves as your address. Consider your public key to be similar to your home address or email address. You want to share it with people who are willing to pay you. Perhaps you&apos;re out for coffee with a friend, and they want to repay you. They&apos;d need your public keys to do so. The problem is that the public key isn&apos;t something you can simply utter out loud. It&apos;s quite long and consists of a slew of seemingly random digits and letters. This was an issue. Instead of reading aloud 64 numbers and characters and praying that your friend hears them all right in a noisy café, or emailing him your public key, you can simply tell him your ENS address, which may be as simple as abccrypto.ens. You might inform them that the ENS name server will check your friend&apos;s genuine address and that whoever registered ABC Crypto hs Ens will receive the money they are attempting to send. This is critical in overcoming the psychological barriers that prevent people from adopting cryptocurrency.
