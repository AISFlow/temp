42385657,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB37YJ,1611009956,CoinShares to Launch a Bitcoin ETP on SIX Swiss Exchange,"Digital asset management firm CoinShares announced Monday it’s launching an exchange-traded bitcoin product (ETP) on Swiss stock exchange SIX, according to a Bloomberg report.    The ETP will go live on Jan. 19 and will be listed under the ticker BITC.  Bitcoin ETPs provide exposure to bitcoin in a regulated asset class. In contrast to the U.S., where regulators have been loathe to sign off on bitcoin ETF applications, there are already several entities offering crypto-backed products across Europe.  The product’s assets will be custodied by Komainu, a venture that launched about a year ago involving Nomura Holdings, CoinShares and Ledger.  BITC will charge a 0.98% expense ratio and will be physically backed by bitcoin.  Just last week, digital asset-backed securities developer ETC Group announced it would list a physically backed bitcoin ETP on SIX.  ETC Group was the 34th ETP provider on the exchange, making CoinShares the 35th.

A former Canadian prime minister said bitcoin could become a global reserve currency, Goldman Sachs is reportedly looking to get into the crypto custody business and MetLife is bullish on CBDCs.    Top shelf    Goldman Sachs jumping in? Its crypto custody plans will be “evident soon,” according to an internal source. CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported the major investment bank has issued a request for information to explore digital asset custody, though it is not interested in becoming a prime broker. Last week crypto-native Anchorage attained conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to become a national digital bank.      Updating the base Coinbase, a bellwether for bull runs because the exchange is likely to go down during periods of heavy volatility, is updating its infrastructure to prevent outages. It will also bring on more customer support. Coinbase has sent smoke signals about going public this year, though it has not yet filed.      Digital 'belt and road' China’s Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) – a permissioned blockchain network for building decentralized applications and tokens – will test a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as early as the second half of 2021, according to a Jan. 15 blog post. Moreover, the network looks to become a blockchain of blockchains with a total of 30 public blockchain integrations slated for this year.

(Decrypt)  BITCOIN RESURGENCE: Nic Carter explains. (New York)  Market intel    Linked to bitcoin? LINK, the native token of the Chainlink oracle system, has hit a fresh all-time high as bitcoin trades sideways. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole called LINK’s new high at $23.68 (the previous lifetime high of $19.90 was reached in August,) set in overnight trading. LINK is just one of many altcoins that are benefiting from consolidation in bitcoin markets and a rotation of capital into more speculative bets, Godbole reports.    At stake    Trilemma dilemma? MetLife is the latest legacy financial institution to take a hard look at cryptocurrency. In a primer titled “The Blockchain Blockbuster,” MetLife Investment Management (MIM), the life insurance giant’s investment wing, examined the nature of money from “Yapese stones to central bank digital currencies.”      My colleague Will Foxley reported that MIM thinks CBDCs are anything but “a passing fad,” (MIM’s words) and represent the “logical progression of money and technology"" (Foxley’s words). “[J]ust as the dreams of cryptocurrency developers tend to be rather lofty, so are those of various CBDC initiatives,"" the document states.      The 18-page report, published Jan. 8, didn’t say much more than that. It argued that interest in CBDC development was spurred by the explosion of digital assets unleashed after Bitcoin came on the scene. And concluded by saying “western countries” could potentially look towards China’s digital yuan experiment as a guide. Neither points are really debatable, but debate we must!      There is one smaller point worth examining. While Alexander Villacampa and Jun Jiang, the paper’s authors, appear to think CBDCs and cryptocurrencies can (and will) exist side-by-side, there was a moment of existential conflict. I quote:      “Bitcoin and its ilk are constantly battling to maintain a balance between three key concerns known as the 'Blockchain Trilemma.' The trilemma, often visualized as a triangle, consists of three issues related to sustainable public blockchain development: scalability, decentralization, and security. It is assumed in the trilemma that by strengthening any one of the triangle’s vertices, at least one of the others must weaken.”      The “scalability trilemma,” attributed to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, is a (often constructive) criticism of blockchain networks. Although it’s fallen out of “the discourse” in recent years – a quick Google search showed that the problem was often used as a marketing tool for blockchains that supposedly solved the issue in 2018 – plenty of smart people are still thinking about it.      Called the trilemma, the concept can actually be reduced even further to a sliding scale of decentralization and centralization, with pros and cons of moving between the two. It posits developers can’t have everything when it comes to efficiency and security. Optimizing for decentralization naturally makes the network slower, though more secure. Centralization reduces security, by introducing a single entity that can be attacked, but improves transaction throughput. Simple enough!      But is it right? In 2018, in the heyday of the trilemma, most people cited Bitcoin and Ethereum’s proof-of-work consensus algorithm (the networks’ security design) as prime examples of how decentralization reduces transaction throughput. Thousands of miners create a secure, but slow, network.      Bitcoin developers are looking at layer 2 solutions, like Lightning, to create a usable payments system out of a secure base, while Ethereum developers are exploring layer 2s and a network overhaul. In many of these instances the solution is moving and processing some transactions off-chain, limiting how much a decentralized blockchain can get in the way.      While it’s clear that the contours of the trilemma are real and should be addressed, the real solution is probably to ignore the framing. The tradeoff between scalability and security is a problem that exists across the payments universe. Bitcoin is cumbersome though accessible to anyone, and Visa is lightning-fast but entirely prone to “financial censorship.”      This isn’t to take the Bitcoin Maximalist view that bitcoin is a store of value and doesn’t need to be a payments system, but it is an admission that there’s room in the world for multiple types of systems that all optimize for different things.      Circling back to CBDCs, as Villacampa and Jiang note, the “expansion of electronic payment systems via blockchain technology that has captured the interest of central banks who believe they are uniquely capable of providing not only a better alternative but also able to lay the foundation for an officially-sanctioned global electronic payments regime.” If that includes researchers that think they’ve solved the “scalability trilemma,” more power to them.

Speaking at an event on Jan. 12, Kress said if demand in the cryptocurrency market picks up to a ""meaningful"" level, the company could again start selling the specialized cards called CMPs, according to a SeekingAlpha transcription.  CMPs are GPUs with the video outputs removed, allowing them to be made and sold more cheaply.  Currently, Nvidia's RTX 30-Series GPUs are popular with miners, though Kress said, ""We don’t believe [mining demand is] a big part of our business today.""  However, ""gaming demand is very strong, and we think that’s larger than our current supply,"" she said.  With the RTX 30-Series supply to stay tight until at least the end of Q1 2021, relaunching CMPs could alleviate pressure on the consumer product line.  While bitcoin miners use specialized and more costly processors called ASICs, other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum's ether can be mined with GPUs.

Announced Tuesday, customers of Huobi’s over-the-counter (OTC) platform will be able to settle transactions instantly in euros and pounds (GBP) via BCB’s BLINC network.  Cryptocurrency exchanges have struggled in recent years to secure banking relationships and establish an interface with the fiat currency world, with some large exchanges having massive daily volume in closed systems of crypto-to-crypto trading. Prior to partnering with BCB, Huobi did not have a European fiat gateway, said Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, founder and CEO of BCB Group.  “We’re here to provide that robust infrastructure so that these guys can just get on with trading and know that trades are happening in a way that’s properly monitored, that’s regulatory-friendly,” Landsberg-Sadie said in an interview.  The bar is high and Huobi had to jump through a few significant hoops. The whole process took some time to complete, he added.  “We understand the importance of both a compliant and streamlined service,” Ciara Sun, Huobi’s head of global business, said in a statement. “Partnering with BCB allows us to offer a European fiat on- and off-ramping service that we know is in line with the laws of that area, but it also allows our customers in Europe to experience a smooth and hassle-free user experience.”  Read more: Investors Can Now Trade Ether and British Pounds on the Same Blockchain  BCB, which started out as an over-the-counter desk, partnered with U.K.-based Clearbank, as well as some other European banks, to facilitate crypto-to-fiat on/off ramps.

Huobi joins Bitstamp, the other large exchange taking advantage of BCB’s BLINC payment network. BCB also works with Coinbase and Kraken, but those exchanges are not part of BLINC.

In an interview with Cambridge House’s Jay Martin on Sunday, Harper acknowledged the U.S. dollar had been on a downtrend but said there were few viable international alternatives, even when looking at the euro and the yuan.      “Unless the U.S. becomes a catastrophe, it’s hard to see what the alternative is to the U.S. dollar as the world’s major reserve currency. Other than you know gold, bitcoin [and] a whole basket of things, right?"" said Harper. ""I think you’ll see that the number of things that people use as reserves will expand, but the U.S. dollar will still be the bulk of it.”      Harper stressed he is not an expert when it comes to digital currencies, but said it is hard to see how they operate as a store of value – something ""pretty critical"" for a currency.      The former Conservative prime minister explained that every currency has three purposes: as a medium of exchange, as a unit of account and as a store of value.

42385662,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB37c5,1610976232,"Chainlink Hits Record High, Altcoins Rally Amid Bitcoin Consolidation","Decentralized oracle network Chainlink's LINK token and other prominent alternative cryptocurrencies (dubbed altcoins) are charting solid gains as the crypto market leader bitcoin takes a bull breather.      LINK set a new record price of $23.68 overnight and is changing hands near $21.73 at press time, a 7.3% gain on a 24-hour basis. The previous lifetime high of $19.90 was reached in August, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The cryptocurrency has nearly doubled in the first two weeks of the year in a strong follow-through to last year's 530% rise. Chainlink's oracles act as a bridge between cryptocurrency smart contracts and off-chain data feeds.      Some altcoins such as OMG and OXT are up over 10% in the past 24 hours, while others including ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash have gained at least 2%–8% each.      Bitcoin is currently trading near $36,900, representing a 5% gain in 24 hours, but remains trapped in a week-long tightening range of $30,000 to $40,000. The period of consolidation looks to be paving the way for the rotation of money into the relatively cheap altcoins.      The switch to alts began last week with Polkadot blockchain's DOT token rallying sharply to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of cryptocurrency framework Equilibrium and the EOSDT stablecoin. ""Other coins now seem to be following Polkadot higher,"" he said.      The record ether-bitcoin implied volatility spread seen earlier this month had suggested a rally in ether and alternative cryptocurrencies in general may be on the way.      Altcoins could continue to ""pop hard"" while bitcoin is held in a narrowing price range, said market analyst Lark Davis on Twitter.      Also read: Bitcoin Struggles to Recover After Biggest Weekly Price Loss Since September      LINK may receive an additional boost from Ethereum's impending switch to the staking model, which would allow node operators to stake their collateral in order to gain access to certain data jobs that require collateral.      The altcoin rally may pause if bitcoin's recent narrowing price range ends with a bullish breakout, opening doors for stronger gains.

Allan Flynn has started proceedings against Westpac and ANZ banks at the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which closed his accounts soon after they had been opened, reports the Australian Financial Review.  Flynn had operated a digital currency exchange registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), but said he was unable to continue operating without banking services.  The trader said he purchased bitcoin on behalf of 450 customers via his business, but over three years had around 20 accounts closed by banks, including CBA, NAB, ING and Bendigo Bank.  Westpac reportedly told Flynn his account was closed because it was “under investigation for cryptocurrency fraud.”  “How am I supposed to run a lawful business if I can’t get a bank account?” Flynn told the Australian Financial Review.  According to the report, he also claimed an ANZ employee had informed other banks and his customers that he was involved in fraud.

42385663,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB37eb,1610968490,Bitcoin Struggles to Recover After Biggest Weekly Price Loss Since September,"Bitcoin is up only slightly on Monday after seeing its biggest weekly decline in over four months.      At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading 0.2% higher on the day near $35,838, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Prices fell by 6% in the seven days leading up to Jan. 17, a weekly fall not seen since the first week of September.      Bitcoin took a beating a week ago, falling from $40,000 to $30,305 in a matter of few hours, mainly due to heavy selling in the spot market. The cryptocurrency spent the rest of the week trimming losses and tested $40,000 at one point before ending the week (Sunday, UTC) just under $36,000.      The quick recovery from $30,305 amid the continued accumulation by whales paints a bullish longer-term picture. The options market is also biased bullish, with the Jan. 29 $52,000 call option attracting good demand in the past few days.      However, it may be too early to call an end of the bull market correction, as the cryptocurrency is still trapped in a narrowing price range or triangle pattern on the hourly chart, according to Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG.      A move above the top end of the triangle pattern would confirm a breakout and imply a continuation of the broader uptrend.      However, as per Heusser, a rally to a fresh all-time high above $41,962 would offer more credible evidence of a bull revival. That hinges on the pace of institutional inflows, strategists at JPMorgan said in a note Friday.      ""The flow into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust would likely need to sustain its $100 million per day pace over the coming days and weeks for such a breakout [above $40,000] to occur,"" the strategists wrote.      Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the biggest publicly traded crypto investment trust, reopened last Tuesday after a month-long break. Since then, the trust has accumulated at least 4,700 BTC, according to the Twitter-based GBTC Bitcoin Tracker. If accurate, that's $171 million worth of purchases in six days, significantly less than JPMorgan's required daily average of $100 million.      Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.      Also read: Crypto Long & Short: No, Bitcoin Is Not in a Bubble      Global stock markets are trading on a weak note on Monday, while the U.S. dollar is gaining ground against major currencies. The stronger greenback could hurt bitcoin's price, as discussed last week.      A potential triangle breakdown could pave the way for a re-test of the last week's low of $30,305.

According to a report by local media outlet Tasmin News Agency on Sunday, 45,000 mostly application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) machines were confiscated.  The powerful machines had purportedly been consuming 95 megawatts per hour of electricity at a reduced rate, according to Tavanir's head Mohammad Hassan Motavalizadeh.

In July of last year, Iran penned a registration directive forcing miners to disclose their identities.

Cryptocurrency lender Genesis Capital and institutional cryptocurrency firm CMS Holdings also participated in the round.      According to a press statement shared with CoinDesk, the Maps.me wallet is expected to ""unlock DeFi tools"" for its 140 million users by allowing them to access a range of payment and investment tools.      “By embedding and democratizing access to yield-earning finance to millions of users via an everyday app, Maps.me has the potential to really propel DeFi mainstream adoption,"" said Alameda Research CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

Users will also be able to send and spend money in multiple currencies for cross-border travel, offer cashback on transactions and exchange funds without hidden costs, per the statement.      With its wallet offering, the travel platform said it's aiming to combat high foreign exchange fees and commissions charged by banks and third-party travel booking providers.
