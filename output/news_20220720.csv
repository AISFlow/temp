Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  BEE4, a Brazil-based fintech company, plans to launch the first local marketplace of tokenized stocks in the next few weeks, BEE4 CEO Patricia Stille told CoinDesk on Tuesday.  The company plans to replicate the structure of a stock exchange and will allow Brazilian companies with annual revenue between $1.8 million and $55 million to make public offerings of up to $19 million.  Last September, BEE4 was chosen by the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) to participate in a regulatory sandbox, along with SMU, a secondary crowdfunding market, and QR Vórtx, a tokenizer issuing bonds and credit rights investment funds.  Read more: Brazilian Congress Postpones Crypto Bill Vote Until After October Presidential Elections  According to Stille, investments in early stage companies have been reserved for large funds or investors with large amounts of capital and access to private rounds. “BEE4 comes to give general investors access to this,” she said.  The BEE4 platform will offer buy and sell orders, an open bid book, a trading floor and auctions. It will run on the Quorum network, based on the Ethereum blockchain, on which companies will tokenize their public offerings, Stille said.  Asset tokenization is a hot area in Brazil. In December, Brazil’s only stock exchange, B3, said it was exploring opportunities in the asset tokenization, digital asset custody and crypto-as-a-service (CaaS) segments. And last week, Itaú Unibanco, Brazil's largest private bank, announced its plans to launch an asset tokenization platform that transforms traditional finance products into tokens.

The assets which have always served as a safe haven for investors when it comes to the high volatility of the crypto market had seen a drawdown coming into the new year. As a result of this, for the first time, these stablecoins are now seeing a reversal of their otherwise bullish growth trend over the last couple of years. Stablecoins See Market Cap Plummet Stablecoins had grown tremendously throughout the bull market of 2021. By the end of the year, the year-over-year growth of the stablecoin market cap had actually come out to a total of $151.3 billion. This growth is attributed to the popularity among investors who were holding their funds in stablecoins, either from profits or waiting to buy more cryptocurrencies. Related Reading | Bitcoin Dominance Dives As Ethereum Takes Up More Space The top stablecoins had enjoyed most of this growth. Assets such as USDT and USDC saw their market caps grow by double-digits in billions, although they continued to fiercely compete with one another. This competition would, however, come out in the favor of USDC. Most of the support had sprung from the fact that USDC had more regulatory oversight compared to USDT, whose reserves continue to be questioned even to this day. The year 2022 would prove to not be a good one for USDT too. It had come into the new year with more than $78 billion. But in the first half of the year alone, it has lost more than $12 billion to be sitting at its current market of a little over $66 billion at the time of this writing. Stablecoin supply drops | Source: Arcane Research USDC, on the other hand, is enjoying much success even through the bear market. Its market cap has added more than $10 billion this year alone, growing from $42.2 billion to $55.31 billion at the time of this writing. The Crash Of UST A major factor behind the decline in the stablecoin market cap has been the crash of UST. By the beginning of this year, it was the largest and most popular algorithmic stablecoin, which is why the crash shook the market to the extent that it did. Related Reading | Ethereum Classic (ETC) Reclaims $3 Billion Market Cap, More Upside To Follow? Since then, the market cap of algorithmic stablecoins has dropped from $13.26 billion to around $3 billion. UST alone accounted for more than 94% of the decline after the crash, wiping off $9.7 billion from the crash. There was the crash of other algorithmic stablecoins such as DEI, but UST’s popularity and size made it the most prominent. USDT market cap drops to $66B | Source: Market Cap USDT on TradingView.com This has understandably led to reluctance on the part of crypto investors when it comes to using algorithmic stablecoins. As such, stablecoins such as USDT, USDC, and BUSD continue cot rule the market. However, the total stablecoin supply has been down 35.8% over the last six months. This can be regarded as a good thing, given that an increase in supply can often lead to a decline in value and vice versa.

For the first time in more than a month, Bitcoin exceeded the $24,000 threshold. Investors can exhale with relief after nearly three months of “extreme fear.” On Wednesday, BTC reached a record high of $24,120, increasing by 8% in only one day and trading at levels not seen since mid-June. TradingView reports that the price of one bitcoin is currently $24,120.30. The trading volume over a 24-hour period is $49.929,803,913. The value of Bitcoin has climbed by 7.97% over the previous day. BTC/USD trades above $24k. Source: TradingView Bitcoin investors hope that the Fed will adopt a more accommodating approach at its following policy meeting. Risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies have been considerably impacted by the US central bank’s tightening monetary policy. Since the beginning of 2022, the price of bitcoin has decreased steadily by about 50%. After an incredible 73 days, BTC finally left the “extreme fear” zone on Wednesday. The increase is related to BTC’s weekly gain of 19%. As bulls get back into the market, the trend restarts.

When the price of a cryptocurrency rises above $22,700, it has regained its 200-week moving average and laid the technical foundation for a “trend reversal.” In the meantime, traders are betting that the worst of a severe market panic caused by issues with liquidity at several significant crypto businesses has passed. Matt Weller, global head of market research at Forex.com wrote: “Like many risk assets, the crypto market is benefitting from investors ratcheting down their expectations for the Fed’s peak interest rate this cycle to around 3.75% around the end of the year.” The current bear market, however, may last for another 250 days, according to Grayscale’s “Bear Markets in Perspective” report.

Tesla +4% on earnings ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ pic.twitter.com/coOFjpsOqy — TradingView (@tradingview) July 20, 2022 The Elon Musk-led company purchased Bitcoin in 2021. At that time, BTC’s price was losing steam as it traded around its current levels, but when Tesla announced its decision, the cryptocurrency was able to rally into uncharted territory. The company purchased BTC as a corporate strategy to hedge against inflation and as a tool to potentially increased its cash flow. Thus, why it is important to understand the reasons behind this BTC sale. According to Wittgenstein, there are three potential scenarios, the company needed to raise cash, there are climate concerns about BTC alleged energy consumption, or a total loss of faith in the cryptocurrency. The first scenario is the most bullish, and the last the most bearish. Why Did Tesla Sold Its Bitcoin? Founder at NorthmanTrader Sven Henrich believes Tesla followed a corporate strategy when the price of Bitcoin dropped below $20,000. The company forced itself to liquidate a portion of its assets to maintain its cash flow. Henrich said: In trading terms: $TSLA got itself margin called and liquidated a large chunk of its digital asset portfolio to make itself free cash flow positive & improve its balance sheet.

According to a recent blog post, the company filed the paperwork on July 8. “The management has decided that, in light of the current circumstances, it would be in the best interests of all stakeholders (including creditors) to file the Application for a moratorium order … This is so as to give Defi Payments [its Singapore entity] and the Vauld management the breathing space it requires to prepare for the intended restructuring for the benefit of all stakeholders.”  Vauld says it continues to be in talks with Nexo, which earlier in July inked a term sheet with Vauld for a possible purchase, subject to a 60-day due diligence period.  The crypto lender – which counts Peter Thiel, Pantera Capital, and Coinbase Ventures among its investors – owes $402 million to its creditors, with 90% of that debt originating from individual retail investor deposits, a July 8 affidavit filed by Vauld co-founder and CEO Darshan Bathija revealed.  A Singaporean moratorium order is similar to an American Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, with both proceedings allowing companies to avoid liquidations and continue operations.

42422668,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0oRXh,1658351438,Bank of America Survey's Extreme Pessimism Might Be Contrarian Indicator,"An old Wall Street mantra says when investors collectively feel worse and hold cash, most of the price drop has already happened. Then, selling stalls, eventually paving the way for a new bull run.  Bank of America's monthly fund manager survey, conducted between July 8 and July 15, shows dire levels of investor pessimism and increased preference for cash. And bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of life along with stocks. The leading cryptocurrency by market value peeped above $24,000 early today, claiming the highest price since June 13.  However, crypto market pundits are divided on whether extreme negative sentiment implies a bear market bottom and a renewed bull run in risk assets, including bitcoin.  Bank of America's survey, which included 259 participants with $722 billion under management, showed fund managers' allocation to stocks plunged to the lowest since October 2008, while cash holdings surged to a 21-year high of 6.1% from 5.6% a month ago, pushing risk exposure below levels seen following the crash of Lehman Brothers in 2008.  Further, long U.S. dollar, long oil and short stocks were crowded trades alongside persistent fear of stagflation and increased expectations for an economic recession. What's more, BofA's Bull and Bear Indicator remained ""max bearish.""  According to liquidity provider Folkvang Trading's Chief Investment Officer Jeff Anderson, the survey result indicating extreme pessimism and defensive positioning in safe havens like the dollar is a contrary indicator – the one that tells you it might be a good time to step away from the herd and invest in risky assets.  ""It's a case of overstretched positions in thin, illiquid markets which yields bad data, good price,"" Anderson said.  The bad news is increasingly becoming good news for markets. Both stocks and bitcoin have found a footing in the past seven days. The dollar has come under pressure as recession fears, and the drop in commodity prices have eased inflation concerns and the possibility of bigger and faster rate hikes by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value, against major fiat currencies, has dropped 2.6% to 106.94 since July 14.  However, Dick Lo, founder and CEO of TDX Strategies, said, ""The BofA survey results are consistent with the backdrop of rampant inflation and monetary policy tightening across the globe, and so extreme pessimism can prevail for a prolonged period before the market bottoms out.""  Lo warned that the ongoing bounce in risk assets is countercyclical and could be fleeting given the macro overhang and favored downside protection strategies, such as hedging long positions with a put option, offering insurance against price drops.  And Lo may be right. While the recent decline in energy and commodity prices may pull down inflation, the Fed is unlikely to ditch its hawkish stance unless there is a marked decline in inflation metrics.  According to BofA's survey, the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, needs to drop below 4% for the central bank to turn dovish. The core PCE stood at 6.3% on a yearly basis in May.  Further, the central bank may want to see a marked decline in the headline consumer price index (CPI), which includes the volatile food and energy component, before pulling the plug on policy tightening. The spending habits of so-called main street, representing average Americans, are more sensitive to the changes in the headline CPI.  Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said record pessimism might be a contrary indicator; however, corporate earnings will likely have the final say in determining how pessimistic the market has become compared to the economic reality.  In other words, risk appetite could return if corporate earnings show underlying strength in the world's largest economy. According to FactSet data quoted by Market Watch, about 10% of the S&P 500 companies have reported earnings so far this quarter, and 69% of those have topped analyst expectations.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/20/bank-of-america-surveys-extreme-pessimism-might-be-contrarian-indicator,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42422673,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0oRbh,1658351098,Outside Magazine Wants the Metaverse to Take a Hike,"If bragging rights alone can’t motivate your sorry ski bum out of bed for that sweet, sweet 20th day on the slopes, then Robin Thurston, CEO of Outside Magazine’s parent company, has a novel idea that might.  He calls it the “Outerverse”: A platform where hikers, bikers, runners, skiers – outdoor-doers the world over – can earn rewards for tracking their real-life activity atop crypto rails. Skiers, for example, could unlock chances at a heli-skiing expedition, Zoom calls with famous photographers, perhaps Warren Miller movie tickets – definitely non-fungible tokens (NFT) – by notching days out on the snow.  Outside Interactive, the conglomerate behind Outside Magazine and a raft of outdoor journalism outposts from Backpacker to Climbing, as well as fitness lifestyle brands such as Yoga Journal, is leaning into Web3 with an “anti-metaverse” NFT platform. The aim is to give readers incentive to spend more time among the trees rather than vegetating in VR.  “Our underlying goal is to get people outside,” said Thurston. “This sort of convergence of technology, you know, Web3 culture – you can’t ignore.”  The newly launched Web3 gambit – it commenced this week with sales of 10,000 Outerverse “passport” NFTs for 5 SOL (or a roughly $225) a pop – is one front in Outside’s wider battle for supremacy and relevancy on the outdoor media market’s digital stage. Reader desires are changing, Thurston told CoinDesk. Niche magazines just don’t command the audience they once did.  Whether an NFT-yielding platform that rewards readers for going outside will command such a pull is the big question now. Thurston certainly thinks so. He sees no issue with Outside’s blending of cryptotech and crunchy granola.  In a few months, its Outerverse will start pulling data from fitness-tracking apps; users whose stats pass a certain performance benchmark get access to experiences as well as NFT drops from creators such as photographers and videographers. They’ll be able to sell their NFT-ified creations to consumers through the Outerverse marketplace, too.  A beaten path  It might seem a little odd to leverage tech that flourished during COVID-19 lockdowns as incentive to get outside. But it's not without precedent. Solana-based fitness game Stepn sees thousands of NFT-holding runners track their jogs with GPS in exchange for tokens. Web2 running platforms such as Strava also gets people moving via social competition.  Thurston said the Outerverse picked the Solana blockchain for its energy efficiency (Ethereum, where most NFTs live, remains until the Merge an electricity guzzler – a big no-no for an outside-oriented project). To further offset the Outerverse’s footprint, Outside will buy carbon credits, he said.  The Outerverse’s “Outside to Earn” model is a lot less chain-heavy than Stepn’s “Move to Earn” mishmash of rights-bearing NFTs and token payouts, said Kevin Chou, who helped build the former with his Web3 venture studio, SuperLayer.  Read more: Learn-to-Earn, Move-to-Earn: How to Earn Crypto in New Ways  “We're not catering to the CryptoPunk community, necessarily,” Chou said, referencing the pricey Ethereum-based NFT status symbol that launched in 2017. “But we want to make this as Web3 as possible, and help a Web2 company make the transition into Web3.”  Outside Interactive, Inc. is itself emerging from a digital metamorphosis that has nothing to do with crypto. The media conglomerate in May slashed 15% of its staff and shuttered print publications for many of its niche outdoor magazines in a pivot to video and an emphasis on online content.  CEO and Chairman Thurston spearheaded that shift. He came into the media with a focus on selling tailored, personalized content. Instead of driving revenue with ads (a business model the internet decimated), his company sells $60 memberships to all Outside content. Buyers of the Outerverse “passport” NFT will get three years' access to the bundle, known as Outside+.  He’s targeting 20 million Outside+ subscribers in the next few years; it so far boasts over 800,000, according to a company rep.  Digital first  Thurston said the pivot was necessary for a reader base overwhelmingly consuming Outside content online: “We wanted to be clear that we are digital first.” The Outerverse is part of the digital revamp, he said.  Along with driving people outdoors, Thurston said the Outerverse wil give creators – those making Warren Miller ski films and capturing gallery-worthy national parks photos – a chance to earn revenue directly from consumers. It has lined up over 40 outdoor “creators” to sell or share NFT versions of their work on the Outerverse Marketplace.  One of them is professional rock climber Sasha DiGiulian, a co-founder of outdoor education platform ROAM (which Outside acquired in late 2021). DiGiulian said in an email the Outerverse marketplace-to-creator business model is still “a bit in the gray right now” as discussions around her NFT integrations evolve.  DiGiulian, who became interested in crypto in 2016, said NFTs give creators a chance to own their intellectual property.  “That is something that doesn’t really exist in our current, very social media-driven world. As a professional athlete, I feel this,” she said in an email. “Creating a way to unlock access, incentivize people through their own outdoor participation, reward that with usable things like a marketplace for gear – it all makes sense.”  ‘Impenetrable garbage’  Still, not everyone in the outdoor media world is convinced that NFT incentives are the future. One ski blogger (who admitted he neither understands NFTs nor cares to learn what they are) lambasted the Outerverse as an “impenetrable pile of garbage.”  More crypto-conscious outdoor publishers are also skeptical of the effort. Mike Rogge, publisher of the indie outdoor journalism magazine Mountain Gazette, told CoinDesk he “believes” in the potential of crypto but disdains any effort to “gamify” the outdoors.  “Their mission of diversifying the outdoors is a valiant one,” Rogge said, “but I don’t know that [NFTs are] it.”  “I think you’re missing the point of going outdoors if you want to go outside and get a token.”  Note: This reporter owns two Outerverse passports and was a former intern at Backpacker Magazine, now owned by Outside Interactive.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/20/outside-magazine-wants-the-metaverse-to-take-a-hike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2009a7804f5075f653dbf42260f835877939fe71-1843x1382.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422683,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0oRvh,1658350894,"Stablecoin Firms Face Tough Reserve, Capital Demands in US Bill, Source Says","Companies that issue stablecoins would have to face bank-like regulations and back their tokens with conservative assets under the latest plan for U.S. legislation still being negotiated by leaders of the House Financial Services Committee, according to a person familiar with the talks.  The offices of Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and the panel’s ranking Republican, Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), have preliminarily agreed that stablecoins should be directly reinforced with assets such as cash and U.S. Treasury bonds that won’t be vulnerable in a panic, said the person, who requested anonymity because the legislation hasn’t yet been released to the public. The firms issuing them would also have to maintain capital, liquidity and open themselves to agency supervision, the person said.  The lawmakers’ effort packs heavy implications for global crypto trading, and it could leave some questions about how existing stablecoins can meet the new demands.  If the bipartisan effort clears the House of Representatives and can win enough votes in the Senate – potentially a higher hurdle – it would become the first significant legislation setting up U.S. regulations for a crucial corner of the cryptocurrency industry. It may also lend some long-awaited legal legitimacy to crypto, though it would narrow the path for how existing stablecoin firms would need to set themselves up in the U.S.  Stablecoins, which are tokens tied to the value of another asset such as the dollar, may also be able to lean on some amount of short-term repurchase agreements – highly liquid transactions in government securities – in their stringent new reserve requirements, the person said. And the new regulatory standards would also ban commercial companies issuing stablecoins, which would close a door on the tokens being issued by companies such as Meta’s (FB) Facebook, Amazon (AMZN) or Walmart (WMT).  The bill would additionally provide regulators with the power to insist on interoperability among stablecoins to guard against anti-competitive behavior.  A key worry among Republicans was that nonbank firms may not be given a chance to participate in the space they invented, but that concession was granted by letting issuers outside the banking system seek government approval to issue stablecoins. However, details on exactly how that would work haven’t yet emerged.  While today’s chief stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC make up a limited slice of the $1 trillion crypto market, their trading volume can easily eclipse other tokens because they are routinely used on the other side of transactions. When people buy and sell bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) or other coins, they’re often doing it with stablecoins because they act as a relatively steady proxy for the dollar.  Tether's USDT is the dominant dollar-tied token, and the issuer has often been targeted by critics complaining about the murky picture of the reserves meant to ensure a USDT can be safely swapped for a dollar. The British Virgin Islands-registered firm behind USDT reports that some of those reserves remain in commercial paper, or short-term corporate debt that yields higher returns than government securities but also comes with higher risk. The company has been working to reduce that debt use.  While the House’s legislation is said to provide a path for nonbank financial firms to issue stablecoins, as CoinDesk previously reported, the requirements for reserves and the demands that they maintain certain capital and liquidity levels – similar to the U.S. oversight of banks – may be an adjustment challenge for companies like Tether.  Last year, the U.S. Treasury Department – alongside key financial regulators – made recommendations on policing stablecoins. Though their President’s Working Group on Financial Markets report insisted that stablecoins issuers be walled within the perimeter of U.S. banking regulations, Nellie Liang, Treasury’s undersecretary for domestic finance, told reporters this week the agency never meant that issuers needed to be banks with deposit insurance. She said it would be OK with the financial watchdogs if the firms putting out stablecoins were merely affiliates of banks or bank holding companies, so they’d still be subject to the same regulations as mainstream lenders.  It’s unclear whether the current version of the legislation, which is expected to be finished as soon as this week, will please the regulators who would have to put it into action. A Treasury spokesman declined to comment on the latest discussions about the bill. And spokespeople for Waters and McHenry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on the effort.  The committee is planning for a legislative markup on July 27 to deal with the bill, the person familiar with the discussions said.  In recent months, the near-instant vaporization of $18 billion in the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) lent some steam to lawmakers hoping to put up guardrails around this sector. Regulators have pinpointed stablecoins as the crypto world’s greatest threat to financial stability, asking that Congress act fast. But to clear both chambers, the legislation needs to be bipartisan and exceedingly narrow to give the parties fewer points for objections.  The potential Waters-McHenry stablecoin bill is aiming at that mark, rather than trying to set up a wide-ranging system of rules to wrangle the whole industry, as previous legislation from senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is seeking to accomplish.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/20/stablecoin-firms-face-tough-reserve-capital-demands-in-us-bill-source-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5427556c15de96c1a4dbb4edcef630572944005b-3439x2579.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tuesday kicked off the conference, taking place in the Parisian conference center Maison de la Mutualité.  EthCC started things off a little hotter than previous years due to Europe's current heatwave, when the temperature reached as high as 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday. This made for a very sweaty event because there was no fully functioning air conditioning in the venue.  There has been little talk about the current bear market in cryptocurrencies and nearly no talk about price movement. The conference is largely focused on developing, hacking and networking.  Ether (ETH) has recovered over the last seven days after experiencing major dips in price as the rest of the market suffered. But it's been a staggering rally in the world's second-largest cryptocurrency: ETH is currently up 40% on the week.  Jane Ma, co-founder of zkLend, a lending protocol built on StarkNet (a layer 2 Ethereum network), came to the conference with her team to meet other builders and partake in hackathons.  “It feels like there’s no bear market when I step into the conference room,” said Ma in an interview with CoinDesk. The sentiment at the conference has been largely positive and it feels like people are here to stay, Ma said.  Although there’s loads of optimism in the room, there are retail users who are suffering from the current market and getting wiped out, or ""rekt"" in crypto-speak, said Ma. “We need to be conscious of that when we are at a crypto conference.”  In terms of news during the conference, on Wednesday Polygon Hermez announced the launch of ""Polygon zkEVM"" live from the main stage.  “This move is important because all of this knowledge is shared and public for the community,” said Jordi Baylina, technical lead at Hermez (zkEVM builder) at EthCC.  In a press release, Polygon said zkEVM would be the “first Ethereum-equivalent scaling solution that works seamlessly with all existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets, harnessing advanced cryptography called zero knowledge proofs.”  On Tuesday, Gitcoin’s co-founder, Kevin Owocki, announced the launch of the Gitcoin Passport, a digital identity product aimed at providing Sybil attack resistance (in a Sybil attack, an attacker tries to take over a network by creating an army of nodes that can over-power/out-vote honest nodes, leading to a 51% attack) and serving as a building block for an open internet and in turn enabling what he called a ""regenerative society.""  One attendee said he was standing behind Vitalik Buterin in the coffee line when the Ethereum co-founder ordered a cup of hot water. The waiters joked in French, “Who drinks just hot water?” after he’d left.  The conference is followed by all the usual crypto side events consisting of late-night partying in underground venues, rooftop dinners and various live DJ sets. One party was situated under the Pont Alexandre III Bridge, with local DJs performing until the early hours of the morning.  Wednesday also included a keynote from Aave’s Stani Kulechov, who outlined the benefits for Web3 social networks and promoted his own platform, “Lens Protocol.”  Lens focuses on empowering content creators to ""own their digital roots"" and have direct contact with their audiences.  “When you own your audience data you have direct contact with your audience. This can be super valuable,” said Kulechov. Lens protocol was previously built at a Hackathon, and “most of Lens is built by the community which is amazing,” said Kulechov.     Celo  Just outside of the EthCC conference is blockchain Celo’s “salon,” an intimate community space with its own stage and meeting point. The agenda at the salon is mainly focused on decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) discussions, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and regenerative finance (ReFi).  At the salon is Celo co-founder and President Rene Reinsberg, who is focusing on some of the positives to come out of a crypto bear market.  “During bear markets the discussion over 'Where is the most total value locked?' goes away and people start to focus on what are important use cases of projects and how the tech can improve people's lives,” said Reinsberg in an interview with CoinDesk.  He noted that although positive discussions stem from bear markets, it does have a negative impact on those who are new to the space or just curious about cryptocurrencies.  “When these people see big swings and volatility in prices, it scares people off,” Reinsberg said. “People take price movement and equate it to activity. These are detached. If you look at wallet growth overlaid with price, it is totally uncorrelated.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/20/vitalik-drinks-hot-water-in-heat-wave-and-other-observations-from-paris-ethereum-conference,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d87414192288a538853192c3f3fbd0826d855439-3024x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) gains continued as the cryptocurrency pushed to a one-month high of $24,265.  BTC was trading at around $23,700, up 0.5% over the past 24 hours. The gains add to Monday's 7.9% rise and Tuesday's 4.3% advance.  Bitcoin is attempting to climb above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) following ether’s breach of the average on Monday. Bitcoin’s 50-day SMA now sits at 24,862.  Alex Kuptsikevich, senior markets analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email that bitcoin’s price, when it’s near a key moving average, can be a reliable indicator of medium-term trends.  “Only a strong buy above this level can serve as a firm reversal indicator in the next few days,” Kuptsikevich wrote. “If the upside momentum stalls, as it did in February and March this year, we should be prepared for a sharp increase in selling.”  Many altcoins rose with Monero (XMR) leading the charts, up 3.8% over the past 24 hours.  Ether (ETH) was down 1.1%.  The S&P 500 was up 0.6%, and the Nasdaq rose 1.6%.  Today’s edition of ""Market Wrap"" was produced by Sage D. Young.

BTC Continues to Display Strength, While Showing a Slight Distinction From ETH  By Glenn Williams Jr.  On the macroeconomic front, there isn’t much in the form of price-changing catalysts.  Crypto investors, however, may wish to keep an eye on Wednesday's weekly petroleum status report – the rationale being that it allows investors to get an early read on the potential direction of energy prices and their impact on inflation data.  The report for the week ended July 15 showed total motor gasoline inventories increased by 3.5 million barrels and remained 3% below the five-year average for this time of year.  The importance of gasoline inventory levels is one of supply and demand. Traditionally, an increase in supplies can be read as bearish for prices, and a decrease in supplies can be read as bullish. This is especially true if and when inventory changes move outside of the band of expectations. Wednesday's expectations were for an increase of 71,000 barrels.  The relevance to crypto investors is tied to the extent to which energy prices will or will not prod the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more than the 75 basis points currently priced in.  Crypto investors will probably examine any and all data points that affect the total macro environment, particularly given the correlation (0.77) between BTC prices and the S&P 500. Correlations range between 0-1.0. A “zero” indicates no correlation, and 1.0 shows perfect correlation.  In Wednesday’s trading activity, BTC moved higher on above-average volume, with increasing relative strength (RSI).  Investors may interpret this as bullish in nature, as more longs are moving into BTC at an increasing pace. There was a slight departure when examining ETH, however.  While BTC and ETH are strongly correlated (0.92 as of this writing), investors may note that the increase in ETH prices has come on lower than average volume. Moreover, ETH’s RSI level of 66.41 is approaching 70, which is often interpreted as indicating overbought conditions.  A quick look at futures perpetual funding rates indicates a slight distinction between BTC and ETH, as well. Investors should note that funding rates represent payments to traders who are long (or short) a particular crypto currency. Positive rates indicate strength among buyers wishing to go long (bullish), while negative rates indicate greater strength among short position traders (bearish). As it stands, BTC has seen positive funding rates the last four trading days and eight out of the last 10.  Comparatively, ETH funding rates (while currently positive) have managed to do so in five of the last 10 trading days. Moreover, the lower funding rate implies that traders expecting to go long ETH are willing to pay less to do so at the moment.

The Austin-based EV manufacturer posted non-GAAP EPS of $2.27 and revenue of $16.9B. Analysts had anticipated $1.80 and $17.1B, respectively. The strong bottom line figure appeared to assuage some concerns about the “gigantic money furnace” gigafactories in Austin and Berlin weighing on that metric. Free cash flow also rose above estimates, hitting $619M against an expectation of $500M. While prices for Tesla ( TSLA ) vehicles are up 25% to 30% from a year ago, automotive margins compressed for the quarter to 27.9%. That figure falls below the 32.9% number that impressed in the first quarter and 28.4% notched in 2021. Having already reported a slightly disappointing delivery figure of 254,695 EVs for the second quarter, deliveries growth was projected to continue at a rapid pace from this slight slowdown. ""We plan to grow our manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible,” a slide deck released alongside the earnings results read. “Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries.” Analysts had been optimistic on the metric despite understood troubles in China and supply chain pressures throughout the quarter. For example, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives had opined just days before the results that a 50% pace could boost the long-term EV demand thesis around the stock. Elsewhere, the company reported it had sold 75% of its position in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), alleviating some anxiety on that balance sheet burden. The position has been folded into other currencies outside of the crypto space. Total sales of the cryptocurrency amounted to $936M. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laura Hoy lamented the likelihood that crypto bets ""chipped away at profits"". While she expressed relief that ""most of the damage has been recognized"" after the sale of 3/4 of the automaker's holdings, the bet itself is cause to scrutinize Elon Musk's impulsive behavior. ""The bitcoin losses point out an important part of the Tesla investment case—its eccentric owner,"" she wrote on Wednesday evening. ""While Musk’s impressive innovation has served the company well, his personal flair is starting to raise governance questions.” Shares rose 2.22% shortly after the report crossed newswires, before dipping into the red as the extended session progressed. The stock then seesawed between slightly positive and slightly negative prior a conference call with analysts.

42395160,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXPeP,1658348232,Tesla Sold $936M Worth of Bitcoin in Second Quarter,"Electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) sold $936 million worth of bitcoin (BTC), or 75% of its holdings, in the second quarter, the company reported Wednesday in its earnings report.  CEO Elon Musk said during Tesla's earnings call that the company sold the majority of its bitcoin to maximize its cash position, ""given the uncertainty of the COVID lockdowns in China."" He added, however, that Tesla is open to boosting its bitcoin exposure in the future, and ""this should not be taken as some verdict on Bitcoin."" Musk also said Tesla had not sold any of its dogecoin.  The price of bitcoin fell about 1.7% to $23,300 immediately following the release of the earnings report, but rebounded to its previous levels after Musk made his comments on the earnings call.  Tesla ended the second quarter with just $218 million in bitcoin (BTC), down from $1.26 billion in the previous three quarters. The company said it realized a gain on the sale of its holdings, which was offset by impairment charges on the remainder of its bitcoin, resulting in a net cost of $106 million to its profit and loss statement.  The company held about 42,000 bitcoin heading into the quarter, so if it sold 75% of that amount for $936 million, that would equate to an average selling price of about $29,000 per bitcoin. Bitcoin ended the second quarter at a price of about $18,700, meaning Tesla avoided a substantial impairment charge on its holdings by selling earlier in the quarter.  Tesla announced in Feb. 2021 it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, a move that caused the price of bitcoin to surge. Later in that first quarter the company trimmed its bitcoin position by 10%, a sale that boosted that quarter’s earnings by $272 million. It had not bought or sold any more bitcoin until the most recent announcement.  The company began accepting bitcoin as payment for its vehicles in March of last year, but Musk reversed that decision about six weeks later, citing concerns about the environmental impact of mining bitcoin.  Overall for the second quarter, Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.27, beating the consensus of analyst estimates reported to FactSet of $1.81 a share, on revenue of $16.9 billion, ahead of a $16.5 billion estimate. Shares of Tesla were rising 0.7% to 746.78 in after-hours trading.  A company call with analysts is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET (21:30 UTC).

While Minecraft acknowledged the potential benefits of introducing NFTs to its games – namely providing in-game collectibles and play-to-earn style rewards – it also pointed to drawbacks:  “NFTs are not inclusive of all our community and create a scenario of the haves and the have-nots,” the company said. “The speculative pricing and investment mentality around NFTs takes the focus away from playing the game and encourages profiteering, which we think is inconsistent with the long-term joy and success of our players.”  NFT worlds  The biggest loser of Minecraft’s announcement has been NFT Worlds, a Web3 gaming project focused on third-party blockchain and NFT Minecraft integrations. Prices for the project’s NFTs plummeted 70% following the announcement, though the project’s developers say they won’t be abandoning the community.  The price of the project’s native WRLD token is also down 65% on the news, according to CoinMarketCap.  Culture wars  The announcement comes amid a debate between traditional gamers who oppose NFTs and Web3 believers who champion them. The arguments for and against NFTs in gaming typically boil down to two schools of thought: NFT haters don’t want to over-financialize the sector, while NFT enthusiasts deem the technology as a way to deal with what they see as money-hungry publishers.  The NFT gaming debate started burning last December, when popular game publisher Ubisoft announced it would integrate the technology into its “Tom Clancy” series.  That announcement, like Minecraft’s on Wednesday, was met with both praise and criticism, with Ubisoft eventually canning the NFT experiment altogether.  Microsoft’s metaverse  Minecraft’s disdain for NFTs isn't unique within the landscape of big-name gaming properties. Valve has long banned NFTs, and blockchain integrations from its gaming marketplace Steam, a hotbed for trading in-game, non-NFT digital assets such as character skins. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, says it’s also staying away from integrating NFTs in any of its in-house titles, though it hasn’t barred games that use them from its marketplace like Valve.  Minecraft’s decision may be a temperature check of what’s to come with Microsoft’s plan for the metaverse.

While elite schools such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have been leading the pack – its ""Blockchain and Money"" course had been taught since 2014 by then-professor Gary Gensler, who in 2021 became the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – the movement has broadened. Last month, for example, the University of Cincinnati announced that a recent donation has enabled the launch of two blockchain programs and a lab to begin this fall at its Carl H. Lindner College of Business.  Against this backdrop, CoinDesk is kicking off its third annual Best Universities for Blockchain ranking. We are seeking nominations for any university with blockchain courses, faculty, clubs, conferences or research. How much has the growing interest in cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens entered the college campus? CoinDesk has been tracking university blockchain activity since 2020. We will be scoring schools worldwide for their scholarly impact, campus blockchain offerings, employment and industry outcomes and other measures.  Tracking innovation among the more than 25,000 universities in the world is a pursuit of the many. CoinDesk appreciates informed nominations.

Being able to exceed not just Binance USD but also Cardano and Solana is a noteworthy accomplishment for Ripple’s native currency. Ripple’s native token, XRP, provides a means of payment settlement between banks and digital assets exchanges. It decreases the number of extra steps needed when transferring money internationally, which leads to lower fees. Related Reading | Solana And Avalanche Poised For Gains As Crypto Market Enjoys New Tailwinds However, by breaking through significant resistance, XRP overtakes Binance USD’s market cap and gains the upper hand by 8%. The primary factor contributing to XRP’s placement in sixth place is the coin’s weekly price increase of more than 21%. There is much more to be done for the battle between Binance USD and Ripple. However, both are still trying very hard to make headway which, under the right conditions, could lead to them taking fifth or fourth place- or even third and second place- in addition to keeping their original standings of sixth and seventh. Following news updates on the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit, the more optimistic investor attitude led to an increase in the coin’s price. Fans and developers of Ripple are now closely following the U.S. SEC’s continuing lawsuit against the business, which appears to be interesting, according to the most recent news. Analysis Of Ripple (XRP) Struggles to Regain its Value In terms of the lifespan of cryptocurrency, Ripple is one of the longest. When it was first introduced in 2012, it frequently traded for less than $0.10. However, when the crypto market experienced a boom in late 2017 and early 2018. XRP was one of them which gained much from this boom and recorded its all-time high on January 4, 2018, at $3.84. The coin soon started to decline, and by the end of 2018, it was only worth $0.50. By then, XRP’s value continued to decline. The coin was in the early stages of a bull run that ended on April 14, 2021, when it touched an average high of $1.96. Since the beginning of September 2021, the sixth-largest coin has struggled, dropping more than half of its value, while dozens of other cryptocurrencies have collapsed in this period. The situation worsened in January 2022 when a sluggish cryptocurrency market caused XRP to end the month at $0.6191. Following that, it fell even further, reaching $0.345 on May 12 due to the market turbulence caused by the de-pegging of the TerraUSD stablecoin and the demise of LUNA.

Following that, the cancellation of withdrawals by the cryptocurrency lending firm Celsius confirmed that the cryptocurrency market is in a bear market, and on June 18, it dropped to $0.2906. However, it has already bounced back from its June low and is presently trading at $0.366650, up 12.6% in 14 days. In addition, the Finder’s panel forecasts that the price of Ripple (XRP) will increase by almost 260 % in 2022 and reach $2.55 this year at the end of December.

42421136,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWI9,1658345591,US 'Missing From the Table' on CBDC Discussions: Atlantic Council Director,"Many countries are far ahead of the United States in developing central bank digital currencies (CBDC), and that may be for good reason, according to one financial institutions expert.  Josh Lipsky, senior director at think tank Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” that of the 105 countries exploring implementing a CBDC, 50 are serious about it, meaning “they’re in the development, pilot or launch [phase], beyond the research stage.”  “That means they're very likely to actually go through with this,” Lipsky said.  Lipsky, who previously served as an adviser at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said those investigating the use of a CBDC includes South Korea, Japan and India, in addition to China, which currently leads the way in pilot testing efforts. China is said to have about 250 million registered digital wallets using its digital yuan.  However, the U.S., the U.K. and Mexico are “still in the research stage” while other countries like Argentina are outliers, meaning they are “nowhere in the CBDC progress,” he added.  CBDCs are considered to be the digital form of a country’s fiat currency, which is administered by a central bank. Rather than printing physical cash, a central bank issues a digital currency that is backed by the government.  Lipsky noted the U.S. may have some justification for dragging its feet.  The U.S. has “moved more slowly because of privacy concerns,” he said. “And that’s a very legitimate concern.”  In the long run, however, delaying could put the U.S. at a disadvantage. “Now we see competitors from an economic space moving and finding solutions on those privacy answers, and the U.S. is still missing from the table a little bit,” he said.  Lipsky said he frequently talks to central bankers from around the world, and they are asking, “Where’s the U.S. model? Where’s the U.S. in standard setting?”  “I think that’s missing right now,” Lipsky said. “The U.S. could be doing more.”  Lipsky said that since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine there has been increased interest in wholesale bank-to-bank CBDCs as a result of the issues raised from banking sanctions.  Wholesale CBDCs give central banks more room to implement regulatory oversight, including know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.  “If you think countries are going to look to alternatives to the current financial system, alternatives around SWIFT, alternatives to bank-to-bank dollar transactions, wholesale CBDCs actually open up some avenues for them,” Lipsky said.  Over the next five years, countries could be looking to China for their own CBDC infrastructure, Lipsky said. But that does not mean that countries are looking to use the country’s CBDC infrastructure entirely. He did not agree with former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chief J. Christopher Giancarlo’s comments that one-third of the world’s CBDC infrastructure could eventually be built and controlled by China.  According to Lipsky, China’s CBDC motivation is more closely aligned with its domestic affairs than its international ones, including the ability to monitor via surveillance what citizens are doing in real time.  And even if China provided the technology, it would not be providing the CBDC itself, Lipsky predicted.  “I’m not sure anyone has thought through how these are going to interact cross-border,” Lipsky said. “China could say, ‘Yes, use our technology. But by the way, if you're looking for a streamlined CBDC model, we can help you there, too.’”  The different iterations of CBDC infrastructure could also create challenges. Of those 105 countries considering CBDCs, Lipsky said, no two are alike, and that could carry over into digital currency cross-border transactions. “This is a real interoperability problem.”  Read more: Australian Central Bank Chief Believes Regulated Private Tokens Could Be Better Than CBDCs: Report",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | COMMODITY | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/20/us-missing-from-the-table-on-cbdc-discussions-atlantic-council-director,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c33f871f5cf839887adb044fa2adfe2d74a8a42-1461x1096.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Compass’ deployment will start in August and continue for “several months,” according to the company. Compass seeks to deploy 25,000 application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners to the Wolf Hollow plant site in Granbury.  In a move to readdress its strategy, Compass recently cut 15% of its staff and lowered executive compensation following the resignation of its CEO and chief financial officer. Compass cited ""multiple setbacks and disappointments"" for the executive changes.  The new power plant uses advanced gas turbine designs and air cooling to decrease carbon emissions and water dependence, according to Compass’ statement. Regarding Texas’ demand response program, which aids the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market, the data center is able to curtail its load to ERCOT.  The move comes as bitcoin miners continue to work with ERCOT on voluntary curtailments for their operations as soaring temperatures cause increased power demand and grid constraints in Texas.

42421134,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWF3,1658343938,‘A Damaged Brand’: Former Celsius Employee on the Crypto Lender’s Mismanagement and Alleged Token Manipulation,"Now-insolvent crypto lending company Celsius Network operated in a hectic, chaotic and disorganized manner, according to one former employee.  Timothy Cradle, the platform’s former compliance and financial crimes director, told CoinDesk TV “of sloppiness and mismanagement” at the company.  “Certain teams were too small and communication was a bit poor between departments, and especially across Celsius U.K. and Celsius U.S.,” Cradle said on CDTV’s “First Mover” program. “Celsius wasn’t the exception to what one would expect.”  The New Jersey-based crypto lender recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of New York, after freezing customer withdrawals more than a month prior.  Cradle said he was motivated to speak out about internal practices within Celsius because the company allegedly betrayed one of its core promises – transparency.  Manipulating the CEL Token?  Among oddities, said Cradle, was an onboarding session with a customer at which the Celsius chief financial officer said the company did not engage in trading. “That just didn’t make any sense to me,” said Cradle, noting Celsius had a trading desk and a head of trading.  He noted that trading wasn’t even in Celsius’ risk disclosures that were made to customers.  “I didn’t think there was anything intentional or malicious about withholding that information,” he said. “I just thought Celsius didn’t want people to know how they were generating yield.”  While Cradle said he does not think Celsius should have been compelled to disclose to whom it was lending, the company’s risk disclosure should have provided insight into how it was deploying assets.  Cradle also hinted that alleged market manipulation was taking place, and detailed a conversation during a Christmas party back in 2019. “The CFO and the head of trading at the time mentioned they were active in the market, attempting to increase the price [of Celsius' CEL token],” he claimed.  In another conversation that took place near the end of 2020 between an executive and a compliance team member, Cradle said he heard Celsius was looking to hold prices of the CEL token down in order to trim the bonus pool.  “It seems pretty apparent that Celsius was actively manipulating the price of the [CEL] token,” Cradle said.  “I think someone would have to be frankly insane to trust Celsius with their assets at this point,” said Cradle, throwing shade on the company’s efforts at avoiding liquidation and instead continuing as an ongoing business.

Bitcoin Public Miners Capitulate As Mining Revenues Stay Quite Low As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, BTC miners sold almost 400% of their production during the last month. Miners pay off their electricity bills, expansions, and other running costs using dollars. As such, the USD value of their Bitcoin rewards is the more relevant metric for them. Since the price of the crypto has been in a state of decline during the last few months, times have been hard for the miners recently. Even so, the large public mining companies still held onto their treasuries through January to April, selling only 20% to 40% of what they mined during the period, and accumulating the rest. This, however, couldn’t continue in May when the value of Bitcoin took a large hit from $40k down to $30k. Miners had to start liquidating their holdings to fund their expenses, and in total they sold more BTC than they produced during the month.

163060,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=241659,1658341054,An Introduction to the Near Protocol: What is it and How Does it Work?,"If you want to create decentralized apps, the solution may be Near Protocol. This software encourages a network of computers to operate as a platform for developers. As a consequence, creating and releasing their own decentralized application is straightforward. You’ll discover everything you need to know about Near Protocol in this guide. What is Near Protocol? Near Protocol is a blockchain protocol created to improve the performance and fees associated with Ethereum. It uses sharding in order to make its blockchain more scalable. This process essentially allows the network to be divided into multiple subnetworks, each of which can process transactions in parallel. As a result, the overall network can handle more transactions without being bogged down. In addition to sharding, Near Protocol also uses something called “state sharding”. This means that every machine on the network only stores a portion of the data (or “state”). By doing this, it becomes unnecessary for each machine to store the entire blockchain history. Not only does this make the network more scalable, but it also makes it more secure since there would be no single point of failure. Origin of Near The idea for the Protocol originated in early 2017 when co-founders Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin were working on scaling solutions for Ethereum. They quickly realized the existing blockchain protocols were not well equipped to handle large-scale applications due to slow performance and expensive fees. After nearly two years of research and development, Near Protocol was finally launched in April 2019. The Protocol is powered by the NEAR token, which is used to pay for transaction fees and gas costs. The team behind Near Protocol has set out to create a more efficient and user-friendly protocol than Ethereum. So far, they seem to be succeeding in their endeavor as the Protocol has processed over 1 million transactions. How Does Near Protocol Work? Now that we know a bit about the background of Near Protocol, let’s dive into how it works. The first thing to note is that Near Protocol is designed to be developer-friendly. In order to make this happen, the team behind Near created the NEAR Shell. This tool allows developers to interact with the blockchain in order to deploy and test their decentralized applications. In addition, NEAR Shell also provides developers with access to various templates and examples. As a result, getting started with Near Protocol is relatively simple. In terms of consensus, Near Protocol uses “Proof-of-Stake”. Under this system, those who hold NEAR tokens can stake them in order to become validators. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions and maintaining the blockchain. In return for their efforts, they receive a portion of the rewards generated by transaction fees. It’s also worth mentioning that Near Protocol uses sharding in order to make its blockchain more scalable. This process essentially allows the network to be divided into multiple subnetworks, each of which can process transactions in parallel. As a result, the overall network can handle more transactions without being bogged down. In addition to sharding, Near Protocol also uses something called “state sharding”. This means that every machine on the network only stores a portion of the data (or “state”). By doing this, it becomes unnecessary for each machine to store the entire blockchain history. Not only does this make the network more scalable, but it also makes it more secure since there would be no single point of failure. Projects Based on Near The Near Protocol team has been working on the project since 2017 and launched the mainnet in April 2020. Since then, a number of projects have been built on top of the Near Protocol network. Some of these projects include: Waltonchain: Waltonchain is a blockchain platform that combines RFID technology with blockchain to create an efficient supply chain management system. NearShore: NearShore is a decentralized application platform built on Near Protocol. It allows developers to deploy and manage their dApps quickly. NearShore also provides a number of helpful toolkits and libraries to make dApp development easier. Status: Status is a mobile Ethereum client that allows users to access dApps on the go. The client also features an integrated messenger, wallet, and browser. Status is planning to integrate with Near Protocol in the future to allow users to access Near dApps. Celer Network: Celer Network is a layer-2 scaling solution that enables fast, easy, and secure off-chain transactions. Celer Network plans to integrate with Near Protocol to enable near-instant transactions on the Celer Network. NEAR Token The NEAR token is the native token of the Near Protocol, and it is used to pay for transaction fees, gas, staking, and other services on the network. The total supply of NEAR tokens is 1 billion, and the tokens are distributed as follows: 60% of NEAR tokens are allocated for … Continued The post An Introduction to the Near Protocol: What is it and How Does it Work? appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform .",POSITIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ICO | TECHNOLOGY | NEAR,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/an-introduction-to-the-near-protocol-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=an-introduction-to-the-near-protocol-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42421478,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUft,1658340272,"Circle's Cautious USDC Approach Has Paid Off, Despite Missteps","The Chief Financial Officer of Circle Internet Financial, Jeremy Fox-Green, earlier this week reaffirmed the cryptocurrency financial services firm’s plan to go public later this year. On the one hand, this isn’t news: Circle’s plans were first announced in June of last year.  On the other hand, the affirmation is huge considering how drastically circumstances in the digital asset industry have changed in the meantime. That Circle is still healthy enough to go public in the current bearish environment is a huge vindication for a company that has made its share of missteps, and which took the better part of a decade to find a killer app with its USDC stablecoin.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  There was a time when Circle seemed like a spent and directionless organization. Founded by Jeremy Allaire in 2013 as an early crypto payments company with an institutional bent, Circle was arguably a bit premature in providing retail services. The company also devoted a lot of energy to jumping over regulatory hurdles at a time when many crypto firms still dismissed such niceties. Way back in 2015, for instance, Circle became the first company to earn New York’s much-maligned Bitlicense.  Not too long ago, Circle seemed to be flailing for purpose so badly that those regulatory efforts began to seem like wasted effort. The apparent lack of mission clarity was thrown into sharpest relief when Circle bought the early, somewhat reputationally sketchy crypto exchange Poloniex in 2018 – and then sold it a year later for a $156 million loss. Circle then rapidly sold off many business lines, including a mobile investing app to Voyager Digital (R.I.P.) in February of 2020.  Rather than a sign of desperation, though, this pruning was part of a plan to focus entirely on the fully backed USDC stablecoin. That didn’t always seem like a slam-dunk: USDC had attracted barely more than $500 million worth of deposits by early 2020, compared to $4.2 billion worth of competitor Tether’s USDT token then in circulation.  But, despite missteps along the way, Allaire and company can take a preliminary victory lap for their comparatively cautious approach. From just 12% of Tether’s size at the start of 2020, Circle is now on a trajectory to match and maybe even exceed its primary competitor’s scale.  Transparency and oversight  Plagued by market uncertainty and regulatory scrutiny, Tether’s circulating market cap has dropped from a peak of $83 billion in May to $66 billion in mid-July. To Tether’s immense credit, redemptions have gone smoothly. But some of those redeemers seem to have made a more or less direct switch to USDC, which saw deposits grow from $49 billion in May to $55 billion today.  That reversal of fortune is almost certainly because of Tether’s much more complicated relationship to transparency and regulation. USDT is structured similarly to USDC, with off-chain assets backing a dollar-denominated stablecoin. But Tether has been the target of skeptics for years, both because of its eyebrow-raising relationship to the Bitfinex exchange and because it has not released a detailed and trustworthy report of USDT’s backing assets.  Among other concerns, Tether has affirmed it holds $3.7 billion worth of commercial paper, down from $30 billion in June of 2021. Tether has not specified the companies that issued this debt, or even its nation of origin. In response to an earlier version of this piece, Tether explicitly stated it does not hold Chinese commercial paper, the first time it appears to have made that specific claim.  Notably, Tether in October of 2021 denied owning debt in Chinese developer Evergrande, but its lawyer declined to confirm or deny ownership of other Chinese debt. In mid-June of 2022, Tether denied an estimate that its backing was 85% Asian-originated corporate debt, but again did not specify the national origin of the debt it did hold.  Given the sharp drawdown in Tether's commercial paper holdings and its various carefully worded disclosures over the past year, it seems highly likely that Tether has in the past held Chinese short-term corporate debt. If it liquidated in the past three months in line with its shrinking circulation, it may very well have taken a loss on the liquidation: as a proxy for the broader Chinese economy, China's SSE stock index has since March traded as much as 20% down from levels in late 2021 and early 2022, when Tether was still growing.  Last week, by contrast, Circle issued a detailed asset breakdown which, though unaudited, claimed that Circle’s USDC stablecoin is backed entirely by U.S. dollars and highly liquid short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. It’s worth noting here why Circle releasing an unaudited backing report is not the same as Tether issuing an unaudited report: Circle, simply because it is a registered U.S. financial entity, is subject to material forces that should keep it honest. Circle has made numerous U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings ahead of its public listing, for instance. Critics have demanded a third-party audit from Tether in large part because Tether is not clearly subject to any highly trusted regulatory regime.  There is increasing consensus that stablecoins may be crypto’s predominant killer app, serving not just as a safe haven for crypto day traders, but also as a genuine improvement over the wire system for international trade, and a useful personal finance tool for individuals abroad who can’t easily access conventional dollars. U.S. regulators seem increasingly warm to building controls that can assure the trustworthiness of digital dollars issued by entities like Circle.  Long road  Over the course of nearly a decade, Jeremy Allaire has done the long, hard work of positioning Circle to benefit from the growth of stablecoin demand. Now, Circle is positioned to make a public market debut at a time when the lack of hype and deflated market could make it a discount buy.  My only critique is that the plan is still to use a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) rather than a conventional initial public offering (IPO). A SPAC is a listed shell company that would become Circle through a reverse merger. It’s a method of publicly listing a stock that has lower disclosure requirements than an IPO.  The plan might be difficult to change at this point, at Circle’s misfortune. Trust in the entire SPAC approach has been significantly undermined by its use by figures like Chamath Palihapitiya to sell baskets of garbage stocks with lessened disclosure at times of maximum hype. The structure has come to seem low-rent and scammy relative to other elements of the Circle offering.  But despite that gripe, the headline here is hugely positive. Allaire’s marathon effort and careful approach is about to pay off for him and investors in a big way, while more than a few of his overextended and incautious competitors are lying in a ditch. It’s a lesson worth remembering for the next cycle of crypto hype, when young, optimistic, inexperienced founders once again start promising the moon.

The Zipmex exchange launched in 2018, offering trading and investment services in Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Australia. On Wednesday, Zipmex tweeted that it was blocking customers from taking direct custody of their funds due to volatile market conditions and the resulting financial difficulties for its key business partners.  The backstory, according to an industry executive briefed on the matter by people with direct knowledge of the situation, is that a Singaporean arm of Zipmex faces a loss on about $100 million of funds lent through a product called ""ZipUp"" to the now beleaguered, Hong Kong-based Babel. Zipmex made the loan earlier, part of an effort to generate additional yield.  CoinDesk reported earlier this month that Babel, which froze withdrawals in June, was looking to hire the restructuring specialist Houlihan Lokey.  Jeff Zhao, a Babel spokesperson, told CoinDesk in a statement that ""the loan business between Zipmex and Babel is far less than $100 million.""  According to a press release in August 2021, Zipmex has an exchange and brokerage license in Thailand.  The person with knowledge of the matter said that the company was not permitted under the Thai license to reappropriate regular customer funds, but it could reinvest funds that were routed through the ZipUp product.  Zipmex has begun reaching out to investors in search of fresh funds, according to one executive who was contacted about the plan. Another person associated with Babel's restructuring confirmed that the company owes money to Zipmex.  A request for comment sent to Zipmex CEO Marcus Lim over LinkedIn had not been returned as of press time. Lim told the crypto news outlet Cointelegraph that the group ""doesn't comment on rumors.""  Babel Finance declined to comment on questions related to the Zipmex loan, or to provide any update on its own financial status.  Zipmex fundraising  Last year, Zipmex raised $41 million including an investment from the Bank of Ayudhya, one of Thailand's largest banks.  In June, The Block reported the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase had been in talks to acquire Zipmex but ultimately agreed to make a strategic investment in the firm. According to the report, Zipmex opted to raise some $40 million of funds in an investment round at a $400 million valuation.  Despite this, Coinbase confirmed to CoinDesk Wednesday afternoon that they have no investment in Zipmex.

Related Reading | Why Bitcoin Must Beat $25,500 To Establish A Bull Rally The chances of an extended bullish momentum seem to be increasing as the macro-economic factors impacting risk-on assets mitigate in short timeframes. The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) has begun a period of no contact with the media, and dollar inflation seems bound to decline. This metric as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) stands at a 40-year high and will take a dive in its July print according to data provided by the Bank of America. The banking institution surveyed the market and determined investors “really expect inflation to drop” over the next two years. In addition, as stated by economist Alex Krüger, U.S. equities indices are trending to the upside with “remarkably strong” technical. The Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 have broken out of long ascending triangles which suggests a reclaimed of previous highs. The Nasdaq 100 is currently trading at 12,343 with important gains since the start of July. Krüger believes this Index could return to its April 2022 levels which would represent an important bullish trend. The economist said via Twitter: Given the absence of Fed surprises until September’s FOMC (expect July to be a non-event) and assuming no major negative developments on the European front, a summer rally taking prices there makes sense to me. These three factors, absent Fed, a potential decline in inflation, and U.S. equity rallying, are the best-case scenario in the current macro-economic conditions. The crypto market has been showing a high correlation with the Nasdaq 100 and could benefit from a summer rally. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies are already breaking above critical resistance levels. ETH’s price leads the market recovery with a 50% profit in the past week and BTC’s price follows with a 23% profit. What Could Get In The Way Of A Crypto Summer Rally? According to Krüger, U.S. equities need to remain in the green during this earnings season. Stock indices have been reacting well to earnings reports from Netflix, but Tesla and Apple’s reports could truly define this period as a win or a retrace for the crypto market.

He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.  1772-1773 credit crisis  Sounds like the crypto market in 2022? It also describes the European credit crisis of 1772-73. That particular banking panic is one of the lesser-known crises of the 18th century. After the Treaty of Paris in 1763 ended the French and Indian War, Great Britain gained a stable claim on territories in North America. That made it safe to invest in the new territories, and bankers in Europe obliged with enthusiasm.  Colonial planters needed credit, and British merchants wanted commodities to sell to more markets. A credit boom resulted, as did a speculative fervor among traders in London and Europe. Shares in the British East India Company rallied sharply in 1772 as traders heaped on margin to trade with.  In mid-1772, events came to a head as the London bank Neale, James, Fordyce and Downe failed, having shorted East India Company shares with leverage. Among its major creditors was the Scottish bank Douglas Heron & Co., also known as the Ayr Bank. Scotland was operating on a laissez-faire or “free” (as in speech) banking period at the time, and largely unregulated, startup banks were the norm. The Ayr Bank had been formed just three years prior by major landowning families in Scotland. It was intended to serve as a kind of private Scottish central bank.  Ayr was a full liability institution, with deposits guaranteed by the land holdings of its shareholders. In its short existence, it eagerly issued credit and banknotes, quickly becoming one of the largest banks in Scotland. It had a reputation for extending credit on loose terms to close affiliates. When the Fordyce bank blew up on leverage, it took down the Ayr Bank as well. Fordyce himself fled to France. It later emerged that he had been temporarily covering losses with inflows from customer funds.  Read more: Nic Carter vs. The Bitcoin Maximalists - David Z. Morris  A credit crunch developed in the following weeks, hitting London, Edinburgh and Amsterdam, bringing down dozens of financial institutions. Credit conditions froze up. As for the Ayr Bank, its liquidation ended up taking decades, bringing down some of the largest landowning families in Scotland. A material fraction of Scottish lands was sold off to make depositors whole.  Lessons learned  You might think that, post crisis, Scotland would have reconsidered its laissez-faire banking system. Quite the contrary. The Ayr Bank is remembered as the major failure of the Scottish free banking era, which lasted from 1714 to 1844 and was a model of stability – all without any central administration. Other Scottish banks did fairly well throughout the crisis, as they were able to redeem Ayr banknotes for underlying reserves. And the lessons of the Ayr collapse – chronicled by none other than Adam Smith at the time – were successfully internalized by the market.  Bitcoiners attacking lending institutions are undermining their own interests  Today, bitcoiners are gleeful about the collapse of credit in the crypto industry. As I write, a few high-profile bitcoiners are gathered in a Twitter space entitled “RIP Celsius. Long Live Bitcoin.” To be clear, I’ve never been a fan of Celsius Network, and I have long been skeptical of its approach. But the failure of that institution and many of its peers, alongside a new spate consolidation in the lending sector, doesn't make crypto credit obsolete. It simply ensures the sector will reemerge invigorated, reformed and more prudently managed.  Bitcoiners attacking lending institutions are undermining their own interests. Many adherents to the Bitcoin maximalist doctrine maintain a curious disdain for credit. They often follow a Rothbardian ideal, believing fractional reserve banking to be “fraud,” even though the idealized “full reserve banking” generally never emerges in free market conditions.  During Scottish “free banking,” a fully laissez-faire, markets-based system, reserve ratios were commonly 2-5%, and the system worked swimmingly.  “Full reserve” banks wouldn't be able to extend credit or transform maturity – they can scarcely be described as “banks” at all. A world with no credit is a dismal one. Credit – responsibly extended – is the cornerstone of civilization. It unleashes savings and puts the money to work in productive areas of the economy. A world without credit is a sterile, stagnant one.  Bitcoin maximalists  In case you think I’m making this anti-credit crusade up, just read the words of self-described maximalist Stephan Livera, under the heading “what do Bitcoin maximalists actually believe?”:  In practice, most of the maximalists I know are simply not interested in nonmonetary uses and are more interested in distinguishing bitcoin from all of the “crypto” garbage out there. And at times like these, with so many crypto lenders stopping withdrawals (Celsius, Vauld, Voyager), filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (Voyager) or taking bailout deals (BlockFi, Voyager), there’s a strong case to say the maximalists were right.  Read more: Nic Carter on How to Make the Best of a Bear Market (podcast)  But were they? If their victory condition is “no credit is ever extended based on a crypto asset ever again,” they guarantee a loss. Yes, the lending industry has taken a hit, but it certainly won’t cease to exist. The desire for leverage and a lower cost of capital on one hand, and yield on the other, is inherent to free, capitalist enterprise, and that urge will never disappear. Bitcoiners who ostensibly believe in free markets should recognize that this necessarily includes the market for money, as well.  Bitcoiners embracing the Rothbardian view cannot reconcile the demonstrated history of “fractional reserve” credit extension under total free market conditions, free of state interference. Consumers throughout history have preferred banknotes to hauling specie around. Businesses and individuals have desired leverage, and banks have been happy to give it to them.  Even in the most radically unencumbered conditions, free of state influence, “full reserve” banking doesn't emerge naturally. Just look to laissez-faire banking regimes in Scotland, Switzerland, Sweden or Canada in the 18th and 19th centuries.  In defense of credit  In a 2020 defense of crypto credit creation, I wrote the following on CoinDesk:  ""By no means is the state of credit in the crypto industry perfect. I expect many more failures from these depository institutions. But with each failure, depositors will gain an appreciation for the merit of diligence, and will start to scrutinize these institutions more carefully. And each failure is evidence that financial institutions can, indeed, fail, without the state stepping in. These painful lessons will force the industry to adopt best practices around transparency, depository assurances and reserve ratios. Lacking a paternalistic state to backstop credit and bail out excessive risk-taking, the industry can benefit from negative feedback.""  Well, here we are. We have suffered our first true systemic credit crisis. Virtually no lender has been unaffected. We got no government-level bailouts (the “bailouts” bitcoiners derisively refer to are simply private markets distressed asset transactions – normal in any market), no state intervention, and yet the credit markets will recover from here.  The dust still hasn’t settled, but it’s clear that we already have the tools to build a more robust lending system. As it happens, bitcoin is the perfect form of collateral upon which to build banks. As a cryptographically auditable, digital bearer instrument, with cheap physical delivery, it vastly outperforms gold specie as a collateral type. The problem with gold is it’s costly to verify, meaning it ends up in walled gardens and consumers rarely want to redeem notes for specie. So the gold-based system empowered banking institutions at the expense of depositors.  An opaque market  The problem with the 1.0 version of crypto credit markets was the opacity of the system, its dependence on artificial DeFi (decentralized finance) yields (as chronicled by myself and Allen Farrington) and a general undercurrent of fraud, facilitated by the loosest financial conditions in living memory.  This can obviously be improved upon. Hybrid CeFi/DeFi credit markets are already extending credit under-collateralized in a fully transparent manner, a massive improvement compared with the default CeFi (centralized finance) model.  Both consumers and regulators alike will insist on transparency, and the emerging DeFi infrastructure is poised to give it to them. We are seeing lenders experimenting with proofs-of-reserve. This will surely be refined and extended. Underwriting standards are being tightened. And future lenders, mindful of the rapidity of the bank runs possible with crypto assets, will have to maintain more prudent liquidity and reserve ratios.  The bitcoiner “not your keys, not your coins” doctrine is also ironic in this context; if bitcoiners had spent more time building better tools to use bitcoin in a noncustodial manner, they wouldn’t have been subject to the false binary of full custodial intermediation versus full self-custody.  Intermediate models are possible: Anyone who has used blue-chip DeFi protocols knows that you can harmonize financial innovation and self-custodial key management.  Ironically, the emergence of DeFi – which caused users to pull their coins off exchanges so that they could deploy them directly on-chain – did far more for individual self-custody than the Bitcoin preachers ever did. Tens of millions of people use MetaMask, while no widely used equivalent wallet for bitcoin even exists – as there’s no DeFi applications to use it with.  Maximalists interested in a better managed credit sector won’t achieve anything by bleating to each other about the dangers of crypto lenders. If everything is a scam to them, their warnings contain no information. They cannot extinguish the demand for credit or yield – and entrepreneurs will always emerge to fill this need.  Instead, they should start their own financial institutions, using bitcoin as a neo-gold with superior collateral qualities and setting reasonable underwriting standards. It is a mistake to view bitcoin’s success as trade-off against the creation of credit. Its future depends on it.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/20/the-credit-crunch-is-not-the-end-of-crypto-lending,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c7dc7e19d149e909353894e47f1ff6877de8437-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Stablecoins are designed to be pegged to the value of a ""stable"" asset such as fiat currencies. The legislation could be voted on by Waters' panel by next week if the deal is agreed upon, but it may not even come to fruition as Sherrod Brown (D., OH), who chairs the chamber's banking committee, hasn't taken part in the legislation's negotiations, the people said, as reported by the WSJ . Waters and Henry's bill would put the Federal Reserve at the center of regulating stablecoin issuers like Circle, the issuer of Tether ( USDT-USD ). The proposed restrictions would prohibit nonfinancial firms from issuing stablecoins and hence being regulated similarly to banks, the WSJ noted. The Biden administration last year highlighted the desire for tight bank-like regulations . Envisions for tougher oversight on stablecoins followed the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUST ( UST-USD ), which de-pegged from the U.S. dollar in May resulting in financial contagion effects setting in across the broader digital asset space.

This recovery has brought more money into the market, which has helped push the price even further. As bitcoin trends at $23,000, there is significant resistance mounting up ahead, presenting various important technical levels. Bitcoin Must Beat $25,500 Even though bitcoin is making its way towards $24,000 in a tremendous bull trend, there are still some technical levels that the digital asset must beat in order to fully establish its arrival in a bull market. An example was the resistance that mounted at $22,000, but the fight was far from over.

Presently, bitcoin faces the most opposition when it inevitably makes its break above $25,000. The resistance at $25,500 is so prominent that any sign of sell-offs will turn the tide in favor of the bears. An even more important point is at $28,000. This is because the price point was a yearly low level in 2021. As such, it has become a level to hold for both bulls and bears, depending on what direction they wish to drag the cryptocurrency in. BTC recovers close to $24,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com So even though bitcoin had seen some trouble breaking out of the consolidation range high of $23,000, it was not the hardest level to beat for the asset. This means that bitcoin’s hold on its current price level remains shaky at best. If it is unable to hold and falls back down below $22,000, there is every possibility that its price will fall to $19,000, which is where the next significant support levels lie. It is also the support level that propped up its price through the rough early June market.

The company is scheduled to report after the stock market closes on Wednesday.  Johnson's calculation assumes Tesla hasn’t sold or added to its bitcoin (BTC) holdings in the quarter, something it hasn’t done since the first quarter of last year.  Tesla first bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in January 2021 when the cryptocurrency was selling for $32,000 to $33,000. Tesla sold about 10% of its holdings later in that first quarter, but hasn't bought or sold any of its bitcoin since then.  With bitcoin ending the second quarter at $18,731, Johnson, who is bearish on Tesla, expects the company to take a noncash, impairment charge on its total holdings of about $460 million, or roughly 40 cents a share.  According to accounting rules for digital assets, if the price of an asset falls during a quarter, a company must take an impairment charge. But if the price increases, it isn't reported as a gain unless the asset is sold.  Overall, Johnson kept his underweight rating on Tesla, but raised his price target to $380 from $370 based on slightly higher earnings estimates overall.  Analysts polled by FactSet expect Tesla to report adjusted earnings of $1.81 a share on $16.5 billion in sales for the second quarter.  Tesla's stock was trading up 0.6% to $741.03 Wednesday.

42395146,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXPTa,1658335359,UK Markets Bill Extends Banking Rules to Crypto Assets,"The U.K. Treasury has unveiled its proposed digital asset legislation a day before members of Parliament plan to begin debate on the measures.  According to a copy of the legislation published online, existing rules for banking and payment systems will be modified or extended to cover digital assets. The proposed regulations are part of a 335-page financial services and markets bill aimed at strengthening the U.K. financial systems following the country’s exit from the European Union.  In the bill, cryptocurrencies are referred to as “digital settlement assets,” (DSAs), meaning “a digital representation of value or rights.” The rules will largely apply to stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose prices are pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar, along with other digital assets used for payments or settlements. The definition of DSAs laid out in the file also include digital assets used for payments that aren’t “cryptographically secured.”  The rules come on the heels of a turbulent few months for crypto markets that saw a number of prominent crypto companies collapse and around $2 trillion leave the industry. The regulation also follows a promise from the U.K. government to turn the nation into a crypto hub before a series of cabinet resignations threatened to put regulatory plans on hold.  A Treasury consultation published in May hinted at bringing stablecoins under the U.K. payments regulation. Before his resignation in early July, John Glen, a minister of state at the Treasury, said that bringing stablecoins under the payments system will “enable consumers to use stablecoin payment services with confidence.”  The DSA regulations, organized under Schedule 6 in the new bill, propose amendments to the U.K. Banking Act 2009 that establishes the central bank’s oversight of payment systems. It also looks to extend a section of the existing Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013 to payment systems involving DSAs.  The rules look to apply amendments to the banking act via “DSA service providers,” which include digital asset issuers, exchange platforms, wallet providers as well as any person that “sets rules, standards, or conditions of access or participation in relation to the payment system.”  According to the document, the Treasury retains the power to make and modify the regulations presented in the file as it considers appropriate. It also says that the Treasury must consult U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Bank of England and other applicable payments regulatory bodies before making regulations laid out in Schedule 6.  The Treasury could target a DSA service provider for regulatory action within the U.K. using what it called a “recognition order” if the services provided (or disruptions in providing services) are likely to threaten financial stability or have “serious consequences for business or other interests” throughout the country.

42395152,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXPaT,1658332040,Matter Labs Schedules zkSync 2.0 Mainnet Launch for October,"Matter Labs, the company behind the zero-knowledge rollup zkSync, on Wednesday said it plans to launch zkSync 2.0 to Ethereum’s mainnet in 100 days.  With the announcement came the release of a full zkSync roadmap and other details about the project’s upcoming milestones.  zkSync 2.0, a so-called zkEVM, is a kind of Ethereum scaling solution – a “zero knowledge rollup” – that aims to decrease Ethereum’s high fees and increase the network’s transaction capacity. In comparison to so-called Optimistic rollups, Zero Knowledge rollups like zkSync are considered superior, albeit far more complex for engineers to implement.  Read more: Ethereum’s Rollups Aren’t All Built the Same  zkSync is among the companies that have already employed Zero Knowledge technology for a handful of more restricted use cases like token swaps and non-fungible token (NFT) transfers. But no general ZK Rollup – one which can handle any Ethereum smart contract – exists yet on Ethereum.  With its announcement, Matter Labs insists that it will be the first team to bring a fully EVM-compatible zero knowledge rollup to market – a zkEVM. In other words, the team says it will be the first to introduce a rollup that can handle any Ethereum smart contract, meaning developers will be able to build atop zkSync just as they would Ethereum’s clunkier main network.  Read more: The Sudden Rise of EVM Compatible ZK Rollups  “We've been pretty quiet for the entire existence of the company and the product [because] we've been doing a lot of R&D work, and R&D work is unpredictable,” Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski told CoinDesk.  “We're on the cutting edge of innovation in the ZK space.” he continued. “There were a lot of challenges and we didn't want to commit to something that we can't deliver. But now we are changing this and going out with the public roadmap. The challenges are really solved, to the degree where we are very, very confident that we're going to hit the next milestones.”  What is a zkEVM?  The zkEVM technology will mark a paradigm shift in the Ethereum scaling landscape, but until recently it was still thought to be several years away.  In general, rollups work by allowing users to transact on a separate, layer 2 network that exists separate from a (generally) slower, more expensive layer 1, or base, blockchain. Transactions on the layer 2 network get bundled up and passed down to layer 1, where they are officially settled.  Because the Ethereum rollup transactions are “settled” on the main blockchain network, they share its essential security guarantees  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin explained it best in a blog post: “Rollups move computation (and state storage) off-chain, but keep some data per transaction on-chain. To improve efficiency, they use a whole host of fancy compression tricks to replace data with computation wherever possible.”  ZK rollups work using so-called ZK-SNARKS – a type of cryptographic tool, or “proof,” that allows a person to confirm a statement by only looking at a bite-sized, encoded version of it. Zero Knowledge technology allows rollups to bundle up and shrink down large quantities of layer 2 transactions before passing them back down to layer 1.  A layer 1 network only needs to see a small, encrypted representation of ZK rollup transactions – not the transactions themselves – to check that they are legitimate.  The zkEVM Landscape  Wednesday’s announcement from Matter Labs comes on the heels of two others from Scroll and Polygon – both of which are working to launch their own version of a zkEVM at some point in the near future.  Gluchowski thinks that Polygon, which announced Wednesday that it would be the “first” zkEVM to market, was underestimating the amount of time that it will take to move from testing to the real world.  “I know how long it took us from the concept to the first testnet, and from there through multiple iterations. You build this system, you learn a lot about it and it gets a lot more complex than previous versions,” Gluchowski said.  According to Gluchowski, Matter Labs, which launched its zkEVM test net back in February, has a head start.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/20/matter-labs-schedules-zksync-20-mainnet-launch-for-october,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fdb68ebb5c530e02a1efc90bc1a2e781abe5de5d-1333x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421491,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUuL,1658329337,Who Is Building Ethereum's Public Goods?,"I dislike conferences. I’m awkward, almost comically introverted and pathologically incapable of striking up a conversation with strangers (sober). It’s an ordeal. My recent decision to attend ETHBarcelona overrode these factors because my intuition told me this was a statement conference about what I recently termed “hyperregen.”  I had to attend. I needed to confirm whether I was imagining this trend or whether it was really there, something you could recognize in the faces of the attendees, raw and uncensored. Not just part of the memetics of Crypto Twitter.  Paul Dylan-Ennis is a lecturer/assistant professor in the College of Business, University College Dublin.  Hyperregen is my term for an emerging and overarching metanarrative of contemporary Ethereum culture. It names the trend, evident in the past year or two, where Ethereum-based projects and influencers more and more present themselves as advancing a regeneration of culture, art and economics.  In many ways, hyperregen is a response to the market nihilism of “DeFi degens,” but also a response to a broader existential crisis that can afflict people operating in crypto, asking is it really just about the money?  If the answer to “what is Ethereum?” is profit, then we have engaged in an elaborate reproduction of late-stage neoliberal capitalism but with fewer safeguards for retail investors. You might say, crypto degens have been speedrunning the history of finance – finding they’re Lehman Brothers circa 2008.  See also: The One Word That Defines Ethereum's Goals | Paul Dylan-Ennis  ETHBarcelona challenged this and felt like a claim that the real purpose of Ethereum is to act as a laboratory for a broader political project and site of economic experimentation. Although pro-markets, the aim of Web3 isn’t exploitation, but regeneration.  That may explain why so many people who were there were “solarpunks.” What started as a literary genre has been adopted by the hyperregen culture and transformed into an implicative aesthetic. Solarpunks dream of a future that has seamlessly integrated highly advanced technology with lush greenery, a Heaven on Earth.  Presenters discussed Ethereum as a type of shared commons. It’s a space where people can coordinate activities to build large, open systems. You could describe this vision as a type of experimental solarpunk “minarchism,” or a variation of libertarianism that wants most things run by communities and outside control of the state.  In Ethereum hyperregen culture, minarchism comes in the form of an alternative, decentralized mechanism of public goods funding, so that we don’t have to be reliant on governments or corporations.  Griff Green, founder of decentralized charity platform Giveth, argued the state justifies its negatives (surveillance, overtaxation, etc.) with its positives (roads, parks, etc.). Crypto’s hyperregen tactic is to wither away the state’s stranglehold on the positives until all that is left is the negative, undercutting any justification for the existence of the state at all.  This is a deeply agorist position in the style of Samuel Konkin III, who advocated for the parallel creation of left libertarian enclaves that compete with the state, eroding its contiguous territory until the state evaporates.  Like Konkin, hyperregen is acutely aware that a post-state world cannot be achieved with a right libertarian mindset because the free-rider problem ensures necessary public goods go unprovided or neglected. In Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s words:  “Given that a purist ‘private property rights only’ libertarianism inevitably runs into large problems like its inability to fund public goods, any successful pro-freedom program in the 21st century has to be a hybrid containing at least one Big Compromise Idea that solves at least 80% of the problems, so that independent individual initiative can take care of the rest.”  My impression at ETHBarcelona is that the Big Compromise Idea is the climate crisis. The solution, as I took it, is that skeptics of collective solutions, like those required for climate change, could be swayed by the effectiveness of decentralized solarpunk coordination.  This is what Konkin suggested as an agorist tactic: You don’t wait for permission, but permissionlessly build the alternative in parallel and through your constructions reveal the attraction of the post-state alternative.  Easily the most advanced thinking on solarpunk coordination comes from Scott Moore, the founder of Web3 funding vehicle Gitcoin. Moore argues not necessarily against traditional states or corporations but the idea that they represent the only coordination mechanisms for shared social problems.  See also: Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Paul Dylan-Ennis  Instead, we should recognize our already-existing coordination tooling (quadratic funding, retroactive public goods funding, multisigs, etc.) and incentivization mechanisms (currencies, tokens, soulbound tokens, airdrops, etc.) are examples of successful economic, social and political organization at local scale that can be scaled up.  In both Green and Moore, the meta-argument is agorist: to not just generate positive externalities beyond Ethereum but begin organizing beyond Ethereum itself.  Finally, the “lunarpunk” tendency, represented (all-too) briefly at ETHBarcelona by Amir Taaki, argues that whatever direction we are heading, anonymity must be embedded into our practices.  Right after Taaki’s talk, a panel of EU regulators closed out the event, but I couldn’t help but feel the order here was wrong, giving second billing to a more radical vision.

42395167,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXPiL,1658329245,"Coinbase Had No Financial Exposure to Troubled Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, Voyager","Publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) had no financing exposure to crypto lender Celsius Network, hedge fund Three Arrows Capital or crypto broker Voyager Digital, according to a Coinbase blog post on Medium on Wednesday. All three troubled firms are seeking bankruptcy protection.  “We have not engaged in these types of risky lending practices and instead have focused on building our financing business with prudence and deliberate focus on the client,” wrote Coinbase Institutional head Brett Tejpaul, Prime finance head Matt Boyd and Credit and Market Risk head Caroline Tarick.  “The shocks to the crypto credit environment over the last few weeks are likely to be a major inflection point for the industry,” wrote the group. “Notably, the issues here were foreseeable and actually credit specific, not crypto specific in nature. Many of these firms were overleveraged with short-term liabilities mismatched against longer-duration illiquid assets.”  However, in a footnote to the post, the group said that while Coinbase “does not have counterparty exposure” to Celsius, Three Arrows and Voyager, “Coinbase’s venture program did make non-material investments in Terraform Labs.”  The crypto industry has been hit this year with the $40 billion collapse of Terraform Labs algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) and its sister coin LUNA in May, a British Virgin Islands court ordering the liquidation of Three Arrows Capital at the beginning of July followed by Voyager Digital seeking bankruptcy protection, and Celsius seeking bankruptcy protection on July 13 with a $1.3 billion hole in its balance sheet.  Despite Coinbase avoiding counterparty risk from the three companies, the publicly traded crypto exchange has still been significantly hurt by the sharp decline in crypto prices, with shares plunging nearly 74% year to date. In May, Coinbase said it would scale back hiring, which was followed by rescinded job offers and plans to cut 18% of the global workforce. Ratings agency Moody’s downgraded Coinbase’s corporate debt late last month on profitability concerns.

Two of the currencies that have seen a considerable increase over the past seven days are Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX). Investors are also optimistic as a result of the cryptocurrency market’s recent growth trends. According to CoinGecko data, SOL is currently trading at $45.04 and has experienced a significant 7-day rise of 37.2 %. While it is still down 82% from its peak of $259.96 on November 6, 2021, approximately nine months ago. Related Reading | An Interview with Ben Caselin on AAX- Lightning Network Integration and TARO Protocol Implementation With a spectacular rise of 49.4% over the past seven days, AVAX excelled. As a result, its current price, $25.29, has increased by 5.8% during the last 24 hours. It is also 82% below its ATM of $144.96 on November 21, 2021, which was eight months ago. The Crypto Market Shows Signs Of Recovery “Crypto winter” is without a doubt the phrase that every crypto trader is uttering right now. After reaching a high of $3 trillion in 2021, the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies had a sharp decline, down to $1 trillion, a loss of around $2 trillion. In the history of cryptocurrency, there have been a number of well-known bear markets. Still, the one in 2022 is particularly noteworthy due to the extreme testing of decentralized financial systems and the excessive use of trading leverage. However, the intense storm is now gradually winding down. Along with other encouraging economic data, the recent increase in cryptocurrency prices in mid-July suggests that the bear market is slowly reversing and that the cryptocurrency industry is on the way to recovery. Solana And Avalanche On Recovery Most coins strive to become better ones of themselves in order to find fortune and increase in value. As these cryptocurrencies grow, investors will view them as more reliable, which will boost their attractiveness. That is why Avalanche’s (AVAX) recent price rise may be gearing up to reclaim its worth. The crypto community believes the Avalanche currency may make a comeback this month as it has just achieved a solid recovery from its June low of $13. AVAX is a blockchain system that is rising in recognition as an Ethereum rival. The coin has also shown that it has the capacity to succeed as well as the resources needed to recover even under pressure.

Additionally, it still needs assistance to recover its value and reach a high of $95 in May. Furthermore, according to a group of fintech experts from Finder.com, Solana (SOL) will see a value increase to $45 by the end of 2022. The panel forecasts that SOL will be valued at around $166 in 2025 and $512 in 2030.

42395153,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXPZU,1658324652,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Nears $24K as Zipmex Suspends Withdrawals,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (First Mover lead author Lyllah Ledesma is in Paris for the EthCC conference. Stay tuned later in the week for her dispatch from the conference.)  Price Point: Bitcoin's latest rally takes price toward $24,000.  Zipmex becomes latest crypto-industry casualty, suspending withdrawals, Omkar Godbole reports.  There's something missing at the Federal Reserve these days: urgency. Helene Braun examines how the Jerome Powell Fed is different from the Paul Volcker Fed in the 1980s.  Market Moves: Solana wallet growth is outpacing that of rivals, Shaurya Malwa reports.  This web version of today's First Mover newsletter was produced by Sage D. Young.  Price point  A rally in crypto markets over the past couple weeks has suddenly built into something substantial, with bitcoin (BTC) climbing to its highest price in a month, now approaching $24,000. The cryptocurrency has traded higher on seven of the past eight days.  Analysts attribute the recent gains to speculation that the Federal Reserve won't be as aggressive in tightening monetary conditions as feared just a couple weeks ago, Shaurya Malwa reports. For most of this year, the Fed has been raising interest rates to tamp down inflation running at its fastest pace in four decades, and the expectation of higher borrowing costs have been pushing down valuations for risky assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  Our economics reporter, Helene Braun, published a fascinating story showing how the Fed hasn't been this far behind the curve on fighting inflation for decades, and some top economists say the situation is looking precarious. Braun dug through transcripts of Federal Reserve meetings during the 1980s – the last major inflation flare-up – to illustrate just how worried members of the Paul Volcker-led central bank were at that time. Such urgency appears missing from the current Jerome Powell-led Fed, at least for now.  With that as the backdrop, there's always the possibility that the Fed might be forced to address the growing risk that the soaring inflation turns into a real emergency.  Crypto analysts remain cautious despite the recent vigor creeping into the market.  “If the upside momentum stalls, as it did in February and March this year, we should be prepared for a sharp increase in selling,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, wrote in an email.  Despite the rally, the bitcoin price is still just one-third of its all-time high price of $69,000 reached in late 2021, and the crypto industry continues to suffer. Wednesday brought fresh news of another player suffering from the market downturn, with the exchange Zipmex suspending withdrawals, as reported by Omkar Godbole.  Elsewhere in digital-asset markets, dogecoin’s DOGE surged 11%, leading gains among major cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours. No technical catalysts for the move seemed to exist, but developers for the network polled community members for their opinions on a Dogecoin-centric hackathon event in November – which may suggest future technical development.  Prices of Cardano’s ADA and XRP rose as much as 8%. BNB added 2.7%, while Solana’s SOL traded flat after a nearly 30% rally over the past week. Total crypto market capitalization increased 4%, rising above $1.1 trillion.  Outside of majors, ApeCoin’s APE surged 8% as buying momentum from last week’s metaverse game demo continued. Shiba Inu’s SHIB jumped 10% despite the lack of a technical catalyst.  In traditional markets, U.S. equity futures were wavering. Traders were awaiting a report on U.S. home sales, and European officials rolled out a plan to ration supplies of natural gas amid warnings of disruptions of Russian supplies.

Figures for “New Daily Addresses” on Solana consistently grew its user base throughout the bear market, research by CoinMarketCap that cited data from Glassnode and The Block showed.  New Daily Addresses refer to first-time wallet users on any blockchain network, which can signal growth and adoption. On Solana, new users peaked at over 400,000 in May before gradually declining to 240,000 users this week. These figures are a jump from December 2021’s levels of 150,000 to 170,000 new users each day.  Daily active wallets have similarly climbed this year, with over 32 million active users in June and 37 million in May. This rose from an average of 20 million active users in the first four months of 2022.  However, data suggests the activity did not amount to inflows. Total value locked (TVL) on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications running on Solana dropped to $2.9 billion this week from May’s $6 billion figure. Solana TVL peaked at $14 billion in December 2021.  Solana’s native SOL tokens have grown amid rising wallet usage. The tokens added nearly 34% over the past week and are up 30% in the past month, despite market-wide declines and volatility. In comparison, bitcoin (BTC) has risen by 14% in the past month.

Bithumb, Upbit, Coinone and four other local exchanges have been raided alongside eight residential and office addresses, the report said.  TerraUSD fell dramatically off its U.S. dollar-peg in May, causing an industry-wide fallout that saw several hedge funds and exchanges fall victim to overexposure.  Investigators are now seizing material from the raids in order to ascertain whether Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon is guilty of intentionally causing the collapse of UST and LUNA.  In May, Korean police moved to freeze Terraform Labs' assets to prevent the company from embezzling funds that may be considered fraudulent.

42395162,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXPgN,1658322000,AI-Based Startup Optic Raises $11M to Put the ‘NF’ in NFTs,"Optic, a startup that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to authenticate non-fungible tokens (NFTs), unveiled its business on Wednesday and raised $11 million in a seed round led by Kleiner Perkins and crypto-native investment giant Pantera Capital. The company will use the funds toward building out the cost-intensive infrastructure and hiring engineering talent, Optic co-founder and CEO Andrey Doronichev told CoinDesk in an interview.  Other investors in the round included Lattice Capital, OpenSea, Circle, Polygon, CoinDCX, Neon DAO and Flamingo DAO, among others.  NFTs are crypto assets with unique on-chain addresses that grant a collector or gamer ownership of that image, video, music or in-game asset, to name a few NFT use cases.  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  Doronichev explained that while an NFT technically is made unique by the on-chain address, its surface-level appearance to the human eye can be indistinguishable from a counterfeit.  “Without Optic, there is no real ‘NF’ in NFT,” Doronichev said.  NFT authentication  Founded in March, San Francisco-based Optic is developing an AI engine that processes the millions of new NFTs minted each day and compares the works to existing NFT collections. Optic looks for visually similarities, including flipped images, color changes or slight distortions or fuzziness. The monitoring tool informs marketplaces, brands or media companies about potential intellectual property violations.  Optic displays a percentage for how much the token matches existing NFT collections with a higher number representing the closest match and the most likely instance of an outright counterfeit. A score under 95% means the NFT probably includes inspired or derivative art, Doronichev said.  Optic’s Marketplace Moderation tool is currently used by NFT giant OpenSea as part of the company's efforts to crack down on fraud.  “Optic isn’t an enforcement business,” said Doronichev. “Our goal is to make the information available and transparent to the ecosystem. Artists and marketplaces can decide what to do with it.”  Doronichev formerly worked as a product director at Google and led the YouTube Mobile team at a time when the video platform was building its counterfeit-fighting ContentID system. He cofounded Optic with AI researchers Roman Doronin and Vlad Vinogradov, who founded Eora Data Lab, an AI studio that delivered projects for the likes of PepsiCo and Yandex.  Road Map  Optic’s near-term road map includes plans for a public application programming interface (API) for Web3 developers and new tools for NFT creators and collectors.  “People think of authenticity and all sorts of fraud and trust issues in the NFT space as a problem of a single marketplace or a single chain or a single creator or community,"" said Doronichev. ""That's not true. That's a systemic ecosystem issue, and it has to be addressed.""",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MATIC,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/20/ai-based-startup-optic-raises-11m-to-put-the-nf-in-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9628d0e2c59c67ed863aeff95ff3541bbad2dbe-3598x2699.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We're making the assumption that this rally will fail or fade, not too far from current levels,"" the founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies told CNBC. Calling the current situation ""a proving ground"" for the market, Stockton pointed to signals that the rebound from June's low, when the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) reached a 52-week low just above 3,600, has started to run out of steam. Specifically, she noted that risk assets have ""now come into resistance"" and the market has seen the return of short-term overbought signals. This included megacaps experiencing overbought conditions headed into their earnings reports. At the same time, the Fairlead founder argued that the market hasn't experienced ""any incremental improvements in long-term indicators,"" suggesting that the bear market will likely continue to dominate trading. ""So far, there's some incremental improvement but not enough to suggest that we have some lasting relief rally,"" she said. Assessing the longer-term market, Stockton argued that there was a high probability that the S&P 500 would drop below the June low. She estimated that there was a ""closer to 10%"" chance that the market has reached a ""longer-term major low"" signaling an ""end to the bear market cycle."" To support this view, the Fairlead founder spotlighted recent action in the cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has climbed about 18% since the end of June. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has jumped about 46% during that time, with Stockton pointing out even more aggressive action in altcoins. ""I think there is a risk appetite out there,"" she noted. ""It's not that kind of despair that we would expect after this bear-market cycle culminates.""

The Sandbox allows users to monetize their activity on blockchain-based virtual lands. However, NFT projects and communities have faced several exploits and frauds in the past few months, which has increased the need for more vigilance.  “In the open metaverse, users should be able to enjoy their true digital ownership rights and have new ways to create, store and trade value while having fun rather than having to worry about online threats,” Sebastien Borget, chief operations officer of The Sandbox, said in an email.  “With its ability to monitor and protect against these attacks, BrandShield is a strategic partner to help identify faster and take down phishing attacks and various online threats from brand impersonators and bad actors,” Borget added.  BrandShield analyses and classifies various threats to eliminate attacks on crypto wallets. It also evaluates threat levels from different digital entities and platforms, such as websites and NFT marketplaces, to find threats that would otherwise be undetectable by traditional cybersecurity technology.  In March and April, BrandShield neutralized 120 phishing sites and 58 fake social media accounts impersonating the metaverse platform, allowing The Sandbox’s economy to operate securely, The Sandbox said.  Meanwhile, Borget told CoinDesk that The Sandbox will also start educating its users about fraud prevention methods.  “Our primary focus is on educating our community and guiding them through our community managers and customer support,” he said. “Since the wallet is where their identification and ownership are stored, not on our servers, we must provide best practices and guidelines for our players and creators so they can remain vigilant against all external threats.""",POSITIVE,없음,OTHER,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/20/the-sandbox-brings-on-security-firm-brandshield-to-prevent-rising-nft-frauds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31b47272acfd6aed6f84de370088c6c7fc9a83e5-1200x900.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Polygon Announces The Launch Of zkEVM According to an official press release from today, Polygon said zkEVM would be the “first Ethereum-equivalent scaling solution that works seamlessly with all existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets, harnessing advanced cryptography called Zero-Knowledge proofs.” The new scaling solution will be compatible with all existing Ethereum applications and emulate the Ethereum Virtual Machine at the op-code level. Developers will now be able to launch their projects using Ethereum’s programming language. Additionally, existing Ethereum tooling, such as the MetaMask wallet and development environments like Hardhat, will also be compatible with Polygon Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine. Commenting on the development, Mihailo Bjelic, co-founder of Polygon, said: “The holy grail of Web3 infrastructure should have three major properties: scalability, security and Ethereum-compatibility,” he said. “Until now, it has not been practically possible to offer all these properties at once. Polygon zkEVM is a breakthrough technology that finally achieves that, thus opening a new chapter of mass adoption,” Bjelic added. Ethereum’s transaction capacity is currently at around only 15 transactions per second. Rollups like Polygon zkEVM allow Ethereum to boost the network’s capabilities by transacting quickly and cheaply without compromising the network’s most essential security. The new offering will use Zero-Knowledge Rollups to batch transactions and confirm them on the Ethereum mainnet. As a result, gas fees on Polygon Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine will be significantly lower than Ethereum mainnet and eventually on the Polygon network.

Quoine, which operates crypto exchange Liquid, collected and stored data for know-your-client (KYC) checks. Quoine Fined For Breaching Over 650,000 Customers’ Data According to a report from the Straits Times, the stolen data included full names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers, including documents such as photos and scans of NRICs and passports. Transaction information and bank account details were also leaked. The customer data breach occurred in November 2020 after a staff member at a third-party domain provider engaged by Quoine fell for a social engineering attack and incorrectly transferred control of the domain hosting account to the culprit. Even though the initial breach occurred at the company’s third-party domain provider, the Personal Data Protection Commission Singapore (PDPC) found that Quoine bore responsibility for the poor security of the DevOps account. “The organization suggested that the DevOps account’s security risk profile had not been assessed, probably due to its intended use as an automation account. This was not accepted,” the commission said. “The organization is not exempted from assessing the security implications and risks of the DevOps account simply on the basis that it was an automation account, especially considering that the DevOps account could be used to access the customer data stored in the databases,” it added. In deciding the penalty, PDPC said it took into account mitigating factors, such as how Quoine took prompt remedial actions, including notifying the affected individuals.

42393810,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBMJ3,1658316900,The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups,"Last week, the news that Ethereum’s long-awaited transition to proof-of-stake might finally come in September evoked as many “I’ll believe it when I see it” jeers as it did cheers.  But not everything on Ethereum is behind schedule. EthCC, a major Ethereum conference, took place in Paris this past week. With it came a trio of major announcements (and announcements of major announcements) from Polygon, Matter Labs and Scroll.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Each team appears to be in the home stretch of launching a zkEVM (zero knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine), a kind of technology – once thought to be years away – that will allow users to transact on Ethereum with lower fees and shorter delays.  It’s no secret that using Ethereum is expensive and slow relative to other blockchain networks. The chain can only handle around 15 transactions per second, which is orders of magnitude below alternative blockchains like Solana and Tezos. And at periods of high traffic, Ethereum transaction fees can make the network prohibitively expensive for most use-cases (think $40 for a simple token swap).  A year ago, so-called Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism were heralded as the best way around Ethereum’s sluggish and expensive user experience. But Optimistic rollups were only a band-aid solution, and it appears their core technology may be eclipsed sooner than expected with the upcoming launch of zkEVMs.  Read more: Ethereum’s Rollups Aren’t All Built the Same  Zero knowledge of zero knowledge? Not a problem. In this week’s edition of Valid Points, we’ll do our best to walk you through what zkEVMs are and what they mean for the future of Ethereum.  Understanding Ethereum rollups  Understanding zkEVMs means understanding two core blockchain concepts: rollups and zero-knowledge proofs.  Those who have been reading this newsletter for a while will know that rollups are the main way that Ethereum developers are working to scale the network – meaning cheapening fees and increasing transaction speeds and throughput. Rollups typically achieve this by establishing a layer 2, or subsidiary, blockchain atop Ethereum’s layer 1, or base blockchain, mainnet.  These layer 2 networks process transactions, bundle them up and pass them back down to the layer 1 network in some sort of compressed format. Once on the layer 1 chain, the transactions can be confirmed using fancy computer science or other mechanics.  As Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin explained in a blog post, “Rollups move computation (and state storage) off-chain, but keep some data per transaction on-chain. To improve efficiency, they use a whole host of fancy compression tricks to replace data with computation wherever possible.”  As a result of these efficiency improvements, rollup chains allow users to use smart contracts – the computer programs that run on blockchains like Ethereum – more quickly and inexpensively.  Since rollup transactions are “settled” on Ethereum’s base layer, they have an added bonus of borrowing the layer 1 chain’s security. (This differs from so-called sidechains, which execute transactions, bundle them up and pass them back down to a layer 1 network with little more than a pinky-promise that the transaction data has not been tampered with.)  Optimistic rollups and ZK rollups  There are generally two ways that rollups – which borrow Ethereum’s security – are constructed: Optimistic rollups and ZK rollups.  Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism use a dispute period – usually around seven days – to ensure transaction truthfulness. In these systems, transactions happen on the layer 2 network, but when they are bundled up and passed back to the layer 1 chain, network actors on the base chain have time (the dispute period) to look things over and make sure the transaction data is what it purports to be.  While a seven-day dispute period can slow down withdrawals (since it takes longer for transactions to officially “settle”), Optimistic rollups are much easier to implement than zero-knowledge rollups, the primary Ethereum scaling alternative. As a result, Optimistic rollups were the first to come to market (Arbitrum and Optimism both launched in 2021).  Zero knowledge or “ZK” rollups use complex mathematics and computer science – rather than a dispute period – to guarantee that transactions that get bundled up and posted to a layer 1 network are “true.” They do this by constructing so-called “zk-SNARKs” – a kind of cryptographic message that “proves” a statement is true without requiring you to walk through it yourself.  Zero-knowledge technology holds a number of advantages over Optimistic technology. Proving that transactions are correct (as ZK rollups do) is more fool-proof than trusting people to reject malicious transactions within a certain time window (as is required with Optimistic rollups).  The zkEVM  If ZK rollups sound complicated, that’s because they are. Teams have worked for years to figure out how to distill complex transactions into easy-to-verify proofs – a problem that was expected to take at least a couple more years to crack.  In the interim, it has generally been thought that ZK technology would only be practically useful for more simple use cases, like sending tokens between blockchain addresses. Companies like StarkWare and Matter Labs launched tools allowing projects to leverage ZK technology for a small set of applications, but they have yet to translate more complex operations – those used by most smart-contract based applications – into zero-knowledge proofs.  In his 2021 rollup primer, Buterin wrote, “In general, my own view is that in the short term, Optimistic rollups are likely to win out for general-purpose EVM computation and ZK rollups are likely to win out for simple payments, exchange and other application-specific use cases, but in the medium to long term ZK rollups will win out in all use cases as ZK-SNARK technology improves.”  The “medium to long term” time frame seems to have moved up significantly with the advent of the zkEVM.  Read more: Polygon Deploys ZK Rollup Testnet; Eyes Mainnet Launch  The rollup Holy Grail – the so-called zkEVM – allows developers to port any Ethereum smart contract over to a ZK rollup chain without needing to alter their underlying code.  There are some differences between different kinds of zkEVMs being worked on by Polygon, Matter Labs and Scroll, but in general they promise to dramatically reduce fees and transaction speeds for virtually any use-case – even relative to Optimistic rollup solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism.  State of Optimistic rollups  Optimistic rollups came about at a time when they seemed like the only realistic solution for Ethereum to scale.  The average transaction fee on Ethereum is currently about 81 cents, according to ycharts.com. Compare this to the two largest Optimistic rollups: Arbitrum and Optimism. Here, the average fees are 11 cents and 13 cents, respectively, according to L2Fees.info.  Though they work well at slicing fees, Optimistic rollups haven’t seen enough adoption to signal that they’ve truly “scaled” Ethereum.  Though rollups have been around for several months, Ethereum maintains a sizable lead in daily transactions: There were 1.2 million Ethereum transactions on July 18 compared to fewer than 250,000 across Arbitrum and Optimism.  A look at the value of cryptocurrency committed to Optimistic rollups, often referred to as total value locked (TVL), is an important indicator of a rollup’s health. Arbitrum and Optimism have around $1 billion in combined total value locked, according to DeFi Llama. This might seem like a lot, but it pales in comparison to the $55 billion locked on Ethereum.  What happens to Optimistic rollups?  On top of this lagging adoption, we’re now seeing the rise of the zkEVM – a technology which aims to improve upon Optimistic rollups across almost every metric. So what now for the Optimistic rollup?  One potential future pathway forward for Optimistic chains is to transition over to zero-knowledge technology.  As Buterin put it on a primer on YouTube: “I personally would much rather trust $10 million of my own money to an EVM Optimistic rollup than to an EVM ZK rollup for at least the next couple of years. But in the long term ZK rollups are, I think, going to be everything. And so, my advice to teams like Optimism and Arbitrum is that I think they should start ZK-ifying themselves fairly soon.”  Another path forward for these chains is to work on serving other use-cases, even if this means sacrificing some security.  Last week on July 11, Arbitrum introduced a chain called Arbitrum Nova, intended for gaming and social applications, leaving its original mainnet to service non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Nova – which is built using Arbitrum’s AnyTrust technology – offers transactions almost for free, albeit with some compromises to its security model (not unlike most other low-fee blockchains).  And finally, Justin Drake – a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation who has partnered with teams like Scroll and Matter Labs on their zero-knowledge protocols – points to community as a potential saving grace for protocols like Optimism and Arbitrum.  “It turns out that in this space, oftentimes it is not just about technology. Sometimes, it’s the network effects – the culture of the community – that is actually the most important thing. I think a team like Optimism really got a lot of things right from that perspective,” Drake told CoinDesk.  In May, Optimism formed a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), dubbed Optimism Collective and airdropped their OP token, which grants token holders the capability to determine protocol incentives and vote on protocol upgrades. Though the token drop was not without hiccups, Optimism’s unique governance model earned widespread praise throughout the Ethereum community – including from Buterin.  Sage D.

As a result, Mr. Chang’s stake in Wemade reached 1.5%. Wemade shifted its focus towards metaverse and blockchain technology with an emphasis on developing and servicing well-made games with economically meaningful experiences. As a result, Wemade developed “Wemix”, a game-centric blockchain platform (with 14 Play & Earn titles), that provides services including cryptocurrency wallet, NFT auction & marketplace, staking, and more, based on its utility coin WEMIX. This is not the first time Mr. Chang has shown his dedication to the firm. In fact, he announced earlier this year his pledge to invest all his present salary and dividends in WEMIX coin. Wemade announced on June 24th that Mr. Chang’s purchase of 13,424.6 WEMIX coins (worth USD 38,125.86) with the salary he received from the same month. This brings his total investment to 51,258.354 WEMIX coins (worth USD 145,573.7). This is also the fourth time he invested his salary in WEMIX Coin, in addition to his dividends from last year. Mr. Chang has constantly fulfilled his promise to contribute his compensation to the sustainable development of Wemix ecosystem. He also stressed that he does not plan to sell a single share nor a single WEMIX coin. CEO compensation packages are part of corporate governance mechanisms. Companies often offer their CEOs stock options that tie CEO’s compensation to the company’s stock performance which creates incentives for CEOs to manage the firm and work hard in ways that maximize firm market value. Often misunderstood, stock options are criticized for inducing top management to pursue strategies that only push the stock price up in the short term. This would benefit opportunist CEOs who time the exercise of their stock options to when the stock price is high and sell their newly acquired shares at a premium. Mr. Chang is one of the very few CEOs in South Korea to invest in his company’s stock despite very high volatility in the capital markets. Mr. Chang’s move is highly contrary to a few CEOs who exercised their stock options to sell the shares last year, only six to twelve months after the companies were listed. In contrast, there are often publicized cases where executives conducted massive selloffs of shares received from their stock options which enraged minority shareholders. The shareholder sentiment is especially strong when it takes place soon after the company goes public and draws a misconnection between the shareholders and the leaders. However, Mr. Chang’s move is exactly the opposite. Mr. Chang reiterated his engagement in the firm’s long-term success and shareholder value. His dedication and hard work led Wemade to new heights. Recently the company announced USD 131 million in sales revenue for the first quarter of 2022 alone. This represents an astonishing 72% increase compared to last year. MIR4, Wemade’s flagship P&E MMORPG (from the Legend of Mir series) gathered 6.5 million active users within a few months of its global launch in 12 languages and 170 countries. Its successor MIR M topped Google Play’s popularity chart after its release in South Korea in June 2022. The highly anticipated global P&E version will be launched within the year. Since Mr. Chang’s commitment has no limit, Wemade is expected to continue its winning strike with more achievements in both its video game development and publishing services and its blockchain ecosystem.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/henry-chang-the-most-dedicated-ceo-in-south-korea-leads-wemade-to-new-heights/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42395161,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXPfO,1658315400,"Polygon Readies ZK Rollup Testnet, Eyes Mainnet Launch in 2023","At the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris on Tuesday, Ethereum scaling tool Polygon announced Polygon zkEVM, which the company described as a ""major leap forward"" in the world of zero-knowledge (ZK) technology.  In a press release, Polygon said zkEVM would be the “first Ethereum-equivalent scaling solution that works seamlessly with all existing smart contracts, developer tools and wallets, harnessing advanced cryptography called zero-knowledge proofs.”  Ethereum’s transaction capacity (around 15 transactions per second) is lower than rival blockchains like Solana and Tezos, and its high gas fees have rendered it prohibitively expensive for a variety of use cases (think $40 currency exchange fees).  Rollups like Polygon zkEVM are the main way the Ethereum community is working to boost the network’s capabilities – allowing users to transact quickly and cheaply without compromising the network’s most essential security guarantees.  There are two main types of rollups: Optimistic and zero knowledge. Of the two, zero knowledge is generally considered the superior technology, but its engineering complexity has caused it to lag behind quicker-to-market Optimistic rollups.  Read more: Ethereum’s Rollups Aren’t All Built the Same  The idea of a fully featured ZK rollup – one that can accommodate any Ethereum smart contract like the current leading Optimistic rollups – was, until recently, thought to be years away.  “Everybody thought [a zkEVM] was at least 12 to 18 months away,” Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal told CoinDesk. ""But here we are, and we are open sourcing the code and making the test net live.”  According to Polygon, the zkEVM test net will launch sometime this summer. A mainnet launch is expected ""early 2023.""  What is a zkEVM?  ZK rollups are powered by so-called circuits – code that can “prove” a statement is true by looking at a bite-sized, encrypted version of it.  Clever ZK circuitry enables large quantities of layer 2 transactions to get bundled up and passed down to a layer 1 chain. Instead of looking at a bunch of transactions one by one, a ZK circuit (code that lives in an Ethereum smart contract) can look at a relatively tiny blob of encoded data to confirm that transactions haven’t been spoofed or altered.  “Generally, until now, it was only possible or feasible to build these use case-specific circuits, Nailwal explained. “For example, a payment [platform], or NFT (non-fungible token) swaps – all these small individual things.”  As a result, Nailwal said, “Current ZK rollups are all restricted in the kind of smart contracts they can provide for.”  This all changes with zkEVMs – ZK rollups that can support all of the same smart contracts as Ethereum’s mainnet.  “A zkEVM is a generic circuit on Ethereum. That means you … can write custom smart contracts the same way you can write them on Ethereum – anything and everything that you want to [program].”  In other words, developers will be able to move virtually any Ethereum smart contract onto Polygon zkEVM without needing to alter its code.  Nailwal said he expects Polygon zkEVM to slice transaction fees by 90% in comparison with Ethereum. He also estimated that the network will be able to support 40 to 50 transactions per second, compared with Ethereum’s approximately 15 transactions per second. Over time, Nailwal said, the team’s Plonky 2 technology – which it announced in January – will be used to boost transaction capacity orders of magnitudes higher.  In Nailwal’s telling, zkEVMs will mark an across-the-board improvement over Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism – the incumbent Ethereum rollup chains that were released last year and have a combined $1 billon in value locked according to DefiLlama.  For now, though, Polygon zkEVM will share one of the major shortcomings of other rollups in that it has a centralized “sequencer,” which means a single party is responsible for bundling up and ordering the layer 2 transactions that get passed down to the layer 1 blockchain.  Polygon says it is working to decentralize this element of its process. For now, though, a dishonest sequencer could theoretically pause a rollup or strategically reorder transactions in order to squeeze some extra profit for himself. If he goes offline, a sequencer can also bring the whole chain down.  But even with these risks, a centralized sequencer is unable to falsify transactions, meaning rollups still hold security advantages relative to other, more centralized scaling products.  What is Polygon?  Until now, Polygon’s main product offering has been Polygon PoS (proof-of-stake), a blockchain that can support Ethereum-compatible transactions for extremely low fees.  Users can easily swap many assets back and forth between Polygon PoS and Ethereum’s mainnet, and the company has positioned it as a way to scale the Ethereum network by serving as an off-ramp for certain kinds of activity. The chain – which is the largest network oriented around scaling Ethereum – has nearly $2 billion in total value locked, according to DefiLlama.  But Polygon PoS is unlike a rollup in that it doesn't borrow Ethereum’s security guarantees. For that reason – and despite some confusion to the contrary – it’s not considered a true “layer 2” network like Polygon zkEVM will be, and its low fees come at the cost of a more centralized security model.  Polygon zkEVM will have higher fees than the company’s PoS chain for the foreseeable future. That means the PoS chain will still be superior for use cases like gaming, which demand the lowest fees possible.  But Nailwal emphasized to CoinDesk that ZK technology is the future, and he says there may be a point at which Polygon manages to retrofit its ZK technology to its PoS chain.  The zero-knowledge landscape  The latest product announcement comes nearly a year after Polygon paid $250 million to merge with Hermez, a company focused on ZK technology that laid the groundwork for much of what ultimately became Polygon zkEVM. According to Nailwal, Polygon committed nearly $1 billion to ZK-related initiatives last year.  But Polygon’s ZK advancements don't exist in a vacuum. Other projects, like Scroll and Matter Labs (the team behind zkSync), are racing to launch their own zkEVMs at some point in the near future.  Polygon issued several tweets this week hinting that a major zkEVM-related announcement would be coming. Polygon’s MATIC token – the native gas token for Polygon’s PoS chain and its upcoming zkEVM chain – is up over 70% in the past seven days.  UPDATE (July 20, 17:23 UTC): Polygon has corrected the launch timeline that it originally provided to CoinDesk in an interview. The network will launch as a test net this summer, not this week as originally stated. The mainnet launch is expected to follow early next year, not in four to ten weeks.",POSITIVE,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/20/polygon-deploys-zk-rollup-testnet-eyes-mainnet-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4bf43a0d24f545b638ea344d535ac69fad82d323-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The rules are part of a long-awaited financial services and markets bill, aimed at strengthening the U.K. financial system post-Brexit, set to be presented to Parliament in the coming hours.  The government has previously said crypto will play a part in the country's broader post-Brexit strategy to increase economic competitiveness. In April, the U.K. Treasury announced a set of initiatives to help turn the country into a global crypto hub. The announcement promised new rules that would let consumers confidently use stablecoins for payments.  But a dramatic crypto market downturn, followed by the resignations of crypto-friendly finance minister Rishi Sunak and senior Treasury official Jon Glen, threatened to shake up the plans.  In May, the collapse of $18 billion stablecoin terraUSD prompted the Bank of England, the U.K.’s central bank, to publish a consultation on its plans to regulate similar crypto assets and to propose the bank be given the power to appoint administrators to oversee insolvency procedures for failed stablecoin issuers.  Earlier this month, Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe hinted at a delay on crypto regulations in light of the cabinet reshuffle, but promised stablecoin rules before the August summer break.  Explaining the new bill during his first speech as the newly appointed finance minister on Tuesday, Nadhim Zahawi said the framework “reinforces the U.K.’s position as a leading center for technology as we safely adopt crypto assets.”  Read more: UK Crypto Industry Hopes for More Clarity From Planned Stablecoin Rules",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/20/uk-regulators-to-introduce-rules-for-stablecoins-in-new-markets-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/864f896c5efb7bf99689b81a449e3c5a87b67bcb-4603x3452.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meme coins are now getting more attention as the major crypto continue to pick up and soar. Dogecoin (DOGE) is seen to be moderately volatile trading along the range of $0.0655 to $0.06867 overnight. The crypto space is blinking green as Bitcoin ushers with a gain of 0.82 percent, Ethereum spikes at over 4%, and Solana joins the party as the biggest gainers with 10%. DOGE trading volume has spiked by 21.22 percent or a total of $528.5 million. The coin now ranks in the 10th place with a total market cap of $9 billion. DOGE has failed to break higher for the past couple of hours which is indicative of further retracement or retesting. Suggested Reading | Solana Adds 70% More Shine – Can SOL Keep The Light Coming? Dogecoin Reaches $0.069 Resistance Level On the brighter side, Dogecoin is seen to move forward from a previous low of $0.058 to hit the $0.069 major resistance level. With that in mind, the losses that have been incurred in the early days of July has already been retraced and a reversal is set to happen anytime soon. Can DOGE now easily breach past the $0.070 to $0.075? But, for now, there is no lower low set, so rallying may be expected once a new higher local low is set. As of now, the Dogecoin price may have difficulty to break higher than the $0.069 mark because it still offers a forceful resistance. On the other hand, DOGE/USD may slide down below $0.065 which is seen as the closest support where the next probable higher low can be set over the next couple of days. DOGE total market cap at $9.83 billion on the daily chart | Source: TradingView.com Once that retest is done, another attempt to rally above $0.069 is expected – and perhaps cruise past the $0.070 barrier. Now, if DOGE happens to drop below the resistance mark of $0.0625, further downside may be reached in the next few days. DOGE/USD is seen to have a bearish movement today due to the slight retrace that shifted into a consolidation. With that in mind, Dogecoin will not likely go higher and will have a tendency to retrace further at the end of the week. DOGE May Easily Breach $0.075 Meanwhile, Dogecoin transactions surged with over 70,000 numbers changing hands in the last 24 hours. The sudden spike in transactions may be the result of whales staking more DOGE. More so, the increased DOGE transactions can also be indicative of a massive selling pressure as whales may strategically move their funds from cold wallets to crypto exchange addresses. Dogecoin has consistently been doing great. As of this writing, DOGE is currently trading at $0.074, up 25% in the last seven days.

The gain came as ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, surged to $1,500 earlier this week ahead of the Ethereum blockchain's expected “Merge” in September.  Dogecoin’s DOGE rose 11%, leading gains among major cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours. No technical catalysts for the move seemed to exist, but developers for the network polled community members for their opinions on a Dogecoin-centric hackathon event in November, which may suggest future technical development.  Prices of Cardano’s ADA and XRP rose as much as 8%. BNB added 2.7%, while Solana’s SOL traded flat after a nearly 30% rally over the past week. Total crypto market capitalization increased 4% to above $1.1 trillion.  Outside of major cryptocurrencies, ApeCoin’s APE jumped 8% as buying momentum from last week’s metaverse game demo continued. Shiba Inu’s SHIB rose 10% despite the lack of a technical catalyst.  Market commentators said bitcoin gains came amid a recovery in broader equity markets as traders assess the upcoming round of U.S. rate hikes. Odds show a 65% chance of a 75-basis point hike.  “Bitcoin on Tuesday posted its highest gains in a month on the back of a rebound in U.S. stock indices and a weaker dollar,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email.  “Bitcoin has tested the highs since June 13 near $23,700, and on Wednesday, it is trying to consolidate above its 50-day moving average,” Kuptsikevich said. Consolidation above the 50-day moving average is seen as a sign of a positive shift in the momentum among chart-based or price action traders.  However, Kuptsikevich added: “If the upside momentum stalls, as it did in February and March this year, we should be prepared for a sharp increase in selling.”  Other analysts showed similar sentiments and cautioned against a bullish mood.  “With the rules of the future games of mining, staking and trading still pretty murky, and the value of crypto assets hugely sensitive to volatile conditions in financial markets, it’s clear investing in the crypto Wild West is still a very risky business,” Susannah Streeter, senior markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in an email.  “Investors should only dabble at the fringes of their investments with money they have to be prepared to lose,” Streeter added.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/20/dogecoin-bitcoin-lead-recovery-among-majors-but-some-analysts-warn-of-selling-pressure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42e9dd7f5ba5a9d2fa1240ee35dac638bf27f52d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

S&P Risk Controlled Crypto Index ETPs According to an official press release, 21Shares has listed its S&P Risk Controlled Bitcoin and Ethereum Index ETPs on the Swiss SIX Exchange today. It trades under the ticker symbol SPBTC and SPETH. The ETPs will track the S&P Bitcoin Dynamic Rebalancing Risk Control 40% index and the S&P Ethereum Dynamic Rebalancing Risk Control 40% index. Both the indexes aim to soften the volatility of Bitcoin and Ethereum through a rebalancing process that allocates more assets to the US dollar during periods of rising volatility by replicating the strategy of the benchmarks of S&P Dow Jones Indices (SPDJI). Commenting on the development, Arthur Krause, Director of ETP Product at 21Shares, said: “These newest ETPs based on S&P Dow Jones Indices world-class indices allow investors to realize the benefits of these innovative crypto exposures while controlling for volatility. These ETPs are the next step in our Crypto Winter Suite, providing investors with entry to the asset class in a risk-controlled manner.” The announcement comes following the launch of 21Shares’ Bitcoin Core ETP, designed to offer low-cost exposure to Bitcoin as the lowest-cost physically-backed Bitcoin ETP in the world.

The newspaper conducted ""extensive interviews"" with industry executives, lawyers and financial regulators who ""sounded the alarm over a spiraling regulatory crisis in Japan’s multibillion-dollar virtual asset business.""  The Financial Services Agency, the country's financial watchdog, has ""repeatedly criticized"" the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), an advocacy group set up in 2018 to promote self-regulation in the crypto industry, the report said.  Meeting minutes obtained by the Financial Times showed that the JVCEA received an “extremely stern warning” from the FSA in two meetings last year. The regulator was concerned about delays in anti-money-laundering regulation and that it wasn't privy to deliberations and decision-making processes of the association, according to the report.  The minutes also showed the FSA saw a lack of communication between JVCEA leadership and members, resulting in ""poor management."" The association is made up of about 40 digital asset firms representing the industry.  According to the report, the secretariat of the JVCEA formed a union for protection in what the report calls ""a stunning act of defiance for Japan.""  JVCEA board member Masao Yanaga told the newspaper that the JVCEA lacked resources and that AML regulations were hard to implement because of a lack of international agreements on sharing data.  The JVCEA also said it was making improvements in response to the regulator's concerns.  Regulators around the world are scrambling to ensure sturdy rules are in place after the recent market downturn saw a number of high-profile crypto companies collapse and $2 trillion wiped out of crypto markets in a matter of weeks.

Key Technical Points: The FLOW prices have appreciated 31% since last week. The 20-and-50-day EMA could soon provide a bullish crossover. The 24-hour trading volume of Flow is $169.4 million, indicating a rise of 81.5%. Past Performance of FLOW Following a drastic fall in April-May, the FLOW/USDT pair showcased a slow yet steady downward approach under the influence of a descending trendline. The multiple retests to this level indicated the sellers were aggressively selling on rallies, which plunged the altcoin to a low of $1.17. However, amid the improving market sentiment, the coin price breached this resistance trendline on July 16th. Source – Tradingview FLOW Technical Analysis A bullish breakout from the downsloping trendline indicates a shift in market participants’ sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The post-retest rally showcased three consecutive green candles and soared the altcoin by 27%. Moreover, this run-up breached an in-between resistance of $1.8, offering a higher footing for buyers to continue this rally. The FLOW price has pierced the 20-and-50-day SMA slope with the recent price jump, offering early signs of recovery. Furthermore, these lines may flip to a viable support level and bolster the current recovery. Additionally, the expanding gap between the fast and slow slopes of the MACD indicator accentuates aggressive buying in the market. Moreover, these lines nearing a crossover above the equilibrium provide additional confirmation for buyers. In short, FLOW technical analysis displays a positive outlook with a pullback opportunity to buy this at a discounted price. Upcoming Trend Today, the FLOW price is up 2% but shows a long-wick rejection in the daily candle, reflecting the profit booking from the short-term traders. Anyhow, a minor retracement is needed to stabilize the sudden price jump. The expected pullback could retest the $1.8 before continuing the prevailing recovery. If the coin buyers sustain above the $1.8 resistance, the potential rally should first target $2.32, projecting a 17.35% gain.

146423,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496230,1658310917,Ethereum Merge: How ETHBTC Could Hint At A Return Of Risk Appetite,"The merge is near, so it’s Ethereum time to shine. The eternal second most popular cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been outperforming bitcoin for the last few days. Is the reason the return of the market’s appetite for risk? Or is it just the fact that Ethereum’s developers announced a specific date for the mythical merge? Let’s examine the numbers, the facts, and the experts’ opinions to figure out exactly what’s going on. In The Weekly Update, Arcane Research’s newsletter, they point out that the ETHBTC pair surged “ from 0.053 on July 12th to 0.7 on July 19th.” It’s at “levels not seen since mid-May,” but why? According to Arcane, it “might be related to increased risk appetite in the market, evident by sharp altcoin recoveries across the board.” They identify another factor, “Celsius repaid its DeFi loans. This contributed to reducing the downward gravitational pull enforced by potential liquidations and contagion-related uncertainty.” And then, of course, there’s the merge. What Do The Experts Say About The Merge? The facts are the facts, Ethereum is on a roll. In a previous report, NewsBTC analyzed the state of the market: “Ethereum has now broken above an important technical point. After trending below the 50-day moving average for the better part of last month, ETH has flipped this technical level and is now sitting comfortably above it. The implication of this has been a complete 180-degree turn from bearish to bullish, especially during the short term.” As for the probable cause, Arcane Research already named two. The main one, though, is the possibility of the merge. Back to The Weekly Update: “On Thursday, July 14th, the Ethereum Foundation member Tim Beiko suggested Sept 19th as the tentative launch date for the merge. This might have benefited ETH, leading to last week’s surge. Following the announcement, Lido’s staked ETH token has neared ETH parity.” In another NewsBTC report, we quoted another expert trying to make sense of the situation. According to Youwei Yang, director of financial analytics at StoneX, the causes for the recent surge are: “The first is the recently announced time for the Ethereum “merge” update, which should make the network significantly more energy-efficient. Yang claims that the “calming” of macroeconomic anxieties is the second.” ETHBTC price chart on Coinbase | Source: ETHBTC by The Weekly Update Is Ethereum’s Merge a “Buy The Rumor” Event? The change from Proof-Of-Work to the Proof-Of-Stake consensus mechanism does use less energy, but brings its own set of problems with it. Discussing those is beyond the scope of this article. The important part of the equation for Ethereum holders is that the merge will finally bring native staking to the blockchain. The thousands of ETH already locked into the Beacon Chain will finally produce real results, and a new kind of user, the validators will rise. Is this enough to justify the price surge? Absolutely. Is it guaranteed that the merge will happen on September 19th? Probably not, considering Ethereum has postponed its difficulty bomb five times already. ETH price chart for 07/20/2022 on Bitfinex | Source: ETH/USD on TradingView.com Is The Contagion Event That Sent Everything To Red Over? According to Arcane, “contagion seems to be resolving now, with prices stabilizing. This recovery may be viewed as a healthy confirmation of the market normalizing as market stress settles down.” Their interpretation of the situation might be overly optimistic, though. A pseudonymous Twitter user that identifies himself as “a trader/defi analyst at a major crypto fund and use Nansen almost daily,” thinks more pain is on the way with or without the merge. 4/ There are dozens of wallets just like these that 3AC still has with thousands of ETH. It’s very likely that all of these wallets are going to be liquidated in order to pay back creditors. Check out the number of funds that have been moved around from just one wallet alone. pic.twitter.com/75HkR097zV — jbjbjb (@bryptobricks) July 19, 2022 The Three Arrows Capital trial is still unfolding, and “3AC still has with thousands of ETH. It’s very likely that all of these wallets are going to be liquidated in order to pay back creditors.” If that happens, it’s “going to cause a harsh sell-off across the broader crypto ecosystem, setting up the next catalyst down.” Sorry to rain on Ethereum’s parade, but those are the facts. Good luck with the merge, though.

Figures for “New Daily Addresses” on Solana consistently grew its user base throughout the bear market, research by CoinMarketCap citing data from Glassnode and The Block showed.  New Daily Addresses refer to first-time wallet users on any blockchain network, which can signal growth and adoption. On Solana, new users peaked at over 400,000 in May before gradually declining to 240,000 users this week. These figures are a jump from December 2021’s levels of 150,000 to 170,000 new users each day.  Daily active wallets have similarly climbed this year, with over 32 million active users in June and 37 million in May. This rose from an average of 20 million active users in the first four months of 2022.  However, data suggests the activity did not amount to inflows. Total value locked (TVL) on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications running on Solana dropped to $2.9 billion this week from May’s $6 billion figure. Solana TVL peaked at $14 billion in December 2021.  Solana’s native SOL tokens have grown amid rising wallet usage.

144854,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=243466,1658307919,ADA Technical Analysis: Can Cardano Restore Dominance Above $0.50?,"The ADA price action shows a long-coming resistance trendline breakout rally prepared to overcome the 100-day average line. Key Technical Points: The ADA prices jumped by 11.28% in the last 24 hours. The post-retest rally accounts for a price jump of 30% last week. The 24-hour trading volume of Cardano is $1.66 Billion, indicating a rise of 9.10%. Past Performance of ADA The ADA prices break above the long-coming downtrend under the resistance trendline influence on 7th July with a 3.5% jump. However, the 50-day SMA providing opposition influenced a retest of the broken trendline. The price action shows a post-retest reversal on 13th July from the $0.40 mark accounting for a jump of 30% over the week. Source – Tradingview ADA Technical Analysis The breakout rally helps the ADA market price exceed the $0.50 psychological level resulting in the bullish breakout of the 50-day SMA. Moreover, the price growing above the 50-day SMA teases a jump to the 100-day SMA. Additionally, the intraday trading volume grows to support the breakout rally. The RSI indicator displays a sharp spike in the uptrend from below the halfway line to approach the overbought boundary within days. Therefore, the indicator shows a phenomenal increase in underlying bullishness over the days. Furthermore, the MACD indicator displays the fast and slow lines surpassing the zero line while reclaiming the positive alignment, undermining the bearish attempt. Additionally, the growing bullish spread in the positive territory indicates that the uptrend will continue. Thus, momentum indicators maintain an encouraging viewpoint for the future. In a nutshell, the ADA technical analysis shows a high likelihood of an uptrend continuing above the $0.50 mark. Upcoming Trend The bullish trend above $0.50 will most likely drive the ADA prices to the 100-day SMA at $0.61. Moreover, the increased chances of a bullish breakout will potentially fuel the uptrend to $0.75.

OneFootball also acquired the rights to create NFTs out of iconic historical moments from Serie A’s archive. The NFTs will be built on Flow blockchain using Dapper Lab’s secure wallet and launched on OneFootball’s marketplace, Aera. The first product will be revealed on August 1, with the first drop scheduled for August 29. Commenting on the development, the CEO and founder of OneFootball, Lucas von Cranach, said: “We’re creating an accessible experience for fans of Serie A. Our core business is Web2. We, as OneFootball, focus on centralized experiences. But I’m a true believer in Web3, because it opens up possibilities to decentralize these experiences and to be in the position to own content,” The biggest competitor of OneFootball is Sorare, one of the largest NFT platforms for soccer.

Source – Tradingview VET Technical Analysis VET price action shows an uptrend continuation above the $0.026 mark with an increase in buying pressure. Moreover, the price sustaining above the 50-day SMA teases a jump to the 100-day SMA.

142861,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496226,1658303889,An Interview with Ben Caselin on AAX- Lightning Network Integration and TARO Protocol Implementation,"One of the leading crypto platforms, AAX has been making waves with lots of new developments. Recently, the platform announced its integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which was soon followed by another update regarding its support for TARO — a protocol that enables asset issuance on the Bitcoin network. To satisfy our curiosity, we decided to throw a few questions at Ben Caselin, the head of research and strategy at AAX for some insights. And, here’s how our short interview went. Q: We have been hearing about many developments happening at AAX, with the latest one being the integration of Lightning Network. Before we dig deeper, can you please tell our readers more about AAX? A: AAX launched in November 2019 with a keen focus on institutional standards. It is currently among the most prominent exchanges in the Asia-Pacific region and is quickly expanding into other continents. Our platform is powered by LSEG Technology – the same technology that powers London Stock Exchange, Borsa Italiana, and Oslo Stock Exchange. We at AAX are deeply committed to accelerating the adoption of Bitcoin and digital assets. As of now, our platform can process most orders in under 800 microseconds, paired with a myriad of crypto and DeFi-centric products. In 2022, we are focusing on expanding our work in key emerging markets such as Brazil, Nigeria and Turkey to provide everyone with access to the benefits of crypto. Q: How is AAX different from other crypto exchange platforms? A: For instance, AAX offers the lowest fees on the market and above-market yields across savings. We are known for our prompt customer service, which we offer 24×7 across multiple languages. On top of it, AAX is the first exchange to switch to the Satoshi standard. Following this, we also launched the first SATS spot market with zero trading fees. Q: Tell us more about Lightning Network integration and how it is expected to help the users. A: Lightning Network is a second-layer solution on top of Bitcoin that is experiencing accelerating adoption, especially in emerging markets. This is mainly because transacting in bitcoin on the Lightning Network is almost without cost, and settlement is near-instant. To that extent, adding support for Lightning opens up a new on-ramp for those holding bitcoin in a Lightning app to make deposits in AAX. This, in turn, makes withdrawals cheaper while facilitating smaller transactions (something that works in line with our SATS spot market). By integrating the Lightning Network, AAX aims to enable small traders/holders to enjoy the benefits of lower fees and minimum limits. Additionally, this integration allows for arbitrage between other Lightning-integrated exchanges by plugging AAX into a rapidly growing bitcoin payment network that the likes of Twitter are also integrating. The result will help AAX lower barriers to participation, thus accelerating crypto adoption. Q: What are the changes you expect to see in the user behavior and experience on AAX following the Lightning Network integration? A: Many bitcoin-focused community members look for exchanges supporting the fast and cheap funding method. We expect to experience easier onboarding in Latin America, where the Lightning Network is seeing rapid uptake. Additionally, the integration also opens up the door to more partnerships for liquidity provision and potential innovation around Lightning-based yield products. Q: Is there a migration process or some sort of action the users have to take from their end to benefit from Lightning Network? A: Lightning Withdrawals will only be helpful for users who have a Lightning app or if they are withdrawing to another exchange that supports Lightning Network. Users could also pay Lightning invoices with their bitcoin funds on AAX. Q: Do you think people will be interested in using BTC on the Lightning Network during this period of market uncertainty? A: Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and as a means for day-to-day payments, it’s probably too volatile for many people. But there are multiple teams working on bringing additional capabilities to this technology. One that we’re excited about is TARO, a project that wants to add generalized smart contracts and tokens to Bitcoin, using the same basic technology as the Lightning Network. Its biggest selling point is of course the ability to transact in stablecoins: cheap fees, and instant settlement of Lightning, but without the price volatility of BTC. Q: What are some of the opportunities with TARO and how is this protocol different from other alternative first and second-layer chains like say Solana, Polygon, or Ethereum? A: In Taro, smart contracts and asset transfers are not executed by the blockchain, and they are also not enforced by the blockchain. Instead, transfers are executed by the sender of an asset (who has to make a corresponding bitcoin transaction), and enforced by the recipient, same as the Lightning Network. The Bitcoin network of course holds the “checkpoint” data to make sure that if somebody cheats, the transaction sequence can be reverted to the last shared point. Q: When will AAX integrate TARO as well? A: It’s still too early to say as the project is in testnet, and the TARO team right now is not committing to any mainnet launch dates. Development is clearly well underway, and we could expect to see the project live quite soon. AAX will of course integrate it as quickly as possible once it’s live and has seen some real-world testing. Q: Can you tell us more about the Satoshi (SATs) Standard and the reason behind adopting it? A: There is a price unit bias that gives newcomers to the space the impression that Bitcoin is expensive while meme coins are cheap. This is a misconception – adopting a SATS standard counters the price unit bias. For instance, the smallest bitcoin unit of measurement is a Satoshi (SATS) with a value of 1 SATS equivalent to 0.00000001 BTC. Not only is SATS the answer to the users’ perceived problems of bitcoin unaffordability and inaccessibility, but it also is expressive of a long-term vision and bullish expectation around the long-term growth of bitcoin. There are only 21 million bitcoins that can ever exist, and since there are more than 7 billion people, it is expected that over time, SATS will be adopted as the more practical denomination. Q: Will there be any confusion among new users on the platform who are used to BTC denomination while using the SATs standard? A: Whenever a new concept is introduced, people need time to get acquainted with it – that’s basic human nature. That said, SATS is well-known in the crypto space, and as people “stack SATS” and participate in the conversation, it’s pretty easy to switch between denominations. If people can understand cents, they can get SATS. In fact, SATS are easier to understand and calculate and will play a crucial role in facilitating micropayments and transaction fees on AAX. Q: What are the other developments in store for AAX? A: We significantly increased retail trading volume in 2021 as we onboarded thousands of new users. In 2022 and beyond, we want to keep the momentum going as we expand our user base across emerging markets. This year AAX is focused on more product localization efforts to match the benefits of crypto with the specific needs of communities. We will also focus more on crypto projects designed to drive impact, especially around important humanitarian goals – this is how we intend to build community, advocate for the space, and work to make crypto a force of good.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/interview/an-interview-with-ben-caselin-on-aax-lightning-network-integration-and-taro-protocol-implementation/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

If approved, XRP holders may no longer be able to contribute to Ripple’s legal battle with the regulatory agency. Ripple-SEC Case Gets New Drama On Wednesday, defense attorney James Filan shared an SEC motion requesting the courts to revoke the Amici status granted to XRP holders. “The SEC, in a heavily redacted letter alleging threats against an expert, asks Judge Torres to revoke amici status granted to XRP Holders and to bar John Deaton from any further participation in the case,” Filian wrote in its tweet. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP BREAKING: The SEC, in a heavily redacted letter alleging threats against an expert, asks Judge Torres to revoke amici status granted to XRP Holders and to bar @JohnEDeaton1 from any further participation in the case.https://t.co/a3xVJyCs99 — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 106k (beware of imposters) (@FilanLaw) July 19, 2022 Led by attorney John Deaton, a group of XRP holders filed a motion to intervene in the case in March 2021. Although the court rejected their attempt to insert themselves into the case last October, they did manage to obtain amici status. XRP holders thus were able to file “friends of the court” briefs. In May, Deaton asked the court to file an amicus brief regarding the opinions of Patrick B. Doody, the SEC expert who testified to the court on what XRP holders considered when buying the token. However, the SEC believes that the movants’ proposed brief would simply “duplicate” the defendants’ efforts. At the time of writing, the XRP is trading at $0.38, up 7.1% in the last 24 hours and 21.6% in the past seven days.

141969,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=243442,1658302479,STX Technical Analysis: Can Recovery Rally Exit The Range?,"The STX price action shows a bull cycle within a consolidation range, teasing a breakout rally above the $0.45 mark. Is this a FOMO trap for buyers? Key Technical Points: The STX prices jumped by 10.35% in the last 24 hours. The bull cycle within the consolidation breaches the 50-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Stacks is $38.30 Million, indicating a rise of 94%. Past Performance of STX The STX price action has been trapped within a consolidation range between 0.35 dollars in 0.5 dollars in the daily chart. However, the recent bull cycle within the consolidation range exceeds the 50-day SMA and the consolidation range. The bull run accounts for a 35% jump in the last week and teases an uptrend continuation to the 100-day SMA. Source – Tradingview STX Technical Analysis STX price chart shows an increase in bullish commitment as the intraday trading volume spikes over the week, supporting the uptrend. Hence, traders can expect the bull cycle to exceed the $0.50 psychological mark and reach the overhead resistance close to the 100-day SMA. The RSI indicator shows an increase in the underlying bullishness as the RSI slope reverses from the nearly oversold territory to exceed the halfway line. Hence, the technical indicator adds points to the bullet trend continuation theory. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows fast and slow lines reclaiming the bullish alignment after the shot mojo below the zero line. Hence, the technical indicator displays an increase in buying pressure as the bullish histograms resurface. In short, STX technical analysis displays a high likelihood of a price jump of 40% to reach the 100-day SMA. Upcoming Trend The increasing likelihood of an upcoming bullish trend in the STX price upon the consolidation breakout increases the fear of missing out (FOMO) among the traders. However, smart traders must wait for the price action confirmation to avoid any trap. Conversely, a bullish failure to sustain above the $0.45 resistance level will lead to a retracement of $0.35.

U.S Govt Recovers $500,000 from North Korean Hackers According to an official statement, the U.S. Department of Justice seized roughly $500,000 in ransom payments that a medical center in Kansas paid to North Korean hackers last year, along with cryptocurrency used to launder the payments, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Tuesday. While the hospital quickly paid the attackers, they also notified the FBI, “which was the right thing to do for both themselves and for future victims,” Monaco said. The notification enabled the FBI to trace the payment using blockchain analytics, using the same techniques that had been deployed after the attack targeting the U.S. Colonial Pipeline. “Thanks to rapid reporting and cooperation from a victim, the FBI, and Justice Department prosecutors have disrupted the activities of a North Korean state-sponsored group deploying ransomware known as ‘Maui.’ Not only did this allow us to recover their ransom payment as well as a ransom paid by previously unknown victims, but we were also able to identify a previously unidentified ransomware strain.” North Korea has been accused of orchestrating a number of ransomware attacks against medical facilities. It is believed that the cryptocurrencies raised are subsequently used to fund the state’s nuclear weapons program. Pyongyang has also been linked to a number of social engineering incidents targeting companies within the crypto space, including the record-breaking Ronin hack back in March.

Twitter Wins First Legal Battle with Elon Musk A judge in Delaware Chancery Court ordered a five-day trial in October. Twitter had asked for an expedited trial in September, while Musk called for waiting until February 2023 because of the complexity of the case. However, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, the head judge of Delaware’s court of chancery, stated that the case should be resolved quickly, agreeing with Twitter’s claim that it could be harmed by uncertainty about its future as a public company. “Delay threatens irreparable harm. The longer the delay, the greater the risk.” McCormick added that the court was able to “quickly process complex litigation,” “Those concerns are on full display in the present case. Typically, the longer the merger transaction remains in limbo, the larger the cloud of uncertainty cast over the company and the greater the risk of irreparable harm to the sellers.” Musk was supposed to pay $54.20 a share for Twitter but informed the company in July that he wanted to back out of the agreement. “It’s attempted sabotage. He’s doing his best to run Twitter down,” said attorney William Savitt, representing Twitter before McCormick on Tuesday. Musk said he was terminating the deal as, according to him, the social media company had breached the agreement by failing to provide enough information on spam accounts and had misrepresented the number of spam accounts in its disclosures to the US SEC. He also believes that the social media company breached the agreement by failing to consult with him when firing senior employees recently.

Will the uptrend drive SNX prices above $3.5? Key Technical Points: The SNX prices jumped by 9.41% in the last 24 hours. The market value trades between the 50 and 100-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Synthetix is $91.9 Million, indicating a drop of 25%. Past Performance of SNX As mentioned in our previous article, the SNX prices sustain above the 50-day SMA and maintain the breakout rally momentum. The rally heads higher to the 100-day SMA and shows a growth of 35% over the last week. Additionally, the intraday trading volume showcases a positive trend supporting the bullish uprising. Source – Tradingview SNX Technical Analysis SNX price action shows a higher price rejection from the 100-day SMA, reflecting the difficulty for the price trend to surpass the resistance. Hence the uptrend must exceed the opposing SMA to reach the overhead resistance of $3.5. The RSI indicator shows a gradual uptrend reversing from the nearly oversold territory exceeding the Halfway line and the 14 days average line. Hence, the technical indicator supports the thesis of uptrend continuation. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows fast and slow lines maintaining a positive trend above the zero line while the bullish histograms resurface. Further, the increasing spread between the fast and slow lines hints that the uptrend is here to stay. Hence the technical indicators maintain a bullish point of view for the upcoming trend. In short, SNX technical analysis displays positive support for the ongoing uptrend and increases the likelihood of the prices reaching the $3.5 mark. Upcoming Trend The upcoming trend in the SNX prices emits a bullish vibe projecting a high likelihood of the obtained surpassing the $3.5 resistance level to reach the $4 mark. In contrast, the bullish failure to exceed the 100-day average line will result in downfall to the bottom support at the $2.5 mark.

Revsin served as head of investments at Republic Capital, a registered investment advisor with over $900 million in assets under management. He led the firm’s investments in crypto companies Flipside Crypto, Robinhood (HOOD), Avalanche, Polygon and Dapper Labs, among others.  “There's sort of two things that I had been looking for. The first was to get a little closer to the companies building in the action, especially in the bear market. And I think that the incubator … helps illustrate a little bit of what we'll be able to do at Tribe,” Revsin told CoinDesk in an interview, explaining his decision to leave Republic Capital after four years.  The other factor was Tribe’s status as a larger brand with multi-asset funds across both equity and crypto markets and a multi-stage investment strategy, said Revsin.  Crypto represents about 30% of Tribe Capital’s overall assets, according to the firm. Portfolio companies include cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken and FTX, Ethereum blockchain technology company ConsenSys and CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.  Revsin’s role at Tribe Capital will include investing out of the $400 million equity fund Venture Fund 3, expanding the crypto franchise with the existing team, and overseeing the new incubator program  Tribe debuted the Tribe Crypto Labs incubator earlier Wednesday, which was first reported by TechCrunch. The $25 million startup initiative will help the firm collaborate with crypto developers and accelerate early-stage investments across the Cosmos ecosystem and layer 1 blockchains such as Solana and Avalanche.  Venture capital investments were down in the first half of the year due to the global bear market, which has hit the crypto industry and investments particularly hard.  Revsin acknowledged that bear markets, from an investment perspective, offer better multiples and fundamental value. On the crypto front, Revsin noted that the industry has been through bear markets before, though the cycles are getting larger as crypto companies grow larger.  “I think crypto has a lot of introspection to do. The self-regulatory dream has not panned out to the level it should have,” said Revsin. “Regulators are going to come in and do some good work and probably some questionable work and then hopefully it all shakes out.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/20/tribe-capital-hires-republic-capital-co-founder-revsin-as-managing-partner,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4009c9febf8ba97801fa180d0f659b907ca40857-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Is the Upcoming Merge A Catalyst?,"The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum, has soared 45 percent during the past week, outperforming the majority of other betable assets. There could be a simple explanation for this: As Ethereum’s team of developers approaches the conclusion of a multiyear, extremely difficult upgrade, traders are shifting positive. Ethereum Surge The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum, has surged by about 45% over the past week, outperforming the majority of the top 100 crypto assets. While there are many theories surrounding ETH’s bullish trend, one of the main drivers of price movements is the impending Ethereum merger. Trading in ETH has changed from bearish to bullish as developers get closer to finishing a multi-year, extremely difficult upgrade. The entire ETH supply in profit has now risen to 56% with the intense social expectation of the Merge, from lows of 41% just prior to the current price spike. ETH/USD trades in new bullish momentum. According to statistics from Glassnode, a significant clearing out of short positions in the futures market was the reason for Ethereum’s 22 percent gain this week. Glassnode tweeted: “Over $98M in short futures positions were liquidated in one hour, pushing $ETH prices up by 12.5%.” The Number of ETH Addresses in Loss (7d MA) reached a 1-month low of 39,112,029 at press time, further demonstrating ETH’s recent bullish trend. Source: Glassnode Since the last actions that will really transfer Ethereum activity to the Beacon Chain are scheduled for September, there is still plenty of time for The Merge. Superphiz.eth, an Ethereum educator, added in a Tweet that Goerli would undergo the merging transfer as the last public testnet around August 11. The mainnet merge is anticipated to float during the week of September 19 if everything with Goerli goes according to plan. Related Reading | Ethereum Classic (ETC) Reclaims $3 Billion Market Cap, More Upside To Follow? Experts Opinion Youwei Yang, director of financial analytics at StoneX, says that two “certainties” are the cause of this upward rise for EthereumThe first is the recently announced time for the Ethereum “merge” update, which should make the network significantly more energy-efficient. Yang claims that the “calming” of macroeconomic anxieties is the second. “Actually if you see the price movement tick by tick, this time it’s more like ETH leading BTC [or Bitcoin] instead of the other way around in usual times, so it’s a strong indication of ETH-led bear market rally with the confirmation and sentiment of ETH2.0,” said Yang, referring to post-merge Ethereum. In his most recent episode of “The Breakdown,” famous podcaster and devoted industry watcher Nathaniel Whittemore made this assertion. There is a growing understanding that “the Merge” might influence markets on Twitter, Discord, and everywhere else people debate cryptocurrencies. After months of low prices, the event suggests, as Whittemore put it, a “return of optimism” in the cryptocurrency markets. The Merge also fills a “narrative void,” allowing crypto enthusiasts to tell others stories about how this technology is changing the world. Others believe that the Merge could be causing ETH price to spike due to structural reasons. The upgrade represents a fundamental change in the potential applications of Ethereum by rewarding investors who stake their assets in the network. Even Bitcoin-like deflationary forces that further benefit holders could result from the move. People who are purchasing ETH now in preparation may view it more as an investment than a transaction in this scenario.

Over the last week, ADA surged by almost 20%. The altcoin has been moving up in an ascending trendline over the last 24 hours. Currently, the altcoin has steadied on the $0.47 support line. Now Cardano has finally managed to claim its old resistance level and the bulls are back. For the bullish momentum to get intensified ADA needs to stay above the resistance mark it crossed above. It is however to soon to say if ADA is on a bullish momentum or if this is a relief rally. Bitcoin’s upward movement and moving above the $22,000 level has pushed other altcoins on a bullish price action. Buyers have returned to the market and strengthened the bulls. Broader market sentiments can again drag ADA to its immediate support level. The global cryptocurrency market cap today is $1.11 Trillion, a 5.4% change in the last 24 hours. Cardano Price Analysis: Four Hour Chart ADA was trading at $0.506 at the time of writing. The coin broke past the $0.50 price mark which it struggled to move past over the last few weeks. Overhead resistance for the coin was at $0.53 but a slight lose in the momentum could drag it down to $0.47. For the bears to remain subdued, Cardano has to remain above the $0.50 level for the next trading sessions. Buying strength also has to remain high for ADA to continue sailing north. Amount of Cardano traded remained high suggesting increased buying strength on the chart. Technical Analysis ADA displayed buying strength on the four hour chart. Buyers are in control and that could make Cardano rally further. In accordance with the same, the Relative Strength Index was above the 60-point indicating that buyers outnumbered sellers on the chart. Price of ADA was above the 20-SMA which is also indication that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. Cardano was also above the 50-SMA and 200-SMA line which pointed towards bullishness.

The Directional Movement Index determines which way the coin is headed. DMI was positive as the +DI was above the -DI line. The Average Directional Index (Red) was nearing 40 and that means that the present trend is growing stronger.
