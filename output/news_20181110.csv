42402147,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ZmQ,1541852442,Sexual Assault Survivor Uses Crypto to Crowdfund Anonymously,"A new use case is emerging for cryptocurrency: helping women who've suffered sexual harassment or assault gain financial independence while also protecting their privacy.  Case in point, a sexual assault survivor used the crypto-powered payment processor Seeds to crowdfund $500 in September after the trauma left her unable to work for several months.  Had she used a traditional crowdfunding site like Kickstarter or GoFundMe, the survivor would have had to provide a government-issued ID and bank account, which someone working at the platform might have connected with her story.  Instead, using the Seeds ethereum-based token allowed this first-time crypto user to raise the money without revealing her identity to anyone directly involved other than the platform's CEO, Rachel Cook.  The survivor received the token – which cost less than a quarter –as a gift from Cook in order to post a ""Request for Help"" through 30 apps that use Seeds' free front-end tools, such as Aura, an app for meditation. Users then donated through the in-app pop-up with their credit cards.  Usually, that money is split between app developers, Seeds' 10 percent cut, and the end-recipient who filed the request.  But in this case, Cook waived all fees once the tokenized request was fulfilled. Cook said it only took three weeks to raise the funds, the fastest fulfillment since the token was first launched in October 2017.  ""I met this woman in person, by coincidence, and we started talking about #MeToo movement,"" Cook said, adding that people who experience sexual harassment or assault at work are often afraid to speak up or leave because they can't afford to lose that job.  ""Survivors have trouble giving themselves permission to ask for money,"" Cook said. ""The next logical extension I saw in that [#metoo] was we need to talk about how this economic [crypto] system can meet this need.""  Cook, an assault survivor herself, said she aims to make these anonymous requests more accessible for crypto newbies who need help with legal and mental health costs.  She told CoinDesk:  ""We have to let people know that this is available and that people can use it without feeling uncomfortable...We want to fill that gap.""  Ticket to safety  The crowdfunding story is just one example of how women in the cryptocurrency community are quietly helping each other learn to use different tools to overcome personal trauma.  In one famous case in Afghanistan, at least one abuse survivor worked with bitcoin advocate Roya Mahboob years ago to discreetly earn bitcoin in order to pay for a divorce.  More recently, a North American cam model told CoinDesk that she's saving crypto to try and get away from an ""unhappy"" living situation that is detrimental to her mental health. Since she alone controls the private keys, she doesn't need to worry about external evidence, like bank statements, unexpectedly arriving in the mail.  ""Crypto has definitely provided me with tools to overcome obstacles,"" the erotic performer told CoinDesk. ""I want women to feel like crypto can help empower them because of the accessibility of it.""  Another domestic abuse survivor and blockchain developer is working on a suite of money management decentralized applications (dapps), for such users.  ""Being financially stable was the key reason why I was able to leave [the abusive husband],"" the developer (who, like the model, spoke on condition of anonymity) told CoinDesk. ""Survivors, like other disadvantaged folks, lack wealth-building vehicles.""  Speaking to how the vast majority of intimate partner violence involves some form of financial abuse, where the abuser controls the victim's access to economic resources, the developer added:  ""The main reason why women stay in abusive relationships is because they are dependent upon their partners.""  Learning curve  Unlike the developer and model, both of whom often work with bitcoin, the survivor who used a Seeds token later redeemed the token for fiat via the startup's web portal. Although the survivor received the funds with PayPal (which would have to know her identity), there was no public information connecting her to the Seeds campaign.  In the future, any survivor who wants help cashing out fiat without offering any personal information to third parties could simply ask Cook for alternatives, she said.  Plus, others can acquire Seeds tokens without a verified ID by using a decentralized exchange platform like AirSwap or 0x.

42402155,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ZuI,1541851244,Crypto Exchanges Should Take a Hard Look at IP Address-Masking Services,"Richard Malish is General Counsel at NICE Actimize where he counsels on global anti-money laundering, fraud, trading compliance and banking regulatory matters.      The New York Attorney General (""NY AG"") recently issued a report on its fact-finding enquiries to multiple virtual currency trading platforms believed to be operating in New York. One of its many interesting findings was how virtual private networks (""VPNs"") may permit market manipulation.  VPNs are a critical tool for privacy-minded cryptocurrency traders, as well as the only method for some traders to access these markets in countries such as China. Based on the NY AG's report, should crypto exchanges assume that VPN access is no longer permissible?  Not necessarily, but they need to look at the issue in the broader context of their overall compliance program.  Stepping back, the NY AG's focus on VPNs was in the context of the effectiveness of access controls to ensure fairness and integrity and protect customers. Access controls start with basic Know Your Customer (""KYC"") processes to confirm a new customer's identity.  While eight of the trading platforms which responded to the enquiry required customers to submit various forms of personal information and government-issued identification before trading, Bitfinex requires little more than an email address to trade between exchanges (as opposed to withdrawing/depositing fiat currency). Tidex, which states that it prohibits users from the United States and is currently filing with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to become a money services business, requires only a name, email address and phone number.  A common additional access control for online businesses is to monitor IP addresses of users to determine their approximate geographic location and track suspicious behavior coming from a particular computer connection. For example, transactions in multiple accounts coming from one IP address may be suspicious. Simultaneous access from IP addresses which are not in proximity could be a sign of fraud or a cyberattack.  IP addresses can also be masked using VPNs which route connectivity through a third-party network. This permits an individual to feign residency in a different jurisdiction or open several accounts and pretend that they are not related. Companies which block VPN access, such as Netflix and Hulu, most likely are screening access against a known list of VPN servers. These controls are not fool-proof since VPN services often change server IP addresses to stay one step ahead (as those using VPN to access Facebook or crypto exchanges from China, where unlicensed VPNs are illegal, can validate).  While most of the exchanges that responded to the NY AG reported that they monitor access by IP address, only two claimed to limit VPN access. The two exchanges, Bitstamp and Poloniex (now a part of Circle), have both withdrawn from various jurisdictions due to regulatory issues.  Wash trading  In addition to making sure that IP addresses from New York are not provided access to unauthorized exchanges, the NY AG raised concern that crypto exchanges which neither require documentation to execute a trade nor take active measures to block access via VPN may not be able to address manipulative or abusive trading activity.  For example, one individual may open up two accounts and engage in wash trades, which occur when traders buy and sell the same asset repeatedly to create the false appearance of market activity to move prices.  Unfortunately, wash trades are believed to be common in crypto markets because exchanges are ranked based on trading volume.  One report estimates over 7 of the top 10 exchanges engage in excessive wash trading from 12x to over 100x their true volume, and one is believed to inflate its trading 4,400x.  Money laundering  VPN access can also pose risks from an anti-money laundering perspective. Virtual currency exchangers have been subject to the Bank Secrecy Act's anti-money laundering requirements since as early as 2011. Failure to comply with KYC requirements can result in large penalties, such as the $700,000 fine assessed by FinCEN against Ripple Labs in 2015.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has also stated that it will treat digital currencies the same as fiat currencies, and sanctions violations carry strict liability which does not require intent to violate the law to be proven.  FinCEN has been focused on IP addresses mentioned in suspicious activity reports (SARs) for many years. In 2014 the agency reported that an investigation of IP addresses mentioned in SARs found 975 hits for possible Tor network addresses, corresponding to reports totaling nearly $24 million in likely fraudulent activity.  However, before the advent of cryptocurrencies, it was unlikely that FinCEN would expect the filing of a SAR just because of the use of different VPN addresses. Some banks have restricted VPN access to websites, but policies differ between firms.  New rules unlikely, but...  It will be interesting to see if the purely online nature of cryptocurrencies, and perhaps the growth of digital banks, will result in heightened U.S. regulatory scrutiny of VPNs. It appears unlikely that prescriptive federal VPN rules will be passed any time soon given the conservative approach taken by regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on more fundamental issues related to cryptocurrency.  As of today the NY AG report ostensibly is only a platform to educate the public and provide a number of questions that consumers should ask to protect themselves when considering various exchanges. Although three of the four exchanges which failed to respond to the inquiry, Binance, Gate.io, and Kraken, were reported to the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) for potential violation of the state's virtual currency regulations, it is unclear whether the NY AG report will encourage the DFS or other regulators to force digital currency exchanges to prohibit VPNs.  Rather, cryptocurrency exchanges will most likely be forced to reckon with VPN access as part of any regulatory or law enforcement actions for market manipulation, which could come any day. The DFS in February 2018 already reminded virtual currency businesses to implement measures to deter market manipulation.  And the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly been working with the CFTC on a criminal probe of possible market manipulation in crypto markets since at least the summer. The CFTC proved that it takes market manipulation related to cryptocurrency seriously as early as 2015 when it settled wash trade charges against TeraExchange for the fairly innocuous offense of reporting one test bitcoin swap transaction as a real transaction.  Conclusion  Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the U.S. or doing business with customers in the U.S. should promptly review their policies for verifying and monitoring authorized access.  If your business desires to continue to permit masked VPN addresses, the decision should be made in consideration of other controls and the damage that market manipulation or anti-money laundering charges would have on your firm's business. For example, facial recognition access controls might be considered as an alternative method to prevent one person trading across several accounts.  However, if your exchange currently permits users to open multiple accounts, has no market manipulation policy or is actively encouraging market manipulation to increase your market cap rankings, VPN may only be a footnote in your eventual enforcement action.
