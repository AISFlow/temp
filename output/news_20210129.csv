42405804,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeojUl,1611959280,"All Over the World, Small Investors Jump Into the GameStop Frenzy","The world is watching U.S. markets with great interest, and more than a little FOMO, as Reddit investors continue to test their might against Wall Street.      It all started when retail investors on the Reddit community wallstreetbets began pumping the price of U.S. video game retailer GameStop’s (GME) stock to counter Wall Street hedge funds that were “shorting” or betting against it. What the Reddit group did, and the reaction of the mainstream as the stock skyrocketed, reminded many of crypto trading.      Meanwhile, the world watches, with some seeing what happened with GameStop as a more global story of ordinary investors taking on the power of big institutions.      “We are very much interested in what is happening in the U.S. for many reasons. For some of us, it is the feeling that we can now also play in the market and we are also seeing how the markets actually get manipulated to serve only the rich. This isn't a movie. … We saw this happen,” Bernard Parah, founder and chief executive officer of Nigerian crypto trading startup Bitnob, told CoinDesk via an email.      According to Parah, Nigerian investors were buying GME using a number of apps including Bamboo and Trove, which allow U.S. equity trading.      In India, small retail investors were quick to jump in on the action, with GameStop becoming one of the top five traded stocks on Stockal, a platform used by Indian investors to trade U.S. equities, according to Bloomberg.      Retail investors in China also wanted in, with some users excitedly sharing their gains on social media. There are about 177 million retail investors in China.      Read More: After GME, Dogecoin and Bitcoin, Chinese Traders Are Betting What Will Pump Next      After the U.S. retail trading platform Robinhood limited users from buying certain trending stocks including GME, European investors who still had access continued to trade: wallstreetbets alleged that they helped keep the GME price up despite the trading restrictions.      “GME makes you feel the power of the people around the world. … After the Europeans, Asian people are joining the fight to support the movement. It makes your blood boil just by watching it,” one Chinese user wrote on popular social media app Weibo.      Meanwhile, the Reddit investors’ strategy to counter shorted stocks went global, according to Bloomberg journalist Tracy Alloway: Bloomberg reported earlier this week that heavily shorted stocks were rallying in Australia and Japan. Nikkei Asia reported the same trend was seen in Hong Kong and Malaysia.    Crypto Spillover    The turmoil didn’t stop there. Soon, Reddit investors were pumping other shorted or meme stocks including dogecoin (DOGE), a cryptocurrency that was created as a joke. DOGE started rallying after a Twitter user calling himself the chairman of wallstreetbets (though who is not affiliated with the subreddit) asked followers about the cryptocurrency.      Responding to the hype, Nigerian social payments app Bundle Africa listed dogecoin on Friday. An hour later, it was the second-most bought asset on Bundle that day.      “We are definitely feeling the spillover in crypto as people move to buy DOGE as a reaction to what’s been happening in the U.S.,” Yele Bademosi, chief executive officer of Bundle, told CoinDesk via Twitter.

Some users in Japan watched the dogecoin price run with skepticism, with one user comparing it to a local meme-based cryptocurrency called monacoin.      ""It is a remarkable activity in the market this week, and one which is yet to be determined as healthy or otherwise,” Jon Squires, chief executive officer of crypto exchange Currency.com, told CoinDesk.      According to Squires, on Thursday, the platform had 10 times the typical number of new clients.      In Nigeria, Parah says there has been a lot of activity in the various investor communities.      “Even on Whatsapp statuses, you have people asking things like, ""What is a short squeeze?"" or ""What does it mean to short?”...

42385819,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOUNL,1611958478,Aave's Founder Angel Invests to Grow DeFi's Head Start on the Banks,"Stani Kulechov used to think angel investing would distract him from leading his company, Aave, one of the top money markets in decentralized finance (DeFi).      Attention on Aave proved to be well spent: This time last year, Aave only had a few million dollars worth of crypto in it; since then it has risen to become the second-largest DeFi project on Ethereum, with over $3 billion in crypto committed to its smart contracts.      Nevertheless, over the last year Kulechov also invested in something like three-dozen projects. Clearly, his stance on angel investing has changed.      ""I think everyone should do angel investing in the space, especially if you gained,"" Kulechov told CoinDesk in an interview.      Kulechov justifies devoting part of his time to angel investing because he has come to see it as a defensive move for his company. It's like the internet: Once enough people have started using and relying on a tech stack, it becomes very nearly impossible to yank it back out of their hands.      ""When the ecosystem is big enough, I believe it is very difficult at that point to fight against the technology,"" Kulechov said.      The best the banking system could hope to do, he believes, is decide to build its own version of DeFi, but ""that will not work when you have so many projects in the ecosystem and the ecosystem is growing all the time,"" Kulechov said.    Dark forest    The term ""ecosystem"" gets thrown around a lot but Kulechov contends it is uniquely apt in DeFi.      In an ecosystem, things are living off each other but also supporting each other. Species evolve in a specific context and everything is relative. Kulechov sees the same thing happening on Ethereum.      ""An ecosystem means you are sharing things together. You are sharing, you are consuming and you are supplying, and you are doing all of these three things together,"" he said.      Take Yearn Finance for example. It takes advantage of composability by building other smart contracts into its smart contracts. In exchange, it also pumps a lot of additional liquidity into those protocols by way of its own various interfaces. It also consumes the yield that comes from the backers it supplies. It's a virtuous cycle.      ""We have smart contracts and we have composability,"" Kulechov said, ""but also we have an element of human composability.""      Kulechov backs a lot of teams but not everyone. The question he's trying to answer when making picks is: How creative is this team? He said he likes to ask them what they are looking to build next and then maybe after that as well. He needs to see a fertile mind that's always ready to innovate, because that's the only way to keep adding value.    Picks    CoinDesk sees Kulechov's name on press releases about new startups all the time. For example, we've reported his backing of Lido, Maple,Slingshot, Swivel and PoolTogether.      Aave itself raised a fresh $25 million last October ahead of releasing its new version in December.      But when asked to name some investments that are on his mind, he named three specific ones he's made in small, new teams that haven't gotten a ton of attention yet.      Pods Finance: a derivatives product that's designed to work without oracles.      Kulechov said he liked Pods because it has a team of very young people from Brazil who were traveling around to hackathons to build out early versions of their product.      Certora: a smart-contract security consultancy that specializes in formal verification.      ""It's kind of a traditional business model,"" Kulechov said. Certora stands out in the crypto space because it's a bunch of security researchers who simply provide a service in exchange for payment, without a token or DAO in sight.      Shell Protocol: an upstart automated market maker (AMM) for stablecoins aiming to enable money for the internet.      ""What for me was interesting was the whole story of how they moved to Hawaii,"" Kulechov said. The team has a ""Hawaii House"" on the beach listed as a perk for new hires. New employees aren't required to live there but encouraged to at least come and hang out a while.      Kulechov said he's been pleased to see some decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators routing orders through this relatively small protocol, which has a big mission to reinvent money. That said, ""They don't make any noise,"" Kulechov said.    Principles    Kulechov contends he doesn't have strict investing principles, but obviously he likes to see people embrace DeFi values: transparency, open source and the like.      One point he does like to stress, though, is he prefers to make investments in the tokens generated by his own project, Aave. So rather than sending a team a bunch of USDC, he'd rather send them aUSDC, because then they already have some yield built in.      Treasury management is obviously important for any team, but: ""If you take interest-bearing tokens, it's actually managed,"" Kulechov said.      The point there is to keep projects sustainable on the micro level. Investing does the same for DeFi on the macro level.      ""I spend my whole day in DeFi,"" Kulechov said, noting that most of his hours are focused on Aave. The remainder, though, often goes to angel investing. ""I think everyone should do this,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | YFI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/29/aaves-founder-angel-invests-to-grow-defis-head-start-on-the-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d4b80967fab05b70ca7d2b728e38b528f690ef4-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At the end of last year, then-President Trump’s Working Group on Financial Markets released a report that said stablecoins should meet the same regulatory standards as other aspects of the financial system.

42385827,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOUW9,1611956136,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Bumps to $38.6K While DeFi Exchanges Hit $50B,"Analysts believe Elon Musk’s shout-out to crypto pushed bitcoin’s price upwards at a time when decentralized exchanges are experiencing record amounts of trading volume on the Ethereum network. Excessive fees could damp that, however.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $34,616 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 5.9% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $31,984-$38,566 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC well above the 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price jumped massively Friday. In the span of an hour, starting at 9:00 UTC (4 a.m. ET), the world’s oldest cryptocurrency gained 11%, going from $33,377 to $37,113 according to CoinDesk 20 data. Over the next five hours, bitcoin hit a 24-hour high of $38,566 before increased sell orders started to take over the market, with the price per 1 BTC at $34,616 as of press time.      Read More: Kraken, Coinbase Suffer Outages Amid Market Volatility      Analysts point to the legendary social media habits of serial entrepreneur Elon Musk as a catalyst for bitcoin’s Friday price pop. “Elon’s ‘bitcoin’ logo added to his Twitter feed kicked us off on the aggressive move higher,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “His comments triggered huge buy stop losses on Binance and likely the other Asian exchanges as leveraged traders had to close their short positions.”      Read More: Musk-Prompted Bitcoin Price Surge Causes Liquidation of $387M in Shorts      Indeed, total liquidations across the entire crypto market over the past 24 hours was the highest in three months, at over $850 million on the short side, according to aggregator Bybt. Liquidations are the crypto equivalent of a margin call: When a leverage trader’s position moves against price, it is bought or sold automatically to begin to wipe out any potential liability.      “The red pullback is absolutely natural given how much we have moved,” Swissquote’s Thomas added. “We’ll likely find a new base – perhaps with $35,000 support – and trade sideways to slightly higher, assuming no more news.”      Some good news for brokerages: Crypto spot volumes perked up Friday, to $8.7 billion as of press time, the second-highest level over the past month, according to the eight USD/BTC exchanges the CoinDesk 20 tracks.      Prior to the Musk motions, the crypto market had been in the doldrums. “Investors were focused on other big events like earnings and the [Federal Reserve],” noted David Russell, vice president of market intelligence for trading platform TradeStation. “They would have come back to crypto regardless because of the institutional adoption trend, but Musk lit a fire under their feet.”      Funding rates for long leverage are jumping to a level not seen since bitcoin’s record high Jan. 8, when the price hit $41,962, according to CoinDesk 20 data. It’s a sign traders are emboldened by the short liquidations to fuel up some long trades right now.      It will be interesting to see how bitcoin performs over the weekend because crypto never sleeps. Major equities indexes on Friday are awash in red. Could traders jump on cryptocurrency markets to find weekend opportunities?    Asia’s Nikkei 225 index ended the day falling 1.9% as investors looked to rebalance portfolios amid market volatility at the end of the month.  In Europe the FTSE 100 closed in the red 1.8% as concerns about speculative trading and coronavirus vaccine supply issues led to market selling.  In the United States, the S&P 500 slipped 1.6% with traders taking profits as concerns mount a speculative bubble may leave some investors in perilous positions.    “This has been a tremendous week for retail trading across multiple asset classes,” noted James Putra, head of product strategy at Tradestation. “Since most other asset classes are closed later today, we are excited to see if the 24/7 crypto markets benefit from the retail trading enthusiasm.”    DEX volumes hit $50 billion in January monthly volume    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday trading around $1,348 and climbing 0.81% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Monthly decentralized exchange, or DEX, volumes for major projects in the Ethereum ecosystem have eclipsed $50 billion, according to data aggregator Dune Analytics.      In first place is long-standing bellwether Uniswap, with $23.3 billion for January so far, almost half of the total volume. Uniswap is followed by $10 billion by its smart contract fork rival SushipSwap and then $5.8 billion for stablecoin-focused exchange Curve. “I trade a lot on DEXs. They have deeper liquidity and less slippage than traditional exchanges,” noted Michael Gord, chief executive of trading firm Global Digital Assets.      However, Peter Chan, head trader at quantitative firm OneBit Quant, cautioned that centralized exchanges (CEX) still rule despite the record volumes on DEXs. “This is remarkable and I am happy for the development of DeFi,” Chan told CoinDesk, referring to decentralized finance. “But it's still a long way to go compared to volumes on a CEX.”      According to CoinGecko, volume the past 24 hours on centralized exchange Binance was $34 billion as of press time.      Chan noted that DEX fees can also be staggering. “Gas price is still going to be a major problem for DEXs. Especially for small trades, gas fees could take up to 20%-30% of the trade.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Friday, mostly higher. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    xrp (XRP) + 7.7%  stellar (XLM) + 7.4%  litecoin (LTC) + 3%    In addition, meme-focused cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE), which is not currently part of the CoinDesk 20, has seen a price appreciation of over 120% over the past 24 hours, mostly because of high activity on social media.

42421787,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXq0HF,1611956095,The GameStop Stop Is Not a Technology Problem,"You may have heard: Yesterday, amid an enormous rally in the stock and surging trading volumes, Robinhood halted the ability of its users to trade GameStop (GME) stock. Chaos ensued. Retail traders everywhere cried foul, accusing the startup brokerage of protecting hedge funds and the establishment at their expense. U.S. politicians across the spectrum, from Rep. AOC to Sen. Ted Cruz, came together to lambast the move on Twitter. Venture capitalists and technologists called into question the morality of Robinhood’s founders and proclaimed that the moment for decentralization had finally arrived.      Robinhood did not halt trading of GameStop to punish the insurgent mass of retail traders. Nor did it do so out of a paternalistic impulse to try to protect them. Robinhood halted trading of GameStop because it had to, thanks to a set of standards put in place by market players upstream. Robinhood’s clearing firm, the company that facilitates the settlement of the broker-dealer’s trades, could not keep up with the risk it was being asked to take on.    Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.    Clearing firms exist in part to mitigate the consequences should a broker-dealer fail to meet its obligations. Clearing firms therefore need to keep a tight handle on risk. This means they need to put up more money to make good on trades as markets get wackier and wackier (that is, as volatility increases). The GameStop market was about as wacky as it gets. The clearing firm couldn’t take on any more risk. Robinhood couldn’t fork over any more funds to the clearing firm. The music had to stop.      These are precisely the type of controls that became so clearly important in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis: strict risk management, transparency, liquidity thresholds, and capital requirements. These standards were designed to prevent reckless behavior and to mitigate the fallout should a financial firm become overexposed. When retail traders demanded these rules be implemented on big institutions 10 years ago, they couldn’t have imagined those rules would someday shut them out of the market.      Yesterday highlights the importance of understanding all of the boring nuances of trading back offices and the standards, rules, regulations and protocols that go along with them. Settling a trade takes two days. Thus, clearing firms have two days of exposure to their counterparty firm.      See also: Jill Carlson - GameStop and the Real Market Manipulators      Why does it take two days? People love to say this is a technology issue and that innovations like blockchains can fix this. The reality is, as with so many things that people claim blockchains can fix that this issue is almost entirely one of process and regulation. Perhaps new technology can be a catalyst to revisit these, but it is certainly not the limiting factor.      The Securities and Exchange Commission mandates settlement periods for securities to keep processes among counterparties running smoothly. There are plenty of short-term securities that do settle the same day like certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Equities take as long as they do in part because of historical precedent, dating from the times when technology was indeed the constraint. Every financial institution became accustomed to the processes involved in multi-day settlement periods. Financial institutions are generally slowly evolving creatures, meaning that which they are used to is that which they prefer. Because their processes are built around multi-day settlement, they continue to choose multi-day settlement. The solution to this is not a blockchain anymore than it is a centralized database.    Robinhood halted trading of GameStop because it had to, thanks to a set of standards put in place by market players upstream.    It is so tempting to turn these conversations into conversations about technology. If only we had a decentralized financial trading platform, we would be saved from the censorship imposed by Robinhood or clearing firms or the SEC, the thinking goes. If only we had equities on a blockchain, we would be saved from two day settlement periods and the risks and inefficiencies they impose.      But the issues lie not with the technology. They lie with the way the protocols, processes, rules and laws around the market were designed. And these kinds of issues do not go away no matter how decentralized your trading venue is or how many blockchains you are using.      There are, to be sure, many archaic and obsolete practices that those in charge of the markets continue to adhere to. But it is all too easy to blindly rail against these or to blame them on technology without examining where these practices came from or why they exist. In the most extreme cases, these processes prevail for risk management reasons. In more innocuous cases, these practices simply emerged from the human behavior of those interacting with the markets.      See also: Preston Byrne - ‘The Squeezening’: How the GameStop Backlash Will Curtail Freedom      When XRP was de-platformed earlier this month by Coinbase and many others there was not a sudden rush of liquidity and activity on decentralized exchanges that list the asset. That is because traders did not want to touch the asset given the regulatory concerns around the asset.      Take also the question of whether markets should be open and active 24 hours, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. This is another area where I frequently hear people saying that new technology would resolve this, pointing to cryptocurrency markets that are always open. But there are already plenty of mainstream markets that are always open. All over-the-counter markets work this way on Wall Street. If I want to do an over-the-counter trade, I can theoretically call up a market maker any time and ask for a price. In all likelihood, though, I don’t want to. I want to wait for times when there is liquidity.      So much of how the financial market works is based on historical human behaviors, either codifying them into market standards or erecting guardrails against their natural tendencies. To be sure, developments of the last weeks and years demonstrate that many of these policies and procedures are worth revisiting. Cryptocurrency markets have proven that there might be demand for 24/7 markets, at least in some asset classes. GameStop has shown that certain retail broker-dealers might need to be better capitalized to anticipate the kind of groundswell behavior we have seen this week.      Innovations like blockchains and decentralized exchanges may continue to prove more of these assumptions and behaviors wrong in the 21st century. And for that purpose, they are important. But technology itself is not the solution.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jill Gunter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/29/the-gamestop-stop-is-not-a-technology-problem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0886418c5f3314d9f54de30de34641300d776802-1420x1031.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385820,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOUM5,1611954459,Are You Running a Bitcoin Node?,"“Are you running the numbers?”      This is what Bitcoin Core developer Andrew Chow is trying to find out in a new survey.      Sponsored by a grant from MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, Chow crafted the survey “to get answers from people who are not current users” about why they don’t run a Bitcoin Core full node, the wallet software which simultaneously keeps a record of Bitcoin’s transaction history and connects users to other peers in the network.      Bitcoin full nodes are like servers so, if you’re not running your own to broadcast transactions to the wider network, then you’re relying on someone else’s.      Moreover, a full node offers users complete control over what encoded rules they want to follow, as well as the ability to independently verify a variety of network data. The popular Bitcoin memes “One node, one vote” and “Run the numbers” demonstrate that these principles of self-verifiability and freedom of choice are core principles for Bitcoin’s most fervent followers.      In short, running a full node is the ultimate exercise in financial self-determination in the Bitcoin realm.    Read more: Becoming Self-Sovereign: How to Set Up a Bitcoin Node, With Lightning    So that’s why Chow launched the survey, which runs until March 2, to give developers an “idea of the biggest barriers facing people who might want to run a node but currently do not.” The inspiration came from a conversation with fellow developers about the removal of a little-known wallet feature for Bitcoin Core.      “Several months ago, a few other Bitcoin Core developers and I were discussing the removal of a feature called zapwallettxes. The main question that we had was whether anyone actually used it. This basically led to the general sentiment of wishing to know how users actually use Bitcoin Core,” he told CoinDesk in a direct message.    Bitcoin Core usage survey    The survey’s first questions establish the basics: where are you from, how’d you find the survey, do you run a Bitcoin Core full node?      If the respondent replies that they do run a node, the survey follows up by asking if they use the Bitcoin Core wallet and if they ever have in the past. If you do run a node, the survey will continue to grill you over the specifics of your use: how often you update, what other software/hardware you use, why you run a node, etc.      If you don’t run a node, the survey asks you what wallet you use if you own bitcoin and what barriers have kept you from running a node, be they technical complexity or otherwise.    How many Bitcoin nodes are there?    Measuring the total number of active nodes on the Bitcoin network is tricky, because some nodes may choose to be open to connect to any other node (a “listening node”), while others may choose to keep their connections closed and private (a “non-listening node”)      Still, one of the more accurate metrics comes from prolific Bitcoin developer Luke Dash Jr., whose data estimates there are roughly 83,000 Bitcoin Core nodes currently active (and just over 1,100 or so of Bitcoin’s other few software versions).      This is long shy of the 200,000 Bitcoin nodes that were running back at the peak of 2017’s market cycle, according to the same data, but still more than the 40,000 or so that were operating in the aftermath of March 2020’s historic sell-off.    Better-than-expected response    So far, the survey has 600 recorded responses, which is more than Chow and his peers projected for the early stages of the survey, which will run for roughly five more weeks.      Chow said he plans to publish the data he collects once it’s fully analyzed, adding that “there are no plans to act on the results.” Bitcoin’s development is distributed, after all, so coordinating around specific changes for the diversity of users in the survey isn’t practical.      “Instead [the answers] will help us when there is a question about how users behave. There could be direct changes as a result of the survey, but that depends on the results. The survey is being conducted as more of an overarching ‘what are our users doing?’ rather than trying to figure out some specific feature or detail that we should be doing.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/29/are-you-running-a-bitcoin-node,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54b69bbc145dab2e45627a01d910d81fdf7faf6e-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We just wanted to keep you updated as we work to get the system back online. We apologize for the inconvenience.""      At press time, Voyager's support team sent out at least four emails to its users addressing the service disruptions since the platform's first tweet on Thursday about dogecoin. In that first tweet the trading platform asked users to tell their friends about Voyager with a link to guidance of how to buy and trade the skyrocketing cryptocurrency.      Angry users appear to have taken their dissatisfaction to Twitter, too. As one user wrote: ""Voyager is the reason I missed out on [DOGE] at 25% this morning. I was digging it until my deposit was continually denied. The thousands I've missed out on brings much shame.""      A spokesperson representing Voyager told CoinDesk that Voyager's platform experienced ""an unprecedented amount of volume and traffic"" after retail traders from Reddit and Robinhood began migrating into cryptocurrencies. The ""rapid"" growth in trading activity on Voyager generated 150% more accounts in just 24 hours, the spokesperson added.      ""While we had internally scaled our system ten times to handle the influx, what we saw after was of an order of magnitude higher, and ultimately required our system to go offline for further scaling,"" according to the email response from Voyager's spokesperson. The platform recognized significant spikes of trading volumes in dogecoin, its own voyager token, as well as bitcoin.      In a Thursday email from Voyager's support team reviewed by CoinDesk, Voyager claimed the service disruption was due to ""an unexpected event from a system upgrade."" Another email sent on Friday noted ""immense ongoing volume"" from both ""new accounts and trading.""      ""All funds are safe,"" according to Friday's email. ""While we experience these volume increases, the Voyager app may periodically undergo maintenance periods to ensure systems are able to operate efficiently during this surge in demand.""

42385823,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOUPr,1611950002,"After GME, Dogecoin and Bitcoin, Chinese Traders Are Betting What Will Pump Next","Rallies in GameStock (NYSE: GME) shares as well as dogecoin (DOGE) and bitcoin (BTC) are piquing the betting interest of traders in China as much as they are in the United States.      On Weibo, the popular social media platform in China, the highly active crypto community is speculating on which cryptocurrency will be next to get a major pump after dogecoin and bitcoin jumped in recent days.      “Were it not that Ripple was struggling with its lawsuit, the next token being pumped by the retailers in the U.S. could have been XRP,"" according to one Weibo account holder with nearly 40,000 followers. “Many newcomers to crypto only look at prices and names, and they do not care how many times this particular token has taken away people’s money or whether it is highly centralized.”      “It might be a good time to look into tokens that’re associated with XRP the most,” the post then continued, which was followed by several responses asking whether Stellar lumens (XLM) would be the next token to pump. Prices for XLM were trading at $0.304 at press time, up 13.96% in the past 24 hours and outperforming bitcoin, according to the CoinDesk 20.    Read more: Stellar’s XLM Token Rallies to 2-Year High on XRP Woes, OCC Ruling, Ukraine    It’s not just on Weibo. Chinese internet users have been surfing on English-based social media platforms including Telegram chat groups and Reddit, where the most recent bout of trading frenzy started originally. A tweet by Tron’s Justin Sun, which said he’d buy $1 million worth of GameStop stock to show his support to the Reddit community, was briefly pinned on the reddit group, r/wallstreetbets, the epicenter of the GME drama.      “Justin Sun (Asian billionaire) has our back and is joining in,” the group's post says. After the post went out, prices for the tron (TRX) cryptocurrency rose as high as $0.0446, up 52.2% from its 24-hour low at $0.0293, according to Messari.      The post also led to what appeared to be an accidental rally in shares of Tanzanian Gold Corporation, which has the ticker symbol TRX. That stock doubled in price in earlier Friday and is still up 26% on the day as of press time, according to Yahoo Finance.      “Every stock investor is thinking of how to buy cryptocurrencies,” Yang Liu, a Colorado-based Chinese crypto retail trader, told CoinDesk. “Every crypto investor is thinking of how to buy stocks.”      Yang saw the early movement on Reddit and bought shares of GME last week, right before GME’s prices skyrocketed. He told CoinDesk many friends and family in China have been asking him over the past two days which tokens they should buy.      “In China, the fear of missing out (FOMO) has surpassed the fear of losing money,” Yang said, adding that many Chinese have been trading American stocks since the start of the lockdown in 2020 using platforms such as FutuBull, and Forex.com.      Data from a December report by the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation shows there are more than 177 million individual stock investors in China. Unlike the market in the U.S., the stock market in China is dominated by retail investors. The Chinese stock market is also highly regulated, with short-selling very rare. It introduced a circuit break system after 2015's stock market crisis, in which stock exchanges would force the suspension of trading for the day should the CSI 300 Index rise or fall by 7% or more from its previous close. The circuit breaker rule, however, has been suspended since the beginning of 2016 when it was triggered twice.      The battle between retail traders and financial elites is also nothing new to hundreds of millions of traders in China. They often half-jokingly describe themselves as “leeks,” a common vegetable in China, “being harvested” when they think their money has been “stolen” by the much bigger market players in the traditional stock market.      “Sending support to retailers in the U.S,” one Weibo user commented under a post by Chinese state media The Paper about trading platform Robinhood stopping buy orders on GameStop.    Read more: Retail Traders Sue Robinhood Over Meme Stock Restrictions    That said, it is hard to gauge whether China’s participation in the GME surge is much more than FOMO. Some say that while retail traders are jumping into certain stocks or cryptocurrencies, it may be more about taking advantage of an opportunity rather than a shift in ideology.      “It doesn’t matter whether it’s the GameStop drama or the dogecoin pump. From what we see, the retail investors in China are not deeply or actively engagement in the real ‘revolution’ behind [the trading frenzy],'"" Flex Yang, founder and chief executive of Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance, told CoinDesk.

42385825,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOUSN,1611946065,"Blockchain Bites: DOGE, Musk, Robinhood, GameStop and Crypto's 'Populist' Revolution","Three stories    1. Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio to #bitcoin and the crypto jumped 20%, to highs last seen on Jan. 19. The two events are not definitely connected. However, just 15 minutes after Musk made the change, bitcoin climbed 15.7% to $37,050. It’s still ticking up.      Of course, with any rally, celebrity-driven or not, the question comes to stability. Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant’s “Exchange Whale Ratio” found that exchange inflows among major bitcoin holders is at an eight-month high, signaling a possible price drop.    However, “Elon’s tweet overrides all other bearish signals,” Ki-Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, tweeted. In a follow-up tweet, Musk appears to nod to bitcoin, saying “In retrospect, it was inevitable,” a quote later imbedded into the cryptocurrency’s blockchain by mining pool F2Pool.  The sharp rise to a 10-day high of $38,020 sparked $387 million worth of bitcoin short liquidations on major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, BitMEX, ByBit, Deribit, FTX, HuobiDM and OKEx.    Musk has frequently shown support for crypto broadly. Industry publication Protos found nearly every time he mentions a cryptocurrency, it rallies.    DOGE was the most talked about cryptocurrency on Twitter, including a cryptic picture of a dog in a sweater posing on the cover of a magazine, which Musk posted in the midst of a market rally. (The symbol of dogecoin is a Shiba Inu while the featured dog in Musk’s tweet appears to be an Italian Greyhound.)  Dogecoin climbed 800% Thursday to a record high of about $0.082 per coin. At one point, the meme coin entered the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.    2. In another story about meme-driven market mayhem, Robinhood has limited cryptocurrency buying due to ""extraordinary market conditions.” Traders can ""still use settled funds to buy crypto,"" a spokesperson said.    This is the second day in a row that Robinhood trading functionality hit up against the limits of memetic demand. Yesterday, a near-revolution formed after the popular trading app placed limits on stocks favored by the Reddit day-trading community WallStreetBets.  In what is shaping up to be the biggest trade of the century, a loosely organized group of retail traders attempted to put the squeeze on short-selling hedge funds. It started with GameStop, but spread to other company stocks with less than ideal prospects, like Kodak and AMC. And the mobbed moved markets, even raising questions of whether it was “manipulation.”    Just as the “degenerate traders,” a term often used sympathetically in Discord cesspools and on Reddit, the “man” looked to put its foot down. Lines of communication were cut (sorta) and Robinhood and Webull, the very disruptors that – per their own adverts – were democratizing finance, limited trading in a move that benefited short sellers.    Both the U.S. House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee announced there would be hearings on short-selling and online trading platforms. Traders filed lawsuits.  The moment has drawn comparisons to Occupy Wall Street, an anarchic protest movement that brought economic inequality to light.    Amid swirling rumors of collusion and political grandstanding, Robinhood said yesterday the pause on trading has been misunderstood. CEO Vlad Tenev said the company wasn’t “directed by a market maker or any other market participant, to pause stocks that had seen triple-digit returns, but made the decision based on a “technical and operational” considerations.    Turns out, the financial system’s physical and digital plumbing has capacity limits. Of course there have been calls to decentralize. Cryptocurrency company FTX has already listed a WallStreetBets (WSB) index, which will be mirrored on Blockfolio, capitalizing on the whole mess.    3. Coinbase is about 3.5 times the size of Robinhood, which is definitely notable and also a lame way to segue into news that the massive exchange intends to go public through a direct listing.    Yesterday, the firm confirmed rumors of an IPO through direct listing. Though the official documentation filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is not yet available. The firm's announcement Thursday included no details on when the stock would be listed or under which ticker.  In semi-related news, MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor said the firm will “explore various approaches” to continue buying bitcoin. The company holds 70,784 BTC, and has previously used Coinbase as a means to buy.  At stake    Decentralization blooms? The retail-driven rally across several “meme stocks” has become a narrative opportunity for calls to “decentralize.” Painting with broad strokes, crypto influencers have viewed the week’s events as the power of the masses rising up against centralized gatekeepers and legacy institutions.      Connecting the dots to the crypto industry, noted technologist Balaji Srinivasan said, “Crypto and WallStreetBets have the same spirit: a vision of truly free markets where everyone plays by the same rules.” A disparate group of traders, banned together by social networks like Reddit and Discord, now, conceivably, can have as much influence on markets as Wall Street, Srinivasan argued.      The movement is much bigger than what’s happening with a few stocks. Similar references to decentralization were made after social media giants, including Twitter and Facebook, took the unprecedented step to ban now-former President Donald Trump from their platforms while he was still in office.      In short, the battle lines are being drawn around private companies – which were once seen as democratizing forces but have trended towards “illiberalism” – versus open-source platforms that anyone can use, indisputably and in perpetuity.      The problem isn’t necessarily about companies curating their platforms, like Robinhood temporarily limiting trading of a few overheated stocks or Twitter removing QAnon conspiracies, which, as we’ve covered before, is a First Amendment right, but about who gets to make the call.      The internet was envisioned as an open platform. It still is. But the World Wide Web we have today, the actual system that is so often conflated with the internet itself, is primarily mediated by a few tech giants. These companies – Google, Facebook and other household names – have become the interface people see when they log on. Their dark-house algorithms also surface the majority of content that is consumed online.      Decentralizing this stack, removing the “walled gardens,” is the work of the crypto movement, which is rapidly advancing towards Web 3.0, envisioned as a user-owned network. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is perhaps the highest-profile proponent of creating open protocols for social media.      A project he announced in late 2019, Blue Sky, recently released a report on the current state of the decentralized web. The obvious conclusion: There is much work to be done. One effort not covered in the Blue Sky report is a pretty clear example of this.      Revolution Populi announced the launch of its testnet today. It’s a blockchain-based solution meant “to decolonize the internet.” Developed by Yale computer science professor David Gelernter, sometimes credited as the creator of the first internet social network, and ex-Goldman Sachs Vice President Rob Rosenthal, Revolution Populi hopes to create an open source foundation where “a thousand social nets can bloom.”      It’s an ambitious goal, and one that faces numerous obstacles. When pitching itself as a “Facebook killer,” its founders told Forbes in 2019 it was eyeing a ""billion-dollar"" initial coin offering. That offering has yet to materialize, caught up in legal questions, Rosenthal said in an interview with CoinDesk’s Blockchain Bites yesterday.      Though Rosenthal said the project is “well capitalized” through private funding, there are other concerns. As experimental as experimental gets, the project is using a consensus algorithm, called random Delegated Proof Of Stake, which builds on the standard used in the EOS blockchain. Then there’s the project’s crypto clearinghouse to match trades.      “The cryptocurrency industry is screaming – screaming – for some measure of backstop against the spiraling crisis of counterparty risk,” Rosenthal said. It’s an infrastructure Rosenthal proposed as a way to monetize the system, though it is still being built. There are a few examples of clearinghouses already being used, like ErisX.      And as Messari notes, a blockchain already functions like a clearinghouse. “The Ethereum blockchain acts as the decentralized clearinghouse for transactions involving tokens and smart contracts. Ethereum currently settles billions in transactions every day without requiring a corporation like the [Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation] to ensure a transaction is completed.”      That said, crypto is inherently forward-looking and foundational technology across the ecosystem is still being laid out. Just weeks ago, for instance, Revolution Populi integrated with the decentralized app friendly Matic Network.      In some sense, what matters most in crypto is intention. The core idea being is to empower individuals, to flatten hierarchies and to lay a technological foundation that could never be co-opted by governments or corporations.      I was curious about Rosenthal’s take on the Robinhood dilemma, given his 19-year career at one of the world's most powerful investment banks, one that Matt Tiabbi referred to as “a great vampire squid.” If RevPop wants to kill Facebook, what’s next for Goldman?      There will be no bloodshed, the gray-haired former punk rocker said diplomatically.      “The point is, we're on the right side of history, which is a populist revolution. It’s a philosophy of decentralization, an idea around people controlling their own lives,” he said.      Whether it’s an alternative worth considering, I leave to you, dear reader, to decide.

42385811,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOUEX,1611945056,India Would Ban Private Cryptocurrencies Under Proposed Legislation,"The Indian Parliament will consider a government-introduced bill that would ban private cryptocurrencies in its upcoming budget session. Given the ruling party controls both houses of Parliament, the chances of the bill's passage are considered good.      According to the Lok Sabha Bulletin published Friday, the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, seeks to prohibit all cryptocurrencies in India and provide a framework for creating an official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).      While the bill is anti-private cryptocurrencies, it will allow certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses, the bulletin said. The India Parliament has three annual sessions: Budget session, which runs from January to March, Monsoon session and Winter session.      If the bill is approved, India would become the only major Asian economy to ban private cryptocurrencies rather than regulating them like corporate stocks.      The RBI, via a circular issued on April 6, 2018, had banned regulated entities from dealing in cryptocurrencies and providing services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or settling those. The central bank's banking ban was overruled by the Supreme Court in March 2020, bringing cheer to exchanges providing services to India-based clients.      Sumit Gupta, CEO of the Mumbai-based CoinDCX exchange, struck a hopeful note regarding the proposed legislation. ""Since the government is considering introducing the bill during this session of Parliament, we are sure the government will definitely listen to all the stakeholders before taking any decision,"" Gupta told CoinDesk.

42385808,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOU8F,1611944350,Ripple Responds to SEC Lawsuit Over XRP Sales,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is ignoring that the XRP cryptocurrency has utility, fintech startup Ripple alleged in its response to a securities complaint filed by the regulatory agency.      In a Friday filing, Ripple Labs pushed back against the SEC’s allegations, which claim the San Francisco-based firm violated U.S. securities laws for over seven years by selling $1.3 billion worth of XRP tokens.      “The functionality and liquidity of XRP are wholly incompatible with securities regulation. To require XRP’s registration as a security is to impair its main utility,” the response said.      In a 93-page filing, Ripple responded to each of the SEC’s paragraphs. In its affirmative defenses, Ripple stated that XRP is not a security or investment contract, and the firm’s sales or distributions of XRP are likewise not investment contracts.    Ripple rebuttal    The SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, alleging the company, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen sold over $1 billion in XRP, promoted the token and paid third parties to support the cryptocurrency.      Parts of Ripple's response seem to focus on what XRP actually does, in the company's view, saying the SEC complaint ignored that XRP is open source and claiming that its price has correlated with the price of bitcoin and ether.      ""The Complaint mischaracterizes advice that Ripple received in 2012, from which a reasonable reader actually would have concluded that Ripple Credits (a past name for XRP) were not a security,"" the filing adds a few paragraphs down.      Ripple is also claiming that the SEC did not provide fair notice that its sales of XRP might be violating the law.      It pointed to its settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in 2015, which registered XRP as a convertible virtual currency and allowed for sales and secondary market transactions.      “Upon information and belief, Plaintiff knew of that 2015 settlement and yet, for years after, Plaintiff provided Defendants with no clear notice that, in Plaintiff’s view, Defendants’ prospective XRP sales as permitted by the agreement would nevertheless constitute a violation of another federal law,” the response said.    Commodity clarity    In addition to filing its response, Ripple filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documents from the SEC on how it determined that bitcoin and ether, the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, are not securities.      “To date, they have offered no guidance for that determination, hindering responsible players like Ripple from being able to innovate in the U.S. to bring faster, cheaper and more transparent global payments to consumers who need them the most. As we have said for many years, we’re simply asking for the rules to be clearly stated and applied consistently,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

42385822,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOUR7,1611940271,Money Reimagined: Narratives Wall Street Can't Control,"Welcome to Money Reimagined.      This was the week the internet finally defeated Wall Street – at least for a few days. The wild rally in GameStop’s stock, fueled by an army of Reddit retail day traders, imposed devastating losses on hedge funds and showed how free trading tools and social media (memes) can now be harnessed by networks of individuals to achieve economic outcomes previously controlled by elites. The gobsmacking story of GameStop, Melvin Capital and r/WallStreetbets was tailor-made for the disruptive, anti-establishment vibe of the crypto community. This “WSB effect” theme runs throughout this week’s newsletter.      On the other side of the masses vs. establishment divide, this was also the week of the “Davos Agenda” virtual event, held in lieu of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. It included the likes of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Chinese President Xi Zinping, a host of Fortune 500 CEOs and so forth.      My podcast co-host Sheila Warren, who happens to be the WEF’s blockchain lead, invited long-time WEF Managing Director Adrian Monck to this week’s “Money Reimagined” show. We talked directly about how the old guard deals with the changes that radical outsiders, such as crypto developers and tribes of activist retail investors, present. Have a listen at the link below after reading this week’s newsletter.    BTC and ETH: Made for each other    As of 11:00 a.m. ET Friday, the year-to-date returns for bitcoin and ether show an easily discernible reversal of the BTC dominance seen in late 2020. Bitcoin is up 27% year to date and ether, 92%.    What’s going on here? Well, before wetry to answer that, a caveat: If the past week’s WallStreetBets-vs-hedge funds spectacle has taught us anything, it’s that in today’s meme-consuming, radically democratizing markets, confidently defining fundamental reasons for price movements is difficult. What matters is which narrative is winning.  Narrative? So prices are just make-believe? Well, yes, but stories have always been about how people – and thus markets – reach consensus. It used to be Wall Street controlled the narrative. It’s unclear whether that’s still the case.  So, what narrative best explains ETH outperforming BTC? Well, let’s first challenge the “Tulip Bubble” angle that mainstream crypto critics might instinctively apply here: The idea this is a rerun of the 2017 bitcoin rally, which pushed speculators into comparatively cheaper tokens only to foster the mother of all bubbles. The loss suffered this week by short-selling hedge funds at the expense of hordes of retail investors from the r/WallStreetBets subreddit shows it’s dangerous to conclude that large groups of determined bulls are inherently wrong.  This is not to say ETH’s price won’t correct as bitcoin’s has this month. It just means we owe it to ourselves to explore other narratives.   Such as? Here’s one: There’s a BTC-to-ETH price rotation going on that suggests thoughtful investors are starting to see Ethereum, and more specifically the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on it, as a constructive complement to Bitcoin. As sophisticated investors increasingly recognize bitcoin’s potential as a “digital gold” store of wealth, the thesis goes, they will soon see DeFi as a means to creatively unlock that value – for payments, for loans, for insurance, and so forth.  This take sees Bitcoin as the base layer protocol for a software stack that handles the internet’s value storage and exchange. Bitcoin the currency is a simple yet hard-to-change, highly secure store of value. Much like gold, it doesn’t do much; you just lock it away and use it as security to back up your other investments and financial activity. But because it’s built on a permissionless protocol, developers can still do many more creative things with it than, say, a gold custodian can do with bullion.  That’s where Ethereum and DeFi come in. With smart contracts, oracles, decentralized exchanges and multi-sig systems for securing digital assets, the degens of DeFi are now incorporating bitcoin into their freewheeling, “composable” world of decentralized financial products. Hence the summer explosion of wrapped bitcoin tokens such as WBTC.  To go back to the software stack analogy, Ethereum is middleware and DeFi occupies the application layer.  Analogies are also being made to the traditional finance “stack.” RealVision CEO Raoul Pal says bitcoin is “pristine collateral” that could even take on the $123 trillion market for U.S. Treasury bonds as the base-level security for all credit. It’s appeal is not only that it’s a provably scarce asset, but also that it can be locked up in escrow through a decentralized smart contract that leaves neither lenders nor borrowers vulnerable to the failures of a middleman. You build DeFi’s lending, borrowing and insuring products on top of that feature and you now have the makings of a financial system.  Now a mega-name celebrity investor is also warming to the thesis. Asked by CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser if he would ever see bitcoin as something more than a speculative investment, Dallas Mavericks owner and CNBC “Shark Tank” personality Mark Cuban responded, “Sure. If DeFi and BTC can evolve together in a manner that allows BTC to effectively be a bank account without the bank. That creates utility for BTC.” What does he think of Ethereum? “I like ETH. Obviously it’s a primary foundation for DeFi, and we will see what happens with ETH 2.”  Ah, Eth 2. The Elephant in the Room. If Ethereum 2.0 succeeds, over the next couple of years the blockchain will transition from a proof-of-work consensus model to proof-of-stake and will allow massively more transaction-processing capability. That scalability is needed if Ethereum is to play a meaningful role in the global financial system. But the transition is incredibly difficult to pull off within a large, decentralized community of users where billions of dollars are at stake.  Still, there seems to be early optimism around Eth 2.0. The amount of ether locked and staked on the transitional Beacon Chain has steadily risen to more than 2.8 million ETH as of Wednesday (an amount currently worth about $3.89 billion). Indeed, ether’s steady January gain to an all-time high of $1,476.12 on Sunday was itself an expression of confidence in that project.   There are other ticks in the plus column for Ethereum. There’s a boom in non-fungible tokens, also captured in the Cuban interview. And there’s support, including from suddenly in-the-news social media platform Reddit, for using so-called layer 2 scaling solutions such as Plasma to expand Ethereum’s use cases. Meanwhile, EY blockchain lead Paul Brody is predicting financial institutions will bring DeFi to the masses.  All of this points to an expanding and diversifying Ethereum ecosystem. For a blockchain, that’s the best story you can tell: a growing network.  Did Trump help bitcoin’s late-2020 surge?    Since we’re talking about narratives, let’s look at how we might visually represent a market-justifying story. I’ve chosen a take by CoinDesk Global News Editor Kevin Reynolds on the role played by fears of electoral chaos on bitcoin’s price rise during the late fall and early winter. I can buy this story: If bitcoin is digital gold, it should work as a backstop against dystopia. But what I also found interesting was how easy it was to illustrate this idea on a chart. I just grabbed a few election-related statements by former President Donald Trump and his supporters, got CoinDesk data visualizer Shuai Hao to mark them on a four-month chart from our subsidiary company TradeBlock and the yellow line did the rest.      (NOTE: This chart was produced late Thursday New York time, before bitcoin’s huge leap to a new post-Jan. 8 high of $38,000 early Friday morning. The story may need a new chapter. Arrival of the WSB effect?)      Kevin argues that electoral fear added an extra $10,000 to the all-time high that was hit right after the climactic Jan. 6 raid on Congress. The rest of the gains came from the standard stuff everyone was talking about: mainly that institutional investors were now adding bitcoin to their long-term portfolios. So, when things simmered down and new President Joseph Biden was sworn in, bitcoin’s price eased to what would be fair value in normal times – you know, amid a normal global pandemic and economic depression.    The Conversation: Ants vs. elephants    In 2014, when the idea of decentralized autonomous organizations was first being kicked around, crypto pioneer and DAO enthusiast Joel Dietz founded a decentralized fundraising platform called “Swarm.” (It has since evolved into Swarm Capital, which provides tools for companies to issue security tokens.) The name always struck me as an evocative one for an entity comprising many individuals without centralized control.      Now, after digesting this heady week on Wall Street, the term seems especially apt. I’m talking, of course, about how retail investors in a Subreddit that quickly swelled to 4.4 million people collectively forced big hedge funds into a “short squeeze” on supposedly has-been “meme stocks” such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment and BlackBerry. The WSB group maneuver imposed billions of dollars of losses on those institutions. Melvin Capital needed an injection of $2.75 billion from Citadel and Point72. One thinks of a swarm of ants attacking elephants.      That the name stems from a crypto venture is also fitting since the WSB saga prompted an outpouring of interest from the crypto community. It had all the elements of a crypto drama, even though the battle never occurred on a blockchain.      For one, there was a much-discussed CNBC interview with Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya, who had spent time trawling through the r/WallStreetBets posts and, following the group’s lead, made a $500,000 profit. Declaring that what he “learned over the last couple of days is important for everybody that’s watching CNBC,” Chamath said the insurgent investor movement was “a pushback against the establishment in a very important way,” one that harked back to the 2008 financial crisis. It captured the rebellious, anti-Wall Street vibe that’s long been part of the crypto community.      As the drama unfolded, Crypto Twitter lit up with people drawing parallels with and lessons about the crypto scene.      In a tweet thread about people demanding change to a system rigged for the big guys, Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz said the movement was “a giant endorsement of DeFi.”      Then, on Thursday, when the Redditors’ favored trading app, Robinhood, shut down access to the the stocks in question – creating a vitriolic backlash in what one observer called the trading app’s own “Streisand Effect” – the crypto community leapt to remind the world that this could never happen on a decentralized exchange. It was the perfect opportunity for Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift, to weigh in about his company’s new decentralized offering.      Then, inevitably, the WSB phenomenon spread into the crypto world’s very own “meme token,” Dogecoin, which soared more than 800% to a new record high.      CoinDesk’s own Will Foxley couldn’t resist:    Relevant Reads: Dabbling, not diving    Going into the year-end was an exciting period for bitcoiners. Many large-name investors emerged to declare their appreciation of bitcoin’s potential and the price responded accordingly.      As the price dropped back in the latter part of January, the “institutions are coming” rallying cry tempered. Big-name investors still showed interest in bitcoin, but some of their messages emphasized their caution and focused on the challenges they still see bitcoin facing before it attains a widely recognized place in institutional portfolios. CoinDesk’s coverage this past week captured that. (We’ll have to see how next week’s stories look if bitcoin holds the gains it enjoyed Friday morning and as these institutions take stock of the powerful reckoning they’ve been confronted via a retail investor insurrection.)    Guggenheim Partners Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, who made waves last year when he assigned a long-term target of $400,000 to bitcoin, didn’t exactly retract that prediction but added an implicit “not any time soon” caveat. In a Bloomberg interview he said, “Right now, the reality of the institutional demand that would support a $35,000 price or even a $30,000 price is just not there.” After Friday’s jump, that comment is looking a little off.  Journalists are always looking for comments from Dallas Mavericks owner and CNBC “Shark Tank” personality Marc Cuban. Crypto journalists are no exception. So, we were thrilled that CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser had a rich exchange with Cuban this week. As discussed above, Cuban sees real potential in bitcoin, especially if it can team up with DeFi. But as a standalone investment for now, his current view is, let’s say, “meh.”  We’ve also long been trying to get legendary Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio’s thoughts on bitcoin. He has remained mostly skeptical, even if his tone has become moderately more upbeat over time and his view has emerged only via small snippets of commentary. Finally, in his widely read Daily Observations newsletter, Dalio and his team have delivered a detailed, deep-dive analysis of bitcoin’s opportunities and challenges. I’d say Dalio still has a small amount of learning to do – for example, on why bitcoin can’t easily be replaced by a “better” cryptocurrency – but otherwise this is a brilliant analysis. His team’s assessment of bitcoin’s infamous volatility and why that makes it hard for portfolio managers to adopt it as loss-mitigating uncorrelated asset is masterful. (Oh, and I’m super excited to tell you that Dalio will be a headline keynote at CoinDesk’s Consensus event in May. Stay tuned for more exciting speaker announcements as we update the events page.)  Perhaps the most important news of the week on the institutional investor side was Ian Allison’s scoop that the trustees who run the endowments of Harvard, Yale, Brown and other universities have been investing in bitcoin for over a year. What we need to know is why. The colleges are, for now, keeping the justification for their entry into this market close to their chest. Without that, it’s hard to know whether they’ll keep it up.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Michael J.

42385824,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOUUt,1611931501,"First Mover: Elon Musk #Bitcoin Moment Adds to Dogecoin, GameStop Wackiness","Bitcoin (BTC) which seemed uncannily listless for most of this wild week, suddenly found energy after Elon Musk, the electric-vehicle and private-spaceflight entrepreneur who's also reportedly the world's richest man, changed his Twitter bio to mention the cryptocurrency. (See screen grab below, in Omkar Godbole's Bitcoin Watch column.)      The price of bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, surged 12% to about $37,400, around the highest in two weeks. According to Decrypt, the sudden surge higher caused some $420 million of trader positions to be liquidated – a delicious bit of irony given Musk's very public aversion to short-sellers, or traders who bet on price declines.      Ether (ETH), the Ethereum blockchain's native cryptocurrency, was also higher, pushing back toward a new all-time high price above $1,400.      Dogecoin (DOGE), a digital token with little utility beyond the meme-iness of its doggie-faced image, has climbed eight-fold in the past two days. (Read more about that here and here and in the Market Moves column, below.)      In traditional markets, European share indexes slid and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open amid lingering concerns about a cash squeeze in China and the volatile retail-trader speculation highlighted by this week's GameStop saga.    Market Moves    A new narrative is coursing through digital markets that could soon make its way to the crypto industry's marketing departments: That a lot of individual investors, furious at Wall Street and turned off by stock markets following the GameStop (GME)episode, might find redemption by turning to cryptocurrencies.      Crypto twitterati including Alex Kruger, Balaji Srinivasan, Erik Vorhees and the Winklevoss twins jumped on the bandwagon Thursday, hammering the message that Wall Street serves its own self-interests before those of customers. And that crypto fixes this.      The industry's opportunistic spirit is already appearing in the form of pitches and new products. Non-U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX, famous for last year's TRUMP tokens, rushed to list GameStop's stock for tokenized futures and spot trading, as reported by CoinDesk's Sebastian Sinclair. Bermuda-based Bittrex Global listed tokenized GameStop (GME) shares along with other stocks delisted by the retail trading platform Robinhood, including AMC Entertainment.      Here's a quick sampling of the commentary:    Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, told his newsletter subscribers on Thursday: ""To many involved in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the answer is very clear. Luckily for us, an alternative market has been under construction for the last few years, the decentralized marketplace. It's a place where transparency is enforced by code and not by men.""  Paulo Ardoino, CTO of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and a spokesman for the stablecoin tether: ""As advocates for retail investors rail against the current structure and practices of financial markets, it is important to note that much of the work being done in the blockchain space has been inspired by these barriers. Removing obstacles to normal, everyday working people that are building and seeking wealth growing opportunities has always been part of the ethos of crypto.""  Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM, a blockchain company: ""The case for cryptocurrencies only grows stronger. I believe we will witness a new wave of investors come over to bitcoin and other major crypto assets as a result of this debacle.""  Camila Russo, founder of The Defiant newsletter: ""Decentralized finance will win. It's simply better. Freer.""    One big question, of course, is what it all might mean for cryptocurrency prices. Prices for the digital token dogecoin (DOGE), which is basically just a doggie-faced meme, have shot up in value as rumors swirled that it might be the next to draw the attention of buck-the-system (or even just fun-seeking) retail traders.      As reported by CoinDesk's Kevin Reynolds and Zack Voell, dogecoin's price surged eight-fold Thursday. The token now has a market capitalization of about $6 billion for something that is basically an elaborate joke. Dogecoin has overtaken bitcoin, which has a market value of almost $700 billion, to become the most-mentioned cryptocurrency on Twitter.      (For the DOGE-curious readers out there, the breed typically associated with dogecoin is shiba inu, which, according to the American Kennel Club's website typically only weighs about 20 pounds but is ""a well-muscled,"" ""spirited"" and ""good-natured."" Pretty cute, too!)      As discussed by First Mover on Thursday, there are already a lot of similarities between loosely regulated crypto markets, whose international reach has put large portions of the players and activity beyond the scope of usually-coordinated authorities, and the type of anything-goes, let's-roll spirit that invaded Wall Street this week.      But it's the mere existence of an alternative to the traditional financial system that might ultimately prove to be the biggest selling point for the crypto industry, which can also accurately claim to have the newest technology, broadly speaking.      Mohamed El-Erian, the former Pimco and Harvard money manager who now serves as chief economic adviser for the German financial conglomerate Allianz, wrote this week in a column for Bloomberg Opinion that the GameStop-inspired masses might represent a ""new investor force"" that ""raises several interesting questions for market structure and future financial stability.""      ""The dual possibility of large-scale financial volatility and market dysfunction would pose yet another challenge to an economic recovery,"" El-Erian wrote.      That new investor force might represent the crypto-industry's new hottest new lead – for motivated customers.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin witnessed a sudden double-digit spike to 10-day highs on Friday.      The top cryptocurrency picked up a bid near $32,000 at around 08:30 coordinated universal time (3:30 a.m. in New York) and jumped to $37,050, the highest since Jan. 19, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The 15.7% rise happened in less than 15 minutes and more than reversed the early dip from $34,400 to $32,000.      While the exact reason for the bullish move is hard to define, prices surged after Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio to mention the cryptocurrency. While the bitcoin community is keen for Musk to come out as a supporter, he seemingly enjoys dropping crypto mentions as something of a tease.      Around the time he changed the bio, Musk also cryptically tweeted: ""In retrospect, it was inevitable.""      Whether bitcoin’s rise will continue isn’t certain. Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant’s “Exchange Whale Ratio,” calculated by dividing the top 10 bitcoin inflow transactions in an hour by total exchange inflows, jumped to an eight-month high of 0.88 early Friday, warning of a possible price drop.

42385826,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOUTd,1611927169,Elon Musk-Prompted Bitcoin Price Surge Causes Liquidation of $387M in Shorts,"For Elon Musk, whose hatred for short-sellers blazes hot enough to reforge Mjölnir a dozen times over, the millions in losses suffered by shorts after the Tesla CEO changed his Twitter bio to ""Bitcoin"" must make it feel like Christmas and his birthday rolled into one.      That one word bio caused the price of bitcoin to spike to a 10-day high of $38,020 and sparked $387 million worth of short liquidations on major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, BitMEX, ByBit, Deribit, FTX, HuobiDM and OKEx.      The crypto market leader is trading at $37,390 at press time, representing a more than 15% gain from the low of $32,000 seen during the European morning session.      Today's short liquidation is the largest since Jan. 2, when exchanges closed $575 million worth of shorts, according to data provider Coinalyze.      Forced closure of short positions happens when the price moves above a predetermined threshold, signaling the liquidation engine to ""square off,"" or close, the positions. A massive short squeeze like this often puts upward pressure on prices, leading to a bullish move.    Market was skewed bearish    Data indicates the market was skewed bearish early Monday and some observers were anticipating a price drop, courtesy of increased inflows onto exchanges.      However, sentiment turned bullish after Musk changed his Twitter bio and tweeted: ""In retrospect, it was inevitable."" The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who has made no secret of his loathing for short-sellers, may not haven intended to have caused the liquidations, but may have popped the cork on a bottle of champagne after viewing the carnage his bio change wrought.      To document Elon's ostensible nod to the leading cryptocurrency, F2Pool, currently the largest mining pool by hashrate, embedded the tech mogul's latest tweet in Bitcoin block 668,197.      Google searches for ""bitcoin,"" a barometer of widespread interest, surged following Musk's cryptic endorsement of bitcoin. It remains to be seen if increased interest translates into more buying and stronger price gains.      ""I assume the U.S. session will try to follow in lock-step of digesting the news,"" Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk. ""Typically speaking, such things would be met with more muted response. But given the backdrop, I think it could be ripe for a follow-through.""      So bitcoin is looking north, having pierced a two-week bearish trendline on the daily chart. Resistance is seen at $40,112 (Jan. 14 high), followed by the psychological level of $42,000.

""This new data demonstrates an increasingly diverse base engaging with crypto and indicates how the market is likely to evolve over the longer term,"" said Blair Halliday, head of U.K. at Gemini.  Conducted in early Q4 2020, Gemini's research represented ""a nationally representative survey of 2,000 U.K. respondents,"" per the report.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the largest portion of British cryptocurrency investors, 21.9%, are from Greater London, followed by 14.6% from the West Midlands region.  Reflecting the results of other studies, cryptocurrency investors age 18-24 made up 27.5% of the group, while those age 25-34 dominated at 33.1%. Around 24% were age 35-44.  Over half (57%) who expressed no interest in crypto investing were over 55.

The top cryptocurrency picked up a bid near $32,000 at around 08:30 UTC and jumped to $37,050, the highest level since Jan. 19, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The 15.7% rise happened in less than 15 minutes and more than reversed the early dip from $34,400 to $32,000.      While the exact reason for the bullish move is hard to define, prices surged after Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio to mention the cryptocurrency. While the bitcoin community is keen for Musk to come out as a supporter, he seemingly enjoys dropping crypto mentions as something of a tease.      Around the time he changed the bio, Musk also cryptically tweeted:      Whether bitcoin's rise will continue isn't certain. Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant's ""Exchange Whale Ratio,"" calculated by dividing the top 10 bitcoin inflow transactions in an hour by total exchange inflows, jumped to an eight-month high of 0.88 early Friday, warning of a possible price drop.      However, ""Elon's tweet overrides all other bearish signals,"" Ki-Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant tweeted.      Documenting Musk's ostensible nod to the leading cryptocurrency, F2Pool, currently the largest mining pool by hashrate, embedded the tech mogul's latest tweet in Bitcoin block 668,197. ""We wanted to do something special for the bitcoin community,"" a spokesperson from the mining pool told CoinDesk after mining the block.      Other bitcoin users planted the tweet on the blockchain too, like Zakk Lakin, technical lead at bitcoin exchange CoinCorner, who planted Musk's tweet in a single bitcoin transaction on Friday.      Reflecting Musk's huge social media influence, Google searches for ""bitcoin"" surged following his bio change.      The latest price rise marks an upward break of the recent $30,000 to $35,000 trading range. As such, more chart-driven buying may be seen. The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $36,100.

In a video interview on Thursday with Bloomberg's Emily Chang, Vlad Tenev said the rumors were ""categorically false"" and Robinhood wasn't ""directed by a market maker or any other market participant,"" but rather the decision was based on a ""technical and operational"" one.      ""Robinhood, as a brokerage, has financial requirements including ... deposits that we have to make to various clearinghouses. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets,"" said Tenev.      In order to ""protect the firm"" and Robinhood's customer base, Tenev said his platform disabled purchasing of 13 stocks associated with a Reddit trading group called WallStreetBets (WSB). Tenev added that buy orders for the 13 securities could resume as early as tomorrow.      The current flurry of trader activity has represented an ""unprecedented market environment"" over the past couple of weeks, according to the CEO. He said Robinhood had not disable selling of the stocks as it would have been ""painful"" to users of the platform if they weren't allowed to exit their positions.      Share prices for businesses such as Nokia (NOK), AMC Entertainment (AMC) and GameStop (GME) rose to astronomical highs in recent weeks when WSB sought to ""short squeeze"" large U.S. institutional hedge funds looking to bet against those companies.      A number of retail traders have since exited their positions amid calls to hold with ""diamond hands"" – referring to a mindset of maintaining positions in an attempt to drive up stock prices. Despite the calls, AMC, GME and NOK's share prices have fallen back over the last 24-hours, while lawsuits were filed against Robinhood.      ""Concentrated investing"" around these types of stocks was in high demand because of an ""intersection"" of social media and finance, the CEO said.      ""I can kind of understand how Clorox and Lysol were feeling at the beginning of the dynamic when there was so much demand,"" said Tenev referring to cleaning products indirectly touted by Donald Trump as a potential medical treatment to combat the rise of COVID-19.      When pressed by Chang over whether Tenev would be willing to visit Washington D.C. to testify about its actions, the CEO said he was open to having a conversation and that the current developments presented an ""opportunity"" to educate the public regarding how the mechanics of financial settlements in the market work.
