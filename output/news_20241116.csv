36421515,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653431,1731796226,"Bitcoin Surges Past $93,000 – Can A Breakthrough Unlock New Heights?","Bitcoin is on the move again, surging toward its previous high of $93,257 with renewed momentum that has triggered excitement among traders. After a period of consolidation, Bitcoin’s latest price action signals a potential breakout that could set the stage for even greater gains. As it inches closer to this critical resistance level, can the crypto giant break through and unlock new heights, or will the bears reclaim control? With the market’s eyes fixed on this pivotal moment, the next move could reshape BTC’s future. This analysis aims to explore Bitcoin’s current surge toward the $93,257 resistance level and assess the likelihood of a breakout. By examining key technical indicators and market trends, it seeks to determine whether BTC can overcome this significant hurdle and reach new highs. Additionally, it will explore the possible impact of such a breakthrough on its price trajectory and the broader market sentiment. Bitcoin’s Renewed Momentum Leading To $93,257 Bitcoin is currently maintaining a bullish stance, holding firmly above the 100-day SMA on the 4-hour chart, a strong indicator of continued upward momentum. The price now aims for its previous high of $93,257, having successfully avoided a drop below the $85,211 support. If this pressure continues, a break above $93,257 could create a path for new highs, while holding above the $85,211 support level signals strength in the ongoing rally. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a continued upside movement as the RSI climbs to 61% after dipping to 53%, signaling that the market is maintaining its bullish strength. Significantly, the sustained rise in the RSI suggests that the uptrend is gaining traction with the potential for more price increases as the buying pressure builds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Gains 10%: Is The $100K Dream Closer Than Ever? Additionally, the daily chart reveals that BTC is experiencing strong upbeat momentum, highlighted by the formation of bullish candlesticks. The asset’s position well above the key 100-day SMA further reinforces this positive trend. As BTC maintains its current trajectory, it bolsters market optimism, setting the stage for additional gains as it aims for the $93,257 target. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is at 92%, indicating strong positive movement after recovering from a dip to 77% suggesting a shift in market sentiment with increased buying pressure. While the high RSI points to continued growth, prolonged overbought conditions may lead to a correction if buying activity begins to wane. Key Resistance: Can Bitcoin Push Through? Bitcoin is approaching a critical resistance level at $93,257, a price point that could determine the next phase of its bullish trajectory. If Bitcoin successfully surpasses $93,257, it could pave the way for new highs, indicating continued strength in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Enters ‘Second Breakout Of The Cycle,’ Analyst Puts Peak Above $150,000 However, if the resistance holds, Bitcoin could experience a pullback or consolidation, with the price retracing toward the $83,211 support level. A break below this support could indicate more declines, with the possibility of testing additional key support zones.

36417894,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653400,1731790826,XRP Primed For $100 Price Target – Here’s Why,"According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP rose by 15.57% in the past day to cap off what has been an impressive price performance over the last week. Amidst Bitcoin’s journey to the $90,000 price zone, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency emerged as one of the biggest weekly gainers with a 60.76% price increase. Following this price surge, a crypto analyst with X username BarriC has provided some interesting predictions on XRP’s future. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Booms: $44 Million In Transactions As Activity Soars XRP To Reach $10 In Bull Market, But There’s More In an X post on November 15, BarriC released several price targets for XRP tied to certain conditions. Firstly, the analyst forecasted XRP to attain a market price between $6-$10 in the crypto bull run, representing a minimum potential 500% gain on the token’s present price. These high expectations by BarriC are rather not uncommon due to several factors especially Donald Trump’s recent electoral victory which is expected to usher in a crypto-friendly US government. For XRP, the Republican President sticking to his electoral crypto manifesto holds massive importance as it may bring a decisive end to the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, and permanently halt the regulatory uncertainty over the token. In addition, Trump’s presidency also boosts the possibility of the XRP spot ETF with the SEC expected to present fewer regulatory hurdles for crypto-linked securities. Following approval, BarriC postulates a spot ETF can drive the altcoin to a market price of $15-$20 if approval comes amidst the bull market run. Furthermore, the analyst discusses a utility run during which the altcoin will undergo massive adoption in its use for cross-border transactions and as an institutional bridge cryptocurrency for banks. If the utility run occurs as predicted with global adoption levels of XRP, BarriC forecasts the altcoin to attain a minimal price of $100.

The coin rose from around $0.69 to reach a local peak of $0.92 as Gary Gensler “supposedly” hinted at a resignation as SEC chairman. While the altcoin has recorded a slight price decline of 1.2% in the past hour, the massive purchase by whales indicates a belief in the asset for long-term profitability. At the time of writing.

As the market rides the bull wave spearheaded by Bitcoin, a crypto analyst has identified the current phase of the market using the Wyckoff Cycle. This analysis suggests that altcoins are preparing for a “parabolic run” that could kickstart the onset of the altcoin season. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $800K? Galaxy Digital CEO Unveils Bold 5-10 Year Forecast Wyckoff Cycle Reveals What Phase The Current Market Has Entered A crypto technical analyst identified as EtherNasyonal has shared a chart of the crypto total market cap, excluding Bitcoin. In this chart, the Wyckoff cycle, a widely used framework for understanding market behavior and trends, can be seen. The chart showed four distinct market phases — Accumulation, Mark up, Distribution, and Mark down. The accumulation phase is the period when smart money begins buying assets at lower prices, and prices consolidate as selling pressure reduces. Once the accumulation phase completes, the Markup phase begins, where prices break out of the consolidation range and begin an uptrend driven by increased demand. The next phase, the Distribution stage, is characterized by selling pressure, where smart money begins selling its holdings, leading to price corrections or stabilization. After this stage, the Markdown phase starts, where selling pressure overwhelms demand, triggering a downtrend. Based on these unique phases, the crypto analyst has revealed that the market is currently in the Mark up phase, highlighted by an increase in the prices of various cryptocurrencies. By 2025, 2026, and 2027, the total market is expected to enter a re-accumulation phase, another mark up phase, and a distribution phase, respectively. The right side of the chart also shows a continuation of these distinct market phases, with 2027 to 2030 set to witness an accumulation, mark up, and distribution stage. Here’s When The Altcoin Season Could Begin Based on EtherNasyonal’s Wyckoff cycle chart, the altcoin season is set to commence, with altcoins already preparing to experience a parabolic run. The altcoin season is a period when cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, experience significant price increases and often outperform Bitcoin significantly. Based on the past bull market, the altcoins that led the previous altcoin season include Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, and others. The crypto analyst has revealed that the altcoin season will begin after the reaccumulation phase in the Wyckoff crypto market chart. The reaccumulation phase is set to take place in 2025, following the Mark up phase in 2024. Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor In this reaccumulation phase, the analyst expects altcoins to experience an epic rise that could lead to a strong and bullish altcoin season. The Bitcoin price performance is also set to influence this anticipated altcoin season, as a Bitcoin bull run has historically preceded past altcoin seasons. Moreover, as the market sees a decrease in Bitcoin’s dominance and increased demand for altcoins, this could signal that the altcoin season may be imminent.

42415526,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJifr,1731783225,An Interview With El Salvador’s Top Crypto Regulator: ‘Developing Countries Can Lead the Financial Revolution’,"Juan Carlos Reyes, the CNAD’s president, sat down with CoinDesk for an exclusive interview.  Crypto regulators need to deeply understand the technology before offering regulatory frameworks, Reyes said.  Tokenization efforts are particularly attractive as they allow the democratization of access to structured securities.  When it comes to regulating crypto, El Salvador has a head-start on most other countries. It was the first nation to adopt bitcoin {{BTC}} as legal tender, in 2021, and has become home to a wide range of crypto companies.  “Looking at the big picture, most people won't understand what we're doing in El Salvador, they only see glimpses,” Juan Carlos Reyes, president of the National Commission of Digital Assets in El Salvador (CNAD) — which was created in February 2023 to regulate the crypto sector in the Latin American nation of 6.3 million souls — told CoinDesk in an interview.  “Even the foreign companies that are regulated here but don’t have a full office on-the-ground, they don't understand how advanced we already are, and how quickly things are advancing in this industry.”  President Nayib Bukele’s initiative forced the nation’s agencies to grapple with the technology and the implications of working with a digital currency, Reyes said.  Consequently, El Salvador avoided giving crypto supervisory and regulatory authority to its traditional financial regulators — like, for example, the Superintendence of the Financial System (SFS) — and instead created the CNAD from scratch. The objective was to create a tailor-made regulatory framework to crypto instead of trying to bend existing rules to digital assets.  “There’s an old saying in English: ‘If it sounds like a duck, it looks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck,’” Reyes said. “Well, in this case, it's not a duck. Digital assets are not like traditional financial instruments at all.”  That’s why the CNAD took a technology-minded approach to regulating crypto as soon as Reyes — a computer science heavyweight — became the agency’s leader in September 2023. The results have been shocking, according to crypto companies that received El Salvador’s Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) license.  “We were completely caught off-guard by how knowledgeable, how detailed, how completely versed in not just regulations, but the technology [the CNAD was],” Nick Cowan, Group CEO of tokenization solutions firm VLRM, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Without trying to over-praise El Salvador, we were completely stunned by how quickly they were able to get to the heart of the matter to review our application.”  Victor Solomon, partner at Salvador-based tokenization advisory firm Tokenization Expert, concurred.  “We didn’t have to spend time explaining the technical foundations of our operations — [Reyes] already understood the intricacies of tokenization and the compliance measures we had in place,” Solomon told CoinDesk.  “He understands the practical challenges [that] businesses face, from fundraising to navigating regulations, and this makes him not just a regulator but an advocate for businesses that aim to positively impact the Salvadoran economy,” Solomon added.  The Technologist  Born in El Salvador, Reyes moved to Canada as a child to escape the war that was, at the time, ravaging the country. A self-described “very high achievement person,” he has multiple bachelor’s degrees — computer science, math and physics — as well as a master’s degree in management from Harvard. He began a doctorate in philosophy from the People’s Friendship University of Russia but was unable to complete it because of COVID and the war in Ukraine.  His professional background is just as varied. His experience ranges from leading a consulting firm for 15 years to developing business opportunities for the Missanabie Cree First Nation to opening a bar on the second floor of his beach house. A Bitcoin believer since 2013, he decided to move back to El Salvador in 2021 to take part in the cryptocurrency nationalization process.  The CNAD, which counts 35 employees, is fully independent, and modeled after Reyes’ image: everyone knows crypto (and the underlying technology) like the back of their hand. In fact, 20 members of the staff are currently enrolled in a post-graduate crypto program at the University of CEMA in Argentina to buff up their expertise.  “We have the most educated, most complete team when it comes to regulation of crypto assets in the world,” Reyes said. “If anyone doesn't know how to do a transaction on Bitcoin, including my driver, they probably cannot work here.”  This crack team certainly leaves a strong impression on the companies that seek to obtain a license to operate in El Salvador.  Reyes “is a technologist,” Cowan, whose company has worked with dozens of other regulators over the globe, told CoinDesk. “He absolutely gets the tech. In other jurisdictions, you have regulators who understand the regulations and investor protection, which, of course, is critical, but they don't necessarily understand the technology, and that can sometimes make it quite onerous to get to the point that you need to get to.”  “It was a very detailed and complex process. I mean, we submitted a 700-page application,” Cowan said. “But the decision-making process was a lot faster [than in other countries] after the application had been filed… It was incredibly thorough, I would say, as equal as any other regulatory process we've had to undergo before. It wasn't easier, just quicker.”  For Reyes, the crypto-literacy of the agency means that it can abide by one of the space’s most valued philosophical tenets — don’t trust, verify — and go examine the blockchain each time they interact with a new company seeking a license. The team doesn’t rely on the documents provided by compliance officers, and that has already led to firms getting caught giving wrong information to the regulator.  El Salvador’s advantage  Reyes likes to use an analogy to explain why crypto needs its own regulator. If you buy an electric car and it breaks down, and you bring it to your mechanic of 20 years, well, when he pops the hood open, he won’t find an engine — just a battery. And he won’t know what to do with it.  That’s what crypto and traditional financial assets are like to Reyes. They look similar on a surface level. But dig a little deeper, and it’s a different beast entirely. It’s one of the reasons why jurisdictions around the globe have been slow to implement regulatory frameworks for digital assets.  El Salvador, however, is a small country. With a GDP of $35 billion, its economy is 17th among Latin American nations and 103rd in the world. It doesn’t have its own currency, nor does it boast of strong financial institutions, or even of an existing ecosystem of developers. But Reyes says all of these things turned out to be boons when it comes to regulating crypto, because El Salvador started “with a blank sheet of paper.”  To fall back on the electric car analogy, it’s as if El Salvador was able to specialize right away in fixing batteries and motors, instead of having to convert its existing infrastructure — designed for engines and pistons — into the kind of garage that can repair a Tesla.  “In other countries, a lot of these new technologies are created by innocent people trying to bring the crypto ecosystem forward, but they don’t always think about how the tech can be perverted and used as a money laundering tool,” Reyes said. “It’s hard for regulators to know how loosely to regulate.”  “We were able to make the CNAD the single point of entry for all digital assets in the country,” Reyes said. “Anyone that isn’t licensed by the commission is breaking the law.”  There’s also the fact that the financial institutions in Western countries have more to lose by a change of the status-quo than some Latin American nations. “They have lobbyists. They've been fighting it. They implemented Operation Chokepoint 2.0. They've done everything to ensure that this industry doesn't thrive,” Reyes, who once had a Canadian bank account frozen because of his crypto activities, said. Countries like El Salvador have everything to gain in moving fast and seizing the opportunities presented by crypto.  How to Regulate Crypto  But what kind of regulatory environment does El Salvador want to nurture?  Reyes said that in terms of financial instruments, Bitcoin was “more than enough,” but that otherwise the CNAD is technology agnostic. Most of the companies regulated by the agency run on Ethereum. The size of the regulated firms varies: there are global heavyweights like Tether and Bitfinex Securities, but also Salvadoran companies “that started with, you know, $2,000,” according to Reyes.  Consumer security and financial security are at the top of the priority list. That means, for example, requiring exchanges to use multi-signature wallets to ensure that another FTX cannot happen, or for a firm’s private blockchain to follow certain security standards. The identification of each and every customer is also mandatory.  “You have to remember that we had gangs terrorize our country for multiple years,” Reyes said. “So we take financial transparency and money laundering and financial terrorism very seriously, and those have been strongly embedded into a regulation.” In his view, if a crypto company is regulated in El Salvador, it can obtain a license anywhere in the world.  There’s one sector Reyes is particularly enthusiastic about: real-world assets. Efforts like VLRM’s and Tokenization Expert’s will, in his view, expand the range of investment opportunities for retail investors. “Before Robinhood existed, most young people in the U.S. could never have bought Tesla or Nvidia [stocks],” Reyes said. “Robinhood democratized access to all these different stocks that were only available to the super elite. This is exactly what tokenization does.” The expectation is that in the coming years Salvadorans will get exposure to regulated products unavailable in other jurisdictions.  “For the first time in modern history, developing countries can lead the financial revolution, rather than being left behind and just picking up the scraps,” Reyes said. “We're trying to encourage other nations to look at El Salvador and learn how they can adapt our model to their countries.”  CORRECTION (Nov. 18, 2024, 14:39 UTC): A previous version of this story stated that Reyes fled El Salvador as a child because of gang warfare, not the Salvadoran civil war. Additionally, the article was amended to reflect that Reyes did not finish his doctorate in philosophy in Russia.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/16/an-interview-with-el-salvadors-top-crypto-regulator-developing-countries-can-lead-the-financial-revolution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ccb773b6fd35d7adf4faade19d83ce386595b847-3059x1721.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36410906,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653394,1731780058,"Bitcoin Price Could Soon Break $100,000, Blockchain Firm Explains How","The Bitcoin price continued its red-hot form over the past week, printing successive all-time highs in less than five days. While Donald Trump’s success at the United States elections might have kickstarted the recent rally, the growth of the premier cryptocurrency — and the general crypto market — seems to have developed a life of its own. Interestingly, the market has been left wondering where the next market top is, with some pundits and commentators believing that the BTC price rally has come to an end. However, a prominent on-chain analytics firm has come forward to say that the Bitcoin price still has room for some upside movement. Four Reasons Why $100,000 Is Possible For Bitcoin Price: CryptoQuant In its latest weekly report, CryptoQuant revealed that Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is yet to be overvalued despite its recent positive momentum. According to the blockchain platform, the market leader could soon reach the highly-coveted price level of $100,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Explodes 112% – Is $1 The New Target After This Historic Rally? The rationale behind this projection is based on valuable metrics, such as the MVRV (market value to realized value) ratio. As the name suggests, this indicator measures the ratio between the market value and the realized value of a cryptocurrency. As such, the MVRV helps to assess the tops and bottoms of the Bitcoin market. CryptoQuant noted that Bitcoin is not yet overvalued at the current price levels, as the MVRV metric is still outside the overvalued region. This ultimately means that the bullish price action is not overheated, and the Bitcoin price could still make a play for higher prices. What’s more, the Trader On-chain Realized max band is pointing to $100,000 as the next target for the Bitcoin price. According to CryptoQuant, the last time the max band reached its current level was in March 2024 when the premier cryptocurrency surpassed the $70,000 level for the first time. Another on-chain observation that supports the continuous Bitcoin price rally is the demand growth. CryptoQuant highlighted that investor demand in the United States has returned since the presidential election, with Coinbase Premium remaining positive in the past few days. Finally, crypto market liquidity has continued to increase over the past few weeks, as stablecoins make their onto exchanges. For context, more than $3.2 billion in USDT has flowed into exchanges since the US election, signaling the potential of a sustained Bitcoin price rally. Tread With Caution However, CryptoQuant sounded a warning in its report, saying that some selling action could follow the recent price rally. While some Bitcoin miners have started offloading their assets for profit, the blockchain firm also noted that the Bitcoin selling seen so far is still insignificant but could rise quickly soon.

42415518,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJiZZ,1731778163,XRP Price Skyrockets Past $1 as SEC Faces Legal Troubles And Favorable Regulatory Shift Looms,"XRP's price has nearly doubled this week to above $1.  The SEC's legal troubles could have a bearing on the agency's pending appeal in the Ripple ruling, which said that XRP sales on public exchanges did not fall under the definition of a security.  The price surge is consistent with the recent bullish positioning in the options market.  XRP surged past the $1 mark Saturday, hitting a three-year high amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's mounting legal troubles.  The payments-focused cryptocurrency surged over 27%, reaching a high of $1.27 at one point, a level last seen in November 2021, CoinDesk data show. Prices have nearly doubled this week, boosting the market capitalization to $63.59 billion.  On Thursday, a group of state attorneys general and the DeFi Education Fund sued the SEC, alleging unconstitutional overreach, accusing the regulator of overstepping the boundaries in bringing enforcement actions against digital asset exchanges.  The lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky said the SEC has unilaterally asserted regulatory authority over cryptocurrencies, classifying them as investment contracts like stocks and bonds. It added that digital assets are just assets and not investment contracts and the SEC's approach encroaches upon states' rights to police the industry on their own.  The lawsuit could have far-reaching implications, especially on the SEC's pending appeal in the Ripple case, which is one of the biggest factors impacting XRP's price.  In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, accusing the company of conducting an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP, which the SEC classified as a security. In July of last year, a U.S. court ruled that Ripple's XRP sales to institutional investors qualified as securities transactions. However, it also determined that sales of XRP on public exchanges did not fall under the definition of a security. In October, the SEC appealed against this ruling, seeking further clarification on the legal status of XRP.  Founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said that XRP's surge stems from expectations for friendlier regulation under President-elect Donald Trump's administration.  ""XRP is a key beneficiary of a more friendly administration under Trump and particular from a likely outgoing of [SEC chief] Gary Gensler who has had Ripple Labs tied up in legal battles which could disappear along with his departure,"" founders told CoinDesk.  ""There's even speculation of a potential meeting between Ripple CEO and Trump reinforcing the sense that the regulatory environment is set to be significantly more favorable to companies and tokens, such as Ripple,"" the founders added.  Note that the price surge above $1 is consistent with the bullish positioning in the options market early this week. Besides, it's accompanied by a surge in futures open interest to a record high of $1.53 billion, according to data source Coinalyze. An uptick in open interest alongside a price rally is said to validate the uptrend.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/16/xrp-skyrockets-past-1-as-sec-faces-legal-troubles-and-favorable-regulatory-shift-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91f2b0cea6271c71b8ef4af97daa3b8dca76c2f0-2880x1800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an interview, he highlighted how pro-business policies could transform the market, particularly under a second Trump presidency. Garlinghouse stated that U.S. crypto assets, including Ripple’s XRP , have seen significant growth since the election, attributing this to improved investor confidence and potential regulatory changes. He claimed that the industry has unlocked vast value in recent weeks, pointing to surges in several U.S.-based crypto technologies as evidence. He argued that a friendlier regulatory environment could lead to even greater gains. He emphasized that many American crypto assets have performed exceptionally well, highlighting recent moves by platforms like Robinhood to list U.S.-based cryptocurrencies such as Ripple and Cardano. These listings, along with the success of other projects like Solana, underscore the potential for domestic innovation in crypto. Garlinghouse noted that U.S. markets are preparing for major changes, fueled by expectations of more supportive policies. During the interview, he welcomed legal challenges to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), particularly a recent lawsuit involving 18 states, and commented on the potential retirement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Garlinghouse described this as an opportunity for the industry to move past what he referred to as a “war on crypto.” Looking forward, Garlinghouse predicts a transformative period for the sector, driven by reduced regulatory hostility and pro-crypto leadership. He believes these changes could unlock further innovation and value, cementing the U.S. as a global leader in the crypto industry. In his closing remarks, Garlinghouse expressed surprise that these changes hadn’t occurred sooner but acknowledged their importance in driving the industry forward.

Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor According to reports, investors who initially claimed that Musk manipulated Dogecoin’s price have withdrawn their complaint. Also, the group is withdrawing its bid to sanction Musk’s lawyers for supposedly interfering with the appeal, including canceling a request to cover their legal fees. The lawsuit alleged that Tesla and Musk influenced Dogecoin’s price through social media posts and public statements. They highlighted Musk’s appearance on Saturday Night Live in 2021, arguing that the Tesla owner made remarks influencing the token’s price, allowing him to profit from these price swings. Elon Musk Public Statements And Stunts ‘Influenced Dogecoin Price’ Investors filed a case against Musk in response to his statements and posts that supposedly influenced the Dogecoin price. The lawsuit highlighted Musk’s presence in NBC’s Saturday Night Live in 2021, where he shared his views on Dogecoin, pushing the token’s price to increase. According to the complainants, Musk manipulated the market to his benefit. They claimed that Musk manipulated the market through postings on Twitter/X, adding the tag “Dogecoin CEO” and using the DOGE symbol as part of his bio. The group alleged that the token’s price surged after Musk commented, including a statement that Tesla will accept Dogecoin as a payment method. The complainants were seeking damages of $258 billion from Elon Musk. Court Dismisses Case Against Tesla CEO The court has already dismissed the case against Tesla and Musk last August. In dismissing the case, US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein argued that the complainants cannot prove securities solely based on Musk’s post on social media. The judge added that Musk’s statement, saying that Dogecoin is the world’s future currency, can be used to buy Tesla, and can “fly to the moon, are considered “aspirational and puffery” and not necessarily factual. In short, Judge Hellerstein explained that no reasonable person should rely on posts to complain about securities fraud. The judge further noted that it would be challenging to show and prove insider trading and market manipulation claims based on posts alone. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $800K? Galaxy Digital CEO Unveils Bold 5-10 Year Forecast Musk And Tesla Officially Withdraw Their Motion Immediately after receiving the fraud and market manipulation complaint, Musk’s team motioned to sanction the group’s lawyers for filing a “frivolous case.” Musk called out the legal team for their ever-changing arguments to extort money. Last Thursday, both sides filed stipulations to dismiss the appeal in a Manhattan court. These requests require Judge Hellerstein’s approval, and upon signature, the cases are officially dismissed.

36403801,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653397,1731769203,Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Signals ‘Local Bottom’ — What’s Next?,"According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross has fallen into a crucial region. What could this mean for the price of the premier cryptocurrency? What Does The Falling NVT Golden Cross Mean For Price? In a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Burakkesmeci revealed that the price of Bitcoin might have reached a “local bottom.” This exciting prognosis is based on the latest movement by the “NVT Golden Cross” metric. For context, the “Network Value to Transactions” ratio is an on-chain indicator that estimates the difference between the Bitcoin market capitalization and transaction volume. Typically, a high NVT value signals that an asset’s price is high compared to the network’s transaction volume, suggesting that the coin is overvalued. Related Reading: BNB Price Poised for Takeoff: Will It Be The Next to Rally? Conversely, when the value of the NVT metric is low, it implies that the coin’s market value is small relative to the transaction volume. Usually, this indicates that the asset is undervalued and its price could still have room for upside movement. Now, the Golden Cross indicator is a modified iteration of the NVT ratio, and it helps to mark gradual buy and sell zones in short-term trends. According to Burakkesmeci explained that when the NVT GC exceeds 2.2 (the red zone), it means that the price in a short-term trend is overheating (and the formation of a potential local top). On the other hand, the NVT Golden Cross dipping below -1.6 suggests that the price decline is wearing out, signaling a potential bottom. Burakkesmeci noted that these local tops and bottoms are regions rather than just precise levels. As shown in the chart above, the NVT Golden Cross has crossed beneath -1.6 and is currently around -3.3, suggesting that the Bitcoin price is at a local bottom. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, this could represent a “gradual buying opportunity” for investors looking to get into the market. Bitcoin Market In Extreme Greed Investors will want to proceed with caution especially as the Bitcoin market seems to be overheating in the long term. According to another CryptoQuant analyst, the Fear & Greed Index has flagged extreme greed for the premier cryptocurrency. Typically, when the Fear & Greed Index moves toward one end, there is a potential for market reversal depending on the sentiment. In this case, where the market is in extreme greed, the Bitcoin price may be about to witness a correction.

36400335,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653378,1731763858,"As Bitcoin Rises, Why is Ethereum Struggling To Catch Up? Analyst Explains","While Bitcoin has faced strong bullish momentum in recent weeks, achieving new all-time highs consistently for days, Ethereum has been an underperformer, unable to catch up with BTC’s bullish pace. Even compared to other crypto assets (altcoins) in the market, Ethereum has failed to make a major rally that melts faces. Instead, as Bitcoin achieved a peak above $93,000, leading the overall crypto market in a bullish market, Ethereum has only been able to surge to just $3,396 over the same period BTC broke multiple resistances to achieve consistent new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price at $3,000: Can Support Prevent Further Losses? So far, ETH remains roughly a 37.5% decrease away from its all-time high of $4,878, seen 3 years ago in November 2021. At the time of writing, the asset faces a correction alongside the rest of the crypto market, including Bitcoin. ETH has declined by 2.3% in the past day, currently trading at $3,023. Why is Ethereum Struggling to Catch Up? The underperformance of Ethereum relative to Bitcoin has caught the attention of market analysts. One key observation comes from a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost, who provided a possible explanation for Ethereum’s price stagnation. According to Darkfost, the taker buy-sell ratio is a crucial metric to consider, particularly on the Binance exchange. This ratio is an indicator of short-term market sentiment, and when it remains below 1, it suggests there is more selling pressure than buying interest. It can also indicate a hesitation among traders to accumulate ETH at current levels, which could contribute to a lagging price performance. Darkfost noted: The taker buy-sell ratio on Binance remains bearish, as it has been below 1 most of the time over the past month. This indicates that traders are more willing to sell than buy ETH, which could explain why ETH is currently underperforming compared to BTC. Is There Still Hope For ETH? Despite Ethereum’s struggle to match Bitcoin’s gains, some analysts remain optimistic about the long-term potential of ETH. For example, a well-known crypto analyst, Kingpin Crypto, expressed a bullish sentiment regarding ETH at its current price levels. In a recent post on X, Kingpin Crypto suggested that ETH trading around the $3,000 mark presents a notable buying opportunity. $ETH – Buy with conviction around the orange line and retire. I know the BTC pair is underwhelming and feels like it will be down only forever. However, I am telling you… Ethereum will make a NEW ATH this cycle. pic.twitter.com/T2r2TDmkb7 — Kingpin Crypto (@Kingpincrypto12) November 15, 2024 Similarly, another crypto analyst, Yoddha, shared an analysis indicating a potentially bullish pattern for Ethereum. According to the chart shared by Yoddha, ETH’s historical price movements often include a phase of retesting followed by a sharp surge in value. Yoddha highlighted that Ethereum may have already completed its retest phase, suggesting that a strong price rally could be on the horizon.

Dogecoin Whales Have Just Added 140 Million DOGE To Their Wallets As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Dogecoin whales have continued their buying push during the last 24 hours. The indicator of interest here is the “Supply Distribution” from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which keeps track of the total amount of DOGE that a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins group, for instance, contains all investors who own between 1 and 10 DOGE. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Is Finally Back: These Metrics Point To An Explosion In Interest In the context of the current topic, the 10 million to 100 million coins group is of focus. At the current exchange rate, the lower end of this range converts to about $3.7 million, while the upper one to $37 million. These are clearly significant amounts, so the only investors who would qualify for this cohort would be the big-money ones. The group certainly doesn’t include all holders of this kind as the upper limit is ‘just’ $37 million, but it does the contain smaller of the whales, who are still an important part of the DOGE ecosystem. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution specifically for this Dogecoin group over the past few weeks: From the above graph, it’s visible that the Dogecoin supply held by these whales has been riding an uptrend recently, with a particularly sharp increase coming during the past few days, coinciding with DOGE’s massive rally. Considering this timing, it’s likely that these investors have been helping support the run. In the last 24 hours, the memecoin has seen a reversal in direction, with its price suffering a pullback of around 7% as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has registered a red day. Interestingly, despite the decline, the Supply Distribution for the 10 million to 100 million coins group has continued to head up. In total, these humongous investors have added a net 140 million DOGE to their holdings, worth almost $52 million at the moment. This accumulation naturally suggests that the whales don’t think that the rally is over just yet. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Co. Take Over Social Media: Why Memecoin Frenzy Is Bad For Bitcoin It only remains to be seen, though, whether the positive sentiment from these large investors can induce a fresh surge in Dogecoin, or if their bet would fail this time around.

Trump's victory has fuelled optimism in the crypto market, leading to significant gains in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins. If Trump delivers his promises, Bitcoin could further stretch gains to $100,000 or even $110,000, making it a multi-trillion dollar asset. Risks include potential profit-taking and the possibility that Trump's promises were mere campaign tactics, which could lead to a significant pullback in Bitcoin's price. On Wednesday, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) spiked to hit a new all-time high of $93,409 mainly driven by President-elect Trump’s victory on November 4. The crypto community is buoyed by what Trump promised during his re-election campaign rather than anything he’s already delivered to the industry. Trump's win has been good for crypto During the Bitcoin event in Nashville, Trump promised that if elected, he would fire the Securities and Exchange Commission chair, Gary Gensler. Gensler's tenure has seen the SEC charge several cryptocurrency companies, including Binance, Coinbase ( COIN ), Robinhood’s ( HOOD ) crypto unit, and others, for allegedly breaching securities laws. The president-elect also promised to make Bitcoin a reserve currency in the U.S., and most importantly, advocated for a crypto-friendly regulation. Both these two promises are particularly exciting to the crypto community, due to the potential impact it would have on the global markets. Trump’s huge election win explains why many crypto traders are optimistic about the future, and thus the current rally that has seen Bitcoin trade above $90,000, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) cross $3,200 and several other altcoins hit new all-time highs. However, sentiment-driven rallies tend to be short-lived, which is why, even if Bitcoin hits $100,000 before January, it could still experience a pullback in the weeks or months following Trump’s swearing-in. Trump's win can have a better impact Firstly, once the sentimentality is out of the window, investors will begin to assess their options with a longer-term view whilst keeping a close eye on Trump’s ability to deliver on his promises. If Trump made Bitcoin a reserve currency in the U.S., it could be a matter of time before other countries do the same, in which case, it would result in increased demand for the world’s biggest cryptocurrency. There has been a lot of debate about whether or not Bitcoin has essentially replaced gold as a safe-haven asset, with some research failing to yield conclusive results after putting the theory to the test. The crypto community will also be watching to see what measures Trump takes towards implementing a regulatory framework that encourages crypto innovation and attracts more mainstream players to the industry. Investors will want to see progress from the previous administration. Whilst the SEC may be seen as being one of the stumbling blocks for the crypto industry in the U.S. over the last three years, it also made some key regulatory milestones with the approvals of Spot Bitcoin and Spot Ethereum ETFs. Since the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) has surged to a market cap of $40.9 billion, making it one of the biggest ETFs across all categories. BlackRock is one of the several traditional asset managers that expanded their product offerings to include digital assets in January. $100,000 may not necessarily be the short-term ceiling Trading View Technically, Bitcoin has completed an upward channel breakout to trade above $90,000. The latest spike in price comes hot on the heels of the pre-election gains that saw the BTC-USD rally from about $52,000 in September to over $73,000 at the start of November. The last time Bitcoin experienced such a rally was between January and March after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved multiple Spot Bitcoin ETFs. But what Bitcoin is experiencing now is a spike never seen before, after setting a new record daily gain of $8.4k on Monday. Given the intense buying activity over the past ten days, many have started to predict that the BTC-USD could hit $100,000 before the end of the year. But given it’s already trading above $90,000, unless some profit-taking kicks in even $110,000 looks realistic at this point. If Bitcoin hits $110, it will be worth north of $2.1 trillion, becoming a multi-trillion dollar asset for the first time. However, if Bitcoin experiences some profit-taking, potentially halting its climb in the short term, declines below its post-Spot ETF approvals high are unlikely. Still, the $55,000 level provides long-term support, which could become effective if Trump takes longer than anticipated to begin to implement his ‘crypto manifesto’. Stephen Wundke, Strategy and Revenue Director at quantitative digital asset investment firm Algoz, who claims to have successfully predicted the path of the BTC price this year to date, believes that if Trump delivers on his word to the crypto community, the macroeconomic forces would likely play a huge role in rallying the bitcoin price and the crypto market overall. Wundke who believes much of Bitcoin’s price movement this year has been dictated by macroeconomic factors also can’t wait to see if the pioneer cryptocurrency maintains this trend or deviates to take an independent path. “If the broader-based, crypto market and its various altcoins is also to enjoy a strong rally then it will be because President-Elect Trump is good to his word from the BTC Nashville Conference, where he laid out a strong case for the integration of cryptocurrency into the mainstream of federal finance,” Wundke argued, responding to my commentary outreach. However, it remains to be seen whether or not Trump made those promises for campaign purposes without having any intention of honouring them. There is already speculation that the SEC chair Gary Gensler will resign at the end of December, which generally would fulfill one of Trump’s first promises. During the Nashville Bitcoin event, the President-Elect vowed to fire Gensler on day one. Once that happens, traders will be looking forward to the plans that Trump will put in place to deliver his other promises, starting with appointing a more crypto-friendly person to be the chair of the SEC and then establishing a Bitcoin treasury. Risks Bitcoin’s latest rally has attracted significant inflows, which means at some point in the near future, some investors may start taking profits. That could lead to a significant pullback in the BTC-USD price, as has been the case multiple times in the past. From a fundamental perspective, if Trump fails to put measures in place to deliver on his promises, investors could interpret his remarks at the Nashville Bitcoin event as nothing than campaign tactics, in which case, Bitcoin could begin to shed a lot of the gains it has made over the past three months. Conclusion While Bitcoin’s latest rally is driven by Trump’s big election win, many traders will be waiting to see whether he delivers on the promises he made to the industry. After rallying to trade above $90,000, Bitcoin now seems destined to touch $100,000 by the end of the year, before potentially touching $110,000. The higher figure could be achieved based on how quickly Trump implements his ‘crypto manifesto’.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4738093-trumps-pre-election-crypto-promises-could-spur-bitcoin-to-a-multi-trillion-asset?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36395392.jpeg
36395364,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653386,1731754800,Cardano (ADA) To Reach $6 By September 2025? Analyst Forecast 2021-Like Rally,"Cardano (ADA) has seen a massive rally in the last few weeks, surging over 81% in the past fourteen days. As the cryptocurrency continues breaking past key levels, a renowned crypto analyst highlighted its potential 2,000% climb. Related Reading: Analysts Bullish On Dogwifhat (WIF) $5 Target As Price Retests $4 Resistance Cardano To Hit $6 By Q3 2025 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez forecasted that Cardano might hit the $6 mark by September 2025. Earlier this year, the analyst noted that ADA’s chart reassembled a pattern similar to 2020, which suggests that the cryptocurrency could experience a rally like 2020-2021’s bull run. Per the post, ADA broke out from its two-year consolidation in early 2020 before retracing 75% and consolidating for most of the year. By November 2020, the token bounced from the accumulation range and started its massive 4,000% rally, which lasted around nine months. This year, Cardano has seen a similar move during the first leg of the cycle, reaching its year-high of $0.81 before retracing 75% and consolidating between the $0.6-$0.27 price range for the last eight months. Following the crypto market’s recent rally, fueled by Trump’s victory in the US elections and the Federal Reserve’s decision to reduce interest rates by 0.25, Cardano has experienced a massive 50% weekly surge. Martinez previously forecasted that ADA could experience the second leg’s initial jump on November 18, around two weeks after the US elections. However, the cryptocurrency reclaimed the $0.6 support zone and broke above the $0.65 horizontal level earlier today. This performance represents an eight-month high for Cardano, which has been heavily criticized for underperforming against most altcoins. According to the chart, ADA might move sideways around this range for the following days before challenging its year-high price. If ADA continues replicating the last cycle’s pattern, the cryptocurrency could reach the long-awaited $1 by year-end. Additionally, it could surpass its previous $3.09 all-time high (ATH) by Q1 2025 before entering price discovery mode. Martinez suggested that Cardano could rise over 2,000% toward the $6 mark, reaching its top between July and September 2025. ADA Among Today’s Market Leaders While most cryptocurrencies in the top 100 move sideways, ADA has soared 21 % in the last 24 hours. The token surged as the third-best performer today, behind XRP and ALGO. Besides the general economic and geopolitical factors, its recent performance has also been fueled by speculation surrounding Cardano’s potential involvement with Trump’s administration. On Thursday, a member of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the United Nations (UN), Shawn, shared on X that re-elected President Trump is exploring a federal voting and identity verification system based on blockchain technology. Related Reading: Dogecoin Frenzy Arrives In Korea: ‘Kimchi Premium’ Returns Amid DOGE’s 110% Rally Speculation arose when another X user claimed that Cardano’s founder Charles Hoskinson is “already in talks with the Trump administration,” arguing that “they’ve been working with the state of Wyoming on voting systems for a couple of years now.” Cardano has rallied an impressive 84% in the last month, breaking above the $0.65 mark for the first time since late March and recovering its top 10 crypto spot.

XRP had a slow start to the ongoing phase of the bull run, which began on the back of the Donald Trump victory in the U.S. presidential election nearly two weeks ago. While Bitcoin claimed new all-time highs days after the election victory, XRP struggled to maintain the $0.57 price level.XRP Finally Clinches $1This underperformance triggered panic, with some investors expressing concerns that the altcoin might also miss out on this bull run. However, XRP began its uptrend this week, breaking above the $0.60 level on Monday, and leveraging this territory to engineer more substantial surges.The token sustained this upsurge, with a mild pullback on Nov. 13 that saw it drop 1.94%. A resumption of the rally allowed it to reclaim the psychological levels at $0.70, $0.80 and $0.90 on Nov. 14 and 15. Now, XRP has officially clinched the much-coveted $1 price after spiking 14.72% today.The last time XRP saw this price was in December 2021, as it dropped from the $1.96 peak in April of that year. Several analysts have suggested that the $1 mark represents the launchpad that XRP needs to aim for further growth toward its ATH of $3.31.What Next?At press time, XRP now changes hands at $1.0209. The token needs to push toward the $1.2 region to solidify its position above the $1 mark. However, with its Commodity Channel Index currently at 252.23, XRP could face a slight pullback before the bullish momentum resumes. XRP 1D Chart 2 XRP 1D Chart Should this occur, the $1.018 level could serve as the immediate support level above $1. XRP needs to hold above this zone to hedge against any drops below $1. Below this, the Fibonacci 0.786 region at $0.9047 and the upper Bollinger Band support at $0.8854 would serve as the next lines of defense.However, if the bulls sustain the upward push, XRP’s next target could be the 1.618 Fibonacci level at $1.3457 . Should the token breach this area, it could come face to face with the $1.87 price around Fibonacci 2.618. Beyond this, XRP eyes the $2.4 price, climbing toward its ATH. XRP would need to rise 135% to reach $2.4.Meanwhile, the recent rally has allowed XRP to claim a $59 billion market cap, currently seeking to reach the $60 billion mark. The asset has now surpassed Dogecoin (DOGE) to become the sixth-largest crypto asset, with 26.69% increase over the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,DOGE | XRP,ALTCOIN | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/16/xrp-finally-crosses-the-1-mark-for-the-first-time-since-2021-amid-26-spike-whats-next/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-finally-crosses-the-1-mark-for-the-first-time-since-2021-amid-26-spike-whats-next,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36393444,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653338,1731751239,Bitcoin Bears In Trouble: $800 Million Set For Liquidation If BTC Reclaims This Price,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a tear recently, hitting multiple all-time highs (ATH) levels since Donald Trump emerged victorious in the 2024 US presidential elections. Although the top cryptocurrency has witnessed a slight pullback in the past 24 hours, rebounding to an earlier price level could spell trouble for the bears. Bitcoin Bears Could Be Under Trouble According to analysis shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez on X, more than $800 million is at risk of liquidation if the flagship digital asset reclaims the $93,000 price level. Notably, BTC’s current ATH stands at $93,477. Related Reading: Binance Dominates As Bitcoin Futures Volume Hits New Peaks Amid Historic Price Rally At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $89,480, down 1.9% in the past 24 hours. On the 4-hour chart, BTC’s next prominent support level appears to be around the $86,000. The digital asset has already tested this support level three times, and a further dip to this price could send BTC tumbling toward $81,600, its next major support. If BTC fails to hold above $81,600, a decline to $79,700 may follow. While a lower BTC price would favor the bears, a reclaim of the $93,000 level could severely hurt them. Such a move would risk over $800 million in liquidations, potentially forcing bearish traders to capitulate. Data from Coinglass shows that contracts worth more than $508 million were liquidated in the past 24 hours. Of this, $355 million were long, while $153 million were short. A recent analysis by prominent crypto analyst @CryptoKaleo suggests that Martinez’s warning for bears may be justified. According to @CryptoKaleo, BTC could retrace to $86,000 before embarking on another rally to set new ATHs – possibly beyond $100,000. The analyst stated: Just a little dip and a bit more ranging then send to $100K+. Honestly think this is the best case scenario for alts if we somehow get it. Would look for outperformance while BTC is accumulating around $90K. What’s Behind BTC’s Run? Multiple factors have contributed to BTC’s historic price action, including the halving earlier this year, the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and rising institutional adoption of the digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Surpass 1 Million BTC Holdings In Less Than A Year Since Launch – Details Inside However, Trump’s win in the 2024 US presidential elections – a result seen as pro-crypto – served as a major catalyst for BTC’s surge. Since Trump’s victory on November 5, BTC has climbed from around $69,000 to a high of $93,000, recording gains of more than 30% in just 10 days. Despite this impressive price rally, experts suggest that BTC may have further room to grow. For instance, a recent research report predicts that BTC’s bullish momentum could continue until mid-2025 when it is expected to peak. Additionally, relatively low profit-taking during this bull run could further propel BTC to new heights. However, bulls should remain cautious of a significant CME gap around the $78,000 level, which could be a magnet for price correction. At the time of writing, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at $2.904 trillion, reflecting a 3.7% decline over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance is at 60.97%, underscoring BTC’s continued strength in the market.

XRP is making history in the crypto space amid the ongoing bull run. It maintains its streak of bullish performance and shows strong momentum toward breaking the long-lost $1 region. As of press time, XRP has gained 21% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.9687, a level not seen in three years.Interestingly, XRP's impressive price surge happened at a time when Bitcoin lost momentum, following its peak of $93K earlier this week.Notably, XRP was at just $0.4935 two weeks ago and has since surged to $0.9821. This marks a massive 99% gain since early November. This remarkable performance has garnered attention from industry leaders, including Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse.Ripple CEO: XRP Pumping as Pressure EasesIn a recent interview with FOX, Garlinghouse attributed XRP’s strong performance to the promising regulatory outlook in the U.S. under the newly elected President, Donald Trump.Garlinghouse pointed out that Trump’s election has brought hope to the crypto industry—particularly among U.S.-based companies—which had long been under attack by the SEC.Garlinghouse emphasized that the crypto community now benefits from a pro-crypto president who has embraced the industry. He highlighted that in the two weeks following Trump's election, some of the best-performing crypto assets were tokens like XRP and ADA, which are linked to U.S.-based crypto companies.“This shouldn’t be a surprise,” Garlinghouse said. He noted that the SEC has pressured U.S. crypto firms and technologies for years.

XRP's jaw-dropping performance in the past few days has left many investors stunned. The coin, which plunged below $0.52 after the SEC appealed the Ripple ruling, has skyrocketed to the $0.9 mark. XRP Achieves 2 Major Milestones Following its remarkable performance, top crypto experts called the public’s attention to two significant milestones XRP achieved recently. New Weekly Close Above $0.75 Since March 2022According to an X post, Abdullah Nassif of the Good Morning Crypto podcast emphasized that XRP’s surge to $0.9 marks its first weekly close above $0.75 in over two years. Nassif emphasized that the last time XRP had a weekly close of $0.75 was in March 2022, suggesting that the coin has failed to surpass this level ever since. At the time of the post, XRP was trading at $0.9081, with a 26.98% daily increase. https://twitter.com/AbsGMCrypto/status/1857437691756921221Highest Daily Close Since December 2021Furthermore, Anderson, a widely-followed digital asset researcher, highlighted another significant feat achieved by the seventh-biggest cryptocurrency. In a tweet today, Anderson claimed XRP’s daily closing price spiked to a level not seen since December 27, 2021, nearly three years ago. It is worth mentioning that XRP was hovering at around $0.9 when Anderson made the comment. XRP Moves Close to Hitting $1 Meanwhile, XRP has continued to register significant gains as it looks forward to rising above the $1 mark. Its recent attempts to hit the $1 mark have failed in the hours leading up to press time. Currently, XRP is trading at $0.9742, less than $0.0258 away from hitting the coveted $1 price mark. Should XRP hit $1, it would be 73.95% shy of reaching its previous all-time high of $3.84, registered nearly seven years ago on January 4, 2018. Notably, XRP boasts a 24-hour trading volume of $12.14 billion and a market cap of $55.46 billion.

Market commentator Javon Marks is one individual championing this bullish outlook. The analyst had identified bullish structures around Shiba Inu in the 6-day timeframe when the current bull run was still in its early phase as of Nov. 3.Shiba Inu Sustains Uptrend At the time, Shiba Inu had increased to a price of $0.0000193, knocking at the $0.00002 psychological price territory. Now, a week after this analysis SHIB has jumped 57%, as it now changes hands at $0.00002578. Meanwhile, according to Javon Marks, this spike might only be the beginning, with further substantial gains potentially on the horizon. Marks’ latest analysis spotlights important developments on SHIB’s 6-day price chart that confirm the bullish projection.The market analyst’s chart identifies hidden bullish divergences on the price action as the price springs upward. These signals often indicate sustained upward momentum, with the potential for further gains. Shiba Inu 6D Chart | Javon Marks Marks had previously noted the significance of the hidden bullish divergence forming on SHIB’s chart. These divergences often indicate underlying strength, even when prices appear subdued. Combined with the ongoing bullish Bitcoin market , SHIB could be riding a wave of broader crypto market momentum.The chart shows that SHIB has been on a steady upward trajectory since completing its bottom formation at $0.00001078 in August 2024. The breakout appears to have been confirmed, with the cryptocurrency now trading well above its previous resistance levels. SHIB Could Target $0.0001553In his earlier report, Marks confirmed that he believes this progression could set the stage for an explosive move toward $0.000081, about 8.6% from the all-time high of $0.00008845 attained in October 2021. The $0.000081 represents a potential 214% increase from current levels.However, the latest analysis from Marks suggests the rally may not stop there. He projects a scenario where Shiba Inu breaks above the $0.000081 target and reaches new highs at $0.0001553. If it materializes, this prediction will represent an over 500% surge from its recent price. Such a move would push SHIB to a new all-time high. This price level would take Shiba Inu to a market cap of $91 billion, representing a feasible goal for the meme coin.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/16/market-expert-projects-shiba-inu-rally-to-0-0001553-following-57-spike/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=market-expert-projects-shiba-inu-rally-to-0-0001553-following-57-spike,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
36390115,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653369,1731745840,Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit 5-Year Low—What Does This Signal?,"The Bitcoin market appears to have taken an intriguing turn as the asset’s reserves on centralized exchanges have hit the lowest levels since November 2018. This development, highlighted by a CryptoQuant analyst known as G a a h, points out a notable change in BTC’s investor behavior within the crypto space and also suggests quite an interesting trend for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crosses $93,000 – Is There More Room for Gains or Are We Nearing a Peak? Bitcoin Reserves On Exchanges Reach Five-Year Low According to the analyst, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges have diminished significantly throughout 2024, reflecting a shift towards long-term holding strategies among market participants. This trend suggests that investors increasingly transfer their assets to private wallets, reducing the supply available for immediate sale and contributing to buying pressure in a market already constrained by supply. According to G a a h, this behavior indicates a broader sentiment shift, with market participants displaying increased confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value amidst “economic uncertainty and rising inflation.” By moving Bitcoin away from exchanges, investors reduce the likelihood of sudden sell-offs, which can lead to increased price stability. However, the reduced supply on exchanges may also lead to heightened volatility, especially if demand continues to grow or remains consistent. The CryptoQuant analyst noted: With that said, this scenario signals a potentially more volatile but more resilient Bitcoin market, with less selling pressure and a growing dominance of long-term holders, which could open up space for new price peaks. BTC’s Upward Momentum Cools Off Following an all-time high (ATH) of $93,477 on Wednesday, November 13, BTC has faced quite a noticeable correction, now down by 4% from this peak. So far, the asset has been unable to continue its upward momentum and appears to be seeing more sell-offs. When writing, Bitcoin trades below $90,000 with a current trading price of $89,779, down by 1.4% in the past day. This price decline resulted in roughly $49 billion subtracted from its market capitalization valuation on Wednesday. For context, as of today, BTC’s market cap sits at $1.775 trillion, a nearly 5% decrease from the $1.835 trillion valuation two days ago. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume dropped from over $100 billion earlier this week to below $85 billion.

Cardano is currently one of the top gainers in its asset class, with bullish macroeconomics fueling its recent price surge. ADA has shown impressive growth across all timeframes, with increases of 23%, 69%, and a staggering 109% in the daily, weekly, and monthly charts, respectively.In addition to the ongoing broader market, several developments unique to Cardano has contributed to ADA's uptrend.

Notably, ADA has surged 70% since Hoskinson disclosed the possible partnership.Marke Expert Predicts a 713% Cardano UpsurgeMeanwhile, amid the latest rally, seasoned analyst Ali Martinez expects further Cardano upsides, speculating an upswing to $6.

XRP has continued to turn heads within the crypto market following its incredible surge over the past few days. Robinhood recently acknowledged XRP’s remarkable performance, highlighting the asset as one of the top 10 cryptos with the biggest weekly gains on its platform. XRP Shines on Robinhood Notably, XRP ranked among the top 10 best-performing cryptos this week on Robinhood’s European and American Arm. On Robinhood Europe, XRP was the fifth best-performing cryptocurrency, boasting a weekly gain of 48.8% as of November 15, 2024. It ranked behind dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Pepe (PEPE), which surged 58.3%, 70%, 88.1%, and 100.7% in the same timeframe, respectively. Conversely, XRP outperformed other prominent cryptos like Cardano (ADA), Render (RENDER), Stellar (XLM), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which witnessed spikes of 42.3%, 34.6%, 31.4%, 31%, and 27.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, XRP claimed the third position among the top 10 best-performing cryptos on the U.S. arm of Robinhood’s trading platform. While XRP ranked behind DOGE and PEPE, it led assets like ADA, XLM, SHIB, BTC, AVAX, LTC, and BCH in terms of weekly gains. For context, as of November 15, BTC, AVAX, LTC, and BCH prices soared by 17.3%, 16.5%, 16.3%, and 14% in one week, respectively. Robinhood Relists XRP Robinhood highlighted XRP’s incredible performance days after relisting the coin on its U.S. platform. Recall that Robinhood was among the trading platforms that delisted XRP after the U.S. SEC charged Ripple with offering the coin as an unregistered security. Despite a U.S. federal court labeling XRP a non-security in July 2023, Robinhood failed to relist the coin like Coinbase and Kraken did. In September 2024, Robinhood quietly relisted XRP on its European arm and made the coin available to its U.S. customers earlier this week. XRP Explodes to Nearly $1 In the meantime, XRP’s price has exploded tremendously, closing in on the $1 psychological mark. The coin soared to $0.9771 today, with its market cap hitting $55.63 billion. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP has witnessed a surge of 73% over the past week and 18.02% in the past day. Several factors are responsible for the ongoing rally, such as speculation of a meeting between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump, as well as Gary Gensler’s potential departure from the SEC. These developments hint at a possible settlement of the Ripple lawsuit, which has lingered since December 2020 and has wreaked havoc on XRP’s price. With investors expecting the lawsuit to be resolved under Trump’s administration, XRP has witnessed a growing demand leading to its remarkable price surge.",POSITIVE,SHIB | XRP | NEAR,MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | XRP | NEAR,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/16/xrp-takes-top-spot-on-robinhood-biggest-movers-list-following-its-relisting/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-takes-top-spot-on-robinhood-biggest-movers-list-following-its-relisting,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Galaxy Digital CEO Unveils Bold 5-10 Year Forecast,"Now that Bitcoin short-term price action remains bullish, driven by US President Donald Trump’s vocal support for crypto, analysts ponder the following question: How will Bitcoin perform in five to 10 years? For Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz, using gold as a benchmark, Bitcoin can hit $800,000 in five to 10 years. Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor In a Bloomberg Television interview, Novogratz joins other analysts on their bullish take on the top digital asset. He added that Bitcoin will remain upward and trade at $800k in the next five to 10 years, approximating gold’s $16 trillion market value. Bitcoin To Match Gold’s Market Cap: Analysts Trump’s win is arguably one of the triggers for Bitcoin’s recent price action. A few days ago, Bitcoin edged out silver in the list of Top 10 assets in the market cap department. Today, the digital asset tops Saudi Aramco on the same list, with a valuation of $1.79 trillion. With the continuous climb in digital assets, many ask if they match gold’s market cap. According to Novogratz, the shift in market interest among the new generation of consumers and traders is helping Bitcoin. He stated that today’s investors prefer Bitcoin, which is considered a digital store of value. Aside from Novogratz, other market analysts and industry personalities use gold as Bitcoin’s benchmark. For example, Howard Lutnick and Anthony Scarammucci have also compared both assets, saying that Bitcoin will beat gold’s market cap soon. Bitcoin To Trade In $500k Level If It Becomes Part Of US Reserve The Galaxy Digital founder also predicts that Bitcoin’s price will hit $500k if the US government decides to integrate the digital asset as part of the Treasury. Novogratz made this bold projection based on the current bullish trend and potentially favorable policies for crypto. Novogratz added that if the US decides to acquire up to 1 million BTC, then this will force other governments to invest as well, pushing the demand. In addition, Trump’s support for Bitcoin and crypto is also fueling the bullish run of the asset. Novogratz Not Confident On Government’s Decision To Add BTC As Reserve Asset Although Novogratz identifies a $500k target, he thinks the US Treasury will likely not add this asset. He predicts that there’s a considerable chance the bill may not pass the Senate’s approval, although the House gives its go-signal. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Watch: 60% Rally Catches Whale Attention – Is More Growth Ahead? Novogratz remains bullish on Bitcoin and advises the US government to acquire more and double down on its campaign to promote digital assets. He added that the government doesn’t need to support the USD with other assets. In the same Bloomberg interview, he further shared that he’s heavily invested in Bitcoin and will welcome the possibility of the reserve bill getting approved.

The latest analysis comes on the back of the recent XRP price recovery, as the altcoin pushes above the $0.90 price territory. Notably, the report centers on expanding Bollinger Bands, critical momentum oscillators and key Fibonacci levels.XRP Bollinger Bands and Momentum OscillatorsThe Bollinger Bands, which measure volatility, show a new phase of expansion after over a year of contraction. Historically, XRP has followed similar contractions and expansions with massive price surges. The last two instances of this pattern, in 2017 and 2020, led to some of XRP’s most notable bull runs. For context, the altcoin rallied by nearly 60,000% to hit $3.31 in 2018 and by over 700% to claim $1.96 in 2021 following previous expansions.Interestingly, Bobby A also presented three momentum oscillators whose alignment has historically preceded XRP’s largest price moves. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one such indicator, showing a pattern that closely resembles its behavior during past breakouts. Particularly, each time the RSI retested its signal line below the 50 level and then spiked upward, XRP entered a strong bullish phase. This setup occurred before the 2017/2018 breakout and also before XRP surged in 2021. XRP 1M Chart | Bobby A In addition, the Stochastic RSI is showing bullish signs. Historically, when the Stochastic RSI dipped below the 0 mark, retested the signal line, and then crossed above it, XRP experienced a major rally.Meanwhile, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator strengthens the case for a bullish breakout. During previous surges, the MACD line crossing above its signal line and the appearance of bullish histogram bars marked the start of strong upward trends. All three momentum oscillators featured these patterns at the same time in the 2017/2018 market cycle, right before XRP spiked to $3.31. Further, these signals also came up in the 2020/2021 cycle, preceding XRP’s rapid surge to $1.96.XRP Profit-Taking Targets on Fibonacci LevelsNow, all indicators are showing the exact same signs. The alignment of these indicators is particularly noteworthy because such a confluence has only occurred twice before in XRP’s history, both times leading to monumental price increases. Meanwhile, XRP currently trades around $0.97, up 91% this month as it stages its own uptick. XRP has immediate support at the Fibonacci 0.236 level, roughly $0.8722. Should the rally persist, and the price reclaim the $1 threshold , it would open the door to the next resistance levels at $1.34 and $1.72, corresponding to the Fibonacci 0.382 and 0.5 levels, respectively. These are important zones for bulls to conquer before XRP can aim for higher price targets. Bobby A predicts further upside with Fibonacci levels on the 1-month chart, which outline ambitious but attainable profit targets. He identifies the first major target at $5.3, corresponding to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. From there, subsequent targets include $8.52, $11.73, and $13.72, all lying within a defined “take-profit zone” on the chart. These targets suggest XRP could see exponential gains in a manner similar to previous market cycles. Amid the upsurge, XRP is also witnessing rising volumes. key component of sustained rallies. Volume increases often signal growing interest and momentum, and this trend is now visible on XRP’s chart.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/16/expert-sets-xrp-profit-taking-targets-at-5-8-11-and-13-as-4-key-indicators-align-for-bullish-run/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-sets-xrp-profit-taking-targets-at-5-8-11-and-13-as-4-key-indicators-align-for-bullish-run,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Recall that Garlinghouse liked an X post from Zach Rector, suggesting he met with Trump after the election. Although the Ripple CEO did not specifically confirm the meeting in a statement, his engagement with the post gave XRP enthusiasts the indication that he met with Trump. FOX Business Confirms the Meeting During an interview with Garlinghouse, FOX Business anchorwoman Liz Claman raised the matter, asking the Ripple CEO to confirm whether the reported meeting with the U.S. President-Elect had taken place. Responding, Garlinghouse jokingly said he would not like to “comment on too many specifics.” Interestingly, Liz emphasized that she would consider Garlinghouse’s response a “yes.” XRP Skyrockets After Meeting Rumors Meanwhile, rumors of Garlinghouse meeting with Trump after the presidential election had a tremendous impact on the price of XRP, which exploded above the $0.9 mark yesterday. This surge follows speculations that the longstanding lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple might be ending soon. The lawsuit has negatively impacted XRP’s performance since it was introduced on December 22, 2020. Since the lawsuit, XRP has missed major rallies, including the 2021 bull run. While several XRP enthusiasts believed the legal tussle would finally be settled after U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres issued the final judgment in August, the SEC appealed the ruling two months later. The regulator hoped to overturn the parts of the ruling it lost to Ripple at the Second Circuit, potentially extending the timeframe for a resolution. This appeal wreaked havoc on XRP's price, which crashed below the $0.52 mark. However, XRP skyrocketed above $0.9 amid reports of a meeting between Garlinghouse and Trump, as well as SEC Chair Gary Gensler hinting at a possible exit from the commission. At press time, XRP is trading at $0.9680, marking a 24-hour increase of 20.13% and a weekly surge of 75.73%. Furthermore, XRP’s daily volume has exploded 4.3% to $11.4 billion. Its market cap currently stands at $54.68 billion, trailing Dogecoin’s $55.23 valuation by just $550 million.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/16/fox-business-confirms-ripple-ceo-meeting-with-donald-trump/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fox-business-confirms-ripple-ceo-meeting-with-donald-trump,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36383197,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653296,1731735055,Why Is XRP Price Up Today? Key Reasons Explained,"The XRP price is experiencing a significant uptick, rising 20% over the past two days and an impressive 47% in the last five days. The surge can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including speculation surrounding SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s potential resignation, favorable regulatory tailwinds under the incoming Trump administration, increased whale activity, and a notable technical breakout. #1 Speculation About SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s Resignation A primary driver behind XRP’s recent price movement is the growing speculation regarding the possible resignation of Gary Gensler, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On November 14, Gensler delivered a speech at the Practicing Law Institute’s 56th annual conference on securities regulation, where he lauded the efforts of the SEC. “It’s been a great honor to serve with them, doing the people’s work, and ensuring that our capital markets remain the best in the world,” Gensler stated. The crypto community on Xinterprets this speech as a potential farewell address, especially in light of the upcoming transition following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. Investors anticipate that the Trump administration will appoint a pro-crypto chairman to lead the SEC. “I will fire Gary Gensler on day one,” Trump pledged during the Bitcoin 2024 conference. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, echoed these sentiments on X: “Joined Cantor’s annual Crypto Conference today – safe to say that the US is ready to be the crypto capital of the world with the next Trump Administration. Also an apt shirt to wear..on perhaps what are Gary Gensler’s last days in office?!” After Gensler’s resignation, there’s speculation that the SEC might reconsider its appeal against Ripple Labs, potentially alleviating regulatory pressures that have weighed heavily on the XRP price over the last years. #2 Regulatory Tailwinds For XRP Under Trump The anticipated policy shift under the incoming Trump administration is another critical factor contributing to the XRP price appreciation. The administration is reportedly preparing to adopt a more permissive stance toward crypto, with plans to appoint industry-friendly candidates to key regulatory positions. “Chatted with Tony Romm about how the incoming Trump Administration is already engaging proactively with the crypto industry on clear rules of the road… what a breath of fresh air!” Garlinghouse remarked today on X. Further emphasizing the potential positive impact, Garlinghouse stated via X: “I’ve shared some thoughts on what the Trump administration could mean for crypto and wanted to also recognize the XRP family’s patience and unwavering support. A lot has happened since XRP was the 2nd most valuable digital asset. It’s been – at times – a frustrating journey. ~6 years since the SEC started meddling in the crypto market, picking winners and losers… ~4 years since the SEC sued Ripple. He added, “Now FINALLY we see a light at the end of the tunnel as these external (frankly unnatural and manipulative) market factors fade. The tides are shifting, headwinds are turning to tailwinds, and the opportunity for those of us who believe in the future for XRP is enormous!” #3 Increased XRP Whale Activity Whale activity, indicative of large-scale investments by major holders, has also played a significant role in the XRP price surge. On-chain analysis firm Santiment reports on X: “Wallets with at least 1M XRP now hold a combined 45.61B tokens, their highest amount held since June 2018. In the past 2 years, whales & sharks have reversed course and accumulated 3.44B more XRP, a +8.16% increase. Traders have enjoyed a +40% return in the past 7 days.” #4 Technical Breakout Complementing the fundamental drivers are technical factors contributing to the XRP price action. XRP has broken above a six-year-long symmetrical triangle pattern, a significant technical indicator that suggests the potential for sustained upward momentum. Historically, such breakouts have preceded notable price increases, and in XRP’s case, the price had previously declined by as much as 97% during the formation of this pattern. At press time, XRP traded at $0.85.

SHIB, the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization, is now trading at approximately $0.00002803 with a 24-hour trading volume of $5.69 billion. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Watch: 60% Rally Catches Whale Attention – Is More Growth Ahead? This steep surge inspired a new wave of enthusiasm among investors, both retail and institutional, as SHIB continues to prove itself to be more viable in the meme coin space. The upward rise of the coin sparked interest on X (Twitter), a site that has garnered over 41,300 postings mentioning SHIB in recent hours, keeping the speculation going. $SHIB ❤️❤️💥❤️❤️ pic.twitter.com/k2TmXwhPil — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) November 13, 2024 Lucie’s Bullish Outlook For Shiba Inu Lucie, the marketing director of Shiba Inu, has been publicly vocal about her favorable assessment of the token, asserting that SHIB will soon achieve a price target of $0.00006. She recently emphasized SHIB’s exceptional lifetime performance in a tweet, which includes an astonishing increase of over 1.9 million percent against the dollar since its inception. The tweet created interest, and propelled SHIB to a seven-month high of $0.00003031 then sold off slightly, despite the fact that Lucie did not give an exact timeline as when this should happen. Her enthusiasm is contagious, and many investors are holding out at this point awaiting SHIB to continue on its upward trend, potentially reaching new heights to surpass its October 2021 all-time high of $0.00008616. Whale Activity Indicates Profit-Taking Opportunity Along with the price increase, SHIB has seen increased activity from large holders, or “whales,” who are frequently major market movers. Recently, a whale with the address “0xd6b” returned to the market after an eight-month absence, coinciding with SHIB’s recent advances. This whale, an early investor who previously profited $120 million from SHIB, transferred 100 billion SHIB, worth $2.81 million, to the Gemini Exchange. This move shows that the whale may be profiting from the continued rally. While such moves frequently foreshadow a possible cooling spell, they also indicate that significant investors are closely monitoring SHIB’s price behavior, which contributes to overall market sentiment. Looking Ahead: Could Altcoins Surge? As Shiba Inu maintains its recent momentum, the future is bright. While Lucie has cautioned that we may not yet be experiencing a full “Altcoin Season,” SHIB’s burgeoning social media presence and excitement over its possible rally suggest a shift in investor opinion. Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor The anticipation of a breakout that can take SHIB up to new levels has left the investors quite bullish, and most are waiting for possible developments in the market.

The analyst further explained what to expect from the flagship crypto moving forward, having entered this phase of the bull run. What To Expect From Bitcoin In ‘Thrill’ Phase In an X post, Ash Crypto revealed that Bitcoin is entering the thrill phase. Based on this, he told market participants to expect high volatility and more liquidation. Overall, the analyst remarked that the Bitcoin price trend will be to the upside as it continues to hit new all-time highs (ATHs). He predicts that BTC will rally to as high as $150,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Major Price Crash For Shiba Inu, But It’s Not All Bad News His accompanying chart showed that the thrill phase of the market cycle is when investors and traders may get overexcited about the bull rally and decide to go all in with leverage. However, as Ash Crypto indicated, this could go wrong since there will be a lot of liquidations during this period. Despite this being a bull market, the Bitcoin price has, at different times, corrected after reaching new highs and flushing out over-leveraged longs in the process. Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Research, also explained earlier in the year that bull markets aren’t straight lines up and that significant price corrections are expected. However, in the long run, the bears get the short end of the stick in a bull run as prices trend upwards. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently revealed that over $800 million will be liquidated if Bitcoin rebounds towards $93,000. This is a price level that BTC just reached two days ago as it rallied to a new ATH of $93,400. The Bitcoin price has since corrected and dropped below $90,000. This was partly due to the US PPI inflation data, which was higher than forecasted. That development has cast some doubts about whether the Fed will be willing to further cut interest rates in December. More Price Correction In The Short Term? Ali Martinez suggested that the Bitcoin price could experience further declines in the short term. In an X post, the crypto analyst said that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that Bitcoin is in overbought territory, which typically signals a potential price correction ahead. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Drive The Dogecoin Price To $1 This Bull Market This price correction could also happen as Bitcoin investors look to secure profits. Martinez revealed that $5.2 billion in BTC profits have been realized and that the sell-side risk ratio has surged to 0.524%. He warned market participants to stay alert and proceed with caution. Bhutan Government falls among whales that are already securing profits as they recently sold $33 million worth of BTC, just weeks after selling $66 million BTC.

36373666,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653252,1731720655,WIF Slide Below $3.582 Sparks Fears Of Further Losses,"WIF latest dip below the crucial $3.582 support has triggered concerns across the market, as bearish sentiment appears to be gathering strength. Its break below this key level could pave the way for even greater losses, leaving traders to question whether the bulls can stage a comeback or if further declines are inevitable. As downside risks grow, this analysis aims to examine WIF’s recent drop below the critical $3.582 support level and explore the potential implications of this bearish shift for future price movement. By assessing current market sentiment, key technical indicators, and possible support zones, we seek to determine whether WIF is positioned for more losses or if a reversal may be on the horizon. Examining WIF’s Drop Below The Critical $3.582 Support Level On the 4-hour chart, WIF has recently broken below the $3.582 level, triggering bearish momentum as the price moves toward the $2.896 support range and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). As the bearish trend develops, the market is closely watching for any signs of stabilization or a deeper slide toward key support zones. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped from the overbought zone to 53%, signaling a reduction in upward momentum. This move toward neutral territory suggests that buying pressure may be waning, and market participants will be looking for indications of continued decline or a potential shift in momentum. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Set To Skyrocket 2,500%, Predicts Renowned Economist On the daily chart, WIF is showing strong negative strength, highlighted by a bearish candlestick pattern that has pushed the price below the critical $3.582 support. This pattern indicates that sellers are firmly in control of the market, relentlessly driving the price lower, prompting a strong likelihood of further drops in the near term. An analysis of the 1-day RSI suggests WIF may face extended losses as it has dropped from a high of 80% to 64%, indicating a reduction in buying pressure. Typically, this decline points to a possible weakness of bullish momentum, with more downward pressure likely if the RSI continues to wane. Potential Support Zones To Watch If WIF Continues To Drop If WIF continues to drop, key support zones to watch out for include the $2.896 level, which has previously acted as a critical point for price stabilization. Below this, the next support level to monitor is positioned around $2.257, where WIF may find additional buying interest. A break below these levels could open the door to further declines toward other psychological support zones.

Despite a 90% YTD rise, Bitcoin remains below its inflation-adjusted all-time high, with recent progress and future catalysts yet to be fully priced in. Trump’s pro-crypto stance, including potential regulatory reforms and initiatives like a US Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve, could significantly boost Bitcoin's adoption and price. Risks include regulatory uncertainty and the challenge of achieving bipartisan support for pro-crypto legislation, which could impact Bitcoin's adoption and price trajectory. Investment Thesis It is becoming increasingly difficult not be bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the stars are starting to align: Trump’s election and the institutional and corporate adoption trends hint to a sustained bullish move for BTC over a longer period of time, beyond charts and BTC cyclical pattern. Bitcoin Price YTD (GuruFocus) While Bitcoin is already up over 90% YTD and considerably outperformed both the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, I do believe that the integral part of the performance until now was a catch-up move to recover from the bear market. From an inflation-adjusted basis , Bitcoin just passed its 2021 all-time high and both the progress achieved recently and the near future catalysts still have to be priced in. Bitcoin Price YTD (GuruFocus) Bitcoin Price 3Y (GuruFocus) Trump Election While Kamala Harris was not a critic of the crypto sphere, Donald J. Trump was perceived as a much stronger backer of favorable crypto legislation. There is a double reason to that: the Democratic party and Trump himself. Indeed, the Democratic party is overall perceived as more negative with regards to crypto because the most vocal anti-crypto public figures stem from that party, in particular Elizabeth Warren (US Senator) and Gary Gensler (SEC Chair). Elizabeth Warren called Bitcoin “ a plaything for terrorists and money launderers "". Gary Gensler in his role of SEC Chair famously said about crypto “ it’s unlikely this stuff is going to be a currency .” The SEC sued Ripple in 2020 (before Gensler took office) claiming the company illegally raised money by selling a token (XRP) without registering it as a security. Since Gensler became SEC Chair, the number of lawsuits and fines rapidly multiplied leaving crypto market participants a sentiment of being somewhat persecuted: under Gensler’s SEC, the crypto industry received more than 100 enforcement actions through 2023 and spent over $400 mn defending itself against Gensler . Gensler’s SEC has been marked by a strong preference for enforcement over legal clarification. And that’s where Trump comes into play: he emerged as the most crypto-friendly candidate, as shows the 9% intraday surge of BTC reaching a new all-time high at $76,000 on the day of his election. He had announced at the Bitcoin Conference 2024 that he would “ fire Gary Gensler on Day 1 ”. While legally he cannot fire Gensler, just like he cannot fire Powell, the former did remain silent and it is broadly assumed that Gensler will leave office (unlike Powell who already confirmed that he is not leaving). Trump has several other arguments that could cause Bitcoin to continue rallying as new details are disclosed and announcements are made. The first one is that has skin in the game: he owns a crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. This project of governance platform is new and the launch has not been particularly successful. And per se that doesn’t matter: it’s the fact that he is open to cryptos to the point of launching his own crypto firm. In addition, his connections to the crypto world make it likely that he will appoint pro-crypto advisors and people in key positions. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, already announced that his firm will act as a crypto advisor for a Trump administration . Last but not least, Trump also announced the goal to create a US Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve where all confiscated Bitcoins would be held, and promised to make the US the “capital of crypto”. Adoption Trends The adoption trends show encouraging signs that more people invest more into Bitcoin. Indeed, November 7 was the single best day of BTC ETF inflows since the launch of those ETFs. ETF Inflows (CoinGlass) BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) alone registered $1.1 bn of net inflows, roughly 82% of the total $1.34 bn ETF inflows. There is also a noticeable uptrend in ETF inflows since June. On top of the ETF inflows, which are primarily indicative of institutional investors adoption, there is another metric that shows bullish signs: the corporate adoption trends. Indeed, as of today 29 different publicly companies own Bitcoin . All together, they own close to 2% of the BTC supply and the top holder is MicroStrategy Inc. ( MSTR ) which stock is up approximately 400% YTD, showing the markets appreciate the BTC accumulation strategy of the company co-founded by Michael Saylor. Corporate Holdings of BTC (CoinGecko) The list quite logically includes primarily crypto miners and crypto exchanges, but companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla Inc. (TSLA), and Block Inc. ( SQ ) are non-crypto firms holding BTC. And they have all outperformed the major US indexes on a 1-year basis, which shows that the markets likely value positively the holdings of BTC by listed companies, especially in a BTC uptrend phase. Risks As for every investment, there are risks. The high reward profile of the asset since inception compensates for the risks, although those have to be taken into account. The main risk to adoption uptrend is continued regulatory lack of clarity: a simple “no” of Gary Gensler not leaving the SEC Chair role could significantly impact BTC price but also adoption trends. If the SEC, whether chaired by Gary Gensler or someone else, does not manage to work on a comprehensive approach of clarity above enforcement, potential new BTC adopters, especially institutional and corporate, may prefer to remain on the sidelines. Additionally, President-elect Trump may surround himself with pro-crypto advisors and legal counsels to draft new regulatory propositions. However these pieces of legislation need to pass both Houses (House of Representatives and Senate). And it could be particularly intricate to achieve a bipartisan agreement on a clear and positively worded framework on a topic still as controversial as crypto. Bottom Line Beyond technical analysis based on charts that are often based on past patterns, Bitcoin’s continued outperformance may start to be disconnected from past cycles. Indeed, this is the first time the US have a pro-crypto President (Trump during his first mandate was still a crypto skeptic) willing to reach out to the crypto community to draft a new regulatory environment that would be more positive for crypto participants. A clearer legal framework could further boost adoption trends, particularly ETF inflows and corporate adoption. Ultimately, Bitcoin could be poised for a more solid, longer term uptrend beyond charts.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4738011-beyond-bitcoins-past-patterns-the-stars-are-aligning-for-increased-adoption?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36370298.jpeg
