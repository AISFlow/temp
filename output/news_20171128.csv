42400711,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKS22,1511901957,TechCrunch Founder Arrington Raising $100 Million XRP Fund,"Call it the latest sign of the sea change.  Announced today at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest in New York, TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington revealed he's raising $100 million for a hedge fund that will buy and hold crypto assets while making investments in token sales and (some) equities and debt.  Launched under a new entity called Arrington XRP Capital, the fund claims to be the first that will require all limited partners (LPs) to make investments in XRP, the cryptocurrency that powers San Francisco startup Ripple's RippleNet software. The fund will also use XRP for all distributions and fees.  However, most notable about the debut may be that Arrington emphasized how it marks what he considers the next phase of his career, one that has already seen him found TechCrunch, one of the most successful internet-era media startups, as well as CrunchFund, a venture fund with 55 exits to date.  Arrington told CoinDesk:  ""In the last several months, I've gone from crypto enthusiast to 100 percent crypto. I've only been looking at crypto deals. This is what I think I'll be doing the rest of my career.""  Far from a bubble, Arrington said he believes that the $300 billion cryptocurrency market represents only the beginning of a larger and more diverse ecosystem of assets.  ""I seriously think that we'll be in the trillions next year, and that we'll start to see institutional money,"" he continued. ""I think next year you'll see significant gains.""  Joining Arrington in the fund will be Heather Harde, a former CEO of TechCrunch, as well as two other unnamed partners. Arrington said that the fund has $50 million committed to date, with an eye to close it before the year's end.  Given the nature of the fund itself, however, he noted that he is targeting a more specialized demographic of existing cryptocurrency investors.  As opposed to the new buyers enticed by the rising values of bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies, Arrington said he's looking to attract the ""large number"" of wealthy individuals with already significant holdings in the market.  ""If they want to invest in a hedge fund, they have to convert to fiat, then the hedge fund will convert it into crypto for investments. With this, you can do a quick swap,"" he said.  Secret sauce  Yet, in an interview, Arrington credited the launch, in part, to the idea that venture funds are ""not ideal"" for crypto investments, given the approval process they need to conduct with LPs.  He also went on to frame the fund's use of Ripple's XRP token as one that would improve on the existing cryptocurrency hedge fund model by easing pain points.  One of the most notable issues, he said, is how such hedge funds typically take investments in fiat currencies, only to have to then invest bitcoin or ether in a new cryptocurrency launch.  ""We think XRP is a particularly useful currency because of the transaction times,"" he said. ""I think it makes a lot of sense to denominate a hedge fund in a cryptocurrency, the only downside is [potential] volatility against fiat.""  In return, Arrington said he hopes the fund's size will encourage a further diversification of cryptocurrency use in the token sales that often bootstrap these efforts.  For example, he framed the market as overly reliant on bitcoin and ether, the two largest assets by market capitalization, and his fund as one that is staking its claim on a solution.  He concluded:  ""I think investors are maybe heavier in bitcoin and ether than they should be.""

42400720,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKS4z,1511898621,"Bitcoin Cash Demand Shocked Us, Says Circle Trading Chief","The pace at which bitcoin cash – the cryptocurrency that forked off the main bitcoin blockchain earlier this year – gained trading volume was ""shocking,"" according to Circle's head of trading.  Speaking during a panel at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest event in New York, Circle's Dan Matuszewski noted that the startup – which operates a trading desk and today unveiled a new investment-oriented app slated for release next year – was taken aback by the trading demand around bitcoin cash after it went live in early August.  ""Bitcoin Cash got liquid and tradeable instantly, which was shocking to us. It was born out of nowhere … [and] became one of the biggest products we traded,"" he said.  Matuszewski spoke alongside Adam White, head of Coinbase's GDAX digital asset exchange; Michael Sonnenshein, GrayScale Investment director of sales and business development; and Hu Liang, founder of Omniex. The panel was moderated by Alex Sunnarborg, co-founder of Tetras Capital.  The panel – in part an introduction to the cryptocurrency industry for mainstream investors – focused on some of the challenges and considerations faced by those firms seeking to offer such services. Among those: assessing the legal standing of a particular token ahead of providing tools or resources around it.  On the question of demand among those investors, panelists spoke to what they characterized as a shifting landscape in which institutions are expressing interest – albeit cautiously.  ""I think the narrative around this has really changed over the last 12 to 18 months,"" Sonnenshein said.  GDAX's White notably offered insight into the make-up of its user base.  ""Largely by user count, most customers tend to be retail,"" he told attendees, noting that the trading volume itself is primarily driven by institutional-level customers.  According to Liang, the market remains a nascent one where the institutional investors in question are still largely on the sidelines.  ""We haven't reached escape velocity yet,"" he said.

Dubbed the AlphaPoint Public Network (APN), the initiative is the latest from AlphaPoint, which to date has focused on creating white-label products for exchanges and, more recently, organizers of initial coin offerings (ICOs).  With the new network, the company is eyeing demand for ways to create and exchange digital versions of tangible assets. AlphaPoint will hold a public sale with the network's associated token, scheduled to happen early next year.  The APN, the company announced today, will be built using Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGXs), or technology that can be used to close off certain types of sensitive data (typically private keys in the case of blockchains). In October, AlphaPoint had announced that it was working with Intel on a security-focused asset solution.  The announcement also comes as AlphaPoint names a new chief executive. Salil Donde previously served as an executive vice president for Nasdaq's Global Information Services, working in that capacity since early 2015. Before working for Nasdaq, Donde was CEO of analytics startup Lewtan, which was sold to Moody's in 2014.  In addition to being AlphaPoint's new CEO, Donde is also joining its board of directors.

42400701,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKRrD,1511894804,Bitcoin Wallet App Abra Adds Support For Ethereum,"Bitcoin wallet app Abra is adding support for ethereum, the startup announced today.  The move to include the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in its list of currencies was unveiled at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest event in New York. According to founder and former Netscape director Bill Barhydt, the ethereum option will be available within the week, alongside bitcoin and dozens of government-issued currencies.  In addition to ethereum, Abra is also beefing up its wallet app's storage capabilities, allowing users to hold multiple currencies at a given time.  As Barhydt explained:  ""You can store access to ethereum and store three different wallets at the same time, so dollars, bitcoin and ethereum all at the same time. And we believe this is the first time this has all been possible in a non-custodial wallet.""  The wallet app maker – which came out of stealth mode in 2015 and raised a $12 million Series A funding round that fall – is also moving to add support for multi-signature transactions as well.  Abra currently uses a single signature model, by which a user signs transactions with their associated private key. By using a ""two-of-two"" multi-sig wallet, both the user and the app would have to greenlight on any transactions before they are broadcast.  Later next year, Abra will expand on this feature, adding a ""two-of-three"" model backed by a third-party oracle service that can sign in the place of either the user or Abra itself.  ""It really is directly responding to consumer requests for more and better things in the Abra app, and we're excited to give them what they want,"" he told CoinDesk.

Dubbed the Blockchain Interoperability Alliance, the effort is being backed by Aion, ICON and Wanchain in a bid to advance standards that would, as envisioned, promote a greater degree of connectivity between different blockchains.  ""We believe that collaborating across projects will help set best practices for blockchain interoperability and encourage broader market adoption across enterprises and the public,"" Matt Spoke, CEO of blockchain startup Nuco and founder of AION, said in a statement.  That question of interoperability – a challenge with decentralized networks governed by their own code and economics – has been cited in other standards pushes, as well as efforts at some of the more enterprise-facing projects, including the Linux Foundation-backed Hyperledger and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.  Indeed, the new group will be dedicating time and effort to push forward with research in this area, including work on how to transact and communicate between blockchains.  ""The goal of this alliance is to create a globally accepted standard for connecting blockchains, and to bring innovations together,"" said J. H. Kim, a council member for the ICON Foundation.

42400703,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKRtB,1511884856,XBRL Reporting Standard Co-Founder Joins Blockchain Startup,"Blockchain startup Auditchain has added the co-founder of a widely used business reporting standard to its leadership team.  The new hire, Eric Cohen, will serve as head of XBRL architecture for the New York-based firm, as announced today at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest event.  Auditchain is developing an accounting ecosystem centered around blockchain-based tokens, and utilizing one of its own (called AUDT) that will serve as a means to access and pay for services.  Cohen is perhaps best known as the co-founder of XBRL, a reporting standard required by business regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and similar agencies in Europe and abroad. He also spent more than 17 years working for professional services firm PwC.  Auditchain co-founder Jason Meyers told CoinDesk that Cohen's involvement traces back to an event at Rutgers University that focused on continuous auditing.  ""I was ecstatic when I met him, and for him to join us totally vindicates what we're doing,"" he said.  In an email to CoinDesk, Cohen framed his work with blockchain as part of a broader, decades-long focus on auditing technology.  ""Leveraging [blockchain]/DLT technologies to provide a fantastic new foundation, enabled by layers of abstraction, can enable new payment channels, and securely hook in resources of all sorts,"" he wrote, adding:  ""It's really not new theory; it goes back to the 60s, just fleshing out the tools that makes it practical. ""  That Cohen would link up with Auditchain is perhaps unsurprising, given his stated interest in blockchain technology and related commentary on platforms like Twitter.  According to his personal website, Cohen has also played a role in the development of standards around blockchain, including an ongoing effort spearheaded by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

42400708,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKRy6,1511883948,Early Bitcoin Buyers Talk Bubbles at Consensus: Invest,"""I think it's very important to make a distinction between a bubble and a fraud.""  So says Glenn Hutchins, the co-founder of private equity firm Silver Lake and one of the panelists this morning during CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest event.  Appearing alongside Galaxy Investment Partners CEO Michael Novogratz and Brian Kelly Capital founder Brian Kelly, his remarks came during a wide-ranging discussion that touched on the valuation of tokens, the future of the industry and how both Hutchins and Novogratz first became involved with bitcoin.  For Novogratz – a long-time investor in bitcoin and ethereum who has predicted significant price gains over the next year – the “eureka” moment occurred once he and his partners began to investigate the technology more deeply, after initial purchases.  ""So we went from owning BTC to investing in the ecosystem,"" he said.  Hutchins quipped that he ""bought BTC only as a last resort,"" noting that he initially looked at the mining space as a possible place to invest – but in his own words, he ""couldn't figure out who was going to win."" Hutchins, as reported last year, later went on to become a board member for industry investment firm Digital Currency Group.  Yet the bulk of the conversation turned on two approaches to investing in cryptocurrencies: either the assets themselves or the companies working to build products and services around them. As Novogratz noted, it's ""hard"" to find a firm working in the space that would have generated as much as a return compared to simply buying the assets themselves.  Novogratz went on to predict that the ecosystem is set for more proliferation of projects, though he posited that there won't be many ""winners"" for each use case, citing examples like decentralized cloud storage and ride sharing.  ""I don't think you're going to have lots of winners in each use case, but you're going to have lots of different blockchains,"" he said.  As might be expected, the conversation later turned to the argument that cryptocurrencies are either a bubble or a ""fraud"" – the latter argument being advanced most notably by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.  For Hutchins, the ""fraud"" moniker is one that shouldn't be tossed around so lightly.  ""I think it's very important to make a distinction between a bubble and a fraud. Even when there was a bubble, if you bought the best you would have made money,"" he told attendees, adding: ""I did not say this is a bubble.""  ""I think this is going to become the biggest bubble of our lifetime by a longshot,"" Novogratz said in reply, prompting Hutchins to say:  ""I want the record to show I didn't say that.""

42400722,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKS8v,1511883321,"As Bitcoin Prices Soar, Forked Rivals Face Different Paths","Bitcoin's stellar rally close to the $10,000 mark appears to have boosted the prices of its recently forked spin-offs bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin gold (BTG). But can they maintain that momentum?  Rival cryptocurrency bitcoin cash has something of a parasitic relationship with bitcoin, in that it not only benefits from the surge in interest in cryptocurrencies due to BTC's astonishing price rally, but it also does see gains in bouts of correction to bitcoin prices.  Bitcoin cash has gained 416 percent from Sept. lows near $300, while the parent cryptocurrency has gained 235 percent over the same period. However, on a year-to-date basis, bitcoin is up almost 900 percent. It remains to be seen if bitcoin cash can surpass that benchmark before its first anniversary on Aug. 1, 2018.  Bitcoin cash clocked a record high above $2,400 earlier this month. As of writing, it is changing hands at $1,600; down 3 percent in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.  Meanwhile, bitcoin gold is less than a month old, but that didn't stop it from recently leaping confidently into the rankings as the fifth largest cryptocurrency. However, as we discussed yesterday, bitcoin gold is finding little love in the investor community which has cited a lack of use cases, and looks currently to be overvalued.  While prices have risen over the last week, BTG is now losing altitude as expected – nursing a 7 percent drop in the last 24 hours, and trading at $335 levels at press time.  The chart analysis points to better days ahead for bitcoin cash, but paints a less glowing picture for bitcoin gold.  Bitcoin cash chart  The chart above shows:  The relative strength index (RSI) has turned lower from the overbought territory (above 70.00), which indicates scope for a healthy pullback.  Still, the outlook remains bullish – as suggested by the string of higher lows marked by trendlines and upward sloping 10-day MA.  View  A convincing break below the 10-day MA would confirm that a near-term top is in place above $1,750. In such a case, prices could test trendline support seen today at $1,250.  On the higher side, a move above $1,750 would open doors for a re-test of $2,000.  Bitcoin gold 4-hour chart  The cryptocurrency looks set to explore sub-$300 levels as discussed yesterday. The relative strength index (RSI) now favors the bears (dropped below 50.00). This could only accentuate bearish pressure around the cryptocurrency.

While BTC is yet to pass the notable milestone on western exchanges, trading in Asia has already seen the cryptocurrency hit as high as $10,086 today on data source CoinMarketCap.  Bitcoin first started peeping above the psychological hurdle on several South Korea-based cryptocurrency exchanges last night.  As per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, however, the cryptocurrency is still trading at $9,917 levels.  That said, the chart analysis shows the dominos are falling, and bitcoin is set to pass the historical price point sooner rather than later.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows:  A minor drop to $9,500 levels yesterday was quickly undone as the cryptocurrency found takers around the upward sloping 50-MA (moving average).  The 50-MA, 100-MA and 200-MA favor further upside in prices (sloping upwards).  More importantly, the rising trendline (drawn from Nov. 12 low and Nov. 24 low) is intact. The trendline is seen offering support today $8,800 levels.  Potential bearish price RSI divergence: The RSI would form lower highs if the current 4-hour candle closes below the 4-hour 50-MA level of $8,625. That would confirm a bearish divergence  View  Bitcoin has potential to extend gains to $10,400 levels, as suggested by the bull flag breakout earlier this month.  The slight cause of concern would be confirmation of the bearish-price RSI divergence. In such a case, the cryptocurrency could witness a deeper pullback to $9,000 levels. However, that may not necessarily yield a trend reversal for two reasons:  In the past, bitcoin has made major tops following the confirmation of the bearish price RSI divergence on the daily chart. A 4-hour bearish divergence is unlikely to yield anything more than a minor pullback.  The outlook remains bullish as long as the rising trend line is intact. Only a break below the trendline support would signal a near-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.

Saying the technology could have possible applications across sectors including customs and immigration, national security and public safety, healthcare, cybersecurity and more, the report suggests that the use of DLT could change the relationship between the government and citizens via its decentralized trust mechanisms.  The U.K. government, the report urges, should prioritize research into DLT's potential to improve decision-making and delivery of public services. Further, ""greater leadership"" from government is needed in research, developing standards, conducting trials and improving cross-departmental collaboration.  Outlining the threats associated with DLT, however, the report argues that the technology is still ""immature,"" stressing the risks from initial coin offerings (ICOs) and ""unresolved issues"" that could pose threat to systems based on the technology.  Lord Christopher Holmes, who led the release of the report, said in a foreword:  ""Our working hypothesis is that DLT can play a valuable part in enhancing the delivery of government services to the citizens of the U.K., in securing the U.K.'s competitive position as a global leader in technology‐based innovation and in protecting the security of government and citizens; data at a time when both are increasingly under threat.""

The trial saw the time taken for document verification reduced from 7–10 days to 2.5 hours.  According to Patxi Fernández de Trocóniz, head of global trade at BBVA, the blockchain pilot marks a ""leap forward"" for effective international trade transactions.  He stated:  ""The time it takes to manage the documentation was reduced to a process that lasted just a few hours, in which all parties – the banks, the importer and the exporter – were constantly aware of the status of the documents.""  The payment of the transaction was carried out using a letter of credit for the transport of 25 tons of frozen tuna, bought from Mexico by a company in Barcelona.  Utilizing blockchain for foreign trade allows the creation of a ""safe and digital environment ... as the foundation for a global foreign trade marketplace,"" says BBVA Bancomer Corporate Banking and Governance head of strategy, Jorge Zebadúa.

42400723,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKS7w,1511856031,"To the Moon? Time to Grow Up, Bitcoin","Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  In this opinion piece, part of a weekly series of columns, Casey suggests that bitcoin’s price might be in a bubble and that curtailing the mania around it would be good for the technology’s future.  This is not ""normal.""  Of course, not being normal is part of bitcoin's appeal. Bitcoin has redefined money and created the hitherto non-existent concept of a scarce digital asset. It’s hard to hold it to the standards of ""normal"" assets.  But as someone who spent decades watching financial markets go through repeated patterns of exuberance and retrenchment, I’m quite uneasy with bitcoin’s latest runup. A 20% gain over the weekend left it up 60% over two weeks and up an eye-popping 900% year-to-date.  Record-breaking gains are irrelevant in isolation. The important question is ""compared to what?"" And the search for an apples-to-apples comparison is especially tricky for an asset class whose binary set of outcomes might lie in an all-or-nothing range of $0 to $1 million.  Cryptocurrencies don't have any real precedent from which to establish benchmarks. That makes them hard to value.  But being hard to value doesn’t get us off the hook. Investors must at least try to assign numbers to the assets they buy. And any rational assessment of something’s value must, by definition, compare it to the value of something else. Value is an inherently relative concept.  Tulips… there, I said it  Here's a value comparison worth thinking about.  Three long weeks ago, when bitcoin was only worth $7,000, Convoy Investments pointed out that, throughout history, the only other price performance for an asset class that exceeded bitcoin’s was the Netherlands’ infamous Tulip Mania of 1619-1622.  As most students of finance know, that one didn’t end so well.    Bitcoin compared to other bubbles. There is only one which surpasses it: the Dutch tulip mania.        The chart is from a newsletter from my long time friends at Convoy investments. If you'd like to subscribe, email them at ir@convoyinvestments.com pic.twitter.com/ZdLSFXcvLn    — The Long View (@HayekAndKeynes) November 8, 2017      While it’s true that resorting to the Tulip Bubble analogy has been a somewhat hackneyed, knee-jerk tool for many bitcoin critics, I think the instinct among many bitcoin bulls to mock them for resorting to it is often similarly simplistic.  William Mallers did it last week in an impassioned rebuttal of financial blogger John Lothian’s criticism of the CME Group’s plan to introduce bitcoin futures.  The problem is that such rebuttals often resort to strawman portrayals of the critic as someone who misunderstands bitcoin’s far-reaching societal potential, as an ignoramus who thinks it’s as worthless as a tulip bulb. This misses the point.  The problem with the tulip bubble wasn’t that the tulip bulbs were worth nothing, it was that a cycle of mania, speculation and FOMO (fear of missing out) pushed their price far out of line with their realizable value. It’s not unreasonable to argue that a similar phenomenon is pushing bitcoin’s price far beyond what’s justified by its unproven potential, conceivably powerful as that might be.  In one of myvery first articles on bitcoin four years ago, I too evoked the Tulip Bubble comparison as the BTC price was then topping $1,200. It turned out to be prescient, as the price shortly thereafter fell to around $200 and then took three years to regain the lost ground. But by then I didn’t care. Writing that column led me to explore cryptocurrencies more deeply.  I became a convert, wrote a book about bitcoin, and ultimately left The Wall Street Journal to join the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT’s Media Lab.  The point is that I’m not alluding to tulips out of Jamie Dimon-like ignorance. I believe, strongly, in cryptocurrency technology, and just as importantly, in its core promise of a superior, more robust and universally acceptable form of money.  It’s just that I also think it’s healthy to separate that inherently hard-to-quantify aspect of its fundamental value to humanity from the particular, fleeting, quantitative expression it finds in the market.  Cult mindset  What worries me most is the cult-like mindset of the investor community, with its ""to the moon"" rallying cries and simplistic justifications for price performance.  The notion, for example, that bitcoin’s in-built scarcity will drive its price higher ad infinitum assumes it operates in some kind of detached vacuum. The ever-present prospect of software forks, while not technically adding to the supply of bitcoin core, points to a wide set of options for investors in the future.  If they find those options more appealing – and who’s to say a better idea won’t come along? – it will matter nothing that only 21 million coins will ever be produced. (For a brutal breakdown of other pro-BTC arguments, readthis critique by the economist Constantin Gurgdiev, who, like me, is a believer in the underlying power of cryptocurrency technology.)  The problem I have with the immaturity of bitcoin’s investing culture is not that it’s setting the market up for a correction. It’s that it constrains progress toward attaining the technology’s more fundamental social value.  Speculation is unavoidable, even useful in bootstrapping innovation. But if bitcoin is to change billions of lives, it needs to become a more mainstream asset class, one that’s connected to the real world that those people occupy. As much as we might all love this quirky, abnormal ""honeybadger of money,"" bitcoin needs to become more normal.  It needs more stability. It needs a two-way market.  That two-way market is coming. And it will be brought to us by financial professionals, hordes of whom will be showing up at CoinDesk’s inaugural Consensus: Invest conference Tuesday. At the same time that venture capitalists and hedge funds are creating investment vehicles to take positive bets on bitcoin and other crypto assets, investment banks and exchanges are creating facilities that will allow other institutions to bet against it.  Futures in bitcoin’s future  The bitcoin bulls who’ve welcomed the CME Group’s plans to introduce bitcoin futures contracts before year-end as an easier way for institutional investors to invest in the sector might want to be more careful what they wish for.  The quarterly-ROI-obsessed fund managers who will trade these contracts share none of quasi-religious mindset of bitcoin HODLers. And now they have a tool, in the futures contracts themselves, with which to short the market.  If it makes sense to do so, they will gladly take actions that drive the price lower. Wall Street is pragmatic, self-interested and obsessed with its short-term bottom line. It doesn’t HODL.  To be sure, it’s not clear how much of an immediate impact futures trading will have on the spot market for bitcoin – the CME’s contracts will be cash-settled, which means that neither counterparty to a trade takes physical ownership of the underlying asset. Investors will merely treat the underlying bitcoin market as a reference.  But as the futures market gains liquidity, and as cross-market hedging strategies become more sophisticated, the futures price on the CME may well become a driver of spot market prices. With such an imbalance between the sizes of the institutional and retail markets, the tail could start wagging the dog.  Here’s the thing: This rite of passage is welcome. By lowering volatility, two-way institutional engagement will increase the impact that bitcoin can have on the world.  It’s an important step in fulfilling bitcoin's purpose. But it also means the moon might have to wait.  Peter Pan image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Michael J.

42400702,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKRsC,1511845305,State Street Vets Net $5 Million for Crypto Startup,"A platform run by former State Street executives that will allow institutional investors to buy a wide range of crypto assets, has raised a $5 million seed round.  Led by Wicklow Capital with the help of Digital Currency Group, Sierra Ventures, Clocktower Ventures and ThirdStream Partners, the round will be used to build out Omniex's suite of tools for buying and selling bitcoin, ether and any other crypto asset deemed a commodity.  According to the former director of State Street's emerging technology lab, now Omniex chief executive, Hu Liang, the startup is looking to help investors buy and sell large amounts of crypto assets by providing a massive pool of liquidity.  And while the startup is now one of an increasing number of companies launching in an effort to intake money entering the crypto space, it looks in good shape to compete.  Liang revealed new details about its founding team including that two other State Street executives have joined Omniex as co-founders: Kamal Mokeddem, who is now head of technology, and John Burnett, who has signed up as the startup's head of business development.  The new investment will be used to continue to round out the startup's team. According to Liang, Omniex will add four more people, mostly developers, soon.  Burnett told CoinDesk:  ""Ultimately, we want to be geared up so that we have the full product set in market by the end of the year, that is designed for the first time as an institutional investment and trading platform.""  Architecture needed  But while the end-of-year deadline could seem tight, the co-founders' backgrounds at State Street should help them lure investors with ""good connections in the capital markets space,"" as Liang said was Omniex's focus.  The platform, called Omniex Portfolio Edge, will initially cater largely to quant hedge funds and specialty crypto funds that focus on cryptocurrencies with large market caps that have been deemed commodities by U.S. regulators.  At launch, the founders hope to have completed their first set of products serving both front and back office operations for trading crypto assets, including a portfolio management platform, risk analytics tools and connectivity to exchanges, voice brokers and electronic streaming engines.  Some of the seed money will also be used for building products for the rest of the trading lifecycle, including fund managers, market makers, exchanges, custodians, fund accountants and online cryptocurrency vaults.  ""We're not a market maker ourselves, we're not an exchange ourselves. So we're looking for anybody who is adding value to the existing ecosystem by bringing in either liquidity or storage mechanisms or regulated activities,"" Liang said, adding:  ""We're the infrastructure for the crypto ecosystem.""  That infrastructure is something some in the cryptocurrency space think is the key to enabling what Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert called the ""next wave of institutional capital,"" in interview with CoinDesk.  ""In order to participate in these markets in a meaningful way, these folks will need “institutional grade” cryptocurrency trading tools,"" Silbert said.  Up next: ICOs  And though the platform will start off limited to cryptocurrencies with large market caps, the co-founders would also like to expand the infrastructure to support smaller assets, such as tokens sold during initial coin offerings (ICOs).  It's not all that surprising, since ICOs are the hot topic in the crypto world, with many thinking the new fundraising mechanism could soon become commonplace. But currently, Omniex doesn't have the regulatory approval to accept ICO tokens that might already be or someday be categorized and regulated as securities.  While startups, such as Templum, and Overstock's tZERO subsidiary are already salivating at the opportunity, so far opportunities are limited.  Liang concluded:  ""For this to be an institutional class, we need this to be a $1 trillion, $2 trillion, $10 trillion industry. We're here to grow that ecosystem.""
