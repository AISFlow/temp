42413327,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8QzC,1672005055,Defrost Finance Hacked in Attack Some Say May Have Been a Rug Pull,"Decentralized-finance protocol Defrost Finance said it was hacked on Friday, though blockchain security firm PeckShield, citing “community intel,” said the exploit may have been a rug pull that made off with $12 million and Certik, another security company, said it had been unable to contact members of the team.  In a tweet thread posted on Sunday, the Defrost team said a first attack used a flash loan to drain funds out of its V2 product. A second larger attack used the owner key to exploit V1. The protocol, which offers leveraged trading on the Avalanche blockchain, didn’t say how much had been taken.  PeckShield’s analysis showed the attack used a fake collateral token together with manipulated pricing.  A rug pull, or exit scam, can occur when developers create and establish a liquidity pool and then remove the funds and disappear after investors have bought the related token. The total value of funds locked on Defrost Finance, which peaked at $95 million in February, was about $13 million in recent weeks, Defi Llama data shows. That dropped to less than $93,000 on Sunday.  If the attack is a rug pull, it's an unusual one. Usually, the team behind the scheme goes silent and can't be contacted. Defrost Finance, however, announced the attack and said in a tweet that it's willing to negotiate with the people responsible for a return of the funds.  Still, an attempt to reach the firm through Twitter failed because direct messages have been disabled on the account. Certik tweeted on Monday that it tried ""to contact multiple members of the team but have had no response."" An accompanying graphic said it confirmed DeFrost as an exit scam.  DeFiYield, which offers a security layer for smart contracts to help investors avoid getting scammed or hacked, said it conducted an audit of Defrost Finance a year ago, and highlighted the smart contract vulnerability used in the hack.     Last year, crypto investors lost over $2.8 billion to rug pulls, according to a report by Chainalysis. Rug pulls accounted for 37% of the over $7.7 billion in total illicit revenue from crypto scams that year. The 2022 figure is likely to be higher: A report from blockchain risk-monitoring firm Solidus Labs shows that fraudsters deployed more than 117,000 scam tokens through Dec. 1, 41% more than in all of 2021.

Related Reading: WAVES Gets Dragged Down By USDN, Despite Pumping Investor Distribution In the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances. Yesterday, we spoke with investment firm Blofin on their perspective on the past, present, and future of crypto. Today, we continue the series with David Schwed, former Global Head of Digital Assets Technology at BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian and securities services provider, and current COO at Halborn. Schwed: “What changed was the reality that too good to be true yields are exactly that, too good to be true. The money needs to come from somewhere, and it turns out that it was coming from risk loans and other business practices that relied on the steady increase of the price of crypto (…).” This major financial institution, along with some of the biggest banks in the U.S., Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, finally embraced cryptocurrencies in 2021 and 2022. Still, recent events in the industry might impact crypto and digital asset adoption for legacy financial institutions. Schwed: “I haven’t seen any slowdown from TradFi when it comes to entering/expanding into the crypto markets.” Traditional Finances (TradFi) and Crypto Finances, in their many forms (CeFi, DeFi, etc.), have been converging. Will the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX push these institutions away from crypto? What is the likeliest regulatory outlook for 2023? We asked this former BNY Mellon executive this and much more. This is what he told us: Q: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid? A: What changed was the reality that too good to be true yields are exactly that, too good to be true. The money needs to come from somewhere, and it turns out that it was coming from risk loans and other business practices that relied on the steady increase of the price of crypto. As the price fell and the loans were due, many faced liquidation of their collateral and margin calls. That being said, we are seeing adoption in many other areas besides finance. Many major retailers are also entering the ecosystem, such as Nike, Matterl, Samsung, and LVMH. Q: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision? A: The narrative today needs to be risk management and security. Had 3AC/Voyager/Celsius and others had more institutional risk management practices, their demise may have been avoided. The same thought goes into security. There is a fundamental difference between crypto native security vs what we see in more mature financial institutions. We need to improve both drastically in order to restore trust. Q: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right? A: The most significant moment was the FTX crash. The progression of SBF from the hero who will save us all to a criminal in a matter of weeks is evidence of the lack of transparency in the ecosystem. We will certainly feel the impact as we head into 2023 . I don’t believe we’ve seen the full impact as it relates to other organizations who have some exposure to FTX or are generally over-leveraged. I believe by the end of 2023 we will be back to where we were in the beginning of 2022 in part due to the institutional/enterprise markets. I’ve heard “Crypto is dead” many times throughout the years and they’ve been wrong every time. While the current situation is much different since the price decline is a result of many systemic failures, the same can be said for many crashes observed in TradFi Wall Street, the most similar being the 2008-2009 crisis and TradFi is still alive and kicking. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Poised To Rally Big-Time On Today’s PCE Release Q: Traditional finances (Tradfi) and crypto are merging in many ways. Will the collapse of FTX affect this trend? And in this context, do you see regulations leaning toward adopting an approach that will halt the integration between legacy and crypto financial companies? A: While the collapse of FTX and the resulting collateral damage has shown to have negatively impacted the crypto market, I haven’t seen any slowdown from TradFi when it comes to entering/expanding into the crypto markets. In fact, many of the G-SIBs (Globally Systemically Important Banks) that I have spoken to have not changed or altered their roadmaps as it relates to crypto. I haven’t seen any indication of regulations halting the integrations between traditional and crypto. That being said, I believe we will see sweeping regulation in the crypto markets similar in size and scope of the Dodd-Frank Act.

42411282,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMfug,1671982200,5 Crypto Things That Riled Me Up in 2022,"Enclosed are just five of the crypto-related things that got under my skin in 2022. There were far more than five, but obvious things like “the market went down” are not included because they’re not fun to write about.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  1. The FTX/Alameda/SBF fraud  This is probably the umpteen-millionth time you have read some version of a crypto person being mad about this, but I’m still mad at FTX (for the fraud), the reckless risk-takers (for the flexing) and many Twitter-ers (for the hero worship). I think the fraud speaks for itself. The embezzlement (or whatever it was) at FTX hurt real people. Rubbing salt in the wound: I got to ask FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried some questions, months before his exchange collapsed, on a CoinDesk TV program, but I failed to touch on anything hard-hitting. We talked about the Super Bowl mostly.  Watch: New FTX Boss Condemns Management of the Crypto Exchange During Sam Bankman-Fried's Tenure  2. Crypto hedge fund founders flexing  My brain is raising at least two pitchforks for the folks at crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). It’s one thing to be a little annoyed with highly leveraged hedge funds (like 3AC) doing risky things in general; it’s another to be annoyed at the associated flexing (i.e., “showing off”) that took place on social media and elsewhere as highly leveraged hedge funds raked in the cash the last few years.  But it was revealed during liquidation proceedings that 3AC co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu paid for a $50 million superyacht with company funds all while flexing that “100K ETH is dust.” Calling 100,000 ether “dust” was calling $400 million “not a lot of money.” 3AC collapsed. Also, the superyacht was named: “Much Wow.”  Yeah, I know.  Much cringe.  3. Parts of Bitcoin maximalism  I think that Bitcoin maximalism, the idea that bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that matters, is fine. Many smart people that I like and respect disagree with me because of the toxic culture it nurtures, but our disagreement isn’t what annoyed me in 2022. What annoyed me is the absolutist language used by maximalism’s adherents. If you don’t understand that you still could be wrong about Bitcoin, then you’re just role-playing as a savior.  Also Bitcoin doesn’t have to be “alive”, as former MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor put it on Twitter. Those who tweet that “Bitcoin is [some random adjective]” are just saying stuff for the sake of saying it. It doesn’t make any sense or mean anything at all. And who cares if ether is a security or not? My take is that Bitcoin maximalism would probably be better served if it lived by the adage: “Bitcoin is. And that is enough.”  4. Overselling the current state of crypto developments  Two weeks ago I complained about Goldman Sachs (GS) co-opting “blockchain” as a buzzword and using it to sell the merits for private blockchain bond issuance. So I’m mad at GS (nothing new here) for selling snake oil.  But I’m also mad at effectively centralized chains, such as Binance Smart Chain, for selling snake oil by acting as if they are broadly decentralized. And at the “Ethereum is ultra-sound money” crowd. And at Decentraland users who are angry at journalists for reporting user numbers. And at bitcoiners overstating the impact of Taro as a monumental development when nothing has been delivered to market yet.  I’m not mad because I think any of these people are wrong. Yes, maybe one day Decentraland will have more than 810 daily active users and maybe one day Taro will bring stablecoins to the masses via Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. But for now, they aren’t. It’s fine to be excited, but I believe that if we want crypto to be taken seriously at all (which I do), then we’d be better served if we stopped overselling how healthy and vibrant the ecosystem is today.  5. Privacy deniers, haters and destroyers  I tweeted earlier this year that this was the “year for privacy.” I don’t think I was correct thematically, but I do want to give more airtime to the importance of privacy as we close out the year.  Privacy is a human right and it should be normalized. So it’s probably unsurprising that privacy deniers also irked me in 2022. We don’t have to look far to see the most recent infringement that had a crypto wrapping on it given U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s recently proposed Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, which is less focused on stopping money laundering than it is on infringing on privacy.  The shortest version of why I think privacy is important goes like this: You don’t need privacy until the exact moment that you do. And if your retort is that it is only criminals who need privacy, do remember that you are not a criminal until the moment that you are.  So to you, privacy deniers, fraudsters and the like, let’s leave all the stuff I don’t like in 2022.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/25/five-crypto-things-that-riled-me-up-in-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c456f841f542261cb5a75c5bee350b799765f21-3363x2572.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s a quick look on how the crypto has been performing: FTX crash drags price down SOL price nosedives by 2.13% $200 million in crypto wiped out from Solana Foundation According to CoinMarketCap, the crypto’s price has nosedived by 2.13% or trading at $11.77 as of this writing. Evidently, it has been negative for the past few days, although there has been improvements but it still isn’t peaking to $12. With the rate it’s going, the price is seen to have depreciated by as much as 1.56% as seen in the past 24 hours.

More so, apart from the mobile device, the platform will also be launching JumpCrypto’s Fire Dancer which will also be released in 2023.

Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX former CEO, is facing multiple charges of fraud. He posted a $250 million bail last week. The coin is now down by 69% since November as impacted by the FTX collapse which is known to be one of the biggest supporters of Solana. The recent collapse of FTX has also dragged the crypto down, especially with the Solana Foundation having approximately $200 million worth of crypto wiped out when FTX imploded. With the current scenario, there is a very slim chance of the crypto enjoying a price increase in the next coming weeks, even if the digital asset has bottomed out.
