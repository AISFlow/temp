42433010,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2dLh,1604009990,Uniswap's $40M Governance Vote Closes on Halloween and Some UNI Holders Fear for Price,"Should users who interacted with Uniswap through a third-party interface be entitled to the free UNI tokens other users received on Sept. 17?      That's the question at the center of a dispute currently taking place in Uniswap governance channels. The second-ever proposal to come before the Uniswap community would distribute airdropped UNI tokens to another 12,619 addresses, ahead of a second proposal set for nearly 27,000 addresses.      As of this writing, over 20.7 million UNI have been voted in favor of the proposal and more than 714,000 have been voted against. The vote closes on Oct. 31 at roughly 8:00 UTC.      While the vote may look extremely lopsided at the moment, the proposal will fail if less than 40 million UNI vote, establishing a quorum. The key obstacle to passage is probably reaching that threshold.      The decision is widely interesting enough to the crypto community that it's inspired a betting market on Polymarket, which currently leans toward the pitch for further UNI distributions failing.      If both proposals succeed, however, an additional 15,679,200 UNI would be distributed from the existing treasury, worth approximately $40.6 million, at the current price of $2.59 per UNI. Of that, 5,047,600 UNI would be redistributed from the treasury in phase one.    400 UNI, 40,000 more times    When the company behind Ethereum's leading automated market maker, Uniswap, announced its governance token, UNI, in September, it surprised everyone by giving away 400 UNI to all wallets that had ever even used the decentralized application. Directly, that is.      At the time, each airdrop was worth well over $1,000.      Read more: Uniswap's Distribution Is Built on Something That Can't Be Forked: Actual Users      As a governance token, each UNI can be used to vote on decisions about changes to the dapp and also on expenditures from the Uniswap treasury, which has a supply of 430 million UNI or 43% of the initial supply.      The proposal under consideration now, and the one that will follow, concerns giving the airdrop to people who missed out on the gravy train through a technicality.      These individuals interacted with Uniswap using third-party software that enabled the transaction, touching Uniswap by way of a proxy contract. That made each of their wallets invisible to Uniswap itself. As the proponents of the proposal have argued: If decentralized finance (DeFi) is about money legos, what message does it send if only users of the base lego get the free crypto?      The current proposal centers on users who interacted with Uniswap via 10 different dapps – the largest being MyEtherWallet (MEW), Argent and Dharma, in that order.      Phase two involves users who interacted with Uniswap via decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators. Five DEX aggregators represent 26,598 accounts, with the largest by far on the Kyber Network.    Lots of talk    The idea of a retroactive airdrop was raised almost as soon as UNI was announced by Nadav Hollander, CEO of DeFi portal Dharma. Hollander has said that as soon as people started receiving UNI, Dharma users began saying they were missing out.      ""Ultimately the crux of the argument we are making is that the status quo has sort of negatively punished developers who took risks building on top of Uniswap,"" Nadav Hollarnder of Dharma said during a group discussion hosted by Chris Blec, on his YouTube show, Thought Bubble.      In a Twitter thread, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams acknowledged the team was aware that some users might feel left out. That's why Uniswap decided to leave future decisions about further distributions to UNI holders, Adams said, in part because it is hard to distinguish actual users from the many bots who also use Uniswap at a remove.      Additionally, there's no way to know how many users of the 15 applications listed on the governance proposals may have already received the airdrop because of interacting with Uniswap directly through another wallet.      SpankChain CEO and MolochDAO summoner Ameen Soleimani wrote on the Uniswap forum that the proposal illustrates what a dangerous time-suck governance disputes can become.      ""The outcome is also fairly zero-sum,"" Soleimani wrote, adding:    ""1) it doesn't create any wealth for UNI holders, it 2) takes UNI from the treasury that could be spent on other things and 3) gives it to folks who will likely sell it, probably having a small negative price impact.""    The debate has caused an emerging class of protocol politicians to weigh in on the matter.""I would like to see this gigantic stimulus package-like situation, where we are going to fund 15 or 20 different projects, to be reframed like a development grant on an individual basis,"" one such blockchain populist, Hiturunk, leader of the Penguin Party, said during the call with Hollander.",NEUTRAL,UNI,KNC | REGULATION | TRADING | UNI | AIRDROP,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/29/uniswaps-40m-governance-vote-closes-on-halloween-and-some-uni-holders-fear-for-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74f5ab1b25ffe7d3b0f88ce34c24679c0fff9e9b-1920x1150.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The BCH hard fork expected Nov. 15 is a result of a blockchain update proposal in August from a group known as Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCH ABC), led by Amaury Sechet.  Among other changes, Sechet and his team plan to introduce a new “Coinbase Rule,” which requires 8% of mined BCH to be redistributed to Bitcoin ABC as a means of financing protocol development.  This change is, however, opposed by Roger Ver, executive chairman of mining pool Bitcoin.com and the Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN).  “Diverting part of the #BitcoinCash block reward to pay a single development team is a Soviet style central planner’s dream come true,” Ver wrote in a tweet. “Please stop.”  OKEx said Oct. 28 in a post on its website that in the event of a successful fork, holders of BCH will receive two new assets, BCH ABC and BCHN.  “After the fork is completed, we will refer to the trading prices of the forked currency pairs on major exchanges and select the chain with the higher price to inherit the BCH name. The tokens of the other chain will be airdropped to users' funding accounts at a 1:1 ratio.”  Futures and perpetual swaps on BCH will “follow one of the forks,” according to the document.  “In principle, the underlying asset of the post-fork contracts will be the more expensive post-fork asset, determined by the post-fork spot market on various major crypto exchanges,” it added.  As of press time, of the last 1,000 blocks mined on Bitcoin Cash, about 70% have signaled support for BCHN, and only 0.2% for Bitcoin ABC, according to data from Coin Dance.  OKEx CEO Jay Hao told CoinDesk in a Telegram message that the two groups “hold very different ideas about the proposed miner tax.”  “OKEx understands that in the blockchain space, core developers have differences of opinion over the best way to fund development, growth, continued innovation, and future direction,” Hao said. “Of course, it's always preferable when an agreement can be reached and a change implemented via a soft fork.”  All withdrawal activities on OKEx remain suspended after the exchange said earlier this month that a holder of a private key needed to authorize withdrawals had been out of touch while “cooperating with a public security bureau in investigations.”  The Chinese news source Caixin reported that an OKEx founder, Mingxing “Star” Xu, had been taken into police custody.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | FORKS,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/29/okex-still-paralyzed-by-founders-arrest-details-plans-for-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c5b4b7faffd493882c45650fe2cb895519924e4-1500x848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We are almost at new highs for open interest for all BTC futures - $5.4 billion right now,” noted Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin. “With many new positions being opened, it suggests the market is still bullish at these prices,” Lau added.      “That said, there are a considerable amount of order book 'asks' in the $14,000 region for bitcoin,” Lau said. “Bitcoin should close above that level on a weekly or monthly basis to confirm it is acting as support.""    Ether options in December pile up    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether was up Wednesday trading around $389 and climbing 1.1% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The amount of open interest on ether options for December expiration hit 500,000 ETH, worth $195,500,00 as of press time, as traders make bets on the dynamics of the Ethereum network.      Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, noted that a lot of ether options bets seem bearish. “It looks like there's some strong ETH put buying going on into the year end mainly around the mid-low $200s,” he said. Indeed, data aggregator Genesis Volatility shows strikes amassing around the $200-$280 price points.      “I think people are buying the downside for some reason,” Shah added. “It definitely throws water on the narrative that Ethereum 2.0 would create a supply shock in Ethereum 1.0 due to the initial lock-up - perhaps it is something else, but it's definitely hard to glean any bullish implications.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed, mostly red Thursday.

42433012,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2dHh,1603993556,'Flash Loans' Have Made Their Way to Manipulating Protocol Elections,"Flash loans can be used for more than just siphoning funds out of poorly put-together decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.      That’s one lesson investors can learn from Israel-based startup BProtocol’s manipulation of flash loans to sway election results on DeFi legacy project MakerDAO earlier this week.      According to the MakerDAO community forum, on October 26, BProtocol borrowed 13,000 MKR tokens worth some $7 million through a flash loan from derivatives platform dYdX swapped for MKR on lending platform Aave. Voting with the flash-loaned MKR tokens enabled BProtocol to speed up desired election results for its project built on MakerDAO.      The “attack” was less an attack than yet another unexpected consequence of flash loans, a crypto-first product that made its debut in early 2020 with DeFi platform Aave.      Read more: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the DeFi ‘Flash Loan’ Attack  Flash loans enable an in-the-know trader to amass mad leverage behind a trade by providing a temporary loan that must execute and settle in one block space. Here – and perhaps for the first time – BProtocol borrowed millions of MKR tokens to sway a protocol election and hand back the money in one block.      Other DeFi degens have used flash loans to perform what is commonly known as an oracle attack. In these situations a project’s funds are at risk due to poor project infrastructure – typically, shoddy pricing feeds. This happened last Sunday with $1 billion protocol Harvest Finance, which had prices for its stablecoin pools swayed by a flash loan, resulting in a haircut for Harvest traders.    Flash votes    The ability to use flash loans to exploit governance events is fairly new, however. Holders of MakerDAO’s governance token typically decide how the platform changes.      But here BProtocol showed that if there are enough MKR tokens up for borrowing on DeFi markets, a flash loan can be used by just about anyone to sway Maker’s election results. All someone needs to do is wait to be last in line at the ballot and drop in the borrowed tokens, BProtocol CEO Yaron Velner said in a WhatsApp call.      Velner added he thinks the Maker Foundation was aware of the unlocked door BProtocol went through with its flash loan, and that the outcome of the vote would have likely been the same.      He said the team had been waiting extra days to be whitelisted for using MakerDAO’s pricing oracles and had become “curious” after months of studying Maker’s infrastructure to see if the flash loan was possible. So they decided to play a bit.      Read more: MakerDAO’s Embrace of Centralized Stablecoins Offers Risks and Rewards      Now MakerDAO community members and the Maker Foundation are considering options for “disincentivizing large MKR Holders from providing MKR Liquidity on Lending Platforms and AMM Platforms” until MakerDAO can blacklist votes using flash loans, according to the MakerDAO forum.      In lieu of comment, the Maker Foundation pointed CoinDesk to a community forum discussion from October 6 on limiting the use of flash loans for governance procedures.",NEGATIVE,MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | MKR,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/29/flash-loans-have-made-their-way-to-manipulating-protocol-elections,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e1adadbba2d7246febb3b782e21cc0f138785dd-1194x817.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Audius occupies a similar space to popular music players like Pandora or Spotify, but it allows artists to set their own terms. It also lets other developers make use of its underlying content. Audius reports strong recent growth in users, currently boasting 800,000 active users and over 150,000 tracks available for streaming.      Due to high gas fees and slow block times on Ethereum, it appears to be porting season in the dapp space. We previously reported on Terra, Kin and USDC moving onto Solana. Similarly, the automated market maker and pooled assets manager Balancer has been incentivizing efforts to help it offer services on other networks, such as Oasis and NEAR.      In an announcement shared with CoinDesk in advance, the Audius team wrote:    ""Given our need to utilize a high-performance blockchain today, Solana's growing set of 182 validators (as of this writing) combined with a battle-tested architecture gives our community the confidence that Audius's catalog can scale at ease, a crucial component of our path to mainstream adoption.""    Notably, when Kin announced its move to Solana in June, it also announced an incentive arrangement with Solana that would unlock grants of SOL tokens for each million users Kin brought in over a 24-month period.      Audius CEO Roneil Rumburg declined to disclose the exact arrangement with Solana, stating that it was primarily a technical consideration.

Staking and governance functionality will remain on Ethereum.

Prosecutors allege Rufrano hid employment at two law firms, three companies and a university while also collecting long-term disability benefits from the Federal Reserve System for five years after departing due to a “purported” mental illness.  CoinDesk found at least two of Rufrano’s jobs intersected with cryptocurrency and the blockchain ecosystem. He directed Stanford’s digital currency group and also advised Factom, a now-defunct protocol development firm. Rufrano is also listed as an adviser to Christopher Giancarlo's Digital Dollar Project.  The Stanford Future of Digital Currency Initiative researches “all forms” of digital currency with the aim of standardizing their technicals and engaging government stakeholders, according to its current website. It boasts Ripple and IBM as corporate sponsors. Rufrano last appears as its executive director in an Oct. 25 cached version of the website.  Rufrano also led the Stanford School of Engineering’s Advanced Financial Technologies Lab. He managed that AI-focused program's relationships with banks and fund managers, according to the criminal complaint.  Stanford did not immediately return questions regarding its ties to Rufrano.

42433019,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2dXh,1603989282,Bitcoin Transaction Fees Rise to 28-Month High as Hashrate Drops Amid Price Rally,"The cost of doing transactions on bitcoin is surging while the network suffers its worst congestion in nearly three years.      As of Wednesday, the mean fee per transaction, or the average transaction cost, was 0.00086764 BTC, the highest since June 2018, according to data source Glassnode. In dollar terms, the average transaction fee was $11.66.      Average fees in bitcoin terms have increased by 573% in the past 12 days alongside the cryptocurrency’s price rally from $11,200 to $13,800.      ""Bitcoin mempool [memory pool] is back in focus in the wake of rising transaction volumes, causing congestion in the network and consequently driving fees higher,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, told CoinDesk.      Mempool is the collection of unconfirmed transactions. When bitcoin transactions are executed, they are first sent to the mempool, where they wait for approval by miners. Bitcoin miners can process only 1 megabyte (MB) worth of transactions per block mined roughly every 10 minutes.      When the blockchain experiences a rise in traffic, it causes delays and a backlog of transactions. As demand outstrips supply, miners increase their revenue by prioritizing transactions with higher fees. That, in turn, forces other users to offer higher fees to avoid long waiting times.      Network congestion is usually seen during price rallies. As noted earlier, bitcoin has chalked out a significant rise over the past 12 days. During that time frame, network congestion, as measured by the total number of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, worsened by 1,800%.      As of Tuesday, there were 121,340 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool with a total block size of 66.8 MB. According to data source blockchain.com, that's the highest level since the bull market frenzy of December 2018.    Hashrate drop contributes to congestion    The recent slide in bitcoin's hashrate looks to have played a big role in causing network congestion along with a general price-driven pickup in activity. In other words, the mining power dedicated to approving transactions and mining blocks has gone down amid the price rally, boosting waiting times and network congestion.      The seven-day moving average of bitcoin's hashrate has declined from 146 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 120 EH/s.      In other words, the mining power available to approving transactions and mining blocks has gone down amid the price rally, boosting waiting times and network congestion.      With the end of the rainy season in China's Sichuan province, a mining hub, some miners may be shifting to other areas with cheap hydroelectricity sources, causing a drop in the hashrate.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/29/bitcoin-transaction-fees-rise-to-28-month-high-as-hashrate-drops-amid-price-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/318516e3f983cd49c443e5a4889345977bb47bc9-1257x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Coinbase predicts its consumer-directed debit card to hit shelves next year. Caitlin Long’s Avanti bank is in line to become the second “crypto bank.”    Top shelf    Fractional offering You can now trade high-demand stocks like Tesla, Apple and Amazon, represented by tokens, on the FTX derivatives exchange. Through its fractional stocks offering, 12 equity and cryptocurrency pairs will be offered, allowing users to trade tokenized fractions of stocks (seemingly up to half a stock at a time) against bitcoin and stablecoins, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports. The product is conducted in partnership with capital markets solutions provider Digital Assets AG and investment firm CM Equity. FTX calls it a “first of its kind” product.      Coinbase card Coinbase’s debit card is coming to U.S. consumers sometime next year. Active for nearly a year in the U.K. and European Union, the card will become available in all U.S. states except Hawaii. Any cryptocurrencies that Coinbase supports in the U.S. (and that users hold in their accounts) can be spent through the debit card – with rewards paid in lumens or bitcoin. The card is issued by South Dakota-based MetaBank and powered by payments platform Marqeta, though users will manage it directly through their Coinbase accounts, according to CoinDesk banking whisperer Nathan DiCamillo.      Avast ye? No, avanti! Speaking of banks: Blockchain pioneer Caitlin Long is now the CEO of her own special purpose depository institution (SPDI) in Wyoming. Avanti Financial’s banking charter was approved unanimously by the Wyoming State Banking Board on Wednesday, becoming the second newly chartered bank in the state in 2020. Kraken Financial earned approval last month, beating Long – who helped design the state’s rules – to the draw. Avanti is now in the process of raising fresh capital, adding to a $5 million angel round, before it can be granted a certificate of authority to operate, DiCamillo said.      Token sale The Graph, a data-indexing protocol used by many popular decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, has raised $12 million in a public sale of its native GRT token, CoinDesk’s Zack Seward reports. With approximately 4,500 buyers, the sale used in-house technology to distribute some 400 million GRT tokens. “What we’re excited about with the sale is getting GRT tokens in the hands of indexers, curators and delegators that are going to be participating in the decentralized network,” The Graph co-founder Yaniv Tal said. The firm previously raised $5 million in a private token sale involving Coinbase Ventures and a $2.5 million seed round led by Multicoin Capital.      Four-digit growth Publicly traded digital-asset brokerage Voyager Digital saw revenue increase 1,159% (from $87,318 to $1.1 million) in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole also reports, customer assets jumped by 1,959% to $35 million. Stephen Ehrlich, Voyager CEO, said increasing adoption of digital assets has helped the company extend its growth momentum. Up next? Revenue is expected to have risen to $2 million in the July-September period while the firm looks to obtain a virtual currency license, or “BitLicense,” this year.

(Decrypt)  Market intel    Bloody chance Traders are betting bitcoin won’t cross its 2017 high-water mark of $20,000 by year’s end. According to data source Skew, there’s a 6% probability of bitcoin trading above the historical 2017 all-time high. “Bitcoin’s price has rallied from $3,867 to $13,800 over the past 7½ months. However, while prices have risen by over 250%, the chances of bitcoin reaching record highs by the end of the year have seen what appears to be a marginal rise from 4% to 6%. The probability peaked at 8% in July,” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports.    At stake    Tokens rising (Happy Halloween) Following the pop of initial coin offering bubble that began in 2017 and tapered off in 2018, many looked at token offerings skeptically. Although a more democratic way to raise funds, this novel blockchain-based fundraising mechanism ran into a host of problems: many were potentially unregistered securities sales for projects not-yet built and unlikely to gain traction.      In 2018, Satis Group released a report detailing that approximately 78% of ICOs were Identified Scams, or projects that “did not have/had no intention of fulfilling project development duties with the funds, and/or was deemed by the community (message boards, website or other online information) to be a scam.”      A similar overview from Boston College largely backed up these claims.      That’s why in 2020 it’s surprising to see token sales are on the up and up, although with a few notable changes. This past summer, Leigh Cuen reported that “token sales are back.”      “Unlike 2017, today the norm is for token sales to be conducted through an exchange, whether it’s CoinList, Gate.io or Binance,” she wrote. Additionally, projects now lean into controlled distribution. Unlike the original ETH sale in 2015, and the 2017 copycats that followed, many token founders now prefer ongoing sales with controlled distribution – meaning geofencing regions (like the U.S.) where investments may prove to be an issue.      Halfway through the past year Ava Labs’s Avalanche blockchain raised roughly $42 million in a public token sale. Polkadot, one of the largest blockchains, raised $43 million in a private sale days later. And NEAR, another layer 1, brought in $30 million. Then there’s Dapper Labs, which closed an $18 million token sale in early October      Notably, all these projects had already raised significant venture funding, often conducting a private sale, before turning around to publicly list their tokens on a gated platform that manages know-your-customer information and compliance.      The Graph is the latest project to join the trend of high-value public token sales to close this year. Following a similar set of stringent rules and capital caps, The Graph is different in choosing to use in-house technologies – rather than the suite of hosting platforms.      The verdicts out on what, if anything, will buck the trend. But for now, it’s safe to say, token sales are back.

42433011,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2dJh,1603986781,Crypto and Fintech Share Goals: They Should Talk,"Everyone agrees: Financial infrastructure is broken. We need a way to make cash flows deterministic. We should be able to set rules around trades and transfers. We should be able to do this without bloated back offices performing manual reconciliations and without requiring developers to integrate across an entire fragmented universe of systems built on COBOL and teetering on top of mainframes.      The race is on to solve these issues. On one team, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs are taking a first-principles approach, starting with completely new assets and new infrastructure in order to get “programmable money.” On another team, fintech builders are tackling the problem by building around the systems that already exist: Simple APIs will grant us “autonomous finance.” Both approaches promise a new day for the retail experience of finance, but they are taking very different paths to get there.    Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.    Programmable money is the aim of many cryptocurrency protocols and the goal of many applications built on Ethereum. Because cryptocurrencies are issued, owned, traded and settled in a natively digital form, they are able to be manipulated directly by code. Escrow terms, credit events, multiparty ownership and all manner of other interactions and behaviors can be enshrined in smart contracts. Again, the goal here is to replace the old intermediated and inefficient financial system that exists today. Projects like Compound are tackling this in money markets, Cozy in risk management and Uniswap in exchange.      Autonomous finance, on the other hand, does not seek to reinvent the system altogether. Rather, the aim is to build into and among the legacy infrastructure of finance, crafting middleware that enables money management to become “smart” and money movement to feel fast, even when running on old rails. Those taking this approach recognize that sometimes the most practical road to the future is actually just a patching and repaving of the asphalt.    While the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem has much more revolutionary aims over the long run, the immediate goals of the programmable money crowd are very much aligned with those of autonomous finance.    Plaid, which Visa has agreed to buy for $5.3 billion, is arguably the original in this category: enabling customers to make their financial data available to fintechs like neobanks, lenders and savings tools. Following Plaid, API tools have come along to tackle just about every vertical of someone’s financial life: their credit score, their payroll, their student loans, their insurance contracts. While Plaid is “read only,” many of these tools now offer read and write access, enabling fintech companies to make withdrawals and deposits from accounts programmatically.      While the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem has much more revolutionary aims over the long run, the immediate goals of the programmable money crowd are very much aligned with those of autonomous finance. We should be able to create or copy rulesets for our financial lives and let them run and optimize themselves. All of our bank accounts and financial products should be able to transact against each other without our involvement. Checking account running low and rent payment due? Your savings account should automatically cover it. Took out a loan and need to post collateral? Your brokerage account should be able to do so without even the touch of a button. Money should be self-driving.      See also: Jill Carlson - What Goldman Gets Wrong About Bitcoin (From Someone Who Used to Work There)      Given the overlap of goals here, it is surprising to see that these two sides – decentralized finance and fintech APIs – rarely meet. Investors in crypto could learn many lessons from those in fintech who are deep in the weeds of what is practical and realistic within the constraints of the current system. Conversely, mainstream fintech investors may find compelling opportunities within the enormous, disruptive dream of cryptocurrency. Builders, too, would benefit.      Cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and protocol developers might find that they are already using (and could benefit from further leveraging) the APIs and tools being developed in the world of fintech. And fintech builders may find their minds opened to larger horizons by spending a bit of time down the crypto rabbit hole.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/29/crypto-and-fintech-share-goals-they-should-talk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b39abee50fc21746fb29e817cce9ee4a3e75b95-1350x901.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432993,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2czh,1603980346,All-In on DeFi: Why the Days of Centralized Exchanges Are Numbered,"DeFi, or decentralized finance, finally found its footing this year, with numerous DeFi tokens and protocols gaining widespread traction amongst crypto users. Powered by smart contract technology, innovations like yield farming have allowed everyday users to earn unprecedented interest on their crypto assets.      DeFi is booming, and today the market is filled with all kinds of borrowing and lending protocols, many of which compete with one another on the basis of providing users with meteoric yields. It’s not uncommon to see protocols advertising double or triple digit interest rates – a far cry from the ~0.5% interest rates commonly seen on so-called “high-yield” traditional savings accounts. While many of these protocols will prove to be unsustainable, make no mistake: Look back in a few years, and it’ll be clear this emergent wave of protocols have set larger forces into motion.    Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao is the founder and CEO of Binance, which operates the largest digital asset exchange by volume.    Today’s most promising DeFi apps all share a similar vision for the future: The creation of a divergent financial system where capital and data flows more equitably, shifting control away from institutions and towards the individual. However, there isn’t a straight path from point A to point B. The most popular DeFi apps are still dwarfed by most centralized exchanges, which wield outsized impact and influence within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. The best centralized exchanges offer a compelling mix of user-friendly services that are more easily understood by end-users.      For instance, our cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, offers a comprehensive suite of financial products that mirrors those found in traditional markets. Users can buy, sell and trade crypto, choose options and futures trading, apply for crypto loans, earn passive income and more with a single login. These centralized products are easy to use and comprehend, and can be accessed using a web browser, desktop or mobile app. At earlier stages of development, it’s also easier to increase the pace of innovation with centralized technology, as teams can work in concert to build new features, fix bugs and produce the kinds of fine iterations that improve the overall user experience. By focusing on delivering a superior user experience in tandem with top-notch security, centralized exchanges essentially live or die based on their ability to “create trust” among their users.      Trust also happens to be the major battle DeFi must win to reach mainstream success. Users primarily care about three things when it comes to financial products: liquidity, security and stability. These are the characteristics that enable trust (and reliable earnings) to take place. Whereas today’s DeFi protocols can be notoriously difficult to understand and access, over the years, centralized finance (CeFi) platforms have gradually become more accessible and multi-dimensional, with sophisticated order-matching engines, asset custody and stable technology.    We believe the future of the industry lies in decentralization, and with the momentum increasing, it’s time to go all-in.    These characteristics are telling because they reflect the crypto exchange’s raison d’être: to promote market and industry construction. CeFi’s concerns start and end with the building of mature infrastructure for the future of the crypto market. Once the foundation is in place, the platform itself takes a back seat to the diverse and innovative applications being built on the platform. Rather than driving the market as innovators, centralized exchanges will gradually settle into a role as an infrastructure provider for trailblazing projects. Ultimately, centralized exchanges are a transient product that will provide users with a bridge to the world of DeFi.      Here’s what we think will happen next: CeFi players will continue to lower the barriers to entry for DeFi and DeFi-like projects, allowing their users to sample the benefits of DeFi, while retaining the liquidity, security and stability the users are accustomed to with CeFi offerings. Once these proof-of-concept projects are “verified” by the market and the DeFi model proves to be successful, then market demand will follow.      See also: Binance’s CZ Views ‘CeDeFi’ as a Complement, Not a Competitor, to DeFi      Today, Binance users can access DeFi-inspired products like staking, lending and pooling services. In addition, we are committing a $100 million accelerator fund for DeFi projects on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a smart contracts-enabled blockchain that allows developers to build decentralized apps and digital assets. Among the wave of inaugural DeFi projects that debut on BSC, there’s a chance one of them will become the next “killer” application.      It seems we’ve already reached “the turning point” when it comes to DeFi adoption. After all, the enduring appeal of financial self-custody and decentralization are central to the original promise of blockchain technology. It has the capability of increasing the freedom of money for all who participate, bringing financial opportunities to more people than ever before. As such, DeFi provides the terminal trajectory for the future of crypto.      However, it will need help from CeFi platforms, which will be, for many users, the gateway through which they access DeFi for the first time. We believe the future of the industry lies in decentralization, and with the momentum increasing, it’s time to go all-in.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Changpeng Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/29/all-in-on-defi-why-the-days-of-centralized-exchanges-are-numbered,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dcd55a5e30f84a48624ec680b345fad02065c158-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433016,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2dTh,1603980036,Huobi Beefs Up Venture Arm With Former DragonFly Partner Leading DeFi Investments,"Alex Pack, a former managing partner at crypto investment firm Dragonfly Capital, has joined Huobi Group as a corporate investment advisor to help the firm behind the world’s top centralized exchange by derivatives trading volumes to invest in decentralized finance, of DeFi.      “When I left DragonFly earlier this year, Huobi was also ramping up its internationalization efforts and its corporate investment practice,” Pack told CoinDesk in an interview. “I thought Huobi has the potential to be one of the most impactful companies in crypto. When I was approached by my old friends there to help them, I thought it was a no-brainer.”      Pack’s new role at Huobi will largely focus on expanding Huobi’s stakes in DeFi projects in Western countries, after Huobi’s newly launched venture investment arm began pouring money into DeFi projects in Asia. He told CoinDesk he and Huobi are willing to spend up to “tens of millions of dollars'' funds to support new DeFi projects.      In his previous role at DragonFly, Pack was an early-stage investor of many significant crypto projects including DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Compound Finance. He left the crypto investment firm in April, citing “a difference in vision on the direction of the firm,” though he stayed on as a part-time venture partner.      Huobi, along with other centralized crypto exchange giants, is rushing to reposition itself as an integral part of the exploding DeFi sector. Those semi-decentralized, blockchain-based lending and trading platforms have accumulated more than $10 billion in total value locked, most of which has occurred since the start of the second half of 2020.      Unlike Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volumes, which has built a public decentralized blockchain to help support DeFi projects, the company behind the Huobi exchange has been focused more on incubating DeFi projects by funding, research and leveraging its established user base.      “Today there are two things: ‘CeFi’ [centralized finance] and ‘DeFi,’ in crypto parlance,” Pack said. “In the next 10 years, I think they will merge … and you will see companies that have wallets – Huobi already has a large wallet – do decentralized exchanges and decentralized versions of everything they offer. And you will see decentralized finance grow and mirror many of the aspects of centralized finance exchanges as well.”      “Huobi is one of the largest entities so it is in a perfect position to help this merging happen,” he added.      While current DeFi projects are still mostly centered around lending protocols and stablecoins, Pack said the particular type of DeFi projects he will initially look at are those that build synthetic assets on blockchains.      “The most interesting thing next that we are going to see are things in particular like synthetic assets, the ability to make a derivative or a synthetic version of anything: a stock, a bond, an entire fixed income space,” Pack said, “and then more products that support security, like insurance products, that makes it more trustworthy to enter into DeFi.”      Pack went quiet after he left Dragonfly Capital earlier this year. According to Pack, Huobi’s strong presence in Asia is also part of the reason why he decided to join.      “The most users and the most business model information and infrastructures are in Asia,” he said. “And yet, by far, the most interesting technology and the new frontier things are happening in the West. And I've always tried to be a bridge between those two areas.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/29/huobi-beefs-up-venture-arm-with-former-dragonfly-partner-leading-defi-investments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2ed2cc281dab049a020a894768e3e3e96f062fa-1942x1086.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Citing an article from The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Iran Daily reported earlier this week the country's cabinet has amended recent legislation on digital assets to allow cryptocurrency to be used for import funding by the Central Bank of Iran (CBI).  The amendment had been jointly proposed by the CBI and the cabinet previously.  The change means legally mined cryptocurrency in Iran can only be exchanged if used to fund imports from other nations.  Miners will supply the cryptocurrency directly to the CBI within an authorized limit, per IRNA's report.  This would be based on how much subsidized energy a miner uses, as well as instructions to be published by the Ministry of Energy.  Cryptocurrency has become increasingly important in Iran as the nation suffers from economic woes brought by U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic.  Mining was legalized last year, however the industry is heavily regulated by the government making it a tough jurisdiction in which to operate.

In a letter sent to all regulated entities on Thursday, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) said that it expects firms, including virtual currency businesses, to start assessing such risks and develop possible approaches to mitigate them. The letter follows similar guidelines issued by the NYDFS for the state’s insurance providers in September.      Noting that each rise of one degree celsius in global temperatures leads to damages worth 1.2% of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), the letter said reduced economic output in communities hit harder by climate change could also lead to an increase in default rates, reduced lending activity, devalued assets and losses. It added that flood risk could impact regional and community banks in particular.      Addressing virtual currency businesses, the letter stated that studies suggest the environmental impact of mining cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can be substantial. “The energy cost for mining virtual currencies is sizable compared to the value of the virtual currencies,” said the letter.      While the letter acknowledged the exact energy consumption of bitcoin mining also depends on the geography, it added that “virtual currency firms should consider increasing transparency of the location and equipment used in bitcoin mining,” in order to add clarity about the environmental impact.      A similar concern regarding the environmental impact of crypto mining was also raised by Heath Tarbert, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), during an interview at CoinDesk’s invest:ethereum economy event. “There are issues with mining, of course, so number one [is] environmental issues,” he said, speaking about Ethereum’s move to a proof-of-stake system and how that could help make Ethereum more environmentally friendly.      Read More: The Last Word on Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption      While there are pressing concerns about bitcoin’s energy consumption, it is also important to note that the environmental impact also depends on how that energy was produced. For example, China’s Sichuan region is a bitcoin mining hub but is also plush with supply of hydroelectric power.      According to the letter, the NYDFS expects all regulated virtual currency businesses to conduct an assessment of climate change associated risks which could impact them directly or indirectly.      The letter said organizations like banks, mortgage servicers, etc. should also designate a board member, a committee of the board, as well as a senior management function, responsible for the assessment and management of financial risks from climate change.      Adding that the NYDFS understands climate change is likely to affect organizations differently, the regulator’s letter said each organization should take a “proportionate approach” that reflects its exposure to climate change associated financial risks.      “DFS is developing a strategy for integrating climate-related risks into its supervisory mandate,” the letter said, indicating that mitigating climate change-associated risks is likely to stay on the regulator’s radar.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | COMMODITY | ETH | MINING,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/29/new-yorks-financial-regulator-wants-firms-including-crypto-miners-to-look-closer-at-climate-change-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c3458f9a0246d1cb3171bf823be5eb284a7faff-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""This new round of capital will enable Figment to continue to invest in our best-in-class blockchain staking, governance, and developer tools,"" Figment's CEO Lorien Gabel said in a statement.  The funding follows a pre-seed round of $1 million in 2018 and a seed round in 2019 bringing in $1.5 million, also with participation from Bonfire, XDL, Lemniscap, and FJ Labs.  Gabel said the company believes in an internet where people control and profit from their own data, rather than ""large data monopolies and governments"" – an objective Figment is working to achieve.  The company provides infrastructure and tools for networks such as Cosmos, Polkadot, Celo, and Skale, as well as offering what it calls ""institutional-grade"" staking services on over 30 blockchains.

42432991,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2aRh,1603976164,"First Mover: Bitcoin Falls as COVID-19 Surges, ECB's Lagarde Steps Up, US GDP Hits 33%","Bitcoin was lower for a second day, even as traditional markets showed signs of stabilization following Wednesday's sell-off.      Cryptocurrency analysts looked for solace in bitcoin's October-to-date return, still at an impressive 22%, during a month when the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks has declined by 2.7%.      ""The sell-off in equities and gold due to rising COVID infections and restrictive lockdowns had only a limited impact on the digital asset,"" Lennard Neo, head of research for the cryptocurrency-focused firm Stack Funds, wrote Thursday in a report.      In traditional markets, European stocks rose as traders awaited a decision from the European Central Bank, headed by President Christine Lagarde, on whether further monetary support is needed amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases.      U.S. equity futures pointed toward a higher open, as a key government report showed that the world's largest economy grew at a 33% pace in the third quarter – a somewhat context-less data point that's likely to do little beyond serving as an easy talking point for President Donald Trump's reelection campaign.    Market moves    Just as bitcoin bulls were starting to salivate over the cryptocurrency's powerful rally over the past week toward $14,000, a sell-off in traditional markets has dragged prices back down.      Investors globally were rattled by reports of a resurgence in coronavirus cases. German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the country would implement tough new business restrictions, and French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to impose a national lockdown.      Such restrictions could crimp economic growth, theoretically a deflationary development, which could reduce demand for bitcoin in the short term as a hedge against higher consumer prices. There's also the possibility that some investors, seeing further turmoil ahead, decided to bulk up on cash. One of the easiest things to sell is bitcoin, which is still up 84% year-to-date, even after Wednesday's sell-off.      ""It seems the pressure was too much,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, told clients Wednesday.      As detailed in First Mover on Wednesday, analysts relying on price-chart patterns have identified few points of resistance along bitcoin's path from the hitherto rarely breached $14,000 psychological level to the all-time-high around $20,000, reached in 2017.      According to Greenspan, ""$14,000 is a huge psychological barrier, and I would be delightedly flabbergasted if we were able to pass through it without first seeing a significant pullback.""      And as reported Thursday by CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole, bitcoin options traders are assigning a low probability that the cryptocurrency will end 2020 above $20,000.      The implied chances of prices above that level currently stand around 6%, according to the cryptocurrency data firm Skew.      “A below-10% probability of record highs by the year end means the market is unconcerned with that outcome,” Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain Capital-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5 told Godbole in a Telegram chat.      Despite the sincerest wishes of bitcoin bulls, it would take a rally of more than 60% in the next eight weeks for prices to set a new record. It wouldn't be unprecedented: There have been eight times in the 11-year old cryptocurrency's recorded history where prices have rallied more than 50% or more in a two-month span.      It could be that traders are just being realistic.      “The options market is seemingly not getting carried away with the recent strong price momentum,” Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, said in a statement to CoinDesk. “If we extrapolate bitcoin’s price action and volatility of the past 90 days till December expiry, then bitcoin appears set to end the year between $14,000 to $15,000.”      Read More: Bitcoin’s Options Market Sees Just 6% Chance of $20K Before Year’s End    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin's price rally has paused, with the top cryptocurrency by market value near $13,100, having reached 16-month highs above $13,800 during Wednesday's Asian trading hours.      Investors are rotating money out of stocks and into safe havens like the U.S. dollar and Treasurys on concerns that Germany and France's new lockdown restrictions would torpedo Eurozone's fragile economic recovery.      Not just bitcoin, but almost every asset denominated in U.S. dollars has taken a beating in the past 24 hours or so. Markets saw similar but more violent action in March when recession fears triggered a global dash for cash.      Should the virus figures continue to rise, risk aversion will likely intensify, fueling a more profound decline in the cryptocurrency. However, it's possible investors could buy the dips, with rising institutional adoption boosting the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects.      Besides, stock markets will likely stabilize, helping bitcoin regain poise if the ECB announces more monetary stimulus later Thursday. While the central bank is expected to maintain the status quo, it could lay the groundwork for additional stimulus in December. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs said the central bank could boost its pandemic bond-buying program by 400 billion euros ($470 billion) in December to counter deflationary pressures.      From a technical analysis standpoint, the immediate bias will remain bullish as long as prices are held above $12,500. On the higher side, the June 2019 high of $13,880 is the level to beat for the bulls.      – Omkar Godbole    Token watch    Bitcoin (BTC): Winklevosses' Gemini cryptocurrency exchange allows purchasing and trading with euros.

In an announcement Thursday, the Canada-based firm said revenue rose to roughly $1.1 million, marking a 1,159% rise from the previous fiscal year's tally of $87,318.      Other figures for the same period are also impressive: customer assets jumped by 1,959% to $35 million, while the total of brokerage accounts were up 750% at 86,000.      In its bid to boost growth, the firm formed new partnerships with leading trading platforms including Market Rebellion, LLC, Sterling Trading Tech and RoundlyX, and acquired Ethos Universal Wallet and Circle Invest's trading app.      ""We achieved strong revenue and account growth during fiscal 2020,"" Stephen Ehrlich, co-founder, and CEO of Voyager said, adding that increasing adoption of digital assets has helped the company extend the growth momentum into the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.

In an interview with Reuters published Thursday, Bank of Canada (BoC) Governor Tiff Macklem said his institution is working with G7 member states on its plans for a central bank digital currency (CBDC).      The digital dollar project, he said, is now moving beyond the proof-of-concept stage and closer to being ready for launch. However, the governor deflated expectations, saying he thought there isn't a need for one ""right now.""      Even so, Macklem shared concerns about being outpaced by other countries, adding his institution wants to make sure it's prepared for a CBDC launch if it chooses to head in that direction.      “If another country has [a CBDC] and we don’t, that could certainly create some problems,” Macklem said. ""We certainly wouldn’t want to be surprised by some other country.""      G7 members should share information on their CBDC plans and timelines, he added.      The G7 includes some of the world's largest developed nations – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K and the U.S. – as member states, which generally act in unison to address global economic issues.

The Bahamas became the first nation to take a CBDC into circulation this month, rolling out its ""sand dollar"" to increase financial access to underserved communities.

42432989,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2aNh,1603965600,Bitcoin’s Options Market Sees Just 6% Chance of $20K Before Year's End,"While bitcoin's rally over the past month has revived talks of its price reaching new record highs above $20,000 by the end of the year, the cryptocurrency's options market continues to assign a very low probability of that scenario playing out.      At press time, bitcoin was seeing a 6% probability of bitcoin trading above the historical 2017 all-time high of $20,000 by the end of December, according to data source Skew.      ""A below-10% probability of record highs by the year end means the market is unconcerned with that outcome,"" Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain Capital-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5 told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      An option is a derivative that gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specific price on or before a particular date. A call option gives its owner the right to buy something while a put option gives the right to sell.      Option probabilities are calculated using the Black-Scholes formula based on critical metrics such as call options' prices, strike prices, the price of the underlying asset and the ""risk-free"" interest rate on investments as U.S. Treasurys and the time to maturation.    Market underpricing record high probability?    Bitcoin's price has rallied from $3,867 to $13,800 over the past 7½ months. However, while prices have risen by over 250%, the chances of bitcoin reaching record highs by the end of the year have seen what appears to be a marginal rise from 4% to 6%. The probability peaked at 8% in July.      As such, one may conclude the options market is underpricing the possibility of prices rising to $20,000 before Dec. 31.      However, that's not necessarily the case because bitcoin now has just eight weeks to chart a 50% rally to $20,000. Back in March, bitcoin had three quarters – nine months – to challenge record highs. As the time to expiration decreases, the probability of prices rising beyond a particular level declines.      Read more: Bitcoin Options Volume on CME Jumps 300% as Traders Take Bullish Bets      Besides, bitcoin has appreciated by 50% or more in two months only eight times in its 10-year history, and three out of the eight bi-monthly 50% price rallies have happened during the bull market frenzy of 2017.      Considering the decline in the time left for December expiry and bitcoin's historical price action, the options market may appear rational in pricing a 6% probability of the cryptocurrency reaching lifetime highs by the end of December.      “The options market is seemingly not getting carried away with the recent strong price momentum,"" Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, said in a statement to CoinDesk. Chung added that, ""if we extrapolate bitcoin's price action and volatility of the past 90 days till December expiry, then bitcoin appears set to end the year between $14,000 to $15,000.""      The options market currently sees a 40% probability of prices trading above $14,000 by the end of the year.      Some traders may argue the options market is overpricing the odds of bitcoin rising above $20,000. That's because the three-month implied volatility (IV), or investors' expectations of how volatile prices could be over the next quarter, is hovering well above the three-month realized volatility (RV), or price deviations, seen over the past quarter.      Currently, three-month IV is seen at 3.2%, and the RV is hovering at 2.5%. Option market probabilities have a positive correlation with implied volatility.      Looking ahead, the odds of prices setting a new record high this year would rise if the cryptocurrency charts a quick move above the June 2019 high of $13,880. According to technical charts, there is very little resistance between $13,880 and $20,000.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/29/bitcoins-options-market-sees-just-6-chance-of-20k-before-years-end,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4195947afa6d5ab7189f50b84a499f31daa2a02e-1920x1163.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The additions mean users can begin trading high demand stocks like Tesla, Apple, and Amazon, represented by tokens, against bitcoin, stablecoins and more.      “These products demonstrate a powerful future, in which assets are digitized and traders have unlimited creative potential to express their beliefs about the markets,” FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said.      To facilitate liquidity, the tokens represent a fraction of one share, meaning traders will be able to trade half of a share at a time if they want, Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk via Telegram.      The offering is being conducted in partnership with capital markets solutions provider Digital Assets AG and investment firm CM Equity.      “These fractional stock products reflect the reality that today’s traders are industry and sector spanning and want trading opportunities that fully match their interests and mindset,” the CEO said.

The value of the investment has not been announced yet, CoinDesk Japan reported.  MoneyTap, a blockchain money-transfer app launched through a joint venture between SBI and Ripple called SBI Ripple Asia, went live in 2018. Like Venmo, the app allows users to send and receive money with their telephone numbers or QR codes.  MoneyTap uses Ripple’s global financial settlements network RippleNet to provide the payment services, which include peer-to-peer transfers, overseas remittances and corporate payments.  Delays, high costs, uncertainties and opacity in processing international remittances are prompting hundreds of financial institutions to adopt blockchain solutions like Ripple Net, which directly connects the remittance bank and receiving bank while sharing information through a distributed ledger.  ""The high interbank fees in Japan have not been corrected for more than 40 years, and it is a special situation internationally,"" SBI said in a statement, adding the blockchain app could help reduce transfer fees in remittance payments.  In addition to SBI Holdings, MoneyTap is supported by a number of Japanese financial institutions including Sumitomo SBI Net Bank, Daiwa Securities Group Headquarters, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Ashikaga Bank, Ogaki Kyoritsu Bank and Seven Bank.
