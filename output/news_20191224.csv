Over the same period, the average crypto donation has hovered around $10,000, according to BitPay statistics. BitPay processes donations at a 1 percent flat-rate fee, which can be picked up by donors as well if they wish.      Working similarly to stock donations, crypto donations are acknowledged for tax purposes, as heralded during this year’s rendition of Giving Tuesday.      “In accepting bitcoin donations, charitable organizations attract new donors without ever having to hold bitcoin,” BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said. “BitPay verifies the funds and accepts the bitcoin on behalf of the organization and settles the transaction in USD or the preferred fiat.”      The ACS relies mostly on grassroots fundraising, particularly among people in their forties and fifties, Woodward told CoinDesk. As crypto is a nascent financial technology, the ACS hopes working with BitPay will bring younger donors into the fold.      “The reality is that more and more people are utilizing cryptocurrency,” said Woodward. “This allows us to be relevant with younger donors and provide frictionless giving opportunities for them and for us to meet them where they are.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/24/american-cancer-society-now-accepting-bitcoin-donations-through-bitpay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d6bc7750ab1773486809453b35ff45186b24332-1200x772.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383085,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9u8Kr,1577213104,Paraguay Audits Local Crypto Industry to Prepare for FATF-Style Regulations,"Paraguay is preparing to take its nascent cryptocurrency industry mainstream.      Last week, the Latin American country’s anti-money-laundering (AML) chief, the Secretary for Preventing Money and Property Laundering (SEPRELAD), announced a nationwide crypto survey. All of Paraguay’s virtual asset service providers (VASPs) were directed to open their books to the government for the first time. The self-reported information was due Dec. 20.      Impelled by the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) June guidance on VASPs, the mass audit will help Paraguay’s government understand its domestic crypto industry, SEPRELAD officials told CoinDesk. Also, it will pave the way for the country’s first crypto-specific regulations, set to roll out in the first half of 2020.      “Data obtained will be used to measure the degree of adoption, complexity and size of the virtual asset market in Paraguay, with the purpose of drafting a regulation that adequately regulates them and mitigates the risk of misuse,” Secretary Minister Christian Villanueva said.      Never before has this landlocked nation of 6.8 million regulated cryptocurrencies, although its central bank warned the public last June that only the guaraní currency is considered to be legal tender.      Paraguay has instead largely avoided the issue. In a country dominated by off-the-books business dealings – the International Monetary Fund estimated that informal employment represents “more than half” of Paraguay’s total jobs – bitcoin regulation was a financial afterthought.      But FATF’s June 2019 regulatory guidelines increased pressure for Paraguay to develop crypto standards, according to Villanueva. Recommendation 15 of the FATF guideline expanded AML benchmarks to include technologies such as “virtual assets”      Now, with its new directive, SEPRELAD puts Paraguay on track for compliance with Recommendation 15 before 2020 is out. Crypto miners, over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks, exchanges and other VASPs will have to register with the government and implement baseline oversight on their customers’ doings, with counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) protocols and AML safeguards, SEPRELAD said.    Financial inclusion    SEPRELAD’s audit puts VASPs on track for eventual inclusion in Paraguay’s formal financial landscape, according to business analyst and Paraguayan bitcoiner Stan Canova.      Before the government took a stand on crypto, Canova said, Paraguay’s banking sector shut out the miners and traders that did. The government had the “perfect excuse” to deny business-facing bitcoiners baseline financial tools, such as bank accounts.      “The banks said [to VASPs], ‘Hey, you're not being controlled by SEPRELAD. You’re not under the umbrella of the law. So you're a risk,’” Canova said.      VASPs, therefore, store piles of cash in private vaults, according to Jorge Ramírez, founder and CEO of the OTC service Cripex.      Ramírez and Canova both claim industry members already engage in self-governance, even though they are not required to do so under the law.      “We here in Paraguay, we auto-regulate ourselves. And we institute the same level of compliance that the banks have with their customers in regards to KYC and AML, even though the banks don’t want to work with us,” Ramírez said.      Acceptance and resistance    Paraguay’s AML enforcer recently brokered a regulatory détente with the country’s crypto businesses.      In September, Congressman Sebastían Garciá, an active voice in Paraguay’s crypto space, held a conference attended by SEPRELAD and the industry, seeking to find common ground.      SEPRELAD then determined the sector is “predisposed” to working with it on FATF compliance, Secretary Villanueva said.      But not everyone in the community welcomes government oversight, according to Canova, who lobbied on miners’ and traders’ behalf at the September meeting.      “There was another group in the hearing and they were totally angry about SEPRELAD oversight,” Canova said. “Some people don't want anything to do with anti-money-laundering or due diligence with their clients.”      Canova predicted that certain businesses and groups will hold out, even if it’s to their detriment.      “This thing is going to be polarizing,” Canova said.

42383095,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9u8WB,1577205932,Bomb Threats Demanding Bitcoin Force Evacuations Across Russia,"Someone has been sending bomb threats across Russia, demanding $870,000 worth of bitcoin supposedly stolen from the defunct cryptocurrency exchange WEX.      For almost a month, anonymous blackmailers have been threatening to blow up courts, schools, shopping malls, transportation hubs and a television station unless someone sends “120 bitcoin stolen from the WEX exchange” to their address.      No one was hurt, nor were any bombs detonated, but 750,000 people have had to evacuate buildings since the threats started on Nov. 28, Russian news agency Interfax reported. Court buildings in Moscow and Saint Petersburg were the first to receive threats.      So far only a negligible amount of bitcoin, about $0.48 worth, has been sent to the address, in a single transaction on Dec. 9.      The anonymous actors are blaming Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeev and a former officer of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), Anton Nemkin, for the alleged theft of bitcoin, citing a report by the BBC published in November. The story cited the testimony of the alleged administrator of WEX, Alexei Bilyuchenko.      According to Bilyuchenko, two FSB officers forced him to hand over all the bitcoin from the wallets of the crypto exchange, the successor of another failed exchange, BTC-e. He also claimed that Malofeev and Nemkin were demanding that he hand over the database of WEX users to them.      WEX froze withdrawals and gradually ceased operations last year, soon after it was sold by its previous CEO Dmitri Vasilev to Dmitri Khavchenko, a militia fighter in the civil war in Ukraine, known to be close to Malofeev.

42383073,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9u89X,1577205000,Amir Taaki's Ongoing Crypto Revolution,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Amir Taaki created libbitcoin, the first alternative bitcoin implementation, and has worked on the wallets Electrum and Darkwallet as well as privacy markets and decentralized technologies. He founded the Autonomous Polytechnics.      Amir Taaki thinks crypto has lost its way. But this isn’t exactly new.      One of the first programmers to work on the bitcoin source code, Taaki split from the group of core developers to build the first independent implementation of bitcoin. Libbitcoin was intended as a springboard for a new community of cryptographers organized around a set of ideals.      He moved to Calafou, an autonomous post-capitalist colony in Catalonia, Spain, and started a hacklab. It’s here Taaki incubated a number of projects, including Bitcoin Magazine, and upstart coders, like ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin.      Taaki has been saying for years technology can only succeed if guided by ideology. This was the principle behind Darkwallet, an attempt to anonymize bitcoin. Likewise, political revolutions need a technical arm. In 2015, Taaki travelled to Syria as a freedom-fighter with the Rojavan militia, where he spent time on the battlefield and working on civilian projects.      The crypto scene Taaki returned to a year later was flooded with cash. Though the real affront was 2017’s bull run, which saw billions of dollars come into the industry. Watching this misallocation of capital has informed Taaki’s thinking today.      “People say we’re going to change the world, get a million dollars and have fun while we’re doing it,” Taaki said. “No. Making money, changing the world and having fun are separate things. You must make a decision about your priorities.”      Alternatively defined as an anarchist or democratic confederalist, Taaki has put politics at the center of his life. In a sense, this word is too large and too small to define his vision. His political aims include the dismantling of nation-states as well as organizing local, self-sovereign communities.      For CoinDesk's Year in Review series, we called Taaki in his Barcelona-based bunker, where he’s establishing the Autonomous Polytechnics academy. The project is envisioned as a training center for revolutionary technologists, where ascetic hackers will learn philosophy alongside python. Announced in 2018, Taaki is still looking for more funding.      How has the Autonomous Polytechnics project progressed?      Slowly, but it’s been going. We’re now nearly finished. I need another $40,000. I’m trying to find the right people to put [it] down. We have a whole bunch of projects and events next year to prepare for.      Do you currently have pupils?      Just a few people around in general. But we don't have the capacity to start on-boarding people onto projects or have interns. I have a few projects that we’re doing and I need to get them to the prototype stage. But my capacity is limited right now, and I have a lot of pressure because I’m invested in a lot of things.      Your fundraising has been going on for a while.      It’s difficult to make people invest. The problem with crypto is there is no wider level of organization. There are a lot of provincial companies that are short-term focused, so it’s been difficult to get people to invest in things that have a macro advantage. That’s why I have to start businesses to bring in income to fund things that matter.      Having come back from Asia, and seeing the huge amount of capital flowing around, made me realize how insane resources allocation is here. It’s massively inefficient. There are projects with too much money that don’t produce anything of value. And there are people with talent without business acumen, who are getting fucked by the ecosystem.      This touches on something I wanted to ask. You originally wanted to set up Autonomous Polytechnics in Greece, but you had issues with the culture. How can decentralized projects thrive when there are such great differences between communities and countries?      Well, the main reason I moved from Greece was because I needed to be in Western Europe to be able to do projects and interact with people. Greece is too out of the way, you might as well be in the Middle East. Long term, we want to open up places in Latin America and Asia. And after a while, Russia and the Middle East.      Why would you start with Latin America and Asia?      There is a huge amount of opportunity in Asia, so it’s important to be embedded in that market. And Latin America, simply because it’s a political gold mine. We have to be prepared in order to take advantage of that. There’s also a lot of talent there. There needs to be a systematic organization. It’s no good doing things ad hoc.      What do you make of the recent events in Bolivia.      It was a coup. When news like this happens, I think there is interest by people who say crypto is growing. But a lot of times, I think they are trying to manifest it through news. There are journalists whose shtick is to write about these things and are constantly searching for them, so it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.      But I think these events were a big missed opportunity, that no one was prepared with analysis beforehand or an organized group to take advantage of the events.      Let’s say you were on the ground in Bolivia when the coup happened, how would you achieve your political aims?      I think before we get on the ground we need to think about the steps we need to take. An interesting segue into this is to talk about crypto.      I don’t buy the institutional money narrative: that big money will come into crypto and that’s when it’ll take off. Crypto already exists. There is a huge market where huge amounts of money are being moved around. It’s relatively small compared to traditional finance, but it exists. Most of that is gray or black money and is diametrically opposed to traditional financial markets.    Traditional finance is a giant cartel, where people own different niches of the market, and they all collude.    Traditional finance is a giant cartel, where people own different niches of the market, and they all collude. These people use offshore havens to hide their wealth. States are putting pressure on the practice and audits are happening, but people are finding smarter ways to hide their money. They’re setting up financial infrastructure, and moving from the realm of finance into politics.      We [in crypto] have to think, not in terms of markets or money, but holistically, in terms of power. What is the nature of power? It has a physical coercive aspect. A financial aspect. An organizational aspect. A technological aspect. Even a philosophical or socio-cultural aspect.      Right now, the political consciousness within blockchain is so low, it’s unable to respond to the challenges or opportunities it faces. Yeah, ok, there are a few crypto rich with yachts and lambos. But it’s limited in its vision. The old money, the old wealth, have the entire systems to protect their wealth. We have to think at that level, how to maintain and secure power.      Before our call you sent a report by MEMRI about how terrorists are using cryptocurrencies. Should we be worried?      Terrorist groups are making use of bitcoin, ethereum, monero and zcash to raise donations. Any militant group across the world can send money to their hubs. No state can stop that. That's the reality. It's a kind of fantasy we’re living in that the crypto market will bring peace. We’re in a period of transition in global humanity that will be incredibly violent. America is losing its hegemonic status. Russia and China are working together in the arctic to lay claim. In between will be proxy wars and new frontiers. Those will be opportunities if we’re prepared. We already have the financial and technological power to leverage.      What does this mean for privacy coins?      The delisting of monero off exchanges and the deanonymization of mimblewimble are another big story this year. I've argued for a long time that monero and mimblewimble are not anonymous. On Twitter there’s a whole thread with Fluffypony. These are the first generation of crypto coins. At some point there will be a crypto that is purely anonymous, fast and scalable (where you can run a whole node on a mobile). That’s the holy grail of crypto and we’re getting closer every day.      Bitcoin is a legacy system. There is no good alternative at this point, but it will be replaced.      You also wanted to talk about Libra.      People don’t realize how much of a threat Libra actually was. I’ve read their technical specs, and it’s a well-designed system. We almost lost the narrative. We’re actually very lucky the U.S. Congress responded with a resounding no. We have to start organizing, our communities are too passive and think they don’t have to do anything because crypto is an inevitability. Technologically speaking, we need to develop.      It’s like Linux, the promise of an ""operating system made by people for the people."" There was a time when free software was a principle, and everyone knew that Microsoft was shitty. What happened was MacOS came out of left field and took over the market. We missed the opportunity. This happens across history, where idealists have an idea, are unable to organize effectively and some organized group comes along and takes the initiative from them.      If you look inside the ethereum community, it’s entirely captured. It’s because the Ethereum Foundation has no foresight. The project will probably fail. It’s certainly not going to live up to expectations.      Have you heard of the tyranny of structurelessness?      They say it’s decentralized and nobody is in charge, but really there are people in charge. If you don’t create a system for people to acknowledge or challenge power, or a system to onboard people to create new leaders of the future, then what happens is people invade your open community and seize the narrative. They use their greater resources to attract talent into their silos. That’s basically happened to ethereum. They don't know how to respond except by becoming more authoritarian.      Your relationship with Vitalik has been widely reported. Have you voiced your concerns to him?      To be honest, Vitalik has low social intelligence, so he surrounds himself with sycophants. He hasn’t stepped up to his leadership role.      That’s the consequence of a poorly thought-out system of organization. The first generation of blockchain organizations will die off in an extinction event. There was a period that opened and a group quickly grabbed the mic and threw code together. But they’re bumping up against their own limitations because they didn’t invest any time or energy or resource into developing their thought or vision.      Any technology requires huge amounts of organization between many people to create complex system. It’s not just individuals in a marketplace throwing together random code. It requires planning and strategy. There's a window opening. Do we want to be minor players? Do we want to be a joke? Or do we want to be a global power?      Right now, the community is a bunch of kids.      Why do you suspect that is?      It’s like an army. You have foot soldiers, a commander working on the tactical and operational level and a layer above that, a general, thinking in macroscale movements. When developing a company the CEO is a visionary, he doesn’t need to micromanage because it doesn’t scale. That way of thinking is not being nurtured in the crypto industry. Especially not in bitcoin or ethereum. That’s why they’re failing to efficiently allocate resources. It’s easy to work on many things, but if you’re not able to discriminate what’s higher priority you’ll get sucked into lower hanging fruit.      Like at crypto conferences: It’s unprofessional. You have to hang around for hours and go to parties to talk to one guy. They should just be having meetings where we can directly discuss things we need to do. But there’s this bleeding between public and private life. People say we’re going to change the world, and get a million dollars, and have fun while we’re doing it.    Making money, changing the world, and having fun are separate things. Make a decision about your priorities.    No. Making money, changing the world, and having fun are separate things. Make a decision about your priorities. It’s a fantasy.      Are there any people in the industry you’re inspired by?      I don’t know if they want to be named. Outside of crypto, to be honest, politically, all the interesting things are happening in the right wing. Steve Bannon [former head of Breitbart News] is really interesting. How he got Trump elected, and then went to Europe to meet with [Nigel] Farage about Brexit. I think Brexit is a good thing. It could lead to the breakup of the United Kingdom. Scotland is saying it wants a referendum. I think that’s a great result: the balkanization of power.      We’re on a precipice, and Bannon knows where to push strategically and tactically to create a change. The biggest problem in Europe is not about redistribution of wealth, or more welfare or benefits. People are sick of benefits and welfare. People want dignity. People want to be a part of a community. And doing meaningful work and providing for people. There is a deficit of democracy and local power. People don’t have sovereignty or destiny over their lives. That’s not being addressed by the left. The rightwing is coming in with a moralistic message.      I think there’s a risk of you being misunderstood here. Can you create a system of strong nations or support balkanization while preventing a resurgence of fascism?      On the one hand, there’s nationalism. Then there’s patriotism, or the right to be culturally different. In my opinion, there’s nothing wrong with culture or community or the concept of a nation that’s bonded by a culture, language or a way of life. That’s what creates social bonds. Someone that doesn’t have a patriotism feels a kind of estrangement from society. Nationalism is different, chauvinist, like a football team organized around a flag. It’s about domination and exclusion. Nationalism is a caricature of the nation.      There may be another contradiction we should address. You’re supportive of dark markets that remain outside state control, but are fearful of terrorists financing themselves with crypto. How can you have one without the other?      I’m not fearful, I’m saying this is a reality the world has to face. Making an omelette you crack a few eggs. I think the state is one of the most harmful things to human dignity. The western idea of the nation-state has outlived its moment. It’s the construct that’s enforcing order on the world right now. And when it is eroded, you’re taking the lid off a pressure cooker. There are things that will emerge that are unimaginable for us to deal with right now. The longer it's out of sight, the worse it gets. You can kick the football 20 years down the line, but something will happen. Some of this will be forced by upstart geopolitical powers like Russia, Hindu nationalists in India, Islamic terrorists, neo-fascists in Ukraine, unrest in Chile, financial disorder in Venezuela, coups in Bolivia. We’re living in unstable times.      That’s why I'm talking about crypto-communities.      What are you working on?      I’m really interested in anonymous crypto-systems and systems for anonymizing cryptocurrencies. I have a cryptographic scheme for an anonymous cryptocurrency. The thing is, we don’t have the money to hire cryptographers to revue the math, that’s why I’m starting a smaller project on how to anonymize currencies before developing one. Longer term, we’re looking to anonymize cryptosystems in general and creating a platform for apps to apply the tech towards that.      Right now, my main focus is the academies. It’s a two-part system. The first is polytechnics to train people in philosophy and technology to solve problems and do research. The second is the business component, focused on dark tech. We’re creating an incubator and trying to find people to onboard and fund the training.      There are so many young people in crypto who understand blockchain’s role in the future, but don’t have space where they can explore ideas or develop. They end up doing slave work for companies. A lot of crypto projects have a start-up mentality to get loads of money to pay for the best developers, which is inverted.

42383096,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9u8XR,1577203207,Hedera Hashgraph Asks Investors to Wait Longer for Tokens After Price Crash,"Hedera Hashgraph, the company behind the blockchain-like Hedera network, is asking investors to wait longer for tokens they paid for, in order to stabilize their cratering price.      In return for a delayed distribution of their HBAR tokens, investors would ultimately get more of them than originally stipulated in a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT). Over time, this additional allocation would help them recoup their initial investments.      ""[P]articipating SAFT holders would receive additional allocations of coins, made on an annual basis, the cumulative sum of which, over time, would equal the value of their original principal investment, in exchange for stretching out the release schedule for their remaining coins,"" Hedera CEO and co-founder Mance Harman wrote in a note Monday.      The offer would incentivize investors to support network usage and growth as well as shore up the price of HBAR, he wrote. The number of additional coins would be equal in value to 10 percent of the company's annual revenue from treasury sales and transaction fees, capped at investors' original investment amount.      The offer is optional; investors who choose not to sign up for the new program will remain on their existing SAFTs without change.      Hedera anticipates the new agreement will extend token distribution schedules by up to 25 percent. For example, investors who originally agreed to receive HBAR over a 48-month period would now wait an additional 12 months for full allocation.      There is no timeframe yet for additional allocations; Hedera has said it will depend on the level of interest the program receives once it's sent out to investors in early 2020.      Designed as a multi-industry scalable decentralized platform, Hedera raised more than $124 million through three rounds in 2018. To comply with U.S. regulations, the sale was only open to accredited investors.

42383088,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9u8Od,1577197850,Chinese Internet Giant Tencent to Launch Digital Currency Research Team,"Tencent, the Chinese internet giant and owner of WeChat, is reportedly forming a team to explore possible new use cases for cryptocurrencies.      According to reports by Chinese media, Tencent issued an internal notice informing employees it was searching for someone to head a new cryptocurrency research unit, which will form part of the company's payments wing.      The new team will look at how to use digital currencies in its payments platform as well as explore other possible business applications. It will also consider how cryptocurrencies could be used within existing and future regulatory regimes.      The research team will reportedly support government initiatives in the area. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is said to view Tencent as a prospective issuer for the digital yuan under development, according to reports in Quartz and CNBC. Reports suggest the new Tencent unit will work on developing the government's pilot digital currency plan in the city of Shenzhen.      Tencent has not denied the reports, but neither has it provided additional information about the research unit nor responded to Chinese media requests for comment. It is unclear whether the team would also consider creating a new cryptocurrency, or focus on supporting applications for the new digital yuan.      Tencent's WeChat Pay is one of the largest payment processors in the world, making up nearly 40 percent of China's multi-trillion dollar mobile payments industry. More than 900 million people used WeChat Pay in 2017, according to Business Insider.      Although very popular in China, WeChat Pay is only available in a handful of other countries. The payments platform is expanding outreach to countries participating in the Chinese government's Belt and Road Initiative but has nonetheless suffered setbacks. The Nepalese government banned WeChat Pay and AliPay earlier this year for not registering with the country's financial regulator.      Tencent has previously said Facebook's Libra project may pose a serious risk to WeChat Pay as it expands outside China. The Chinese government is also reportedly worried about Libra becoming a private alternative to its own digital yuan initiative. A senior official confirmed Tuesday that China would expand the scope of the blockchain cross-border pilot payments platform.      Tencent has had an active and longstanding interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. It published a white paper in 2017 describing a platform offering blockchain services including digital asset management and identity verification.      In October, the company announced it would open a virtual bank to provide financial services leveraging blockchain technology.

42383090,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9u8Pt,1577192400,Looking Backward to Build the Future: How Academia Is Shifting Its Blockchain Focus,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Reuben Youngblom is a programmer with a background in intellectual property law. He co-runs the RegTrax initiative at Stanford University and works with blockchain and other tech startups, providing engineering and legal expertise.      The predictions for 2019 were numerous: it was to be the year of the DAO, the year of the STO, the year of the decentralized exchange, the year of enterprise blockchain, and the year of dapps. All may have been true (or, at least, partially true), but while DAOs were enjoying the limelight, another thread was spinning in the background – quieter, but no less powerful. As it turned out, 2019 was the year that academics started to think about blockchain differently. Design-first thinking and interdisciplinary aspirations jumped out of the slide decks and into the collective consciousness.      Philip Schlump, a professor of computer science at the University of Wyoming, teaches a course called ""Blockchain Design and Programming"" through the College of Engineering and Applied Science. I had the opportunity to speak with him recently and, after getting over my fascination with his life (his answer to, “How did you first get interested in blockchain technology?” started with, “Well, I was raising my kids on a sailboat.”), I asked him about the structure of his class. It’s noteworthy that his course focuses equally on the “design” and the “programming” elements of blockchain, a setup that is fairly foreign to me notwithstanding my computer science background.      “I didn’t want it to be, ‘Here’s a blockchain – go program,’” he said, as if reading my thoughts. “We need to teach why it’s used and, more importantly, learn to contextualize it in terms of how it fits into a project. Why blockchain over a database?”      This design-first approach is exemplary of a shift among blockchain academics over the past year. In a lot of ways, it mirrors a more mature, more introspective industry, wherein it’s no longer enough to just build something and sell tokens. The product needs a place – a place in the market, a place in the regulatory environment, a place in people’s minds. Blockchain does not, and cannot, exist in a vacuum. Schlump is one of many long-time advocates who are actively seeking reasons to not use blockchain, recognizing that stronger use cases often come hand-in-hand with a narrowing of the playing field. With this in mind, academics have started to reformulate their questions. To be sure, we’re still asking how to improve protocols and whether boundaries can be pushed – questions that are as important now as they’ve ever been. However, the shift in thought has introduced new participants, new interests, and new questions. Who and what are we designing for? What are the future consequences of our actions? How does blockchain fit in?    It’s no longer enough to just build something and sell tokens. The product needs a place – a place in the market, a place in the regulatory environment, a place in people’s minds.    Summer Kim, an assistant professor at the U.C. Irvine School of Law, has thought a lot about this.      “UCI Law operates almost like a start-up. I have the opportunity to keep abreast of all the current technology, as I’m sure you do,” she said. “I spend a lot of time considering how new tech can help solve old problems.”      In some ways, Kim’s statement is reminiscent of the ICO boom in 2017, when much lip service was paid to leveraging blockchain to solve everyday problems, many of which may not have actually needed a blockchain-based solution. But here there’s a key distinction, and it makes all the difference. In 2019, academics are, ultimately, trying to build a better world – for others this time, rather than themselves. Kim’s focus is on using blockchain to find new channels for lawyers to create value that will benefit the legal industry at large. Among other things, she’s exploring how decentralization and economic incentives might help the shareholder regain their voice and recently, it seems like this might be possible without risking a tangle with the government. The most common question in academia now is no longer if, but how.      “The big question?” Kim said. “How to turn these aspirational ideas into reality.”      Kim’s words were at the forefront of my mind as I met with Ari Juels, co-director of the Cornell Initiative for CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3). During our conversation, Juels continually came back to one concept in particular – something already woven into the fabric of the IC3, but which is quickly becoming a primary consideration throughout academia.      “What is the best way to move forward in the blockchain space?” I asked him, already knowing what his answer would be.      “Interdisciplinary collaboration,” he said. This philosophy, at least for Juels, extends far beyond the nominal involvement of other departments. Of the five IC3 directors, three are from other institutions, and two of those institutions are based outside the U.S. The IC3 faculty is comprised of researchers from a diverse array of universities with backgrounds ranging from computer science to law to finance. Some disciplines function fine in a bubble, but blockchain, hovering at the intersection of so many fields, philosophies, and governments, simply cannot. Without these other perspectives, our blind spots would be enormous.      Our world may be smaller than ever, but blockchain has destroyed so many barriers, and tied us so tightly together, that a ‘small world’ is no longer an adequate metaphor. Juels, then, thinks about design from the other side of the glass: how ought we build our world to best capture the potential of blockchain? To this end, the IC3 represents movement in the right direction for blockchain in academia. “A global, interdisciplinary organization devoted to the study of blockchain is quite a feat,” I said, and Juels paused, staring into space as one does when they consider how much there is left to do. “You know, one of our internal goals is still to promote more involvement from underrepresented minority groups.”      “Oh.” Always happy, never satisfied.    Moving forward    Over the last year there has been incredible innovation in blockchain, much of it spearheaded by academics. We’ve seen, among other things, the first limited liability DAO out of Vermont, incredible legislative advancement in Wyoming, and an open blockchain ethics course at MIT. We have made tremendous progress.      That said, I hope that next year we take, counterintuitively, a step back. We’ve moved from thinking about how blockchain can circumvent existing infrastructure to thinking about how we might make it work within the confines of existing infrastructure. In 2020, we may want to consider which existing components of our current society will still work well in a Web 3.0 world. Recent scholarship suggests that blockchain may be an interesting way to, say, disrupt public company ownership structures – but maybe the very idea of a public corporation is less applicable in our future than it was in our past. STOs, for example, were once seen as a way to comply with regulatory oversight, but maybe it’s the underlying Howey Test and octogenarian Securities Acts that need to be modernized. Similarly, LAOs may be an interesting possibility for piloting change at the primitive levels of corporate structure.      By reconsidering some of these foundational touchstones, perhaps academics can leverage blockchain to move us forward in our technological evolution. Ultimately, looking backward, at least for a little while, may be the best way to build the future.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Reuben Youngblom,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/24/looking-backward-to-build-the-future-how-academia-is-shifting-its-blockchain-focus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34528e41f79e07fe2248c0b60aee0a64a76e01cb-1306x884.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421794,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXs9WP,1577185200,Out of the Ashes: Four Trends to Shape Crypto in 2020,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Charles Hayter is co-founder and CEO of digital asset data platform CryptoCompare. The views expressed here are his own.      Cast your minds back to the beginning of 2019 and the tenth anniversary of the mining of the bitcoin genesis block. The industry had very little to celebrate. Prices had sunk to new lows, while startups and even some of the industry’s heavyweights were beginning to feel the pinch.      There is a plethora of factors that drive interest in cryptocurrency. Two major dynamics are market volatility and clear examples of mainstream adoption. But there was little of either as the industry entered the new year: large-cap coins flatlined and volumes hit rock bottom. Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley quietly shelved plans to offer cryptocurrencies to their institutional clients. It seemed people had simply stopped caring about digital assets.      Now, as we approach year's end, we can see four major positive trends emerging.      First and perhaps foremost, we have seen rapid experimentation and implementation. A year of breakneck trial and error, development and refinement has seen the cryptocurrency market break into entirely new territory. Popular sportswear manufacturer New Balance began using the Cardano blockchain in its global supply chain; Malta’s Gambling Authority tested cryptocurrency in casinos; and the Bank of France said it will initiate trials for a digital currency in early 2020.      Second, there has been an explosion in the size and accessibility of crypto derivatives. Once the province of less than a handful of exchanges – notably Bitmex – large, established spot venues such as Binance, Huobi and OKEx, now all offer futures and even options on large-cap crypto assets. Looking at BTC Perpetual Futures, we can see how the market is becoming increasingly competitive as major exchanges begin to make inroads.      We are likely to see this trend solidify in 2020 as the dominant spot exchanges flex their considerable muscle in the derivatives market.      Third, decentralized finance (DeFi) has become a hotbed of innovation. The total value of DeFi projects has nearly tripled this year to over $650 million. Leveraging new technologies for the trustless and secure provision of financial services means entirely new lending and margin trading facilities – wholly inconceivable only a few years ago – are now readily available. Traders can now seamlessly swap between different debt positions using InstaDApp, and companies such as Babel Finance in China provide large-scale miners with ready access to capital through crypto as collateral.      Last but not least, the industry has worked hard over the past year to solve some of the problems plaguing cryptocurrencies. New custodial solutions not only help companies and high net worth individuals keep cryptocurrencies secure from hackers, but some even allow remote token staking, meaning holders can secure the network and earn a passive income without putting themselves in harm’s way.      Overall, a great deal of work has been undertaken to establish best practices in the digital asset class. Industry bodies such as Global Digital Finance have worked with members to promote a shared set of professional standards that include a commitment to comply with relevant regulations. Substantial progress has been made worldwide with respect to regulation, encouraging financial market institutions to wake up to the potential of digital assets – both in terms of their ability to change the economic landscape and to offer an uncorrelated asset class. With companies such as JPMorgan beginning to implement their own digital currencies, it is fast becoming clear that even the digital markets’ biggest critics recognise this potential.      A surge of interest in crypto markets came in June with the Facebook Libra announcement: CME Group’s cash-settled bitcoin futures saw open interest hit an all-time high of 5,311 contracts totaling 26,555 BTC, then worth around $246 million.      Also this year, nation-states signaled interest in cryptocurrencies. The Chinese government went from banning citizens from buying cryptocurrencies with renminbi to announcing in October that China fully endorsed blockchain technology and was developing its own state-backed digital currency. Trials are expected to take place in Shenzhen and Suzhou very soon.      In the U.S. too, politicians and regulators have softened their position and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell even hinted at the release of a digital dollar. Cryptocurrencies may well end up playing an important role in shoring up nations’ economic supremacy.      In the private sector, regulated platforms have built out market infrastructure to accommodate mainstream demand. The launch of Bakkt’s physically-settled bitcoin futures in September represented a major step towards providing institutional investors with a regulated means to gain exposure to cryptocurrency. And CME, which first launched its BTC futures in December 2017, is planning to launch options in early 2020, just as Bakkt did earlier this month.      Additional products that have come to market include exchange-traded products on the SIX Swiss exchange offered by Amun and MVIS and powered by CryptoCompare data. A bitcoin ETF may not be in sight just yet, but institutional investors are entering the asset class through alternative instruments. Grayscale Investments, the largest digital currency asset manager, attracted a record $254.9 million in Q3.      Importantly, the data underpinning the markets have seen a major cleanup this year after data providers and the industry as a whole woke up to the problem of ""fake"" volumes and the lack of transparency surrounding trading venues. With more granular metrics now available to rank good and bad actors, the industry is better equipped for decision making.      So as we look back over the last 12 months, the digital asset markets have diversified and grown. New trading facilities allow for more sophisticated strategies, as new service providers turn crypto from fringe asset class to fintech innovation hub. Vital market infrastructure and products tailored to a more sophisticated investor base are now readily available, encouraging traditional firms to enter the asset class. The regulatory framework, though nascent, is providing greater clarity to ensure market participants have a legitimate space to operate in.      We may still be far from the $20,000 bitcoin high in December 2017, but the mainstream foundations are now in place. As cryptocurrency enters its second decade, broad adoption will get well underway.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Charles Hayter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/24/out-of-the-ashes-four-trends-to-shape-crypto-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2956bc33ffce554b98e3eb7a09eb7c214dd7ba10-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
