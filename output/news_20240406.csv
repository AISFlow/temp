In addition to its remarkable rise in DEX and DeFi sectors, Solana’s dominance was further solidified by its scalability, low transaction fees, and robust infrastructure. The massive increase in DEX volume signifies a substantial rise in trading activity within the SOL ecosystem. This trend aligns with the broader adoption of DeFi, with Solana establishing itself as a major player in the space. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dips, But Don’t Panic: ETFs See Three Days Of Bullish Inflow This remarkable increase is described in detail in a new report titled “State of Solana Q1 2024” by on-chain analytics company Messari.

Solana DEX Volume Skyrockets Solana’s DeFi total value locked, a metric that represents the total value of cryptocurrency locked within DeFi protocols on a blockchain, surged by over 200% to nearly $5 billion, placing it fourth among all networks.

This surge was primarily driven by USDC, the leading stablecoin, whose market capitalization on Solana increased by an impressive 110% to slightly above $2 billion. This growth reflects a rise in trust and adoption of stablecoins on the Solana blockchain, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of traditional assets like the US dollar, offering stability in a volatile market. SOL market cap currently at $77.5 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Solana Price Volatility A Concern Despite the positive indicators, the report also acknowledges some potential drawbacks. While the high trading volume is a positive sign, the fact that meme coins are a major contributor raises questions about the long-term sustainability of this growth.

True to his foresight, Bitcoin dropped to around the projected price target by December of the same year. Now, using technical analysis based on the Elliott Wave principle, Bluntz has shared a price chart displaying Near protocol’s potential rally to over $10. NEAR market cap currently at $7.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The Elliott Wave theory, developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott is a technical methodology that analyzes recurrent and long-term price patterns related to persistent changes in investor sentiment and psychology. This technical tool is used to predict the price movements of cryptocurrencies based on greed and fear. Bluntz provided two charts depicting Near Protocol’s price movements against Tether (USDT) and another against Bitcoin. In both charts, Near Protocol had undergone a sequence of price fluctuations, moving between green and red zones before exhibiting strong price fundamentals that could potentially propel its price above $10. The crypto analyst has pinpointed a projected timeline for this price surge around mid April, specifically before the 15th. Insights Into NEAR’s Recent Price Movements Over the past month, the price of Near Protocol has been on a steady upward trend, boasting an impressive 26% increase. Moreover, the cryptocurrency’s total market capitalization has risen by over 6%, accompanied by a 25% increase in its 24-hour trading volume. Related Reading: Trouble Ahead?

The network recently hit a new milestone in terms of transactions processed so far, in addition to other bullish fundamentals that could also contribute to the price surge. Cardano Has Processed Over 88 Million Transactions Data from Cardano’s latest weekly development report shows that the network has processed 88.6 million transactions to date. This is significant as sustained network activity can positively affect ADA’s price. Moreover, ADA has always been criticized as a “ghost chain,” this achievement dispels that notion and proves that people are actively using the network. Related Reading: XRP To $20 And Ethereum To $20,000: Crypto Analyst Reveals When This Will Happen Source: Essential Cardano Meanwhile, the report revealed that 1,353 projects are actively building on the network, which means the network will keep expanding as more users get onboarded through those projects. Additionally, Cardano’s Fund12 officially launches on April 26, with this decentralized and innovative incubator program set to usher in a new set of developers into the Cardano ecosystem. That event also underlines Cardano’s potential to experience exponential network growth soon enough. It is also a testament to Cardano founder Charles Hoskison’s statement that the network is growing organically like Bitcoin, seeing as the team has continued to put in the work rather than solely depending on hype. Considering these bullish developments, ADA’s price could be well primed for a significant move to the upside. This will provide a much-needed relief for ADA holders who have continued to worry about the crypto token’s lagging price action. ADA’s price had remained pretty tepid despite the broader crypto market recording massive price gains. ADA Price Chart Says Otherwise From a technical analysis perspective, the Cardano ecosystem is currently bearish. Technical analyst Alan Santana recently mentioned that further price declines are more feasible as ADA’s price has continued to lag. He revealed that ADA’s weekly chart is producing a “break below the EMA10 (Exponential Moving Average) with a very strong bearish candle as the RSI (Relative Strength Index) turns red. “ Related Reading: Dogecoin Finds A Bottom: How The 7-Year Cycle Can Send Price To $40 Santana also suggested that ADA’s price could drop to as low as $0.34 in a bid to establish support. Therefore, he stated that the “only wise decision is to remain bearish until the chart and market conditions change.” “Once support is found and established, we become bullish again,” the analyst added. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.58, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This is further bolstered by three consecutive sessions of net inflows into these investment vehicles. Related Reading: Solana Primed For Takeoff? Expert Analysis Points To Buying Opportunity Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Long-Term Investor Appetite A recent dip in ETF activity sparked fears that the initial excitement might be short-lived. However, those fears have been quelled by a resurgence in inflows. According to data from SoSoValue, yesterday saw a net inflow of $203 million into Bitcoin spot ETFs, marking the third straight day of positive inflow. This sustained green streak suggests that investors remain interested in gaining exposure to the top crypto through ETFs, potentially anticipating a price surge due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving – a pre-programmed code update that cuts production in half, historically leading to price increases. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Leads The Pack BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has emerged as a frontrunner in the crypto ETF space. Their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded the highest net inflow on a single day, exceeding $144 million. BTC market cap currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com This impressive figure has pushed IBIT’s total net inflow over the past two weeks to over $14 billion. BlackRock’s commitment to Bitcoin ETFs is further underscored by their recent decision to include prominent Wall Street institutions like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Citadel Securities, and UBS as Authorized Participants (APs) in their spot Bitcoin ETF prospectus. These additions position these banking giants as first-time participants in the ETF market, joining established players like JPMorgan and Jane Street. The inclusion of such heavyweights is seen as a significant vote of confidence in the future of Bitcoin ETFs and a potential catalyst for further mainstream adoption. Volatility On The Horizon For ETFs While the recent surge in demand paints a bullish picture for Bitcoin ETFs, experts warn that volatility may be lurking on the horizon. CryptoQuant, a cryptocurrency analysis platform, points to signals in the futures market that suggest potential price swings in the near future. Related Reading: Trouble Ahead? Binance Coin Futures Market Under Pressure With Negative Funding Rates A consistently high premium often signifies strong institutional buying pressure, particularly in light of the recent inflows witnessed in US Bitcoin ETFs. This increased institutional activity can contribute to price fluctuations, creating opportunities for both gains and losses. Despite the potential for short-term volatility, the overall outlook for Bitcoin ETFs remains positive. The sustained demand, coupled with the backing of major financial institutions like BlackRock, suggests that these investment vehicles are poised to play a significant role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world.

Arbitrum, which has a lot of potential with a market cap of over $3.8 billion and a circulating supply of 2,653,939,384 ARB has been trading below the 100-day Moving Average (MA) for some time now. However, recently the price of ARB has been showing some signs of reversing. As of the time of writing, Arbitrum was trading around $1.45, indicating an increase of 1% in the last 24 hours. There are currently two major resistance levels of $1.799 and $2.278 ahead of the price. Technical Indicators Show Signs Of Upward Movement In Arbitrum Price 4-hour RSI Indicator: Looking at the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, we can see that the RSI line is rising above the oversold zone and is heading toward the 50 level. This indicates a rise in the price, and if the RSI line rises above the 50 level, it might trigger the start of a new trend. The image below reveals more: 4-hour MACD: looking at the formation of the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe in the above image, we can also see that both the MACD line and the signal line having trended for a while below the MACD zero line have both crossed and are heading towards the MACD zero line. On the other hand, the MACD histogram is already trending above the MACD zero line. This suggests that a change in direction might soon happen from its downward movement to an upward movement. 1-hour bull power vs bear power histogram indicator: lastly, taking a good look at the chart from the 1-hour time frame with the help of the bull power vs bear power indicator, it shows that the histograms are already trending above the zero level. This suggests that buyers are gradually taking over the market from sellers as seen in the image below. In conclusion, if the price of Arbitrum manages to change its direction from downward to upward direction, it is possible that ARB could retest its previous major resistance levels of $1.799 and $2.278 and even move further to create a new peak. Nonetheless, if Arbitrum fails to move upward, the crypto asset’s price might move further downward to create a new low.

25300993,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601718,1712390431,Cardano Price In Turmoil: Can Whales Drive ADA’s Resurrection From Recent Dump?,"The Cardano price has been facing a significant amount of bearish pressure over the past week, declining by more than 12%. This recent fall coincides with a broader crypto market downturn, with other major altcoins suffering huge losses over the past week. Specifically, Cardano’s price decline has been largely linked to the recent sell-off of all ADA holdings by the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC). On Thursday, April 4, the fund disclosed its decision to rebalance its portfolio by liquidating its Cardano assets (about 1.6% of the entire holdings). Registering such a negative start to April after an underwhelming performance in March doesn’t do well to dispel the increasing concerns of investors. Moreover, the latest on-chain data suggests that the Cardano price might continue to succumb to the bearish pressure. Analyst Predicts ADA Price Slump As Whale Activity Slows Down Popular crypto pundit Ali Martinez has shared a post on X that Cardano whales have been making fewer moves in the market in recent days. This revelation is based on Santiment’s Whale Transaction Count metric, which tracks the number of ADA transactions worth more than $1 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Go On 1.2 Million BTC Buying Spree, Is Retail Finally Here? Whales refer to entities or individuals that own significant amounts of a particular cryptocurrency (Cardano, in this case). They are often viewed as key players in the market, as their buying or selling activities can have a significant impact on the Cardano price, leading to speculation and potential market shifts. According to Martinez, the on-chain data shows that there has been a noticeable dip in the activity of Cardano whales, suggesting a possible decline in significant ADA transactions. In an almost vertical move, the whale transaction count dropped from around 400 daily transactions at the beginning of last week to 200 daily transactions by Friday, April 5. Chart showing ADA whale transaction count, whale holdings, and price | Source: Ali_charts/X The crypto analyst mentioned that the recent downturn in whale activity could be a signal for “further price consolidation” or an imminent decline in the Cardano price. A loss of substantial buying activity from large investors can cause the cryptocurrency to succumb to bearish pressure, especially from small traders looking to take some profit. Indeed, the Cardano token has made a positive start to the year, reaching a high of $0.8 in early March. However, the altcoin has been on a downward trend since hitting the 2024 peak – collapsing under the pressure of Bitcoin’s price decline. Cardano Price At A Glance As of this writing, the Cardano price stands at around $0.577, reflecting a 1% decline in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Solana Primed For Takeoff?

Marathon Digital recorded a net income of over $200 billion in Q4-23 due to changes in accounting rules, but I calculate Q4 breakeven BTC price at $43.7k. Balance sheet management has been impressive with strong liquidity and a large reduction in debt. From a P/S valuation standpoint, MARA is already pricing in a six figure BTC price. When I last covered Marathon Digital ( MARA ) for Seeking Alpha in December, the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) network was experiencing a dramatic surge in transaction fees as a percentage of total block reward. The potential long term stickiness of transaction fees would be hugely beneficial to BTC miners like Marathon because it would minimize the impact of emission halvings - the next of which is roughly two weeks away as of article submission. Miner reward distribution (IntoTheBlock) In the months since that article, transaction fees have failed to live up to the excitement from Q4 2023. While we could theoretically see transaction fees move back up in the future, I suspect the more BTC that flows into the spot ETFs the less likely that outcome may ultimately be. Thus, I'm providing an update. We'll look at the company's forward guidance from its recent report, Q1-24 production data, and assess whether or not MARA is a fundamental buy at a $5 billion valuation. Q4-23 Performance Data by YCharts In the last quarter for 2023, Marathon Digital recorded $156.8 million in quarterly revenue versus $185.3 million in total expenses. What likely jumps off the page is the monstrous positive quarterly net income figure of over $200 million. How could this be with expenses exceeding sales? CFO Salman Khan on the last conference call: Had the company not early adopted the new FASB fair-value accounting rules, our net income attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2023 would have been a net loss of $5 million or loss of $0.02 per diluted share. And net income of $33 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the year ended December 31st, 2023. For the full year, MARA produced 12,853 BTC and grew its Bitcoin treasury stack by 2,942 BTC year over year. From a cost of production standpoint, there was a notable move higher in MARA's breakeven price for Q4 based on my own estimates. But trailing twelve months, the company's production costs were actually much better than most other players in the industry. Q1-23 Q2-23 Q3-23 Q4-23 TTM Cost of Revenues $33,400,000 $55,200,000 $59,600,000 $75,100,000 $223,300,000 Adjusted Opex $21,600,000 $42,800,000 $53,900,000 $110,300,000 $228,600,000 BTC Mined 2,195 2,926 3,490 4,242 12,853 Breakeven Price $25,057 $33,493 $32,521 $43,706 $35,159 Sources: Seeking Alpha, Marathon Digital, Author's calculations I do want to mention that these breakeven figures are not meant to be taken as gospel, they are simply an external estimate that can be equally applied to all of the companies in the space to gauge efficiency among peers over time. If we strip out those FASB accounting changes and build a real time breakeven Bitcoin price for MARA that combines cost of revenue, SG&A, and Depreciation/Amortization and then divide that figure by the amount of BTC the company produces each quarter, we get a $43.7k breakeven BTC price for Marathon Digital in Q4 and a $35.1k BTC price for the full year 2023. Current State and Forward Guidance Author's chart (Marathon Digital) As of end of March, Marathon Digital has 17,381 BTC on the balance sheet. At a coin price of $68k, MARA has nearly $1.2 billion in liquidity from BTC alone. The company is in a much better financial position than it was a year ago following the depths of crypto winter. Over the last several quarters, Marathon Digital has done a nice job growing assets while also lowering debt: Data by YCharts Much of this asset growth has come at the expense of shareholder dilution, but with the price of MARA shares up over 400% since the end of 2022, anyone who bought the capitulation in December of that year has substantially outpaced the dilution since that time: Data by YCharts On the conference call, CEO Fred Thiel mentioned just how different the setup is for miners today compared to a year ago when BTC was trading under $25k per coin and the company had more debt than liquidity: We have $1 billion of liquidity on our balance sheet and have reduced debt by over $411 million, while saving our shareholders $100 billion in the process, resulting in net debt of $331 million. What Marathon has pulled off regarding the balance sheet is admittedly impressive. Thiel went on to mention the company plans to take control of about half the of their total hash rate and we're already seeing some of those dominos falling with Marathon recently agreeing to buy Applied Digital's ( APLD ) data center in Garden City, Texas for $87 million. MARA has historically used APLD for Bitcoin mining hosting services. According to Marathon, this deal will reduce mining cost at that site by 20%. Investor Deck, Slide 3 (Marathon Growth) Looking ahead, Marathon Digital is eying substantial exahash growth through the remainder of this year and into 2025. 35 EH/s by the end of this year would be 42% growth from the end of 2023. 50 EH/s by 2025 would be roughly double the year end level. Thiel mentioned that it will be possible for this timeline to be accelerated if opportunities to do so manifest; which is likely a reference to post-halving consolidation that figures to happen when weak mining outfits tap out and turn off machines. Q1 Production Author's chart (Marathon Digital) Despite the phenomenal production metrics for most of 2023, Q1 was not particularly great for MARA both from a total BTC mined standpoint and from an efficiency perspective. After mining at least 1,000 BTC in 7 consecutive months between July and January, Marathon has averaged just 864 BTC over February and March. While Q1 production was up year over year, growth has come at the long term expense of BTC per EH/s efficiency: Author's chart (Marathon Digital) Marathon's BTC per EH/s numbers have been broadly trending down for over a year and it speaks to the fundamental problem with everyone in the business chasing share gains from what is a shrinking nominal BTC pie: Data by YCharts To call Bitcoin network global hash parabolic would probably be appropriate. The hope for companies like MARA is that they can grow share of global hash rate against their peers. To this point, the company has been able to accomplish that several quarters running. But even assuming Marathon can hit its scaling objectives, the block reward halving later this month is a major long term headwind. Already Priced For Perfection? If we take MARA's 2024 year end guidance for EH/s and calculate what we could reasonably expect annualized revenue to be in a post-halving environment, we get $1.1 billion in annual revenue from mining at a BTC price of $100k: BTC Price 30 Eh/s 35 Eh/s $60,000 $587,520,000 $685,440,000 $70,000 $685,440,000 $799,680,000 $80,000 $783,360,000 $913,920,000 $90,000 $881,280,000 $1,028,160,000 $100,000 $979,200,000 $1,142,400,000 $150,000 $1,468,800,000 $1,713,600,000 $200,000 $1,958,400,000 $2,284,800,000 $250,000 $2,448,000,000 $2,856,000,000 Source: Author's calculations This calculation makes some assumptions on post-halving efficiency and production. Specifically, I'm using a trailing twelve month weighted average monthly EH/s of 54.4 and cutting it down to 27.2 for my post-halving BTC per EH/s estimate. This obviously doesn't take a change in global hash rate or Marathon's share of global hash into consideration. But at 30 EH/s, MARA would be mining 816 BTC post-halving. At 35 EH/s they're at 952. Like the breakeven price earlier in the article, take this more as a back of the envelope estimate rather than as a forecast. In any case, this methodology has MARA shares already trading at about 3x forward sales at a $150k BTC price - or more than double today's Bitcoin price. The forward P/S sector median for info tech is 2.9. This estimate also assumes Marathon Digital sells production after the halving and history is an indication that the company generally doesn't do that. Other Considerations I've been writing about Bitcoin miners for Seeking Alpha for nearly two years. Over that time, I've been pretty clear that I don't personally view BTC mining companies as great long term investments. I think they're really great for traders and for that reason I still do hold some MARA shares. But if you're buying MARA for the BTC stack, you're likely going to continue getting diluted over time: Author's chart (Seeking Alpha, Marathon Digital) In the chart above, I'm showing nearly a three year trend in quarterly shares outstanding and BTC per MARA share. Over the last five quarters, the BTC per share for MARA shareholders has been nearly cut in half. This isn't meant to say MARA is necessarily a bad BTC proxy bet as much as it's just to point out each investor should be mindful of what their personal objective is. Investor Takeaway If you're trying to optimize swing trades and own companies that have BTC-denominated revenue streams, MARA works very well for that. You just need to be prepared for the volatility. However, if you're simply trying to increase your exposure to BTC specifically, the newly approved spot ETFs are probably a much better long term option. I'm personally still holding MARA shares because I think some of the more long term goals are actually fairly interesting; specifically wasted heat and stranded gas opportunities. But those are highly speculative at this juncture. On the merits of what the underlying business is today, I think spot ETFs are the better way to express a $150k BTC thesis than MARA at $19. If transaction fees have a comeback, that might change things for me. But the more BTC that gets sucked up by ETF managers, the less active addresses I'd expect to see paying fees on chain.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4682455-marathon-digital-priced-big-btc-gains-already-mara-stock-bitcoin-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/25296443.jpeg

This report also stated that a significant portion of the newly acquired tokens came from retail traders, i.e., holders of 0-100 BTC, who collectively offloaded 105,260 BTC, valued at $7.2 billion and 0.7% of BTC’s circulating supply, within the same time frame. 🐳↗️ #Bitcoin‘s key stakeholders with 100-100K $BTC have ACCUMULATED a collective 319,310 $BTC (around 1.4% of the supply) in the past 3 months.

For context, the Bitcoin halving, which occurs every four years, is a network-programmed event during which the amount of miners’ rewards on the Bitcoin blockchain is reduced by half. Generally, the Bitcoin halving is regarded as a positive event that results in asset scarcity, thus driving up demand and market price in the long term. This notion may just remain true as Santiment describes the increased accumulation by BTC whales heading into the final weeks before the next halving as a bullish signal, indicating high confidence in the asset’s future valuation.

Cardano’s Founder Thinks So, Community Pokes At Solana","Cardano (ADA)’s founder is a man of many words and many GIFs. Charles Hoskinson’s comments, whether you agree or disagree with them, tend to spark discussions in the crypto community. Hoskinson’s latest X reply spree covered issues from dating advice to his confidence in the ecosystem to Solana’s recent struggles. As a result, several conversations regarding those topics and Cardano’s founder’s perspectives on them spread across the X platform. Related Reading: Cardano Price Tumbles As Grayscale Sells All ADA From Large Cap Fund Charles Hoskinson’s Dating Advice Charles Hoskinson offered some crypto-related dating advice in a reply to Lily Brodi, the creator of the viral ‘Cardano Girls’ video. The content creator asked whether it was weird to ask someone on the first day if they held ADA. Cardano’s founder replied that not holding ADA was a “major red flag” at this point. Hoskinson jokingly insinuated that the person might “not be a cannibal,” but if they don’t hold Cardano’s native token, you should be alert anyway. At this point, not holding ada is a major red flag. I mean I'm not saying they are cannibals, but… pic.twitter.com/s2CzXr2Hxr — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) April 4, 2024 Later, he suggested he might know one or two eligible “Cardano bachelors.” The community found Hoskinson’s comments funny, with some agreeing with his perspective on potential partners. Nonetheless, not all Hoskinson’s replies during his Wednesday spree were well received. Cardano’s founder seemingly took a jab at Solana after learning of the blockchain’s recent struggle to process transactions. The post informed us of the levels of congestion that the Solana network is experiencing. According to Dune data, the Solana blockchain currently has a non-vote transaction failure rate of over 75%. Three out of four transactions are experiencing issues before even making it to the block. The failure rate seems to occur “because many bots engaging in arbitrage generate spam transactions.” To the news, Hoskinson replied with a popular gif of actor Pedro Pascal enjoying himself. This guy is exactly why Cardano ngmi Cardano has a douchebag founder https://t.co/Xn0Dj1VDsG — LawrenceOfCrypto.sol (@LawrenceCrypt0) April 5, 2024 This reply prompted some X users to criticize Cardano’s Founder. Some even called him a “douchebag founder” and claimed that answers like that are the reason why the project “won’t make it.” However, the ADA community joined in the criticism of the Solana network. Some community members deemed the chain as “useless.” Another ADA holder stated: “The Solana team does not know the basic principles of how blockchain works.” The comments don’t come as a surprise as both communities’ ongoing “feud” tends to end in a jab and poking fun at each other’s struggles. “Cardano Always Wins” Or Does It? As part of Hoskinson’s recent “insight,” he commented on a recent poll ranking the best Layer-1 networks. In said poll, the Cardano ecosystem had the second-highest number of voters. Nonetheless, its founder didn’t seem pleased, claiming that “It was engineered to produce an outcome prior to a single vote being cast.” To Hoskinson, in a “fair vote,” it is clear that “Cardano always wins.” Despite his confidence in the project, the ADA price has recently shown a subpar performance. The token has exhibited red numbers in several timeframes, with an 11.5% drop in the last seven days and a 20.5% decrease in the past month. The token’s current performance has not gone unnoticed by analysts either. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez raised some concerns about ADA’s whale activity. According to Martinez, “Cardano is experiencing a lull in whale activity.” The analyst considers that this could signal a potential for further price consolidation or an impending drop. The unclear trajectory of ADA’s price seems concerning to its holders, as some consider its current performance to be “extremely bearish right now.” At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.5748, a level not seen since Valentine’s Day.

Related Reading: This Bitcoin Indicator May Have Signaled Latest Market Downturn In Advance How the market would be affected by the moves from these humongous entities depends on what they intend to do with those moves. Naturally, it’s impossible to say what an investor plans to do confidently. The type of addresses involved in the transaction, however, can sometimes at least provide a hint about what the whale may have wanted to achieve with the move. Below are the details of the latest Dogecoin whale transaction, which reveals its relevant addresses. Looks like this massive move only required a negligible fee of $0.03 to be possible on the Dogecoin blockchain | Source: Whale Alert As is visible, this Dogecoin transaction was executed from a wallet connected to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The destination of the move appears to have been a couple of unknown addresses. An unknown address refers to a wallet not affiliated with any centralized entity like an exchange (the sender in this transfer is a “known” wallet as it’s attached to a central entity in Binance). Generally, such addresses are the investors’ personal, self-custodial wallets. Transfers where coins move in the direction of exchanges to self-custodial entities are known as “exchange outflows.” Usually, investors make such moves when they plan to hold onto their coins long-term, as it’s safer to do so outside of these platforms, where the platforms control the wallets. Exchange outflows can also sometimes be an indication that fresh buying is going on, as some investors like to immediately withdraw their purchases of these platforms. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Capitulate: $5.2 Billion Sold At Loss Given the relatively massive scale of the Dogecoin exchange outflow in the current case, it can naturally be bullish news for investors if the whale is indeed accumulating here. However, the scenario also exists where the whale has withdrawn to sell through the peer-to-peer (P2P) mode. In this case, the effect on the asset could be bearish instead.

25285085,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601680,1712361634,FOMO Gives Way To Fear: Bitcoin-Ethereum Ratio Signals Shift In Crypto Sentiment,"The recent ratio between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices suggests a potential decline in risk appetite within the crypto market. The ratio has reached its highest level since April 2021, indicating a stronger demand for Bitcoin than its smaller rival, Ethereum. This development has led crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital to speculate that this shift in the ratio could be an early indication of a transition from “fear of missing out” (FOMO) to outright fear. Bitcoin And Ethereum Performance Regarding recent market trends, the second quarter of 2024 has begun with relatively subdued activity. Bitcoin’s price has dipped below the $70,000 mark and has remained range-bound between $65,000 and $68,000 for the past few days despite briefly touching the $70,000 mark on Monday. Related Reading: XRP To $20 And Ethereum To $20,000: Crypto Analyst Reveals When This Will Happen According to QCP’s analysis, the inflow of funds into the spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) market has not been substantial enough to drive significant price movements in either direction. As a result, the company has observed that funding rates have stabilized, and the front end of the forward curve has declined from previous highs of 50% to less than 20% currently. Interestingly, while the front end of the forward curve has decreased, the back end remains elevated. This has led to interest in rolling spot-forward basis positions further out, potentially driven by the continued demand for long-dated Bitcoin calls extending into 2025. On the other hand, Ethereum’s performance has been relatively weak. QCP also notes that the ETHBTC ratio cross-tests a critical support level after breaking below 0.05. Notably, there has been sustained selling of Ethereum calls, resulting in lower volatility and downward pressure on the price. Ultimately, QCP finds that these developments are prompting speculation as to whether this could be an early sign of FOMO turning into fear, particularly about Ethereum’s role as a proxy for altcoins. While Bitcoin may find support from topside demand and ETF inflows, Ethereum’s performance and its impact on altcoins will be important factors to watch closely. Will BTC Experience A Double-Top? Renowned crypto analyst Crypto Con has raised an intriguing question about whether BTC is poised for a double top similar to the patterns observed in 2013 and 2021. Analyzing previous market cycles, Crypto Con highlights that more evident double tops, such as those witnessed in the first and third cycles of 2021, triggered significant initial surges on the Fisher Transform indicator. In contrast, the 2017 double-top formation showed a more subtle initial rise in June. Notably, all final cycle tops ended with a regular bearish divergence, where the price reached higher levels while the indicator declined, as seen in the chart below. Related Reading: Polygon Observes Buy Signal: Analyst Suggests MATIC Rebound To This Level Currently, Bitcoin is approaching levels similar to those seen in 2017, as seen in the lower part of the chart. Crypto Con suggests that if the Fisher Transform indicator can consolidate around these levels without spiking to the line seen in 2013 and 2021, it could indicate a higher likelihood of a single top formation, which is the analyst’s most likely outcome, for December 2024, marking the top of this cycle.
