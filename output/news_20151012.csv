42426575,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZph,1444686923,Inside Multichain: A Build-Your-Own Blockchain Service for Banks,"""Blockchain technology"" may be the buzzword of the moment in the FinTech world, but like any blanket term, actual definitions vary.  Rather than any one solution, it may be beneficial to think of blockchain technology as a loosely defined set of goals financial institutions are hoping to unlock through distributed ledgers. The transition finds these entities seeking to define the attributes of the bitcoin blockchain they prefer – its secure ledger and payments rail – and the ones they don't – its controversy-grabbing native asset and largely anonymous miners, while determining solutions that allow them to further define these needs.  Entrepreneurs are now stepping in to facilitate this education process, attempting to serve a clientele that is unique from that of the industry surrounding the bitcoin blockchain. Among them are private blockchain firms such as Blockstack, Eris Ltd and Coin Sciences.  Led by CEO and founder Gideon Greenspan, Coin Sciences recently launched a new solution this summer called the Multichain Private Blockchain. The product takes what could be described as a build-your-own blockchain approach that aims to free banks from the more rigid options of competing offerings.  Greenspan believes there's potential profit in allowing banks to experiment with the technology while gleaning insights into their observations, telling CoinDesk:  ""It became clear that what [banks] were doing is grabbing their best developers, pointing them at the source code for Ethereum and Bitcoin Core and telling them to start tinkering with it... We saw the opportunity to create an off-the-shelf platform where they don't need to spend a year breaking their heads on this stuff.""  Multichain is the latest offering from Coin Sciences, following CoinSpark, a software tool for web assets and legal contracts on the bitcoin blockchain. The problem, Greenspan alleges, wasn't that financial institutions weren't interested in this solution, or removing intermediaries from financial processes, but rather they didn't believe the bitcoin blockchain was tested or stable enough for their needs.  ""It became clear people are looking for things that are similar to bitcoin but different, rather than cryptocurrencies, traditional entities are more interested in the ledger,"" Greenspan said.  In this light, Multichain emphasizes end-user choice, allowing customers to control whether the chain is private or public; the target time for blocks; who can connect to the network; how these entities interact; and the maximum block size and metadata that can be included in transactions, among other features.  Moreover, Greenspan argues the offering is proving popular, having been downloaded nearly 850 times from mid-June to mid-Septemberr. He declined to mention any large financial clients that may be using the software.  The alpha version of the platform is currently available, with a beta to be released in late 2015.  'Bitcoin's shortcomings'  As in the Multichain white paper, Greenspan is keen in conversation to elaborate on why his firm believes bitcoin is ill-suited for the needs of financial conglomerates, while steering clear of suggesting the bitcoin blockchain is not a needed innovation.  The paper, for example, seeks to note that bitcoin currently supports only 300,000 transactions per day due to the current limit on how many megabytes worth of data can be processed on the network every 10 minutes. Further, it argues that bitcoin's fees – roughly 2.5 cents for a transaction at the time of publication – are set to rise as the number of new bitcoins produced to incentivize miners for transaction processing decreases, both factors that simply don't appeal to institutional users.  Complicating matters, Greenspan argues, is that the blockchain is designed to move bitcoins, meaning that it can only effectively exchange a record of the asset, not the asset itself.  ""That conceptual idea ... doesn't carry over to other assets. Unless another asset has been issued, like dollars onto a blockchain, you're never going to be directly an asset. You're always going to be owning a promise that that assets exists,"" Greenspan said.  Notably, startups such as Symbiont are developing technology to represent asset ownership on the blockchain, though financial giants such as Nasdaq have offered a differing view. In a recent interview, Fredrik Voss, Nasdaq's head of blockchain strategy, for instance, argued that bitcoin representations of assets are still beneficial due to the tracking benefits shared ledgers provide.  Multichain, however, believes its workaround will find a market. As described in the white paper, the technology aims to make tracking blockchain assets easier using bitcoin's scripting language to encode metadata in transaction outputs, which it argues allows miners to verify the quantity of an asset that differs from the network's native token in any transactions.  Customizable permissions  Like other private blockchain solutions, Multichain aims to remove perceived problems associated with bitcoin by limiting the visibility of the ledger to certain participants, allowing institutions to set controls on transactions permitted and by forgoing distributed mining.  On the subject of privacy, Multichain allows users to set a list of permitted users that can act as nodes that refer information on the network and 'miners' that verify transactions, including a method by which nodes can verify whether other nodes have been approved.  Privileges are granted using transactions with special metadata, and the miner of the Genesis block, the first block on the blockchain, is given all established rights on the network and acts an 'administrator'. This administrator can then appoint other administrators on the network, with any changes to consensus needed to be validated by a set number of participants.  Permissions can also be grated on a limited basis, according to the white paper, or to a fixed range of block numbers.  This differs from the current consensus strategy in bitcoin, in which a distributed community of developers must introduce changes that then require a majority or all of those processing transactions on the network to upgrade to new versions of the software.  Though often not difficult technically, the challenge inherent in this approach was perhaps best exemplified by the ongoing debate on the size of blocks on the bitcoin network. Differing proposals have been introduced as far back as this summer, though no consensus on solutions has so far been reached.  Proof of work alternative  As miners on the multichain network do not need to conduct proof of work, Multichain has also introduced a novel way by which these entities can trust decisionmaking.  Called mining diversity, the process enables miners processing transactions to approve transactions in a random rotation. Greenspan explained a situation in which a Multichain user set a blockchain network with 10 mining entities, and set a ""relatively high"" mining difficulty by which the approval eight of these entities would be needed for a block to be recorded.  ""That means they have to wait eight more blocks before they sign another one. Having that, what it means is there's no possibility for a small group of miners to mine a chain in private, unless eight of them do it,"" he said.  Greenspan argues that this structure allows more miners to participate in the approval of transactions, while ensuring there is no fixed order of verification that could be corrupted.  Transaction fees and block rewards are set to zero by default in Multichain, though this is also customizable, as the white paper suggests participants could be charged a yearly service fee.  Still, Greenspan believes that version of a private blockchain offers benefits over a centralized database, a claim often espoused by critics, contending that the benefits are that each participant retains full control over assets; control of the database is distributed across entities; and that, due to the mining diversity concept, the loss of any one server would not compromise the network.  ""This is a new type of database that enables multiple parties to share a database and to be able to modify that in a safe and secure way even if they don't trust each other. I think that's a very valid direction and new types of databases can be an extremely powerful thing.""  Missing link  Multichain users also aren't limited to the number of blockchains they create, and further, they have the ability to connect their blockchains to the bitcoin network or to a bitcoin testnet, a version of the blockchain on which no real bitcoins move.  Interoperability, however, is so far limited to bitcoin, as Greenspan said Multichain cannot connect to Ripple or Ethereum, which he said were ""in a separate world from Multichain"".  ""Bitcoin's model is hugely more scalable,"" Greenspan continued. ""You can run many transactions in parallel as long as you can see they're not modifying the same data.""  In contrast to these alternatives, Greenspan still sees bitcoin as a preferred technology, basing Multichain off of a fork of Bitcoin Core, using the protocol and architecture as well as its command-line and API interface.  In this way, the Multichain white paper positions private blockchains as an early version of a more robust, global bitcoin blockchain, one that can allow private institutions to begin working with the technology in the way that Intranets exposed entities to the Internet.  ""Private blockchains will likely be a more attractive solution for financial institutions wishing to deploy this technology during the next decade,"" the paper reads, adding:  ""Twenty years from now, if bitcoin or another blockchain is processing billions of transactions monthly at very low cost, with mining controlled by large identifiable corporations, bitcoin may start looking like an attractive platform for institutional financial transactions.""

Eleven customers had their accounts emptied, according to Purse representatives, who reported they had covered the bitcoins withdrawn with company funds.  Claims that funds were stolen first emerged over the weekend, with customers reporting that they had received emails about password resets and withdrawals. Purse.io’s website was later taken offline for several hours.  The bitcoin-focused e-commerce company said on 11th October that it believed one of its email service providers had been compromised. At the time, the company said that ""all funds are secure"".  CEO Andrew Lee told CoinDesk that funds controlled by the company were temporarily moved into an offline wallet following the shutdown, including its profit accounts, while the team began investigating the thefts.  “We actively monitor our customer liabilities against the funds we control. During our downtime, we determined funds we control exceeded customer liabilities [and] the unauthorized withdrawals (10.235 BTC) implying user funds were secure,"" he said in an email. ""Profit from one to two days was used to reimburse the withdrawals.”  Lee added that Purse “will publish technical details of the attack in the coming days”. He also denied reports that funds were stolen from accounts with active two-factor authentication (2FA).  “No accounts with 2FA enabled before the attack were affected. Reports of accounts with 2FA being compromised are not accurate. Some users enabled 2FA after they received reset password emails,” he said.

42426577,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZrh,1444660859,Scorechain Raises $570k for European Bitcoin Compliance Solution,"Bitcoin compliance solutions provider Scorechain has raised €500,000 ($570,000) in seed funding from an undisclosed group of angel investors.  The Luxembourg-based startup is seeking to target both bitcoin companies and traditional financial institutions with a suite of services that help clients meet regulatory and compliance requirements, through business intelligence and risk analysis tools that illuminate transaction histories on the blockchain.  CEO Pierre Gerard suggested Scorechain will attempt to appeal to bitcoin startups that are beginning to implement more stringent know-your-customer and anti-money laundering policies by offering a web interface as well as an API.  However, Gerard also sees the service being useful for a market that is increasingly interested in the digital currency industry – major financial institutions.  Gerard told CoinDesk:  ""Banks are learning more about customers using bitcoin. If someone is coming with €100,000 in cash, pretending it's coming from bitcoin, we can allow a compliance officer from a bank to check if the person is telling the truth. All the banks today need to check where the money is coming from, if it's from bitcoin, we provide this.""  Gerard said Scorechain's solution is optimized for the European market, and that its service is able to build custom reports for companies in different nations, with the information it collects varying depending on local regulatory needs.  The startup's emphasis on Europe, he said, will also be beneficial, given there is less competition among compliance providers than in the US, which is home to startups such as IdentityMind.  Today, Scorechain has four full-time employees, according to its CEO, with funding being used to expand the team to six. The service is currently operating in free beta, though Gerard said the company is now exploring pricing models.  Blockchain analysis  Users of the service who want to obtain more information about a bitcoin transaction or wallet address are able to leverage its ""Lookup"" tool to see details, such as how much bitcoin was sent and the fees that were paid to include the transaction on the blockchain.  Both metrics are provided in a colorful screen layout alongside the date on which the transaction was confirmed and a chart that connects that transaction ID or wallet address to past and future blockchain movements using cluster detection and address identification.  The following example shows the Scorechain analysis for one transaction where funds had previously moved through the online black market Agora.  Gerard said there are some limitations to the service, as it currently relies on public information from sources such as Reddit and Pastebin to link bitcoin addresses to specific entities.  The CEO said Scorechain may work to obtain information from other companies in the industry, like bitcoin exchanges, but suggested it still needs to determine how such potentially sensitive customer information would need to be managed.

42426565,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZXh,1444658019,Polish Finance Ministry: EU Should Create Bitcoin Regulation,"Poland’s Ministry of Finance has said regulating bitcoin should form ""part of initiatives at the EU level, due to the transborder character of cryptocurrency transactions"".  The ministry provided this statement in a written response to a request for information filed by two Polish Members of Parliament (MPs), Jan Warzecha and Bogdan Rzońca.  In their request for information, the MPs said ""piracy, cybercrime, phishing, thefts and hacking online accounts and attacks on the users of cryptocurrencies are increasingly often taking place"".  More specifically, they said that, between 2004 and 2014, the amount of detected cybercrimes increased from 404 to some 22,000. As a result, the politicians asked the ministry whether it ""has plans to launch legislative activities with the aim of regulating the issue of digital currencies"".  No plans for bitcoin regulation  While stating it does not plan to initiate any new cryptocurrency-related regulations in the near future, the Polish Ministry of Finance said:  ""What is equally important, besides regulatory activities, is an informational campaign which highlights the risks resulting from purchasing cryptocurrency, and which is developed by the General Inspector of Financial Information.”  In spite of its call on the European Union institutions to regulate cryptocurrency, the document states ""the issue will continue to be of interest to the Ministry of Finance, including its tax administration authorities"".  In their request for information, the two MPs ask whether there is any proof that cryptocurrencies have been used in Poland to launder money or finance terrorist activities.  The ministry states that, to date, ""tax authorities have not reported … any irregularities related to violations of the tax legislation"".  It goes on to say the country’s General Inspector of Financial Information performs, on an ongoing basis, research activities ""in the field of monitoring and analysing potential risks of money laundering or financing terrorism with the use of cryptocurrencies"".  The document, which was written in Polish, is available on the Polish parliament’s website, and indicates it was obtained by the Polish parliament on 15th September, following a request for information filed by the two lawmakers on 26th August.  The two MPs are members of the parliamentary club of Law and Justice (PiS) party which currently is leading the polls ahead of the country's parliamentary elections, scheduled to take place on 25th October.  Should Poland have a new government following the vote, the Ministry of Finance could change its stance on cryptocurrency regulation.

42426562,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZTh,1444648533,Blockchain Platform Setl Exceeds 1 Billion Transaction 'Milestone',"UPDATE (12th October 14:17 BST): Comment added from Setl CEO Anthony Culligan.      Blockchain platform Setl claims it is now capable of processing 1 billion transactions per day, a figure it terms a ""milestone"" for scaling the technology.  The firm, which is building a private network of distributed ledgers that can settle cash and assets in real time, says its testnet can now match the volume of non-cash electronic payments made globally.  When announced in July, Setl's network was handling 5,000 transactions per second, which amounts to 432 million a day.  The company said in a release:  ""By exceeding 1 billion transactions per day, Setl is addressing one of the fundamental issues of legacy blockchains, which, unlike Setl, are not designed for financial markets and are unable to handle market volumes.""  While blockchain technology is gaining traction as a cheaper, leaner alternative to legacy financial systems – settlement, for example, currently costs firms $65–$80bn annually – bankers remain skeptical about the speed and reputation of open systems such as bitcoin.  According to the 2014 World Payments Report, the top 10 markets make 800 million payments each day, or 9,258 per second. By contrast, bitcoin's blockchain can process under 10 per second. The technology also presents anti money laundering and know your customer risks for these highly-regulated institutions due to its open, pseudonymous nature.  Full transparency  Setl, like other 'permissioned' ledgers, is looking to eliminate these risks for banks by requiring all its users to be certified following due diligence. Additionally, regulators will be able to view real-time transactions on Setl – which will function as a series of 'linked' blockchains – with ""full transparency"".  CEO Anthony Culligan told CoinDesk:  ""Bitcoin is taking a particular journey, which includes it promoting significant social implications. This should be looked at as different from technology projects such as Setl, which are seeking to apply techniques to existing financial infrastructure to significantly reduce costs, revolutionise liquidity management and increase capital efficiency.""  The company, which claims to be in discussions with 40 key financial institutions, was co-founded by Peter Randall, former CEO of Chi-X – now the largest equity trading venue in Europe.  Culligan said Randall had achieved his success by creating consensus amongst a group of participants who would otherwise be in strong competition, adding:  ""This is exactly what is needed to create an industry wide blockchain solution. Our mantra is to do to the post-trade world what Chi-X did to trading.""
