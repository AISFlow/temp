42399985,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJCM,1497044410,Google's Director of Engineering Won't Invest in Bitcoin,"When Google’s director of engineering, Ray Kurzweil, started accepting audience questions at the Exponential Finance conference earlier today, the first three asks were about blockchain.  The man who in large part built his reputation based on what are widely considered accurate predictions based on historical data, talked about the power he believes cryptocurrencies have to cross borders and maybe replace national currencies.  But, he expressed skepticism that bitcoin would be that replacement. Addressing an audience of 700 senior executives, technologists and more, at the Exponential Finance event hosted by Singularity University, which he co-founded, Kurzweil explained his doubts.  While he described ""assumptions"" about bitcoin’s ability to scale as ""quite accurate"" he said that people won’t be looking at algorithms to make their spending decisions.  Instead he argued that it was the historic stability of a currency that makes it valuable, stability he said has been lacking in bitcoin.  Kurzweil said:  ""Ultimately, people need to have confidence in their currency and bitcoin in particular has not really demonstrated that. It’s had a good year, but a very rocky life before that.""  In the past year bitcoin’s price has increased from about $580 to almost $3,000. In February, the cryptocurrency surpassed a three-year old record of $1,165, only to regularly experience drops in price in excess of $100 in an hour and hundreds of dollars in a day.  According to Kurzweil, who has developed a reputation as a ""futurist"" for his uncanny predictions, such inconsistency undermines the cryptocurrency’s value as a currency.  ""I wouldn’t put my money into it,"" he said.  National cyrptocurrencies  In spite of Kurzweil’s skepticism of bitcoin as a currency, he also expressed interest in the possibility that the blockchain technology that powers bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could eventually be adopted by national governments.  He called the ""theory"" behind blockchain ""sound"" but said that ""people don’t yet have confidence in it.""  While bitcoin’s ability to store value and facilitate transactions across borders has developed a loyal following among a relatively small group of people, Kurzweil said that wider adoption won’t rely on the power of its algorithm, but its historic reliability.  ""There’s no reason why currencies should be associated with particular national boundaries and governments,"" he said. ""However, currencies like the dollar have provided reasonable stability, bitcoin has not.""  However, even as Kurzweil expressed his doubts about cryptocurrency as it currently exists, he argued that the promise of ""greater transparency"" and control over the creation process behind cryptocurrency could eventually lead a re-imagining of the way countries mint their native currencies.  He concluded:  ""Providing greater transparency, and blockchain does provide that, could be something adopted by leading currencies like the existing national currencies.""

42399963,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJ0Y,1497024620,Russia Likely to Mandate Identity Checks for Bitcoin Purchases,"Russia’s deputy finance minister said this week that cryptocurrency purchasers in the country will be required to prove their identity under forthcoming regulations.  In a month and a half, the Russian Finance Ministry will finalize proposals for cryptocurrency regulation, according to the Russian state-owned news agency TASS.  The Ministry is proposing to regulate the transaction of cryptocurrencies using principles that apply to financial instruments such as derivatives. A key aspect of the regulations will be a mandate for identification of digital currency, said Alexei Moiseev, the Deputy Finance Minister.  ""If you want to buy any financial product, you need to show passport, fill out a contract, write that you are not an American taxpayer. The same should apply here,"" Moiseev added.  This position is in line with the sentiment from Elvira Nabiullina, the Governor of the Central Bank of Russia, who told CNBC in a recent interview that the country is more likely to regard the bitcoin as a digital financial asset instead of a virtual currency.  And the news follows word that the Bank of Russia, the country’s central bank, is moving ahead with new rules that would recognize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as digital goods, with relevant tax imposed.

42399969,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJ4U,1497022462,US State Department Forms New Blockchain Working Group,"The US State Department is looking to boost its research resources in support of a new working group focused on blockchain.  According to a post on its website, the department, which serves as the US government's chief diplomacy arm, wants to bring in an intern to support research efforts for its ""Blockchain@State"" working group. The initiative is being overseen by the Office of Global Partnerships.  Reporting to Thomas Debass, the director for innovation and the acting special representative for global partnerships, the intern will track developments in blockchain and prepare bi-weekly briefings to keep the initiative informed of new applications in the field.  In the posting, the State Department outlined an ambitious approach to blockchain, arguing that it needs to move quickly to explore the ways in which the tech might impact how it functions.  The Department wrote:  ""Blockchain is not just for bitcoin. And it's not just for the private sector. Nations and cities around the world are actively utilizing this technology to transform the work of government. This is happening now. And the Department of State cannot afford to wait to explore applications of this technology to the work of international development and diplomacy.""  Department of State is not the only department in government looking into blockchain technology.  Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services held a hackathon to focus on blockchain applications following a call for research papers. The Commerce Department hosted an event to discuss how the tech could be applied to digital copyright in December.

42399970,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJ2W,1497017153,Dubai Plans Digital Passports Using Blockchain Tech,"The Dubai government has partnered with UK startup ObjectTech to bring blockchain-based security to the emirate's airport.  ObjectTech said this week that it is working with the Dubai Immigration and Visas Department to develop digital passports that can potentially eliminate manual checks at Dubai International airport.  According to the startup, the system combines biometric verification and blockchain technology, and will use a “pre-approved and entirely digitized passport” to authorize passengers' entrance into the country. The system will further verify individuals through a three-dimensional scan via a short tunnel as they walk from the aircraft to claim their baggage.  Using blockchain technology, the startup said the digitized passport will incorporate a feature called 'self-sovereign identity' for privacy protection, which it claims allows passengers to control which parties can view their passport information.  Paul Ferris, co-founder and CEO of ObjectTech, said in a blog post that the aim is to make the border process quicker and safer for international travelers, and also give passengers full control of their digital data. A pilot program is anticipated to be ready by 2020, although a detailed project timeline remains unclear.  In the post, the initiative was framed as one part of the Dubai government’s commitment to stay 10 years ahead of the rest of the world in public services.  As part of that ambitious process, the Dubai government has concluded the second round of Dubai Future Accelerators program, with 28 innovative startups signing up to work on projects with the authority. The collaborations mainly cover public sectors such as healthcare, education and utilities.

42399983,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJDL,1497013208,"3,000% Gains in 2017: What's Next for Ether Prices?","Ether prices are on the move, and they're headed north.  The cryptocurrency, which powers the world's second-largest blockchain, ethereum, has seen its price rise more than 3,000% year-to-date and roughly 180% in the last month, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Yet, amid this rise, and increase in investor attention, many are wondering how the digital asset's price will perform going forward. That answer, though, may not be exactly clear.  When polled, crypto market analysts provided mixed opinions. Some asserted that ether could experience significant upside in the future, even going so far as to suggest its market capitalization (market cap) could surpass that of bitcoin, long the market's progenitor and leader.  Others, however, warned that ether's price may have become inflated as the broader cryptocurrency space has drawn robust inflows.  Key role of ICOs  One crucial factor affecting ether's price is the rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs) – sales of blockchain-linked data that allow investors to exchange ether for newly created digital tokens.  Some of these offerings have generated significant visibility by selling millions of dollars-worth of tokens in minutes. As a result, ether's value is ""hugely related"" to these offerings, according to Brad Chun, chief investment officer of hedge fund Shuttle Fund Advisor.  Chun told CoinDesk he believes some companies are simply holding the ether tokens raised through these sales, since retaining the digital assets is more profitable than spending them on projects.  By holding ether tokens instead of spending them, these firms could be placing upward pressure on the cryptocurrency's price, he speculated.  Marius Rupsys, cryptocurrency trader and co-founder of fintech startup InvoicePool, offered similar sentiment. He stated that while most ICOs let investors use bitcoin or ether to purchase digital tokens, some choose ether, a) because they are afraid of missing out and b) its transactions take place more quickly.  ""This keeps many ethers locked up in new projects and [fewer] ethers are available for trading,"" he explained.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, also emphasized how these offerings are affecting ether's price. ""The value of ether is directly related to the value of [ICOs] listed on the [ethereum] protocol,"" he told CoinDesk.  Hayes stated that if more highly successful ICOs list on this platform, ether's price could experience significant gains.  ""If we get more instant sell outs like [Brave's BAT token], the ether price is a bargain at the moment,"" he continued.  What the bulls say  Hayes was certainly not the only one to offer a bullish forecast for ether, as some analysts have predicted that the alternative asset protocol will surpass bitcoin, a milestone event they inferred might take place in 2017.  At the time of report, ether's market cap was roughly $24bn, more than half that of bitcoin's $45.8bn, CoinMarketCap figures reveal. Bitcoin's share of the total market cap for all cryptocurrencies has been declining lately, standing at roughly 45% at press time. (This is after hovering above 80% during most of the time for which market data is available.)  While bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to scale, and has long been the largest in terms of market cap, it could lose this position soon enough, said Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management.  ""I think ether will overtake bitcoin, probably before the end of the year,"" he stated.  Enneking is not alone in this belief, as Sebastian Limeres, a cryptocurrency advocate and Argentine attorney, also predicted that ether's market cap will surpass that of bitcoin either this year or next.  He said:  ""Ether is the next big thing for being a platform, same as Oracle is to software.""  Bubble concerns  While some market observers are clearly bullish about ether's future prospects, not everyone is so optimistic. Some analysts have warned that ether's price may have grown overvalued.  Their concern is understandable, as the price of many cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed in recent months and ether could simply be one more alternative asset protocol that has surged as a result. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies surpassed $100bn for the first time ever this month, which represented an increase of more than 100% in less than 30 days, CoinMarketCap figures show.  ""We're fresh off a speculative bubble across crypto assets, so true valuations won't make much sense right now,"" Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk. He added: ""I think ether is leading the pack in this crypto-inflated bubble.""  Zivkovski further asserted that investors are making speculative bets on ether.  ""Many investors are betting on ethereum for its future potential, not its current network effects. They see bitcoin as a slow and inflexible cryptocurrency, while ether is adaptable, able to host and run decentralized systems and organizations, and has the backing of a team and corporations with a vision.""  Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, told CoinDesk that ether's value may be a bit too high.  ""I agree that ether seems inflated,"" he said. ""As a newcomer I'd be very wary of buying in at these prices, but for long-term holders, [it is] safer to ignore the rollercoaster and just hold tight.""  The middle line  While many analysts took sides as to whether ether's price is inflated, Rupsys took a more neutral stance, asserting that it is very difficult to answer whether the cryptocurrency is overvalued.  He commented on the supply side, emphasizing that very few ether tokens are available for sale. On the demand side, several factors might provide tailwinds for the cryptocurrency, noted Rupsys. Chinese exchanges have been adding ether-based trading pairs, which could bolster demand for the alternative asset protocol.  He emphasized that in some cases, ether's trading volume has surpassed that of bitcoin's on CoinMarketCap. Ether's 24-hour trading volume reached roughly $1.69bn at roughly 04:30 UTC on 31st May, surpassing bitcoin's $1.55bn.  Since ether does not trade on all exchanges, he said, ""This volume is very large and might increase.""  ""I see very few signs of correction for ethereum as of yet (it moves up, consolidates, then up again),"" Rupsys told CoinDesk. ""[But] I do keep an open mind and look for weakness signs in ether every day.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of DCG, which has an ownership stake in Brave.

42399975,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJ7R,1497009612,Bitcoin Experts to Congress: Overseas Exchanges Are Enabling Cybercrime,"Bitcoin and blockchain experts are urging US lawmakers to ramp up pressure on unlicensed offshore exchanges.  Coming yesterday during a hearing held by a subcommittee within the US House of Representatives, the calls followed a notable string of ransomware attacks that have seen consumer data held hostage in exchange for bitcoin payments. The situation has also seen politicians taking a renewed interest in the more negative aspects of cryptocurrency technology in response.  Yet, the core problem, panelists told the committee members, is not in bitcoin purchases, it's that when criminals do use bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes, they often go through exchanges hosted outside the US.  In statements, panelists sought to portray these businesses as unlicensed, unregulated and unwilling to abide by basic anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations, rules that digital currency exchanges in the US and Western Europe must abide by.  ""Nearly 100% of ransomware campaigns cash out through platforms such as these. It's a huge problem,"" said Kathryn Haun, a former Assistant US Attorney and now a lecturer at Stanford University. ""Not surprisingly, the bad actors are not using the Coinbases of the world.""  Elsewhere, the hearing examined the use of cryptocurrencies to finance criminal activities such as terrorism, money laundering and cybercrime, all of which fall under the House Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee's mandate to explore the national security implications of new financial innovations.  Perhaps unsurprisingly against this backdrop, committee members expressed concern that nefarious activity is becoming more common, while remaining largely outside the reach of authorities.  ""The reality is criminals today use cash, money service businesses and other means for illicit purposes, but we've provided law enforcement the regulatory tools to catch the bad guys,"" said Representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, the top Democrat on the committee.  He told attendees:  ""The question is: Does law enforcement have the tools to catch criminals using these new technologies and currencies?""  Looking offshore  Tracking down criminals and funds through unregulated overseas exchanges, however, is a difficult proposition for US law enforcement, as even the pettiest of criminals can find ways to obscure their identity.  Complicating matters, these businesses can frequently obtain implicit or explicit political protection from US authorities in certain jurisdictions, panelists said.  ""Criminals can open anonymous accounts, or accounts with phony names to fly under the radar of law enforcement,"" Haun said. ""Thus, we have received 'Mickey Mouse' who resides at '123 Main Street' in subpoena returns.""  If Congress and regulators are serious about tackling the national security implications of digital currencies, taking on these kinds of exchanges is a good place to start, emphasized Scott Dueweke, president of The Identity and Payments Association.  Dueweke said:  ""We must find a way to target these criminal currency exchanges, often sheltered in countries where officials protect and even profit from them.""  Defining the problem  While bitcoin has had its share of nefarious uses, the panelists emphasized that this dynamic is hardly a historical anomaly in technology.  ""Early misuse is a fact of life with many emerging technologies, and cryptocurrency is no exception,"" said Stanford's Haun, who is also a member of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's board of directors. ""We often say that any technology worth adopting is adopted first by bad actors.""  Further, the nature and frequency of the illicit activity actually being financed by digital currencies differs from the current general perception.  Jerry Brito, executive director of non-profit advocacy group Coin Center, cited a recent report from the Center for a New American Security, which concluded that only anecdotal evidence exists to support the suggestion that terrorist groups are financing operations through the use of digital currencies.  Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Chainalysis, seconded that point, adding that only one verifiable public case of crowdfunding by a known terrorist organization has occurred, and that this campaign raised a meager $1,000.  While it is certainly plausible that such activity could become more common, Brito said, there is little reason to justify a crackdown that might quash the technology's advancement:  ""This means there is time to develop an appropriate response to the possibility; a reasoned response that targets the threat while preserving the freedom to innovate.""  Haun added that the more immediate misuse is occurring in the areas of cybercrime, money laundering and financial fraud. ""These activities have major national security implications,"" she said.  Built-in solution  Still, while digital currencies do offer criminals a fresh way of financing themselves and procuring services, they also provide authorities with powerful new analytical and tracking tools for following the movement of funds.  As such, participants in the panel portrayed bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology as a potential solution to issues caused by bitcoin, the technology that invented and popularized this unique union of digital innovations.  ""Bitcoin is thought to be anonymous by some criminals, in reality it's far from anonymous, and companies like Elliptic have assisted law enforcement and private industry to identify who is behind illicit bitcoin transactions,” said Luke Wilson, vice president of business development at the startup.  Haun went so far as to recall her experience using transactions on a blockchain ledger to investigate and prosecute a rogue federal agent who had been working with Silk Road, an online dark market shut down by authorities in 2013.  She said:  ""This was just one early example. We have since uncovered – and solved – many hacking and major ransomware schemes by looking at the movement of bitcoin.""

42399986,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJFJ,1497006017,ICO Investments Pass VC Funding in Blockchain Market First,"This article highlights findings from CoinDesk Research's new Q1 2017 State of Blockchain report, expanding on ICO and VC investment in Q2.    Click here to download the slides as a PDF.    For the first time in the technology's short history, blockchain entrepreneurs are now raising more money through initial coin offerings (ICOs) than traditional venture capital investments.  So far in 2017, blockchain entrepreneurs have raised $327m through ICO offerings, a figure that now exceeds the $295m raised through VC funding, according to CoinDesk data.  Analysis shows the development was spurred by big gains in Q2, as entrepreneurs raised $291m through ICOs, compared to just $187m in traditional funding over the same period.  Overall, the totals are a far cry from 2016, when the nascent funding mechanism accounted for less than half of the nearly $500m of venture capital invested into startups. In the first quarter of 2017, for example, ICOs raised to just under a third of entities seeking VC funding.  In the months since, however, this trend has reversed with ICO investment totals growing over 800% and soaring past venture capital funding.  The second quarter has seen less than 10 venture capital deals thus far.  More than 80% of that funding was contributed by two deals: bitcoin mining chip maker Canaan ($43.6m) and distributed ledger consortium R3 ($107m).  By comparison, more than 20 ICOs have closed thus far in the second quarter, with over 10 exceeding $10m (and numerous selling out in just seconds or with massive valuations.)  ICO investment into early-stage blockchain projects has now totaled more than venture capital, the primary funding source for the industry in every year prior.  Making sense of the data and its impact, though, might be more challenging.  While they’re often compared, it may not be the case that sales of blockchain-based tokens – which in a sense monetize a startups network effort (and distribute ownership and influence to the widest audience possible) – will replace traditional venture capital, designed to enable investors to buy a share of a company's equity (with no real downside to a limited group of holders).  Already emerging are a number of startups (Brave, Civic, Kik) that have both traditional VC investment and have issued a form of token, though its not clear that this hybrid model will prove ultimately impactful.  Whether it be by token sales and projects supported largely by the retail public from the start, institutional investors who begin to dominate ICO rounds or some hybrid structure, the space is wide open for innovation and evolution.  Further, the proliferation of new decentralization application platforms and independent blockchains has added additional difficulty to surveying the universe of tokens, as investors must not only analyze the application or system (like augur or golem), but also the base protocol or infrastructure layer (like ethereum, waves or lisk) in numerous cases.  Still, with proven demand and interest from both entrepreneurial and investor audiences and limited regulatory guidance, ICOs could continue to gain steam as a fundraising mechanism.  How the structures, valuations and legalities evolve is a much larger question, but undoubtedly the continued and growing wave of token sales will focus the spotlight on each of these questions and more.

According to the US Attorney’s Office in the District of Maryland, the two individuals, James Stewart and Vincent Grant, were indicted for using bitcoins to purchase stolen credit and debit card numbers of individuals and businesses from foreign websites. The two were first prosecuted last year, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  The defendants were accused of using magnetic strip re-encoding tools to apply stolen numbers to dummy cards, after which they would buy merchandise from Army and Air Force Exchange Service stores at US military bases, as well as other locations in Maryland and elsewhere.  The federal jury found Stewart guilty on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Grant was also convicted for conspiracy to commit access device fraud and aggravated identity theft.  A total of five Army National Guard members were arrested and charged.  Of the other three in the case, Derrick Shelton and Quentin Stewart previously pleaded guilty for committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, while Jamal Moody pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit access device fraud and aggravated identity theft.  Shelton and James and Quentin Stewart face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while Grant and Moody are subject to a maximum seven-and-half year sentence. A mandatory minimum of two years in prison for aggravated identity theft, on top of any other sentence, also apply to all five involved.

42399979,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJBN,1496998810,Swedish Government Utility Trials Blockchain Energy Transfers,"Business Area Markets, the energy trading branch of Vattenfall, a leading Swedish power company wholly owned by the government, is testing potential applications of blockchain.  Announced this week, the firm has joined forces with 22 other European energy trading firms in an effort to build a peer-to-peer trading system in the wholesale energy market using the technology.  The trial, according to statements from Vattenfall, is being hosted by Ponton, a company based in Hamburg whose encrypted software allows trading organizations to anonymously send orders to a decentralized order book.  The proof-of-concept will run until the end of 2017, and if successful, participants intend to start live trading on the platform.  Vattenfall and other trading firms expect to be able to buy and sell energy without going through a centralized energy marketplace, thereby saving money. Today, BA Markets trades either via energy exchanges or directly with counterparts through brokers and broker platforms.  ""On average, we enter into 1,400 deals per day across all energy commodities and markets,"" said Kilian Leykam, trading business development manager at BA Markets, adding:  ""Each deal causes transaction costs and has to be processed in our systems.""  By switching to a peer-to-peer system, the firm expects to operate more efficiently at lower transaction costs, which would enable the trading of small-scale production and consumption that involves, for example, private homes with solar panels.  Still, Vattenfall is not the only energy giant experimenting with blockchain technology use cases.  Earlier this month, a group of energy firms including BP and Austrian utility giant Wien Energie announced that they completed a blockchain energy trading trial.
