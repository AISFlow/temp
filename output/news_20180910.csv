42381164,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94GKx,1536613221,"Crypto Use A 'Fringe Activity' Among Terrorists, Says Think Tank","A new report from a Washington, D.C. think tank presented last week argued that cryptocurrencies aren't well-suited for terrorist financing – while also highlighting the limited success terrorist groups have had attempting to raise funds with the technology.  The paper was produced by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance and presented during a hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives Services Committee's hearing on terrorism financing. Authored by Yaya Fanusie, director of the center, the full text has since been published on the Committee's website.  Noting that ""cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are not innately illicit and should not be feared,"" the report provides an overview of several cases in which groups used cryptocurrency to raise funds.  These include pro-Islamic State websites, a group based in Gaza, a group allegedly connected with Al-Qaeda, and a contractor training ISIS fighters. It also cites the case of Ali Shukri Amin, who pleaded guilty in 2015 after he penned a blog post explaining how ISIS could raise money using bitcoin.  Still, the technology isn't well suited for those who are raising funds in war-torn areas, writing at one point that ""operating financially with digital currencies remains a fringe activity both among the general public and within the population of global jihadists.""  ""The good news is that most terrorists, particularly those operating on jihadist battlefields, inhabit environments that are not currently conducive to cryptocurrency use,"" the FDD notes elsewhere in the report. That said, according to the report, barriers including the public nature of crypto-transactions ""may fall away"" over time.  Specific cases cited  The FDD also cites reports from 2017 of a fundraising campaign led by a consortium of jihadists in the Gaza Strip called the Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC), which was deemed a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department.  The fundraising campaign, named Jahezona (Arabic for ""Equip Us""), aimed to raise $2,500 per fighter but ultimately raised ""a little over $500 in bitcoin"" based on information gleaned from public blockchain data.  Notably, the FDD contended that deposits were made via the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e.  Another group that tried to attract bitcoin donations called itself al-Sadaqa (Arabic for ""the Charitable Giving"") and claimed to be raising funds for fighters in Syria. According to the report, the group was connected to Al-Qaeda and promoted its propagandist content. As a result, al-Sadaqa was able to gather about $685 worth of Bitcoin, the researchers found.  The account of another organization, called Malhama Tactical and founded by an Uzbek who served in the Russian military before leaving to join rebels in Syria in 2013, had gathered less than $100 worth of bitcoin as the researchers monitored it.  Another element that would serve to curtail the success of such campaigns: the ability of U.S. regulators to watch those transactions in real time, as they have become ""proficient in analyzing cryptocurrency transactions,"" the report suggests.  ""While cryptocurrencies are not expected to displace conventional means of terror financing anytime soon, terrorists will likely use them if they grow more accepted for real-world goods and services,"" the FFD's report notes, adding:  ""Therefore, all agencies with counter-threat financing groups should have dedicated analysts who specialize in blockchain analysis.""

42381167,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94GOj,1536606334,Report: Nearly Half of ICOs Failed to Raise Funds Since Start of 2017,"Nearly half of all initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2017 and 2018 failed to raise any funds, while another 40 percent raised more than $1 million each, a new research report claims.  Research and consulting firm GreySpark Partners studied the ICO market across the past several years, finding that as many as 890 token sales did not raise any funds at all. By contrast, according to the report (embedded below), 743 token sales were able to reach the $1 million mark.  GreySpark also noted that many token projects fail to provide a positive return-on-investment, particularly as time passes. The report utilized data from ICOData.io and ICO-Check.com through August 2018.  There has been trepidation over the future of ICOs, with various developers saying that regulations, better-informed investors and even just market saturation may be responsible for a declining number of token sales.  The document offers some more technical reasons, saying the decline may be caused by ""lack of traction, disappointing product advancements, scams, difficulties in execution, no market and poor marketing or go-to-market strategy.""  However, there is one market that seems to be prospering: crypto-hedge funds.  According to the report, as of September, the number of hedge funds focused specifically on cryptocurrency projects and tokens has increased significantly to a total of 146 firms, despite an initial drop in January of 2018. This is up from nine crypto-focused hedge funds in 2012.  Contrary to traditional hedge funds, crypto-hedge funds consist of mostly long positions that involve higher risks, according to the report.  The analysis predicts that the number of crypto-hedge funds will grow to between 160 and 180 by the end of this year.    gry_Charting-the-growth-of-... by on Scribd    Gumball machine image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH | TOKEN SALE,Aditi Hudli,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/09/10/report-nearly-half-of-icos-failed-to-raise-funds-since-start-of-2017,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43b95e9dd8daab750813b78a5de1b09f269da5a2-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Calling the new token a ""significant advancement in digital assets,"" Cascarilla said:  ""In the current marketplace, the biggest hindrances to digital asset adoption is trust and volatility. As a regulated trust with a 1:1 dollar-collateralized stablecoin, we believe we are offering an asset that improves on the utility of money.""  Built based on ethereum's ERC-20 standard, the stablecoin can be sent between any two wallets on the ethereum network, although the release noted that only verified Paxos customers can purchase or redeem tokens on the company's website. To maintain the stablecoin's value, tokens are destroyed when they are redeemed, while tokens still in circulation will be backed by dollars held in in the firm's custody.  As part of its services, any investors who trade using Paxos' itBit exchange or over-the-counter trading desk can immediately cash their cryptocurrency holdings out using Paxos Standard.

Speaking at a press conference after a meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council last Friday, Valdis Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission, said member states are supportive of moves to chart regulations governing the cryptocurrency industry in the economic region.  Dombrovskis said:  ""We also had a good exchange of views on crypto-assets. We see that crypto-assets are here to stay. Despite the recent turbulence, this market continues to grow.""  Further, he suggested that initial coin offerings (ICOs) have the potential to become a viable form of alternative financing. ""Already last year, ICOs helped raise over $6 billion in funding and this year this figure will be substantially bigger,"" he said.  To make the most of this potential, Dombrovskis said the challenge right now is how to ""categorize and classify"" crypto assets and whether the EU should use existing financial market rules or create a set of dedicated regulations for cryptocurrencies.  ""In this context, we are currently working together with European Supervisory Authorities on what we call regulatory mapping of crypto assets to answer exactly these questions,"" he said. ""This will provide a solid ground to build on and to decide on further steps in this area.""  Dombrovskis has previously made positive remarks on ICOs as an innovative fundraising method, as reported by CoinDesk in February. He indicated at the time that regulators would take more of a case-by-case approach to govern specific token projects, although he conceded more work would need to be done by the commission.  And he isn't the lone ICO-friendly lawmaker in the EU. Last Friday, a Member of the European Parliament suggested a new rule governing ICOs that would place an upper cap on token sale proceeds, but would also make eligible projects accessible across EU member states.

42381187,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Gir,1536577210,Bitcoin Retains Bear Bias Despite Recovery From 25-Day Low,"Bitcoin's (BTC) recovery from 25-day lows seen over the weekend has done little to alleviate the near-term bearish bias, technical studies indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,119 on Bitfinex on Saturday – the lowest level since Aug. 14 – bolstering the bearish setup established by a sudden $1,000 drop witnessed during a 24-hour period in the middle of the last week.  However, the drop to 3.5-week lows also pushed the intraday relative strength index (RSI) into oversold territory below 30.00. As a result, the sell-off has stalled in the last 36 hours, although corrective rallies have been shallow.  Notably, the cryptocurrency's failure to scale $6,400 in a convincing manner despite signs of bullish reversal on intraday charts indicates that bearish sentiment is still quite strong.  Hence, the next big move is more likely to be on the downside. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,290, representing a 0.6 percent rise in a 24-hour basis.  Daily candlestick chart        The rising wedge breakdown and the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs), as seen in the chart above, indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside. The RSI of 39.14 is also biased toward the bears.  Daily line chart  As can be seen, BTC suffered a pennant breakdown on the daily line chart on Saturday, signaling a revival of the long-term bear market. Hence, prices could re-test the June lows below $5,800 in the next few days.  4-hour chart  The bullish divergence of the RSI has set the stage for a stronger corrective rally, however, it is likely to happen only above the trendline hurdle, currently located at $6,420.  View  BTC risks falling to $6,000 (February low) and could suffer deeper losses in the near-term.  A stronger corrective rally toward 10-day MA of $6,746 cannot be ruled out if the cryptocurrency convincingly scales the immediate hurdle at $6,420, but the gains will likely be short-lived as the short-term MAs are trending south.

42381176,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94GV1,1536577097,"Interstellar Arrives: Visa, Citi-Backed Chain Acquired By Stellar Startup","A long-rumored acquisition that finds two of the crypto industry's leading entrepreneurs teaming to back the world's sixth-largest blockchain has been confirmed.  Announced Monday, Chain, which raised more than $40 million from financial institutions including Visa and Nasdaq, in the process helping define the narrative for business interest in the technology through its partnerships and stage appearances, has been acquired in an undisclosed deal by Lightyear.io, a startup building on the Stellar protocol.  Closed officially September 5, the deal will find both brands combining to form a new entity called Interstellar to be helmed by former RRE Ventures partner and Chain CEO Adam Ludwin, who will serve as Interstellar's CEO, and Jed McCaleb, the creator of the XRP and Stellar protocols, who will be acting CTO.  The combined company will retain ""100 percent"" of Chain's employees, according to Ludwin, including co-founder Devon Gundry, who will remain on as chief product officer. All told, about 60 employees are now employed by Interstellar, Ludwin said.  While terms of the deal were not disclosed, Ludwin affirmed in interview that shareholders were bought out and that it was ""a good deal for investors."" Early estimates had pegged the deal as valued at nearly $200 million, which if true, would make it one of the year's largest.  However, while interest will likely remain high on the deal's lingering details, Ludwin and McCaleb were keen in interviews and statements to place their emphasis on the future.  In fact, Ludwin went so far as to suggest that the acquisition by Lightyear shouldn't be viewed as a change in direction, even though Chain's work focused largely on private blockchains.  Ludwin told CoinDesk:  ""If you look at our work with Visa, Citi, in every case, we made huge progress, but we would also find ourselves at an impasse when it was the partners who had to instantiate a blockchain. We needed a chain that anyone could access.""  In Ludwin's words, Chain got ""Stellar envy,"" when it realized the open-source project was succeeding on its goal of creating a platform that could excel at asset issuance, albeit largely with startups.  At the time, McCaleb, Ludwin said, encountered a reciprocal problem. Created in 2014 and managed by the non-profit Stellar Development Foundation, the protocol's coders were looking for a link to institutions that could help them commercialize their work.  That said, also notable is that Ludwin said Interstellar does not intend to play an active role in the market for the Stellar cryptocurrency, XLM, saying that Interstellar is a ""software"" play.  ""It's about the platform layer to make the network as powerful and useful as possible for those organizations that want to leverage stellar,"" he continued.  A long courtship  Still, for those involved, today's represents the conclusion of a process that began as far back as early 2018, when McCaleb first approached Ludwin for a meeting.  Ludwin said that while the two have been acquainted since 2014, they ""didn't know each other super well"" prior to discussing how they might solve mutual problems.  In this way, Ludwin said that early meetings were mostly about establishing relations.  ""I have a certain public reputation, he has a certain public reputation. As usual, what you think about someone based on their public persona and who they actually are are drastically different, and we decided that after four to five weeks, let's do this together,"" Ludwin said.  At the time, details about a potential sale began to emerge, with CoinDesk first learning that Chain was in discussions to be acquired by a company affiliated with Stellar in May (though details remained unclear as to the mechanics and entities involved in the deal).  Ludwin confirmed that the two companies examined multiple ways to structure the deal, which added to the length of the acquisition talks, as did efforts to retain existing employees. He declined to indicate if the liquidation of any cryptocurrencies was used to facilitate the acquisition.  Not another Ripple  Elsewhere, Ludwin sought to distance Interstellar from comparisons to one McCaleb's early efforts, San Francisco-based Ripple, a company for which McCaleb served as founder and CTO before the relationship devolved into high-profile legal battles.  For one, Ludwin said that Interstellar would seek to work with the Stellar Development Foundation to grow the software in concert with other for-profit startups.  ""Ripple is focused on international B2B networks, being crypto Swift for banks. Stellar has increasingly become the platform of choice for issuing tokens of all kinds,"" he said.  Still, like Ripple, Ludwin said the new company will continue to work to bring open-source software to the firms with which Chain already had established projects.  Interstellar, he said, will continue to use its cloud blockchain service Sequence, introduced last October, and will also make use of the tech behind its Chain Protocol, a suite of tools designed to enable private blockchain networks, launched in 2016.  As such, he said the products will be used alongside software from Stellar's non-profit arm, enabling the company to work with both private and public networks.  ""What you're going to see from Interstellar is a convergence of the two. Where it makes sense to have assets in a private environment, we'll use Chain's products, when it makes sense for these assets to be transferred over a network, we'll use stellar,"" he said, adding:  ""You don't think I'm on a public network or I'm on a private network, I'm on my computer, doing work.""  Third time's a charm  In interview, Ludwin also addressed his journey as an entrepreneur working closely with blockchain and cryptocurrencies, noting that in many ways this could be viewed as a kind of third version of a vision he began pursuing in 2014.  At launch, Chain was focused on providing products for bitcoin developers, emerging as a well-financed competitor to early Silicon Valley startups such as Gem and Coinbase, then both pursuing a model in which they sought to court coders.  Chain would later raise $30 million from major financial institutions in 2015 in a repositioning that found the company seeking to become the preferred partner for businesses that wanted to leverage blockchain to leverage the technology to create new products.  Still, Ludwin said the goal at all times as been the pursuit of technology that would enable a platform for the creation of new assets, ones that, like bitcoins on the bitcoin blockchain, would be defined by cryptography and peer-to-peer networking.  To that end, Ludwin suggested he's merely been more aggressive in pursuit of this vision, willing to ride the twists and turns of one of the tech industry's fastest-moving sectors.  Ludwin concluded:  ""Have we experimented with approaches? Heck yeah, but if you're in this industry and you haven't, you're not likely to get it right on the first stab.""

The official sales channel of bitcoin mining giant Bitmain, which has the WeChat ID ""antminersale,"" appears to be blocked on Monday. As of press time, searching for content previously distributed by the account leads to a page that says it has violated relevant rules.  The notice states:  ""Following users' complaints, the platform [WeChat] has reviewed and discovered that this account – without having acquired authorized credentials or licenses – has been publishing and distributing information of relevant businesses it is involved in.""  A company representative has not responded to a CoinDesk request for details on what could have led to the move to censor the channel.  However, another Bitmain official account that provides product information for mining equipment – ""antminer_official"" – still remains active as of press time.  In recent days, WeChat – owned by internet giant Tencent and now the most popular messaging tool in China – has also moved to block accounts that are involved in offering content related to cryptocurrency market prediction and analysis.  For instance, over the weekend, one user who operates an official account called ""Goldcoins"" that had been publishing crypto market analysis for the past nine months confirmed on Zhihu, China's equivalent to Quora, that the feed has been shut down on WeChat.  Further, the official account of a blockchain project called Delphy – an ethereum-based application similar to the Augur prediction protocol – also became unavailable on Monday.  In both cases, the reason provided by WeChat for the censorship is the same as stated on Bitmain's sales channel.  The move comes soon after Tencent recently targeted several major cryptocurrency media sources in China, some of which were allegedly involved in distributing information for initial coin offerings on WeChat.  So far, more than 30 official accounts relating to blockchain and cryptocurrency have been blocked by the messaging giant, according to account information verified by CoinDesk.

42381153,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Dxl,1536566441,Argentina Back in Crisis: Should the Government Buy Bitcoin?,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      When people ask me what got me into bitcoin, I often answer with one word: ""Argentina. ""  Amid the sad news that the South American country is again gripped by a currency crisis, I'm getting a strong reminder of that connection.  Below, I explain it and explore one crypto team's proposal for the Argentine government to overcome this latest meltdown with a stability-seeking strategy that partly includes bitcoin.  Over the past 30 years, Argentina has tried a diverse toolkit of mainstream economic solutions to its persistent drift into chaos, and each has failed. Perhaps a new, outside-the-box, crypto-friendly approach is needed. And with other emerging-market countries now suffering ""contagion"" from Argentina's, Turkey's and other developing countries' woes, maybe there's a lesson for the wider world too.  Love-hate  My Argentina-bitcoin connection stems from six years spent in Buenos Aires during the previous decade. While my family and I adored living there, we had a tortured, love-hate relationship with the country.  On the plus side, in addition to its great food, wine and culture, we made some of the best, most loving, loyal friends we've ever made in our adult lives in Argentina.  On the negative side: broken civil institutions and a history of corrupt governments ensured that a dysfunctional economy would repeatedly, almost inevitably, drift toward monetary crises. This stoked inflation and bred uncertainty, making it increasingly difficult to make economic plans.  Eventually, the latter problem forced us to leave. We wanted our kids to grow up in a society that offered greater long-term opportunities. Even after we'd made the decision to go, Argentina's dysfunction almost destroyed us financially, when we struggled to get our life savings out of the country -- as readers of Paul Vigna's and my first book, The Age of Cryptocurrency, will know.  What does all this have to do with bitcoin? Well, it starts with the core social problem of trust, which, in essence, cryptocurrencies and blockchains strive to resolve with their unique, decentralized approach to recordkeeping and value exchange.  Both the positives and the negatives of our Argentine experience stem from this trust challenge. In Argentina, as with other societies with notoriously corrupt or failed institutions, strong personal bonds of trust are forged among family and friends because they provide a social safety net to help you secure your property and well-being against a wider system that can't be trusted to protect them.  What's lacking is a lasting social covenant between citizens and institutions of government, the kind that, in more functional economies, breeds the former's trust in the latter. (Be warned, Americans, that covenant is not guaranteed forever. It can be destroyed.) It becomes entirely expected that government officials will rob the public purse. As a result, tax avoidance and graft are normalized and entrenched.  The crisis cycle  The ultimate measure of whether a society enjoys such a covenant is the stability of its fiat currency, whose value will evaporate if users don't trust the government not to debase it in pursuit of its own interests. This is the core story of Argentina, whose habit of succumbing to a crisis every ten or so years has over time taken this resource-rich country from being one of the world's wealthiest at the start of the 20th century to a byword for economic dysfunction.  Note: this is not per se a commentary on the government of President Mauricio Macri, which has, in my mind, pursued some of the more sensible policies of any in recent decades and has avoided turning the peso's printing presses into a funding vehicle. The problem is that even the most well-intended, honest shooter of a president will struggle against this ingrained structure of mistrust and corruption.  So, with all of that as a relatively fresh experience, bitcoin came as a revelation when I finally grasped its central promise in 2013.  What if Argentines could outsource the record-keeping system underpinning their payments and value exchanges to a decentralized network that's controlled not by mistrusted human institutions but by a common, censorship-resistant, math-driven protocol?  What if the teeming poor who fill the ever-growing shantytowns on the outskirts of Buenos Aires had a more trustworthy system for recording and monetizing their assets and identities?  What if a digital currency that's easily available for electronic, cross-border transactions became these people's go-to means of storing wealth, rather than greenbacks stored in hidden safety deposit boxes that can't be easily moved offshore?  It turned out I wasn't alone in thinking this way. Early bitcoin thought leaders such as Wences Casares and Andreas Antonopoulos were already articulating how cryptocurrencies would appeal to people in places with failed economic systems.  Their predictions have steadily played out. Argentina has become a hotbed of crypto development. Venezuela's mining rigs are now legendary. And lately Turkey has seen a surge in demand for bitcoin.  A fix for government too?  But what if it wasn't just private citizens turning to this technology as a fix, but governments?  Enter Santiago Siri, a San Francisco-based blockchain technology enthusiast who's best known for his work developing the voting platform Democracy Earth. Siri's heading back to his native Argentina later this month with a proposal for Luis Caputo, the President of Argentina's Central Bank.  His idea, announced in a tweet (in Spanish) last month, is that the central bank place up to one percent of its national reserves in bitcoin. It's a modest idea, but with potentially significant ramifications.  Because of its focus on reserves, which developing countries use as a buffer to help stabilize their currencies, it might be tempting to compare this strategy to Argentina's past dollar-focused models, including the infamous ""convertibility plan"" of the 1990s. Under that model, the Argentine peso was rigidly pegged one-to-one to the dollar via a constitutional commitment to hold at least the equivalent value of its money supply in U.S. currency reserves.  This ""currency board"" arrangement worked well for a few years. However, its fatal flaw -- the misalignment of Argentina's and the United States' economic interests -- was exposed when the U.S. Federal Reserve began aggressively hiking interest rates at the worst possible time for Argentina's then-slowing economy.  The local currency became heavily overvalued relative to its economic health -- ultimately, unsustainably so. The peg broke, essentially bankrupting the country, and setting forth a pendulum swing that took the country from a heavily deflationary environment to the unsustainable inflationary situation of the present.  Siri's proposal has no such extreme pegging concepts behind it. It would simply add more diversity to the central bank's reserves. But by exposing some of the nation's official reserve holdings to a cryptocurrency that many of its people are increasingly holding, and shifting some of it away from U.S. policy-dependent dollars, there would, in effect, be a modest aligning of interests. Siri also suggests the government use some its large nuclear power capacity to engage in state-owned bitcoin mining to cheaply expand its reserves.  Pro-innovation signal  As modest as it, a nod toward bitcoin of this kind could be meaningful for the country, signaling support for financial innovation and for decentralized models that reinforce public confidence.  And while the downside of price volatility is limited by the one-percent cap, the upside financial boost could be significant if, as Siri expects, bitcoin rallies when foreign governments start abandoning dollars in the midst of a mounting global trade war.  Putting one percent of its reserves in bitcoin, Siri estimates, would leave the country holding a hefty 0.5 percent of the total float for the cryptocurrency, giving it ""first mover"" advantages.  The proposal raises as many challenging questions as it answers, including how ownership of the nation's private keys will be defined. (Siri has flagged the idea of the presidency and the central bank sharing a multi-sig wallet.) He is also proposing changes to Argentine law, including to custodianship rules and those dealing with the tax treatment of crypto.  A move of this kind would be a noteworthy departure from the fiat-centric orthodoxy of traditional economists. But for a country that has tried these experts' prescriptions from across the spectrum of economic beliefs, maybe it's time to look outside the mainstream.

42381156,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94E5J,1536560113,Australian State Pilot Puts Driver's Licenses on a Blockchain,"Australia's New South Wales (NSW) government is turning to blockchain for a state-wide test of its driver license digitization program scheduled for November.  In an announcement on Aug. 20, the NSW government said it will conduct the pilot for 140,000 license holders in the state prior to a formal roll-out in 2019. Secure Logic, an Australian IT firm and technological partner on the project, said on Monday its blockchain platform will underpin the initiative to secure data in a distributed fashion.  Called TrustGrid, the blockchain network has already been trialed in a preliminary pilot of the scheme conducted in the state's Dubbo city last year, as ZDNet reported on Monday.  The goal of the new program is to use a distributed network to authenticate and store driver license data, so that users can present their digital credentials via a mobile application. In this way, they will no longer need to carry physical licenses to prove their ages and identities when checked by police or entering pubs and clubs.  The initiative follows a bill passed in May that granted the legality of government projects that seek to let residents present license data digitally, for instance, via a blockchain network, the report said.  The scheme is in line with the country's overall goal of adopting blockchain and distributed ledger technology as part of its Digital Economy initiative, as CoinDesk reported last year.  Currently, an Australian federal agency focused on scientific research is also working with IBM to develop a national blockchain aimed to let businesses carry out transactions based on smart legal contracts.

42381160,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94E7p,1536552007,"BitTorrent Courted EOS, Filecoin Crypto Creators Prior to Tron Sale","A number of well-known crypto startups had their eyes on BitTorrent prior to its acquisition by Tron's Justin Sun.  CoinDesk has learned that in addition to Tron and Neo, blockchain governance-focused project Icon and Protocol Labs, the developers of Filecoin, also entered into talks with BitTorrent to explore a purchase.  People familiar with the negotiations say there were two more parties – both in the blockchain space – that were interested in the peer-to-peer file-sharing company. Sources have not indicated that any companies or persons that were not in the blockchain space showed interest.  Justin Sun, the creator of Tron, ultimately prevailed in acquiring BitTorrent, as Variety first reported in June.  BitTorrent's software in many ways paved the way for today's efforts toward a decentralized internet, but even still the company had historically struggled to create a profitable business. In late 2017, the company lost its founder and the inventor of its most important technologies, Bram Cohen, who went on to found Chia, with the hopes of developing a more eco-friendly crypto mining process.  According to internal documents obtained by CoinDesk, BitTorrent initiated acquisition negotiations when Tron's founder approached BitTorrent's main shareholder, venture capital firm DCM. Specifically, Justin Sun approached David Chao, a BitTorrent board member who controlled the majority of the company's stock, and proposed to purchase DCM's preferred stock in order to gain a controlling stake.  However, Chao pressed Sun to also purchase BitTorrent's common stock to ensure that common stockholders would not be left empty-handed.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the most significant rival to Sun in the deal was Neo Global Capital, the investment vehicle of NEO, a blockchain project that's been called ""China's ethereum."" Neo Global Capital had floated an offer that was $50 million higher than that of Sun's, but for various reasons, the deal did not move forward.  BitTorrent documents also claim that, in addition to Sun, there were six other parties in negotiations around the acquisition. Three parties made offers while three others walked away.  CoinDesk has learned that BitTorrent also approached Block.one, the creator of the EOS protocol, to see if it was interested in acquiring the company. As previously reported, Block.one raised $4 billion through a year-long initial coin offering (ICO).  When reached for comment, Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer told CoinDesk in an email: ""They approached us and solicited the organization, but we were not interested.""  The allure of BitTorrent  Tron has not yet publicly explained why it acquired BitTorrent, though observers have speculated that Sun saw its 100 million users per month as an asset worth having.  However, more information is known about why the other suitors were interested in the acquisition.  Neo Global Capital, for instance, told CoinDesk that it thought BitTorrent could develop a decentralized file storage protocol that could be useful for decentralized applications (dapps) within its blockchain ecosystem.  According to people familiar with the matter, Protocol Labs saw value in BitTorrent's user base, while sources with knowledge of Icon's negotiations said the project was intrigued by the potential to build BitTorrent's software into its blockchain.  Yet neither Protocol Labs nor Icon made BitTorrent an offer, an outcome that sources attributed to concerns regarding copyright infringement issues associated with the protocol, monetization and the actual integration of the technology, and the company's price tag.  Based on CoinDesk's investigation, it's not clear that the other parties involved in negotiations, with the exception of Tron and Neo Global Capital, could be characterized as serious buyers.  BitTorrent and DCM declined a request for comment from CoinDesk. Tron did not reply to a request for comment.  For Ben Lebeau, the crypto lead at Sandwich Video – one of the most sought-after content production companies in Silicon Valley – it's not difficult to understand why BitTorrent was so desirable.  As an important disruptor in content distribution online, BitTorrent's business model and ethos align with that of the cryptocurrency community.  ""Peer-to-peer networks have always pushed this idea that the power to share information should be in the hands of the individual,"" Lebeau wrote CoinDesk, adding:  ""I think you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who would doubt the impact that BitTorrent had on file sharing before decent content delivery networks and other centralized alternatives existed.""  He also acknowledged the view that acquiring the firm was a way for Tron to establish a presence in the U.S. – a theory other observers have put forth.  ""On the other hand, it's an exceptionally clever way to migrate more people into the decentralized ecosystem,"" Lebeau continued, before concluding:  ""If Tron can figure out a way to leverage this network, that could move us closer towards creating a true internet of value.""
