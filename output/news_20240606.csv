29042852,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611834,1717714807,Injective Market-Shaking News Drives INJ Price Up By 7% – Details,"Injective, a Layer 1 (L1) protocol, emerged as one of the standout performers in the crypto market on Thursday, with its native token INJ experiencing a substantial 7% surge within the past 24 hours. Accompanying this surge, the protocol’s market capitalization is inching closer to the significant milestone of $3 billion. The price movement coincides with notable announcements by the Injective protocol regarding its token and ecosystem. Injective Users To Burn 6 Million INJ One of the key announcements unveiled by the protocol is the release of a comprehensive paper on the Injective Token, INJ. The paper delves into the token’s core utilities and mechanisms that power a programmable token economy, specifically focusing on deflationary acceleration. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP At $0.75 In July Despite Year-Long Slump Additionally, Injective disclosed that INJ token burn auctions are “steadily increasing in size,” with 12,266 tokens being burned indefinitely on the announcement day. Injective users are set to burn a cumulative total of 6 million INJ by next week. This burning mechanism plays a key role in reducing the total supply of tokens in circulation, thereby increasing scarcity and potentially driving up the value of the remaining tokens. Ultimately, this benefits token holders by establishing a deflationary mechanism and controlling inflation within the protocol. Injera And USDi Launch Injective also revealed that the anticipated launch of the Injera protocol is scheduled for the end of June, marking the beginning of “a new era for Injective,” according to the protocol. As announced, in collaboration with DojoSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Injective, the community will build Injera and USDi, the Injective Synthetic Dollar aimed at powering the Web3 ecosystem. The objective is to create a decentralized synthetic dollar token fully backed by Injective’s finance infrastructure. The Injera money market is at the core of the Injera protocol and USDi, designed as a collaterized debt position (CDP) market. This market optimizes capital efficiency for the USDi synthetic dollar by enabling sensible leveraging of USDi to borrow “market-making assets.” USDi, the native synthetic dollar, will be governed by the Injera token (ERA). It is a stable synthetic USD generated through delta-neutral positions, ensuring stable yields ranging from 10% to 90% for USDi holders. For DojoSwap, this development ensures a continuous increase in TVL and trading volume, generating fee amounts for ecosystem participants. Bullish Sentiment Returns As these announcements were made, the INJ token successfully reclaimed the $28.68 price level, reigniting its bullish momentum after experiencing a price correction to the $20 mark in April. This correction occurred following the token’s remarkable achievement of reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $52 in March. Related Reading: VanEck Revises Ethereum Prediction To Put Price At $22,000, Here’s Why In the immediate term, the $29 level may act as a hurdle for the token, representing a significant resistance point that has persisted for the past two months. However, if the bullish momentum continues, the token could surpass this resistance and retest the $31 and $35 resistance levels on the INJ/USD daily chart. Ultimately, the ongoing advancements within the Injective ecosystem have generated anticipation regarding the token’s future trajectory. Market participants are keen to see whether these developments can fuel a sustained upward trend and potentially surpass the previously achieved record levels.

The surge was seemingly fueled by a crypto whale move that ignited the community’s positive sentiment towards the token. Some analysts believe GMX might be preparing for a breakout above the $60 mark. Related Reading: AVAX Primed To Break $100 Barrier As Bullish Signs Emerge Whales Send GMX To New Wallets In the early hours of Thursday, a whale withdrew over 85,000 GMX tokens from crypto exchange Binance. Per the reports, the whale sent the funds to a fresh wallet, boosting the price surge. The whale withdrew 84,515 GMX, worth around $3.77 million, in five transactions for an average price of $43.07. This move propelled the price from $40 to $44 in the following hours. Moreover, the price jump resulted in over half a million in unrealized profit for the crypto investor. Similarly, reports of another whale withdrawing GMX from Binance surfaced this morning. According to the post, 72,300 GMX tokens were sent to a wallet from Binance. The wallet now holds 82,768 GMX, worth $3.69 million. The token’s surge appears to have begun before the whale activity. GMX’s price jumped from the $36 price range to the $42 mark on Wednesday, which fueled the positive sentiment of the crypto community. In the past 24 hours, GMX rose 22.2%, trading above $44 now. The recent performance represents a 26% and 76.3% price increase in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Moreover, it has registered a surge in its market activity, registering a 121% daily trading volume increase in the last day. Crypto Analysts Bullish On GMX The token’s performance didn’t go unnoticed by crypto analysts. The market watchers expressed their bullish sentiment towards GMX and set a short-term target. According to Daan Crypto, GMX appears to be running back to “turbo mode.” The token is currently up 2x from its bottom registered in April of this year. Moreover, GMX is “trading back above the daily 200MA/EMA.” To the analyst, the $41 support zone will be a key level to hold going forward. He also considers the $60 price range a good target for the token’s bullish momentum. Crypto trader and analyst JJcycles also weighed in on GMX’s performance. The trader highlighted a bullish flag pattern on the token’s chart. Per the analyst, GMX is “nicely reversing into the beginning of the third wave.” JJcycles also pointed out the token successfully broke out of the $40 resistance level in the following hours. To the trader, it looks like GMX printed the bottom in April when it went as low as $22. Additionally, he called out those who capitulated within the bottom accumulation range, including Arthur Hayes. “Just like it is supposed to be, capitulators are in pain,” wrote the analyst. Related Reading: Fake Crypto Airdrop: Tether’s CEO Warns Of Ongoing Supply Chain Email Exploit As reported by NewsBTC, the BitMEX founder was the largest individual holder of GMX, with over 230,000 GMX tokens.

The NFT project promised a video game, but its website vanished shortly after it finished its fundraise.  The United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it has charged three in connection with a non-fungible (NFT) token rugpull from 2021 known as Evolved Apes.  Mohamed-Amin Atcha, Mohamed Rilaz Waleedh, and Daood Hassan are charged with wire fraud and money laundering, according to a release from the SDNY's office.  Evolved Apes was a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs, which promised a videogame that never materialized, as the anonymous developer Evil Ape vanished a week after launch, siphoning 798 ether ($3 million at today's price, $2.7 million at the current time) from the project's funds.  ""The defendants ran a scam to drive up the price of digital artwork through false promises about developing a videogame,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. ""They allegedly took investor funds, never developed the game, and pocketed the proceeds. Digital art may be new, but old rules still apply: making false promises for money is illegal.""  In crypto parlance this type of maneuver is known as a rug pull, a type of exit scam in which developers raise funds from investors through the sale of tokens or NFTs, then abruptly shut down the project and disappear with the money.  According to De.Fi's Rekt database, over $14.5 billion has been lost to rug pulls since 2011.

However, the same can’t be said for most short-term holders yet, given the levels at which they purchased their Bitcoin holdings. Only 0.03% Of Long-term Bitcoin Holder Supply In Loss In a recent market report, on-chain analytics platform Glassnode claimed that the total volume of long-term holder (LTH) supply held in loss is “negligible,” with only 4,900 BTC (0.03% of LTH) acquired above Bitcoin’s current price. These long-term holders in loss are said to have been those who bought the 2021 cycle top and have held since then. Related Reading: Analyst Says Get Ready As Dogecoin Enters ‘Expansion Stage’, Can DOGE Reach $12? Long-term holders currently account for over 85% of the Bitcoin supply in profit. Glassnode noted that this was to be expected, given that the LTH supply in loss during the euphoric phase of the bull market “tends towards zero.” Therefore, this LTH will keep accounting for most of the supply in profit as the bull run progresses. Tokens held for more than 155 days fall under this LTH supply, although most investors in this category are likely those who held with high conviction throughout the last bear market, even as Bitcoin dropped below $20,000. Back then, this LTH supply accounted for most of the unrealized losses. Short-Term Holder Supply Accounts For Most Unrealized Loss Glassnode revealed that the short-term holder (STH) supply currently accounts for most of the market losses as these investors continue to buy the flagship crypto near local and global highs. As such, these holders automatically fall back into a loss whenever Bitcoin encounters a price correction. Data from Glassnode shows that 1 million BTC (26.6%) out of the 3.35 million BTC representing the STH supply are currently at a loss. An overwhelming 56% (1.9 million BTC) of the STH supply is said to have moved into an unrealized loss when Bitcoin recently experienced a price drawdown to the $58,000 level. Related Reading: Popular Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Outperform Bitcoin As Market Enters Meme Coin Super Cycle Glassnode also revealed that a “significant cluster” of STH coins was accumulated close to the current spot price. This is significant considering how investors who invested in this region could react to any volatile price fluctuations, irrespective of what direction they take. A significant drop or increase in Bitcoin’s price could lead these investors to offload their tokens. Besides these short-term holders, Glassnode suggested that the ‘Single-Cycle holders’ are another group of investors to keep an eye on. These investors have been holding a “significant magnitude of unrealized profit” since Bitcoin broke above the $40,000 range. They already took some profits when Bitcoin hit its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,000 in March and will likely offload more of their tokens as Bitcoin reaches a new ATH.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-surge-to-71000/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/29038014.jpeg

Soft U.S. economic data, rate cuts could foreshadow dovish a Fed meeting next week.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is increasingly compressed in a narrow range as the latest effort to rally past $72,000 stalled Thursday.

Well-followed market analyst Skew noted concerted spot selling activity on crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase, and a simultaneous built-up of short perpetual futures positions on derivatives marketplaces, weighing on prices.  CoinGlass data shows a significant leverage built-up around the $70,000 and $72,000 price area that could be liquidated in case of a breakout from the narrow trading range in either direction.

Despite bitcoin's struggle to get past the $72,000 level, analysts call for an imminent break upwards to new record highs as macro conditions are turning in favor of risk assets.  Central banks in the developed economies have started easing monetary policy, with the ECB and the Danish central bank both cutting benchmark rates by 25 basis today being the latest examples. Bank of Canada lowered rates earlier this week and its Swiss counterpart cut in March.  The big question going forward is if the U.S. Federal Reserve might join the rate cutting trend, and while some members of that central bank have suggested any monetary easing could be a 2025 story, recent data has shown softening in both inflation and economic growth. Tomorrow will bring the government's May employment report and a weak read could boost the odds of an imminent Fed rate cut.  And coming later this month will be the latest inflation data.

42417985,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcBR7,1717706243,"NYAG Sues 2 Crypto Pyramid Schemes, Promoters Targeting Haitian-Americans in $1B Scam","New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed suit against two purported crypto companies and their top promoters, a married couple, for allegedly operating two consecutive pyramid schemes that predominantly targeted Haitian immigrants to the U.S.  According to the complaint filed Thursday, the two schemes – AWS Mining and NovaTechFX – preyed on Creole-speaking church-goers via WhatsApp group chats, bilking investors out of more than $1 billion.  The first alleged scheme, an Australian company called AWS Mining, operated from 2017 until its collapse in 2019 and guaranteed investors a 200% return on their investment from crypto mining within 13-15 months. AWS Mining rewarded its promoters – including a Panama-based married couple originally from Florida, Cynthia and Eddy Petion – by giving them a 10% cut of the money invested by the new investors they recruited to the alleged scheme, along with bonuses and ceremonial titles.  The Petions were two of AWS Mining’s top promoters – each recruiting at least 200,000 investors to their “downline” – earning them both the ceremonial title of “President,” the suit alleged. After AWS Mining went bust in April 2019, the couple decided to start a new company together, NovaTechFX, with Cynthia serving as CEO and Eddy as COO. NovaTech claimed to be a crypto and foreign exchange trading platform that advertised up to 4% returns per week.  For their new company, the Petions allegedly recruited former promoters from AWS Mining – including Martin Zizi, James Corbett and Frantz Ciceron, who are also named as defendants in James’ suit – and, like AWS Mining, paid them a percentage of what the investors they recruited deposited in the platform.  Between August 2019 and April 2023, NovaTech’s investors deposited over $1 billion in the scheme, according to the complaint. In June 2022, shortly before the alleged scheme began to draw the attention of state securities regulators (who subsequently sent cease-and-desist letters to the company for fraud and securities violations) the Petions secretly sold their house in Florida and moved to Panama, James’ suit said.  Cynthia also advised her promoters to flee the U.S: “Leave the country,” Petion allegedly told Zizi. “They can’t serve you if they can’t find you lol.”  By December of 2022, the month after the spectacular collapse of crypto exchange FTX, many of NovaTech’s investors were requesting to withdraw their funds from the platform. In February 2023, the company halted withdrawals, and in May it shut down, failing to return “tens of thousands” of investors’ deposits and leaving them with “hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.”  Affinity fraud  According to the suit, the Petions and their employees largely preyed on Haitian immigrants in religious communities.  Cynthia Petion began calling herself “the Reverend CEO” after founding NovaTech, and claimed that God sent her a “vision” of the company while she was brushing her teeth, and called Jesus the “best affiliate market in the world”. The Petions and their promoters regularly hosted prayer groups where they advertised the alleged scheme, according to the complaint.  Zizi and the other promoters upheld Cynthia’s status as a visionary by likening her to American hero and abolitionist Harriet Tubman, telling investors that she had “helped thousands to see the light… and through her vision has created ways within the wilderness.”  NovaTech’s founders and promoters breathlessly marketed the scheme to investors – many of whom were experiencing financial hardship – as a path to becoming “the 1st millionaire in your family,” a way to “leave a legacy” and to gain “freedom from the plantation,” according to the complaint.  In private, however, NovaTech’s founders derided their investors as “a cult.” Cynthia Petion allegedly called herself a “Zookeeper” in a chat with one promoter, adding that her investors “join and follow mindlessly…they don’t think. They just agree with everything you say.”  Court records show the Petions previously filed for bankruptcy due to consumer debt in 2011.  The alleged affinity fraud committed by the Petions and the other NovaTech promoters closely mirrors that of EminiFX founder Eddy Alexandre, who also preyed on Haitian religious communities in a crypto pyramid scheme. In 2022, Alexandre was arrested and charged with fraud for stealing $240 million from investors. He pleaded guilty to commodities fraud in 2023 and was sentenced to 9 years in prison.  Lawsuits  James has accused AWS Mining, NovaTech, the Petions and the other named promoters of violating the Martin Act, New York’s strict anti-fraud law, as well as repeated and persistent fraud and repeated and persistent illegality. The suit is seeking damages and restitution for the victims, as well as permanent enjoinments preventing the Defendants from ever participating in another investment scheme.  The NYAG’s suit follows a class action lawsuit filed against NovaTech and Cynthia Petion earlier this year.  There are not currently any criminal charges against the Petions or the other promoters.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/06/nyag-sues-2-crypto-pyramid-schemes-promoters-targeting-haitian-americans-in-1b-scam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5f0c57e9ce1eecb49f3c0db83ad2ccb0e93da11-6000x4002.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Notably, the focus within the crypto market is poised to transition from Bitcoin to its contenders—altcoins—which are speculated to offer higher returns in the coming months. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Says Market Has Begun A Macro Bullish Expansion – What This Means For Bitcoin And Altcoin Prices Anticipating the Altcoin Uptick In These Months Prominent crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has been vocal about this impending shift. According to Van de Poppe, the period from late June to October could be pivotal for altcoins. This timeframe is expected to mark a significant rally, bringing altcoin values back in alignment with their “historical norms.” This anticipation is based on the current subdued movements and the foundational setups within the market that hint at a possible exponential rise. The #Altcoins are ready for their upwards run. I think we’ll be seeing a lot of momentum from late June until September – October. A repricing back to their normal values after the big cascade of the first period of the year. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 6, 2024 The underpinnings of the expected altcoin surge seem to be tied intricately to the movements of Bitcoin. Often seen as the bellwether for the broader crypto market, Bitcoin’s price fluctuations have a cascading effect on altcoins. Analysts suggest that if Bitcoin experiences a dip, it could catalyze a shift in investor focus towards altcoins. The rationale is that investors will start hunting for higher returns, which altcoins are poised to provide during such a market phase. Van de Poppe’s in-depth analysis indicates that this is more than mere speculation. Historical data and market dynamics suggest that altcoins gain momentum as Bitcoin consolidates or retracts. This pattern is expected to trigger a “recursive demand shock” for altcoins, propelling their prices to new heights. Market Indicators and Analyst Insights Recent market activities provide concrete data to support this analysis. The altcoin market cap, which has gradually increased, surged from $1.108 trillion last week to a current valuation above $1.166, marking a resurgence in investor interest and market activity. This is paralleled by insights from other market analysts who have observed critical technical patterns that suggest an impending alt season. For instance, a notable crypto analyst, Moustache, highlighted a breakout from the Gaussian Channel on several altcoin charts—a technical indicator often associated with significant price movements. According to Moustache, we witnessed substantial market rallies the last time Altcoins broke out of the Gaussian Channel. The current setup is very similar, and the market could be on the cusp of another major bull run. #Altcoins Friendly reminder: The last time Altcoins broke out of the Gaussian Channel and retested it was almost 4 years ago. Back then we also saw a buy signal in the supertrend as well as the EMA 10, which withstood the entire run. Altseason is very close imo.🎯 pic.twitter.com/ENxX3pk9hs — 𝕄𝕠𝕦𝕤𝕥𝕒𝕔ⓗ𝕖 🧲 (@el_crypto_prof) June 4, 2024 Furthermore, data from the analytics firm Santiment underscores this sentiment with specific examples.

29033229,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611789,1717700445,Bitcoin Approaching All-Time Highs: Why Is Retail Interest Rapidly Declining?,"Bitcoin is in an uptrend and will likely breach the all-important liquidation line at $72,000. At the spot rate, the coin is up approximately 25% from May lows and may rally, even breaking all-time highs of $73,800. Retail Interest In Bitcoin Falling Even As Prices Approach All-Time Highs Even as Bitcoin prints impressive higher highs, Mike Alfred, a “value investor” and an active crypto commentator, has identified a surprising disconnect: organic search engine traffic on Google is dropping. Apart from the spike in search from Q4 2023 till early January 2024, the trend has been southwards since then. The upswing in organic searches on Google during this period is primarily due to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) preparing to approve the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP At $0.75 In July Despite Year-Long Slump The excitement ahead of this milestone and the multi-year wait not only saw BTC prices rally but also improved sentiment. Subsequently, more people, mostly new to the industry, were eager to learn more about the digital asset. The rally from Q4 2023 has not fizzled and continues to spot rates. Bitcoin dipped in February before bouncing sharply, breaking $70,000 and printing new all-time highs at $73,800. Even though prices fell weeks later, dipping to as low as $56,500 in May, bulls are preparing to take higher prices. However, unlike the interest seen from Q4 2023 through early January 2024, organic searches, as mentioned, are unusually falling. Alfred argues that this divergence points towards an “institutionally driven bull market” and still “early.” In the past, and before the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, retailers played a big role in driving price and sentiment. However, institutions are in play with the products available in the United States. One observer notes that these market participants tend to exhibit “committed ownership,” negating the need for constant online searches. Encouragingly, the absence of retailers in this cycle–extending from the search in organic searches–signifies a drop in speculative buying. Subsequently, in the current state, the Bitcoin market is more liquid and stable than before. Increasing Awareness, Affordability A Reason? There are several explanations behind the drop in organic searches on Google and other search engines. Though institutions might be behind the rally, the decline is because the general awareness of Bitcoin has rapidly grown over the years. Of note, the availability of spot Bitcoin ETFs and widespread media coverage have boosted the coin’s recognition. Related Reading: Beyond BTC: Crypto Miners Get Brainy, Embrace AI After Block Reward Whacking Besides this, there is another aspect of affordability. With the price hovering around $71,200, purchasing a whole Bitcoin is out of reach for many.

MOTHER is the second-largest asset by market capitalization to emerge from meme coin factory Pump.Fun, the outpost partially responsible for flooding Solana with half a million new tokens in May alone, per The Block. Gamblers who bought MOTHER on Pump.Fun and held are sitting on a massive windfall. The top wallet had around $3,200 of the token on May 28; on Thursday morning its position was worth nearly $9 million.  Like many meme coins, MOTHER claims no value proposition whatsoever. Holders don't get payouts from album sales, as some royalty-infused NFTs do. They also lack the voting rights that some fan tokens issued by football teams carry. MOTHER's value is purely a function of demand for a coin that some speculators are betting might climb higher still.  Vitalik not impressed  All that froth has renewed scrutiny of so-called celebrity tokens.  On Wednesday, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin blasted celebrity tokens that tout ""financialization as a means to an end"" and lack some greater purpose. Hours later, Azalea subtweeted him with a photoshopped image depicting herself breastfeeding an infant Buterin. ""He was just hangry,"" she wrote, using slang for hunger-induced crankiness.  That cheeky aside brought more criticism from crypto's philosophical corner. Hayden Adams, creator of the decentralized trading protocol Uniswap who pioneered the token-swapping tech behind on-chain trading of meme coins and basically everything else, chastised Azalea for lampooning ""the best builder in the entire space"" while failing to harness her crypto foray for some higher purpose.  What began as a million-dollar joke has since spiraled into a debate about the point of crypto itself.  Early on Thursday, market-making kingpin Wintermute's Evgeny Gaevoy belittled Adams' and Buterin's efforts to ""solve capitalism."" ""Idk guys I’m with Iggy on this one🙃,"" he posted on X.  Risk factors  Still, MOTHER has a long way to go before graduating into the meme coin big leagues. Blockgraze, a pseudonymous crypto trader who turned $1,500 into millions of dollars by betting early on Dogwifhat (WIF), said celebrity coins such as MOTHER face more ""failure vectors"" than regular joke tokens.  ""In addition to all the ways a regular meme coin can fail you have all the added mistakes and risks from tying yourself to her personally. She can get bored, tweet the wrong thing, face personal legal action/whatever else,"" Blockgraze said.  Azalea's ascension as chief bull poster is helping prop up MOTHER's price in ways few other celebrity tokens have been able to attain. Her X posts circulate raunchy memes every hour dunking on the haters and fueling more attention – and hype – for MOTHER. She's also changed her profile photo to a Mad Lads NFT, the most valuable collectible on Solana.  ""The Iggy coin itself is only really interesting because she seems to be trying to stick with it and so far the price reflects people appreciating that,"" Blockgraze said.  (Celebrity) skin in the game?  Celebrities have a mostly infamous history with promoting cryptos. There's Larry David's flashy FTX super bowl ad, which spawned lawsuits from customers of the failed, fraudulent exchange. Ex-boxer Floyd Mayweather landed himself in hot water twice over scammy promotions. And Kim Kardashian faced SEC penaltiesfor boosting a token.  MOTHER differs from those in many respects, not least its closeness to the source. While it's unclear if Azalea herself created the token on Pump.Fun, it's technically plausible that she did. Regardless, she's been promoting the asset since its earliest moments.  The token's so-called ""dev wallet"" (Pump.Fun labels token creator wallets as ""devs"" despite needing no technical skill to make a token) held nearly $5 million of MOTHER Thursday.  Azalea wasn't immediately available for an interview Thursday. In a post on X in late May she outlined some of her reasoning:",NEUTRAL,없음,ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/06/iggy-azaleas-mother-meme-coin-turned-3k-into-9m-for-one-lucky-crypto-trader,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/adfc5552b74c74211806ebf435e33b381faaafd2-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to on-chain data, a particular SHIB trading expert is buying SHIB in massive amounts. This trader, known for making bank on Shiba Inu in its early days, now seems to be positioning for what could be a looming bull run for the meme coin. Shiba Inu Whales Enter Buying Frenzy Shiba Inu is home to a lot of crypto whales whose buying and selling patterns could influence other traders. As noted by on-chain analytics company Lookonchain, some whale wallets have been scooping up SHIB tokens massively in the past 24 hours. Amidst this accumulation trend is a particular purchase from a successful SHIB investor. According to Lookonchain, this investor has been buying SHIB crazily, spending 4,849 ETH worth $18.44 million to buy 715.9 billion SHIB tokens in less than six hours. Shiba Inu’s overnight shot to popularity among meme coin traders made many of its early investors crypto millionaires overnight. This trader, in particular, made more than $120 million in profit in the early days of SHIB by buying $400,000 worth of SHIB and selling for $121 million over two peaks in 2021. A $SHIB super big winner is buying $SHIB crazily, spending 4,849 $ETH($18.44M) to buy 715.9B $SHIB in the past 6 hours. This guy spent only ~$400K to buy 5.5T $SHIB in the early stage and sold for ~$121M at 2 peaks. He made more than $120M on $SHIB before, an amazing gain!😱… pic.twitter.com/iREp5jfj75 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 5, 2024 Interestingly, the purchases weren’t carried out in a single act, as Lookonchain noted they were made across three addresses. A closer look into etherscan data shows that the purchases were made in multiple transactions in each wallet, with respective balances now totaling 323 billion, 352 billion, and 234 billion SHIB tokens at the time of writing. What’s Next For SHIB? The peculiarity of the transfer, coupled with the investor’s successful run with SHIB, has caused many traders to speculate whether this could be an insider or probably one of Shiba Inu’s early team members. On the other hand, the whale’s buying pattern is a much-needed catalyst for an increase in buying pressure amidst a major decline in the SHIB burn rate. Related Reading: Popular Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Outperform Bitcoin As Market Enters Meme Coin Super Cycle In another social media post, Lookonchain revealed that nine wallets have spent $35.2 million to buy 1.356 trillion SHIB tokens at an average price of $0.00002596 in 12 hours.

Shiba Inu & Cardano Have Seen High Interest From Whales Recently In a new post on X, Santiment has talked about how some altcoins have been seeing a high Whale Transaction Count recently. The “Whale Transaction Count” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the number of transactions happening on any cryptocurrency network that are valued at $100,000 or more. Generally, only the whale entities are capable of moving such a large amount of capital with single transfers, so transactions of this scale are associated to movements related to them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges Past $71,000, But TD Sequential Says ‘Sell’ When the value of the indicator is high, it means the whales are making a large number of moves on the network right now. Such a trend could imply these humongous investors have an active interest in trading the coin. On the other hand, the metric being low could imply the big money investors may not be paying much attention to the asset currently as they aren’t making too many transactions. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Whale Transaction Count for three altcoins: Shiba Inu, Cardano, and JasmyCoin (JASMY). As displayed in the above graph, all three of Shiba Inu, Cardano, and JasmyCoin have seen the metric spike for them recently. Naturally, this means that the whales are actively trading these assets right now. As for what this could mean for the prices of these cryptocurrencies, a high whale transaction count can be a predictor for volatility. The indicator doesn’t contain any information about whether the transfers are tending towards buying or selling moves, though, so it can usually be hard to say about where exactly such volatility could take the asset. Since the transfers have started, however, all three of these coins have seen some level of price appreciation, hinting that the whale activity so far may have been leaning towards accumulation after all. The analytics firm also appears to believe that buying could be the goal behind these transactions. “The amount of $100K+ transactions on each of these networks have all more than doubled this week compared to usual 2024 averages, signaling accumulation,” notes Santiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Like A Spring Waiting To Uncoil, Analyst Explains Why Whatever the case be, if the high value of the Whale Transaction Count persists for Shiba Inu and company, it’s likely that their prices would continue to see some sort of fluctuations in the coming days. SHIB Price While JasmyCoin has seen a considerable amount of profits following the spike in whale interest, Shiba Inu has only been able to see a relatively minor surge. Following this latest rise, the SHIB price has so far been able to recover to $0.00002570.

Many advisors attended Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas, last week. I highlight the key themes that emerged from the event in Ask an Expert. I’m looking forward to next year's conference, which will be held in Toronto, Canada.  –S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Bitcoin Layer 2s  Bitcoin (BTC) has revolutionized the financial world with its decentralized, secure and transparent nature. Although it was the first cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH) pioneered the development of the entire decentralized finance, or DeFi, ecosystem. Now, Bitcoin is following suit, ushering in an era of development within its own ecosystem. As Bitcoin's popularity surged, so did the challenges related to its scalability and transaction speed. To address these issues, the Bitcoin community has developed various layer-2 blockchains, or L2s, which enhance the network's efficiency and functionality without altering Bitcoin's software itself. This article delves into the concept of Bitcoin layer 2s, exploring their classifications, benefits and expected advancements in this sector. By understanding these innovative protocols, users can comprehend how Bitcoin continues to evolve and maintain its relevance in an increasingly competitive digital landscape. In the end, the bitcoin cryptocurrency is the digital gold and the whole economy is being created around it, analogous to gold in the physical world.  Q: What are Bitcoin layer 2s, and how are they classified?  A: They are built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Transactions can be offloaded to them, addressing the Bitcoin blockchain's performance issues and limitations and adding programmability functionalities. There are three types of Bitcoin layer 2s:  1. State Channels  Function: Create external channels for transactions, which are recorded off-chain and updated as a single transaction on the main network at the end. You can compare it to a dedicated mailing route between houses that optimizes the cost of sending letters between them.  Example: Bitcoin Lightning Network.  2. Sidechains  Function: Semi-autonomous networks that maintain communication with the main network and can define their architecture. Imagine an optimized mailing system for a city that regularly syncs with the central office.  Examples: Stacks network, Rootstock Infrastructure Framework (RIF).  3. Rollups  Function: Serve as an execution layer that batches transactions and submits them to the main network’s consensus layer for final settlement. Imagine a whole state mailing system that updates its delivery status with the central body every 10 minutes. In the Ethereum ecosystem, examples include Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync and Starknet.  Types: Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups.  Example: Merlin Network, Build On Bitcoiin, B^2, Bitlayer.  Q: What problems do Bitcoin L2s fix, and why do they matter?  A:Bitcoin layer 2s address key issues to enhance the network's efficiency and functionality. First, they improve scalability by reducing congestion. As a result, the transaction fees are lower and their execution is faster, making Bitcoin more suitable for everyday use. L2s also increase the utility of bitcoin holdings and introduce complex smart contract functionality, enabling DeFi, NFTs and other Web3 applications. This enhanced programmability helps Bitcoin maintain market relevance. They expand Bitcoin's use cases and ensure smoother, more affordable transactions. Ultimately, Bitcoin L2s matter for users, as they allow new functionalities for BTC holders, such as usage of lending platforms, yield solutions or decentralized exchanges (DEXs). They serve as an alternative to Ethereum-based solutions for actors who hold an important part of their bitcoin portfolio.  Q: A comparison of existing Bitcoin L2s and what to expect in that sector this year.  A: Comparing Bitcoin layer 2s involves evaluating their technical classification. One should identify whether it is a state channel, rollup or sidechain. Additionally, metrics such as transaction fees, security guarantees and available decentralized applications, or dApps, on top of a network are crucial. The table below represents major Bitcoin layer 2s as of June 2024.  * BounceBit is not a layer 2 but a layer 1 proof-of-stake chain with BTC as the main currency.  ** Babylon is a BTC staking platform, implementing a novel approach allowing BTC staking.  Looking ahead, with no doubt, we can expect further expansion and the emergence of new Bitcoin layer 2s. Because of its scarcity and the fact that only about 21 million bitcoin will ever exist, it fundamentally makes sense to expand the programmability and functionalities of digital gold. The upcoming evolvement will include lowering transaction costs on the above L2s, adding further compatibility layers and implementing well-known primitives on top of Ethereum such as automation dApps or support of popular wallets.  Bitcoin has neither a floor nor ceiling in its value and cumulative market capitalization that sits today near $1.4 trillion. In its current form, the Bitcoin blockchain plays a foundational layer on top of which innovation can flourish. and today, that is materialized with layer 2s. Looking at the success of Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and zkSync, one can argue that we will have at least a few thriving ecosystems in that category. Therefore, it is vital to follow its evolvement and embrace the use of BTC as one of the fastest-growing narratives in 2024.  - Marcin Kaźmierczak, co-founder & COO, RedStone  Ask an Expert  Consensus Recap: The energy was positive at Consensus 2024 last week in Austin, Texas. Approximately 15,000 people attended, coming from a wide range of industries: service providers, custodians, crypto exchanges, ETF issuers, RIAs and advisors – all looking to connect. There was a lot of curiosity and engagement.  Q. What were the top themes that emerged?  EDUCATION was a top theme for the advisors we spoke with; the top theme was that it’s time to start learning about cryptocurrencies as an asset class.  Advisors also indicate the need to understand the RISK PROFILES of the different assets and how the price volatility could impact portfolios.  Advisors are curious about TOKENIZATION. They want to learn more about the problems it solves and understand its benefits to their clients over traditional investment vehicles.  Finally, understanding how COMPLIANCE will navigate digital assets and ETFs is crucial, especially as the regulatory environments continue to change and evolve.  Through this newsletter, we will continue to focus on these themes and provide deeper coverage of these topics as your source of information for advisors in the space.

42417977,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcBIr,1717688142,Cathie Wood's Ether ETF Pullback Is Likely Due to Fee War,"Cathie Wood's Ark has been a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies for years and is among firms that already offer a spot bitcoin ETF.  It joined with other firms applying to offer ether ETFs in the U.S. But then, within the past week, it bowed out without explaining why.  Chalk it up to the intense battle to lure customers with low fees for crypto ETFs, according to experts.  During a fireside chat at CoinDesk's Consensus conference in Austin, Texas, last week, Wood said ARK's spot bitcoin ETF, launched earlier this year, wasn’t making the firm any money because it charges investors such a low fee: 0.21%. While that's comparable to what other bitcoin ETF issuers charge, it's significantly lower than what non-crypto ETFs typically charge.  “Perhaps this is a simple business decision,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. “If Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) can eclipse $3.5 billion in less than five months and Ark can’t make any money, that’s obviously an issue.”  ETF issuers charge investors a fee to compensate for managing the fund. Many investors seek to minimize that fee since it cuts into returns.  In the race to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, Grayscale set its fee significantly higher than its competitors, at 1.5%, which appears to be one of the main reasons why investors have pulled billions of dollars out of the fund and the fund lost its early lead, in terms of assets, to BlackRock.  “I don’t think anyone truly expected the fee war to get that aggressive before we even saw launches,” said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.  Seyffart also believes that Ark made the decision based on the low fees. “It’s possible that the partnership made a ton of sense, particularly with the demand for bitcoin ETFs,” he said. “But after the fees got so low right off the bat, there might simply not have been enough money from fees to go around for both firms, particularly on an Ethereum ETF if they are expecting less demand versus bitcoin ETFs.”  Only one wannabe issuer, Franklin Templeton, has revealed the fee for its fund so far, which it set at 0.19% according to a filing, the same amount it charges for the Franklin Bitcoin ETF.  Despite the low fee structure of the ETFs, Ark’s departure from the race came as a shock, given the asset manager’s strong footing in the industry and its offering of multiple other ether-related funds.  “This is a surprising move from my perspective,” said Geraci. “From a longer-term branding perspective, I’m surprised Ark wouldn’t find value in being involved in the spot ether ETF category. Ark has been much more forward-thinking around crypto than many of their competitors, so it’s odd to see them sit this one out.”  A representative for Ark Invest could not be reached for comment.  CORRECTION (June 6, 2024, 15:48 UTC): Corrects to remove reference to Ark being the first to apply for an ether ETF.

29023821,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611795,1717686030,"VanEck Revises Ethereum Prediction To Put Price At $22,000, Here’s Why","Asset manager VanEck recently revised its prediction for Ethereum (ETH), revealing what price it believes the second-largest crypto token could reach by 2030. The firm also did well to outline what could drive Ethereum’s price to this revised price. Ethereum To Reach $22,000 By 2030 In a recent blog post, VanEck predicted that Ethereum could reach $22,000 by 2030. Before now, the asset manager had predicted that the crypto token would hit $11,800 by 2030. However, VanEck suggested they had become more bullish on ETH in anticipation of the Spot Ethereum ETFs, which could begin trading soon. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Forecasts A 4,000% XRP Price Run To $30, Here’s When They noted that these Spot Ethereum ETFs have caused them to revise their earlier prediction since these funds will allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold the crypto token. They believe this category of investors could bring new money into the Ethereum ecosystem, further driving up the crypto token’s price. VanEck projects that the Ethereum network will likely continue to enjoy rapid share market growth thanks to interest from traditional investors and Big Tech. They believe this, along with EETH’s dominance among smart contract platforms, could lead to a “create path to $66 billion in free cash flows” for the network. They base their projection of ETH’s valuation by 2030 on this, stating that these cash flows will accrue to Ethereum’s native token. A rise to $22,000 represents a return of around 487% from Ethereum’s current price and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.8%. Meanwhile, Ethereum reaching $22,000 will give it a market cap of around $2.2 trillion. Highlighting Ethereum’s Potential VanEck sounded very bullish on the Ethereum ecosystem as it claimed that the network could disrupt existing financial businesses and the largest tech companies, including Google and Apple. Given that Ethereum has earned a reputation as the platform for decentralized applications (dApps), they factored in the market size of business sectors that blockchain technology will disrupt while determining ETH’s future valuation. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Flatlines With 99% Crash, End Of The Road For SHIB? The asset manager also highlighted how ETH benefits massively from ETH’s potential since no action can be taken on the network without the native token. Additionally, they noted how 80% of the revenues earned on the network are used to buy back and burn Ethereum tokens in circulation. Meanwhile, VanEck believes that ETH is “a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world.” They referred to it as “Digita Oil” since it is consumed by those transacting on the Ethereum network. The asset manager also called it “Programmable Money” and “Yield Bearing Commodity” because of how automated the Ethereum network is and that validators earn yields on the crypto token when they stake their ETH. Lastly, it was referred to as the “Internet Reserve Currency” since it serves as the “base asset” for all activity and most digital assets with the ETH ecosystem worth over $1 trillion.",POSITIVE,ETH | SHIB,BUSINESS | ETH | ICO | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/vaneck-ethereum-price-22000/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/29023821.jpeg

The ecosystem uses the RBTC token, which is pegged 1:1 with BTC.  The integration comes around six months after Uniswap was deployed on the Bitcoin sidechain.  Decentralized exchange SushiSwap is now live on Bitcoin {{BTC}} sidechain Rootstock, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.  Launching in 2018, Rootstock is one of the most established projects aiming to introduce decentralized finance (DeFi) features to the Bitcoin network that are more commonly associated with the likes of Ethereum and BNB Chain.  It bills itself as the first Bitcoin sidechain compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). An EVM is a smart contract-executing software that powers the Ethereum protocol, comparable to an operating system on a computer.  Rootstock's goal is to combine the security of the Bitcoin network with the smart contract capabilities of Ethereum to provide a platform for building and deploying decentralized applications (dApps).  The ecosystem uses the RBTC token, which is pegged 1:1 with BTC.  The integration comes around six months after Uniswap was deployed on the Bitcoin sidechain. SushiSwap began life as a fork to Uniswap.  Rootstock's bridged total value locked (TVL) sits at just over $450 million, according to data by DeFi Llama.  Since the start of 2023, there has been an acceleration in the expansion of features to the Bitcoin network that have historically been the domain of Ethereum and others.  The starting point was the Ordinals protocol, which allowed a version of NFTs to be minted and store on Bitcoin, from which there have been numerous initiatives to make progress introducing smart contracts to the world's largest blockchain.

29021478,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611764,1717682429,"Solana (SOL) Maintains Bullish Trajectory Above 100-Day SMA, Rally Looms?","Solana (SOL) has shown remarkable market resilience by holding onto its position above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in spite of notable market turbulence. SOL has seen a lot of volatility in the last several months, but it has found firm support at this pivotal moving average, indicating a persistent positive mood. The ability of Solana to hold above the 100-day SMA shows that buying enthusiasm outweighs any downward pressure, providing a good basis for future upward momentum thereby attracting the attention of traders and investors. As of the time of writing, SOL’s price was down by -0.56%, trading at about $172. Its market capitalization was over $79 billion, and its 24-hour trading volume was over $1.9 billion. Both market capitalization and the trading volume are down by -24% and -22.39% respectively. Technical Analysis Of Solana This analysis was carried out using both the 4-hour and daily timeframe with the help of the 100-day SMA and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicators. Solana is currently moving in a consolidation manner, building up momentum above the 100-day simple moving average in the 4-hour chart. Judging from the price movement, it can be suggested that SOL might move upward. The 4-hour relative strength index is also actively positive as the RSI line is seen trending above the 50% level. From this RSI formation, it can be suggested that SOL will move down a bit closer to the SMA before making a good move in the upward direction. SOL on the 1-day chart also looks bullish as it attempts to move upward after rejection at the $160 support level. Thus at this point, It can be suggested that the price of SOL can still potentially move upward. Finally, we can see that the daily RSI is highly bullish because it rejected a downward move at the 50% level and started to rise again, indicating that the crypto asset is bullish and that the price could make a run for it. SOL’s Potential Price Movements As of right now, Solana is moving upward toward the $188 resistance level. If SOL’s price breaks this level, it will continue to move upward to test the $205 resistance level and probably move on to create a new high if it breaks above this $205 level. However, if it is unable to overcome this resistance level, it will start to decline in the direction of the $160 support level. Should it break below this support level it will continue to move down to test the $140 support level. Furthermore, SOL may witness a deeper correction to test the $118 support level on the chart if it breaks the above support level.

42417990,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcDS1,1717680915,U.S. Crypto Regulations Are Moving Against a CBDC and Non-Compliant Stablecoins Like Tether: JPMorgan,"Crypto regulatory initiatives have stepped up in the U.S. in recent months, JPMorgan said.  The stablecoin bill is most likely to be approved before the presidential election, and is a threat to tether’s dominance if passed, according to the bank.  Issuance of a central bank digital currency is less likely after the House passed a bill last month banning the Federal Reserve from doing so, the bank said.  U.S. crypto regulations seem to be moving in a direction that opposes the launch of a central bank digital currency, is against local banks embracing crypto and is averse to non-compliant stablecoins, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report.  The bank notes that regulatory initiatives have stepped up in the U.S. in recent months, raising questions about the direction of crypto regulation ahead of the presidential election later this year.  Emerging regulatory initiatives appear to be “against a Fed coin, against U.S. banks engaging with crypto, against non-compliant stablecoins such as tether {{USDT}} and against a blanket classification of all tokens outside bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} as securities,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a Wednesday report.  The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act has a higher chance of being approved before the election in November than three other initiatives, the report said. If passed, the bill will bolster U.S. compliant stablecoins, but would threaten the dominance of non-compliant stablecoins such as tether.  A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that’s usually pegged to the U.S. dollar, though some other currencies and assets, such as gold, are also used.  The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which was passed by the House of Representatives last month, still needs to be approved by the Senate and, ultimately, the president. That is unlikely to happen before the election, the bank said.  JPMorgan notes that Congress passed a resolution overturning the SAB 121 accounting rule, which made it harder for banks to custody crypto assets, but the resolution was vetoed by the president Joe Biden.  The Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Anti-Surveillance State Act is an attempt to block a U.S. CBDC and prevents Federal Reserve banks from offering certain products to consumers and from using a central bank digital currency for monetary policy, the report added. The House passed the bill banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC last month, however, its prospects in the Senate are unclear.

29018193,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611756,1717677617,"Beyond BTC: Crypto Miners Get Brainy, Embrace AI After Block Reward Whacking","The winds of change are blowing through the crypto mining industry. The highly anticipated halving event in April 2024, which sliced block rewards in half, has sent shockwaves through the ecosystem. Daily revenue for miners has plummeted by over 70% since the halving, forcing them to scramble for new avenues to secure their bottom line. Related Reading: Altcoins: Analyzing Key Signs For A Potential Boom – Or Bust Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI). Buoyed by the success of projects like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, AI computing is experiencing a surge in demand. This, coupled with potentially higher profit margins compared to Bitcoin mining, is making AI an increasingly attractive option for miners. AI: A Beacon Of Hope In A Volatile Sea Companies like Bit Digital are leading the charge, with AI already contributing nearly 30% of their revenue. Other industry players like Hut 8 and Hive are also dipping their toes into the AI pool. Adam Sullivan, CEO of Core Scientific, said: “The shift to AI allows us to create a diversified business model with more predictable cash flows.” This diversification is crucial in the face of the volatile nature of Bitcoin prices. By incorporating AI, miners are aiming to reduce their dependence on a single, often unpredictable, income stream. Mass Exodus Or Miner Metamorphosis? The impact of the halving isn’t limited to dwindling profits. Data suggests a potential shakeout within the mining community. A recent report indicates a significant drop in the Bitcoin network hashrate, a metric reflecting total mining power. This could signal a mass exodus of miners, particularly those with less efficient rigs struggling to stay afloat after the reward reduction. Further corroborating this theory is the recent flash in the Hash Ribbons metric. This indicator tracks the difference between short-term and long-term moving averages of hashrate, with spikes suggesting low mining activity or miner capitulation. Crypto hedge fund Capriole Investments interprets this as a potential “tempting Bitcoin buy signal,” suggesting the market might be reacting to a decrease in mining pressure. Mining pressure refers to the pressure on crypto miners to sell their Bitcoin. Miners earn Bitcoin as a reward for securing the network and typically sell it to cover operational costs like electricity and equipment. When pressure decreases, it often indicates that miners are less compelled to sell their Bitcoin.

Meanwhile, some analysts claim that institutional investors are showing renewed interest in Bitcoin, turning “risk-on” in their approach.

42418007,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcDld,1717677463,"First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Fluctuates Around $71K, Consolidating This Week's Rally","This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin fluctuated around $71,000 throughout the Asian and European mornings, following its rally earlier this week. BTC's price is little changed over 24 hours, trading in a range of $70,900-$71,100 for much of the morning in Europe, an increase of around 0.1%. Elsewhere, the broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) is similarly unmoved, up about 0.25% at the time of writing. Among the crypto majors, only ether is showing a change in excess of 1%. ETH is priced at just under $3,850, a rise of around 1.25% in the last 24 hours.  Robinhood agreed to buy crypto exchange Bitstamp in a $200 million all-cash deal. Bitstamp, founded in 2011, is one of the largest crypto exchanges in Europe, and will therefore provide a boon to Robinhood's global expansion plans. “The acquisition of Bitstamp is a major step in growing our crypto business,"" said Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood Crypto "" Through this strategic combination, we are better positioned to expand our footprint outside of the U.S. and welcome institutional customers to Robinhood.” HOOD shares rose 2.5% to $22.15 in pre-market trading following the announcement of the acquisition.  Van Eck set a 2030 target of $22,000 for ether, the native token of the Ethereum network. The firm, one of the prospective providers of a spot ether ETF in the U.S., wrote in a recent report that ether will soar to that level thanks to Ethereum's disruptive power and cash flow generated for token holders as well as the anticipated approval of the ETFs. VanEck wrote that the fuel driving the rally is that Ethereum-based technology can offer lower costs, increased efficiency and greater transparency. This shift could threaten to transfer significant market share from traditional financial and tech institutions, which cumulatively have a $15 trillion total available market, to blockchain-based services.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the correlation between BTC's price and the chances of a Donald Trump victory in the U.S. presidential election in November, according to Standard Chartered.  Trump is regarded as the more bitcoin-friendly candidate, given Biden's vetoing of Congress' efforts to repeal SAB 121.  Standard Chartered's head of crypto research, Geoff Kendrick, is predicting BTC to reach $100,000 by the election and $150,000 by year-end in the event of a Trump victory.

Binance can once again allow Mastercard users to purchase cryptocurrencies on the world’s largest exchange, after the card giant switched off that capability in August of 2023.  Last year’s decision by the card networks to part ways with Binance happened around the time the exchange was grappling with legal challenges in the U.S., including multiple charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  “Following an extensive review of the rigorous controls and processes that Binance put into place, Mastercard made the decision to allow Binance-related purchases on its network,” a Binance spokesperson said via email. “We look forward to adding support for further products, such as withdrawals, at a later date.”  Mastercard confirmed the restoration of service, but added a caveat.

Despite a discouraging decline in the value of the crypto asset relative to Bitcoin (BTC) and 88% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Morgan maintains a bullish outlook on the asset. In a post on X, Morgan outlined the struggles XRP has faced, particularly over the last year—a period that brought legal clarity and was expected to boost investor confidence in XRP. Morgan noted, “There were some who told us last month that XRP price had turned the corner in its steady decline against the BTC price. It has not and the decline over the last 6 months has been nearly -84%.” This decline has positioned XRP as one of the underperforming cryptocurrencies, being outshone by 88% of the top 100 coins in market performance. Morgan shared critical data to underscore the gravity of the situation, citing that the XRP to BTC exchange rate stands at 0.000007383 BTC, reflecting a dramatic decrease of -83.93% over the past six months. Related Reading: XRP Price Set For Colossal 63,000% Breakout As Ripple Secures Crucial Partnership In Europe Additionally, he pointed out that the cryptocurrency is trading below its 200-day simple moving average, a typical indicator of long-term market trends. Despite these bleak indicators, Morgan remains undeterred. When asked about his steadfast belief in XRP, Morgan responded metaphorically, comparing his faith in the digital currency to a nearly completed bridge that “can’t carry traffic until it’s fully built.” This statement suggests his view that digital asset’s potential will be fully realized only once the XRP Ledger is fully developed and the ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is completely settled. XRP Price Could Rally To $0.75 In July One of the crypto analysts who is still extremely bullish on XRP is Egrag Crypto. In his latest analysis on X, he pointed out that the monthly candle formation is showing a highly promising pattern, indicating a significant price surge in the near future. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Forecasts A 4,000% XRP Price Run To $30, Here’s When Egrag noted that the previous month’s candle displayed a 75% Inverted Hammer Formation at its base. In technical analysis, this pattern is considered a strong bullish signal, suggesting that sellers are exhausted and buyers are gaining strength, paving the way for a potential upward price movement. Egrag’s analysis emphasizes this formation as a key indicator that XRP is set for a notable price increase. Building on the bullish candle formation, the analyst predicts that the cryptocurrency could soon reach the $0.75 mark, with July 2024 being a crucial month. He confidently states the formation “is an amazing sign that $0.75 is coming in no time, and July 2024 is going to be the month of fireworks!” Addressing the community, Egrag encouraged patience and optimism, using the metaphor of “THOR’S HAMMER” smashing through all resistance to describe the anticipated market movement. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5286, marking a 0.65% decrease over the past 24 hours.

The company differentiates itself with its Bitcoin cloud mining business model and also engages in self-mining. BitFuFu has seen significant growth in revenue, mining capacity, and registered users, positioning itself as a leading cloud mining service provider. The miner recorded $144.4 million in Q1 revenue, surpassing Riot, CleanSpark, and Bitdeer in sales, and only trailing behind Core Scientific and Marathon Digital. The Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) post-halving period is what I’d like to refer to as “miners’ season.” It is a period where Bitcoin commences the bull trajectory (this has happened during the past three halvings) and Bitcoin miners who strategize operations to capitalize on the halving and its impact on the Bitcoin market cycle begin to record impressive financials. Business combinations and acquisition of growing miners are also common around Bitcoin halving. BitFuFu Nasdaq listing Ad (BitFuFu) BitFuFu ( FUFU ) was recently listed on Nasdaq following its successful SPAC merger with Arisz Acquisition in a $1.5 billion deal. BitFuFu ordinary shares subsequently commenced trading on Nasdaq on March 1. Following the business combination, BitFuFu obtained over $70 million through PIPE financing commitments from its existing shareholders and strategic partners, led by BITMAIN and AntPool. BitFuFu is a lesser-known, newly-listed Bitcoin mining company that holds all-round growth prospects - as we will see in this article. This is the first coverage of BitFuFu on Seeking Alpha, and in this article, I’ll go into detail about the company’s operations, its latest financial results, the management team, growth prospects moving forward, how the company diversifies its operations, and its competitive advantage among Bitcoin miners. Though Bitcoin miners run the same core business model (Bitcoin mining) on the basic level, each miner strategically diversifies its operations to maximize profits, spread business risk, and gain a competitive advantage among peers. For example, besides the core business of mining Bitcoin, Hut 8 ( HUT ) also offers high-performance computing ((HPC)) services, Bit Digital ( BTBT ) runs an AI business segment to diversify revenue and spread its revenue composition between Bitcoin mining and its AI business, and Core Scientific ( CORZ ) recently struck a $3.5 billion AI infrastructure deal with Nvidia-backed cloud service startup CoreWeave. Analyzing how a mining business spreads its operational risk through diversification is an important aspect of the fundamental analysis of Bitcoin miners. BitFuFu - Company and Financial Overview BitFuFu was founded in December 2020, a few months after the third Bitcoin halving. The company has grown in leaps and bounds since then, gained noteworthy backing, and is now known as a leading cloud mining service provider. Cloud mining is a process where users purchase mining contracts or rent hash power from a cloud mining provider. The provider then operates and maintains the mining equipment on behalf of the users, who receive a share of the mined cryptocurrency proportional to the amount of hashing power they've rented. The company’s board includes ex-employees at BITMAIN. The CEO Leo Lu, served as business director at BITMAIN and was responsible for co-founding the cloud-mining department at BITMAIN, as well as designing the cloud mining price model and developing other related digital asset products. Leadership differences at BITMAIN led to an internal power tussle, subsequently leading to the spin-off of the cloud mining department Leo Lu headed at BITMAIN. The spin-off led to the creation of Bitcoin miner Bitdeer ( BTDR ). Leo Lu would later go on to co-found BitFuFu. Currently, BitFuFu is BITMAIN’s sole cloud mining strategic partner. BitFuFu differentiates itself with its Bitcoin cloud mining business model. Cloud mining has been around for a while but lost the initial steam when a popular cloud mining platform called HashFlare, which started in 2015 and abruptly terminated in 2018, turned out to be a fraudulent operation . While cloud mining is BitFuFu’s core offering, the company also engages in self-mining. Q1 CY2024 operations highlights (BitFuFu) BitFuFu recorded about $100,000 in revenue when it started in December 2020 but has grown immensely and recorded $134.2 million in 1H 2023. For Q1 this year, the company recorded $144.4 million in revenue, representing a 149% YoY increase and surpassing both Q1 and Q2 2023 revenues. Q1 net income was $35.3 million, up an impressive 1216% YoY. GAAP EPS came in at $0.23. Pre deSPAC, BitFuFu’s full year 2023 results showed a 106.3% increase in mining capacity from 11.1 exahash as of December 31, 2022, to 22.9 exahashes on December 31, 2023. The company’s hashrate is split between its cloud mining and self-mining operations. Both operations have seen impressive growth. BTC produced from its cloud mining increased by 3,351 BTC from 3,405 BTC in 2022 to 6,756 BTC in 2023. Cloud mining registered users also increased by 61.5% from 118,460 users in 2022 to 304,470 users in 2023, according to data released by BitFuFu. Bitcoin produced from self-mining increased by 26.6% between CY2022 and CY2023, reaching 3,577 self-mined BTC. In Q1 this year, the company recorded another 5.5% increase in number of registered cloud mining users, reaching 321,184 users. The company’s mining capacity currently stands at 28.6 exahash. Miners' Q1 revenue (theminermag) FUFU, MARA, CORZ - EV/Sales comparison (Seeking Alpha) The improvements in capacity have grown the company’s top line impressively. Q1’s recorded revenue of $144 million places BitFuFu in third place, just behind CORZ and Marathon Digital ( MARA ), in terms of sales. At its current stock price of $3.87, its current market cap of $630 million, and EV of $645 million, FUFU currently has an EV/Sales of 1.74x and trades at 1.39x of sales. Several miners, including those BitFuFu surpassed in Q1 revenue, currently trade at higher premiums compared to FUFU. BTDR, CleanSpark ( CLSK ), and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), which all trial behind FUFU in Q1 revenue, trade at EV/sales ((TTM)) of 2.21x, 11.84x, 7.42x, respectively. Risks BITMAIN holds some leverage over BitFuFu. Besides leading BitFuFu’s fully committed PIPE financing just before the SPAC merger, and acting as a strategic partner, BitFuFu relies heavily on BITMAIN for renting Bitcoin miners and accessing facilities to scale its hashrate for cloud mining sales and proprietary mining. Such dependency gives BITMAIN some influence over BitFuFu's operations and strategic decisions. In Q1, BitFuFu paid $45.3 million to BITMAIN as a cost of revenue to a related party. BITMAIN, as a related party providing essential services to BitFuFu, may have leverage in negotiating pricing and fees for its mining equipment and access to facilities, as well as other business terms and conditions. Any strains in the relationship between BitFuFu and BITMAIN could adversely affect the former's operations and financial performance. In addition to the risk associated with the related party transactions between BitFuFu and BITMAIN mentioned earlier, it is worth mentioning that crypto assets, including Bitcoin, are inherently volatile assets and their regulation is still evolving. Hence, stocks of companies operating in such a volatile industry may experience sudden and significant volatility in their stock prices Bottom Line BitFuFu appears to have sufficient liquidity to support its expansion and capitalize on growth opportunities moving forward. The SPAC merger and the fully-committed PIPE financing provide a substantial capital infusion. FUFU’s short-term liquidity looks healthy. Based on the most recent quarter data, BitFuFu’s quick and current ratios stand at an impressive 2.92. The miner's cash and cash equivalent is slightly greater than its current liabilities, giving a cash ratio of 1.13; this suggests a balance between efficient cash utilization and maintaining a healthy cash reserve. With a co-founder and team who managed the cloud mining department at a notable mining company like BITMAIN, there is no doubt about the management’s expertise. The team keeps expanding and recently appointed Calla Zhao , a former auditor at KPMG and former head of finance at GGG limited, as CFO. With its lower valuation multiples compared to several of its peers, BitFuFu is a lesser-known, recently Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin miner that holds great upside potential moving into the imminent Bitcoin bull run.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4697741-bitfufu-the-lesser-known-bitcoin-miner-with-growth-potentials-fufu-stock?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29016710.jpeg

As of Thursday, crypto traders on Polymarket are betting 56% odds of Trump being in office, compared to 36% for incumbent Joe Biden.

The influx highlights professional investors' growing interest in the sector, according to Bybit.  Dogecoin and shiba inu were favored for their liquidity, with BONK the most popular new meme coin.  Institutional allocations to meme coins have climbed more than 300% this year, hitting an April peak of almost $300 million, according to crypto exchange Bybit.  The influx indicates how the sector is enjoying newfound favor among professional investors, Bybit said in a Wednesday report. Popular picks among institutional investors were dogecoin {{DOGE}} and shiba inu {{SHIB}}, mainly owing to their ample spot-market liquidity. Holdings were tracked exclusively on Bybit and do not include those on other exchanges.  Solana meme token BONK emerged as the most favored of the new meme coins that have come to prominence this year, attracting over $75 million in institutional bets.  Holdings dropped to by almost half to $125 million in May as the institutions took profits.  Stablecoin holdings fell during the period to $1.4 billion from $1.7 billion, while exposure to bitcoin {{BTC}}, ether {{ETH}} and meme coins increased.

Institutions allocated a larger proportion of funds to DOGE: 36% compared with retail investors' 24.5%.  “This suggests that while both groups view DOGE as a staple asset within the memecoin space, institutions favor it more, perhaps due to its higher liquidity and relative stability,” Bybit said. “Both cohorts also enjoy Ethereum-based memecoins (PEPE) and (SHIB), with retail users holding 20.95% and 14.61% respectively, compared to institutions' 22.23% and 10.39%.”  In recent months, meme tokens of the Ethereum and Solana ecosystem have gained prominence as a way to bet on the growth of a blockchain.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB | PEPE,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | PEPE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/06/meme-coin-institutional-holdings-surged-since-january-led-by-doge-shib-pepe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac62b6355bc79fe10527046707255f903b2969b8-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Barclays Capital and Galaxy Digital advised Robinhood and Bitstamp on the sale, the firms said.  “The acquisition of Bitstamp is a major step in growing our crypto business,"" said Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood Crypto ""Bitstamp’s highly trusted and long standing global exchange has shown resilience through market cycles … Through this strategic combination, we are better positioned to expand our footprint outside of the U.S. and welcome institutional customers to Robinhood.”  Bitstamp is a U.K.-based crypto exchange that was founded in 2011 and quickly became one of the largest crypto exchanges in Europe. It currently offers spot trading of over 85 cryptocurrencies as well as other crypto products including institutional lending and staking, among others. It is one of the most regulated on the market, holding more than 50 licenses and registrations globally, according to the release. It also undergoes regular audits by a global Big Four accounting firm.  Robinhood started offering crypto trading to clients in the European Union in December.  “Bringing Bitstamp's platform and expertise into Robinhood’s ecosystem will give users an enhanced trading experience with a continuing commitment to compliance, security, and customer-centricity,” said JB Graftieaux, CEO of Bitstamp, who along with the rest of the leadership team will remain in place following the sale.  The deal could ramp up the competition in the crypto exchange market as Robinhood's international expansion may take more market share from the likes of Coinbase (COIN), which is also pushing to grow outside of North America.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/06/robinhood-to-buy-crypto-exchange-bitstamp-in-effort-to-expand-outside-the-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/820dcf109ab32e6f366ed736f396006e08971426-6918x4612.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

29011227,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611734,1717666796,Altcoins: Analyzing Key Signs For A Potential Boom – Or Bust,"Altcoins are generating significant buzz among cryptocurrency watchers, as rumors of a potential Bitcoin breakout circulate. After weeks of sluggish trading, a recent surge of capital has revitalized the king of coins. This raises a pressing question: will altcoins ride the wave, or are they doomed to be left behind? Related Reading: AVAX Primed To Break $100 Barrier As Bullish Signs Emerge Whispers Of A Bitcoin Bonanza Data from Farside Investors reveals a significant shift in investor sentiment. Nearly $890 million flowed into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on June 4th, a clear sign of renewed interest. This surge in buying could act as a catalyst, sparking a wave of speculation and propelling Bitcoin prices upwards. However, the question remains: how will this newfound focus on Bitcoin impact the broader cryptocurrency market? Historically, strong Bitcoin rallies have often been followed by altcoin seasons, periods where alternative cryptocurrencies experience explosive growth. But is this time different? Altcoin Season: Just Over The Horizon? The Altcoin Season Index, a metric that gauges market sentiment towards altcoins, currently sits at a lowly 35. This stands in stark contrast to the readings of 80 observed just six months ago. This suggests that altcoins are not yet basking in the reflected glory of Bitcoin’s potential rise. Experts believe that even with a Bitcoin surge, only a select few altcoins are likely to outperform the market leader. To truly unleash an altcoin season, the Altcoin Season Index would need to climb above 75, a sign of widespread bullishness across the entire altcoin ecosystem. Why Altcoins Might Struggle To Shine The sheer number of altcoins compared to previous cycles also throws a wrench into the altcoin season equation. In 2017 and 2021, for instance, the altcoin market was a much smaller pond. When Bitcoin surged, investor money flowed more readily into a smaller pool of altcoins, leading to significant price increases across the board. Today, the landscape is vastly different. With thousands of altcoins vying for investor attention, any gains during an altcoin season might be concentrated in just a handful of high-performing projects, leaving the vast majority behind. Bitcoin Dominance: A Key Indicator To Watch Another crucial factor to consider is Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). This metric reflects Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. Historically, a significant decline in BTC.D has coincided with altcoin seasons. In early 2021, for example, the coin’s dominance level plummeted from 70% to 40%, paving the way for a period of explosive altcoin growth. Related Reading: Altcoin Alert: Notcoin (NOT) Poised For 5x Growth, Analyst Says Currently, however, BTC.D is on the rise, suggesting that altcoins are not yet the center of attention. Investors looking for altcoin opportunities should keep a close eye on this metric, as a sustained downtrend in the crypto’s dominance could be a harbinger of an approaching altcoin season.

42418002,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcDeP,1717661138,Crypto Remains Sidelined as EU Election Kicks Off,"Elections for the 700+ member of the European Parliament start today, with results due by June 9.  The vote is taking place as the bloc's crypto rules, MiCA, are set to kick in.  The new parliament isn't seen as demanding changes to MiCA in the immediate future, though it has the power to ask the European Commission for a report on whether changes are needed.  Residents of the 27 European Union countries have begun choosing their representatives in the multinational trading bloc for the next five years.  The election for members of the European Parliament (MEPs) starts today, with results expected on June 9. The more than 700 MEPs shape and decide on new laws, though they cannot initiate legislation and the final decision on adopting a law lies with the Council of the EU.  While the vote comes as the bloc's landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation starts to kick in, the new lawmakers are unlikely to make any immediate changes, said Blockchain for Europe Secretary General Robert Kopitsch. He pointed to current stablecoin rules, set to take effect on June 30, as one example.  The MEPs can call for the European Commission – the EU's politically independent executive arm responsible for proposing new laws and implementing decisions from the parliament – to propose a report on whether changes are needed.  ""Then the Commission can act and change certain provisions in MiCA in consensus with the core legislators, which is the Parliament and the Council,"" Kopitsch said last week in Austin, Texas at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 conference.  So far the industry has relied on MEP allies like Lídia Pereira from the grouping known as the European People's Party and Ondřej Kovařík from Renew Europe to push for pro-crypto rules.  ""Lídia Pereira was very involved and she's very young, from Portugal from the center right, and has a very good chance. And if she comes back, I think she's gonna be a great voice for digital technologies in general, but blockchain especially,"" said Tommaso Astazi, head of regulatory affairs at Blockchain for Europe, in Austin.  ""I also think Ondřej Kovařík should have a good chance and that will be great because he has been a great ally,"" Astazi said, noting that Kovařík, from the Czech Republic, has been very active in forums.  Both Kopitsch and Astazi said they expect to see more MEPs – including younger members – who might be more receptive to new technologies.  Shortly after being elected, the new MEPs help choose the new European Commission. New commissioners are expected to be chosen by October and have their priorities set by the end of the year, Astazi said.  Whether crypto will be a focus in the EU is mostly down to the next set of commissioners, Astazi said.

29006792,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611713,1717659922,Is The Bitcoin Price Manipulated? Experts Explain ‘Small’ Impact Of ETF Inflows,"The US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have been witnessing a historic run of inflows, marking 17 consecutive days of net additions. On a particularly notable Tuesday, these ETFs observed inflows totaling a staggering $886.6 million, ranking it as the second-highest single-day influx since their introduction. This was followed by another significant day of inflows yesterday, amounting to $488.1 million, with notable contributions from major financial players like Fidelity ($220.6 million), Blackrock ($155.1 million), and Ark ($71.4 million). Despite these hefty capital injections, the price of Bitcoin has demonstrated a relatively subdued response, inching from $68,000 to $71,000 since the beginning of the week. The muted price movement in the face of substantial ETF inflows has puzzled many market participants and analysts. Typically, such inflows are expected to exert a stronger upward pressure on Bitcoin prices. However, the observed price dynamics suggest that other counteracting factors might be at play. Why Is The Bitcoin Price Not Going Higher? Crypto trading analytics platform The Kingfisher offered an explanation via a post on X, suggesting that a carry trade strategy might be influencing the price dynamics. According to their analysis, “The BTC ETF inflows didn’t affect the price as much as you hoped it would? It might be due to a carry trade being loaded up. Short Futures + Buy Spot/ETF.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Soars Past $71,000: Here’s Why A carry trade in this context involves shorting Bitcoin futures while simultaneously buying spot Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETF shares. This strategy can hedge against potential price volatility and exploit discrepancies between futures prices and spot prices. JJ the Janitor (@JLabsJanitor) further elaborated on the strategy’s mechanics. He drew parallels with behaviors visualized on the PANDA Terminal charts, explaining, “When big boys want BTC spot filled they sell futures contracts to bring price into bids. When they’re filled + ready to let it rip they close those shorts, hence the inverse correlation on True Open Interest (OI).” His remarks hint at strategic market manipulations that, while legal, blur the lines between savvy investment tactics and potential ethical concerns. His follow-up tweet, “Market manipulation or savvy investment strategy….what’s the difference?” challenges the narrative by questioning the ethical implications of such strategies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Explode If Bulls Break The “Fuse” At $72,000 The discussion prompted further scrutiny from the crypto community. X user Sahra critiqued the practical implementation of the carry trade, noting, “Carry trade should suppress funding rates naturally. Long spot pressure against the perpetual should in theory cause perpetual rates to drop (all else being equal) as perpetual would begin to lag spot. Everything else makes sense, but these rates are far too low to justify a carry IMO.” This comment points to the complexities of carry trades, where expected outcomes like suppressed funding rates are not aligning with market observations, suggesting that other forces might be influencing the market. The Kingfisher responded to Sahra’s skepticism, acknowledging the anomaly: “That’s right, the funding remains fairly positive though. This suggests that while a carry trade could be in play, it’s not the dominant force in the market. Other factors, like bullish sentiment or other buying pressures, might be offsetting the expected downward pressure on funding rates from the carry trade.” At press time, BTC traded at $70,803.

Beyond technical indicators, the buzz surrounding Avalanche stems from exciting developments brewing within its ecosystem. The project’s developers are gearing up to launch Layer 1 blockchains (L1s) that inherit Avalanche’s secure and scalable consensus mechanism. This innovation could significantly simplify the process of launching new blockchains, similar to how ERC-20 tokens are built on top of the Ethereum network. Furthermore, Avalanche’s CEO, Emin Gun Sirer, recently teased a novel concept – Initial Chain Offerings (ICOs). Unlike the traditional Initial Coin Offering (ICO) model where individual tokens are sold, ICOs would involve offering entirely new blockchains to investors. This paves the way for a potential “Avalanche ICO season,” mirroring the ICO boom witnessed in the early days of cryptocurrencies. Market observers believe this could attract a surge of interest and investment into the Avalanche ecosystem, potentially boosting the price of AVAX. Key Resistance Levels To Watch Moving on to the price targets, analysts have identified key resistance levels at $50 and $60. Overcoming these hurdles could propel AVAX towards its ambitious long-term target of $100. However, the confluence of bullish technical indicators and groundbreaking developments within the Avalanche ecosystem is undeniable.

28996849,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611614,1717642830,"Bitcoin Surges Past $71,000, But TD Sequential Says ‘Sell’","The Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has given a sell signal for Bitcoin after the asset broke past the $71,000 level in the past day. Bitcoin TD Sequential Is Giving A Sell Signal Right Now As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, a TD Sequential signal has appeared in the 1-hour price of Bitcoin. The “TD Sequential” refers to an indicator in technical analysis (TA) that’s generally used for locating probable points of reversal in any commodity’s price. The TD Sequential involves two phases: setup and countdown. During the first of these, candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) are counted to nine. After these nine candles are in, the asset may be assumed to have encountered a turnaround. Related Reading: Bitcoin Like A Spring Waiting To Uncoil, Analyst Explains Why Naturally, if the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were red, the TD Sequential would give a buy signal for the asset. On the other hand, green candles would imply a potential reversal towards the downside. After the setup is over, the countdown phase begins. This second phase of the indicator is much like the first one, except for the fact that the number of candles to be counted here is thirteen rather than nine. The countdown’s completion implies that the price has encountered another likely point of reversal. A TD Sequential phase of the former type has recently been completed in the 1-hour price of Bitcoin. Below is the chart shared by Ali that shows this pattern in cryptocurrency. From the graph, it’s visible that TD Sequential has recently finished its setup phase with green candles for Bitcoin. This signal comes as the coin has surged beyond the $71,000 level for the first time since mid-May. This TD setup would mean that the party could already be over for now as the coin may have reached a local top, and a reversal to the down direction could be coming. While the TD Sequential could spell a worry for BTC in the short-term, another TA indicator could point towards a bullish outcome for the asset instead. As CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has pointed out in an X post, the Bitcoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at a level where recent uptrends have begun. The RSI tracks the magnitude of recent changes in the price of any given asset. As the chart shows, the 14-day RSI currently has a value of 56% for BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Not ‘Overvalued’ Yet, Says CryptoQuant CEO: Here’s Why Usually, the price is considered to be undervalued when this metric drops below 30%. Strangely, the last three major uptrends in BTC began when the RSI had a value of 56%. This could be a coincidence, but BTC could see a sharp surge soon if it’s truly a pattern. BTC Price Despite the appearance of the TD Sequential, Bitcoin hasn’t let off yet, as the asset has climbed beyond $71,600.

28994800,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611618,1717639206,"Bitcoin Will Explode If Bulls Break The “Fuse” At $72,000","Bitcoin’s price has risen roughly 2% in the past 24 hours, trending above $70,000, a psychological level. As bulls prepare for more gains, Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, believes the coin could soar even higher after breaking above the all-important resistance level at $72,000. Will Bitcoin Soar To $75,000 Due To A Short Squeeze? Even after the spike on May 20 lifted the coin above $66,000 after days of lower lows, taking Bitcoin to $56,500, bulls didn’t follow through. As things stand now, Bitcoin is within a broader range, capped at $72,000, the first local support, and $73,800, the all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Reaches Historic Low: Calm Before A 500% Bullish Storm? However, a breach would be significant considering the significance of $72,000, a level that has only been retested but not broken in several weeks. One explanation for potential price expansion is that a breakout, ideally with rising volume, might signal the start of another leg up, drawing demand. For Woo, closing $72,000 could see prices fast expand, even breaking $75,000 because of a short squeeze. Once bulls pierce and close above this level of interest, there would be a wave of liquidations, where many short positions are forced to close, driving prices higher. Based on Woo’s analysis, roughly $1.5 billion worth of short positions will be liquidated “all the way up to $75,000.” If this happens, then it is highly likely that Bitcoin will register new all-time highs roughly seven weeks after Halving. Inflow To Spot BTC ETFs Rising, Demand Will Only Continue Rising Underpinning this bullish sentiment is the impressive surge in institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on June 4. According to sosovalue data, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers bought $886.6 million worth of BTC yesterday. Fidelity bought $378.7 million of BTC, while BlackRock, behind the largest spot BTC ETF, bought $274.4 million of the coin. Bitwise also made a substantial demand, adding $61 million of BTC. Interestingly, Grayscale also saw inflows, adding $28.2 million of BTC on behalf of its clients. This influx was the second-highest daily inflow volume since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Flatlines With 99% Crash, End Of The Road For SHIB?

The demand for these complex derivatives will only increase. Yesterday, the Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the country’s first spot Bitcoin ETF.

However, recent positive developments and announcements surrounding Ripple, the blockchain payment company associated with XRP, coupled with an intriguing bullish pattern, have sparked speculation of a potential massive uptrend for the XRP price. Ripple Expands With Clear Junction Partnership Ripple recently revealed its partnership with Clear Junction, a global provider of cross-border payment solutions for regulated institutions. According to the announcement, the new collaboration aims to enable Clear Junction to facilitate “instant and secure” GBP and EUR-denominated payout coverage for Ripple’s payments customers. Moreover, Ripple plans to introduce support for additional currencies later this year, further expanding its network of offerings. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Flatlines With 99% Crash, End Of The Road For SHIB? Cassie Craddock, Managing Director, Europe at Ripple, expressed satisfaction with the partnership, stating the following: Clear Junction is a great fit for Ripple. Right from the beginning, it has been able to support all of our use cases, including providing GBP and EUR payout coverage for our clients sending payments into the UK and European Union. Clear Junction, an FCA-authorized e-money institution in the UK, offers operational support and reports to provide a secure environment for partners. The goal is to ensure the safety and protection of funds through necessary payment industry and data security safeguards. The company has earned ISO 27001 certification, the highest global data security standard. Dima Kats, Founder and CEO at Clear Junction, emphasized the significance of the partnership, stating that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will be at the core of the evolution of correspondent banking. Kats further states: We are happy to partner with Ripple to be a part of this process. This collaboration exemplifies two institutions coming together to enhance their respective products and services. We look forward to working closely with the Ripple team and exploring more avenues for future growth. XRP Price To $300? Presently trading at $0.5269, XRP is experiencing a prolonged consolidation phase between the price range of $0.4780 and $0.5441. Despite lacking significant catalysts to propel the token to previous highs, the possibility of retesting its all-time high of $3.40 in January 2018 is on the horizon. A crypto analyst known as “Jack The Rippler” has identified a bullish triangle pattern emerging in the daily XRP price chart, as seen in the image below. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals Top 3 Trades To Take Now Should the pattern fully break out above the $0.600 mark and the anticipated bullish uptrend materialize, as indicated by the analyst, the projected 63,000% surge would skyrocket the XRP price to approximately $331. Nevertheless, the realization of this scenario remains uncertain, and the timeframe required for XRP to overcome its upper resistance levels is yet to be determined. The upper resistance levels currently stand at $0.5414 and $0.5574 in the near term.

28990584,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611623,1717632002,Is $100K Bitcoin Inevitable? This Expert Say ‘Yes’—Find Out When,"As Bitcoin teeters close to its previous peak, discussions about its next big price targets have reignited. Among the voices contributing to this conversation is Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and a prominent Bitcoin advocate. Recently, on X (formerly Twitter), Mow expressed his belief in Bitcoin’s imminent rise to $100,000, a milestone he sees as a stepping stone toward an eventual value of $1 million. His forecast is based on events triggered by breaking past the all-time high of $73,750 in March. Related Reading: Buckle Up: Bitcoin’s Ride to $74K Could Start Any Minute – Here’s Why Critical Factors To Drive Bitcoin Price To $100k Target Mow outlines a cause-and-effect scenario that could catapult Bitcoin to these new heights. First, surpassing the previous all-time high would initiate a “recursive Bitcoin demand shock,” as increased demand and limited supply drive prices upward rapidly. According to Mow, this chain reaction could swiftly elevate Bitcoin to the $100,000 mark. Once we surpass the previous #Bitcoin ATH, recursive demand shock kicks in and it’s up all the way to $0.1M. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) June 5, 2024 His confidence is mirrored in the recent market behavior. Despite a minor pullback from its 24-hour peak of $71,312, Bitcoin has maintained an upward trajectory, gaining 1.7% in the past 24 hours and nearly 5% over the past week. Supporting Mow’s optimistic outlook, Chris Vermeulen, Chief Market Strategist of The Technical Traders.com, shares a technical perspective that aligns with Mow’s predictions. In a detailed analysis, Vermeulen pointed out a cup and handle formation on the chart, a bullish signal suggesting significant potential for an upward breakout. He uses Fibonacci extensions to project that Bitcoin could soon reach targets of $80,000 to $90,000, possibly climbing as high as $106,000. Market Dynamics And Long-Term Prospects Both experts view the current market dynamics as a prelude to more substantial gains. Vermeulen’s analysis not only supports Mow’s prediction but extends it by suggesting that Bitcoin could encounter resistance around $100,000, a psychological barrier likely to prompt significant market reactions. Beyond this point, a consolidation phase might occur, but the long-term trajectory remains overwhelmingly positive. The broader financial context also plays a critical role in these forecasts.
