42402714,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcVhz,1553720407,HSBC Exec Urges CFTC to Make More ‘Positive Noise’ About Blockchain,"A banker from HSBC urged the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to make more ""positive noise"" about distributed ledger technology (DLT), in order to encourage adoption by hesitant businesses.  Among other recommendations for the agency, ""it would also be beneficial if the CFTC would give some positive words around DLT and DLT adoption,"" HSBC senior vice president Jesse Drennan said during the regulator's Technology Advisory Committee meeting Wednesday.  Adoption of the tech is not exactly ""being hindered right now,"" Drennan explained, but firms looking to either go live with a DLT platform or otherwise bring the tech into production typically review how regulators are looking at the technology.  Part of their concerns may stem from not being clear about how the regulator may feel about the technology – even outside strict regulatory standards.  ""Certainly there is a sensitivity to how the regulator may feel about such technology and supporting the activity that the parties are rolling out,"" Drennan said, adding:  ""So wherever the Commission could make positive noise, that may accelerate for some firms their ability to bring it to market as it overcomes that bit of due diligence about just having the conversation around how you feel about the use of the technology to support the activity that they are pursuing.""  Crypto Dad's crew  To be fair, CFTC's leadership has already been vocally supportive of both enterprise DLT and even cryptocurrency, to the degree that the commission's chairman, Christopher Giancarlo, earned the nickname ""Crypto Dad"" after a congressional appearance last year.  Just yesterday, Daniel Gorfine, who heads up the CFTC's fintech initiative LabCFTC, published an essayhttps://fintechpolicy.org/2019/03/26/valuing-cryptocurrencies-as-currencies/ analyzing the nature of cryptocurrencies with an eye toward valuing them as traditional currencies – and how doing so may benefit the space more broadly.  Drennan's comments came near the end of the day-long meeting, which saw representatives from industry lobbyist Coin Center, IBM, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and DLT builder R3 all meet to discuss the state of the crypto and DLT space.  In his opening comments, CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz, who sponsors the committee, noted that the group's DLT and market infrastructure subcommittee would discuss both the current state of the technology as well as any challenges that may be standing in the way of wider adoption.  ""The panel will also explore if there are specific areas where CFTC regulation may be inhibiting the adoption of DLT or additional areas where further guidance from the agency could support further development,"" he said.

""The reason is, like everyone, we didn't do particularly great last year, but we did better than the market. And that was a win,"" Arrington told CoinDesk. With the additional investment, Arrington says the fund has now surpassed its initial target of raising $100 million.  First announced at Consensus: Invest 2017, the TechCrunch founder has never disclosed his eponymous fund's LPs (other than to indicate that Ripple is not one of them).  The fresh capital enabled the company to acquire another fund, Australia's ByteSize Capital, founded by brothers Ninos and Ninor Mansor, who have joined Arrington XRP as partners. Arrington also announced that Experian alum Geoffrey Arone will move from being a partner to an advisory role.  Ninos Mansor said he appreciated the experience that Arrington and fellow Arrington XRP partner Heather Harde brought to the table:  ""One thing that stood out to us as we discussed a merger was the fact that they've been working together for over a decade. Two tech booms gives you scars and judgement that you just can't replicate.""  Adapted strategy  The ByteSize acquisition allows the fund to operationalize what Arrington called a ""barbell strategy,"" designed for an uncertain market, where venture investments are balanced by crypto trading.  Trading should improve the fund's performance in both bear and bull markets, but Arrington emphasized that venture investing will remain a major emphasis for the fund.  ""We are seeing a new market,"" he said. ""It's not 2017. It's not 2018. Funds like ours will continue to find ways to make money in markets that are unpredictable.""  He explained that much of the loss in 2018 wasn't due to poor venture investments, but leaving funds in crypto, rather than fiat. ""These great deals we all did, it just didn't matter,"" Arrington said. ""We'd still put it right back into ETH and we'd lose it.""  Arrington believes the addition of the Mansors will be able to help offset such losses.  ""We didn't have the DNA to do trading, but now we do with these guys,"" Arrington said. In addition to trading know-how, Arrington says the ByteSize team has proprietary market analysis tools that will come over with the acquisition.  ""We are very excited to deploy these strategies at scale,"" Ninor Mansor told CoinDesk, adding:  ""This is exactly the right time to be joining forces, when most are checking out.""

42402715,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcViy,1553698812,Lightning Offers Growth Path for Emerging-Market Crypto Exchanges,"While leading cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance feverishly add new tokens, smaller exchanges serving emerging markets are pivoting toward retail applications of the lightning network’s bitcoin scaling solution.  The latest is Singapore-based exchange Zebpay, which now offers lightning wallet options for users who want to send lightning-enabled payments to external wallets.  Bitcoin users can cash out their crypto directly to make a nearly instant payment to any lightning-friendly wallet. For now, Zebpay will enable this feature by handling all the channels to recipients on the back-end.  “Next comes allowing people to create invoices,” Zebpay CEO Ajeet Khurana told CoinDesk. “Giving them greater control over channel management, state management, recovery, routing. All of this is done by us. We will keep releasing more functionality so that users can actually take control of how they are doing things.”  This stands in stark contrast to the broader industry norm, which often considers lightning too experimental for retail users. Representatives from larger platforms like Coinbase, BitMex, Kraken and OKEx all told CoinDesk they won’t incorporate lightning in the near future.  In contrast to the above-mentioned platforms, Khurana said Zebpay has a smaller monthly user base of a “few hundred thousand” – which could still make the company’s new lightning wallet one of the more widely used options on the market (BlueWallet, by comparison, has seen 20,000 downloads to date).  Demand for the product may also benefit from the fact that nearly a million Indian Zebpay accounts holders can’t cash out in fiat due to an unclear regulatory landscape that discourages Indian banks from cooperating with crypto companies.  “I cannot imagine greater pain for an organization,” Khurana said, referring to the choice to shut down the Indian fiat-crypto exchange and shift Zebpay’s focus to other markets and services. He described this shift as basically having to “start over” again. Yet despite these challenges, Khurana remains bullish on the global bitcoin industry.  “It is very, very exciting,” Khurana said, adding:  “We are still in the early stages, of [lightning] implementation. But as far as capabilities are concerned, that question of whether bitcoin can actually support the volume of transactions that would emerge from a global monetary system, that [question] has now effectively been put away.”  Lightning now is part of the exchange's strategic plan for expanding beyond simple exchange services. This wallet functionality is the first step.  Khurana told CoinDesk he is also interested in offering a variety of lightning-enabled services in the future, such as payment processing. This may prove to be especially important since Khurana said the vast majority of Zebpay users at in-person events have indicated they “didn’t have exposure to other asset classes” like stocks or real estate.  Global use cases  Although Zebpay may lead the way for Indian bitcoin users who are learning about lightning, it isn't the first exchange to prove lightning integration can prove commercially viable.  The Chile-based bitcoin exchange Buda.com, a small exchange facilitating roughly $200,000 in daily transaction volume from around 1,500 monthly users, enabled this same payment feature last October. Buda.com software engineer Alejandro Echeverría told CoinDesk 100 customers have used this lightning feature so far and, from integration to channel management, the additional cost to the exchange has been less than $5,000.  Much like Zebpay’s Indian users, Buda.com’s users in Colombia often find that banks won’t allow them to purchase bitcoin or interact with crypto companies.  Plus, Venezuelan expats in Peru, Chile and Colombia may all need to send bitcoin without relying on Venezuelan banks. Lightning wallets make these transactions much cheaper than regular bitcoin transactions, helping users overcome liquidity issues.  “Some users used Bitrefill to send money to Venezuelan mobile accounts, to top off their family cell phones,” Buda.com co-founder Agustín Feuerhake told CoinDesk. “It’s a lot easier if you have your bitcoin on an exchange than running your own [lightning] node or opening channels.”  Feuerhake went on to say his exchange will add both mobile lightning options and the ability to receive payments within the next few months, followed by an experimental roll-out of merchant payment processing services later this year for small businesses such as hairdressers.  “Most of the users are more concerned with making [bitcoin payments] fast and easy,” Feuerhake said. “We received interest from large merchants. But we will start with smaller businesses with a simpler view of accounting.”  Both Khurana and Feuerhake agreed that the current crypto industry is oversaturated with exchange options. From their perspective, companies that are able to offer services, such as mobile wallets, institutional custody and payment processing, will succeed in the long-run.  “Who among the exchanges will remain competitive?” Khurana asked. “I think these are going to be the ones that innovate.”  Ajeet Khurana image via Zebpay",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/27/lightning-offers-growth-path-for-emerging-market-crypto-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bb958806076b7493ba0c87d2d20dc21c47b81a7-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402696,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcVTE,1553697059,Avalon Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan Is Plotting Another IPO Attempt,"Canaan Creative, manufacturer of the Avalon bitcoin miner, is considering another attempt to go public, people familiar with the situation said.  According to one source, the company’s main shareholders are discussing a plan to list its shares on the newly created Science and Technology (Sci-Tech) Innovation Board within the Shanghai Stock Exchange.  The source added the plan is still under discussion and has not been finalized. But the news comes weeks after the Nasdaq-like trading board debuted in China to meet demand from local technology startups, and just months after Canaan’s application to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lapsed.  A second source close to the company told CoinDesk that the company has been considering both China and the U.S. for a new application, and has even communicated with the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. This source also indicated the plan has yet to be finalized but said it will be before the end of the year.  Canaan did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.  The Shanghai exchange, the world’s fourth-largest stock exchange by market capitalization as of 2018, formally launched the new trading board on March 1, four months after Chinese President Xi Jinping revealed the plan to help domestic tech startups raise funds more easily.  New round, old faces  Canaan is considering a second stab at going public on the heels of a recent funding round, which one news report said raised “several hundred million dollars,” valuing the firm at “several billion dollars.”  However, CoinDesk has learned that the funding round drew no new investors.  “There was a fund raise, but there’s no real investors because it all comes from old shareholders’ own pockets,” said a third source close to the company, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information is private.  While continued investment by existing shareholders might be read as a vote of confidence in the company, the absence of new participants is likely a sign of how tough fundraising is for mining operations given the ongoing slump in cryptocurrency prices.  The source close to Canaan drew the latter interpretation, saying:  “Based on the current bearish market situation, it’s just too difficult to gain investment.”  ‘Red chip’ candidate  Notably, the report of a multi-billion dollar valuation for Canaan came just after the publication of the Shanghai exchange’s listing rules for startups seeking to raise money on the new board.  Prospective issuers include what the government calls “red chip” companies – those that are incorporated overseas but operate businesses inside China. This would include Hangzhou-based Canaan, whose holding firm Canaan Inc. is incorporated in the Cayman Islands.  To be listed on the new board, a red chip applicant must have either a valuation larger than 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion), or a valuation no less than 5 billion yuan ($750 million) but revenue of over 500 million yuan ($75 million) in a recent year.  Before the recently completed round, Canaan might not have made the cut. In May 2017, it raised $43 million in a Series A round, which valued the firm at around $430 million at the time. According to Canaan’s initial public offering (IPO) prospectus in Hong Kong, it netted $56 million of profits on $200 million of revenues in 2017.  And Canaan’s interaction with the Chinese government has long been visible. On April 24, 2018, Yang Jiang, the vice president of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, paid a visit to Canaan Creative’s Hangzhou office.  During the visit, Jiang reportedly commented: “Whatever applications your chips will be used for, essentially you are still a chip company. I hope that you will go public on the domestic market.” Canaan published a post with the comment from Jiang on its WeChat platform, but the article was later removed.  Existing shareholders  While the third source would not say which shareholders contributed to the new round or the exact amount raised, Canaan named its largest existing shareholders in the Hong Kong IPO prospectus.  According to the filing, the company’s main shareholders include chairman and co-founder Nangeng Zhang (17.6 percent), co-founder and executive director Jiaxuan Li (17.2 percent), and co-founder and former director Xiangfu Liu (17.61 percent).  Further, Jianping Kong, an executive director, and Qifeng Sun, a non-executive director, own 7.8 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in Canaan.  The remaining 34.69 percent was categorized as owned by “other shareholders.” The largest among them (8.78 percent) is a Hangzhou-based firm called Jiaji Information Technology Limited.  Attempts to reach these publicly identified shareholders by press time were unsuccessful.

42402697,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcVSF,1553691620,Most Crypto Exchanges Still Don't Have Clear KYC Policies: Report,"The crypto exchange industry may be far less compliant than it appears.  As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, a global study of 216 exchanges by the reg-tech startup Coinfirm found 69 percent of these businesses do not have “complete and transparent” know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. The study also found that only 26 percent of exchanges had a ""high"" level of anti-money laundering (AML) procedures, such as ongoing transaction monitoring and in-house compliance staff with experience in AML.  While some people may see anonymous trading as a feature of the cryptocurrency market, it can also enable problematic business practices and criminal or terrorist activity. Coinfirm CEO Pawel Kuskowski told CoinDesk many such platforms require just a crypto wallet address to get started.  In the report, Coinfirm identified Binance as having a “high” regulatory risk based on “exposure to anonymous activity,” since deposits and withdrawals for values below 2 bitcoin (less than $8,000 as of press time) reportedly did not require KYC as of February 2019.  Overall, there were several exchanges – including Coinsquare, Coinbase, Gemini and the Circle-owned Poloniex – that Coinfirm’s Kuskowski identified as “low risk” due to official licenses and strict KYC/AML policies.  The broad spectrum of enforced compliance procedures wasn’t the most surprising part of this research for Kuskowski, however. It was the legal structure behind some platforms, including several of the industry’s most famous high-volume exchanges, which Kuskowski declined to name.  “It’s perceived as a UK entity, but it’s not really a UK entity,” he said as a hypothetical example. “In a lot of these situations, you would have the entity that is transmitting money, especially fiat, that was actually an entity between the contracting party and the sender.”  The finding follows another recent study byBitwise Asset Management, which claimed that almost95 percent of the widely reported bitcoin trading volume was actually an artifice, often involving automated bots or misreported statistics from unregulated exchanges.  “You don’t put any identifier like an email address. That’s how low it can be,” Kuskowski said of certain industry practices. “On the other hand, we have a video conference as part of the onboarding where someone is checking whether the documents you’re providing are in line with what you are holding in your hand.”  Issues with Binance  Throughout the research process, Coinfirm’s team also found that some exchanges failed to fully implement the official policies on their websites. For example, Binance users from restricted countries haveallegedly been able to use the platform simply by using a virtual private network (VPN) to obfuscate their location.  A New York-based CoinDesk employee was able to do small crypto-to-crypto transactions without KYC or VPN using Binance, while purchasing bitcoin with a credit card did appear to require KYC.  This harkens back to 2018, when Attorney General Barbara Underwood said Binance, Kraken, and Gate.io claimed they do not service customers in New York and as such her colleagues were unable to determine whether these platforms allowed ""manipulative or abusive trading,"" not to mention the trading of unregistered securities.  Regardless of how the KYC policy is actually enforced, it’s clear that Binance is taking steps to beef up its compliance procedures. On Tuesday, Binance announced a partnership with analytics firm IdentityMind to “improve existing data protection and compliance measures for Binance’s global operations.”  Binance's Chief Compliance Officer, Samuel Lim, denied this assertion that users can deposit and withdraw thousands of dollars worth of crypto without any KYC, although he failed to specify what Binance's KYC requirements are.  Instead, Lim told CoinDesk:  ""Where the industry currently stands, it is an ambitious, yet ongoing effort, to implement a unique KYC requirement to service all of our users and businesses. However, in every single jurisdiction that it operates in, Binance adheres to all local rules and regulations and has built trust among the public through its developments, services and values since its inception. For all of our regulated/licensed businesses, the standard followed is the model which is approved by the regulating body, including Jersey, Uganda, Malta and Singapore.""  Opaque jurisdictions  Still, Kuskowshi admits this jurisdictional maneuvering can make conclusions difficult.  Kuskowski said that many exchanges have separate legal entities that handle deposits, money transmission or payment processing in a distant jurisdiction where the regulations are lax or generally unclear.  “The parent [company] is operating the exchange but the money is transmitted through this entity,” he said, adding:  “If, for example, you lose your money and think it is a U.K. company and that you can have recourse for this money, if this entity is some dodgy jurisdiction and you don’t know who is the owner, it’s very difficult to have recourse.”  This type of structure may have prolonged the lawsuit against Bitcoin Market, filed in November 2018, because it is unclear whether Oklahoma, where the exchange owners reside, is the correct jurisdiction for this case.  On the other hand, Kuskowski said the diversified legal structure could be “legitimate,” even if it leaves a bad taste in his mouth not to disclose such legal structures to users. Coinfirm’s report actually had a silver lining. In 2019, more companies appear to offer clear disclosures and traditional KYC/AML policies than researchers originally found in February 2018.  “Financial institutions are looking for legitimate partners,” Kuskowski said. “We’ve seen a trend of more exchanges implementing these procedures in order to partner with these entities.”    Coinfirm Exchange Report Coindesk by CoinDesk on Scribd    Computer image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/27/most-crypto-exchanges-still-dont-have-clear-kyc-policies-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2f981a91865518c68b5f7761aa12cb3037daf34a-1500x1017.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced today, the new group at HBUS will be headed up by Katelyn Mew, a veteran of asset management powerhouse BlackRock and discount brokerage Charles Schwab, and Oren Blonstein, who comes from fintech provider Tora Trading Services.  ""We set up a new institutional sales and customer service group just to have some focus and resources on this segment of the market where we see a lot of the growth coming from,"" Blonstein told CoinDesk.  ""We’re entering the market now with a real institutional offering, we’re definitely going to be offering some new products and services,"" such as token lending and over-the-counter (OTC) trading, in the coming months, he added.  According to a press release, HBUS may even look at launching a stablecoin (though no details were provided).  In a statement, Mew, a vice president of sales and marketing at HBUS, said the company would offer ""sophisticated trading systems and a trusted marketplace.""  ""Unfortunately, the current landscape is significantly behind the traditional financial services industry. As more and more institutions integrate digital assets into their portfolios, they’ll need trusted, secure and compliant partners, such as Huobi.com,"" she added.  While Blonstein did not provide any names, he said some clients are already onboarding.  Licenses  Blonstein, a vice president of technology at HBUS, said one of his firm's main draws is its connection to traders outside the U.S. Its namesake company, based in Singapore, is the world's fourth-largest exchange by 24-hour volume (when adjusted to exclude distortive activities such as no-fee trading), according to CoinMarketCap.  ""If you’re a U.S.-based fund, so are now or in the future could be regulated by a U.S. regulator, it’s important that you’re working with another compliant institution,"" Blonstein said. ""So if you’re in the U.S. [but] if you want to access to liquidity outside the U.S. ... you need to do that through a U.S. platform.""  Based in San Francisco, HBUS has money transmission licenses in various states, with petitions out to those jurisdictions it still needs a license in. It is also registered as a money services business (MSB) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury.  At some point, HBUS will even seek a BitLicense through the New York Department of Financial Services.  HBUS' new group is the latest entrant to the crypto space to court institutional investors. In recent weeks, firms ranging from mutual fund heavyweight Fidelity to crypto-native startup LGO Markets have begun onboarding or talking to customers, while established firms like Seed CX continue to roll out new products.  UPDATE (March 28, 15:30 UTC): The headline and a passage in this have been updated to clarify the relationship between HBUS and Huobi. The U.S. operation is not a subsidiary of the Singapore company, it just licenses the name, according to Kaitlin Starcher, a spokesperson for the firm.

42402711,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcVh0,1553688055,New iPhone-Controlled Crypto Vault Promises 'Bank-Grade' Security,"Trustology, founded by technologists who previously worked at such banks as BNY Mellon, RBS and Barclays, has launched an iPhone-controlled crypto vault it claims is secure enough for financial institutions.  Announced Wednesday, the first version of TrustVault is available for download at the Apple UK App Store, and initially can be used to store ether, the cryptocurrency native to the ethereum public blockchain. Bitcoin and ERC-20 tokens that run on top of ethereum are to follow soon after.  Trustology closed an $8 million seed round late last year led by ethereum design studio ConsenSys and Two Sigma Ventures, a VC arm of tech-focused hedge fund Two Sigma Investments.  At first blush, TrustVault might look like another crypto wallet phone app. But there’s a lot going on behind the screen: a clever combination of hardware security modules (HSMs) operated by Trustology with verification processes distributed among individuals at secure data centers.  Spelling this out, Alex Batlin, Trustology’s founder and CEO told CoinDesk,  “It allows you the ease of a mobile phone, but really what we always talk about is a TrustVault account. If you mention the phone, people think it's just a phone app. But that’s a bit like saying my bank account is just the mobile bank app. It looks like a simple app, but the real power is in the service behind that.”  Indeed, like a bank, Trustology identifies its customers upfront, and if the phone is lost, the account can be recovered with the company since the private keys to the crypto wallet are not stored on the device.  Yet involvement of humans in certain parts of the setup process doesn’t mean this is a typical cold storage solution, which can take up to 48 hours to get assets out, Batlin said.  Once the user is on-boarded, TrustVault is almost entirely automated and takes a fraction of a second to move funds, he said, adding,  “The problem with the person scenario is you absolutely reduce cyberattack, but you now increase the physical attack. Because in the end, an individual is just a very slow network connection.”  HODL the phone  A slew of blockchain phones has hit the market of late, such as the Samsung Galaxy S10 or the HTC’s EXODUS 1 and Sirin Labs’ Finney – and they all offer some method of storing keys.  For example, Samsung's S10 touts what it calls “defense-grade Samsung Knox,” as well as storage backed by hardware and so on. But one suspects the goal for Samsung is ultimately the possibility of connecting to Samsung Pay in the future.  For now, TrustVault is only compatible with iPhone because historically it’s the only phone with an enclave secure enough for this type of custody service, Batlin said.  However, Android compatibility is coming soon, he said, in the form of the recently released Google Pixel 3 phone.  “It has something called a Titan M chip which is very secure, more secure than the iPhone. So we will be working on an Android version, but it won’t be for every device; it will only be for the more secure ones,” said Batlin.  The nuts and bolts  Trustology has tried to put everything in hardware. “We took the tried and tested HSMs, which is what banks have been using for SWIFT network and many other very highly secure systems, but we customized the firmware,” said Batlin.  When the app is launched, a cryptographic private key is created in the iPhone enclave, followed by bank-grade know-your-customer (KYC) process which ties the non-extractable key to the user’s identity. Note that this is not the same key that directly controls the user's funds.  The next step is to create a key account with TrustVault, a request which is signed by the private phone key. A private key is then created inside the HSM and a “policy file,"" which associates the key inside the phone with the one inside the HSM.  From there, the user’s public address becomes the equivalent of a bank account, said Batlin.  “To move money you have to be able to sign the transaction with the key inside your phone and send it to us. We then load the appropriate policy file and then only if that key is mapped to the key inside the HSM do we re-sign that transaction with the real key inside the HSM.”  In addition to the minimum viable product (MVP) being launched today, TrustVault is also being offered to financial institutions as a white-label service they can provide to their customers. Batlin said there is demand from top-tier and mid-tier banks.  There will be a range of business models going forward (the early adopter MVP comes at a simple flat £4.99 a month subscription) depending in part on insurance, which Trustology is in the process of arranging, he said.  Joseph Lubin, ConsenSys founder, described Trustology in a statement as “industrial grade security, but available to anyone” and added,  “When it comes to crypto wallets, hot is the new cold.”  Data center image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/27/new-iphone-controlled-crypto-vault-promises-bank-grade-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fc1192501a915d72c5180473c7488ac63038946-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402717,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcVjx,1553684700,Bitcoin Again Rebounds From Strong Price Support,"View  Bitcoin has again created a higher low along the 30-day moving average line, neutralizing Monday's bearish close below $3,920.  A move above $4,055 (March 21 high) is still needed to revive the short-term bullish setup. That could be followed by a rally to resistance levels lined up at $4,190–$4,236.  A UTC close below the 30-day moving average, currently at $3,889, would put the bears in a commanding position, opening the doors for a drop to support levels at $3,775 (March 14 low) and $3,658 (Feb. 27 low).  Bitcoin (BTC) has once more rebounded from the 30-day moving average, thwarting a bearish move that saw prices drop below $3,920 on Monday.  The move sees the crypto market leader return from uncertain ground 24 hours ago, having dived out of the $3,920-$4,055 trading range on Monday. That range breakdown coupled with the signs of bullish exhaustion on the longer duration charts had opened the doors for a deeper drop below the 30-day moving average (MA) at $3,883, as discussed yesterday.  The MA support, however, held ground despite the bearish setup, allowing BTC to climb back to $4,000. Essentially, the cryptocurrency has established a bullish higher low along the key average for the third time this month.  While the bearish case has weakened, the short-term bullish view put forward by the long-tailed doji created on Feb. 27 would only be revived if there is a strong follow through to the rebound from the 30-day MA support, preferably a break above the recent high of $4,055 hit on March 21.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $4,015 on Bitstamp, representing a 2.6 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. A high of $4,031 was clocked soon before press time.  Daily chart  As seen above, BTC has picked up a bid following the defense of the 30-day MA, currently at $3,889. The higher-low pattern would gain credence if the bounce ends up establishing a higher high above the March 21 high of $4,055.  That would expose the February high of $4,190, above which a major hurdle is seen at $4,236 – the bearish lower high created on Dec. 24.  On the downside, a UTC close below the 30-day MA is the target for the bears.  8-hour chart  On the 8-hour chart, BTC has breached the falling channel on the higher side and the breakout is backed by a bullish relative strength index (RSI) reading of 61.00.  So, prices may find acceptance above $4,040 in the next few hours. The bullish case, however, would weaken if the rising trendline hurdle proves a tough nut to crack.

A Financial Times report on Tuesday citing “people familiar with the effort” said that the LME has backed a consortium initiative led by commodity trading firm Mercuria, to build a blockchain-based system to track the trade of physical metals such as copper, zinc and aluminium.  The initiative, dubbed “Forcefield,” is also supported by banks such as Macquarie and ING, according to the report. The blockchain-based system aims to help buyers in the industry track the source of their metal, as well as help metal traders prove ownership of their stock.  LME chief executive Matt Chamberlain reportedly did not comment on any involvement in the initiative by the exchange specifically, but told the FT:  ""[In a blockchain-based system] you know where your metal is, you have proof of your metal, but nobody can see what your metal is and where your metal is.""  If the industry can unite to deliver such a system, it would be ""a huge win for the metals trading community,” he added.  The LME has 500 ""approved"" warehouses in 34 locations across the world, where it stores metals on behalf of holders, according to information on its website.  However, it has “no approved” warehouses in China, the world’s largest consumer of metals, according to the FT report, which makes it difficult for traders and consumers to be sure of metals' provenance, as well as the general state of supply and demand.  Back in 2016, the LME launched an electronic system called LMEshield for tracking material stored in China, though it reportedly hasn’t seen much success.

Between November 2014 and January 2018, McDonnell allegedly represented himself as an experienced cryptocurrency trader, promising customers that he would provide them with trading advice, as well as buy and trade cryptocurrency on their behalf. McDonnell is said to have used his Staten Island-based company, CabbageTech Crop., also known as Coin Drop Markets, to solicit investments through social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter.  However, neither McDonnell nor CabbageTech provided any investment services, according to the indictment. Instead, he sent investors “false"" balance statements indicating that their investments were profitable, and ""stole their money for his personal use."" When customers requested refunds, McDonnell allegedly first made excuses for delays in repayment and later stopped responding at all.  In total, McDonnell defrauded at least 10 victims of at least $194,000 in cash, 4.41 bitcoin (worth $17,500 at press time), 206 litecoin ($12,304), 620 ethereum classic ($2,914) and 1,342,634 verge ($9,965), according to the indictment.  “The defendant’s fraud ends now, he will be held responsible for his criminal conduct,” said Richard P. Donoghue, attorney for the Eastern District of New York. If proven guilty and convicted, McDonnell faces a jail term of a maximum 20 years.  McDonnell was previously sued by the U.S. derivatives regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), in January 2018 for absconding with customers’ crypto assets.  Later in July, the CFTC wrapped up the case against McDonnell and was seeking a permanent injunction against him. McDonnell at the time gave up the fight saying he did not have the resources or the ability to continue contesting the charges brought against him.  “For the sake of pure minute-to-minute survival, I must continue to be removed from proceeding,"" he said.  In the same case, the presiding district judge notably backed the CFTC in defining cryptocurrencies as commodities. At issue was whether the commission had the authority to regulate cryptocurrency as a commodity in the absence of federal level rules, and whether the law permitted the CFTC to exercise its jurisdiction in the matter.
