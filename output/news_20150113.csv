42398135,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWPT,1421186435,Bitcoin Trading Slump Blamed in Delta Financial Service Cut,"Delta Financial has revealed that it will “cease current services” on 30th January, including its notable interest-bearing bitcoin account and trading products.  Customer funds held in such accounts will stop generating interest, effective immediately, the Hong Kong and Vancouver-based company said in a post on its website. Users will also no longer be able to sell bitcoin through the platform.  Perhaps most notably for the broader bitcoin community, Delta Financial cited the current lackluster performance of the market as the reason for the service changes.  Delta wrote:  ”Simply put, the financial products we wanted to build on the bitcoin platform simply require a bigger trading volume than that what exists today.”  Delta ended its message by voicing its long-term support for bitcoin and its wider community, saying it is looking forward to watching the continued growth of the ecosystem. It is not immediately clear how the company will seek to move forward to new services, or in which markets it will now operate.  Delta Financial first announced the feature in June, guaranteeing a 5% minimum interest rate to customers by lending customer bitcoins to users of its margin trading platform.  Customer assurances  Delta encouraged users to submit withdrawal requests for money still on the platform as soon as possible, but said it would make “reasonable best efforts” to return all funds.  Users with more than $1,000 on the site were instructed to contact the company by email to retrieve their money, all of which, the company said, is in safe keeping.  “To be clear, all user funds on our system are properly accounted for, and this closure is not the result of any security-related issues,” Delta said.  The news notably comes amid a flurry of bearish news for the bitcoin industry, with CEX.io closing its cloud mining offering due to unprofitability yesterday.  CoinDesk has reached out to Delta officials, but has not received an immediate response. A phone number previously used by the company is no longer in service.

42398131,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWMW,1421185604,Silk Road Trial Begins in New York,"Alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht’s trial began this morning in a New York City courtroom, where he faces life in prison for accusations that he managed and operated the now-infamous online black market under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts.  Ulbricht entered the courtroom in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York at 09:20 local time with his legal team led by attorney Joshua Dratel by his side. He faces four narcotics charges and three charges related to computer hacking, trafficking fraudulent identification documents and money laundering conspiracy, respectively.  Many following Ulbricht’s trial see it as a benchmark case that will set precedents for online crime and privacy on the Internet. Another vital part of the Silk Road story is bitcoin, the sole form of payment that was used on the illicit website.  The government seized 144,336 bitcoins worth more than $39m at today’s price from Ulbricht’s laptop when he was arrested in a public library in October 2013. Nearly 80,000 of these bitcoins have since been auctioned off by US Marshals.  Setting the stage  Judge Katherine Forrest began the day by welcoming the room filled with lawyers, press and Ulbricht's family, announcing that jury selection would be the first item of the agenda.  Potential jurors were brought into the courtroom at 10:30. Judge Forrest detailed some of the procedures ahead and also provided relevant background information about the case. She then selected the first group of potential jurors for questioning in the jury box.  Before reading off Ulbricht's seven charges from his indictment, Forrest explicitly stated to the jurors that an indictment is just an accusation of crime, and not proof of the crime itself – Ulbricht nodded in agreement as Forrest explained that the defendant is ""innocent until proven guilty"" by the US government.  Jury selection  Judge Forrest made specific reference to bitcoin when reading off Ulbricht's money laundering conspiracy charge.  After mentioning that bitcoin was the payment method used on the Silk Road, Forrest told the potential jurors that Ulbricht's charges allege that he ""designed the Silk Road's payment system to conceal the website's activity from the government"".  A number of questions were then asked to jurors to assess whether they could make unbiased decisions about the trial. Judge Forrest asked Ulbricht – who was wearing a suit and tie – to identify himself by standing and then asked the group of 16 potential jurors whether they had any bias against him. Nobody spoke up.  The judge also acknowledged that this trial has already attracted protestors outside of the courthouse, and that it will likely be receiving attention in the media throughout its duration.  Opening statements  A final jury was selected in the afternoon and opening statements were then made both by the prosecution and the defense.  Dratel's opening statement revealed a new narrative to the defense team's strategy of proving that Ulbricht is not guilty on all seven counts. The defense attorney admitted that Ulbricht is the creator of the Silk Road, but that he ultimately passed along the responsibility of running the site to the ""real"" Dread Pirate Roberts, only to be left framed once that person realized law enforcement was closing in.  On the prosecuting end, attorney Timothy Howard's opening statement reiterated that the government planned to prove that Ulbricht was actively involved as the mastermind behind all of Silk Road's operations. Howard also referenced one of Ulbricht's college friends that will be called to the witness stand to testify about Ulbricht allegedly bragging to him about running the website.  A long road ahead  Forrest explained to the room that the entire trial will likely last four to six weeks and cautioned jurors not to do any outside research or pay attention to media reports in that time. Outside of the courtroom, though, the ripple effects of the original Silk Road are still being felt.  Earlier this week, a spawn of the original online black market, Silk Road Reloaded, made news by migrating from operating on the Tor network to the anonymous, decentralized I2P network.  With Ulbricht's arrest and multiple shutdowns of online dark markets including the Silk Road and Silk Road 2.0, the US government has made clear that cybercrime of this nature is high on its priority list.  As Ulbricht's trial progresses and black markets continue to proliferate on the Internet, the implications of the first Silk Road will become even more clear for all to see.

42398139,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWSQ,1421181941,German Startup Gives Away 3D-Printed Bitcoin Payment Terminals,"By combining hacked cellphones and 3D-printed casings, a startup based in Hannover, Germany, has developed a working bitcoin point-of-sale (POS) terminal called PEY.  The PEY terminal is being offered for free to local merchants to encourage the use of bitcoin as a means of payment, while bypassing the high fees imposed on German traders by credit and debit card companies.  PEY  has also created its own wallet app for iOS and Android to work in conjunction with the terminals. The app, which has been downloaded 150 times in the last month, is available worldwide (except China) but as it works alongside the terminal it is only fully functional in Germany.  The terminal software processes payments via payments processor BitPay, which immediately converts bitcoin into fiat currency to address merchants' concerns about price volatility.  'No brainer' for merchants  Ricardo Ferrer Rivero, creator of the terminal, said he was prompted to create the device after noticing the lack of low-cost bitcoin payment solutions available in the country.  ""It's a no-brainer,"" he said. ""If you offer a merchant the possibility to accept payments without a fee and still have the benefits of electronic payments without using cash, it would be hard for them to say no.""  Although initially met with varying levels of scepticism, the project has grown in popularity. A total of 50 establishments have already agreed to accept bitcoin using the PEY terminal and a dozen retailers already have their own terminals up and running in store.  Plans to charge for the service are on hold until information surfaces about the service's in-market performance.  When asked about his business plan, Rivero said that ""bitcoin payments do not currently make up a large part of the shop's revenue so we will have to wait for the market to develop before we assess how to proceed"".  How it works  The terminal integrates secondhand Google Nexus 7 mobile phones with a 3D-printed case that can easily be placed on a merchant's counter.  PEY uses iBeacon technology so that users who have the app installed on their Android phone or iPhone will receive a push notification informing them that a local retailer accepts bitcoin payments. As the PEY app communicates directly with the PEY terminal, users are spared from having to search through various pages of apps to find their bitcoin wallet.  The app uses NFC (Near Field Communication) to transmit the information if their phone offers that technology. Alternatively, users can simply scan the QR code generated by BitPay in order to complete the transaction.  Users without the PEY app can use the QR code to pay via any other mobile wallet.  The prototype version of the PEY terminal is currently based on Android phone, but Rivero hopes to be able to replace it with a Raspberry Pi in the upcoming version.  Although current adoption figures indicate a reasonable amount of success, Rivero insists that improving the app is an ongoing project and that new features are due to appear in the near future.  He said:  ""We are including a map of all [merchant] locations and are working on streamlining the invoicing process so that it can be paperless.""  Bitcoin schemes on the rise  Although it is a pioneering service in Germany, PEY's launch comes after a series of similar local schemes launched in the Netherlands and United States.  Amsterdam-based BitStraat and BitPay teamed up last November to give away free 100 bitcoin payment terminals across the Dutch capital city.  And in the San Francisco area, bitcoin payment solutions provider snapCard launched its ""#IntegrateSF"" campaign among 500 merchants in October.  ""We love to see our users come up with innovative ways to use our technology.""said Wouter Vonk, BitPay European marketing manager of Rivero's offering. ""Local initiatives like PEY in Hannover can always count on our full support.""

42398132,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWNV,1421177738,"Bitstamp Back Online, But Did Bitcoin Traders Return?","Following the 5th January announcement that it was suffering a “hot wallet issue” later determined to be the work of malicious actors, Bitstamp spent much of the last week offline, temporarily closing what had been among the top three exchanges for BTC/USD trading.  The unexpected news set off a flurry of concerns that, less than one year after the demise of then-leading USD/BTC exchange Mt Gox, history could be repeating itself, and that Bitstamp may be the latest bitcoin exchange to close its doors due to a high-profile hack.  By 9th January, however, Bitstamp indicated it would resume services, promising it was back and better than ever. The exchange initiated trading in the global markets at 21:00 UTC, boasting multisig security, a new back-end cloud infrastructure and commission-free trading.  Indeed, the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index showed that Bitstamp’s 19:40 UTC announcement that it would resume services caused a spike in the market, with the price of bitcoin rising from $285.66 to a high of $290.71 on the BPI before declining.  But, while Bitstamp is back online, questions still remain regarding whether Bitstamp can win back traders and regain its former market position.  A step off pace  Though rival exchanges ANXBTC, Bitfinex and BTC-e all saw notable increases in weekly volume, data from Bitcoinity indicates that Bitstamp has mostly regained its former position in the BTC/USD market.  BTC/USD exchange trading volume over the last seven days:  After resuming services, Bitstamp quickly overtook LakeBTC and BTC-e in terms of daily trading volume. It now trails market leaders Bitfinex and OKCoin.  Data from a six-month timeframe reveals that Bitstamp has fallen to third-place on the BTC/USD leaderboard from its second-placed position before the hack.  However, other data illustrates that Bitstamp volume growth had slowed when compared to Bitfinex and OKCoin, even before the incident.  BTC/USD exchange trading volume over the last six months:    Still, not all observers were impressed by the figures. Alistair Milne, portfolio manager at Altana Digital Currency Fund, for instance, expressed his opinion that the volume figures are weak considering Bitstamp’s decision to cut fees.  “In zero-fee mode, you'd hope for better,” Milne told CoinDesk.  Trading volume recovers  While Bitstamp may have lost momentum due to the hack, volume figures suggest that the exchange has mostly recovered in terms of daily business. Bitstamp’s current daily figures are actually higher than its six-month daily average prior to last week’s hack.  However it’s worth noting that these figures may not be indicative of a customer response to the exchange, as its relaunch has coincided with a period of unusually high volatility in the price of bitcoin, resulting in larger trading volumes than normal.  The following chart was taken using figures from 10th to 12th January, omitting today’s data, showing the unusually high volume observed across exchanges.  Bitstamp’s 180-day average compared to 3-day average:    Still, some traders reported a difference in the level of service the exchange is providing. Milne noted that he has seen fewer larger buy and sell orders on the exchange.  “As we trade very frequently for the fund, I can say with some certainty that it is harder to trade large amounts on Bitstamp, at least for now,” he said.  Potential business impact  While the hack did not seem to have a measurable effect on Bitstamp’s volume, some market observers expressed their concern about long-term impact the situation and its perception could have on the company.  Economist and investor Tuur Demeester suggested, using Bitstamp’s last audit as a basis, that one could estimate that the hot wallet breach accounted for roughly 9% of the exchange’s total bitcoin holdings. However, he noted that Bitstamp’s last published audit was made public on 24th May, and as such, this figure is only a best estimate.  Milne, too, has been vocal about his belief that Bitstamp’s total reserves may have been reduced by the incident.  Yet another interpretation posed by Demeester put the company’s loss of customer funds in context of its potential 2014 earnings.  Assuming the exchange traded 4.98m BTC in 2014 at a per trade fee of 0.3%–0.5%, Demeester theorized that Bitstamp’s projected profit could be between 14,950 BTC–25,000 BTC.  “In other words, for Bitstamp to replenish the lost reserves of its customers, it may have to spend as much as an entire year's worth of income,” Demeester said.  Perhaps most troubling to market observers may be the observations of Crypto Currency Fund chairman Tim Enneking, who asserts that an analysis of Bitstamp’s order books suggest certain traders were aware of issues at the exchange prior to the official news.  Enneking added his fund would likely stop trading on the exchange in light of this opinion.  Wake up call  Overall, market observers also differed on any lasting impact that the outage will have on the wider bitcoin market.  Demeester voiced his opinion that the roughly 19,000 BTC stolen in the breach won’t be easily replenished by the company, and that it will have a measurable influence on its ability to satisfy audits, thereby providing the market with transparency.  Enneking seemed less convinced that Bitstamp would be hampered by the outage, arguing that the effects may color market perception for several months before fading.  “It will take a little while for Bitstamp to occupy its old status,” he concluded.  Perhaps the most vocal company on how Bitstamp will affect the larger market has been multisig security provider BitGo. Bitstamp announced on 9th January that it would use BitGo’s multisig wallet product to secure hot wallet funds, replacing its own technology.    Number of lines of code @Bitstamp had to change to integrate with @BitGo multi-sig wallet: ONE. More details soon.      — Ben Davenport (@bendavenport) January 9, 2015      Speaking to CoinDesk, BitGo CEO Will O’Brien indicated that that representatives of both companies met in San Francisco and quickly got in the ""war room"" as part of the wider effort to bring the exchange back online.  “I think that the response that Bitstamp had to address the issues right away, to tell its customers that it was going to reimburse any losses and then embrace the best of breed technology and security platform really speaks to their credit,” he said.  However, O’Brien concluded that the event should be a “wake up call” to the entire exchange industry, which he categorized as slow to integrate services that could potentially mitigate such attacks.  “I think every exchange that is using single key is at risk,” he concluded.

42398136,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWQS,1421166372,New Bitcoin Embassies in Asia Bring World Total to 17,"Two new Asian 'bitcoin embassies' opened last week in Seoul and Tokyo, with a shared mission to bring bitcoin's message to a more general audience.  There are now 17 such advocacy centres worldwide, in all major regions except Africa. However, the organization behind the movement is currently in negotiations to set up embassies both there and in the Middle East.  Gangnam style  The Seoul centre is based at the Startup Alliance co-working space in trendy Gangnam.  Dongho 'Saddo' Park and Junyoung Park, both local software engineers and cryptocurrency fans, are the primary organizers of the embassy.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Dongho Park explained that many in mainstream Korean society still misunderstand bitcoin and blockchain technology. His mission, he said, is to educate them and enable more people to use the digital currency.  He said:  ""Seoul is one of the most trend-leading cities in the world. But many people in Korea see bitcoin as just an old-fashioned cyber currency or some kind of mileage [scheme]. And some people even think that it's another type of fraud.""  Park hopes people will stop focusing on bitcoin's value, and think of it as something other than a money-making investment.  Instead, they should focus on bitcoin as a currency and buy it to gain financial freedom, he said. He added that, while it isn't ready to replace fiat currencies just yet, bitcoin's underlying technology has proven to be safe for six years now.  Not just for geeks  Tokyo's Embassy  , which opened on 5th January, is located at the Travelers Coworking space near Shinjuku train station – Japan's busiest.  Organizer Atsushi Ogisawa, who has run the coworking space for the past two years, explained that the embassy will hold seminars especially for beginners interested in bitcoin, and provide facilities for freelancers and small startups.  ""Although Japan is one of the most technologically developed countries, I think most Japanese people are not so positive about bitcoin and other virtual currencies, and it looks like only geeks gather at some meetups in Tokyo,"" he said.  This scenario is probably due to past problems like Mt Gox, Ogisawa added, saying he wished to ""fill the gap between beginners and experts"".  He advised that new users should not be afraid of the technology, and that anyone who used bitcoin or other virtual currencies in real life would quickly and easily understand its possibilities.  The embassy movement  The Bitcoin Embassy Global Network website says the name ""bitcoin embassy"" refers to endorsed global locations where enthusiasts and the general public alike can come together to learn more about cryptocurrencies.  The name ""bitcoin embassy"" and its logo are trademarked to prevent misuse, according to the group. However, although they share a name and official endorsement, each embassy operates independently.  The first three embassies opened in Montreal, Tel Aviv and Warsaw in late 2013/early 2014, and their number has since grown to 17 recognized bitcoin centers worldwide.  Mission to educate  Bruno Timpano, the 'ambassador' for the Bitcoin Embassy in Australia, said the embassies act like 'bitcoin colleges' for workshops and education.  He said:  ""We aim to give bitcoin a physical space where the community can come for free and be educated, make a wallet, see mining equipment, and talk to other industry stakeholders.""  While the movement is not about subversive projects, it is also not about pushing for KYC regulations or joining foundations, Timpano explained.  He said, however, that it is imperative for bitcoin's message to stay focused on its potential for positive impact on the world, and away from the mass-media mindset that it is ""shadowy software"" that is used mainly for illegal activities.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/13/new-bitcoin-embassies-in-asia-bring-world-total-to-17,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca89e596841b9431944a9f26eeb0bd162211e7f2-1818x884.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398122,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWEe,1421159413,Russia's Media Watchdog Blocks Bitcoin Websites,"Update (13th January 17:00 GMT): CCFR has informed us that more bitcoin sites were blacklisted, including three .ru domains – coinspot.ru, hasbitcoin.ru and bitcoinconf.ru.      Russia’s media watchdog has blocked access to a number of bitcoin-related sites, citing a court order from 30th September.  The Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor) allows visitors to check whether or not a site is blacklisted. At press time, Bitcoin.org, Bitcoin.it, BTCsec.com and bitcoin exchange Indacoin were blacklisted.  According to TJournal.ru, Roskomnadzor cited a ruling of the district court of the city of Nevyansk, Sverdlovsk region, as the reason for the ban. The details behind the ruling and subsequent blacklisting remain unclear.  Crypto Currencies Foundation of Russia (CCFR) chairman Igor Chepkasov told CoinDesk the ruling is part of a much wider clampdown:  ""Given the remoteness of the region and the features of the ruling's execution, a court decision issued on September 30th and in the register of blocked sites as of 13th January, we can safely say that this is a dress rehearsal for the prohibition of bitcoin in Russia.""  Blacklisted sites  Three of the sites CoinDesk found to be blocked are resource sites – bitcoin.org is a community website sponsored by the Bitcoin Foundation, bitcoin.it is a Wiki project on bitcoin, while btcsec.com is a Russian bitcoin community site, with news, discussion forums and other resources.  Chepkasov said none of the owners of the sites received any punitive statements and notifications, or official correspondence from the government and regulatory agencies official letters (including a list of of claims and recommendations about their elimination).  He called on enthusiasts to fight against such measures:  ""Now that bitcoin enthusiasts and entrepreneurs are faced with real restrictions, we can see how the Russian bitcoin community is organised and whether it is ready to fight for its rights. On behalf of the CCFR, I urge all enthusiasts to unite and fight for their rights. I appeal to the victims and notify you that we are ready to provide them with all possible support – consulting, legal and other.""  Roskomnadzor’s controversial policies  Roskomnadzor’s Internet blacklist came into effect in late 2012, after Russian lawmakers passed legislation allowing the agency to blacklist websites without a trial. At the time, the authorities said the blacklist would be used to protect minors from websites featuring sexual abuse of children, encouraging drug use, solicit children for pornography or advocate suicide.  However, it soon became apparent that the blacklist was used for more than the original law suggested. A number of Wikipedia articles have been blacklisted, along with certain GitHub pages, Facebook pages and other websites dealing with politically sensitive topics.  Last August, just weeks before the court ruling which led to the blacklisting, the Russian Ministry of Finance drafted a law banning bitcoin. Ministry officials later announced that Russia would pass the digital currency ban in the spring of 2015. However, in late December the country’s Ministry of Economic Development criticised the bill over its perceived vagueness and potential to harm retailers.

42398126,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWGc,1421155155,How Credit Card Fraud Sank One Bitcoin Exchange,"One of the biggest problems for bitcoin exchanges and their customers is often making the exchange quick and easy. Exchanges like Canadian firm Virtex made the decision a long time ago not to accept credit cards. Their biggest concern? Fraud, in the form of chargebacks.  In a credit card chargeback, a credit-card paying customer asks the issuing bank (the bank that gave them the card) to reverse a transaction made with a merchant.  This can happen for a variety of legitimate reasons. A merchant may not have delivered the promised goods or service, or it may have been faulty. In some cases, a card may have been stolen and used without the owner’s consent.  Sometimes, however, the owner of the card perpetrates their own fraud, by trying to reverse a legitimate financial transaction. It’s effectively a pre-blockchain version of double spending. This can happen a lot on the Internet, where companies are dealing with large numbers of unknown customers half a world away.  Chargeback target  This happened to Joey Rich, who found himself at the wrong end of a steep learning curve in 2010.  Having purchased some coins, he began selling them at a profit. He lost his initial investment of $9,000, though, after his bitcoin exchange, BuyBitcoins.com, suffered a series of chargebacks from stolen credit cards.  He explained that a combination of lost credit card revenues and chargeback fees led to a loss of his funds.  Rich said:  “For chargebacks, credit card companies charge fees of $25 to $35 in addition to the reversal of the original payment as a deterrent. So I also got hit with a huge number of those $35 fees, which is especially painful on orders of $5 to $10. As my my bank account went into the red, I started getting hit with overdraft fees as well, so it was quite a fiasco.”  Aside from the lost revenues, one of the nasty side effects of chargebacks is that credit card processors keep score. Too many chargebacks raises flags against your account. Eventually, his account was terminated, and Rich was added to a blacklist.  “I didn't really know anything about credit card processing back then, and didn't understand how reversible those payments are,” he admitted.  To make matters worse, he explained that the credit card processor hadn’t deposited the original $9,000 into his account in the first place, due to an administrative error. That didn’t stop them withdrawing $7,000 in chargeback transactions and fees, though, putting him in deficit and incurring even more charges in the form of overdraft fees.  It took him a year to sort it out and limp away with some money. In the interim, he had closed the exchange down while he figured out a way to handle credit cards more effectively.  In 2012, Rich reopened the site, this time with identity verification features, including options for users to upload a scan of their driver's license, to log in with their Facebook account, and to be geolocated using HTML5 in the browser (which he claimed is far better than geolocation by IP address).  Successful completion of all these tasks contributed to a trust score, which would help to decide whether a user’s order was processed or not.  At this point, Rich was using a different credit card processor.  He said:  “Those identity verification requirements helped me to do much better, and I reached about $45,000 in sales in the month of May 2013. However, about $4,500 of those were charged back, resulting in the termination of that account.”  The chargeback minefield  Clearly, credit card processing for merchants is harder than it looks. The rewards are ease and convenience, though, and depending on the customer demographic, are simply too tempting for some exchanges to resist.  CEX.io  will happily take your credit card payments in exchange for bitcoin, confirms CIO Jeffrey Smith.  “Credit card transactions are the fastest and most popular mean of payment. In order to go mainstream, an exchange has to have a credit or debit card deposit/withdraw option, among other payment methods,” he said.  The processing fees for credit cards makes them financially suitable for transactions up to $1,000, Smith indicated. After that, other mechanisms may be preferable. Wire bank transfers are good for larger amounts, but the process may take up to 10 days, he said, making it less than ideal for shorter-term investments.  Smith claims that the firm has lost no money at all on chargebacks. “We avoid chargebacks by working only with the credit or debit card providers who use 3D Secure. This layer of security enables us to reduce risks of chargebacks,” he explained.  3D Secure, which readers may know as 'Verified by Visa' or MasterCard SecureCode, requires a form of identification by the issuer, in addition to the merchant.  Alternative methods  Others are less trusting. One exchange CEO, who preferred not to be named, said that his demographic made it acceptable not to accept credit cards.  “When you’re dealing solely with SWIFT wire transfers, as we do right now, one of the biggest benefits is that they’re irreversible. Fraud isn’t one of our worries. Something like that is more attractive to a more B2B business-focused exchange like us.”  Burned by his credit card experiences, Rich now has another method of taking payments for bitcoin: PayPal. Customers paying via that service are now sent ‘bitcoin gift cards’, which are effectively paper wallets that he sends out by mail.  He said:  “I left the identity verification features in, but made them less important, since security lies mainly in physical delivery of the cards. I have been accepting an average of around $3,000 in sales per month, and have not lost any money to chargebacks yet. However, I refund quite a few payments that either look suspicious or are delivered to an address where they are never redeemed.”  Rich delivers the service, started in August 2014, through his BitcoinGiftCard.org site. The PayPal service costs about 4% in fees, which is ""irritating"", he said, as it’s higher than those asked by the credit card companies.  Passing on the risk  Another site, Brawker, has an ingenious solution for avoiding chargeback fraud: let conventional ecommerce players deal with it. Cyril Houri, who founded the site a few months ago, explained that it matches people wanting to buy bitcoin with those wanting to spend their bitcoin through non-bitcoin merchants online (see CoinDesk's review of the service here).  If Bob wants to buy a $200 DVD player from Amazon, but wants to pay for it in bitcoin, then he can publish that fact on Brawker. If Alice wants to buy $200-worth of bitcoin, she can bid for that order. If her bid is accepted, she then buys the goods in fiat currency, giving Bob’s address. Bob then sends the bitcoin to Alice after she sends him proof of purchase.  It’s effectively an exchange order book built atop online sales of other products.  The upside of this model is that the ecommerce provider handles any chargeback issues. If Alice decides to declare a chargeback on the DVD player, that’ll be Amazon’s problem (or Best Buy’s, or John Lewis’s, or whichever merchant is being used).  Houri’s company doesn’t even have a credit card merchant account. It has a bank account to pay expenses, but that’s it.  “You have the benefit of using the ecommerce infrastructure,” he said, arguing that the delivery of physical goods via ecommerce is often faster online than sending money via traditional methods. “Being able to piggyback on that makes it as convenient as possible.”  There is some inconvenience, though. Alice can only buy bitcoins in the quantity that Bob – or anyone else on the other side of the order book – wants to spend them. That makes it hard to buy exactly the number of bitcoins that she wants.  Houri said:  “With traditional exchanges, the commodity at the other end is fungible. In our case the commodity is a physical good. It’s someone who wanted to buy a hat, and in the other end it’s someone that is prepared to buy that hat’s value in bitcoin.”  Even Brawker is exploring stronger client verification, though. After all, any form of taking Internet payments is an exercise in risk. The more than you can decrease the risk, the better.  Credit cards may have their advantages when it comes to bitcoin purchases, but they also have their drawbacks. What’s interesting is how entrepreneurs try to route their way around them. On the Internet, it’s innovation that abhors a vacuum.

42398138,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWTP,1421151322,Bitcoin Price Crashes Through $250 Mark,"The bitcoin price has plunged below $250 and appears to be falling further, as sell orders pile up at major exchanges.  The price opened the day at $267.08, but quickly fell after just two hours of trading. Soon after 3am (GMT), the price plunged through the $250 mark, which market watchers see as an important psychological barrier for the price.  The price held steady, but then plunged again about seven hours later, at around 10am. The price then fell about $14 to fall under the $230 mark, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. At press time, it stood at $226.  Market-watchers have previously warned that if the price falls below $250, then further losses could be in the offing.  Arthur Hayes of derivatives firm BitMEX, writing in his weekly trading newsletter yesterday, offered that $200 was the next resistance level after $250.  ""If you were hoping for a violent rebound, that hasn't happened and it is time to move net-short [BTC],"" Hayes wrote.  Order books showing large sell orders  Order books at the major USD/BTC exchanges today are showing a spike in volume, largely from sell orders.  Bitfinex, the largest USD exchange by trading volume, shows sells dominating the order bookhttp://bfxdata.com/orderbooks/btcusd.php, comprising 70% of total volume over the past hour, at 10:55am. Sell orders have comprised 64% of the Bitfinex order book over the last 24 hours. Short swapshttp://bfxdata.com/sentiment/longshort.php  on Bitfinex have also spiked several times today, hitting a high of 70.5% of the active hourly swaps at around 2am. Current hourly swap activity is in favour of longs, which account for 74% of the instrument.  At recently revived Bitstamp, which had been offline for four days following a security breach and theft of $5m, selling pressure is piling up. The depth chart it offers shows a sharp increase in the quantity of sell orders of around 1,000 coins around the $244 mark. Hundreds of coins are joining the queue at current prices of around $231.  OKCoin, usually behind Bitfinex and Bitstamp in the amount of bitcoin-dollar trade done, is reporting consistent selling pressure. The price fell about $4 over 45 minutes, with 1,556 coins changing hands from 10am.  As bitcoin investors on the US east coast start their day to a sea of red candlesticks and a price that has lost more than $30 overnight, a further cascade of selling pressure may hit exchange order books.  Miners pull the plug  The plummeting price of bitcoin has had ripple effects throughout the bitcoin economy. While traders may be scrambling to top-up their margin accounts or to pile on the short swaps, some miners are apparently beginning to find their positions untenable as well.  Cloud mining outfit CEX.io, for one, said it would temporarily suspend mining because the price had fallen too low. Mining difficulty, meanwhile, has plateaued and dipped over the past 30 days, but remains at an all-time high.  ""[This is] the result of cloud mining costs exceeding mining profit,"" CEX.io chief information officer Jeffrey Smith wrote in a blog post announcing the suspension yesterday.  So how far more does the bitcoin price have to drop? As yesterday's Markets Weekly noted, several observers think it could go well below $200, after it has plunged past $250.  Martin Tillier of the Nasdaq's trading blog believes bitcoin's fair value lies somewhere in the $140 region, at a slight premium to the level it was trading at, around $120, before the bull-run in the autumn of 2013.  Meanwhile, bitcoin believers looking at a bitcoin price apparently in free-fall, might be left to reassure themselves that it's the underlying technology, not just the currency price, that matters most.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/13/bitcoin-price-crashes-through-250-mark,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6fd81452d000ebf0cf9ec3a797852d903d69fe95-900x500.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398130,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWLX,1421147916,Bitreserve Raises $9.6 Million in Crowdfunding Campaign,"UPDATE (14 January 2015 13:00 BST): Article has been updated to reflect crowdfunding breakdown.      Bitreserve has closed its crowdfunding campaign after raising over $9m.    The final total of $9,620,802 (£6,363,024) was reached after 157 investors bought 11.27% of the equity offered. Crowdcube investors raised $739,219 (£489,744) whilst the remaining $8,911,645 (£5,873,280) was contributed by a combination of Venovate and institutional investors. The crowdfunding activity on Venovate amounted to $126,000 (£83,020) whilst the remaining balance of $8.7m (£5.7m) came from institutional investors.    Tim Parsa, Bitreserve's president of global strategy and markets said:  ""It's been a real pleasure interacting with the savvy Crowdcube and Venovate investor. Raising venture capital has been secretive and elitist for far too long. We share Crowdcube and Venovate's commitment to transparency and inclusiveness.""  He went on to say he is proud to welcome so many new investors to the ""Bitreserve family"".  Twin platforms  The company had decided to list its equity offering on two separate platforms in a bid to ease the investment process for its members.  Crowdcube  was used by UK-based members, while Venovatehttp://welcome.venovate.com/ was the chosen platform for those who qualified as 'accredited' under US securities law.    The bitcoin storage platform has confirmed that its capital injection will be used to expand its engineering team, increase corporate hiring and support its international expansion.    'Medieval' system  While promoting its transparency features, including live accounting of its assets and obligations to its users, Bitreserve said that the opportunity to invest in the company ""should not be limited to a few wealthy individuals or well-connected venture capital funds"".  In an earlier interview with CoinDesk, Bitreserve founder and CEO Halsey Minor explained that the company's decision to finance through crowdfunding platforms was a ""supplement"" to other fundraising efforts.  ""It is also an attempt to address the limited investment opportunities available to the general public for technology companies like this,"" he said. ""People should have a right to invest in innovation. There are so many things that are just fundamentally flawed. It's like the finance system is still medieval"".",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/13/bitreserve-raises-96-million-in-crowdfunding-campaign,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5824e9c710ffcd626584740b9634c25a7a8a597-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
