The bearish sentiment across the space is among the most prominent in years — potentially more bearish than the 2018 bear market. Here is why the recent correction has felt far more painful than even Black Thursday, despite BTCUSD trading at roughly the same price as one year ago. Bearish Bitcoin Sentiment Could Be Blind To Bull Market You might not know it by the current price action, sentiment, or even economic backdrop, but there is a strong chance that Bitcoin is still in a bull market. The ongoing sideways consolidation phase could ultimately result in another, unexpected thrust upward, according to Bitcoin market structure mimicking an Elliott Wave Theory motive wave.

It attained an all-time high price of $22.89 on April 29th, 2018 according to CoinMarketCap. Many hoped that it would have given a better yield since most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and XRP that are within the top five cryptocurrencies at that time were experiencing a correction. However, the present record shows that EOS is the worst performer among the cryptocurrencies above. This has led to the question if EOS is worth hodling considering that every investor has profit as their aim? To answer this question, we shall consider the following: 1) EOS performance in relation to Bitcoin and Ethereum According to data available in CoinGecko, in the past 1 year, the price of EOS has reduced by 63.4%. Bitcoin price has also reduced by 26.5% while Ethereum price has increased by 37.8%. It could be seen that a crypto investor who hodls Bitcoin would have minimized his losses while an Ethereum investment would have made the Investor gain $37.8 for every $100 ETH holding. 2) Activities in the Blockchain According to the official EOS website EOS.io, it will be noted that the last active event in the blockchain was conducted over a year ago. This inactivity shows that the team might not have any new development or upgrade to conduct.

The Canadian-born TV personality is one of the richest businessmen in the world, and has an estimated net worth of $400 million.  O'Leary, his back against a palm tree-lined green screen, joined CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Earth Day to discuss his support of bitcoin mining amid concerns of climate change and why he thinks fellow corporate environmentalist Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk should run Twitter (TWTR).  Go green or go bust  In the past, O’Leary has criticized bitcoin mining, suggesting that companies should move to segregate ""clean"" BTC from dirty bitcoin mined using carbon-intensive processes.  Bitcoin miners use an estimated 2,260 kilowatt-hours to mine every bitcoin, according to database company Statista.  Read more: US House Democrats Call for Scrutiny on Crypto Mining as Environmental Threat  This process of separating “clean” bitcoin from “dirty” bitcoin may break bitcoin’s fungibility, experts have said, but could motivate certain investors who would otherwise enter the crypto industry but have made other ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) commitments to consider bitcoin, O’Leary said.  O’Leary said nuclear and hydro power will likely loom larger in the crypto-mining energy mix. Many new power plants have come on line in the U.S. this past year, largely in Texas, Oklahoma, upstate New York and the Pacific Northwest, drawing on renewable and nonrenewable energy sources.  Like other crypto-minded businessmen, O’Leary suggested that the energy-intensive proof-of-work algorithm used to mine bitcoin could drive wider adoption of green energy. Bitcoin, he said, “could bring capital to work there, build data centers for all sectors of the economy.”  Although politicians including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have been critical of the mining industry, O’Leary doesn’t think they will stymie development, especially once crypto miners realize it could be more profitable working within the regulatory system.  “The old ways of mining, ignoring politicians, policymakers, government, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) are over,” he said.  Twitter chatter  O’Leary also spoke out in support of Musk’s plan to buy Twitter, saying he thinks the billionaire could reboot the company.  “Twitter has done an abysmal job of creating value for shareholders since it went public just over nine years ago, creating zero value year after year,” O’Leary said.  He also criticized the microblogging site’s decision to influence conversations. “Silencing one voice and not another was a bad strategy” and “undermines the basis of democracy,” he said.  The social media platform needs “adult supervision,” and the biggest risk the company now faces “is that Elon Musk goes away.”  O’Leary said the social media behemoth is the “definition of hell on Earth,” though he didn’t say if a feature like “dogecoin tipping” would make it any better.

42420803,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcDl,1650658406,Binance Denies Allegations It Shared Russian Users' Data With Law Enforcement,"Binance, a major global cryptocurrency exchange, fiercely denied it had helped Russian authorities track down donations to the opposition, in response to an investigation published by Reuters on Friday.  According to Reuters, last April, Gleb Kostarev, Binance head of Eastern Europe and Russia, met with Russia's anti-money laundering agency, Rosfinmonitoring (Rosfin). According to Kostarev's messages reviewed by Reuters, he ""consented to Rosfin's request to agree to share client data,"" telling a colleague he didn't have ""much of a choice,"" the article said.  Around the same time, Rosfinmonitoring was looking for ways to track crypto donations to the organizations of Russia's opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Reuters wrote. Navalny raised millions in donations from supporters, with a surge of new funds after his assassination attempt and then arrest in Russia in January 2021.  On its official blog later on Friday, Binance posted that ""suggestions that Binance shared any user data, including Alexei Navalny, with Russian FSB-controlled agencies and Russian regulators are categorically false,"" adding that ""Binance has not sought to actively assist the Russian state in its attempts to investigate Alexei Navalny.""  Kostarev, in turn, posted on his Facebook page that it was ""an absolute lie"" that he or Binance ""leaked the data of Navalny or users to Rosfin or FSB.""  ""Today, any government or law enforcement agency in the world can request user data from Binance as long as it is accompanied by the proper legal authority. Russia is no different,"" Binance went on, saying that the crypto exchange ""has not entered into any form of agreement with the Russian government that differs from any other jurisdiction – these obligations are ordinary and any traditional bank for example would be subject to the same requirements.""  Binance ""will be writing a formal complaint to Reuters under their own editorial code,"" the statement reads.  Binance also published emails the company received from Reuters and its responses to it. In particular, Binance Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillmann asked Reuters's journalists about an ""off-the-record conversation"" and complained the media company did not agree, ""as there is quite an interesting story that should be told here, but we simply can't share it without putting our peoples' lives in danger,"" Hillmann wrote. He did not elaborate on what kind of danger was in question.  Indirect evidence  Although there are no direct indications of whether Binance indeed shared any user data with Rosfinmonitoring, Reuters noted that, last April, Kostarev took a meeting with Rosfinmonitoring officials arranged by the Digital Economy Development Fund and German Klimenko, former adviser to Russia President Vladimir Putin on internet development. Binance did not challenge the fact of the meeting itself.  Rosfinmonitoring is also closely associated with Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), Reuters wrote. FSB, a notorious secret service that is the successor of the KGB, sent its agents to poison Navalny with a nerve agent in the fall of 2019, according to a joint investigation by Bellingcat and Navalny's team.  Sergey Mendeleev, CEO of a crypto startup InDeFi, told CoinDesk he could not comment on the story as he is ""under the non-disclosure agreement related to the criminal case against the FBK."" The FBK is Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, which was labeled a ""terrorist organization"" by Russian authorities. At the moment, the organization is being investigated for a theft of donations – a charge it denies – while Navalny is in jail, doing time he was sentenced to for a slew of other charges. The politician's supporters, as well as multiple human rights advocates, believe the actual reason for Navalny's imprisonment is his vocal criticism of Putin's regime.  Amnesty International designated Navalny a Prisoner of Conscience last May, saying that ""Navalny has not been imprisoned for any recognizable crime, but for demanding the right to equal participation in public life for himself and his supporters, and for demanding a government that is free from corruption.""  According to Reuters' story, Binance ""told Reuters it had never been contacted by Russian authorities regarding Navalny."" It said that before Russia's war with Ukraine Binance was ""actively seeking compliance in Russia,"" which would have required it to respond to ""appropriate requests from regulators and law enforcement agencies,"" the article states.  Several sources in the Russian crypto market told CoinDesk they would not be surprised if Binance had cooperated with Rosfinmonitoring, although they were not aware of any direct evidence it had. Some noted that any cryptocurrency exchange working on the Russian market would have to respond to requests from an AML agency.  But Navalny's chief of staff Leonid Volkov, who has been managing the fundraising campaign, told CoinDesk he doesn't believe Binance actually shared Navalny donors' data with Fordinmonitoring. ""I believe Reuters was wrong. there are also multiple inconsistencies in the article.""  As an example of such inconsistency, Volkov mentioned that in April 2021, Binance did not require verification for all Russian users. The exchange, indeed, made KYC obligatory for Russian users in August 2021, meaning that before that, they could buy small amount of crypto and donate them to Navalny without giving their personal data to Binance at all.  The invasion's impact  Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine this winter, Binance had been taking active steps to become a legitimate part of Russia's crypto scene, joining regulatory working groups and even hiring the former central bank executive Olga Goncharova as its head of government relations.  ""Like every other blockchain company operating in Russia, prior to the war with Ukraine, Binance was actively pushing for Russia to develop an effective crypto regulatory framework – an effort we are undertaking in every market we operate in,"" Binance said in a statement shared with CoinDesk. It added that after the war started Binance ""aggressively implemented sanctions against Russia.""  After the invasion, Binance stopped accepting payments with Russia-issued Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) bank cards, following Visa and Mastercard themselves disconnecting Russian clients from the global payments networks. On Thursday, Binance also limited Russian accounts with balances over 10,000 euros to withdrawal-only mode.

42422844,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qM7h,1650657817,Market Wrap: Cryptos Slip as Bitcoin Struggles to Hold $40K,"Most cryptocurrencies traded lower on Friday, tracking losses in equities.  Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest crypto by market capitalization, dipped below $40,000, the midpoint of a three-month price range. Choppy trading conditions indicate uncertainty among traders, especially as macroeconomic and geopolitical risks linger.  Further, the rising correlation between BTC and stocks means investors are more sensitive to the impact of rising interest rates on asset values, similar to what occurred in 2014 and 2018. That could keep some buyers on the sidelines, which points to lower market returns, especially compared with the previous two years of unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  On Friday, most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) declined by less than bitcoin, which suggests the current pullback in prices could be temporary. Typically, altcoins underperform in a market sell-off because of their higher risk profile relative to bitcoin.  Technical indicators suggest that bitcoin could stabilize around $37,500 despite signs of slowing price momentum on the charts.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $39510, −4.05%    ●Ether (ETH): $2961, −2.08%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4272, −2.77%    ●Gold: $1935 per troy ounce, −0.52%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.91%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Traders cautious as volatility declines  The chart below shows the downtrend in bitcoin's implied volatility, which creates a difficult environment for some option traders who profit from unexpected price swings.  Still, traders have positioned themselves for short-term spikes in volatility or downside risk, especially around key events or announcements.  For example, on April 10, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of crypto derivatives trading platform BitMEX, warned about a BTC price crash toward $30,000. That blog post triggered massive selling of May and June option calls, which caused BTC and ETH risk reversals (calls minus puts) to fall from -6% to -10%, according to QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm.  ""At the same time, the recent proliferation of algorithmic stablecoins seems to have placed a soft floor in the market,"" QCP wrote in a Telegram announcement. ""While this effect has provided some relief to crypto markets, it remains to be seen if this model is sustainable in the long run.""  Bitcoin's put/call ratio ticked lower over the past few days, indicating a slight loss in bearish sentiment among options traders.

42421181,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd5C9,1650657541,Julie Pacino: Eliminating Middlemen in Film,"Julie Pacino was having writer’s block. When that happens, a change of scenery helps – so she headed from her home in Los Angeles to the Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo, a small, family-owned hotel that kept popping up on her Instagram feed.  “My intention was just to get away – and, yeah, take some photos, because that’s always something I love,” Pacino says. While taking photos of her friend posing throughout the meticulously designed inn (built in 1958 by a man as a “love letter” to his wife, who wanted a pink hotel), an idea for a movie hit her.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  “The story just started speaking to me, and we started acting out scenes,” she says. By the time she was on her way home, she’d planted the seeds for a new horror feature, “I Live Here Now,” about a pregnant actress who escapes Hollywood only to wind up in an even more sinister place.  But funding an independent feature isn’t easy. However, Pacino’s friends had already introduced her to non-fungible tokens (NFT) – one even mentioned how their use was blowing up among photographers hoping to sell their work directly to buyers. Pacino started following some NFT creators, like Justin Aversano, and learned that successful collections often had a story behind them. Her photos at the Madonna Inn would be perfect. “I thought, what if I do a collection of 100 of these photos and talk about how they inspired the story for a movie that's going to now be my first feature?” she says.  The NFT photos of the inn sold out quickly, to Pacino’s surprise, and she hasn’t looked back from NFTs since. She’s making the most of their utility – holders of the NFTs (including those of her Keepers of the Inn collection, which features another 3,000 plus photos from the inn) get creative say in the direction of her movie. “Every two weeks we have a town hall and I share with the community the decisions I’m making,” she says. “It peels back the curtain so people can see what goes into making a movie, because it’s [effing] nuts.”  After all, the film industry notoriously likes to keep its processes behind closed doors – the insiders are in and outsiders struggle to get in. Having grown up around the industry, Pacino understands this (her father is the actor Al Pacino). She sees Web 3 as a legitimate way to shake up Hollywood and let in a more diverse set of filmmakers.  She spoke with CoinDesk about how NFTs offer a more inclusive funding strategy for female, non-binary and LGBTQ+ creators, why she finds the NFT community so welcoming, and her mom’s mishaps with MetaMask.  How did you first get into crypto?  I've been hearing about crypto since 2011. I had a crazy friend, Jimmy, who was, like, ‘You’ve got to buy bitcoin!’ And everyone was. like, ‘Shut up, Jimmy.’ Now he's really rich and the rest of us are. like, ‘Why didn’t we [ever] buy bitcoin?’ But I didn't really start getting involved until about February last year. That's when I first was told about NFTs. Obviously, you need crypto to buy NFTs, so I started slowly educating myself on what was going on but it was very confusing. It took me a few months to really grasp the concept of why someone would want to spend money on a JPEG – it's obviously a barrier to entry. But so is being an artist in this Web 2 world where we're conditioned to think that our artwork isn't valuable, and that's just so [screwed] up.  There's a lot of cis white men that are calling the shots in Hollywood, that are disconnected from the mainstream audience’s perspective.  Your first NFT collection, the 100 photos from the Madonna Inn, sold out in less than 30 minutes. Did you expect that?  I didn't even want to do 100 photos. I'm, like, ‘This is crazy.’ [My friend] said, ‘Julie, your photos are good. There is a desire and hunger for content like this in the space.’ This was August, when [NFTs] started picking up for photography. And I remember telling my friend, if I sell 10 I'm going to flip out. Then we sold 100 in under 30 minutes and it was so surreal. On top of the sales, I was instantly getting flooded on Twitter with all this love, and so many interesting questions about my photos, people wanting to know about the movie I was making. I finally felt seen as an artist. That’s the moment I thought, I found my place. The reception of the community is what made me stay.  What is it about the NFT community that makes it so welcoming?  There's such an abundance mentality in this space that doesn't really exist outside of it, and certainly doesn't exist in Hollywood, which is very gatekept. The Web 3 community functions like there's enough for all of us to live off forever. The more you receive the less you try to hold onto it, and the more you let it flow and put it back out there. I made some money. I'm going to take what I need – I'm going to buy the shiny, new camera, awesome, I'm going to pay my bills – and now I've got this leftover money. What am I going to do with it? I'm going to put it towards other artists and make them feel the great feeling I'm feeling now. When I found the NFT space, I realized that is truly how the most successful people in this space function.  Obviously, you come from a legacy Hollywood film background. What do your family and friends in that world think of you embracing NFTs to fund your work?  My mom has a MetaMask. She has a Keepers of the Inn piece. She accidentally shredded her seed phrase and got locked out of her MetaMask. She wanted to call the blockchain – I'm just, like, OK, this is not for you. But she's happy that I'm doing it, and my dad, same sort of thing.  It's confusing to him, though I know he's trying to wrap his head around it. He's proud that I've found an innovative way to make my art. I've expressed to him how special of a place it is for artists. He's an artist and has always taught me that the artwork should come first and then everything else will follow naturally. That aspect of it, he fully understands and is excited about. So yeah, it's been an interesting journey with the parents for sure.  Do you think NFTs really can really change legacy Hollywood to make more room for women, non-binary, and LGBTQ+ filmmakers?  One hundred percent, because what Web 3 does is eliminate the need for middlemen. And they're called middlemen. There's a lot of cis white men that are calling the shots in Hollywood, that are disconnected from the mainstream audience’s perspective. Like, superhero movies and turning board games into movies? Sure, there's room for that, but I really think mainstream audiences want to consume thoughtful content.  There are a lot of artists who aren’t straight, white men, that have really cool [stuff] to say. Web 3 puts the control in our hands. I get to talk directly with my audience and sell to my audience directly. And my audience will tell me if what I've got is something they want to spend money on. The market is going to decide what’s good, not some dude in a suit who has no idea what I'm trying to express, who is trying to force me to put famous people in my movie that don't belong in my movie.  Film right now is hurting. Movies are not good anymore. They're not given the time and space to be good. That's a generalization – there are great films being made. But we're on the precipice of a golden age of cinema, because as cinema has gone downhill TV has taken over. Because TV executives and networks have given artists more freedom than cinema has.  Now, TV has become a little oversaturated, and we're at the point in the cycle where film can have a rebirth. I definitely believe that over the next five to 10 years, Web 3 will be credited for the rebirth of a new Hollywood era that gives power back to the artists.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/22/julie-pacino-eliminating-middlemen-in-film,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/915406310ae9ce604dcdc20975877667ab354f8a-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Staking pools allow agents interested in validating transactions to create a pool to which others can delegate their stake for some time. Agents refer to participants in the decentralized system who own at least some stake, usually in the form of a native token, as &apos;stakeholders.&apos; For example, agents that want to establish a staking pool could make more money from their transaction validation work. In this article, we will discuss some risks vs. returns of staking pools. Types of staking pools Staking pools are of two types, as explained below: Multiblockchain staking pools People can join pools for a variety of minor market-size PoS blockchain plans using these services. People can either join a proof-of-stake pool or provide a stake to a master node, which are the two most common pooling options. These are blockchain-specific and are dependent on how a project&apos;s PoS mechanism is set up. Simple PoS pool This project asserts that it is completely automated. There are now 20 Stakingpools and 48 Masternode Pools available. A master-nodepool is a pool in which the resources are used to create Masternodes. In order to qualify, every master node must lock a particular number of coins. Masternodes receive benefits as well, which are pooled if there is a pool.

A &apos;moving average&apos; (or MA in short) is an analytical tool that averages the price of Bitcoin over any desired range. As its name suggests, this average constantly updates itself as each day passes by and new prices are observed. The main benefit of an MA is that it evens out any local price fluctuations, and displays the trend as a smoother curve. This makes the tool quite useful for studying long-term trends, where day-to-day price changes aren&apos;t as important.

42411802,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg5zk,1650653642,What Is Yearn? A Guide to the Gateway of Decentralized Finance,"Yearn.Finance turned a lot of heads during the summer of 2020 – also known as DeFi Summer – after its token, YFI, rose from $3 to past $30,000 within months.  Founder Andre Cronje, a South African developer who worked on a myriad of cryptocurrency projects and later quit in March 2022, launched Yearn in early 2020 offering an easy-to-use gateway for those who wanted to automate their cryptocurrency investments to earn the highest yields.  Users quickly flocked to Yearn after its launch, locking $1.5 billion into the platform by September 2020. At its peak in November 2021, the total value locked in the network passed $6 billion, according to data.  While the token’s price retreated since then, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform still offers yields over 20% annually that makes it attractive during times of high inflation for crypto investors.  What is Yearn.Finance?  Yearn.Finance has been one of the pioneers of decentralized finance (DeFi), an umbrella term for automated, blockchain-based financial services that let investors lend, borrow and earn yields on their crypto assets.  Built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, Yearn.Finance is a smart contract protocol that works like an Amazon marketplace for interest-bearing crypto products.  It aggregates the offerings of other DeFi protocols such as Aave, Curve and Compound and helps investors find the highest yields on the market so they can optimize their crypto investments for the best returns by “profit switching.” This simply means automatically moving funds around to make the most of the best interest rates.  The yield can come from gas fees, trading fees, staking rewards and lending interests.  Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained  What you can do with Yearn  First, you have to connect your crypto wallet to the Yearn.Finance protocol.  There are a dozen available wallet options, from hot wallets to cold storage, that Yearn can connect to including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Ledger and Trezor.  Users can deposit crypto to their Yearn accounts through various blockchains that are integrated into the protocol: Ethereum, Fantom, Arbitrum.  Then, users can earn a yield by choosing different lending pools and strategies called vaults.  Vaults let users hold an asset they like while also earning yield denominated in that asset, so they can grow their stack. For instance, people who hold SUSHI, the token of decentralized exchange SushiSwap, can earn SUSHI by letting Yearn put their holdings into work.  Users deposit the asset into a vault and then Yearn borrows stablecoins against the asset. The stablecoins are then used to seek yield-farming opportunities, constantly rebalancing as opportunities shift.  What is the YFI token?  YFI is the native governance token of the Yearn platform.  When the token was launched in July 2020, it grabbed people's attention because Yearn's creator didn't set any tokens aside for himself or the company, as most cryptocurrency issuers tend to do. Instead, all of them were distributed to users who had deposits in certain key liquidity pools that benefited the project.  Initially, the circulating supply of the token was capped at only 30,000 YFI. Later, another 6,666 coins were added. According to the YFI documents, more can be minted if users vote for it.  So to get YFI now, users need to buy it.  Those who hold YFI can propose and vote on certain changes to be made to the platform. To do this, they have to stake their YFI tokens. Once votes have been cast, coins are locked for three days. Voters earn a small fee for participating in the decision-making process.  Read more: What Is a Dapp? Decentralized Apps Explained  Developments at Yearn  Standardization  In April 2022, Yearn endorsed the new ERC-4626 standard, which streamlines design for yield-bearing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.  Thanks to the new standard, developers don’t have to write new code to create custom vaults for every single new DeFi application. They can just build upon the new standard. It also creates a shared interface for the tokens held in vaults.  Developers say the standardization allows easier passage between protocols and can unlock innovation in decentralized finance.  Mergers  After launch, Yearn partnered or merged with a string of other DeFi projects such yield seeker Pickle Finance, hedging protocol Hegic, money market Cream and institutional DeFi portal Akropolis.  The goal of these partnerships was to expand Yearn’s offering to become a powerhouse for yield farming.  Hack  In February 2021, Yearn.Finance’s DAI lending pool suffered an exploit, which resulted in a loss of $11 million. The attacker got away with $2.8 million.  Exploits are a constant threat to your holdings in decentralized finance. Chainalysis reported that DeFi theft added up to $2.3 billion in 202. If your fund was stolen, chances are that it would never be recovered.

The 24-hour trading volume of Ripple is $1.99 Billion, marking a 12% rise. Past Performance of XRP The XRP coin price continues to move lower for the third day in a row. The coin price jumped almost 68% following a drop from the high of $1.01 reached in December. The increase allowed the token to surpass the $0.90 threshold.

42394222,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaT4F,1650651767,The Downfall of 'Shadow Banker' Reggie Fowler and Crypto's Rising Legitimacy,"Reginald Fowler is having a real bad time, and it couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.  A former leading player in the operations of “shadow bank” Crypto Capital, Fowler was initially indicted on charges of banking fraud in 2019 and additional charges in 2020. Among the allegations Fowler faces are that he opened U.S. business banking accounts that he claimed would be used for real estate investing, but were instead part of Crypto Capital’s operations. Fowler, a former football player turned investor, faces as much as 70 years in prison.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here  Fowler’s lawyers now say he will plead guilty to charges including bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy, and has asked to forego a trial. The plea does not involve a deal with prosecutors for lighter sentencing. In January of 2020, Fowler was reportedly close to an apparent plea deal on a single count of operation of an unlicensed money transmitter, but that deal fell through, reportedly because of financial issues.  Fowler’s assets were frozen by the Department of Justice following the 2019 indictment, and his financial issues do indeed seem severe. In November, his legal counsel withdrew from the case, saying they had not been paid. In discussion about finding new representation with the judge at the time, Fowler said, “I have used all my assets. I put my properties up for bail. I can't get a bank account. We don't have any income. We can't get to the assets. I want to find a firm that understands that.”  That’s quite a fall from grace for the briefly high-flying shadow banker, who joined Crypto Capital in 2017 and was indicted just two years later. During a period when traditional banking was even more difficult for cryptocurrency operations than it is now, Crypto Capital is known to have serviced the exchanges Bitfinex, BitMEX, Kraken and the defunct QuadrigaCX.  But they may have been up to much more: Crypto Capital founder Ivan Manuel Molina Lee was arrested in Poland, also in 2019, on allegations that Crypto Capital was also involved in laundering money for drug cartels.  Seemingly in part because of that little side hustle, Crypto Capital wound up being a very bad crypto shadow bank. Most notoriously, authorities in 2019 seized $850 million that Crypto Capital was reportedly holding for Bitfinex. The New York Attorney General later fined Bitfinex and Tether for trying to hide the losses. QuadrigaCX experienced serious problems with withdrawal delays at Crypto Capital, problems seemingly unrelated to other shady dealings at the Canadian exchange.  Fowler’s downfall was nearly inevitable – not just because he was in bed with bad people, but because he himself seems short on both ethics and competence. For instance, Fowler is sometimes described as a “former NFL investor,” but his escapades in the big leagues were a lot closer to slapstick than business. He lost his stake in the Vikings in 2014 after failing to make payments because of problems with his other businesses, according to Minnesota’s Star Tribune. The Tribune also reports that Fowler lied about his accomplishments repeatedly, including the bizarre fabrication that he played in the Little League World Series.  There’s little reason to feel sorry for a man who helped lose a lot of people huge amounts of money, and who may have abetted violent drug cartels. But there is nonetheless something tragic in the story: If they’d done things the right way, Fowler, Molina Lee and the rest of the Crypto Capital crew would be looking forward to huge success instead of facing lengthy prison stints.  See also: The Story Behind QuadrigaCX and Gerald Cotten  As Fowler awaited trial, regulated banks, most notably Silvergate, moved aggressively to serve cryptocurrency companies, an already large market that seems poised to continue growing. Silvergate’s revenue doubled in the first quarter of this year.  Fowler is hardly the only person who got involved in crypto at a time of infinite possibility, then fumbled the bag thanks to a mix of ineptitude and short-term greed. He will likely wind up in prison thanks to his bad judgment and lackluster character, and he helped drag a lot of people down with him.  It’s a significant lesson for investors and business operators, particularly in light of Fowler’s rich history of lies and screw ups: there was a time when being in crypto meant sometimes having no choice but to deal with obviously sketchy characters, but that time has passed. It’s time to relegate Reggie Fowler and his ilk to the dustbin of history.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,David Z.

Most technical indicators are neutral, although a significant loss of upside momentum on the monthly chart increases the probability of a break below BTC's year-long price range. Further, the recent increase in sell volume relative to buy volume means traders have been reluctant to maintain long positions after the 2020 crypto rally.

On Friday, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) added three Ethereum addresses to its sanctions list, joining an address listed last week that the federal government tied to the theft of around $600 million in crypto from Axie Infinity's Ronin bridge. All three addresses had received sizable inbound transfers of stolen ether (ETH) from the originally sanctioned wallet over the past week.  The operators of the Ronin exploit wallet, said by the FBI and OFAC to be North Korea's Lazarus hacking group, have been laundering funds by moving them from a sanctioned address to an intermediary address before sending the funds to Tornado Cash, a mixer designed to obfuscate the source and destination of funds moved through the service.  This pattern repeated on Friday, when funds moved from one of the newly sanctioned addresses to another intermediary before once again landing at Tornado Cash.  None of the sanctioned addresses have directly interacted with Tornado Cash.  The nature of Tornado Cash makes it difficult for the operators of the service to blacklist addresses, as OFAC requires any entities touching the U.S. financial system to do. The mixer adopted a compliance tool offered by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis that lets it blacklist certain addresses, but only on the user-facing decentralized app that Tornado Cash's operators can influence. Individuals can still use the protocol itself to bypass this compliance tool.  Also, at least as of last week, the Chainalysis tool only listed the originally sanctioned address.  A representative for Tornado Cash previously told CoinDesk that ""OFAC is the judge of what addresses need to be banned.""  ""It’s a guessing game so far. I assume only 1 address has been identified by OFAC that should be sanctioned relating to that event. Which means Chainalysis update[s] whatever is in sanction’s list,"" the representative said.

The update places “regulatory risks” up there, too.  The company last week restricted new “Earn” program sign-ups in the U.S. to accredited investors.  “We have been in ongoing discussions with United States regulators regarding our Earn product,” the company said in an April 11 blog post. “As a result, there will be changes to the way our Earn product will work for users based in the United States.”  Last September, state securities regulators ordered Celsius to prove Earn wasn’t an unregistered security.

42395494,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxSBP,1650648053,Sanctioning an Ether Address Isn't Stopping Transactions,"I heard some of y’all took issue with my suspicion that a spot bitcoin ETF won’t be approved this year. Come tell me why I’m wrong! But in the meantime, let’s talk about crypto and its relationship to sanction enforcement, specifically within the context of last week’s revelation that North Korea was behind the Axie Infinity Ronin breach.  And apologies for the lateness of this week’s newsletter. Need to claim extenuating circumstances, and next week’s will be in your inbox on Tuesdays as normal.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Sanctions evasion  The narrative  According to the U.S. government, a North Korea-linked hacking group was behind last month’s $625 million Ronin bridge hack. In other words, a nation state was behind one of the largest crypto hacks. There's a growing story in North Korea’s actions here, but that actually isn’t the main point of interest for me.  Why it matters  North Korea appears to be hacking crypto exchanges and networks to seize funds for its own personal usage. And of more immediate interest, adding an Ethereum address to the U.S. sanctions list does not appear to have halted the laundering of funds.  Breaking it down  The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) added a single, solitary Ethereum address to its Specially Designated Nationals list, otherwise known as its sanctions list.  The address was tied to the hack of Axie Infinity’s Ronin Bridge, which saw some 173,000 ETH and 25.5 million USDC (worth around $625 million on March 29) stolen from the bridge network.  What’s really interesting is the wallet continued to send funds out after it was added to the sanctions list. Within 24 hours the controller of the wallet – said to be the North Korean hacker organization known as Lazarus – sent nearly 3,000 ETH to coin mixer Tornado Cash, repeating a pattern the hackers began after stealing the ether.  These transfers out continued through earlier this week. In many cases, the funds appear to have gone to an intermediary wallet before being sent to Tornado Cash.  In the past, parties that assisted sanctioned entities faced being added to the U.S. sanctions list themselves.  Anand Sithian, counsel at Crowell & Moring and a former trial attorney in the money laundering division at the U.S. Department of Justice, said crypto companies should watch for addresses and wallets tied to mixers, and in particular the fact that regulators like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) have “highlighted the financial crimes risks associated with mixers, which obfuscate the source of transactions, and thereby prevent tracing transactions on the blockchain.”  “To the extent there are U.S. touch points, or U.S. persons involved in such transactions, crypto companies could face enforcement from FinCEN, OFAC and/or the U.S. Department of Justice, depending on the activity at issue and whether any U.S. laws were violated,” he said. “Even without a violation, an investigation can be incredibly taxing on resources and distracting to leadership. As a result, crypto companies may wish to steer clear of mixers, to the extent possible.”  Tornado Cash’s executives have said that sanctions cannot be applied to the protocol itself, former CoinDesker and current Bloomberger Muyao Shen reported last month.  On Friday, the mixer added a Chainalysis compliance tool to its user-facing decentralized application that blocks transactions from the sanctioned address – though, again, the protocol itself is unaffected.  Regulators may not agree, but at least so far, the funds are continuing to move.  Meanwhile, on the North Korea front, the U.S. government is warning that the nation may continue to try and exploit crypto companies (and others) to raise funds.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  U.S. President Joe Biden formally announced his intention to nominate former Treasury official, former Ripple board member and current University of Michigan Dean Michael Barr to be the Fed vice chair for supervision.  Elsewhere:  Some Indian Payment Processors Cut Off Local Crypto Exchanges: A handful of Indian crypto exchanges announced they were halting rupee deposits or withdrawals.  Attacker Drains $182M From Beanstalk Stablecoin Protocol: So my understanding is this wasn’t a hack or exploit, and can perhaps only technically be described as an attack. At any rate, the perpetrator here used a flash loan (a loan that is repaid almost instantaneously, perhaps within the same block) to borrow a hefty number of Beanstalk’s governance tokens, which the attacker used to vote in favor of a protocol change that sent all of Beanstalk’s funds to the attacker. All of this was “legal” in terms of the code’s setup.  Crypto Proponents Fear SEC 'Backdoor' Regulations on Exchanges, Dealers: CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton digs into a pair of SEC proposals that has the crypto industry up in arms: Basically each proposal would appear to redefine the terms “exchange” and “dealer” (respectively) in such a way that they might encompass crypto protocols and decentralized platforms. However, it’s not clear – and this uncertainty has industry advocates worried.

This is presumed to be caused by major sell-offs in the market. However, exchange metrics continue to show that this is not entirely the case. Exchange balances have been plummeting for the past year pointing towards massive accumulation trends and this has come to a head after bitcoin exchange balances have touched a new 4-year low. Exchange Balances Plummet It is no secret that the bitcoin being left on centralized exchanges has been declining. However, the margin by which this has been on the decline is more important. Even during times when the price of bitcoin had been on a recovery trend and headed into a bull market, exchange balances continued to plummet.

There are cultural shifts taking place today that show immense potential to completely flip traditional models on their heads - from how we look at content, gaming, finance, and more. Play-to-earn gaming has reaped massive rewards from this shift and is poised to continue to do so as societal adoption grows. However, in the early days of play-to-earn titles earning legitimacy and status, along too has come inherent barriers to entry. The costs of acquiring many of the base-level NFTs just to get involved in some of the biggest P2E titles today have become so high, that there are rent-seekers that have started to gate the experience. Additionally, some play-to-earn titles have implemented a sort of subscription model, and others merely have entry prices that run into many thousands of dollars. High costs aren&apos;t the only concern, as even some of the biggest play-to-earn titles have faced challenges around blockchain vulnerabilities. Additionally, the traditional gaming environment has been hesitant in accepting the play-to-earn structure, and the costs of developing a strong gaming title are high.

42395496,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxS8S,1650641777,"Bailout Fund, Backstop or Bouncy Ball? Here's How LFG's Bitcoin 'Reserve' Might Work","Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) has been making headlines over the past month as one of the biggest bitcoin (BTC) buyers for a new ""reserve,"" seemingly appearing out of nowhere to scoop up $1.7 billion of the largest cryptocurrency by market value.  But what is the LFG reserve's purpose, and for what would it use the bitcoin?  According to LFG's website, the reserve is set up to support the Terra ecosystem – a blockchain-based project focused around a dollar-pegged stablecoin known as UST and a cryptocurrency called LUNA.  Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraforms Labs and the project's leader, described LFG in a tweet as a “decentralized [foreign exchange] reserve” for UST. According to LFG's website, Kwon serves as director and founding member of the LFG organization.  The matter starts to get confusing, though, because the token's design as an ""algorithmic stablecoin"" means UST is ""not backed or collateralized by bitcoin or any other asset,"" according to a Terraform Labs spokesperson.  So it's a ""reserve"" for UST – but not backing UST?  With little in writing from LFG to explain how the reserve works, some analysts are drawing their own interpretations.  “To me the LFG reserve is something between an insurance policy and a backstop of last resort,” said Felix Hartmann, head of Florida hedge fund Hartmann Capital. ""It is a psychological backstop, similar to FDIC, to comfort people that this in fact is not a house of cards.” FDIC stands for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures U.S. bank deposits.  At the core of the matter are crucial questions about fast-growing crypto markets: Will these computer code-based projects built on blockchains actually work on their own without external support, and are they truly decentralized?  Read more: ‘Built to Fail’? Why TerraUSD’s Growth Is Giving Finance Experts Nightmares  Trust the algorithm  As the industry has developed, stablecoins have taken two forms: The biggest, like tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC), say they're backed by enough assets that will guarantee that each token is worth at least $1.  But a new breed of ""algorithmic stablecoins"" like UST exist as ""protocols"" – basically lines of programming on a blockchain that supposedly will assure the token stays pegged at $1. (The stablecoin is officially known as terraUSD but also goes by UST, its trading symbol.)  Even so, many early versions of algorithmic stablecoins have crashed – Beanstalk being the latest. So questions have arisen about how sustainable UST's growth might be, with a market capitalization that grew by $15 billion in five months. It now stands as the third-largest stablecoin.  The new reserve might serve to address any gaps in the confidence. Kwon has hinted that purchases will not stop until the reserves reach $10 billion, saying that “BTC reserves will open a new monetary era of the Bitcoin standard.”  So how would the LFG bitcoin reserve work?  LFG describes certain elements of the ""UST reserve protocol"" on its website, but how it would work – or under what circumstances it might kick in – isn't completely spelled out.  According to the website, LFG is a ""nonprofit organization established in the Republic of Singapore dedicated to creating and providing greater economic sovereignty, security, and sustainability of open-source software and applications that help build and promote a truly decentralized economy.""  It might be no coincidence that ""LFG"" is a widely used acronym in crypto lingo to express enthusiasm or optimism for a trade. It stands for ""Let's f**king go.""  CoinDesk asked the Terraform Labs spokesperson if there was anything detailed in writing about the LFG reserve that officials could provide, and she referred us to a March 23 proposal on Terra’s research platform,from a trading firm called Jump Trading, which also happens to be Jump Crypto’s parent company, a lead investor in the LFG project.  It gets complicated – real fast – but the idea in the proposal is that the reserve would provide an additional leg to stabilize UST’s price if it falls way below the peg.  Read more: What Is LUNA and UST? A Guide to the Terra Ecosystem  Under the Jump Trading proposal, which has yet to get the green light, LFG would transfer the UST reserve assets to a dedicated reserve pool.  This reserve would be accessible only in “emergencies but not otherwise,” according to the proposal.  The suggested threshold was $0.98 – i.e., if things deteriorated to the point where traders were willing to exchange $1 of UST coins for 98 cents of bitcoin – a 2% downward deviation from the $1 peg. Such a level, according to Jump Trading, would ""prevent the fund from being utilized for ordinary movements in the price of UST in favor of extraordinary movements only.”  But if the emergency conditions actually materialized, retail investors could swap their UST for bitcoin (or other assets in reserve pool) at a discount.  The proposal doesn't say this specifically, but ostensibly the mechanism would establish a price floor for UST, and buyers would step in if price falls below $0.98.  “It creates demand for UST by arbitrageurs who can buy UST at, say, $0.97 and convert it for BTC at $0.98,"" said Jordi Alexander, chief investment officer of Selini Capital. “This should create a more hard floor at $0.98 and prevent a cataclysmic redemption flow into LUNA because at that point, say, UST was going to $0.97, people would arbitrage the price back up.”  Theoretically, the price floor for UST would help to restore the coin's market value back to the $1 peg.  Dustin Teander, an analyst at the crypto research and data firm Messari, said that “in the same way a gym floor provides a firm surface for a basketball to bounce, the reserves provide UST a price floor to bounce off of.”  When the crisis passes, the reserve pool drains its UST holding by letting traders purchase UST at the $1 peg with BTC.  “Can $2 billion in reserves really protect $17 billion of stablecoin from collapsing? Of course not. But it is a psychological backstop to comfort people that this in fact is not a house of cards,” said Hartmann.  The proposal is still in the feedback process on Agora, the research forum of Terraform Labs where users can discuss governance and development initiatives.  “The proposal process on Agora is for eliciting feedback and calibrating the design before moving forward with the specs for the BTC Reserve. Currently, bridging solutions are being explored for adding BTC to the Reserve, and a timeline for the launch of the Reserve is still TBD [to be decided],” Terraform Labs spokesperson told CoinDesk in a statement.  “As of now, the proposal is being built out – not by Jump, but by other partners of Terra – before being presented again to the community,” Nihar Shah, a researcher at Jump Crypto, Jump Trading's filial said in an email.  LFG didn’t return requests for comment.  Perpetual need for demand  All of this would just be another in-the-weeds explanation of the rules of a complex blockchain protocol – a dime a dozen in crypto – if it weren't for the fact that so much money was at stake.  Terra’s UST toppled Binance USD as the third-largest stablecoin behind Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC because its circulating supply has grown nearly tenfold over the past year to a whopping $17 billion. The price of LUNA, UST’s sister token that absorbs the stablecoin’s price swings, exploded to $95 from $13 a year ago.  The fast growth has raised concerns that a collapse of the UST peg might trigger systemic failures in crypto markets. LUNA's market capitalization is just over $70 billion. Bitcoin's is $770 billion.  “A late implosion of LUNA would be catastrophic for the space,” bringing down the industry into a “cold, bitter, long winter,” Galois Capital argued in a tweet.  The steady rise is mainly fueled by Anchor, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on top of the Terra blockchain, which currently holds more than half of the total supply of UST, some $9.5 billion – locked up on the platform, thanks to a tempting 19.5% annual yield that savers can reap on their UST deposits.  Yield-hungry depositors flocked to Anchor, fueling the demand for UST, but the platform’s revenue can’t keep up with yield payout and it already needed a $450 million bailout in February.  'Step back' risk – LFG or GTFO?  As long as UST grows via demand-creating schemes such as Anchor’s subsidized yields, the algorithmic peg seems to hold fine. But what happens if the “only-up” market ends and demand dwindles?  Jump Trading’s proposal assumes robust private markets and liquidity for UST, while one of the main criticisms of algorithmic stablecoins is their constant need to generate demand; otherwise, they break the peg and collapse.  In a research paper, Ryan Clements, chair in business law and regulation at the University of Calgary, argued that algorithmic stablecoins must generate a perpetual demand in the underlying ecosystem and the arbitrage mechanism to remain stable. Translation: The $1 pegging mechanism for UST might not hold if traders who help to maintain the system were to lose confidence, and back away altogether.  “Perpetual demand, and reliance on arbitrage, is not certain because of 'step-back' risk,” Clements told CoinDesk in email. Step-back risk refers to an event when trust in an algorithmic stablecoin evaporates and investors lose interest in executing the arbitrage to stabilize the price, so the stablecoin drifts into a death spiral.  Read more: The Risks Behind LUNA-UST Stablecoin, According to a Bearish Academic  There is no shortage of examples for that. Beanstalk Farms, an Ethereum-based stablecoin protocol, was exploited for $182 million in a hack on April 17, and its BEAN token collapsed to $0.03 from the $1 peg after the attack. In July 2021, Iron Finance’s stablecoin, which was partially asset-backed and also pegged algorithmically, imploded when investors panic-sold its sister token, TITAN.  Clements cited various potential threats to the stability of UST. For example, Anchor may not be able to sustain its current high yield and depositors flee, a sell-off in bitcoin might transmit volatility to UST, or trading activity may not be sufficient to replenish the reserves.  LUNA has already had a close encounter with losing its peg. When the crypto market crashed in May 2021, UST briefly dropped to $0.87 and LUNA collapsed to $4 from $20.  If only LUNA can absorb the price deviation of UST, selling LUNA for UST makes the situation worse. So, having billions of dollars worth of bitcoin in reserve can counteract the downward spiral in price.  “It should materially reduce the risk of a catastrophic failure. Not to zero, of course,” Dragonfly Capital Managing Partner Haseeb Qureshi said.  Then is UST still decentralized?  The reserve was not part of the Terra blockchain protocol’s original design, nor are there any mentions in the white paper that Terra would need any other assets – apart from the UST and LUNA used in the algorithm – to maintain the peg.  “LFG's backstop of BTC reserves turns UST into something closer to Celo's model, which is a mix of seigniorage shares with crypto collateral,” Qureshi said. Celo’s stablecoins are partially backed by assets and an algorithm adjusting its supply.  Can UST claim to be decentralized? Analysts are split.  “The fact that [Terraform Labs] needs a centralized entity (LFG) to inject capital, purchase reserves and continually take actions to strengthen the underlying Terra ecosystem (and create more and more use cases for UST) seriously calls into question the 'decentralized' assertion of Terra,” said Clements.  By contrast, Messari’s Teander said UST would remain decentralized through the whole process.  “The BTC only practically comes into the equation once the Jump proposal is implemented, and when it does, it will be controlled in a decentralized protocol, not the centralized LFG organization,” he said.  Jordi Alexander of Selini Capital said that it takes many steps for a crypto project to get to decentralization.  “I see it like a parent having a child,” Alexander said. “You first give birth to them and have to guide them through childhood and education years by supporting and making decisions, until eventually when they are adults and ready to leave the house. If you have done a good job they will manage to be successfully independent without you.”  UPDATE (19:45 UTC): This update includes statement about the status and prospective launch of the proposal from Terraform Labs spokesperson.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | LUNA | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/22/bailout-fund-backstop-or-bouncy-ball-heres-how-lfgs-bitcoin-reserve-might-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4203373c9895eea462b82f9b1b26f4c6650ddeb7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394219,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaSor,1650639481,‘Built to Fail’? Why TerraUSD’s Growth Is Giving Finance Experts Nightmares,"Late on Monday, April 18, the stablecoin terraUSD (UST) edged out Binance’s BUSD to become the third-largest stablecoin by market cap. There are now nearly $18 billion UST in circulation. That’s well below the nearly $50 billion total for Circle’s USDC, or the $82 billion worth of Tether’s USDT roaming the Earth.  But UST is also much different from those competitors, in ways that could make it incredibly risky.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here. Michael Casey is away.  Stablecoins are tokens tracked by a blockchain, but in contrast to assets like bitcoin (BTC), they’re intended to consistently match the buying power of a fiat currency, most often the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins were first created to give active crypto traders a tool for moving quickly between more volatile positions, though as we’ll see, the potential for big interest rates on loans has also helped attract capital.  USDT and USDC are so-called “backed” or collateralized stablecoins. They keep their 1:1 dollar “peg” because they are (ostensibly) backed by bank accounts holding dollars, or by other dollar equivalent assets, for which tokens can be redeemed – although Tether has been notoriously reticent to specify the nature of its reserves.  UST, by contrast, began life as what’s known as an “algorithmic” stablecoin. These could also be referred to as “decentralized” stablecoins because decentralization is their primary reason for existing. A collateralized stablecoin like USDT or USDC is reliant on banks and traditional markets. That makes them in turn subject to regulation, enforcement and ultimately, censorship of transactions. Circle and Tether are run by centralized corporate entities with the ability to blacklist users and even seize their funds. Both systems have done this, sometimes at government behest.  In principle, algorithmic stablecoins like UST don’t have this censorship risk because they are not run by centralized corporate structures and do not hold backing in traditional institutions like banks. Of course, in reality “decentralization” is relative, and most such systems today still have key men, such as Do Kwon at Terraform Labs, or affiliated organizations that provide labor and funding. Whatever a system’s “decentralized” branding, regulators can still go after such public targets, a risk that’s worth keeping in mind.  What that algo does  Instead of being backed by assets like dollars or bonds, algorithmic stablecoins are intended to maintain their dollar peg by what looks to some like financial alchemy. But experts are highly skeptical that these systems’ designers have actually figured out how to turn lead into gold.  Broadly, algorithmic stablecoins rely on a pair of tokens, both created ex nihilo at the token’s launch. One token is the stablecoin itself – terraUSD, frax, neutrinoUSD – and the other is the corresponding “balancer token” ­– LUNA, FXS or WAVES, respectively. Generally, the balancer token can be “burned,” or destroyed, to create more of the corresponding stablecoin.  The defining algorithm in an “algorithmic stablecoin” is a function that changes the amount of the balancer token required to create the stablecoin. This changing burn value is intended to create arbitrage opportunities for traders: gaps between the price of the balancer token and the stablecoin that they can profit from, but that also drive the price of the stablecoin toward its peg. In principle, this would attract profit-motivated traders to drive the stablecoin back to $1 whenever the peg wavered.  The nuances of these systems vary, but it doesn’t take much financial expertise to see reason for skepticism. Let’s hear it from an expert anyway.  “You have a two-token system and one token has no intrinsic value, it’s only derived from secondary trading value, and the other token is supposed to be a stable token, and you have an arbitrage,” wonders Ryan Clements, an assistant professor of Business Law at the University of Calgary. “At some point you look at the one with no intrinsic value and you think, why is this worth $5?”  Clements’ past research has focused on arbitrage risks and instability in exchange-traded funds, where there can be a similar disconnect between the price of a synthetic asset and that of its underlying components. Last year, Clements published a paper about algorithmic stablecoins called “Built to Fail,” arguing that the systems are inherently fragile and can never be truly “stable.” (Note that MakerDAO’s DAI is a bit of an outlier with some unique design features, and these critiques don’t necessarily apply to it.)  Clements argues the theory behind algorithmic stablecoins relies on three specific flawed assumptions. An algorithmic stablecoin, he writes, can only function when three conditions are met at all times:  There is a “support level of demand” for the stablecoin and/or balancer token  There’s a permanent supply of independent actors to perform price-stabilizing arbitrage  A market has near-perfect information to trade on  But Clements argues these assumptions break down frequently, particularly during times of instability.  One clear sign of this, according to Kevin Zhou of hedge fund Galois Capital, is that the teams behind algorithmic stablecoins sometimes have to essentially step in and do the balancing arbitrage themselves.  “Some of these algo [systems] are market-making,” says Zhou. “I don’t know if it’s them directly, or they give a loan to a market maker to maintain the peg.”  There’s even clearer evidence from algos that have already collapsed, most notably Iron Finance, which unwound in a “death spiral” in June 2021. As Novum Alpha CEO Patrick Tan explained the Iron Finance unwind at the time, “The speed at which [balancer token] TITAN started to fall caused [supposed stablecoin] IRON to lose its peg, allowing traders to redeem IRON, which was priced at US$0.90 as the peg started to slip, for US$0.75 in stablecoin and US$0.25 in TITAN.” The system’s stablecoin and balancer tokens have both since dropped to near zero.  Similar opportunities for profit can emerge whenever an algorithmic stablecoin slips too far from its peg. Once the arbitrage emerges, it becomes self-perpetuating and self-accelerating. Without outside intervention, it is an unavoidable death sentence.  Neither algorithmic nor stable?  The team behind LUNA/UST seem to agree with the idea that such systems can’t work. They don’t say so out loud, but they’ve made a variety of efforts to add more stability into the system, and those efforts have accelerated alongside UST’s growth.  It is important to note the terraUSD stablecoin is the central function of the entire Luna layer 1 blockchain, which also has general smart-contract functionality. Luna also has a variety of other tools and functions, including the Anchor lending platform, non-fungible tokens (NFT), initial coin offerings (ICO) and the like. The strategy here, as laid out by Luna bull José Maria Macedo of Delphi Digital on a recent episode of the “Bankless” podcast, is that demand for these tools will provide another source of support for the price of LUNA and, in turn, improve the stability of UST.  Clements acknowledged this ecosystem play makes UST the algorithmic stablecoin that “seems to have the most logical potential for stability.” But, he said, “I don’t think an ecosystem play is nearly as stable as something like USDC.”  The biggest question mark in the ecosystem, according to Clements and others, is Anchor. Anchor has attracted nearly $16 billion of deposits of LUNA, wrapped ETH (backed by actual ether that’s tied up on the Ethereum chain) and, above all, UST usually “bonded” (or locked) for long periods of time. This provides stability by preventing the sale of a large chunk of UST.  The problem is the deposit demand is essentially an illusion. Anchor provides 20% APY on locked deposits, but that rate isn’t profitable for the system: The current APR being offered to borrowers is just 11.81%. A lender is only sustainable if it collects more interest on its loans than it pays out to deposits.  That gap between lender and borrower APY is covered by a reserve fund that has been draining rapidly as the amount locked in Anchor grows. Moreover, even at 11.81%, lending demand seems light: With $15.5 billion locked in Anchor, only $3.2 billion of loans are outstanding, according to data provider DeFiLlama.  “All the UST in Anchor is just rotator capital, farming for the subsidized yield,” said Zhou. “Rotator capital” means money that is moved rapidly from one protocol to another in search of high yield (what Wall Streeters used to call “hot money”). If Anchor’s yield drops below the competition, there could be a significant rush to the exits, during which “rotators” in the staking pool would look to unload their LUNA and UST.  That seems practically inevitable because there isn’t an infinite amount of money to pour into the reserve fund. As soon as that financial nitroglycerin runs out, it could create the conditions for a depegging of terraUSD.  But the people behind Luna have come up with an answer to that, too. Starting in February, the affiliated Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) began purchasing bitcoin to create a further backstop for TerraUSD. The LFG reserve, including bitcoin and other assets, now totals about $2.3 billion.  It’s still unclear how this reserve will actually wind up working. The BTC is still held by LFG, not by the luna/terraUSD protocol. Debate is currently ongoing in the Luna community over proposals for integrating a second, different kind of reserve asset into the previously purely algorithmic system. The broad contours of the proposals, however, all involve an automated and arbitrage-incentivized mechanism that would open swaps from UST to BTC when the UST peg wavers.  There are two reasons to wonder whether this is a real solution. First, it doesn’t change the basic math of UST’s exit liquidity in a crisis. According to Zhou, the total of all non-LUNA reserves and all UST being used in applications on the Luna chain only amounts to about $3 billion, against $18 billion in stablecoins outstanding.  “So there’s about $14 billion that needs to exit through luna in a compression or unwind,” said Zhou. That kind of selling pressure would likely drive down the price of luna itself dramatically, he argued, essentially blocking all the exits at the exact moment the building is on fire. “On a full unwind, some people are going to be left holding the bag, either in terraUSD that is depegged, or in hyperinflated luna that has no bid.”  But it might be even worse than that. What if building a BTC reserve actually increases the likelihood of a bank run?  “This could create an incentive (effectively an economic moral hazard) to utilize strategies to acquire discounted BTC,” Clements says of the plan. Such a coordinated, intentional attack could look similar to George Soros’s legendary attack on the British pound. The Bank of England spent more than 3.3 billion pounds countertrading to defend the pound’s peg against other European currencies, but ultimately failed.  Attacking a pegged asset could be described as an attempt to acquire the backing assets at a discount, by forcing a fire sale of the collateral. Especially given that BTC is a harder asset and generally superior money to LUNA/UST (and if it isn’t, it’s not much of a reserve asset), it is nearly a law of nature that LUNA or UST holders will seek to transform those tokens into BTC.  The sharks may already be circling.  “There’s a lot of incentive to attack the peg, especially for people outside the [crypto] space,” said Zhou. “There’s a lot of these Chicago [traders], they don’t give a [damn]. If they see an opportunity, they’re going to Soros-attack it. They’re just waiting for the right moment … I think [UST] will collapse on its own, but if someone attacks it, it will collapse even faster.”  There are other concerns, both with the BTC reserve plan and terraUSD’s basic structure. For instance, one aspect of a leading proposal for the reserve would rely on offering traders arbitrage incentives to replenish the BTC reserves once a crisis has passed. That’s perfectly sensible from a decentralization perspective, since in the long term you don’t want to rely on outside groups like LFG.  “But what happens if there isn't enough trading activity to replenish the [BTC] reserves outside of crises?” asks Clements. “This is another ongoing vulnerability, in my opinion.”  An even more fundamental question may be exactly how much leash regulators will give Do Kwon and his fellow travelers. The various capital injections and reserve restructurings make it clear there’s not much that’s “decentralized” about luna/terraUSD. At $18 billion, terraUSD is far from a systemic risk for mainstream finance, but continued growth could certainly invite the proverbial Eye of Sauron.  And while it’s not a big worry for Wall Street, luna/terraUSD could be a systemic risk to the cryptosphere. Do Kwon has said he would like to grow the system’s BTC holdings to $10 billion. But if that reserve is integrated in the wrong way, it could create the conditions for a future sudden flood of BTC for sale if the peg is attacked or breaks under market strain.  “Could the utilization of the bitcoin reserve transmit volatility across the crypto ecosystem?” Clements asked on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.” “It would seem obvious that it could.”  So while Iron Finance sank alone, terraUSD could drag others down with it.",NEGATIVE,BTC | LUNA,BTC | FIAT | LUNA | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,David Z.

42411804,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg633,1650638116,Dollar Cost Averaging: Build Crypto Wealth on a Budget,"Whether you’re looking to part with $100 or $100,000, there’s always the fear that following an initial investment, the market will go down and you lose money. On the other hand, the idea of missing a rally is equally as daunting and often leaves investors overeager to invest quickly.  Fortunately, there’s a third strategy that sits nicely between the two options.  What is dollar cost averaging?  Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is the process of investing your money over time. Instead of investing in one single lump sum and trying to time the market to your advantage, you divide your initial investment into several tranches and trade at a set time periodically.  For example, an individual with $100,000 to invest may decide to:  Invest $25,000 per quarter for four quarters.  Invest $8,333 per month for 12 months.  Invest $3,846 every two weeks for 26 weeks.  Invest $1,923 per week for 52 weeks.  The idea behind this method is that by purchasing smaller amounts over a period of time as opposed to in one go, you’re more likely to average out with a better return.  Most people tend to set strict schedules and specific times when placing DCA trades. For example, Bob might decide to split his $10,000 into 100 tranches of $100 and use each tranche to purchase bitcoin (BTC) every Monday at exactly 12:00 ET, regardless of what the bitcoin market price is at each interval. He hopes that after he’s spent his entire $10,000 amount, he will end up with more BTC than if he went all-in on a single trade.  Read More: Why Invest in Cryptocurrency?  Platforms that provide automated dollar cost averaging  Modern investment platforms and trading software, such as Coinbase, 3Commas and Cryptohopper, are built to facilitate dollar cost averaging. The user will link their bank account to their investment account or deposit an initial amount and manually set up the scheduled contributions.  The investment platforms are able to automate the investments; beyond the initial setup, there is very little work for the investor to do.  From an emotional perspective, leveraging automated investment systems like dollar cost averaging helps remove the stress associated with timing the market – something that regularly plagues novice crypto traders.  To demonstrate the efficacy of a simple DCA strategy, we can look at how investing small amounts in bitcoin over a 10, five and one year period would’ve worked out.  To set up our scenario, we will assume an investor has been investing $1 per week into bitcoin every Monday at 12:00 UTC, using data from www.dcabtc.com.  10 years  Principal invested: $520  Total amount: $371,034  % change: 71,252%  5 years  Principal invested: $260  Total amount: $2,015  % change: 675%  1 year  Principal invested: $52  Total amount: $62  % change: 19.2%  When you look at these numbers, it’s hard to not wish for a time machine in order to go back to the early days of Bitcoin. But the point is, even what may seem like a small amount of money, can turn into a significant amount of money over time. Investing $52 per year for five years turns into over $2,000! If you can do $52 per week or more, the final number grows even larger.  Read More: Is There a ""Best"" Time to Trade Crypto?  Dollar cost averaging and 401(k)s  Dollar cost averaging is a strategy that has been utilized by millions of people in 401(k) accounts. According to Fidelity Investments, the balances in 401(k) accounts hit an all-time high in 2021. 401(k) accounts have unique rules and because of these rules, almost everyone who utilizes a 401(k) as an investment vehicle deploys some sort of DCA strategy.  When an investor uses DCA as their wealth-building strategy, the accounts build up slowly at the beginning and after enough time, there are significant assets in the account.  Dollar cost averaging is appealing to anyone not trying to time the market. It decreases volatility, removes the need for discipline and is uniquely appealing to investors with a limited amount of money to invest upfront.

Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Sliding yuan may add to risk aversion, bringing additional selling pressure to asset prices, including bitcoin. Ether options look cheap.  Chartist's Corner: Bitcoin's three-day chart leans bearish.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Kevin O'Leary, chairman of O'Shares ETFs and ""Shark Tank"" co-host  Cheyenne Ligon, U.S. regulatory reporter, CoinDesk  Lily Zhang, chief financial officer, Huobi  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin (BTC) traded flat as weakness in the Chinese yuan threatened to add to risk-off sentiment in global financial markets.  The top cryptocurrency by market value changed hands above $40,000, having suffered a 2% drop to the psychological support on Thursday after hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sent stocks lower.  The yuan (CNY) fell to 6.5050 per U.S. dollar, the lowest level since July 2021 and was on the way to end the week with a 2.5% loss. That's the biggest single-week percentage decline since August 2015, according to data source TradingView.  ""Check out the Chinese yuan in recent days. Weakening quickly. Lockdowns, slower GDP growth, and the currency of its nearest competitor Japan collapsing. A fast-weakening yuan is a risk-off signal,"" Jeroen Blokland, founder and research head at investment research platform True Insights, tweeted.  According to some observers, including Crescat Capital's portfolio manager Otavio Costa, the yuan could continue to slide as China is facing a major economic downturn and needs to severely devalue its currency.  Previous episodes of yuan devaluation injected significant volatility into traditional markets. For instance, the S&P 500 fell 6.2% in August 2015, hitting a 10-month low as the yuan depreciated by 2.5%. Stocks faced similar turbulence during three months to January 2016 as the yuan's depreciation gathered pace.  Bitcoin's strengthening correlation to stocks makes it vulnerable to a yuan-induced shake-off on Wall Street. At press time, futures tied to the S&P 500 pointed to a negative open. The index fell nearly 1.5% on Thursday.  Historically, before 2020, bitcoin has put in a positive performance during bouts of yuan weakness. Perhaps, Chinese investors diversified into bitcoin to hedge against fiat currency volatility. However, they may have a tough time doing so today, given China has banned bitcoin.  Retail interest in bitcoin is dwindling  Data from Google Trends shows search value for worldwide query bitcoin has dropped to 17, the lowest since mid-2020, having peaked above 70 a year ago.  Google Trends is a widely used tool to gauge general or retail interest in trending topics. A value of 100 represents peak retail interest often observed at market tops.  The latest low reading suggests the general population has lost interest and is no longer scanning the web for information about the top cryptocurrency.

The capital will be used for further platform development and building out the engineering and development team.  “We as a company are a technology platform that facilitates transactions between borrowers and lenders,” said Flowty co-founder Michael Levy in an interview with CoinDesk.  “Because it’s peer-to-peer, and because of how we set up our platform, we can provide our services to people without them needing to go through strict regulatory concepts,” explained Levy, adding:  “So our platform can be used by anyone – people who are traditionally unbankable, people who are in regions where they don’t have a robust financial system.”  Borrowers create a listing on the Flowty marketplace for their NFT and include the desired loan amount, rate and duration. Lenders choose what assets are attractive to them and deploy the capital, earning yield during the loan period and receiving the asset if the borrower defaults.  Flowty takes a fee from each loan that’s funded and essentially holds onto the asset until the loan duration is complete.  Flowty loans can be denominated in Flow blockchain stablecoins FUSD and tUSDT. The platform recently added support for Flow’s native FLOW token and the USDC stablecoin.  Top Shot whale  Levy came to crypto after a passion for sports memorabilia led to him being one of the first large investors in NBA Top Shot from Dapper Labs, which is also the creator of the Flow blockchain. Dapper was a participant in the Flowty funding round alongside Stermion, Tiny VC, Luno Expeditions and Red Beard Ventures.  “The peer-to-peer loan marketplace is the first core feature we built, but we’re working on a number of others,” Levy said. “Our more macro company vision is to be a kind of forefront to the financialization of NFTs.”  Read more: Michael Levy: How to Turn Your NFT Into a Loan  Levy is speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus festival in June.

In 2021 alone, more than $22 billion was spent on those nifty jpegs, and the market looks set for even greater prosperity in the coming years. However, in the same year, crypto and NFT investors lost nearly $14 billion worth of digital assets to crypto scammers. Crypto scams come in various guises. They could come in the form of rug pulls, where purported developers promise to deliver NFTs to prospective clients but later make off with the funds collected for the project without fulfilling their promises. Scams could also come in the form of phishing emails purportedly announcing new NFT airdrops. They could also come in the form of &apos;wash trading,&apos; better known as pump and dump, where a series of trades are used to artificially inflate the value of an NFT and make it seem like the increase in value is the result of organic interest.

Stripe (STRIP) will initially support payouts in stablecoin USDC (USDC-USD), a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, the company said. And the payouts will take place over the Polygon (MATIC-USD) network given its low transaction fees and speed. Additional crypto-based rails and payout currencies will be supported over time, the company added.

Starting from 21 October 2019, the XTZ price moved within the trend growth channel. The global trend line has withstood the attacks of sellers for 3 years. However, since January 2022, sellers have made a very successful attempt to take control of the global trend line. https://www.tradingview.com/x/mKieslyg/ At the time of writing, there is a consolidation on a weekly timeframe. It is in this consolidation that market participants decide the fate of the global growth trend. The main critical range is $3. It is below this mark that sellers cannot close any weekly candles from January 2022. Given the fact that the trading volume has decreased over the past 4 months, sellers do not have the strength to put pressure on the price. But, buyers are afraid to start a growth trend. It is at such an indefinite time that there is a chance to buy XTZ cryptocurrency with low risks. If sellers manage to take control of the $3 range, then we do not recommend investing in XTZ. In this case, there is a risk of continuing to fall to $2.

The funding came two weeks after CertiK announced an $88 million round led by Insight Partners at a $2 billion valuation.  CertiK is profitable and hasn’t touched the capital from its last fundraise, Ronghui Gu, CertiK founder and CEO, told CoinDesk in an interview.  The funding establishes partnerships with two global investing giants that can provide connections to traditional companies who want to enter the Web 3 space.  CertiK marked the first time the venture arm of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank invested in a Web 3 security company.  Read more: Blockchain Security Firm CertiK Just Raised $88M, SEC Docs Show  Blockchain security lapses have made headlines this year and led to over $1 billion in losses. In February, blockchain bridge Wormhole lost $326 million in an exploit. Last month, Ronin Network, the infrastructure under popular play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, suffered a $625 million breach. The Beanstalk stablecoin protocol then became the second notable attack in a month and lost $182 million.  Headquartered in New York City, CertiK offers a set of end-to-end security solutions that can make the company a one-stop shop for customers. Products include code auditing, threat monitoring and asset tracing. The company is currently developing new products.  The security service was founded in 2018 by Gu, a computer science professor at Columbia University, and Yale University professor Zhong Shao.  CertiK holds more than 60% of the market for Web 3 companies who have used a third-party security service, said Gu. However, roughly 90% of companies in the space have never used such a service, which Gu finds “really scary.”  The increasing complexity of Web 3 applications between the smart contracts and layer 2 technology used to scale the project call for complex cyber defense, said Gu.  Security services aren’t easy to find for new Web 3 projects due to the limited number of providers and the often high costs. CertiK wants to scale its security auditing and verification solutions to make them available to even small Web 3 companies.  “We really want to scale this business to all the players in the blockchain and Web 3 industries,” Gu explained.

These digital assets are welcoming the general population into the crypto space, with celebrities, athletes, and billionaires getting an opportunity to connect with their fans. While the &apos;NFT&apos; buzzword has been overused across mainstream media and social media platforms, many investors and holders of NFTs do not understand what NFTs are and why they were created. I could go as far as assuming that even the experts in the crypto space today don&apos;t necessarily fully understand what NFTs are used for (minus digital art and collectible items) and what the future holds for this budding industry. In this article, we remove any fog surrounding the space and explain the widespread use cases for NFTs, the projects working in the NFT space and what the future holds for the space. Understanding Non-fungible Tokens (NFTS) Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are digital tokens that are built on the blockchain and used to represent ownership of unique assets. Via NFTs users can show immutable ownership of assets such as art, music, videos, collectibles, and even title deeds. The differentiating factor between NFTs and traditional data records is that NFTs can only have one owner at a time, secured by the blockchain, meaning no one can modify the record of ownership, or create a copy of the NFT.

In 2021, Saunders was accused of failing to repay debts and investing cash, according to a series of charges. Those who were harmed alleged that Saunders owed them money in Bitcoin (BTC). This prompted an Australian media outlet to look into the matter and come to the conclusion that the influencer owed as much as $7 million. Ziv Himmelfarb, the CEO of Nuggets News, filed a $350,000 lawsuit against him, seeking damages for unpaid loans. Himmelfarb claimed to have invested 4 BTC, 30 ETH, and $50,000 in stablecoins. As a result of Saunders&apos; failure to react, a default judgment was entered, compelling Saunders to compensate the investor for his losses. Aside from that, the influencer has been chastised for a failed Decentraland-based project launch. The crypto influencer had raised funds on the Decentraland platform for a virtual headquarters.

Past Performance of COMP COMP coin price action shows a sideways trend between the 50 and 100-day EMAs and a double top breakout.

42423476,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2a6Bh,1650620922,Crypto Traders Find Ether Options Attractive as 'Implied Volatility' Slides,"The ether (ETH) spot market lull has traders focusing on derivatives, with some finding options cheaper in this low implied volatility environment.  Barring a brief spike to $3,200 early this week, ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has mostly traded in the range of $2,400 to $3,200 since late January.  The combination of directionless price action and explosive growth of the decentralized finance option vaults has pushed ether's three-month daily implied volatility (IV) or expectations for price turbulence to 3.5%, the lowest since November 2020, according to data provided by Skew.  The implied volatility is undervalued compared to its lifetime average of 4.9%, but it is also significantly cheap compared to the three-month daily historical volatility, currently at 4.1%. The spread between the historical volatility and implied volatility is the widest it has been since July 2021.  In other words, options, both call and put, are cheap. Implied volatility is one of the critical factors determining the prices of options, which are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while a put offers the right to sell.  ""In my opinion, it makes sense to buy options [call and put] given volatility is low,"" Samneet Chepal, quantitative analyst at the digital asset investment firm LedgerPrime told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""The IV is quite cheap largely due to the choppy market action, which results in traders being more complacent in selling vol plus the impact of systematic selling from the DeFi option vaults.""  Buying options – call and put – tracking cheap implied volatility essentially means taking a long position on volatility. It's a direction-neutral bet that would make money as long as there are price swings. The implied volatility is mean-reverting and positively impacts the option's price.  While spot and futures markets allow traders to take directional bets, options open an additional dimension of volatility trading. However, it's not without risks. For example, the implied volatility can stay cheap for a prolonged period before bouncing to the mean, and options lose money as the time for expiration nears. It's called theta decay in options parlance. So, traders buying volatility via long call/put positions can lose money if the expected bump up in implied volatility doesn't materialize before expiration.  ""While options look cheap, there's a risk that we continue seeing choppy price action for some time hence resulting in the [options] premium being decayed,"" Chepal said, adding that selling a strategy called a reverse iron condorcould mitigate risk associated with continued low-volatility sideways price action.  The reverse iron condor is a four-part strategy established for net debit. Both the potential profit and maximum risk are limited, as seen below.  ""One alternative might be to sell iron condors which can result in lower theta decay in the case vol continues staying low,"" Chepal said.  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset management firm Blofin, said, ""the whole of April is a relatively good time to bet on volatility [with calls and puts], but right now, it's preferable to use a combination of call options to go long on volatility. That's because puts appear relatively overpriced.""  Indeed, put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls, show puts are drawing a higher price than calls across all time frames, including the six-month expiry. Traders have been buying outs off late. ""We've also seen large demand for low delta [lower strike] puts, particularly in ETH, across the expiries out till December with strikes as low as 1,000. This could also be a play on further delays with the ETH Merge,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast.  Ardern cited a combination of call ratio spread – buy a call near the spot price and sell two at a higher level – and a short futures position as a preferred strategy. ""If IV rises and the market falls, you will get a higher profit for a relatively less cost,"" Ardern said. ""Compared with buying strangles, the cost of building this strategy can be relatively lower while achieving similar benefits.""  Straddles and strangles are widely used to profit from an impending volatility spike. These strategies involve buying the same expiry call and put options in equal numbers.  Options trading is far more complex than trading in the spot market or buying/selling futures. Before setting up a position, seasoned traders study the so-called option greeks like delta, gamma, theta and vega. This can be a daunting task to the uninitiated and dabbling with options without the necessary know-how can lead to significant losses.  Correction (13:26 UTC): LedgerPrime's Samneet Chepal cited the reverse iron condor option strategy as a better alternative to outright call and put option buys. The previous version of the article erroneously mentioned short iron condor as the preferred strategy and carried the wrong payoff diagram.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/22/crypto-traders-find-ether-options-attractive-as-implied-volatility-slides,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47cdc2633ad1fdf25ddd37d576c6f55697676b7d-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cyprus-based Sand Vegas Casino Club said that holders of the Gambling Apes NFTs can participate in profit-sharing from the proceeds of the casinos.  In an update on its discord, BlackyJefferson21, a community lead for the project, said the team is working with lawyers and has reached out to Texas and Alabama in ""good faith"" to discuss the next steps.  Another admin said the team intends to comply with all laws and regulations but ""was previously not subject to any registration requirements, and had not been contacted by any governmental organization regarding registration requirements.""  The team forecasted proceeds of up to $24,480 from the “Gambler” NFTs and up to $81,000 per year from the higher-end “Golden Gambler” NFTs.  ""It appears the main issue with the 'Gambler' NFTs is that there was an explicit expectation of profit sharing, which appears to run afoul of the [Securities and Exchange Commission's] Howey test,"" said Christopher LaVigne, a partner in the litigation and arbitration team of international law firm Withers.  LaVigne said that if the SEC determines an NFT marketplace is providing a trading platform for securities, it will most certainly take the view that the marketplace is operating as an unlicensed exchange.  OpenSea did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk by press time.  The NFTs are now listed at LooksRare and continue to be traded, according to data from Etherscan.

It controls the currency flow by either injecting or withdrawing funds from the economy. All of the money in circulation is printed by the central banks. Yet, there is talk that the bankruptcy of central banks is possibly going to happen. Peter Thiel, a renowned investor who is the founder and chairman of Palantir Technologies inc, sees it happening sooner than later. And that will most probably bring the adoption of Bitcoin sooner than expected. So just how can a central bank go bankrupt? Read on to find out. Brief on How the Central Bank Works Before printing any currency, the central bank must have a set intended target cause of action within the economy. The most common aim is usually to either reduce or induce inflation. Another important aim is usually to devalue the currency, maintain its current valuation or increase its value. There are two key options to affect the two primary variables: raising and lowering interest rates. Such a step reduces or increases the money supply respectively by affecting the cost of borrowing. The second option is quantitative easing. It involves directly injecting money into the economy through the purchase of bank securities. This money is made simply. The reverse consists in selling government securities to the banks to reduce the money supply.

42423477,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2a69h,1650615320,"Retail Interest in Bitcoin Is Dwindling, Google Data Suggests","Bitcoin’s (BTC) price surge to as much as $69,000 last year and a range above $40,000 this year has failed to attract continual interest from retail crowds, search data from Google Trends suggests.  Worldwide searches for bitcoin have reached mid-2020 levels as of April 22, 2022, with readings of 17 for the week of April 17-April 23. This is a relative drop from May 2021’s readings of 76.  Google Trends allows users to compare the relative volume of searches. This, however, does not mean the total number of searches for that term is decreasing, but just means its popularity is decreasing compared to other searches. A line trending downward means that a search term's popularity relative to other popular terms is decreasing.  Data suggests most searches for bitcoin originate from Nigeria, followed by El Salvador and Austria. These search queries are relative to other terms or keywords searched in those regions, meaning Nigerians searched for bitcoin more than they searched for other keywords, but this wasn’t necessarily more than overall search figures from, say, the U.S.  But despite the apparent waning interest in bitcoin, some analysts say retail crowds are gravitating towards newer sectors and markets within the crypto space, such as tokens of decentralized finance (DeFi) or layer 1 blockchains such as Solana and Avalanche.  “Bitcoin has risen in price several times, with its investment threshold becoming higher for new users,"" explained Johnny Lyu, CEO of Kucoin, in a Telegram message. ""But many new cryptocurrencies known as altcoins have appeared since, which, according to users, can be more attractive as investments.""  Lyu added the quick presence and popularity of meme coins have gradually shifted users' attention from bitcoin in comparison to the past few years.  Egor Volotkovich, the executive director of cross-chain solutions EVODeFi, seconded that sentiment. Decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, “and blockchain gaming are areas of interest that are now enticing investors across the board,” he said.  “Retail investors are more interested in exploring these other innovations the blockchain ecosystem now offers, which explains the declining search trends irrespective of the price differentials between now and the past two years,” Volotkovich added.  Meanwhile, some like Vasja Zupan, president of crypto exchange Matrix, argue the search data does not represent interest from institutional investors.  “Google Trends do not reflect institutional and professional interest. And I believe that current prices reflect those groups' interest and entering the market more than pure retail,” he said in an email to CoinDesk. “With bitcoin maturing we will see a less retail impact, with exception of times of peak bull cycles and more influence from institutional demand,” Zupan added.  Firms like business analytics maker MicroStrategy (MSTR) and electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA) have purchased billions of dollars worth of bitcoin in the past two years, unlike previous cycles in 2018 and earlier.

42423472,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2a65h,1650613367,Crypto Taxes Fall Under EU Lawmakers' Gaze,"After controversial laws to restrict privacy in crypto transactions, and even flirting with banning bitcoin (BTC) altogether, the European Parliament is now considering what blockchain technologies could mean for taxes.  On April 25, lawmakers will discuss how to tighten up tax laws and procedures for the Web 3 era – and a draft report prepared by Portuguese member of the European Parliament Lídia Pereira suggests national tax authorities could start swapping data on individuals’ crypto-asset holdings.  That call is, perhaps, no surprise. Existing European Union rules on administrative cooperation allow similar exchanges of information about bank accounts to stop overseas holdings being kept secret from the taxman, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), guardians of international tax norms, is currently consulting on whether that should extend to crypto.  Snooping  Pereira’s proposal isn’t a problem when you’re talking about big corporations, but could be a troubling privacy invasion if it implicates your regular crypto saver, one lawmaker involved in the report has told CoinDesk in an interview.  “When you have a well-established business which is on the border between the traditional financial system and crypto, then I think it's fine to have a certain overview or supervision from the authorities, and to share this information”, said Mikuláš Peksa, a member of the Czech Pirate Party, which promotes digitalization and online rights.  That shouldn’t mean extra snooping or enforcement activity against regular people, though, he adds.  “Our tax system, as it stands, is very much focused on chasing the smaller players in order to force them to pay each and every euro,” he said, while “the bigger players are generally using more or less legal ways to optimize their taxes.”  Alongside the risks of tax evasion, lawmakers also seem interested in the blockchain opportunity for taxes. Public ledgers could offer a new way to automate tax collection, ensuring people pay what they owe without lots of form filling.  Instead of submitting returns to the tax authorities, “you can tell them the address of your wallet, and they can just do everything else,” Peksa said, adding that, in terms of proving which transactions you’d made, blockchain networks verified by multiple users are “much more accountable than whatever any bank could give you.”  Modernizing conservative tax administrations presents its own challenges, he admits. But lawmakers may have been inspired by a presentation they were given in November, at which tax lawyers said Web 3 technology could improve efficiency and cut fraud.  Blockchain tech can ensure taxes are taken out at the source, such as on the payroll or when share dividends are distributed – but also used in trickier applications like transfer pricing, the complex process for valuing multinational companies’ liabilities across different jurisdictions.  Value-added tax, the levy on day-to-day sales imposed throughout the bloc, could even be replaced by a less fraud-prone virtual token in time, Robert Müller of law firm Flick Gocke Schaumburg told lawmakers.  Pereira’s draft urges the European Commission to “assess how to leverage blockchain technologies and to prevent tax fraud and avoidance,” and even develop an EU-wide infrastructure to support it.  Online influencers?  In practice, what lawmakers say may make little difference. Unlike areas like anti-money laundering law or crypto license requirements, the European Parliament can’t amend tax legislation, but only provide advice.  As such, lawmakers’ views seem unlikely to ideal with more substantive issues within the EU crypto tax system. Even in relatively accepting jurisdictions like Germany, the tax treatment can create a headache.  A 2020 OECD report shows that different countries, even within the EU, take different views as to how to tax income from mining, or when one crypto asset is exchanged for another.  That divergence can make life complicated for those working in multiple jurisdictions – but it also offers a potential bonus for the sector, as EU nations can vie with each other to offer the most crypto-friendly environment.  Advice from the parliament seems unlikely to change that arrangement. While many EU member countries want to fight tax-dodging, they also jealously guard their room for manoeuvre in setting their own tax policy. And, under EU procedures, any country can veto a tax proposal it doesn’t like, preventing it from passing into law.

Sandeep Nailwal, who is one of the crypto industry’s most prominent Indian-born entrepreneurs and who now lives in Dubai, told CoinDesk that the creation of a collective authority composed of representatives from the Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Goods and Services Tax Council and Finance Ministry would encourage projects like his own to set up shop in the country.  “The finance ministry should be the one heading this task force, and every other institution should be given a clear mandate that no crypto case shall be handled locally. It should only be handled by the central crypto task force,” Nailwal said.  According to Nailwal, those steps are needed to secure a fair environment for dialogue and ensure progress between blockchain advocates and monetary and national security advocates.  Nailwal said that different government or enforcement institutions in different regions of India are all now actively involved in crypto and they each have their own definition of what crypto is. The technology requires a dedicated team, he said.  “What they see is that crazy value is being created and try to see how it can be taxed in India. That’s needed, too. But to expect each nodal member of each regulatory body to truly understand this new technology in their busy schedules is very difficult. Hence we need one single highly empowered division, which has singular responsibility to interact, learn and enforce regulations on this fairly niche industry” Nailwal said.  Nailwal said it was primarily regulatory uncertainty that has kept Polygon out of India, and he has stated previously that although the co-founders are originally from India, Polygon is “not an Indian entity” but a “decentralized network with no headquarters.” He also said that Polygon is an entity registered in the British Virgin Islands.  “Polygon never set up in India from day zero,” Nailwal said.

The company aims to present a coin with the implementation capabilities of Bitcoin, however, expanding on the opportunities for DeFi and DApp developers to use the coin. Bitcoin Gold is a cryptocurrency with Bitcoin fundamentals, mined on common GPUs instead of specialty ASICs. What is Bitcoin Gold (BTG)? Bitcoin Gold is an open-sourced protocol that allows developers to participate in the governance and development of the blockchain freely.

However, unlike BitMEX which offers perpetual contracts, Binance&apos;s futures have expiry dates which traders must consider when trading on this platform. With careful consideration of supply and demand fundamentals and the use of stop-losses, swing trading futures on Binance can be very profitable. In fact, you can use futures to leverage your existing crypto holdings without actually buying more crypto! Let me show you how it works… Diversify Your Portfolio While many swing traders focus on finding and selling undervalued assets, others look for overvalued ones and buy them at a lower price. This strategy requires technical and fundamental analysis to determine which assets to trade. While this strategy can be profitable, it is not for everyone. Using multiple asset classes and sectors is essential. Diversifying your portfolio is important if you want to achieve consistent, long-term trading success. It helps protect your capital, manage your risk, enables you to withstand market volatility, and realize gains from only a few positions. Although, it is very tempting to buy a single asset and hold it for a long period. Instead, you should diversify your portfolio to avoid losing a significant amount of money.
