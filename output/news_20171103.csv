42380004,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Lf3B,1509744656,China's Bitcoin Exchanges Are Shifting Business Models,"Some of China's top bitcoin exchanges are now shifting to the over-the-counter (OTC) market in the wake of a crackdown by regulators in the country.  In announcements made on Oct. 31, both OKEx and Huobi Pro said they will introduce peer-to-peer trading platforms that support fiat currency transactions, including the Chinese yuan, as an alternative for the country's domestic cryptocurrency investors.  Based in Hong Kong, the two exchanges had previously provided solely crypto-to-crypto trading since being founded by their respective parent exchanges, Beijing-headquartered OKCoin and Huobi. They will now pivot toward a combination of the existing structure and the direct, peer-to-peer model.  According to OKEx, the yuan is currently the only fiat currency that is available on its P2P platform, noting that it has seen increasing demand from Chinese investors since the exchange crackdown.  Lennix Lai, financial market director at OKEx, said the platform has received around 8,000 user applications for account registration since the new service's launch on November 1.  Lin Li, CEO of Huobi, said in his latest announcement that, besides the P2P platform on Huobi Pro, the company is also eyeing an expansion to overseas markets. The firm is currently in the process of setting up an exchange platform in South Korea in order to compete with local marketplaces like Bithumb.  The news follows months of growing scrutiny by Chinese regulators that led to all major bitcoin exchanges in the country, including OKCoin, Huobi, BTC China, and ViaBTC, to suspend order book trading of digital assets against the yuan.

42380009,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Lf5h,1509742811,Trust No One: Ethereum Smart Contract Security Is Advancing,"""Everyone here is a target for attack. Be paranoid.""  That's how Ethereum Foundation security lead Martin Swende ended his deep-dive lecture on smart contract security at Devcon3 yesterday. At this point, he's witnessed his fair share of attacks on ethereum and wants the community to know what they're getting into.  There was The DAO hack, where millions of dollars in ether was stolen due to a smart contract bug. There was the time ethereum transactions slowed because of an unknown attacker – this on one of Swende's first days working on the protocol, no less. And then just a few months ago, ethereum client Parity lost $30 million after being hacked.  And that's not to mention all the bitcoin-related hacks.  With this, developers point out that – as revolutionary as ethereum can and could be – there's still a lot of kinks to iron out, one of the reasons the open-source projet's flagship conference saw such a focus on security on its second day, with developers and academics alike releasing new tools to take smart contract security a step further.  Despite these major attacks, though, developers are optimistic about where smart contract security is heading.  RSK Labs chief scientist and cryptocurrency security consultant Sergio Demian Lerner told CoinDesk:  ""The whole ecosystem is maturing in terms of security.""  The right tools  While there are different pieces of ethereum that need securing, the second day of Devcon focused on smart contracts, likely because vulnerabilities in these mechanism's code are the genesis of people losing money.  Manuel Aráoz, CTO of blockchain security company Zeppelin, called 2016 the ""dark ages"" of ethereum security, but, like others, noted that things have been improving.  For one, ""upgrading"" smart contracts once they're live on ethereum is a huge open problem. Unlike with more traditional software, if there's a bug in a piece of smart contract code, and it's written without safeguards, there's no way developers can just update the code.  But Araoz and his team at Zeppelin have been working on a helpful tool, recently unveiling a new OS project that looks to make it easier to tinker with code that's already up and running.  ""If we have a bug or need to improve the program, we can do so. It can be used to fix production code,"" he said.  While it doesn't solve the upgrading problem completely, the project provides a new tool – and these additions to the ethereum developer toolbox are acknowledged widely as moving smart contract security ahead.  Another project unveiled at the event, Securify is touted as a ""push-button security auditing tool."" Revealed in a session titled ""Not Your Grandma's Smart Contract Verification,"" it offers an easy interface for developers to plug in smart contracts and check for certain types of bugs.  During the session, ETH Zurich Software Reliability Lab researcher Quentin Hibon said Securify is a strong security guarantee.  With developments like this, according to Lerner, everything is headed in the right direction.  Ethereum's virtual machine has been improved on in terms of security, he said. Formal verification has been added, which uses math proofs to detect whether smart contracts work properly, he continued. And ethereum's main smart contract language, Solidity has matured, so now many mistakes are corrected at the Solidity level, he concluded.  'Always worried'  This isn't to say there won't still be problems with smart contracts going forward. Almost every security talk of the day ended with a call to action, a warning or a list of open problems facing the second largest cryptocurrency protocol by market cap.  RSK's Lerner, for one, mentioned that he takes apart initial coin offering (ICO) contracts in his spare time and spots many obvious bugs. The fact that token issuers are now soliciting the help of security experts to audit their smart contract code is a good sign, he said.  And researchers from a handful of universities are also trying to tweak the incentive structures around bugs, in an effort to encourage hackers to report vulnerabilities instead of exploiting them.  As reported by CoinDesk yesterday, Hydra riffs off the traditional bug bounty model: programmatically offering hackers more in the way of rewards to inform developers about a bug than exploiting the bug would pay out.  But many of these projects are still in the early stages.  Ethereum – and cryptocurrencies in general – remain a sort of hacker's paradise.  ""The hacking scene has changed tremendously. The revenue stream for hackers was with botnets for denial of service attacks; that’s pretty difficult to build. Now, after crypto, it’s so monetizeable, and there are low risks,"" said the Ethereum Foundation's Swende.  This brings new challenges blockchain developers must prepare for, and the first step, according to Swende, is to remain vigilant.  He stated:  ""I'm always worried.""

According to the Dragonchain site, roughly 30,521 ether and 622.47 bitcoin were contributed during the two-stage token sale, which began with a pre-sale in August and ended with the conclusion of a public sale that concluded earlier this week. The pre-sale itself raised approximately $1.4 million (152.25 BTC and 2357.53 ETH).  In statements, representatives for the firm said that the funding will go toward development as well as establishing a market for the firm's Dragon token.  ""Our goal was to determine market price of a Dragon and raise enough to deliver our roadmap,"" CEO Joe Roets told CoinDesk in an email.  Dragonchain will distribute all of the 238,421,940 coins designated for the public sale proportionally to the value in bitcoin of all the funds contributed in the public offering (contributions in ether will be valued as bitcoin at the exchange rate of the time of contribution). The distribution will occur after audits are complete.  There were 5,388 transactions in the sale, with a median contribution of $290.77 (the largest was $1,046,754.33), the startup said, though it added it doesn't have a definite figure on the total number of contributors.  The sale was open to anyone in the world, and it did not limit the sale to accredited investors nor require any form of identification to participate, according to the site’s FAQ.  As Business Insider reported, Dragonchain started as an internal project at Disney in 2014, until the company dropped the project in 2016 and open-sourced its work.

RecycleToCoin – the rewarding of recyclers by exchanging waste for BCDC tokens which they can then use to purchase other currencies or cryptocurrencies.3. FoodTrax – a system that enables consumers to track where their foods come from, so that they can make more informed decisions about buying locally grown foods.The BCDC tokens and funding projectsThere is a total supply of one billion BCDC tokens, with a certain number going to fund each of the three projects. To fund Ecochain and FoodTrax, 250 million tokens will be sold in exchange for Ethereum cryptocurrency units (ETH) – at an initial fixed rate of one ETH to 400 BCDC tokens. These Ethereums will then be sold for fiat currency to spend on projects. To fund RecycleToCoin, 250 million tokens will be exchanged with participants for plastics and aluminium containers.For investors of BCDC tokensThe pre-sale of 125 million BCDC tokens will end on 20th November and, after this, there will be a main sale until 27th November. To all investors that keep their coins, they will receive an additional 20% of their token amount every year for five years. BCDC has created a chance for investors who missed out on the rise of Bitcoin to participate in the benefits of cryptocurrency. However, perhaps those who missed it weren't ever going to invest anyway and will overlook this opportunity.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | ICO,,0,0,Crypto Daily,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/using-cryptocurrencies-help-save-environment,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15989373.jpeg

42380007,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Lf8D,1509729611,Tezos Founders Sued for Securities Fraud in Potential Class Action,"A lawsuit seeking class action status has been filed in California against the founders and promoters of the controversial Tezos blockchain project.  The lawsuit represents the latest twist in the ongoing spat between Tezos founders Kathleen and Arthur Breitman and Johann Gevers, the head of the Tezos Foundation, a non-profit created to promote and support development of the project. The Breitmans accused Gevers of self-dealing, with Gevers alleging in turn that the Breitmans were seeking to assassinate his character and attempting to usurp control of the foundation.  That internal power struggle broke into public view earlier this month, stoking criticism of the project and raising questions about when the Tezos network would go live. It came months after the project raised a record $232 million in a token sale – the proceeds of which are now part of the dispute. The tokens have yet to be issued.  Submitted on Oct. 25 in the San Francisco branch of the Superior Court of California, the lawsuit names multiple defendants, including the Breitmans and Gevers.  Dynamic Ledger Solutions, Inc., a Delaware-based company owned by the Breitmans, the Tezos Foundation, and Strange Brew Strategies, a public relations firm that promoted the project ahead of its ICO, are also named as defendants.  The suit, filed by San Diego-based law firm Taylor-Copeland Law on behalf of plaintiff and Tezos ICO contributor Andrew Baker, alleges that the defendants violated U.S. securities law through the token sale. Specifically, the defendants are being accused of selling unregistered securities, committing securities fraud, false advertising and unfair competition (""by making material misrepresentations and omissions"").  When reached for comment, Baker Marquart attorney Brian Klein, who is representing the Breitmans, said that that his clients planned to “aggressively” fight the lawsuit.  ""This lawsuit is without merit for a host of reasons. Kathleen and Arthur Breitman, who are brilliant entrepreneurs and visionaries, are going to aggressively defend themselves. They should never have been sued,"" Klein told CoinDesk.  ""As a general matter, the Foundation does not comment on potential litigation,"" Gevers said when contacted by email.  Strange Brew Strategies declined to comment when reached.  'Mess' ahead?  How the lawsuit shakes out – including whether it receives a class-action certification – remains to be seen, given the early stages of the case.  Even still, observers like Anderson Kill lawyer Stephen Palley say that the lawsuit could drag on regardless of the long-term fortunes of the Tezos network itself. The allegation that state securities laws (not just federal ones) were violated represents ""a significant area of risk for ICO promoters"" in general, Palley said.  Palley also suggested that the lawsuit may not be the only one filed in relation to the controversy, speculating that ""copycat"" litigation could emerge as time goes on.  ""In short, it's a complicated mess. I doubt that it will be resolved quickly, even if tokens are issued quickly. It is unclear what impact that this will have on Tezos' development,"" Palley told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It's definitely not a great development for a new venture.""

42380008,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Lf9T,1509724825,UK Ministry of Justice: Blockchain Could Help Verify Crime Evidence,"An official for the U.K. Ministry of Justice believes blockchain could help the government secure and verify digital evidence.  Alistair Davidson, a technical architecture lead at the Ministry, published a blog post Thursday which outlined a notable blockchain use case related to law enforcement: using the tech to create records for officer-worn camera footage.  While Davidson's blog post is largely hypothetical, it's a noteworthy exploration of how blockchain could find its way to being used by public-sector entities like the Justice Ministry. He noted that such utilization would be especially useful in court, particularly if the prosecution wanted to use the ledger record to prove the video’s authenticity, according to the post.  Davidson wrote:  ""This property of distributing trust could be genuinely transformational in situations where public trust of government might not be taken for granted.""  The ledger would not actually store the video, he stated. Rather, it would contain a hash of the video’s data and metadata, as well as a listing of its location within the government’s storage area.  If the videos are uploaded to a publicly available cloud storage, “the blockchain would be readable by anyone, anywhere - but only writable by the police,” Davidson writes.  In a technical overview published by the Ministry of Justice, the government explains that while a blockchain is immutable, it can only verify the assets stored after they are listed.

After the cryptocurrency printed a fresh record high of $7,454.05 on Coindesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) earlier today, BTC has failed twice to hold above $7,400 mark.  The price action, when viewed on the technical chart, shows a ""textbook"" bull market exhaustion pattern – the first legitimate sign of a tired market after days of solid rally.  4-hour chart  The chart above shows:  Doji candle formed at previous record high.  Overbought RSI.  Potential bearish doji reversal and bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence.  Formed when the open and close for a stock or tradeable asset are virtually the same, a doji candle is a neutral pattern, often read as a sign of exhaustion if it occurs at the top or bottom of the trend. On the chart above, the doji candle has appeared at the record high, suggesting the possibility of bull market exhaustion.  However, only a bearish follow-through (next candle is negative) would signal bullish-to-bearish trend change. A bearish doji reversal would be confirmed if the current 4-hour candle ends with losses (i.e. is red).  The story doesn't end here, though. A bearish price RSI divergence would be confirmed as well, if the current 4-hour candle is red. Bearish price RSI divergence occurs when prices print higher highs, while the RSI prints lower highs.  On the above chart, we see higher highs on the price chart: $7,445 (yesterday's high) and $7,450 (today's high), yet, the RSI is yet to confirm a lower high. If the current 4-hour candle drops into the red, the RSI would form a lower high and thus, a bearish price-RSI divergence would be confirmed.  View  Confirmation of the bearish doji reversal and bearish price RSI divergence could yield a much needed healthy correction to the $6,700–$6,400 range.

42380000,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Ley9,1509718226,Hello Moon: Ethereum Developers Launch Lightweight Dapp Browser,"Despite the booming token market based on its technology, ethereum isn't deviating from its stated goal of becoming a ""world computer.""  In a move that showcases developers are still prioritizing the creation of so-called distributed applications (dapps), a new version of Mist, the original browser designed for ethereum apps, made its debut at Devcon today. Demoed at the Cancun conference, Moon, or Mist-light, is a browser-based rewrite of the software meant to perform similar tasks to the desktop version, though in a way that doesn't require downloading.  Much like Mist, Moon isn't only a browser, it provides an interface for dapp development.  Users can visit an app, safely fork or edit the code, and changes are updated real time on the webpage. This development code is hashed, and then it's shareable, and anyone can plug it into their own Moon browser.  Unlike Mist, which runs on Javascript, Moon operates on its own language that acts as a Javascript compiler, one its developers say allows ethereum dapps to be securely accessed and tested without causing risk to the original code. (Present on the interface, which displays the source code for any dapp accessed via the browser, is an icon that allows for editing.)  Speaking to CoinDesk, ethereum developer Alex Van De Sande explained that the concept behind the feature was to help other software developers ""learn to love the fork."" Hard forks, or software updates, have arguably a bad name in blockchain because they can be complicated to execute safely.  But Van De Sande emphasized that in open-source software design, forks are integral to the overall health of applications, and should be celebrated as part of that diversity.

42380013,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LfEV,1509715805,"Ripple Price Outlook Positive on Korean Volume, Analyst Prediction","Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency has completed the round trip at press time.  The ripple-U.S. dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate jumped to a high of $0.23 at 01:10 UTC today, only to fall back to the session's opening price of $0.21. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.20 and has gained 10.34 percent in the last 24 hours.  But while the gains are in line with action seen in most of the market, social media suggests XRP may be gaining on bullish statements. Making the rounds is one report by Palm Beach Research Group, which suggests the analyst expects the cryptocurrency to outperform in 2018.  A closer look at the charts, however, indicates the rally today may have a more certain cause: Korean desks offering XRP/KRW pairs. Trading volumes on Bithumb, one of the largest exchanges in South Korea, have gone up by 45 percent in the last 24 hours.  Volumes on exchanges offering XRP/BTC pairs have increased as well.  That said, the volume pop was short lived as market attention shifted back to bitcoin. Still, the price action analysis in XRP favors the bulls.  Ripple chart  The above chart shows:  The sell-off from the post-Swell event high of $0.30 has run out of steam around 0.18, courtesy of strong rebound from sub-$0.18 levels seen yesterday.  The relative strength index (RSI) seems to have found a bottom around 27.00 levels.  XRP has formed a rounded-bottom pattern over the last four months.  View  A convincing move above the 50-day moving average (MA) level of $0.2107 would open doors for $0.2652 (Aug. 31 high) and $0.30 (Oct. 16 high).  On the downside, only a break below the previous day's low of $0.1742 would revive the post-Swell sell-off and could yield a drop to $0.15 levels.

But during the London Blockchain Summit this week, Nicola Robinson, senior strategic marketing manager at the U.K.'s Royal Mint, which owns 5.4 percent of the global bullion market, did just that.  Sure, Robinson had handed the bar over to audience members (it was eventually recovered), but the stunt was designed to give a sense of the difficulty inherent in tracking and managing gold, and to set up how a blockchain might relieve some of that.  While the blockchain can't, obviously, store the physical gold, it has – through the group's Royal Mint Gold (RMG) blockchain – proved helpful in managing the ownership of the commodity.  Originally revealed in November 2016 as a way to provide a reliable record of gold ownership and the near instantaneous sale of the precious metal, at the event, Robinson revealed that the first test transaction on the RMG blockchain was completed Aug. 2, with a genesis block that includes a picture of the developers.  Robinson said:  ""It's simple, it's so simple, it's just a digital representation of real gold. The most exciting thing about RMG is that it's live, it's out there, it's working.""  And while the blockchain – which was created in partnership with financial market giant CME Group using wallet startup BitGo's technology – is not yet open to the public, it has currently verified more than 50,000 blocks, Robinson said.  In her eyes, the blockchain could help manage smaller amounts (such as a single ounce) of gold, which some believe would lower the barrier to entry for potential gold investors and increase the liquidity of the market.  Robinson also used her talk at the blockchain event to hint at the Royal Mint's broader initiatives.  For one, she revealed that the launch of a blockchain-based bullion trading platform was imminent. And touched on the fact that the RMG platform could someday be used to accommodate requests to prove the provenance of gold and, even more broadly, in the provisioning of collateral of global trades.  Currently the Royal Mint is in discussions with potential partners and traders, though Robinson didn't give a specific date the platform would launch.  Robinson minced no words when describing the impact she believes the blockchain will have on gold trading:  ""We think RMG is the start of a global revolution. We think it's a bit of a game changer.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Bitgo.

42379995,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LeuN,1509710421,How Blockchains Will Turn Supply Chains Into Demand Chains,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  In this opinion piece, one of a weekly series of columns, Casey argues that the value blockchain technology offers to supply-chain management will come once other technologies, such as 3D printing, bring major disruption to global manufacturing and delivery networks.      Blockchains are a technology of tomorrow, not today.  That is not an excuse to ignore them, however. On the contrary, the future to which blockchains belong is coming so fast that a failure to properly strategize and to consider the widest range of design possibilities could eventually prove fatal for many businesses.  This is especially so in supply-chain management, a field that deals with the plumbing of the global economy: how a good's production moves sequentially through the manufacturing processes of separately owned businesses before it is delivered to the end-user.  A combination of new technologies – artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, the internet of things, mobile money, digital identity and, most importantly, 3D printing – is poised to seriously disrupt these underlying processes. They'll make manufacturing more responsive and customizable to customer's orders – in effect, turning supply chains into demand chains. But this dynamism will only be realized if they also adopt the kind of decentralized trust mediation model promised by blockchains.  Supply-chain managers are typically found only at big, downstream companies, such as Walmart. These experts have real influence in the management of many consumer brands.  Smaller upstream players occupying spots earlier on in the chain are outgunned by the bigger players and generally can’t influence the activities of others enough to warrant employing a supply-chain manager. Yet, ironically, improved chain transparency and visibility from better supply-chain management would help them gain bargaining power vis-à-vis the big guys.  So, when we hear about supply chain managers giving thought to blockchain solutions to their problems, it's worth remembering where they are coming from: they represent large buyer companies and tend to view their supply chain proprietarily. They see it as an exclusive club over which they control access, one with a clearly defined, existing set of members.  It's a static vision, not a dynamic one, and it's marked by a power imbalance in their favor.  Static vision, static choices  From that perspective, it's understandable –in fact, appropriate – that many are asking why they should bother with the cat-herding challenge of getting their supply-chain partners to jointly create a complicated, costly, multi-node computing network to run a distributed blockchain ledger.  Often they discover they can address many supply-chain information-management problems, including improving the tracking of inventory and work processes, with well-established database tools that already run internally on their company’s servers.  As Gideon Greenspan, CEO of Coin Sciences, has warned, ""If your requirements are fulfilled by today's relational databases, you’d be insane to use a blockchain.""  Firms that operate in supply chains where power is more balanced, where middle-size firms have some clout and too much to lose by submitting information to the centralized control of the biggest player, might instead conclude that a blockchain is useful. A distributed, immutable ledger could help different stakeholders overcome their inherent mistrust of each other, which could boost efficiency and visibility along the chain.  Yet here, too, the scope tends to be limited. Since the supply chain is viewed as a club with pre-existing, pre-approved members, chain managers have a hard time grasping why they would submit their transaction-sharing processes to a fully decentralized network and a permissionless blockchain such as bitcoin or ethereum. They'd much prefer to form a consortium and jointly validate the private distributed ledger.  They see other advantages in private blockchains, too: the permissioned structure allows much more transaction capacity than public blockchains; upgrades can be easily agreed to and trivially implemented; identity, privacy and other natural concerns of businesses can be addressed in ways that public blockchains cannot.  But in an era of rapid technological change that poses an existential threat for legacy businesses, it's unwise to assume a static business environment. Many people know the Kodak story.  There's a risk that a permissioned blockchain, based on a consortium managed by existing, pre-approved suppliers, would evolve into a rigid, gatekeeping entity. Members would be incentivized to limit access to outsiders with competing products and new ideas. And while that might protect the chain members’ margins for a while, it would ultimately render the whole chain less competitive.  It might not be a huge risk now, but, as mentioned, things are changing. Rapidly.  The supply chains of the future will be much more dynamic, flexible and customer-responsive than those of the present. Geography and longstanding relationships will be less of issue. This suggests that supply chain managers should not only be looking at blockchains but also striving for the most open, permissionless model they can handle.  They might not need to adopt bitcoin or ethereum per se; I could even be persuaded that a permissioned network of validators might still preserve a decentralized, competitive landscape if the consortium’s governance rules steadfastly allowed any new supplier to write data to the ledger.  Either way, the bottom line is that openness and permissionlessness are vitally important ideals to strive for, precisely because they encourage competition and innovation.  Decentralized trust  Taken together, new manufacturing technologies such as IoT and 3D-printing contain enormous decentralizing potential. By empowering people and businesses to do more with less, they reduce transaction costs, which means they can break down barriers to entry and challenge the economies of scale that have hitherto advantaged big, centralized companies.  If we can prevent the data-gathering behemoths of the internet 2.0 era from monopolizing them, these tools should help level the playing field. They should open the door to to a wider array of potential producers in the global economy.  But to reach its optimal potential, that decentralized, more horizontal economic structure will also require a decentralized trust model. The cost of having a single company verify the trustworthiness of an ever-widening array of potential business partners will be too high for any supply chain to remain competitive.  Let’s imagine a world in which 3D printing – known as additive manufacturing in the industrial world – is ubiquitous. Now imagine a German auto-parts producer receiving a request for quotes from an Argentine car assembler, a customer it has never previously dealt with, and for delivery in two days. The German company knows it’s highly likely that competing manufacturers in the U.S., Brazil, India and South Korea have also received offers. The only way to meet the order is to tap a hitherto untested 3D-printing company in Buenos Aires.  How can it trust this supplier? The time and cost of applying current due diligence, credentialing and approval procedures to onboard this company into an approved list of suppliers would take too long and cost too much money. It would leave the German company outcompeted for the job.  As supply chains start to function more like the demand chain of this scenario, trust dilemmas like this may force manufacturers to look to blockchain solutions.  There's a lot of work going into how to use blockchain-based input logs and unique identifiers to prove the veracity of data emanating from interconnected devices such as 3D printers. Applying a similar change-of-state log for alterations to software, blockchains could also assure users that the code in a particular file used to print the relevant part complies with the specifications as advertised, that it hasn’t been tampered with. Cryptographic proofs of the integrity of a 3D-printing process may well allow manufacturers to hire a supplier in minutes, whereas previously they could never do so without face-to-face meetings.  This kind of blockchain model could greatly speed up the onboarding process. But it would need to be based on permissionless, open access for new suppliers.  The changes we're talking about are step up from the 1990s round of disruption and decentralization that came with the advent of the Internet and globalization. Those trends created a wider pool of potential suppliers, disintegrating decades-old supply chains.  New IT technologies like 3D printing are an extension, or perhaps an acceleration, of the disruption unleashed then when the Internet decentralized the information-gathering process and removed barriers to communication. The next big step-function change will come from decentralizing the trust barrier.  That's the prism through which the boldest, most innovative manufacturers should be viewing blockchains and their critical role in the global economy of the future.

42400610,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK8CC,1509688852,Finance Bigwig Mohamed El-Erian Says Bitcoin Is a Commodity,"Bitcoin cannot be considered a currency, one of the world's most prominent financial commentators and institutional investors said.  Mohamed El-Erian told CNBC  that currencies normally serve as a store of value, but that they must be predictable and stable to work as a medium of exchange.  El-Erian, who is currently the chief economic advisor at the German financial institution Allianz, continued:  ""Bitcoins aren't there yet, they're still trying to find stability so it's more of a commodity than it's a currency.”  A former CEO and co-chief investment officer of fixed-income powerhouse PIMCO, El-Erian had previously said in September he believed bitcoin was overvalued, and that its price may reflect an assumption that the cryptocurrency will be adopted widely. At the time, he said that would not happen.  He doubled down on this assertion Thursday, telling CNBC that investors in bitcoin may be waiting for widespread adoption but that those thinking institutions and central banks would begin accepting it could be wrong.  El-Erian said his main long-term concern was whether “the assumption in the pricing about adoption [was] consistent with reality”  “That's the issue that investors should ask if they're holding bitcoins for a couple of months,” he told CNBC.  El-Erian is not the first major figure in mainstream finance to view bitcoin as more of a commodity than a currency. The governors of the Bank of Mexico and the Bank of Korea both gave similar assessments this year, as did the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2015.

42400617,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK8J5,1509681623,Shifting and Changing: Ethereum's Casper Code Takes Shape,"Ethereum's leading effort to reimagine how nodes in a blockchain system come to agreement is slowly but surely advancing.  At least that was the message front and center at Devcon3, the open-source project's annual technology conference, on Wednesday. The topic of casper – ethereum's much-anticipated version of proof-of-stake consensus – was present during a number of panels at the event.  One of a number of moving parts that need to come together for the project to realize its long-term vision, casper may be among the more important, as it's key to democratizing access to the platform. The perceived necessity of the upgrade was perhaps best put forward by Cornell University researcher Emin Gün Sirer, who argued how proof-of-work – bitcoin's system for keeping its network in sync – has lead to an environment wherein users can no longer participate as envisioned.  Sirer said during the event:  ""We're at the mercy of hardware. The technology is out of our hands.""  Along these lines, casper is aimed at a more egalitarian approach, differentiating ethereum through the introduction of a new spin on a system called proof-of-stake.  Rather than users buying specialized computers to run the software, the idea is that users would simply set aside funds (which would be locked for a period of time) and perform calculations for approving transactions. Through this action, users could compete for protocol rewards.  In this way, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has gone so far as to argue it should be prioritized above all other items on the roadmap. But because proof-of-stake would do away with elements of ethereum's infrastructure, the argument goes, security risks are emerging as a central concern.    On a panel alongside Sirer were ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir; fellow Cornell professor Elaine Shi; and Parity Technologies developer Peter Czaban. The overall feeling among those on the panel: casper needs to happen quickly – at least, as fast as it can within security constraints.  Crowded kitchen  Still, the delicate balance the project needs to strike contrasted with reports about the environment in which the code is being developed.  For example, it was confirmed that the authors of the original proposal – Zamfir and Buterin – are still working on competing versions of the tech, as they were at Devcon2 last year. While Buterin's version claims to be extremely simple, Zamfir's own version promises to constitute a very minimal shift.  Zamfir's presentation demonstrated that he has been quietly working to improve on the earliest version of casper, which included a more complex blockchain structure.  Based on the GHOST protocol, Zamfir's casper boasts faster transaction times through reshaping the rules by which blocks are verified. In this way, the underlying structure looks more like a zig-zag than a linear blockchain – and mirrors other proposals in trying to create a faster protocol.  Buterin's own version of casper, co-authored with fellow developer Virgil Griffith, has pivoted away from these ideas and moved toward a design which he aims to be ""as simple as possible, and as simple as to graph onto the existing proof-of-work systems as possible.""  Yet at this stage of development, there's still disagreement as to which take on casper achieves true simplicity, with Zamfir pointing to several other data structures that could be deployed to reach this goal.
