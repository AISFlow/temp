42377219,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyDx,1400191271,"BitPay, Toshiba Partnership Brings Bitcoin to 6,000 New Merchants","Bitcoin merchant payment processor BitPay has announced a new partnership with electronics manufacturer Toshiba that will integrate bitcoin payments into Toshiba’s touch-screen point-of-sale platform, VisualTouch.  BitPay  will provide technical assistance for the purpose of integrating bitcoin payments into the existing VisualTouch system. VisualTouch is used by more than 6,000 client-companies in the hospitality, restaurant, grocery and retail sectors worldwide.  The partnership is being formally announced at the 2014 National Restaurant Association Show, an annual conference held by the US-based food services trade group, which begins on 17th May.  Tony Gallippi, BitPay’s executive chairman, said that the partnership is a way to let more merchants experience the benefits of digital currency:  ""This partnership greatly expands the number of businesses that will now be able to accept bitcoin. BitPay is extremely excited about the relationship and the opportunity to expand the Toshiba VisualTouch solution to include bitcoin.""  Company efforts  The partnership highlights BitPay’s effort to expose more consumers and merchants to digital currency payments.  Earlier this week, the company announced a new testing platform for payments software developers, affording programmers a sandbox environment in which to to quickly and safely test new ideas.  The news also follows BitPay’s Series A funding round in which it raised $30m from an investor pool led by Index Ventures, but that also included Yahoo founder Jerry Yang’s AME Cloud Ventures and PayPal founder Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.  Positive about bitcoin  While it remains to be seen how VisualTouch integration will affect merchant acceptance of digital currencies, there are signs that small businesses that do accept the payment method are seeing positive results.  Our CoinDesk merchant survey showed that a larger number of merchants who began taking bitcoin as form of payment have seen a 10% boost in sales.  Additionally, a number of survey participants indicated that they chose to add bitcoin payments as a means to reduce costs, tap into consumer interest or simply support the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.

42377217,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyCh,1400189477,BitXatm Launches Optional One- or Two-Way Bitcoin ATM,"Germany-based digital currency ATM provider BitXatm has announced a novel upgrade to its existing Sumo Pro ATM product.  Called 'Smart Remote Control', the new feature allows owners to switch between one-way and two-way transaction capabilities. This means operators will be able to provide cash-to-digital currency transactions only, or both digital currency-to-fiat and fiat-to-digital currency transactions.  With the update, BitXatm's Sumo Pro will function more like traditional bitcoin ATMs, allowing two-way transactions. The company had previously offered one-way machines, while emphasizing its point-of-sale bill payment service.  Upgraded Sumo Pro units will be delivered with the capacity to store 300 to 600 incoming banknotes, and a cash recycler that will hold 30 notes for withdrawals.  Gabriel Prodanescu, CEO of BitXatm, believes the upgrade will allow owners better manage their risk level.  For example, he said that the upgraded Sumo Pro units allow merchants who want to process larger transactions the ability to do so, while those who worry about holding large cash reserves can store less physical currency.  Ready for shipment  BitXatm told CoinDesk that it is ready to ship all existing orders of its units by the end of May, and that these customers can elect to upgrade their units with Smart Remote Control at no additional cost. However, those who choose to upgrade will not receive their units until the end of June due to high order volumes.  New orders will be delivered between four and six weeks after payment and will come standard with Smart Remote Control.  Prodanescu told CoinDesk that the upgraded Sumo Pros will retail for around €3,900.  ATM and POS play  Billed as an ATM and POS system, BitXatm offers a number of additional functionalities with its Sumo Pro product, including a web-based back-end that allows owners to watch cash flow, profits and change settings on the unit in real time.  The company's Sumo Pro unit can accept payments in any digital currency and any fiat currency, and comes free of any additional upkeep payments.

42377225,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyMl,1400181381,Coinkite Taps Bitcoin Developer Peter Todd For Advisory Role,"Bitcoin debit card provider Coinkite has announced that bitcoin core developer Peter Todd and forex trading veteran Nooshin Mohtashami will join the company in key advisory roles.  Todd will serve as Coinkite’s 'Chief Naysayer', helping the company review its infrastructure and business practices, while Mohtashami will join the company’s advisory board.  Noted for his work as a bitcoin developer, Todd is perhaps best known for his involvement with so-called 'Bitcoin 2.0' projects like Counterparty, Mastercoin and Colored Coins.  He told CoinDesk that he was drawn to the project, in part, because its focus on product development gives him a 'balance' to his other work, saying:  ""They're very production focused and are implementing relatively simple technology and doing the job perfectly. My other clients are pushing fundamental theory forward – they're much more experimental.""  Empowering users  As Chief Naysayer, Todd will act as a key advisor as the company grows and evolves.  He remarked that, for him, empowering bitcoin users through decentralisation is central to providing more secure and efficient tools to the ecosystem.  Todd said:    ""My goals at Coinkite are ultimately about decentralisation. We have to give users the tools they need to use bitcoin securely so the underlying system can remain free of onerous regulation.      Coinkite's model of professional security as a service is a good option for some users.""    Todd added that he won’t actually code or contribute directly to Coinkite’s projects; rather, he will serve as a guiding voice for the company.  Pivotal role  Mohtashami’s role at the company will no doubt draw from her background in currency services, having previously served as chief operating officer for OANDA, a forex trading and currency data service.  According to Coinkite CEO Rodolfo Novak, Mohtashami will play a pivotal role in the company’s transformation into an ""international crypto bank"":  ""Nooshin has been exploring the bitcoin space over the last year and we're very excited to welcome her to our growing team. Her background as a computer engineer and her in-the-trenches business leadership experience will serve her well.""  Steady growth  The advisor appointments are an indication that Coinkite is seriously pushing for a bigger spot in the bitcoin business ecosystem.  The company began testing its point-of-sale (POS) technology last year, including a chip-and-pin card reader designed to accept Coinkite’s bitcoin debit card. At the time, Novak told CoinDesk that this approach relies on the notion that ""people will start to adopt the tools that they are already used to"".  Coinkite has since expanded on its initial business model, offering secure storage for bitcoin companies as well as more advanced POS technology.  The hiring of Todd and Mohtashami suggests that Coinkite plans to further develop in this direction.

42377216,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zy7f,1400176877,CoinJar Launches Bitcoin Donation Drive for Teen Entrepreneur,"Australia-based bitcoin wallet and exchange service CoinJar has pledged nearly A$4,000 in bitcoin to a crowdfunding campaign started by young entrepreneur Madelaine Scott.  The 19-year-old owner of Madelaine’s Organic Eggshttp://www.hollyburton.com.au/?q=madelaine, based in Melbourne, Australia, is seeking to raise at least A$60,000 on Pozible to purchase an egg-grading and cleaning machine for her 900-plus flock of hens.  In addition to the initial bitcoin donation, CoinJar has said that it will match any contributions made in the digital currency by its user base, up to an additional A$10,000.  In a statement on its website, the company cited the success of the dogecoin NASCAR crowdfunding project, which fielded $50,000 to sponsor driver Josh Wise, as a driving factor behind the initiative, saying:  ""If r/dogecoin can sponsor a NASCAR, surely we can help Madelaine get her business to the next level.""  How it works  The exchange says customers can make donations to Scott directly through Pozible, while finalizing the transaction with CoinJar.  After going through an approval process on Pozible, users can opt to pay with BTC. CoinJar notes that customers need to input a valid return address in case the crowdfunding project does not meet its goal.  Pozible then gives the user the option to sync with their CoinJar wallet. Once redirected to the wallet service, the user finalizes the payment and their pledge is authorized.  The fundraiser ends on 26th May, and to date, Scott has raised more than $45,000. Like other crowdfunding platforms, donations through Pozible earn users scaled rewards that, in this case, include egg shipments and weekend getaways at the organic farm.  Digital currency's crowdfunding potential  CoinJar growth strategist Samuel Tate told CoinDesk that the company was drawn to Madelaine's business because of her entrepreneurial spirit and her ability to quickly grow her home-spun business.  Additionally, it proved an opportunity to see the impact of bitcoin on targeted crowdfunding projects.  Tate said that:  ""Bitcoin allows the costs of money transfer to be reduced, which makes micro payments more feasible. Previously small transactions were not practical due to paypal and credit card costs. Bitcoin makes it possible for more platforms like Pozible to reduce their costs of money and pass these benefits onto people like Maddy.""  Scott agreed, telling CoinDesk that bitcoin's role in crowdfunding may very well grow in the future, saying the digital currency ""will become more versatile over time"".  Additionally, bitcoin donations could serve as a way for people to avoid some of the fees traditionally associated with sending money between parties.  She added that she has seen a noticeable impact since CoinJar began its donation drive. Further, she said that a potential egg client has expressed interest in purchasing orders using bitcoin exclusively.  Bitcoin growth  Australia has emerged as one of the more active areas for bitcoin businesses in recent months.  Last week, Australia-based VC firm Future Capital launched a US$30m global investment fund for bitcoin companies, while cashless ATM provider Diamond Circle introduced a bitcoin debit card.  Australia’s regulators have not been as enthusiastic toward digital currency, however. The country's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, suggested in a document published in late April that bitcoin poses a “limited” risk to the country’s existing payments infrastructure.  The report went on to add that bitcoin’s “appeal of low fees and fast transaction times” would likely not form the basis for broader adoption.

Established in 2004, Mollie is one of the leading payments services in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, catering to more than 10,000 merchants across the Benelux region, according to the company.  The company says that the addition of bitcoin will allow thousands of merchants to start accepting the digital currency immediately, without the need for further integration.  Furthermore, merchants do not need to have any experience with bitcoin or even a bitcoin wallet to use the new service.  “Mollie accepts the bitcoin equivalent of the transaction amount and credits the online merchant’s euro account within two working days,” the company said. “The bitcoin-euro exchange rate is fixed at the time of payment and this amount as well as the payment is guaranteed.  Leading bitcoin payments processors BitPay and Coinbase use a similar approach, thereby eliminating volatility concerns.  Seamless transactions  Mollie says it can offer bitcoin services seamlessly and risk free, just as with any other online payment method.  Gaston Aussems, Mollie's CEO, believes a two-sided market is necessary for bitcoin payments to become commonplace. Effectively, there need to be enough customers able to pay with bitcoin and sufficient points of sales accepting them.  “We are convinced that, by making it simple and risk-free for online merchants to accept bitcoins, we are providing a major contribution to the mass adoption and use of bitcoin,” he said, adding.  “We believe in the future of cryptocurrencies, as their DNA matches that of online commerce: real time, low transaction costs and cross-border.”  Mollie’s API is integrated in leading shopping software platforms, such as Shopify, Magento, PrestaShop, SEOshop and OpenCart.

42377224,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyKF,1400165391,CNET Founder Launches Low-Cost Bitcoin Payments Platform,"CNET founder and technology entrepreneur Halsey Minor has formally announced Bitreserve.org – a new low-cost bitcoin and fiat currency payments platform geared toward both consumers and merchants.  Most notably, the service will allow fiat-to-fiat transfers at zero cost between Bitreserve members. This means that a customer could issue a payment to a merchant without having to pay transaction costs. Bitreserve charges a nominal fee for bitcoin transactions in order to pay miners.  During a press conference, Minor remarked that one of the central problems with bitcoin is the issue of price differences that take place during transactions. Bitreserve moves to solve this by greatly speeding up the transaction process within the platform, he said, adding:  ""If you want to create something that is perceived as money, it's going to have to represent the same value that people are using already.""  How it works  The user experience of Bitreserve relies on a system of digital and fiat currency wallets called Currency Cards. In addition to a BTC wallet, users are provided with USD, CNY, GBP, EUR and JPY versions too.  After creating an account, customers can freely exchange value between the wallets.  Because transactions are settled internally, processing times are significantly reduced. During a demonstration, Minor showed that the average transaction was about 10 seconds.  The speed of bitcoin transactions is also increased because Bitreserve acts as a preliminary authorization source for that transaction. Transactions are later verified by the bitcoin mining network, with Bitreserve charging a small fee in order to pay the miners.  Minor cited the service's cloud-based infrastructure as the reason why the service can offer low-cost bitcoin transaction as well as free fiat currency transactions, saying:  ""Because we built a cloud-based service thats debiting and crediting money, instead having a bunch of banks and processing companies in the middle, we can do this very quickly between accounts.""  Notably, each wallet possesses a bitcoin address, and any BTC sent to one of those wallets is automatically converted into that particular fiat currency.  Zero costs  In addition to functioning as a consumer-to-consumer payments platform, Bitreserve can also act as a payments platform for merchants.  Minor demonstrated how a hypothetical transaction with Amazon might work, with the e-commerce site hosting its own account and accepting payments from customers. A customer would sync their account with an online merchant as they would a credit card or gift card.  Minor commented that merchants have an incentive to get involved with Bitreserve, even in light of the bitcoin payments processing ecosystem's already low-cost solutions, saying:  ""Merchants who are now accepting Bitreserve either directly or as part of another payments system, their costs would be zero.""  During the press conference, Minor noted that Bitreserve does not currently have any partnerships in place. However, he said the company is looking to form such partnerships in the near future.  Digital media pioneer  Minor founded CNET in 1995. The company, which initially produced radio and television programming, later moved to web journalism and blogging. It also acquired several companies in the digital media space during the early and mid-2000s, before being sold to the CBS Corporation in 2008 for $1.8bn.  In 2005, Minor established a venture capital firm, Minor Ventures, which funded several tech startups. One of these, GrandCentral Communications Inc., was acquired by Google in 2007 and served as the basis for its Google Voice service.  Minor was also one of the founders of 12 Entrepreneuring Inc., a tech incubator, in 2000. The company counted investor Marc Andreessen and Gateway co-founder Ted Waitt among its board of directors and raised more than $130m from investors at the time.  Legal woes  Allegations of misuse of company funds and personal infighting led the exit of some of 12’s chief backers and the eventual breakup of the group just over a year after its founding. A group of investors sought to recoup their funds, and the company closed its doors in 2001 after reaching an agreement with the investors.  A string of investments that went sour, including the purchase of the Carter’s Grove Plantation in Virginia, led to more court battles. Minor was also drawn into several lawsuits involving the auction houses Christie’s and Sotheby’s.  Minor filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in May 2013. At the time, he listed roughly $100 million in debt and $50 million in listed assets, Bloomberg reported that year.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/15/cnet-founder-launches-low-cost-bitcoin-payments-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b310af8c652eb06d851c3743d3ac6fae0da7ca79-958x701.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42377226,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyLV,1400156479,Students Offered Free Bitcoins in Coinbase Giveaway,"Bitcoin digital wallet and payment processor Coinbase has announced a unique bitcoin giveaway aimed at college students.  The company says it is handing out $10-worth of bitcoin to students who create a new Coinbase account using approved .edu email addresses.  The giveaway kicked off a few days ago and Coinbase says interest is ""impressive"".  The company published a leaderboard on its blog, featuring the most popular university domains so far: University of Illinois is in the lead, with 496 students signing up using illinois.edu email addresses. Bitcoin loving Texans rank second, with 290 signups originating from utexas.edu email addresses. California’s Berkeley University came in third with 232 signups.  Spreading the word  Coinbase is asking users to tweet or share the blog post, which includes simple step-by-step instructions and terms of service.  This is a limited time offer, but Coinbase is not saying how long it plans to keep going. The offer is good only for one customer and one access device. Recipients will not be eligible for referral bonuses provided in other Coinbase promotions.  Furthermore, interested participants should be aware that not every .edu domain is covered by the terms of offer.  “We have tried to include the top 500 universities worldwide (this is not US focused) but we can’t guarantee all universities are supported. We may also disable certain universities where we see abuse,” said Coinbase.  Of course, those new to Coinbase are encouraged to sign up – and tell their friends.  MIT inspiration  In offering this giveaway, CoinBase said it was inspired by a project launched by two MIT students, under which all 4,500 undergraduates at MIT will receive $100 worth of bitcoin.  The original idea came from the MIT Bitcoin Club, more specifically members Dan Elitzer and Jeremy Rubin.  However, Elitzer and Rubin do not intend to hand out bitcoins for nothing. This is a serious, $500,000 research project, aimed to use the giveaway as a huge cryptocurrency experiment and foster further research and entrepreneurial activity.  With $100 worth of free bitcoin at their disposal, students have a good incentive to take part once the programme launches this fall.  The Coinbase giveaway is not as ambitious, but it will encompass more students and hopefully encourage more people into the world of digital currencies.

42377229,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyQX,1400153699,How Monegraph Uses the Block Chain to Verify Digital Assets,"Monegraph, a collaborative project between a New York University professor and a technologist offers a radical new way for artists to secure digital property – by logging it in the namecoin block chain.  To use the service, users sign in to Monegraphhttp://monegraph.herokuapp.com/ via Twitter and choose a URL location of a digital asset, such as artwork. Paying a small network fee via the namecoin QT client results in the Twitter account and URL being placed on the block chain.  Kevin McCoy is the NYU professor that worked with Anil Dash to create Monegraph. An artist himself, McCoy said he had considered building Monegraph for some time:  ""I was thinking of this idea of authentication around digital media, digital artwork for a while. And there seemed like a real need – a real-world application.""  One-day project  The Monegraph concept was turned into something real by McCoy and Dash as part of an event called Seven on Seven. The purpose of the symposium, held at the New Museum in New York City, is to pair artists with technical professionals to build a project within one day.  ""I think the event organizers put us together because they knew that we had been thinking about these ideas. We were able to come up with a working model of it relatively quickly,"" said McCoy.  Dash is known for being involved early with blogging and social media. The pairing of Twitter for verification with Monegraph is likely a nod towards such experience.  Using existing social media as an identity that appears on the namecoin block chain is certainly a unique approach.  Proof of digital media  The ability to verify digital item via a public general ledger is a concept that could gain traction in the cryptocurrency community. Another project called Proof of Existence is used by developers, for example, to create unique hashes for each version of code that they create.  Monegraph builds on this idea, but is geared towards digital media already posted on the web. One application for users would be to create a hash that combines a Twitter account with a public image of themselves posted on the web as a method of verifying identity.    I'm using @monegraph to claim the image at http://t.co/XXoyr4FjNN #monegraph      — Daniel Cawrey (@danielcawrey) May 13, 2014    Block chain as public verification  The ability to use block chain technology to prove ownership of a digital asset could be useful to protect intellectual property. While, legal complexities exist for the time being, courts around the world will eventually need become familiar with the use of cryptographic hashes as a form of verification.  McCoy realizes that mediation of ownership disputes is still a concern with this technology, but he believes that the best way for block chain certification to gain traction is through making projects like Monegraph.  The more that the idea of block chain's power to prove ownership is exposed to the public, the better:  ""As an author, as a publisher, as an issuer – the validity of your claim is strengthened the more you are public about it.""  Not just bitcoin  The use of namecoin's block chain for Monegraph is a telling signal that it is not just bitcoin that has value. McCoy says that the use of namecoin was a ""practical matter"" – it's an altcoin that can be used to verify DNS registrations in a decentralized way.  Despite namecoin's different use case, the developer community has not been particularly busy working on its core client when compared to bitcoin or dogecoin.  Furthermore, it's not easy for people to obtain namecoin, compared with other cryptocurrencies. Then there is the thorny issue getting the general public to understand how this form of digital asset verification works.  McCoy is aware of these issues, noting Monegraph was built in a day.  It's not the coin that matters, he says – rather, it is public ledger technology that could turn this idea into a new method of proof. He knows, though, that it has to be super-simple for people to use decentralized ownership concepts, saying:  ""In the future, I would like to be somewhat block chain agnostic. [But] there’s got to be a platform. At the end of the day, this has to be developed into a platform that makes it easy for people to use.""

42377221,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyFD,1400150210,India's New Bitcoin Exchange BTCXIndia is First with Real Time Trading,"India now has a full and compliant bitcoin exchange called BTCXIndia – also featuring a live trading platform and wallet service – which launched officially on 5th May in the southern city of Hyderabad.  It's a significant step for the country's bitcoin economy as its previous exchanges, some of which operated as fixed-price buy-sell platforms, lived with a degree of regulatory uncertainty since a series of government warnings and raids on bitcoin businesses in December and January.  BTCXIndia  CEO Mupparaju Siva Kameswara Rao is Managing Director of S Capital Solutions Pvt Ltd – the company behind the new exchange. The main objective, said Rao, is first to educate Indian customers about digital currencies and then to provide them with a secure, transparent and compliant trading platform.  Rao is also happy with the response he's received so far and expects trade to pick up quickly if new sign-ups continue at the current rate, he added.  Security and compliance  BTCXIndia currently has 10 staff members, working in development, customer services and compliance. Investment comes via a UK company that has funded the exchange for at least one year, and is also working as a strategic advisor to the management team.  Rao said the management team itself consists of a Tech Lead from India's Institute of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers, and a Compliance Officer from the financial services industry.  BTCXIndia keeps the absolute majority of the coins it holds in cold offline storage, and is also working on a proof-of-reserves implementation and ""other interesting features"" to reassure customers their funds are always 100% safe.  Rao added that the security measures are necessary to counter the ""poor track record of the exchange industry in the past,"" referring not to India but bitcoin exchanges worldwide.  In India, too, there is a particular need for a cautious approach thanks to government uncertainty, he said, explaining:    ""It is clear that using bitcoins and trading bitcoins is not illegal in India, but it is still unclear who regulates it and what requirements the government will have on exchanges.      With that in mind, we have taken the approach of self-regulation, and are following know-your-customer procedures and anti-money laundering guidelines at par with similar requirements imposed on regulated financial institutions. In this way we make sure that we know whom we are dealing in all cases, in order to prevent illicit usage.""    Regulatory confusion  Bangalore-based exchange Unocoin launched in December 2013 during that city's first bitcoin conference, saying it intended to be fully compliant with customer verification procedures and other regulations.  On 24th December, however, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a warning that Unocoin and others like it were operating without approval, causing the exchanges to cease all services as a precaution. Ahmedabad's Buysellbitco.in was raided and information service CoinMonk received a visit from tax officials seeking more information.  Unocoin  , owned by the same group as CoinMonk, came back online in the first week of January, however, and is still in business.  Current environment  In January, bitcoin enthusiast Venugopal Badaravada made a representation for clarification on bitcoin policy to the RBI through a lawyer. His 'deadline' of 7th January passed without a response and, as of May, the central bank has still not issued any further policy statements.  However, Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said in February:  ""The RBI is presently examining the issues associated with the usage, holding and trading of virtual currencies, including bitcoins, under the extant legal and regulatory framework of the country, including foreign exchange and payment systems laws and regulations.""  BTCXIndia's Rao added that the Prime Minister's office had recently approved 100 million Indian rupees ($1.7m) in funding for a top Hyderabad based crypto-research institute for the study of cryptographic technology and currencies.  Next big thing  In December, the bitcoin community turned to India as its next great hope after Chinese government statements caused the price to drop from its record high of $1,200. India is an emerging economy with a population of over a billion people, nearly half of whom are unbanked or under-served by banks.  It also receives around $70bn in overseas remittances per year, making up 4% of its GDP. Together with its roughly 250m Internet users and a proclivity for high-tech industry, India would seem perfect for the introduction of a breakthrough financial technology like bitcoin.  With some regulatory clarity and reliable services, India may yet fulfil that promise.
