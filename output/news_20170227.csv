42427427,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKS5h,1488229273,Coinbase Just Stopped Serving Bitcoin Customers in Hawaii,"Digital currency exchange Coinbase said today that it will stop serving customers in Hawaii following regulatory changes in the US state.  The startup said that it received word last September from the Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions that it would be required to hold cash reserves equal to any digital currency-denominated funds held for its customers. Citing the cost burden this requirement creates, Coinbase said that it would require its customers in Hawaii to close their accounts in the next 30 days and remove any funds they may be using the service to store.  Further, Coinbase said that it would block new customer registrations from Hawaii, a policy decision it said would be ""indefinite"" in light of the regulatory concerns.  However, Coinbase indicated that it could reopen its doors to customers in Hawaii should conditions improve, citing a push to create a blockchain working group in the state’s legislature as a positive development.  The startup went on to say:  “Although it comes as little consolation to Hawaii customers, Coinbase hopes to work with policymakers to either change the law or to encourage the DFI commissioner to revisit her existing policy discretion under Hawaii law. We are heartened that members of the Hawaii State House of Representatives have recently introduced a bill that would create a digital currency and blockchain working group.”  It’s not the first time that Coinbase has closed up shop in a US state following regulatory concerns.  In June 2015, Coinbase cited a similar move by the Wyoming Division of Banking to require commensurate cash reserves when it stopped serving customers in the state.

42427429,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKS7h,1488225641,Blockchain Trade Group Partners with Securities Industry Organization,"The Chamber of Digital Commerce has announced a new research and educational partnership with a US-based finance and securities sector trade group.  The Structured Finance Industry Group (SFIG), headquartered in Washington, DC, includes a range of issuers, mortgage companies, creditors, investors and other financial firms. According to its website, more than 350 firms are part of the group, a number of whom have pursued applications of the tech.  The Chamber, a blockchain industry trade group also based in DC, will work with the SFIG on research and education outreach, including the development of a new white paper focused primarily on the asset securitization sector, penned in conjunction with professional services firm Deloitte.  As part of that outreach, the two groups are hosting educational sessions at the SFIG Vegas 2017 conference in Las Vegas, which began Monday.  Richard Johns, executive director of the SFIG, said in a statement:  ""Partnering with the Chamber is a key part of our focus on being a central resource of forward looking education to all market participants. With this partnership we can create new, forward-thinking and educational opportunities for our members enabling them to stay fully informed of how technology is impacting their business.""  Chamber president and co-founder Perianne Boring positioned the move as a way for the industry to advance its tech into specific quarters of the finance space, including structured finance.  ""Our partnership with SFIG is an opportunity to accelerate the understanding and adoption of blockchain technology in this sector,"" she said.

42427417,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKRnh,1488214898,Russia's PM: Blockchain Tech Could Bring Big Changes,"Blockchain tech could have a major impact, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev reportedly said today, before going on to note that ""so far we do not see results"".  Medvedev, a former Russian president who became prime minister after current head of state Vladimir Putin took office in 2012, spoke today during an investors summit in the city of Sochi, according to state-owned news service TASS. He has spoken about the technology in the past, discussing the legal implications of blockchain and smart contracts in particular.  According to translated remarks, Medvedev stated today that he was ""not against"" the use of the tech but stopped well short of endorsement, suggesting that it might have an impact in the future.  He reportedly told event attendees:  ""I'm not against the use of [blockchain] technologies that have become widely circulated and which may thus decisively change our lives. It's quite an interesting story, but so far we do not see results.""  Medvedev’s comments stand in contrast with those from the Russian central bank, which has made no secret about its interest in blockchain.  The Bank of Russia moved to formally study the tech in early 2016, later establishing a fintech working group focused in part on blockchain in January.  The central bank, which has studied the tech from a range of perspectives including digital currency, developed a prototype distributed ledger last year, dubbed ""Masterchain"", as part of its testing.

42427399,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMZh,1488211243,Canada’s Securities Watchdog Seeks Blockchain Firms for Startup 'Sandbox',"The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the country’s top securities regulatory, is launching a new fintech “sandbox” program aimed at blockchain startups and other firms working with financial technology.  Launched today, the initiative joins a growing body of similar efforts undertaken by regulators worldwide, including those in Singapore, Taiwan and the UK, among other places. The idea, backers say, is to curate an environment in which companies can test new kinds of financial products – like a distributed ledger or digital currency – without materially impacting the broader marketplace.  Among the types of firms being solicited for the initiative are ""cryptocurrency or distributed ledger technology based ventures"", according to statements from the CSA.  Louis Morisset, chair of the CSA, said of the launch:  ""The objective of this initiative is to facilitate the ability of those businesses to use innovative products, services and applications all across Canada, while ensuring appropriate investor protection.""  While it remains to be seen which kind of companies ultimately enter the sandbox, the timing of its launch comes amid a broader push toward blockchain within Canada, including among its banking sector. Perhaps most notably to date, the Canadian central bank has been testing a distributed ledger-based digital currency.  Dubbed ""Project Jasper"", the initiative has seen the Bank of Canada trial the tech alongside a group of domestic banks and startup R3. The Bank of Canada has also indicated that it would consider further blockchain tests in the future.

42427397,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMXh,1488209415,BIS Report: DLT 'Promising' But 'A Long Way Off',"The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has released a new report on blockchains and distributed ledger technology.  Described as an an analytical guide to the tech for central banks and financial market authorities, the report was penned by the BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures. (The BIS has been described as the ""central banker's central bank"", as it provides banking resources to the world's central bank ecosystem.)  The report  , released today, offers a broad overview of blockchain's possible use in market infrastructures, focusing on its technical design, impact on market safety and efficiency and the broader potential influence the tech could have should it see wider adoption.  Overall, the scope is wide, and the working group behind the paper stops short of issuing any formal design recommendations. Rather, it echoes publications from market watchdogs like the European Markets and Securities Authority (ESMA), which has said that the tech's long-term impact is uncertain at this stage.  The report's authors state:  ""Developments to date suggest that DLT bears promise but that there is still a long way to go before that promise may be fully realized. Much work is needed to ensure that the legal underpinnings of DLT arrangements are sound, governance structures are robust, technology solutions meet industry needs and that appropriate data controls are in place and satisfy regulatory requirements.""  Perhaps the most notable section of the report challenges the concept that blockchains are naturally more efficient than other alternatives.  ""It is important to consider that potential improvements in the speed of end-to-end processing are being referred to at the ecosystem level (i.e. across the value chain), and that the speed of transaction settlement within the infrastructure itself may be slower,"" it reads.  The report is the latest from the BIS, which has previously explored blockchain-related concepts in its published work. The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures previously addressed bitcoin and digital currencies in a report released in 2015.  At the time, the BIS suggested that the widespread use of digital currencies could have an impact on the working abilities of central banks, while speculating that more traditional financial firms might benefit from exploring its applications.  Unanswered questions  Though the report seeks to cast a wide net in its exploration of the tech, its most notable aspects relate to the as-yet unanswered questions around blockchain's use for market infrastructure.  Those behind the report appear to be in two minds on if current distributed ledger designs may ultimately help any transparency boosts the tech could bring.  The BIS talks about the trade-offs inherent in limiting the number of participants in a ledger, while also suggesting that a more open and resilient financial system may provide benefits.  ""One possible benefit of DLT in an interconnected system is that data shared across key entities may lead to greater market transparency and more effective risk management across systems,"" the report reads.  Also singled out are so-called smart contracts (or self-executing code that can interact and create changes within a blockchain system), with the BIs warning that these applications may create ""challenges and risks"" for the market.  ""Automated contract tools, for example, are not immune to malicious or faulty code,"" it reads. ""Moreover, simultaneous automated execution between contracts (and codes) could cause adverse and unpredictable behavioural patterns in the financial ecosystem. Likewise, interdependencies between contracts (and codes) could result in a transmission channel for unforeseen risk.""  Ultimately, the BIS report stresses that what is needed most is a ""well-founded, clear, transparent and enforceable legal basis"" for the technology.  It concludes:  ""DLT can increase legal risks if there is ambiguity or lack of certainty about an arrangement’s legal basis.""

42427395,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMHh,1488204063,Bloq Buys Blockchain Analytics Firm Skry in First Acquisition,"Blockchain analytics startup Skry has been acqui-hired by Bloq.  Though few details have been initially disclosed, the deal was closed late last week, bringing both the assets and team behind Skry under the Bloq umbrella.  The acqui-hire is Bloq’s first since its launch in early 2016, backed by $250,000 in funding by Tally Capital – the VC fund of which Bloq co-founder Matthew Roszak is founding partner.  The news comes months after Skry, originally known as Coinalytics, rebranded and moved to service the broader blockchain market. In statements, Bloq said that it plans to utilize the tools and skills developed at Skry as it looks to expand in the enterprise blockchain market.  According to Bloq co-founder and CEO Jeff Garzik, the move complements existing work already underway at the startup.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The whole thing behind Bloq is we have a wide stack that are sold together as one unit. And this gives us a real acceleration of the analytics offering... The Skry team and Skry intellectual property and software are really going to give that a jumpstart. We were building out an analytics platform and this is an additive to that package.""  Skry – which was founded in 2014 and raised $1.1m in 2015 – was one of the early entrants in the bitcoin analytics marketplace, providing risk assessment services to exchanges and wallet services. The idea, according to Bloq, is to use that approach as part of a broader pitch to the enterprise space.  Last year, the firm joined professional services firm PwC, along with blockchain startups Libra and Netki, in launching a platform called Vulcan Digital Asset Services, aiming to create a hub for the development of new kinds of digital assets.  ""We’re looking at private blockchains, permission blockchains analytics... We’re going to implement it across multiple blockchains,"" said Garzik.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Roszak indicated that the analytics component was a ""key piece"" of that approach, adding:  ""Without analytics you’re missing a key piece to the puzzle to know how the blockchains are behaving.""

42427392,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMNh,1488203968,DTCC Moves to Next Stage of Digital Asset Blockchain Trial,"The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has completed the first leg of a post-trade distributed ledger trial conducted in partnership with startup Digital Asset Holdings.  The DTCC, which oversees the clearing and settlement of more than $1qn in US securities each year, said that it would look to expand the trial – which focused on the netting process for US Treasury and agency repurchase agreement transactions – by including more parties in the next planned phase.  As part of that step, DTCC and Digital Asset will convene a Stakeholder Working Group dedicated to this purpose. There, the two firms will solicit feedback on the technology, with an eye to use that input to inform the development process.  In statements, DTCC struck a bullish tone about the future prospects of its blockchain work.  Michael Bodson, president and CEO of the company, said of the trial:  ""We are very pleased with the results from our repo proof-of-concept effort with Digital Asset, and we see this project as another validation of the potential of this exciting, emerging technology.""  The firm is projecting a completion date for its second test phase by June, and from there, it will assess whether to push ahead and develop the repo transaction solution further.  DTCC and Digital Asset have been working collaboratively since early last year on post-trade applications, and the securities settlement giant has partnered with a number of blockchain startups with the aim of potentially transforming how it handles transactions.  As reported by CoinDesk last March, the first phase of the trial saw the two firms working to ensure that its processes could operate on a multi-mode blockchain while integrating with existing internal processing systems.  The DTCC will now migrate its ""start"" leg of same day trades to a blockchain system.  ""While DTCC’s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) currently provides the matching and verification of repo transactions, only the 'close' leg of same-day settling trades is netted and settled by FICC with the 'start' leg settling outside of the system. With this project, DTCC seeks to also net the 'start' leg, further reducing settlement risk and costs to members by allowing additional netting and offsets,"" a release said.  The DTCC is also working with firms like R3 and Axoni on distributed ledger use cases.

42427390,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMJh,1488202208,Monax to Bring Ethereum Tech to Hyperledger Blockchain Group,"Blockchain startup Monax has joined Hyperledger, the Linux Foundation-led open-source consortium building a wide-range of enterprise-grade solutions based on the technology.  While Hyperledger now counts among its members more than 100 companies, Monax’s admission to the consortium makes it the first to also submit a codebase with an ethereum virtual machine, the component that handles state computation on the public ethereum blockchain.  Following news that Monax had also joined the stealthy Enterprise Ethereum consortium, the announcement today is part of a larger push in the blockchain industry to prepare ethereum for primetime. (JP Morgan, Santander and BNY Mellon are reportedly among the banks and financial firms so far involved in that effort.)  In conversation with CoinDesk, Monax CEO and co-founder Casey Kuhlman said that, if his company’s codebase is accepted to Hyperledger, it would not only accelerate ethereum development for business applications, but also give Hyperledger’s members a chance to steer the product's future direction.  Kuhlman said:  ""If we are successful in passing through the incubation process, we would be the first ethereum virtual machine compatible blockchain ... within the Hyperledger umbrella project.""  Preparing for change  Founded in 2014 as Eris Industries, the company (whose group of followers is known as the ' Marmot Denhttps://monax.io/2016/08/08/the-marmot-den-open-for-business/') formally changed its name to Monax last year. It offers both a command-line interface toolkit for blockchain lifecycle management, as well as the Eris DB blockchain client, which will soon rebrand.  One of the organizations that has experimented with Monax's open-source blockchain tools is Swift, the interbank messaging platform currently considering building blockchain into its payments platform.  At the moment, seven other projects have been accepted by Hyperledger for incubation, including Sawtooth Lake contributed by Intel; Cello, contributed by JP Morgan; and Fabric, contributed by IBM. R3's Corda and Axoni's Axcore are also expected to be contributed.  Prior to Monax’s preparations to join Hyperledger, the startup's Eris DB platform had been licensed under GNU’s General Public License. But as part of the preparations to be formally admitted to Hyperledger, Monax reconfigured its offering, placing it under the Apache 2 license.  Based on the change, previous open-source contributors to the Monax codebase have submitted agreements to license future derivatives works under the Apache 2 license, Kuhlman said.  Also as part of the possible integration, Monax expects to finalize the rebrand of its software – possibly including a community-driven vote on the new name.  ""We want to give a clean IP slate to the Linux foundation,"" said Kuhlman.  Relinquishing ownership  But like many other companies working with blockchain, Monax isn’t in only the one single consortium.  Just yesterday, the Connecticut-based startup announced it was also among the founding members of Enterprise Ethereum, a secretive consortium rumored to be launching soon.  According to Kuhlman, being in multiple consortia is core to what it means to work with open-source software on which anyone with the skill-set can build.  In fact, he positioned his firm's joining of Hyperledger as just the latest step in an evolution Monax and many other companies are experiencing where they cease owning an application in the traditional sense, and instead ""participate in an application"".  If Monax is successful in its incubations with Hyperledger and in Ethereum Enterprise, said Kuhlman, ""then our codebase essentially acts as a bridge between these two large communities"".  One small step for ethereum  The announcement today is part of a larger announcement scheduled for later this month, in which Hyperledger is expected to unveil a number of new members.  The news, planned to be formally confirmed on 28th February, follows months of searching by executive director Brian Behlendorf for an ethereum virtual machine to join the consortium, he told CoinDesk.  Since at least September, Behlendorf said, he’s been sorting through multiple applications ""looking for the right project"", along with other members of the Hyperledger technical steering committee (TSC).  Over and above just the “quality” of the code, Behlendorf indicated that he and the TSC were looking for whether a prospective codebase might ""complement"" the other technologies, and how committed is the team behind it to working with other companies during a possible integration process.  ""This seems to have that potential,” said Behlendorf. ""And it’s very much focused on implementation, on running code that now will potentially benefit from having an even larger audience of developers and users around it.”  Rite of passage  Now that the code has been prepared, the next step is for a formal written proposal to be submitted to the TSC during one of its weekly open meetings.  From there, Behlendorf anticipates it might take as little as a week or two from the time of submission to final approval.  Once the Monax codebase is accepted by the governing board and subjected to final ratification, it will be available side-by-side with the other projects currently in incubation.  Speaking about the possible applications of Monax in Hyperledger, Behlendorf concluded:  ""You can use it in ethereum. But maybe you can use it on Fabric, you maybe could use it on top of Sawtooth Lake. We’ll find out.""

42427412,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMph,1488198674,Banks Turn to Bitcoin Tracking in Fight Against Human Trafficking,"A shift occurred in the summer of 2015 that sent modern-day slavers flocking to bitcoin.  Following pressure from Illinois law enforcement, Visa and MasterCard ceased doing business with BackPage, an online classified ads service that has been accused of being a thinly veiled front for prostitution and human trafficking.  As some positioned the move as the kind of ""moral policing"" for which bitcoin was a perfect workaround, the decision had an unintended side effect that may have actually helped make the job of modern day slave traders even easier.  The tried-and-true investigative techniques that had been until that moment employed by law enforcement and banks to help prevent human trafficking were largely rendered null and void as the pedlars of human cargo embraced bitcoin.  Then, in December 2015, a victim of human trafficking and sexual slavery, Timea Nagy, addressed a room filled with financial executives from some of the largest banks in Canada and made a plea for help.  At the meeting, organised by the founder of social enterprise startup Timea's Causehttps://www.timeascause.ca/ as part of its process of training law enforcement and others to identify human trafficking victims, Nagy made a call to the room filled with financial executives, asking them to modernize the way they track the financial transactions that power human trafficking.  Nagy told CoinDesk:  ""In the olden days, we could track the traffickers purchasing sexual ads for victims. But because of bitcoin, you can't see where the money comes from and where it goes. So it's really, really hard for investigators to actually follow the money, specifically in human trafficking.""  The result of her plea was instant, and continues to bear fruit at some of the largest financial intuitions in Canada.  The director of risk intelligence for the Bank of Montreal (BMO), Peter Warrack, stood to accept the challenge, and by the time he left the building, he'd been contacted by Canada regulator FINTRAC and many of his banking peers.  ""She basically appealed to the audience, the banks, for help,"" Warrack told CoinDesk. ""Her message was: you're the banks, you see the money, you can help us identify the traffickers.""  Springing into action  The response was swift.  On 19th January, 2016, Warrack and his colleague at the Association of Certified Anti-money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS), Joseph Mari, formally launched Project Protect to reimagine the way human trafficking is tracked.  Representatives from all five largest banks in Canada are participating in Project Protect, he said, including the Bank of Montreal, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank and the Toronto-Dominion Bank.  Another member of Project Protect, professional advisory firm Grant Thornton has published a detailed account of what to look for to identify human trafficking across industries, including suspicious trends in industries such as hospitality, automotive, property management, travel and the financial services.  Initially, the group of banks, advisory firms and tech companies focused on drawing up a list of the high-tech ways slave traders cover their tracks, including 17 types of financial transaction patterns, six types of contextual 'indicators' and 11 types of financial transactions, formally published by FINTRAC in last December.  The document has ""been sent out to every reporting institution in Canada"" resulting in a ""many hundreds of percent increase"" in the incidences of financial institutions reporting suspicious activity, according to Mari, who is also a senior manager of major investigations at BMO.  Mari told CoinDesk:  ""It’s really brought things to the forefront, to increase reporting for human trafficking, which translates into increased arrests, getting people off the street, giving people a chance again.""  The bitcoin sub-stream  The official wording of the indicator on the official FINTRAC document describes what this particular type of human trafficking transaction might look like: ""Bitcoins or other virtual currencies: frequent purchases in multiples of small amounts (eg $3, $12, $24), directly by the client or through exchanges.""  As part of the process of identifying human trafficking trends Project Protect has partnered with ""major technology companies"" which Mari didn't want to name for this report to ""scrape BackPage and other adult sites on a daily basis.""  His team is looking for telephone numbers and emails to ""filter it down to what looks like human trafficking as opposed to normal sex trade workers.""  But with a proliferation of guides posted by sex trade workers on how to use bitcoin on BackPage and elsewhere, the amount of data was increasing and proved particularly difficult to parse.  ""As we started to flesh it out,"" Mari said. ""What we noticed was that cryptocurrency played a role in this, and it became a sub-stream within Project Protect.""  On 7th February, Project Protect hosted an event dedicated exclusively to blockchain and cryptocurrencies at the Toronto chapter of ACAMS. Present was the senior research director of Canada’s central bank, James Chapman, Alan Cohn of the Blockchain Alliance, Joseph Weinberg of Paycase and Jonathan Levin of Chainalysis.  Patterns in the bitcoin  Founded in 2015, Chainalysis's mission is to look for patterns on the bitcoin blockchain, in part to help fight cybercrime.  Since signing a contract with Barclays following the startup's completion of the British bank’s Rise accelerator, Chainalysis has gone on to raise $1.6m and is now working in a formal capacity with Europol to help fight online criminals.  At the Toronto event, Mari said he showed Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin the indicator criteria his team had determined based on crawling sites known to host human trafficking.  ""He was able to pull up transactions that mirrored that,"" said Mari. Even if the identities were obscured, it was a potentially important step, he said.  Levin confirmed with CoinDesk that he ""compared notes"" with event participants, going on to describe that since bitcoin is frequently exchanged for local currencies, identifying the ""typology"" of human trafficking using cryptocurrency required cooperation between companies like his, banks and the government.  ""We can identify the difference between single sex workers and what looks more like human trafficking,"" Levin said, adding:  ""Like Project Protect, this requires collaboration between private industry and law enforcement to share intelligence and information.""  Firsthand experience  Since inspiring the creation of Project Protect, Timea Nagy has continued her work alongside law enforcement to shine a light on human trafficking.  After an earlier non-profit she founded was unable to generate the funds it needed to be sustainable, Nagy launched Timea’s Cause as a for-profit social enterprise in 2014. She now works ""shoulder to shoulder"" with members of law enforcement to teach them how to identify human trafficking victims based on her own personal experience.  Nagy told CoinDesk she first moved from her home in Hungary to Canada at the age of 19 in pursuit of a job as a nanny.  After being told the nanny job was no longer available, she says she was ""broken in"" to the sex industry lifestyle and forced to perform various sexual acts earning her ""owners"" as much as $50k over the time she was kept.  She said:  ""After three months of that, I decided I would die in it or I’d die trying to escape.""  Since that time, the industry has changed. Though she declined to share details of how frequently she’s seen bitcoin used by sex traffickers, she says she has witnessed the impact firsthand as a result of traveling across North America working with various law enforcement officials.  Similar to Nagy’s own work, which has been conducted in tandem with both Canadian and US government officials, current anti-money laundering (AML) work to fight human trafficking using bitcoin is also international.  A global problem  Still, it is difficult to track the problem of human trafficking in Canada due to low incidences of reporting credited to the fear experienced by victims.  But, between 2005 and 2012, there were 25 human trafficking convictions in the country, with the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimating a total of 20.9 million victims of human trafficking around the world. Globally, total profits generated from the industry are estimated by ILO to be $150bn.  Helping track those profits is Joe Ciccolo, the second half of the so-called 'Bitcoin Joes' as they're known in the AML industry, along with Joseph Mari.  On 9th March, Ciccolo’s BitAML is speaking at a sister-event to the Toronto gathering hosted by the Chicago chapter of ACAMS. Also scheduled to attend is the state’s Illinois Blockchain Initiative, first reported by CoinDesk, the president of Chicago-based Burling Bank, the CEO of bitcoin ATM company Digital Mint and more.  Beyond that, a British think tank called the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) has commissioned Mari to review a paper analyzing the challenges of AML regulation around cryptocurrecies.  The paper is expected to be be released in March as part of the European Union Parliament's plans to implement new regulations.  Another call for help  It turns out Timea Nagy's plea for help has helped reveal just how much assistance is truly needed, even by the banks she herself reached out to.  In spite of the international support, Mari emphasizes the efforts to use cryptocurrency to track human trafficking are still in their earliest phases. He describes Project Protect’s goal as two-fold. The first target is to increase the reporting of suspicious transactions that fit the criteria his team of banks and more has created.  The second is more educational. But it’s not so much that they’re out to teach – which they are – but, rather, to learn, so they can better teach others how cryptocurrency is being used to continue modern-day slave trading.  Mari concluded:  ""Any help that we can get from the international community about what human trafficking looks like in the blockchain space would be very much appreciated.""

42427400,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMdh,1488193215,Overtaking Banking in the Race to Blockchain,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered exclusively to our subscribers.  This past week, European banks ING and Société Générale unveiled a blockchain platform designed to facilitate oil trading.  Far from making a splash on the front page of CoinDesk (or other publications for that matter), the news debuted via a quiet press release, eked out into cyberspace without much fanfare.  It's unfortunate, because this news was worth a second look.  To see why, let’s break the development down into three factors that make it stand out:  1. This project is not just a proof-of-concept.  The announcement revealed a live transaction with the commodities trading house Mercuria. A cargo shipment containing African crude oil was sold three times on its way to China.  Traders, banks, an agent and an inspector were all involved.  According to the participants, the result proved that a blockchain-powered system can significantly reduce the time needed to complete a transaction, as well as enhance document reliability, auditability and user experience.  2. The commodities industry needs a logistical overhaul.  Insiders point out that it has changed little over the past few decades and still relies on paper-intensive processes: rife with redundancies, errors and delays.  Letters of credit, bills of lading, shipping contracts, insurance, transport and payment are just some of the components of a commodity trade that could be automated by a digital platform.  And the transparency and immutability afforded by blockchain technology could remove the risks associated with trust and ensure that each phase seamlessly connects with the next.  While the experiment was for an oil transaction, the steps involved in trades of other commodities are not very different, which will allow the platform to easily scale.  3. The nature of the oil trading sector puts it in a unique position to overtake the financial sector in blockchain implementation.  First and foremost, it is dominated by a handful of big players. Some are large conglomerates, but others are independent firms with a lower aversion to risk than most financial institutions.  The implication is that with one or two demonstrating positive results from moving operations to a blockchain platform, the others will quickly follow suit in order to maintain competitive margins.  Furthermore, the need to stay competitive is likely to become more acute as the market heads into an environment of lower profits due to a flattening forward curve.  Finally, the potential impact on the global economy of more efficient oil trade could end up being even greater than that of a more efficient financial system.  While it is pointless to debate the relative importance of money vs oil – both are essential in today’s economy – it is hard to deny that financial products are already easier to send across borders. The benefits resulting from gains in speed and cost in the movement of oil are therefore likely to have an even greater short-term effect.  A more efficient oil trading system would not only have a greater influence in smoothing the uneven distribution of such a necessary resource; it could also encourage blockchain experimentation and adoption all the way up and down the value chain.
