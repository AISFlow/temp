14556526,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541333,1688598016,Rapid Rise In Cardano’s TVL Points Toward Bullish Sentiment Around ADA,"Cardano is one of the most prominent proof of stake (POS) blockchains that requires users to stake their native tokens, ADA, to confirm and secure transactions on the network. Over time, the network has held the record for the largest percentage of its token supply staked. And once again, the blockchain has solidified its position in this regard as it reaches a new high for the total amount of ADA staked in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Cardano Token TVL Reaches New All-Time High Back in September 2021, Cardano saw the completion of the Alonzo hard fork upgrade, an update that brought smart contracts capability to the network. What this meant was that developers could now build decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain, finally bringing the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector to Cardano. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2,000 As Crypto Market Shakes Off SEC Woes Since then, there has been a steady rise in the number of DeFi protocols being built on the blockchain. And as developers have flocked to the network, investors have followed suit, leading to a rapid rise in the number of staked ADA as users invested in various protocols. Although there were dips along the way, especially in the crypto winter of 2022, the tide has turned in 2023 and the number of staked ADA has now hit a new high. According to data from DeFiLlama, the total number of ADA staked on the network reached 560.7 million on Tuesday, July 4, a new all-time high. Total ADA staked in DeFi protocols reaches ATH | Source: DeFiLlama However, the new milestone is only reflected in the number of ADA staked and not in the total valued locked (TVL) in dollar terms. DeFiLlama shows that the current dollar equivalent of $161.82 million is still 50% below its March 2022 all-time high of $316.36 million. How Will ADA Price Respond? Like the altcoins in the crypto market, the price of ADA has responded closely to the movement of Bitcoin. As a result, over the last day, the digital asset has recorded a decline in its price. This is happening despite the latest TVL milestone. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Records Accelerated Burn Rate, But Price Fails To Respond This decline suggests that the price of ADA is not reacting positively to the new all-time high in Cardano TVL, meaning it remains isolated at this point. However, it could point to a bullish movement further out as the DeFi interest in the blockchain continues to grow. Currently, ADA is trading at a price of $0.28 which translates to a 3.30% decline in the last 24 hours. But on the 7-day chart, the altcoin is still seeing gains of around 5%. If the general market rallies again, then ADA is likely to retest the $0.3 resistance.

The stock has been a big winner this year through solid operating results amid the rally in Bitcoin prices. We like the stock given its segment leadership and mining scale advantages. Riot Platforms, Inc. ( RIOT ) is raising eyebrows with a fantastic 300% return year to date and gaining momentum in recent weeks. Recognized as one of the world’s largest Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners, the company is benefiting from the strong rally in the price of BTC and overall improved sentiment towards the broader crypto sector. We like RIOT for its segment leadership and see key advantages from its growing scale and vertically integrated business model that includes digital infrastructure and mining hosting services. Indeed, that was the thesis from our bullish article back in January with the update today highlighting recent developments we believe support a positive outlook. With an expectation for more upside in the price of Bitcoin, RIOT is well-positioned to continue outperforming. Data by YCharts Riot Platforms' Deal With MicroBT RIOT has announced a massive $163 million purchase order for 33,280 new mining machines through a partnership with “MicroBT Electronics Technology Co Ltd.”. The deal is set to nearly double its currently deployed hash rate capacity of 10.5 EH/s to approximately 20.1 EH/S by mid-2024. These include the latest “Whatsminer M56S+ and M56S++” models of application-specific integrated circuit ((ASIC)) bitcoin mining, with the latter setting a company benchmark in efficiency at 22.0 Joules/TH through immersion-cooling with a hash-rate capacity of 230TH/s each. source: MicroBT According to the press release, RIOT is also securing the option to purchase an additional 66,560 miners by the end of next year which would take the potential hash rate to a total 35.4 EH/s. This new set of miners from MicroBT represents a key part of an ongoing vision of being “the world’s leading Bitcoin-driven infrastructure platform”. The machines will be manufactured by MicroBT in the United States for deployment at Riot’s Corsicana, Texas facility currently under construction. Riot’s existing Rockdale, Texas site is already the largest Bitcoin mining facility in the world with an ongoing expansion expected to achieve a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 12.5 EH/s still this year. source: company IR What’s Next For Riot Platforms? A key point about Riot’s latest mining expansion is that it works to keep up with industry peers like Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) and Core Scientific, Inc. (CORZQ) in terms of announced hash rate deployments and potential long-term capacity. For context, MARA last announced an “operational hash-rate” of 15.2 EH/s and 20.1 EH/s on installed capacity including machines currently offline. Core Scientific, for its part, is reporting 14.9 EH/s of self-mining capacity and upwards of 22.1 EH/s including colocation-hosted services for its data center customers. In other words, Riot’s 20.1 EH/s in hash rate capacity expected by the end of next year for RIOT keeps the company within the top of the rankings. Looking further out, assuming Riot exercises its full agreement with MicroBT for 66,560 additional miners with upwards of 35.4 EH/s total capacity, the path here is to take the crown with the largest deployment the industry has seen with concrete terms thus far. This is important because the experience back at the height of the last bull market in late 2021 was a shortage of supply for new mining machines and some companies even making deals at inflated prices. By this measure, Riot has taken a proactive step signaling confidence the trend in Bitcoin is higher. Riot Platforms in Numbers To get a sense of the scale, RIOT reported mining 676 Bitcoins during May with an implied market value of $20.3 million at the current market price. The incremental capacity assuming the new machines from the MicroBT deal were immediately deployed at the current network difficult would allow Riot to mine upwards of 1,300 Bitcoin per month representing a market value of $39 million, or an annualized run rate of $468 million. This would be further supplemented by the separate business proceeds from engineering and hosting services including the participation in the Texas ERCOT demand response programs which reimburses the company for curtailing power usage during extreme conditions. All this is in the context of operating in an environment where the company is reporting a direct cost to produce a single Bitcoin at $9,438 in Q1 . Simply put, the investment in the mining machines with MicroBT essentially pays for itself within one first year. Notably, the company's investment plans are backed by a strong debt-free balance sheet with $188 million in cash and more than $200 million of liquidity by holding 7,094 Bitcoin at the last quarter's end. source: company IR These numbers are consistent with the current consensus estimating RIOT will reach $370 million in net revenue this year, climbing to $514 million in 2024. At the same time, Riot is not expected to reach GAAP profitability over this period considering the intensive Capex spending related to the new Corsicana infrastructure build-out. There are some big assumptions here but it’s also clear to see the upside potential in a scenario where Bitcoin prices take a leg higher. By our calculation, a Bitcoin price above $40k would be required to achieve a net income breakeven run rate immediately. The equity value trading at just 5x forward revenues net of cash is a bargain in our opinion for what we view as one of the higher-quality names in the segment. Seeking Alpha Riot and the Looming Bitcoin Halving Here we can bring up the proverbial ""white elephant"" in the room which is the looming Bitcoin halving expected by May 2024 where the network award will drop to 3.125 per block compared to the current 6.25 level. This means that over a full year, the number of Bitcoins to be mined will drop by half thereby limiting the earnings potential for all miners. This is a topic worthy of a separate discussion, but the idea for RIOT is that by at least doubling its capacity- the company will be able to at least keep up with the current revenue run rate as a baseline while also benefiting from climbing margins as the Capex requirements normalize. One line of thinking is that across the Bitcoin network, a large portion of ""legacy"" mining machines meaning older models from smaller operations will become obsolete and thus unable to profitably mine Bitcoin given the smaller reward potential. This opens the door for leaders like RIOT with the newest generation of efficient technology including the latest Whatsminer M56S++ to consolidate its network share as the difficulty level drops. There is also a thought that higher transaction fees will balance some of the lost revenue leading to higher prices consistent with the greater scarcity. scarcity including. Final Thoughts Riot's positioning today is a reflection of the groundwork the company has laid down over the last several years as a pioneer in the industry. Investors can take solace in that the management team has proven to be credible by delivering on important milestones while staying consistent with a long-term strategy. Our bullish conviction with RIOT starts with recognizing the upside in Bitcoin which we believe has emerged stronger from the ""crypto winter"" of 2022. Weathering the storm of the historic selloff last year, several crypto exchange failures, and the collapse of notable alternative cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin has cemented itself as a legitimate alternative asset class and the "" gold standard"" of digital assets ."" We see the direction of ongoing efforts towards regulation of crypto as ultimately benefiting Bitcoin further legitimizing its status, opening the door for further institutional interest and greater acceptance globally. Riot is poised to benefit from this environment, in our opinion. In terms of risks, there is plenty to cover. A monitoring point here is the price of Bitcoin itself. We can watch the $25k level as an important area of technical support the bulls will need to hold. A scenario where macro conditions deteriorate including higher financial market volatility would likely pressure Bitcoin prices through a form of financial contagion. For Riot, it will be important for the company to continue reaching its operational targets and deployments of announced mining machines. We want to see gross margins and cash flow trends improve sequentially over the next several quarters. To the upside, bulls can start thinking about the $20 stock price level as the next target which we believe is on the table by the end of this year with room for an expansion in valuation multiples.

42419975,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGlOn,1688593787,NFT Creator Royalty Payments Hit Two-Year Low: Nansen,"While enforcing non-fungible token (NFT) royalty payments have been a source of tension between platforms and creators for months, it appears that collectors have continued to forgo paying optional royalties.  According to a report from data analytics platform Nansen released Wednesday, NFT royalty payments sunk to a two-year low in June. Royalty payments reached their peak in April 2022, contributing to 28,000 ETH, or nearly $76 million, in one week of creator earnings. Meanwhile, June’s peak week saw creators collectively earn 2,000 ETH, or about $3.8 million.  The sharp decline in creator payouts has been exacerbated by the rise of royalty-optional marketplace Blur, as well as leading platform OpenSea’s policy. Currently, in order for creator earnings to be enforced on OpenSea, collections need to include an on-chain enforcement method in their smart contract, otherwise the royalty fee defaults to a minimum of 0.5%. On the other hand, Blur enforces minimum 0.5% royalties. In both cases, collectors can choose to contribute more to creator royalties, though it appears that the practice is uncommon.  Nansen analysts Javier Cerdan and Edward Wilson told CoinDesk that the competition has seen both marketplaces vying to keep royalty payments low while incentivizing trading.  “Royalties have been declining since February and Blur took a bigger share of royalties paid to be on par with OpenSea,” said Cerdan and Wilson. “Funny enough, in these last two weeks, Blur has been dominating the share of royalties paid.”  Despite a drop in June, Nansen reported that several blue-chip collections have raked in millions in royalty payments since their inception.  As of July 4, NFT behemoth Yuga Labs has raked in nearly $166 million in collective royalties across its collections, including Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and Otherdeed for Otherside. Additionally, NFT collective Chiru Labs has grossed over $58 million in royalties for its flagship Azuki collection, and derivative projects BEANZ and Elementals, according to Nansen.  The report specified that the dropoff of royalty payments began before Bored Ape Yacht Club’s floor price fell to a 20-month low and ahead of Azuki’s botched Elementals mint.  The conversation about whether to honor NFT royalties began to heat up in October, when Blur launched its zero-fee marketplace to court professional NFT traders, challenging leading marketplace OpenSea on its first day. After criticism from creators and collectors, Blur began allowing collections to opt in or out of enforcing creator fees.  Other NFT marketplaces, like X2Y2 and Magic Eden, have also recently changed their royalty enforcement policies after temporarily switching to zero-fee.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/05/nft-creator-royalty-payments-hit-two-year-low-nansen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fdd04c243259b9008746bedac21e114682f88ee7-2100x1500.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14553105,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4615338-h1-2023-state-of-privacy-coins?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1688590875,H1 2023: The State Of Privacy Coins,"Summary It's been a rough 2023 for the privacy coin market. Major headwinds include regulatory actions, exchange delisting, and consumer apathy. The Horizen blockchain developers recently announced the deprecation of the network's shielded coin pool; rendering ZEN no longer a ""privacy coin."" Zcash developer Electric Coin Company is reducing headcount, the SEC has labeled Dash an unregistered security, and NFTs on Monero risk degrading the network's privacy. It's been a rough 2023 for many altcoins in the cryptocurrency market. With US regulators ramping up enforcement actions against exchanges and designating certain coins to be unregistered securities in the process, many coins are at or near cycle lows at the midway point of the year. We've seen some of the recent securities designations of coins like Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), Cardano ( ADA-USD ), and Solana ( SOL-USD ) lead to their delisting by several US-based crypto exchanges. Being delisted led to sharp drops in coin prices. As a more niche segment of the altcoin market, ""Privacy coins"" have not done particularly well in 2023 either. The top 2 privacy coins by market capitalization are Monero ( XMR-USD ) and Zcash ( ZEC-USD ). Data by YCharts Each of those coins have dramatically lagged the year-to-date performance of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and for Zcash specifically, that YTD performance has actually seen the coin down by as much as 40% just a few weeks ago. Though ZEC and XMR are the biggest coins in the privacy segment, there are a couple of others worth mentioning as there have been some important developments. Exchange Delisting While general apathy toward the segment from the broader crypto community has always been a problem, in my view the biggest battle privacy coins face at this point is simple availability. Last September , crypto exchange Huobi announced it would stop offering privacy coins like XMR, ZEC, Dash ( DASH-USD ) and Horizen, among other coins. The main driver cited by the exchange was regulatory pressure and compliance concerns with AML/KYC policies. While Houbi is a formidable exchange for trading volume and pairings, the big hammer on privacy coins arguably came in late-May when top crypto exchange Binance ( BNB-USD ) said it would be delisting 12 privacy-centric coins. Among them, the four coins mentioned in the previous paragraph and many lesser-known coins like Decred ( DCR-USD ), Verge ( XVG-USD ), and Secret ( SCRT-USD ) in certain European countries including France, Italy, Poland, and Spain. Interestingly, just a few weeks later Binance partially reversed that late-May decision and announced that it would continue to allow trading of Decred, Dash, Zcash, Secret and Verge in the aforementioned EU countries. Notably missing from the exchange's privacy-coin walk-back were Monero and Horizen. One of the clear differences between coins like Monero and others like Zcash is the fact that Monero is private by default and lacks a transparent option. Zcash and Dash each have private or transparent optionality. Horizen Dropping Shielded Pools The regulatory environment for privacy coins has led to somewhat extraordinary measures being taken by the developers of the Horizen blockchain. Horizen's core developer is Horizen Labs. Horizen Labs was co-founded by Rob Viglione. In a medium post from January, Viglione detailed the decision to move Horizen away from a privacy-focused blockchain and instead position the network as more of a network of blockchains: ZenIP 42204 was put together in response to community concerns about privacy projects getting slammed by regulators. As Horizen has matured into a network of blockchains, is launching a smart contracting platform, and is aggressively pursuing enterprise, government, and academic use cases, there's a growing sense that all of this could be smashed by regulators for a feature that almost no one uses. It turns out that less than 0.4% of ZEN is parked in the shielded pool. 99.6% of ZEN is not. The shielded pool usage is an important metric to consider because the Sprout technology that Horizen has been using is similar to what Zcash has through its ZEC shielded pool. However, on Zcash, the shielded supply of the coins outstanding is closer to 10%. It could be argued Horizen is taking a somewhat pragmatic approach to navigating the regulatory climate since the chain isn't really being used for shielded transactions. What's important to note regarding Horizen's shielded ZEN pool is that in deprecating the pool, ZEN can't go into the shielded pool, but it can come out of the pool. This means the holders of the 0.4% of the ZEN that is shielded won't lose their coins. According to Horizen, this pool will be deprecated on testnet in August and on mainnet in September through a mandatory software upgrade. Horizen Development & Grayscale Ownership The decision to eliminate shielded pooling of ZEN on mainnet may speak to a larger issue with Horizen; there doesn't appear to be any meaningful application built on the network and the push for the EVM-compatible EON sidechain might be too little too late for Horizen. Horizen Development (Santiment) Still, though there isn't much to speak of from an application standpoint, there has been a noticeably positive trend in the Horizen network pertaining to development contributors. During the depths of the last crypto bear market, the active contributor count on Horizen was generally in the 3 to 5 contributor range on a 7-day timeframe. However, that figure is now generally closer to 25 on a regular basis. Data by YCharts Despite being a relatively small network, ZEN exposure has been available on the public equity market through Grayscale's Horizen Trust ( OTCQX:HZEN ) shares. HZEN is one of the few Grayscale funds that still trades at a premium to net asset value. However, there is a slight concentration concern with HZEN. Not only do related parties own 3.6 million of the 6.8 million outstanding HZEN shares, but Grayscale currently has just under 605k of the 13.8 million ZEN in circulation sitting in the fund. Figures in millions AUM CMC Grayscale owns Ethereum Classic ( ETC-USD )( ETCG ) $229 $2,700 8.48% Horizen $5.5 $117 4.70% Bitcoin ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">OTC:GBTC ) $19,290 $589,610 3.27% Ethereum ( ETH-USD )( OTCQX:ETHE ) $5,820 $228,810 2.54% Livepeer (LPT-USD)( LPT )"" target=""_blank"">OTCQB:GLIV ) $2.7 $131 2.06% Sources: CoinGlass, CoinMarketCap In the table above, I'm showing Grayscale fund AUM and the total market capitalizations for the underlying assets. In the far right column, we can see a rough estimate for how much of a coin's circulating supply is owned by Grayscale. At nearly 5%, the only coin that is more concentrated to Grayscale than Horizen is Ethereum Classic. Without organic demand for ZEN, the price of the token is going to continue to experience pressure as Grayscale takes its management fee from the HZEN fund and liquidates ZEN to pay itself. Privacy's ""Top 3"" I recently covered Zcash for Seeking Alpha back in May , and I'd encourage you to read that article as well for a more ZEC-focused assessment. At the time, I believed the bottom was likely in on ZEC and that has proven to not be the case. A major development for Zcash, since that article was published, was the late-May announcement that Electric Coin Company would be laying off about half of its staffers. Electric Coin Company, or ECC, is the lead developer of Zcash. Roughly two weeks after that announcement, ZEC had fallen another 30% from $31 down to $21. It has since recovered back to the mid $30's. Data by YCharts The reduction in ECC's workforce could possibly be viewed as a bit of a make or break moment ZEC. If ZEC has a future, it's going to require the broader Zcash community stepping up and decentralizing the network development. Dash is facing headwinds as well. About a month before the ECC announcement, as part of a lawsuit against crypto exchange Bittrex, the SEC alleged that DASH is an unregistered security. In my view, it's difficult to justify that allegation given DASH lacks many of the characteristics that are often common among the SEC's other unregistered security declarations. For instance, DASH is a proof-of-work coin that had no ICO and that has a large level of decentralization judging by retail holdings and mining pool distribution. DASH is far more like BTC than it is like MATIC - the latter of which the SEC believes to be a security while BTC gets a pass. Nevertheless, DASH is down about 40% since the Bittrex lawsuit in April. Data by YCharts 2023 hasn't been without an element of drama for privacy coin leader Monero either. Though XMR is holding up far better than peers. In what could possibly be viewed as an attempt at piggybacking the Ordinals phenomenon on Bitcoin, a user in the Monero community launched the Mordinals NFT project on Monero earlier this year. Like Ordinals before it in the Bitcoin community, Mordinals has come with a considerable amount of pushback from within the Monero community. That pushback has varied from justifiable concern about privacy degradation to outright disgust at what some have alleged to be a deliberate attack on the network under the guise of an NFT project. Data by YCharts Despite the presence of NFTs on the Monero blockchain, XMR had a strong June and at one point rattled off 13 consecutive green daily candles between June 15th and June 27th. XMR has unquestionably held up better than other privacy coins in the market over the last 12 months and the currency commands a $3 billion market cap and a crypto market cap rank of 26 according to CoinMarketCap. Investor Takeaways Privacy isn't just normal, it's necessary. It's required for both individuals and businesses in a truly free society. And privacy also happens to be a major drawback in using most distributed ledger technology as currently constructed. If tokenization is going to reach any kind of critical mass with self-sovereignty embedded for the participants, privacy solutions are required. Whether this privacy comes from base layer utility or network-native applications remains to be seen. We know mixers like Tornado Cash are not going to be tolerated by most regulators. Privacy coins were a very unloved segment in crypto a year ago. I'd argue they're even less loved today. These coins are battling exchange delisting, regulatory headwinds, and consumer apathy. These headwinds have led to Horizen dropping privacy as a network feature entirely. I maintain privacy on-chain is one of the great challenges facing the entire industry. My personal pick is still Zcash. But Monero is winning for a reason and that could certainly continue given the strength of the community that champions that network.",NEGATIVE,BTC | XMR | ZEC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | XMR | ZEC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4615338-h1-2023-state-of-privacy-coins?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14553105.jpeg

Previously known to be a skeptic of crypto, Fink years ago suggested fans of the asset class heavily used it for “illicit activities.”  Fink continued: “Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country, or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you’re in – let’s be clear, bitcoin is an international asset, it’s not based on any one currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.”  The iShares unit of BlackRock filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 16 for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. While BlackRock has an almost perfect track record of getting ETFs approved by the SEC, Fink couldn’t say when a decision for its bitcoin ETF could be expected.  “We hope that, like in the past, we could be working with our regulators and get the filing approved one day, and I have no idea what that one day will be, but we’ll see how that all plays out.”  The apparent bullishness of the CEO of the $8.5 trillion asset manager is having little effect on the price of bitcoin, which continues to trade little-changed at just under $30,500.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/05/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-says-bitcoin-could-revolutionize-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c8d5c11c0f71844d5dd59e4b51ba62ba8995aa6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419980,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGlRt,1688587653,Why Lisbon Is Immunefi's Crypto Hub,"Crypto Founders on Crypto Hubs is a series of interviews with entrepreneurs about where their startup is located and why. It is part of Crypto Hubs 2023. In this installment, CoinDesk senior editor Jeanhee Kim interviewed Mitchell Amador, founder and CEO of bug bounty platform Immunefi. Their conversation was transcribed and edited for clarity and length.  Tell me where Immunefi is.  Immunefi is all remote. We have team members in America, Central America, South America, Central European groups and a large British group. We are incorporated in Singapore.  But arguably the hub where we have the most aggregation is Lisbon and the wider area. We’ve got team members who are Portuguese, who are into crypto for a variety of reasons. We have foreigners, people who have made Portugal their escape. And now, this totally new class, nomads, who don’t live in Portugal but are here for x months a year.  Mitchell Amador is a Canada-born crypto entrepreneur who lives in Portugal, where he founded Immunefi in 2020. Immunefi is a bug bounty crowdsourcing platform for decentralized finance. An avid ecosystem builder, Amador is a core member and officer of the New Economy Institute that has been helping shape the technology and regulatory landscape in Portugal with the goal of helping Portugal become a better crypto hub.  If Portugal is your hub, why did you not incorporate there?  From a regulatory, taxation perspective, do we want to set up our corporation in a country where it's extremely difficult to fire people – at-will clauses or contracts with a bunch of arcane taxation rules – complete with the general regulatory policy oversight of do-nothing-until-you-have-permission? These are deal breakers from an incorporation perspective, but where places like Delaware excel, Singapore excels.  So you aren't incorporated in Portugal but what are the reasons you have made it Immunefi's hub?  Portugal has made huge strides over the last year concerning the implementation of new and friendly crypto taxation laws, which is a huge boon to the community and among the most important things they could do to make Portugal a more effective crypto hub. The Portuguese state is actively engaging with the community, primarily through the advocacy non-profit Instituto New Economy, which I co-founded – to show serious skin in the game – and which is backed by companies like Brave, Gnosis, Balancer, Near, and a host of Portuguese institutions like major universities and law firms, to further improve Portugal's standing in the industry. This includes exciting new work around local MiCA [Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation] implementation, which Portugal has a lot of influence over, and the regulatory side. These are key initiatives for improving Portugal's attractiveness from a corporate and incorporation perspective. So the trajectory for crypto in Portugal is pretty bright, and it's easy to see that Portugal is a leader in Europe – and increasingly beyond – due to these factors. And much of that is due to an active and receptive state involvement.  What's your advice to a founder deciding where they should incorporate or locate?  The Number One question is: Where is your hub? To make it sustainable for a crypto founder, that should be where you live. And you should live in a healthy place. With healthy people. Portugal really excels on that whole gradient. When you compare it to a London or a Paris, our level of social harmony is much higher. The Portuguese are more united. They have a greater sense of camaraderie. They're less violent; they're less angry. These are a very calm, chill, relaxed people. Walk around and it rubs off on you.  In many ways, Lisbon is uniquely advantageous for a market like crypto, the fastest market in the history of man. Take the fastest-paced market and put it in the fastest city like New York and you’ve basically got the recipe of human misery.  Put the crypto founder in Portugal and he will survive. It's still going to be troublesome when he goes on Twitter, but then he's going to go to the beach. I've seen this play out very tangibly. The overwhelming reason why founders are moving to Portugal is it’s just a great place to live.  But on the flip side, incorporate wherever you have to to get the thing off the ground. What you need to do in the early stages is just get out the door. Focus on getting customers and figure out if what will happen is real. And once you have that, then minimize future consequences. So everybody picks the Delaware option. Singapore is like the Delaware of Southeast Asia.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  Singapore is CoinDesk’s second-highest ranking crypto hub. Why didn’t you choose it for your hub?  Singapore is amazing for incorporation, with the added advantage that it's not America. America is a very dangerous place. It has a whole bunch of weird arcane rules. And most of the world is not familiar with the common law system so it's quite unusual. But it's still awesome to get clean corporate documentation, very reliable reports. A contract there is as good as gold. They have amazing business infrastructure. Tons of products and tools are set up so that you can easily onboard with banks, accounting providers, software providers, etc. It’s so smooth.  And Singapore is a version of that. It's, like, half as good. So still pretty good in the grand scheme of things.  From Singapore's perspective, the whole world is foreign to it. So you can engage with the world as a business in Singapore in an excellent way as opposed to, in the U.S., having a different set of restrictions for foreign country owners in the world's largest market.  The downside is that Singapore is very transactional. They've decided they're interested in crypto as financial rails infrastructure. But they also decided that they don't like crypto’s funny business and they don't really like the level of experimentation. They've got these laws – the MAS’s (Monetary Authority of Singapore) Payment Services Act – that are just sitting in the background waiting. Like: When we get tired of this, if we don't see the value here that we're looking for, we’re going to slam it down.

42419985,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGla9,1688587307,"Bitcoin Remains Range-Bound, Despite Bullish Sentiment","BTC support has increased at $30,000.  BTC open interest increases, while funding rates remain positive.  Early Wednesday trading in U.S. markets underscored increasing stability for bitcoin at $30,000. Meanwhile, derivatives markets signaled bullishness, despite BTC’s stoutness.  Bitcoin traded flat on Wednesday, marking the 12th consecutive day of range-bound trading. Since the 22% price increase between June 15 and June 23, BTC prices have traded down 1.3%.  Trading volume spiked during Wednesday’s 9 a.m. (ET) hour, as U.S.-based markets opened. The rise coincides with a prior-hour decline to $30,349, along with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) falling below 30 on its hourly chart – indicating that BTC was oversold in the lower time frame.  Short-term intraday traders likely saw the decline as an opportunity to get long BTC at an opportune valuation. Investors looking to hold bitcoin for longer than one day would be more likely to view BTC’s RSI on a daily chart, where it sits at 62.  The RSI is a commonly used technical indicator ranging from 0-100, with levels above 70 implying that an asset is overvalued, and levels below 30 implying that it is undervalued. Applying the indicator on varying time frames can hint at the sentiment of traders with different time horizons or investing styles.  Derivatives markets signal bullishness  While spot BTC prices have moderated, investors looking for exposure via derivatives markets appear to be betting on higher prices.  Futures open interest for bitcoin is now north of $12 billion, up from $10.4 billion at the beginning of June. Open interest had reached as high as $13.4 billion on June 29, according to On-Chain Analytics firm Glassnode.  Futures volume has been choppy, not indicating a trend in either direction. Still, its most recent reading of $19 billion doesn’t indicate a sharp decline in activity.  Rising open interest along with rising prices can often signal investor bullishness.  Bitcoin funding rates have been positive for 29 consecutive days, and for all but one day since May 11.  Funding rates represent periodic payments between traders with long or short positions in futures markets. Positive funding rates indicate that long position traders are willing to pay a funding rate to short position traders, an indication of bullish sentiment  This article was written and edited by CoinDesk journalists with the sole purpose of informing the reader with accurate information.

The new version focuses on improving performance and user experience, with a significant 10x increase in throughput achieved through the implementation of the Sequencer in Rust. Starknet Upgrade Signals Boost for Ethereum’s Scalability According to the company’s blog post, the Sequencer has been optimized with the help of LambdaClass, resulting in a smoother user experience by removing the PENDING status for transactions. A new syscall has also been introduced to retrieve past block hashes easily. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Will Reach $100, Here’s Why Furthermore, the new version of Starknet supports a new Cairo syntax that focuses on safety. This means that the new syntax is designed to make it easier for developers to write secure smart contracts that are less prone to errors and vulnerabilities. The network upgrade to Starknet v12.0 will undergo a community vote, ensuring widespread participation and input. The community will have the opportunity to shape the future of Starknet, and the upgrade protocol for breaking changes includes a six-month window in which contracts compiled with the older compiler version (v1.1.0) will still be accepted. Starknet’s vision is to achieve substantial scalability in scale and cost, with the next priority being reducing transaction costs. The long-term goal is to provide a scalable, flexible, cost-effective infrastructure for decentralized applications. The upcoming vote for Starknet Alpha V0.12.0 will allow the community to examine and test the upgraded version before approving it for Mainnet deployment. Everyone is invited to participate in the proposal and vote on whether to upgrade Starknet Mainnet accordingly. Starknet empowers developers to code solutions that make a difference, and the new version allows developers to start their Cairo development journey. With the Cairo docs, Cairo Basecamp, and tutorials, developers can stay up to date with all version updates by signing up for the Starknet Developers Newsletter. The release of Starknet Alpha V0.12.0 represents a significant milestone for StarkWare and Ethereum, with the layer-2 solution’s focus on performance and user experience promising to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs for decentralized applications. Ethereum Prices Surge, But Network Activity Shows No Significant Boost According to recent data from Glassnode, despite the recent rise in Ethereum prices, network activity has not experienced a significant boost, with gas prices remaining relatively low. This contrasts the situation during the Shanghai upgrade in April, which preceded a similar rally in ETH markets, where gas prices rose by 78%. Gas prices on the Ethereum network measure the cost of executing smart contracts and transactions. When demand for transaction processing exceeds the available network capacity, gas prices rise as users compete to process their transactions more quickly. This often happens during high network activity periods, such as upgrades and market rallies. Related Reading: Valkyrie Follows In BlackRock’s Footsteps, Refiles For Spot Bitcoin ETF However, the recent rally in Ethereum prices does not seem to have led to a significant increase in network activity, as gas prices have remained relatively stable. This could be due to several factors, such as that the current rally is driven more by institutional investors and DeFi protocols rather than individual users. Additionally, there may be more network capacity available now than during the Shanghai upgrade, which could be helping to keep gas prices in check. Despite the low gas prices, there are still signs of growth and development within the Ethereum ecosystem. The recent release of the Starknet v12.0 testnet by StarkWare, for example, is a significant milestone for Ethereum, as it promises to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs for decentralized applications built on the network.

In a forum post, a project leader called on Abracadabra DAO to support a “transition of power” to a centralized entity complete with lawyers, jurisdictions and trustees. Those trappings of a traditional corporation are seemingly antithetical to the notion of a DAO, the form of crypto-based business governance in which token holders directly call the shots.  “Despite our commitment to decentralization, we’ve recognized the importance of introducing a certain degree of centralized legal structure,” the AbracadabraTeam account wrote. “The purpose here is not to disrupt the decentralized nature of Abracadabra; in fact, it’s to protect it.”  Abracadabra DAO is the latest crypto project swapping the lofty idealism of decentralized governance for some degree of centralization, alongside SushiSwap and other projects. The reasons for these transitions range from heightened regulatory scrutiny to more mundane business concerns.  For Abracadabra DAO, the publicly-shared reasons seem to tilt toward vanilla. AbracadabraTeam said the centralized entity would manage the DAO’s intellectual property as well as server expenses “while still keeping control in the hands of SPELL token holders.”  Holders of SPELL (Abracadabra DAO’s governance token) will vote the project through three phases of transition, starting with picking a jurisdiction for the new entity. Four countries are on the table: Switzerland, Singapore, Malta and Bermuda.  Phases two and three will define what the new entity’s roles are and how it will operate, according to the post.

42419982,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGlX3,1688583694,The Broke Ape Yacht Crash: Lessons for Justin Bieber and Other NFT Collectors,"Bitter finger-pointing and recrimination are swirling among and around investors in Bored Ape Yacht Club, the “profile pic” (PFP) NFT collection that skyrocketed to immense values in early 2022. The market for Apes has been brutally hammered by a lull in NFT interest, with floor prices – the lowest price for which an Ape can be purchased – declining to 27.4 ETH, from a high of 153.7 ETH in April of 2022.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Floor price is a proxy for the overall value of an NFT collection, so that 82% floor decline can translate into even bigger drops in the value of individual Bored Apes and related assets. In one notable example, Justin Bieber owns an Ape that was supposedly worth $1.3 million at one point, and now the highest bid for it is just over $58,000 – a 95% decline.  It should be noted that early Ape holders are still in decent shape, and Bored Apes are still very highly valued and traded relative to other NFT collections. They were also far from the only crypto-asset to experience a wild runup and crash over the last few years. And they are slumping roughly in line with the broader NFT market, which by some measures is at its lowest point in two years.  But there are crucial lessons to be learned here that are specific to BAYC. Many buyers, particularly those who aped hardest, have paid immense sums in “market tuition” to (hopefully) learn them. If you’re lucky enough to learn them for free, take heed.  1. Pride Cometh Before the Fall  Perhaps not a straightforward market lesson, but still the most important: One reason people are so attuned to the failure of the Apes right now is the questionable behavior of holders when times were good.  Some of the negative feeling towards Apes is thanks to rather typical crypto bull market behavior, such as extravagantly lame parties. But, fair or not, Ape-holders have also gained a reputation for being particularly toxic and self-absorbed. In the minds of many, a Bored Ape is the visual counterpart to unironically tweeting “have fun staying poor” at anyone with the temerity to ask why a monkey jpeg is worth half a million dollars.  This kind of behavior may have been an understandable defensive reaction to the huge wave of mainstream mockery that targeted the Apes, but it was a tactical mistake (as it is with Bitcoin). The lack of goodwill towards Apes, whether within crypto communities or more broadly, is now translating directly into weaker financial support for the assets.  That’s because there is clear truth to the rhetoric around NFTs and “community”: The community of holders really, really matters to these things’ value. To cite just two notable examples of more robust PFP communities, Wassies and Miladies have held up vastly better in value than Apes over the past year, though admittedly from a much lower starting point.  So ask yourself: if the guy next to you bought his Ape because he couldn’t tell Paris Hilton was basically joking on the teevee, is that a community you really want to be in?  2. Aggressive marketing is a red flag  One reason Bored Apes came in for such scrutiny among crypto veterans in particular is that they were so aggressively marketed to a mainstream audience. That was most notoriously crystallized in the infamously awkward Paris Hilton segment on Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show.  That moment was seized on by both mainstream skeptics and crypto veterans because it was so transparently fake. The insincerity was palpable, as it almost always is in such situations. (Personally, I think Paris tanked it on purpose. She’s nobody’s fool.)  There are clear financial reasons to avoid projects that engage in this sort of inorganic marketing: it can inflate an asset market, but also makes it more fragile. In the case of crypto-assets, it can mean winding up with a lot of low-conviction holders who don’t actually understand the value proposition of what they’ve purchased.  At the same time, inorganic hype tends to encourage speculation rather than participation, which makes a market weaker. A market rooted in cultural value is far more enduring when individual holders had individual journeys to genuine affection for some object, rather than just seeing a commercial for it.  And when a Bored Ape pops up on a talk show, someone with deep pockets may buy a dozen of them instead of just one for themselves. But this simultaneously raises the barrier to entry for new holders, and creates concentrated points of market failure for the asset.  This was illustrated in April of this year when a major Bored Ape holder sold dozens of the NFTs in just a few days, pushing markets to a five-month low. A healthy NFT ecosystem has broad organic demand and an engaged community of predominantly individual holders – not a critical mass of speculators with heavy bags, poised to dump when the wind starts blowing the wrong direction.  3. Don’t leverage speculative assets  The most mortifying stories coming out of the BAYC community right now are of people who used their Apes as collateral for loans, and are now getting liquidated as BAYC values drop. In just one instance, BendDAO, as spotted by Protos, is selling off dozens of Apes that have been seized as collateral for un-repaid loans. Bend is just one of a few similar services, and these liquidations may even be driving BAYC values into a downward spiral.  The entire idea that NFTs were viable as financial primitives this early in their asset lifecycle is deeply questionable, though offering the service seems perfectly valid (and potentially quite lucrative). But, oh my god, is it ever a bad idea for a borrower to go into debt against a volatile asset, crypto or not. Now these borrower’s Apes are being force-sold at the bottom of the market, instead of waiting for a better moment.  4. If you’re not first, you’re last  The Apes in real trouble right now, of course, are the ones who bought at the top of the market. Some of them are down even worse than Justin Bieber, and a lot of that money is never coming back.  There’s no easy metric or standard for knowing when you’re buying into an overheated market. See above re: aggressive marketing for a start, though: whether you’re seeing an Ape pumped on late night TV or an AI startup CEO making hyperbolic claims, tread carefully. That very messaging is probably helping inflate the asset in question beyond its actual underlying value.  Perhaps the most conservative way to think about this is that if other people are already “making” crazy amounts of money on a bet, it’s almost certainly too late for you to catch even the crumbs of that surge, whatever the asset in question - and you’re at risk of being the one who gets dumped on.  That goes double for community-oriented NFTs, because if you’re aping into a rising asset in the expectation of future returns, everyone around you is probably doing the same thing. Even more than in most markets, in other words, an NFT bubble is self-defeating because it poisons the earth in which an organic community can grow.  In other words, the Bored Apes are now simply reaping what they sowed: that is, not very much.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

14549688,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541369,1688583614,Crypto Market Trade Volume Hits Lowest Point Since 2020 Amid Market Turbulence,"In recent months, the crypto markets have witnessed significant turbulence leading to the lowest quarterly trade volume since 2020. Amid varying economic factors, a bearish perception of investors toward cryptocurrencies and the broader economic climate reflects a dynamic yet challenging landscape. Kaiko, a crypto market data provider, shed light on this development alongside various key industry trends. Despite the lowered trade volumes, the crypto industry concluded the quarter positively, demonstrating resilience. Challenges Faced By TrueUSD And Impact On Crypto Market Prime Trust, the crypto custodian of TrueUSD (TUSD), has encountered financial difficulties, placing the stablecoin under scrutiny. The custodian’s financial shortfall, amounting to approximately $82 million, led to significant challenges, with customers unable to execute withdrawals. Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap Poised For Breakout: Analyst Predict 23% Upside Potential The challenges also included considerable sales pressure on TrueUSD on decentralized exchanges after the disclosure that True USD’s present auditing firm is a restructured version of FTX’s auditor. However, despite the selling pressure on decentralized exchanges, the price of TUSD remained around $0.999. Kaiko revealed that the potential liquidation of Prime Trust’s holdings could significantly impact the token’s price due to the holdings’ scale. Mixed Performances And Emerging Trends In the realm of performance, the second quarter witnessed a drop in the open interest for altcoins. Layer 2 tokens, which had initially reported gains in the first quarter, experienced a reduction ranging from 20% to 40% during Q2, according to Kaiko. On the flip side, DeFi tokens wrapped up the quarter marking a decline of 8%, yet picked up steam in June, largely fueled by the rise of tokens like MakerDAO’s MKR and Compound’s COMP. COMP experienced a boost of over 50% as large-scale investors in Binance intensified their purchasing activities. Kaiko further revealed that the Korean won (KRW)-denominated trade volume surpassed USD in the quarter’s final week, primarily spurred by WAVES and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The spike in volume was largely attributed to WAVES’ price jump after securing support from DWF Labs, while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) saw a massive rise following its listing on EDX Markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Up 55% Following BlackRock’s ETF Application, EDX Markets Launch Meanwhile, EUR-denominated volume on centralized exchanges recorded a two-year low since the crypto bull run in late 2020. This trend indicates a shift in European market sentiment, adding to the quarter’s varied developments. Regardless, the crypto market has shown recovery from its bloodbath last year. Over the last 7 months, the crypto market has grown compared to the bearish trend seen all through 2022. Both small caps and Larger crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have broken multiple resistance surpassing important levels. Bitcoin has recently traded above $31,000 before retracing below $30,427 at the time of writing. Ethereum, on the other hand, has also surged and trades above the $1,900 mark and now looking to break past the $2,000 region.

On July 14, the McQueen Estate – in partnership with Web3 talent agency Verified Labs, contemporary artist Michael Kalish, Triumph Motorcycles and Web3 animation studio Immersive Entertainment Laboratories (IEL) – will release a collection of 1,000 generative art collectibles with varying rarity traits remembering the late actor. Sold on the ThetaDrop platform, the project was inspired by an original portrait Kalish created of McQueen in 2022 with help from McQueen's grandson, Chase.  Collectors of the “King of Cool Racing Team” NFTs will receive a digital motorcycle shipping crate that they can pry open to reveal a one-of-a-kind, virtual Triumph Bonneville T100 Motorcycle. Revealing the bike will grant them membership into the King of Cool Racing Team and provide them with access to future token-gated content, events and games. Each collectible also comes with a 3D Steve McQueen portrait, which can be viewed in even greater detail using a virtual reality headset or Sony's Spatial Reality Display.  McQueen, who was known for his starring roles in movies like ""The Cincinnati Kid,"" ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Towering Inferno,"" was also an avid motorcycle enthusiast. He participated in a number of races and collected many Triumph motorcycles and hot rods in his personal garage in Palm Springs, California.  Justin Trevor Winters, co-founder and CEO of Verified Labs, told CoinDesk that Chase, who runs McQueen Racing with his father Chad, wanted to memorialize the movie star in a new format.  ""The truth is, it's all about legacy,"" he said. ""We wanted to make sure we did our part to help McQueen live on for future generations. The advancements in AI and technology allow for this to happen in a very personal and immersive way.""

""Having the opportunity to partner with the Steve McQueen family has been a perfect intersection of my passions as an artist and who Steve McQueen was to all of us on the big screen. There is so much overlap in our love of cars, motorcycles, family, American Iconic objects and moments,"" Kalish said.

""Up until now, workers in the crypto industry had to pay double the tax on their options compared to workers in the traditional high-tech industry. Moreover, foreign investors in the blockchain industry were not entitled to the same benefits as those entitled to investors in the traditional high-tech industry,"" Illouz said in a press statement.

In a recent turn of events, Valkyrie, an alternative asset management company specializing in the emerging cryptocurrency sector, refiled its application for a Spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Valkyrie Takes Another Swing At Bitcoin ETF Approval In a new 19b-4 form submitted by the Tennessee-based firm, the latest Bitcoin ETF filing includes some key differences that may improve its chances of approval by the SEC. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Notches 16% Gains On Weekly Chart, Will It Cross $20? For starters, Valkyrie mentions it is now bringing on Coinbase as a partner for market surveillance in support of the fund. The company also mentions that Coinbase had “executed a term sheet with Nasdaq” to “enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement.” Given that Coinbase is the largest cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States, Valkyrie’s partnership with Coinbase is most likely going to increase the likelihood that the application will be approved. Valkyrie is, however, not new to the BTC business, as the company is majorly focused on bridging the gap between traditional finance and the rapidly evolving digital asset industry. In 2022, the company received approval from the SEC for its Bitcoin Futures Fund. In 2021, Valkyrie filed for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, but it was outrightly rejected by the SEC for the reason of being too risky for investors for various reasons such as market manipulation.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Up 5%, But Social Media Talk Remains Low: Santiment With major investment companies entering the fray and refiling their applications, the SEC will likely face mounting pressure to approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF finally. As investors’ demand for digital assets grows, a spot ETF could provide a regulated way to gain exposure to BTC and lead to even more mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially for institutional investors. If any of these filings are approved, it would be the first Bitcoin spot ETF to win approval in the US and the fund(s) will be able to offer unlimited Bitcoin ETF shares to investors.

42420001,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUIzPB,1688579049,Former FTX.US President’s New Venture Is Seeking to Harness AI for Crypto Trading,"Many people are convinced that artificial intelligence (AI) is going to have a profound impact on almost every industry, and crypto trading is no exception. Brett Harrison, the former President of FTX.US who stepped down just months before its parent company collapsed, thinks using AI could make coding algorithmic trading strategies easier.  His new venture, Architect, officially started in January 2023 with a $5 million seed round from Coinbase Ventures and Anthony Scaramucci, among others, and aims to bring investment tools to individual traders and large institutions, Harrison told CoinDesk in an interview. Architect’s platform has been available for select clients in beta mode since May.  Around February or May, when interest in AI was at its zenith, Architect saw an opportunity to write algorithmic trading code for crypto, using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT - the chatbot created by Sam Altman’s OpenAI. Often the hardest part about creating such algorithms is the initial step, going from zero to one, because it requires specialized skills and knowledge that not all trading firms have in-house, he said.  “Our idea was to leverage the OpenAI API's [application programming interfaces] and combine them with our internal trading API's that we've built on top of all these different protocols to make it possible to use natural language probes to generate trading strategy code,” Harrison said. For example, using Architect’s platform, traders could set up software that buys bitcoin on Coinbase (COIN) when its price drops below what it is on other crypto exchanges.  Early stages  But Architect is still in the “early exploration” phase of AI tools, and envisions it as part of a suite of features on its platform. Another AI-powered tool it is considering based on customer feedback is actually using large language models (LLMs) for advanced market indicators, or actually embedding LLMs directly into the trading process, Harrison said.  LLMs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard are artificial neural networks trained on large datasets of language, such that they can understand and generate human-like texts. Due to their proficiency with language, LLMs can understand complex concepts and explain them to users in an approachable way.  Read more: AI Can Generate a Trading Edge in Crypto Markets  “The main thesis is to build good software that helps enable institutions to be prepared for a world that mixes traditional and digital assets seamlessly,” Harrison said. “But we do think that AI is going to be a critical component of most businesses going forward, and we didn't want to miss the opportunity to be able to leverage AI tools for our users.”  Ultimately, the success of the trading strategies depends on the team behind it, not just the generative AI used to build it. The results you're going to get from something like OpenAI’s Chat GPT are only going to be as good as the prompts that you're giving it, Harrison noted.  “You definitely need to review the strategy, make sure it's working, tweak it, test it,” he said.  The FTX connection  Regardless of the new trading platform, the shadow of FTX - the company that saw one of the crypto world’s most highly publicized collapses - has followed Harrison and Architect.  Harrison resigned from the position of President at FTX.US in late September 2022, just months before the exchange’s collapse. Six of eight Architect employees listed on its website used to work at FTX US.  Asked about his connection to FTX and fundraising, Harrison said that some investors couldn’t shake it, but others were able to.  “I spoke publicly about the way that Sam had a real power over the industry, prior to the collapse, and how that affected even my raise process, and people asking about what connection Sam would have to the company before the collapse. And then, post collapse, some of those same investors were concerned about my association with FTX. But those were just a few” from everyone he spoke to, he said.  “We were able to raise, you know, very successfully, in what was otherwise, some of the most difficult times for the industry, for raising money in general, not just in crypto, but across the VC [venture capital] landscape,” said Harrison.

Interest In Dogecoin Remains Low Despite Surge In Price According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, there haven’t been many discussions around DOGE on social media recently. The relevant indicator here is “social dominance,” which tells us about the percentage of the total discussions happening on social media platforms related to the top 100 assets (by market cap) that involve the topic of Dogecoin. When the value of this metric is high, it means that the DOGE-related talks currently make up a significant part of the discussions involving the wider cryptocurrency market. Such a trend is usually a sign that the interest in the asset is high among the general investor. On the other hand, low values imply that social media users aren’t talking that much about the meme coin. Naturally, this kind of trend suggests that there is no excitement around the coin in the market at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in Dogecoin’s social dominance over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been relatively low in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin social dominance has been quite low during the past month. Currently, the indicator’s value is around 1.4%, which means that DOGE-related discussions make up for just 1.4% of all talks related to the top 100 assets. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here? These recent low values of the metric are particularly notable as the meme coin has observed an increase of about 5% during the last week or so. It would appear that despite this rise, interest in the cryptocurrency hasn’t particularly shifted one way or the other. In the chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another indicator: the “Binance funding rate.” This metric keeps track of the periodic fee that Dogecoin futures traders are exchanging with each other on the Binance platform. From the graph, it’s visible that this indicator became quite negative a while back, implying that a large number of short contracts piled up. Before long, however, the metric turned back positive as the price observed its latest rally. This timing would suggest that a “short squeeze” might have helped with the recent price growth. A short squeeze is an event where a mass liquidation of short contracts takes place at once and ends up providing fuel for an upward price move. Even though this was the largest short squeeze of 2023, it would appear that social media users have remained uninterested in the asset. This may not be all bad for Dogecoin, though, as excessive social media hype usually ends up in a top formation for the meme coin.

42420012,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUIzXR,1688576378,The Digital Euro and the P Word,"Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have had quite a few growing pains. Somehow all the significant problems start with the letter “p” – privacy, programmability, and, above all, politics.  Privacy is especially problematic with CBDCs issued for retail payment use in developed economies, including the so-called “digital euro.”  Dea Markova is a managing director and head of digital assets at Forefront Advisers.  In end-June, the European Commission proposed legislation on the digital euro, so that it could be issued legally should it ever be issued. The European Central Bank has been investigating the possibility of a digital euro, and this October it will near-certainly conclude that the investigation has been a success, and a realization phase will begin. How long will that phase last - only politics can tell.  In public consultations on the digital euro, privacy came up as the most important feature for both citizens and professionals.  Why is privacy a problem? We talk about privacy because most CBDCs would be issued as a blockchain-based token which allows the issuer, i.e. the central bank, to have all the data on how this token changes hands. Europe is not even formally committing to using tokenization, and privacy concerns are one of the reasons for this.  Read more: Dea Markova - In the 'Stablecoin Olympics,' No Winner Will Take All  Legally, however, it is extremely unlikely that mass surveillance will ever be permissible by a G7 central bank. The EU rulebook will certainly make sure this is not the case.  Institutionally, the ECB has zero interest and insufficient resources to launch a CBDC so it can snoop on the individual spending decisions of eurozone citizens. To argue otherwise is unsubstantiated speculation, inconsistent with the way the ECB behaves.  Technologically, privacy in online payments can be convincingly safeguarded. The ECB has made it extremely clear that the digital euro will be distributed via intermediaries, just like normal euros are. Thus, the information on individual digital euro payments will be shielded from the ECB, just like normal digital payments are.  A core principle of the digital euro is that the ECB and the payment service providers shall implement technical and organizational measures, including state-of-the-art security and privacy-preserving safeguards, to ensure the identities of digital euro users cannot be accessed by the ECB via its front-end solution.  Actually, tokenized payments even between identified wallets give more options to create privacy protections, not less. The legislation itself requires the ECB to explore pseudonymization or encryption to preserve privacy.  Read more: Dea Markova - Is Europe’s MiCA a Template for Global Crypto Regulation?  Yet, we talk about privacy. We do because it is not the only priority. It competes with the priorities of anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. Digital payments already provide less anonymity and privacy than cash payments. Retail CBDCs are clearly advancing because central banks anticipate the disappearance of cash.  As such, the ECB is looking to replicate some cash-like features, like paying offline or not needing a bank account. But in designing these experiences there will be a choice on what are the limit above which identify verifications are needed. And, to advance anti-money laundering goals, the limits are likely to end up lower than those that we de facto have with cash. If the digital euro gradually replaces cash payments, some of the privacy of cash will be sacrificed.  The ECB is so aware of these citizens’ concerns that in parallel with the digital euro proposal, the Commission launched a proposal to enshrine the right for cash to circulate EU economies. This is an insurance policy against privacy-themed criticism and populism.  We also talk about privacy because the power to abuse privacy in payments needs to be resolutely and purposefully taken away, by law and by design, from both the central bank and the private sector intermediaries – be they banks, payment providers, or Big Tech.  The increased access to data, on individual payments and on an aggregate basis, can empower both central banks and private sector intermediaries to take advantage of it. The latter could choose to price-discriminate against whole classes of citizens, for example, based on their spending patterns.  To avoid this, in my opinion, is critical for the safe future of payments. In Europe, both citizens and institutions agree such safeguards are important.  Ultimately, we talk about privacy because it is an extremely politically-sensitive topic. This legislation will be negotiated in Brussels between now and the next EU elections. To approve the legislation, EU Member States and elected Members of the European Parliament ought to get on board with it and explain to their electorate why. In the lead-up to elections, the political sensitivities of the digital euro will take on a life of their own.  Thus privacy becomes a conduit for the difficult politics of a retail CBDC in well-banked markets. It is a convenient vector of attack regardless of why part of the industry or a decision maker may have reservations about the CBDC.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Dea Markova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/05/the-digital-euro-and-the-p-word,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9dc27f420c6c3044a073133e6c4a0b240172cb4-5200x3467.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The native token of the protocol witnessed a 43% rise on Tuesday, and reached a high of $0.58 on Wednesday, according to data from TradingView. The market capitalization of the token reached a high of $223 million on Wednesday from $143 million on Monday.  The token has since retreated slightly to around $0.42 at the time publication. Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has been trading flat over the past two days and is down slightly on Wednesday.  There appears to be little evidence over what is exactly driving the rally but the uptick comes as South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, witnessed a significant increase in trading volumes for the token. The exchange contributed 57% of STORJ’s spot trading volume, according to Colin Wu, at news outlet WuBlockchain.  Storj was created in 2014, and was built to take underutilized capacity on computers and let users rent it out to then be compensated in tokens. Storj is one of a few competing crypto-backed cloud storage platforms and is often described as an alternative to cloud storage platforms like those offered by Amazon or Google.  Ben Golub, CEO at Storj, told CoinDesk in May that 75% of its users have nothing to do with crypto. Their users range from university’s storing scientific work, AI work to people who need to store video.  “The University of Edinburgh is a big customer of ours, they store a lot of their physics research with us,” said Golub in May.

FOMC Minutes  Coming on Wednesday at 2 p.m. (ET) will be the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's mid-June meeting of its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The Fed at that meeting paused its more than year-long series of rate hikes that had taken its benchmark fed funds rate to 5%-5.25% from 0% in early 2022.  In public comments since that meeting, Fed officials – including Chairman Jay Powell – have made clear that the pause in rate hikes was indeed only a pause. Policymakers at the central bank currently expect to increase rates at least twice more in 2023. Rate traders are in agreement, with the CME's Fed Watch tool currently forecasting an 89% chance the Fed at its next meeting in late July resuming rate hikes with a 25 basis point (bps) boost to the fed funds rate.  Jobs Reports  Market participants will get a preview of what June's employment situation looked like on Thursday at 8:15 a.m. (ET) from the ADP Employment Report. Forecasts are for a sizable slowdown in private sector hiring to 160,000 jobs in June from 278,000 in May.  Coming just a few minutes later on Thursday will be the government's initial jobless claims figure. While this gauge has crept higher in recent months, it continues to remain below levels that would be associated with overall job losses in the economy. Economists are forecasting Thursday's report to show initial jobless claims at 245,000 versus 239,000 previously.  Ninety minutes later on Thursday is the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs), a previously not widely-followed report that's taken on larger importance lately as market participants attempted to leave no stone uncovered in search of signals on the employment outlook. This number has edged lower over the past year, signaling the most modest of softening in the labor market. Forecasters are expecting Thursday's print to show JOLTs at 9.9 million, down from 10.1 million previously.  This week's main event comes Friday morning at 8:30 am ET, with the U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls report for June. This gauge has topped expectations for an astounding 14 consecutive months, continuing to show strength in the face of surging interest rates that many had expected by now would have slowed the economy and put a larger dent in hiring. Economist forecasts are for 250,000 jobs to have been added in June, down from 339,000 in May. The unemployment rate is anticipated to remain at 3.7%.  While many were relaxing ahead of July 4, an important economic gauge was released on Monday with the ISM's Manufacturing Purchasing Mangers Index (PMI). This slowed to 46.0 in June from 46.9 previously and was the weakest level since May 2022, when many Covid lockdowns were still underway.

In case you have missed it, the partnership aims at bridging the worlds of sport and crypto against the backdrop of the American football boom in Europe. Choise.com will support the Vikings throughout their second season in the ELF, inspired by the team’s huge potential and gritty determination to augment their collection of trophies. The Viennese club has already added the Choise.com branding to its game helmets and social media content, while also providing the company with exposure in Hohe Warte Stadium. The next step in this evolving relationship will be the launch of a special fan-style collection of Crypterium VISA cards honoring the Vienna Vikings’ players and team officials. We sat down with the Choise.com CEO Vladimir Gorbunov to discover even more exciting details about the company’s sensational initiative to support the favorites of Europe's most spectacular American football league. Seems like the convergence of sports and crypto is a trend that’s showing no sign of stopping. What made Choise.com ride this wave? The phenomenon of the crypto brands scooping up big sports partnerships comes as no surprise; sport, just like cryptocurrency itself, has no boundaries or limits. Effectively, it boasts an extraordinary power to bring together people from all over the world, which can benefit crypto companies in terms of their coverage. By collaborating with the top sports rights holders, crypto advertisers reach out to a multi-million audience of fans who can further become their potential customers and loyal supporters. The overriding objective of creating such an alliance is to help as many people as possible to understand crypto banking through the use of products with seamless experience. This is exactly what we took into account when joining forces with the Vienna Vikings. By jumping into the sports sponsorship race, Choise.com got an excellent opportunity to make the crypto lifestyle accessible to all. How will collaboration with the Vienna Vikings help Choise.com stand out from the competition? To start with, Choise.com takes precedence as the first crypto firm to team up with the American football club from Europe. Prior to that, we saw a tide of blockchain sponsorships reinforcing teams from the National Football League which is the premier tournament in the USA and Canada. The emergence of the ELF marked a crucial milestone in the history of American football in Europe and the sport itself deservedly gained popularity across the region. In Germany alone, American football experienced a real fan boom, becoming the number two sport behind only football. The Vienna Vikings are the ELF’s defending champions. On the road the 2023 season, they are undefeated, which, we believe, is just the beginning of their grand journey to clinching the title once again. The Vikings’ accomplishments assure a strong presence for Choise.com, allowing us to make the most out of the team’s growing influence in Europe and effectively communicate our mission and values. What’s also important is that this partnership takes place following the “crypto winter” which made many sports rights holders abandon crypto sponsorships. After all the 2022 collapses, they feel like crypto firms can be unstable partners posing particular financial and reputational risks to the whole industry. In this context, the Vienna Vikings’ trust in Choise.com and our products serves as a sign of credibility that the whole crypto industry acutely needs. As a result of your joint efforts, Choise.com will give a unique appearance to one of its distinct products – Crypterium VISA card. Do you plan to expand your partnership with the Vikings into other sectors of your business? All this is yet to be discussed with our colleagues from the Vienna Vikings. On the Choise.com side, we see enormous potential for our cooperation in many spheres. The NFT market is a fairly promising direction to consider, given that non-fungible tokens are the most common point of contract between crypto and sports. Not to mention that we have already built up high-flying experience in creating digital collectibles – our latest Chobies NTO Collection was a resounding success, with total sales exceeding $1.9 million. Are you a fan of American football yourself? Yes, I absolutely love it! That’s why I’m even more happier to see our partnership with the Vikings gaining momentum. Doing an honorary toss before the Vikings’ inaugural game in the 2023 ELF season was a very special moment for me and my son. The overwhelming feeling of unity with the team that I saw and experienced that day, I will never forget. American football is quite a tough sport bringing a lot of emotions and impressions to its lovers. At the same time, all fans and players seem pretty respectful to each other. For example, it’s quite a common case to savor applause to those who were injured, even if they are members of the opposing team. There are some other subtleties which make American football an extremely appealing experience. We at Choise.com hope it will continue to make a whole lot of noise across the global sport industry, winning the hearts of new fans and onboarding them to a thriving world of crypto assets.

42419997,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUIzIz,1688574383,"Elon, You Don’t Need Crypto to Do Twitter Payments","You've heard the script before. Migrants need to make payments back home to their family, but cross-border payments are achingly slow, taking days to process. Luckily, revolutionary new technologies like blockchains, stablecoins, and central bank digital currency (CBDC) are on the verge of speeding things up, or so their advocates claim.  Even Elon Musk has joined in. In an interview last month, Musk says that the banking system is ""still not real-time"" and ""quite inefficient,"" and suggests that his social network, Twitter, may be able to do something about this. His subsidiary, Twitter Payments LLC, just got its first money transmitter license yesterday from the state of New Hampshire, suggesting that he means business.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  Alas, the script is based on dubious assumptions, and money transfer company Wise (previously Transferwise) is a great example of why. Wise, based in London, now processes 55% of its customers' cross-border payments instantly, up from under 10% back in 2018. Wise doesn't rely on blockchains, stablecoins, or CBDC to get up to speed. It uses boring already-existing architecture.  The Wise example suggests that would-be challengers like Elon Musk's Twitter and advocates of blockchains, stablecoins and CBDCs may need to update their views on the incumbent infrastructure they are looking to displace.  Take Elon, for example, who helped found PayPal in 1999 and therefore knows a little bit about the payments system. In his recent interview, he describes the financial system as a heterogenous set of databases that ""slowly engage in batch processing.""  Having subsequently switched his focus from retail payments to rockets and cars in 2000, what Musk seems to have missed is that batch processing of retail payments has been increasingly displaced by real-time processing. Under the older batching systems that prevailed when Elon was still at PayPal, streams of retail payment instructions would be accumulated over the course of the day into a big batch. Come evening-time or the following day that entire mass of payments was cleared and settled. Only then would the money be made available to the recipient.  Batching was efficient, but slug-like.  But then the global payments landscape entered into an era of transformation. Central banks began to build a new generation of payments infrastructure: real-time retail payments systems.  Real-time payments  These new retail payments systems process incoming retail payments on a first-come first-serve basis, and do so instantly. The central banks that offer these systems keep them open through the night and during weekends. Banks and fintechs can in turn plug into these new pieces of public infrastructure in order to offer their customers 24/7 instant payments.  Read more: Elon Musk's Twitter, Crypto's Town Square, Has Found a New CEO  The world's first real-time retail system, Zengin, was built in 1973 by the Bank of Japan, but the movement really only hit its stride in the 2000s as Korea, Mexico, and the UK sped up their capabilities. India and China went real-time in the early 2010s. The U.S. finally got its first instant retail payments system in 2017, with the debut of the Real-Time Payments network, run by privately-owned The Clearing House. It will get its second such system this summer as the Fed introduces its FedNow payments network.  According to a 2021 BIS report, over 60 jurisdictions currently now have real-time retail systems in place running alongside their older batch retail systems. This is up from almost none back when Elon was working in the payments sector.  This new generation of real-time retail payments systems is a big part of why Wise can move 55% of its customers cross-border payments instantly. Here's how it works.  Say a Wise customer in Ireland wants to send 500 euros to a family member in India. First, the money must be moved from the customer's Irish bank account to Wise's account at another Irish bank. In the old days of batch processing, this leg of the remittance would have taken a day or two. Thanks to the European Central Bank's TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS) system, introduced in 2018, a flow like this can now occur in just a few moments.  Having received its customer’s 500 euros, Wise can now proceed to the next stage: paying out 44,000 rupees to the recipient in India. To do so it will have to transfer funds from its account at an Indian bank to the recipient's bank. In the days of batch processing, that meant adding another day or two of waiting. Nowadays, courtesy of India's Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), when Wise sends 44,000 rupees to the family member's bank account the payment can be processed in a second or two.  In sum, the Irish and Indian legs of a modern remittance can be processed in a few heart beats, much faster than the multiple day lags that dominated 20 years ago.  As more and more countries install real-time payments systems, and as Wise integrates itself with them, the proportion of Wise remittances settled in real-time will move ever closer to 100%.  But blockchain?  None of this is to say that there is no space in the cross-border payments landscape for a Twitter-based payments option, stablecoins, or blockchains. There is! It simply means that the incoming competitors need to update their oppo research. Traditional finance isn't the oaf that it is so often made out to be. It already has the technological capability for doing instant cross-border payments, which means the rebels will have to find other factors to differentiate themselves by.  Nor is this spreading bedrock of real-time infrastructure that I’ve just described at all incompatible with the new entrants. If Elon wants to build an instant Twitter payments network, he'll find the web of central bank real-time systems that have blossomed during his 20-year interlude outside the payments space to be a very useful set of rails on which to build.  As for stablecoins and blockchain-based offerings, they too may find it useful to be integrated into 24/7 central bank instant payments systems. For instance, if a DeFi speculator wants to move $10,000 from their bank into a stablecoin at 11PM on Saturday evening in order to take advantage of a fleeting DeFi arbitrage opportunity, and then move the funds back into their bank account by 11:01 PM, central bank instant payments systems can make this possible.  Let a thousand instant payments options bloom, built on top of central bank instant rails.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | RESEARCH,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/05/elon-you-dont-need-crypto-to-do-twitter-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/488b789a9bea677f0a3b5a88d064872bb9f857ae-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It is currently trading at $18.73 today with slight gains on its price. Although SOL is still 92.61% below its all-time high value of $260, its recent gains in the past week have pushed its price closer to the $20 price level. SOL Price Outlook This Week Suggests A Bearish Trend SOL is in a sideways trend this week, following positive price action in the last two weeks. It has formed a small red candle on the weekly chart implying that the bears are active this week. Also, SOL is still trading in the lower region of the Donchian Channel (DC), expressing a bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Humpback Wallets Reach ATH, Is BlackRock Behind The Surge? Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 45.60 in the neutral zone between the oversold region of 30 and the overbought region of 70. The RSI indicator reflects the sideways trend this week. SOL’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is slightly above its signal line and shows convergence which is a bearish signal. Although the MACD displays a negative value, the Histogram bars are green, signaling a bullish recovery ahead. So if the bulls prevail, SOL will likely move to an uptrend in the coming weeks. SOL’s Key Support And Resistance Levels SOL is trading at $18.73 after it found critical support at the $15.43 price level weeks ago. This puts the altcoin close to the $19.48 resistance level. A break above the $19.48 resistance level will help to boost its price to reclaim the $20 psychological resistance level. If this happens, SOL will likely rally to the $21.81 resistance level after breaking above $20. However, a price decline below $18 in the short term remains possible due to its bearish outlook on the weekly chart. Factors Influencing Solana’s Price There are several factors right now that could influence the SOL’s price. These factors include macroeconomic factors such as inflation and crypto regulation in several areas. Also, utility and adoption are vital factors alongside recent trends and developments in the ecosystem. Another trend in SOL’s ecosystem likely influencing its price action this week is its decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. According to a report from the on-chain analytic platform DefiLlama, Solana’s weekly DEX volume increased to see it rank fifth on the list at press time. Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Sustains Weekly Run With 16% Gain – What Fuels It? SOL’s DEX volume surged by 84%, and its 24-hour volume rose above $38 million. This increase will likely help to boost its price action in the coming week. However, despite an increase in its total DEX volume, its Total Value Locked (TVL) is stagnant. DefiLlama shows that SOL’s TVL has been stagnant since its decline in November 2022 following the collapse of FTX. The TVL is currently sitting at $273.26 million, with no notable increase in value despite slight gains in SOL’s price on the daily chart.

42420017,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUIzaX,1688572800,A New Metric to Evaluate Crypto Ecosystem Fundamentals,"When evaluating layer-1 (L1) blockchains, many fundamental investors focus on metrics such as price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratios. While these metrics are important, they ignore the programmable aspect of a blockchain’s token supply. Because a blockchain’s emissions schedule (i.e., when new tokens will enter circulation due to staking rewards and token unlocks) is known, its cost structure into the future is essentially known as well.  The years-to-profitability (YTP) ratio is a useful new metric for analyzing an L1’s profitability as it incorporates the blockchain’s forward supply curve. It applies the traditional finance (TradFi) concepts of breakeven analysis and payback periods to crypto. The analysis views an L1 blockchain through the lens of a business that sells secured blockspace. Revenues are the fees that users pay to record transactions on the chain, and expenses are the costs needed to secure the network. YTP calculates a blockchain’s profitability timeline by factoring in the protocol’s current revenue and cost structure, a projected growth rate (CAGR) and future supply dynamics.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  We find YTP compelling because it provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating an individual blockchain or comparing multiple blockchains.  We start our calculation with Token Terminal’s definition of L1 profitability:  It is important to note that all revenues and costs are denominated in the L1’s native token. And, while unlocks and staking rewards both increase the number of tokens in circulation, the difference between transaction fees and the portion of those fees paid to proof-of-stake validators is what is used to burn or reduce the number of tokens in circulation. In this sense, YTP measures the point at which an L1’s circulating supply stabilizes at 0% inflation. Some broad assumptions we make are:  The percentage of the transaction fee burned remains constant.  The foundation takes 10 years to sell all its tokens.  For revenues, we use the L1’s revenue for the last quarter annualized.  In comparing YTP across blockchains, it’s helpful to group the L1s by whether they have an inflationary tokenomic model or a max supply model, because with the latter, an L1 might “break even” simply because the chain’s fixed supply was reached (as modeled for SUI or ADA). Here’s an analysis for multiple blockchains, with Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain excluded because they are already profitable:  Then, by using the same set of growth rate assumptions for each chain (we calculated future CAGRs of 30%, 40% and 50%), we can make comparisons across chains and explore more deeply what drives YTP. For example, while APT has a high YTP, this is partially because the chain is relatively new and therefore its revenues are smaller than those of other more established chains. SOL has modest inflationary schedules compared to blockchains like NEAR or ICP. In all examples, a blockchain’s ability to burn tokens (and provide some kind of offset to new emissions) is helpful for managing YTP.  In conclusion, YTP serves as a crucial metric in evaluating the profitability and sustainability of L1 blockchains. By carefully designing tokenomics (inflationary or max supply), balancing supply dynamics and incorporating burn mechanics, L1 blockchains can aim to reduce YTP and build a more sustainable blockchain economy.

42419998,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUIzL3,1688572800,Axiom’s Zero-Knowledge Proofs Might One Day Help Detect Deepfakes,"The crypto startup Axiom – a protocol allowing developers to write smart contracts on Ethereum that can retrieve data from the blockchain network and then perform intensive computations on it – has launched its mainnet in alpha mode.  The startup is looking at eventually using the technology to quickly and accurately detect deepfakes on the internet, said founder Yi Sun.  Axiom uses zero-knowledge proofs, a type of cryptographic proof that can prove the validity of a statement with only selectively revealing any information about the statement itself, and one of this year’s hottest trends in blockchain technology. The project uses what it calls a “coprocessor,” a piece of software running in parallel but asynchronously to the Ethereum blockchain.  Once data is read and ingested, the coprocessor can perform “diverse operations” – addition, counting and other mathematical functions, as well as cryptography, according to the company’s website. It’s also capable of machine learning.  Read more: 10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better (or Maybe Worse)  After Ethereum switched to its 2.0 version in an event known as The Merge, smart contracts could no longer access historical on-chain data. Oracles, commonly deployed to bring off-chain data on the blockchain, like Chainlink and Uniswap, are also attempting to solve this problem.  But their offerings are expensive and slow due to computational limitations of the current technology. According to Sun, Axiom's co-founder, traditional oracles make trust assumptions to bring off-chain entities on-chain, which puts a dent in the accuracy of the transmission.  The coprocessor does away with these limitations by processing data off-chain and then transporting them on the main chain accurately with ZK proofs. The possibility of a ZK proof producing an erroneous result is 1/(2^256) – small enough to essentially be non-existent, said Sun.  With the mainnet alpha release, developers can query block headers, accounts and contract storage on Ethereum mainnet via the Axiom explorer application. They can also use the explorer to build their own applications. The data processing currently occurs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and the startup is “working with early partners to perform trustless compute over this data in ZK,” says Axiom’s website.  Axiom will enable the development of truly “data rich” applications on Ethereum, says the site. For example, “by allowing airdrops to depend on arbitrary historic on-chain data, Axiom allows protocols to customize criteria to reward actions beneficial to the protocol, not airdrop farmers,” the website says.  The ZKML future  In Axiom’s vision, ZK proofs go hand in hand with the booming AI sector.  “I think what is really interesting is that generative artificial intelligence and deepfakes are bringing demand for crypto,” said Sun. Authenticating the veracity of information and media is becoming a bigger problem in an internet flooded by AI-generated content.  In Axiom’s vision, ZK proofs will be used for such authentication processes. Machine learning algorithms, some of which train themselves to generate images or text based on prompts, will be able to run off-chain, but when ZK proofs bring their results on-chain, users and smart contracts will be able to check where and how a piece of online content was generated.  The startup was launched in 2022 by Sun, who teaches at the University of Chicago, and MIT researcher Jonathan Wang.

The upgrade aims to increase the number of transactions per second (TPS) its blockchain can handle, and reduce the time-to-inclusion – the length of time needed to confirm and report a transaction.  Quantum Leap went live on the testnet on Wednesday. If the Starknet community approves of the code change in a governance vote, the upgrade will be deployed to Starknet’s mainnet around July 13, according to a press release from StarkWare, the company behind Starknet.  Although it's unclear how many transactions per second Starknet will process after the upgrade is live, StarkWare claims that the blockchain will be able to handle at least 100 once it’s deployed. The team also says Starknet will become a more competitive alternative to build applications on as congestion is reduced.  Quantum Leap is “all about empowering developers and letting them unleash their creativity without the bounds of computation that they're so accustomed to from other blockchains,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, the co-founder of StarkWare, in an interview with CoinDesk.  The ramp-up is part of Starknet’s roadmap, which includes a series of upgrades aimed at making it more scalable. According to the Starknet roadmap website, the blockchain has other scheduled upgrades planned for third and fourth quarters of 2023, aimed at reducing transaction fees and shortening block intervals.  In addition, Quantum Leap comes as the blockchain prepares to deploy storage proofs to its mainnet, which is a cryptographic feature aimed at alleviating cross-chain bridge hacks.

42420018,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUIzYT,1688572800,"Bitcoin Prices Are Hot, but Here’s What Could Crush the Rally","We’re starting today’s column where we left the last, asking: Will macroeconomic narratives subside? The answer may ultimately be a bit nuanced. Macro factors will always play a role, but some key issues have been occurring in a relatively predictable fashion, especially as they relate to inflation.  Save for a few hiccups, inflation projections and the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) expected response with interest rates have played out as expected.  Bitcoin (BTC) prices are up 87% year to date and seem to have found support near $30,000. Ether (ETH) has risen 64%, trailing BTC but still impressive nonetheless.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Both have largely shrugged off this perilous period for the overall crypto industry. Something called the Anchored Volume Weighted Average Price (AVWAP) of BTC helps show that.  Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is a technical indicator that lets traders determine the average price of an asset, taking volume and price into account. AVWAP does the same thing but lets traders anchor their starting point to a customized date.  Bitcoin’s AVWAP since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase is 9.1% lower than where BTC currently trades. The AVWAP taken from Nov. 9, 2022, the day Binance scrapped its proposed FTX takeover, is $22,632. Anchoring from when Celsius paused withdrawals in June 2022 shows an AVWAP of $21,400.  In other words, bitcoin has bounced back from a series of bad events.  The latest industry catalyst appears to be BlackRock’s recent filing for a spot bitcoin ETF.  The question now is, what could go wrong? What macroeconomic developments could send prices lower, eroding the aforementioned gains?  Reading through some of the more recent speeches by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicates that the FOMC is resigned to continuing its current course of action.  The market appears to be expecting at least two more rate hikes in 2023, topping out around 5.6%. If that occurs, it's difficult to imagine a significant shock to prices in either direction; it’s likely already priced in.  But there are a few other macro factors that warrant attention in crypto markets:  Banks passed the most recent stress tests  One of the largest news stories of the year was the collapse of Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley Bank. Since both had ties to crypto, the news reverberated throughout the sector. Their failure led to thoughts that FOMC rate hikes had gone too far, creating too much stress among banks.  However, recent stress tests that were administered to 23 systemically important banks showed they appear to be well-positioned to weather a severe recession and continue lending to qualified households. The test assumed an unemployment rate of 10%, a 40% decline in commercial real estate and a 38% decline in housing prices.  The FOMC may feel that it has enough room to aggressively raise rates, despite the impact that may be felt. Subsequent weakness in the economy would be painful but would likely bring inflation down without cratering the banking system.  Consumer revolving debt continues to rise  Revolving debt is at all-time highs. This is an area that doesn’t get a ton of attention, but is still significant.  Crypto investing continues to have a large retail component. Glassnode data show 1.3 million BTC held by investors with less than 1 bitcoin, and that population has grown 73% since 2021.  Increases in credit balances in conjunction with higher interest rates and potentially lower employment concern me as far as crypto investing is concerned.  That pesky yield curve is still inverted  The spread between 2- and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields is deeply inverted, with its -1.08% spread the largest since 1981.  Historically, inversions are often followed by recessions. However, the FOMC’s most recent summary of economic projections does not appear to be forecasting a recession.  Still, this disconnect between economic history and economic forecast implies a degree of uncertainty that may not be priced in by markets.  As an investor with a bullish bias, it forces me to ask, “What if I’m wrong?” I don’t think I'm alone. As more investors ask this question, a reluctance could grow when it comes to deploying capital to crypto assets.  That, in and of itself, could serve as a short-term hurdle for crypto prices.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here is some news worth reading:  BLOCK SCHOLES: It doesn’t take too long hanging around finance before you hear the words “Black-Scholes,” the famous options pricing model. I’ve even seen it argued that it’s one of the most important math formulas of the past century. Anyway, when you spot a headline with “Block Scholes,” you start wondering if that’s a typo of Black-Scholes. But, no, it’s a crypto data firm, and a recent CoinDesk story explains that it has determined that crypto prices have untethered from stocks. I’d argue this is either really good news for macro investors looking for uncorrelated assets or terrible news for crypto traders adrift in a sea of bad news.

14544616,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/polygon-signs-second-big-partnership-with-indian-government,1688572599,Polygon signs second big partnership with Indian government,"Polygon has formed its second significant partnership with the Indian government. A 3-way partnership The Indian government has partnered with Polygon and Airchains in order to develop a blockchain-based land ownership system. Under this agreement Polygon will closely collaborate with government bodies and stakeholders to explore and implement blockchain solutions across various sectors. The primary goal of this partnership is to utilise Polygons' expertise in scalable blockchain infrastructure to enhance existing government initiatives and streamline operations. By integrating blockchain technology into critical systems. Airchain, a prominent player in the logistics industry, will also play a vital role in the partnership between Polygon and the Indian government. With its expertise in supply chain management and logistics solutions, Airchain will collaborate with Polygon to streamline and optimise the movement of goods within the blockchain-powered ecosystem. Two areas where blockchain provides the solution Land document mutation is a real issue in India and can often lead to landowners unlawfully losing possession of their land. The implementation of a system based on the transparency of blockchain will aim to bring trust back into land ownership transactions. An additional and exciting new development that can become a reality through blockchain is that of fractional property ownership. Once properly implemented, the door will be open for many citizens to be able to own a fractional share of land, something that was unthinkable not so long ago. A Digital India This collaboration aligns with the Indian government's vision of a Digital India by accelerating the country's journey towards digital transformation. Polygons' established reputation, technical proficiency, and commitment to scalability make it an ideal partner. As demand for blockchain based solutions continues to rise, Polygon's infrastructure and expertise can play a crucial role in realising India's digital aspirations. This collaboration has the potential not only to unlock new possibilities but also drive innovation while establishing India as a global leader in blockchain technology. By actively pursuing partnerships with prominent projects like Polygon the Indian government demonstrates its proactive approach towards embracing cutting edge technologies. Such collaborations foster cooperation, knowledge sharing, and innovation—an ecosystem that can keep India at the forefront of digital progress. In its endeavour to further engage with the Indian government, Polygon aims to create ripple effects that surpass national boundaries. This distinctive partnership paves the way for other governments globally, exhibiting how blockchain technology can bring about transformative changes in addressing tangible obstacles and stimulating socioeconomic advancement.

42419995,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUIzHx,1688571212,"Chainlink ‘Proof of Reserve’ Proves Little Beyond Data Going In, Coming Out","Crypto infrastructure firm Chainlink claims its proof-of-reserves service – designed to help users verify that exchanges and asset managers have the backing they profess – “enables the reliable and timely monitoring of reserve assets using #ProofNotPromises.”  In reality, the system frequently relies on promises all the way down.  Chainlink Proof of Reserve is one of the only ways for crypto custodians to track real-world assets directly on blockchains, a service that unlocks a host of safety and transparency benefits for the end-users of decentralized finance (DeFi) products.  However, rather than help crypto users transact with more confidence and transparency, Chainlink’s reserve tech can also provide them with a false sense of security – adding a veneer of legitimacy and “decentralization” to the same inadequate accounting practices that were exposed by the collapse of the FTX exchange.  When it comes to integrating centralized data into decentralized protocols, a deep dive into Chainlink’s proof-of-reserves tech shows how “promises,” not “proof,” are often the best that one can realistically hope for.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  What is Chainlink Proof of Reserve?  Chainlink is the leading provider of crypto “oracles” – software modules that gather off-chain data – prices, weather info, whatever – and then feed that into blockchain-based applications. Chainlink’s main draw is that it can source information from a wide network of node operators, reducing the need for platforms to place their trust in centralized data sources.  Over the past couple of years, Chainlink has expanded its product suite to include proof-of-reserves accounting – a way for crypto custodians to prove that they hold as many assets as they claim to customers.  Proof-of-reserves has become a hot topic since last year’s crypto-market meltdown, which prompted questions over how investors might be able to verify if their exchanges can actually prove they are safely keeping customers’ assets, and where.  After the FTX exchange crashed and was accused of misappropriating user funds, leading exchanges like Binance, and stablecoin operators like Circle – companies that custody user funds or issue tokens representing assets in real-world banks – rushed to assure users that their reserve claims can be trusted.  Even as companies began publishing official proof-of-reserves reports, users demanded more than just third-party audits and attestations – like the ones FTX received – to back up their numbers.  Chainlink offered these companies an alternative – a way to transparently monitor and report their reserves in a manner that leveraged the “autonomous,” and “decentralized” properties provided by blockchains.  Looking under the hood, however, Chainlink’s tech may add more confusion than transparency in some cases. Its decentralized oracle network helps ensure the safe delivery of off-chain reserve data, but it doesn’t make that data any more credible than it would be otherwise.  Paxos and Self-Attestations  Chainlink explains its reserve-proving tech on its website: “Operated by a decentralized network of oracles, Chainlink Proof of Reserve enables the autonomous auditing of collateral in real-time, helping ensure user funds are protected from unforeseen fractional reserve practices and other fraudulent activity from off-chain custodians.”  As for what this unlocks, according to Chainlink, “rather than forcing users to trust paper guarantees made by custodians, Chainlink PoR can be deployed for automated on-chain audits that give users a superior guarantee of an asset’s underlying collateralization.”  Paxos, the stablecoin operator, uses Chainlink PoR for PAXG, its gold-backed stablecoin, and USDP, its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin.  On Twitter, Chainlink boasted that its partnership with Paxos would allow app developers “easily audit the off-chain gold reserves backing PAX Gold.” Paxos, in a press release, said the Chainlink oracles would enable people to “quickly verify on-chain that PAX tokens are fully backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars and PAXG tokens are fully backed by gold bars, both of which are held off-chain in Paxos’ custody.”  The terms “audit” and “verify” may be a stretch in this case, however.  Of the 16 third-party node operators that report on PAXG’s gold reserves, every single one of them gets its data from the same place: Paxos itself. It’s the same case for USDP: Chainlink’s “decentralized” network of 16 node operators each reports that the stablecoin is backed by $1.04 billion – the number handed to them by a Paxos API, meaning it’s a data feed that comes directly from the project.  Chainlink calls this reporting practice “self-attestation,” and it warns in its developer docs that “self-attested feeds carry additional risk.”  In a statement shared with CoinDesk, Chainlink said “Only a small minority of Chainlink PoR users are still self-attested,” adding that “Some users start here as a first step towards greater transparency.” Chainlink did not provide any examples of projects that have moved from self-attestations to other reserve-reporting methods.  Whatever the precise details on how Paxos calculates its reserve numbers (Paxos did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s questions on the matter), the data that the company reports to Chainlink ultimately requires total trust in Paxos – not Chainlink’s third-party oracle network.  There are reasons why consumers might trust Paxos. For one thing, the stablecoin issuer uses a third-party accounting firm to conduct monthly attestations of its PAXG and USDP reserves, though the data that Paxos reports to Chainlink is updated more frequently than that – at least once per day.  Paxos is also a New York State-chartered trust company, meaning it is much more tightly regulated than most other stablecoin operators. However, Paxos was recently forced to stop minting Binance-linked BUSD stablecoins after New York State regulators charged the firm with violating “its obligation to conduct tailored, periodic risk assessments and due diligence refreshes.”  Paxos uses its Chainlink PoR feeds as a way to earn credibility with distrustful DeFi traders, but its “fully-backed” claims don’t become more credible just because they pass through Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.  Using an extreme analogy – a stablecoin issuer “self-attesting” to its reserves via Chainlink would be like FTX emailing its financials to 16 people and asking them to disseminate the numbers on its behalf. Even if numbers are “audited” (as they often were, in the case of FTX), they would ultimately only be as trustworthy as that original email from FTX.  TrueUSD and Third-Party Attestations  Different companies use the “proof-of-reserves” moniker to describe different accounting systems, each of varying quality. Accordingly, Chainlink’s PoR partners all use their own methods to back up their reserve claims.  “Chainlink will do all kinds of different stuff and just call it ‘proof-of-reserve,’” explained Niklas Kunkel, formerly head of Oracles at MakerDAO. One decentralized app’s proof-of-reserves program “doesn't have the same trust or security guarantees as proof of reserve on another app.”  Archblock (previoustly TrustToken), the company behind the U.S. dollar-backed TrueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin, uses Chainlink to prove that each of its TUSD tokens is backed by a dollar in reserves. Instead of self-attesting to its reserves, it reports them to Chainlink’s oracles via The Network Firm, a third-party accountant.  In a blog post explaining its Chainlink partnership, Archblock explained that The Network Firm “aggregates all reserves data (U.S. dollars held at financial institutions) in real-time and serves that information on-chain through Chainlink’s industry-leading decentralized oracle network.”  The Network Firm boasts a robust, industry-first, real-time asset-tracking system. It says it sources reserve data directly from custodians and uses a cryptographic method called Merkle Trees to verify amounts.  However, Chainlink’s oracles aren’t doing any of this cryptography or accounting themselves. Instead, they’re linked up to The Network Firm’s in-house API, a computer system that reports the data to them.  Trusting TUSD’s Chainlink PoR feed means trusting The Network Firm’s attestations.  Troubles with TrueUSD  The Network Firm’s founders used to lead the crypto arm of Armanino – the U.S. accounting firm that shuttered its crypto division after facing ridicule for failing to find discrepancies with FTX’s U.S. division, which it was hired to audit.  Armanino has since defended its work for the collapsed exchange giant, but The Network Firm’s link with FTX’s auditor garnered renewed scrutiny last week when questions surfaced around TUSD’s reserve reports.  Archblock previously used Prime Trust, a large crypto custodian, to hold a portion of TUSD’s reserves and handle stablecoin-to-dollar redemptions. In late June, Nevada regulators ordered the custodian to shut down and accused it of losing $80 million worth of client funds.  Archblock initially stated it had “no exposure” to the Prime Trust debacle but eventually disclosed that it held a relatively small sum ($26,000) with the firm.  Archblock’s about-face came alongside rumors that some people were having issues redeeming TUSD tokens. At one point, the price of TUSD on Binance briefly dropped to 80 cents. All the events sparked (or were spurred on by) concerns with TUSD’s solvency.  It was a Network Firm disclosure that ultimately gets credit for flagging the ongoing relationship between TUSD and Prime Trust, but the incident underscored the limited transparency provided by The Network Firm’s reserve-reporting apparatus.  TrueUSD’s ownership and banking relationships have long been difficult for the public to discern, and The Network Firm does not name the banks that TUSD does business with in its attestations. (It referred to Prime Trust as “a U.S. depository institution which has communicated to customers that the institution has been ordered by state regulators to halt deposits and withdrawals for fiat and digital asset accounts.”) Reserve snapshots like those provided by The Network Firm (and most other attestation providers) also frequently lack a full picture of a company's total liabilities; even if money is in a bank account, that doesn’t mean it isn’t owed to someone else.  The numbers reported to Chainlink’s oracles, in other words, can’t possibly tell the full story.  Asked for clarity as to how it specifically tracks TUSD assets, The Network Firm said it was “limited in making public statements about specific clients for whom we are engaged to provide attest services.”  Regular attestations are better than no attestations at all, but with limited transparency come additional questions. For instance, what good is “proof” that reserves exist if a portion of them – however minuscule – are locked up with a collapsed financial institution?  TUSD has a “ripcord” system that works in conjunction with Chainlink’s PoR feeds to auto-pause minting and redemptions in the event of reserve discrepancies. A ripcord was briefly pulled around the time of The Network Firm’s Prime Trust disclosure, but according to a tweet from TrueUSD, this was only “due to a delay in one of the new banking partner's API interface, which prevented the auditor(TNF) from reading the bank's latest escrow balance.” The relationship between TUSD and a suspicious “U.S. depository institution” didn’t trigger the ripcord itself.  Chainlink Proof of Reserve in context  Chainlink is far from the only company with problem-laden proof-of-reserve promises; the issues with the firm’s PoR tech ultimately stem from limitations with reserve accounting in general.  The key thing is that Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network only serves to ensure that data from centralized entities is not tampered with before it makes it on-chain. It doesn’t make that original data any more (or less) credible.  Chainlink doesn’t hide these caveats. At the bottom of its proof-of-reserve dashboard, the oracle firm cautions that “feeds can vary in their configurations” and warns app-builders that they “are solely responsible for reviewing the quality of the data (e.g., a Proof of Reserve feed) that you integrate into your smart contracts.” While projects like Paxos self-attest to their data, most report their reserve data to Chainlink via auditors or directly from custodians.  But it's unclear how many end-users realize where they are placing their trust when it comes to Chainlink’s PoR oracles. Frequently, projects use the mere existence of the oracles as a way to bolster their credibility with users.  A Messari report commissioned by Chainlink showed that TUSD deposits dramatically increased after TUSD made its Chainlink PoR push. According to the report, “Within one month after Chainlink added TUSD PoR data feeds, the TUSD market cap increased by 121%,” an increase of over $1 billion. It’s difficult to say how much of this spike is attributable to TUSD’s Chainlink oracles, but the PoR feeds figure prominently in TUSD’s recent marketing.  In response to questions from CoinDesk, Chainlink made the case that its PoR technology – while imperfect – was still a step in the right direction for transparency within the broader crypto industry. The firm points out that it “requires the user to have an attestation method that is publicly disclosed by Chainlink” (emphasis Chainlink’s).  Also, even if reserve claims cannot be backed up with full guarantees, Chainlink notes that it is one of the only solutions for developers to bake them directly into the code of decentralized finance protocols. This can, in theory, unlock a number of safety and transparency benefits for users (e.g. TUSD’s ripcords).  The tech is also powerful for tracking cross-chain reserves – allowing blockchain-based projects on one network to easily prove that they have reserves on another network. Per Chainlink’s statement, “This method fully leverages the immutable and transparent characteristics of blockchains, but is only practical if all assets and related transactions are on-chain.”  In general, though, it’s still unclear whether these efforts at transparency are a step in the right direction, or are merely setting up an illusion of decentralization in a fundamentally trust-based system.",NEGATIVE,TUSD,EXCHANGE | FIAT | LINK | MARKET | TUSD,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/05/chainlink-proof-of-reserve-proves-little-beyond-data-going-in-coming-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d92ad3343a95cf422517cf0d6973f64f1547c68-1119x630.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The hyper-casual community-based NFT game allows players to compete against friends on the Sweat Wallet mobile app, which uses data from other apps on your smartphone or smartwatch to monitor your physical activity. The game is created based on sustainable token economics, aiming to enhance the overall competition levels and maintain a thriving gaming ecosystem. Sweat Hero introduces a unique approach to how gaming works. In contrast to the “pay-to-play” models adopted by legacy games, Sweat Hero offers new players a free non-fungible token (NFT) to start the game - basically, paying the users to play. Users connect with each other via the Sweat Wallet app and battle against each other to upgrade their NFTs or win $SWEAT token rewards. Offering a free-to-play model also contrasts with most of the move-to-earn games today. Sweat Hero revolutionizes this industry by creating a sustainable tokenomics (token economics) model that doesn’t involve asking players to purchase NFTs worth hundreds of dollars before playing. Many of these NFT games and M2E platforms sustain their economy by expecting new users to join and purchase an NFT. Additionally, the teams may limit the number of NFTs to induce artificial scarcity and potentially increase their value, preventing some players from ever getting their hands on them. On the contrary, Sweat Hero launches a “token sink model” that solves these problems and increases the economic viability of the game’s ecosystem. The token sink system works by retaining 20% of the total battle wager as a battle fee, with 80% of the wager going to the winner. The battle fee is sent to Sweat Wallet’s token sink and burned to reduce the total number of circulating $SWEAT tokens. As more people join the battle, more tokens will be burned, meaning there will be fewer idle and liquid tokens in the ecosystem. ""We're leaving behind the times of scarcity in the NFT space and breaking the old standard of 'pay to play' in the M2E gaming space,” Oleg Fomenko, Co-founder of Sweat Economy, shared. “With Sweat Hero, millions of people can engage with free NFTs, and the more players we have, the more $SWEAT goes into the token sink, making token economics sustainable."" As players win battles and challenges by increasing their daily steps, they will enhance their NFT Power, giving them an in-game advantage. These NFTs are dynamic and will evolve based on users' gameplay progression, physical activities, and engagement within the Sweat Wallet app. Apart from rewards and earnings in the game, the gamification of physical activity on Sweat Hero makes exercising more fun and motivates users to follow their daily exercise routines. These factors can have an overarching effect on the overall health of the users by motivating users to walk more, creating a daily habit and driving engagement through battles with friends. The future upgrades on Sweat Wallet will introduce seven Arenas that players can level up into to secure a higher earning potential and a new dynamic NFT evolvement framework expected to launch in Q4 this year.

Crypto analyst and influencer 24HRSCRYPTO is one of those who have put forward an extremely optimistic outlook for the XRP cryptocurrency. The analyst says that the altcoin, which is currently trading below $1, will reach as high as $100, and has provided reasons. XRP’s Daily Burn Rate Surges, Fueling Speculation of $100 Token Value 24HRSCRYPTO unveiled an astonishing increase in XRP’s burn rate through a series of tweets that captivated the attention of the XRP community. Related Reading: Bitcoin Humpback Wallets Reach ATH, Is BlackRock Behind The Surge? The surge in XRP’s daily burn rate has been a topic of great interest within the crypto community.

That number… https://t.co/OipXjajMnx — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) July 4, 2023 With the total supply of XRP decreasing by 247,016 over the course of just 30 days, equivalent to an average of approximately 8,233 XRP burned per day, the stage is set for a potential upward trend that could lead to a significant appreciation in XRP’s value. In comparison to the figures observed in previous months, the recent 247,016 burned XRP represents a significant increase. This development has prompted crypto enthusiasts to question the potential for further growth and whether it could drive XRP’s value to unprecedented heights. The increased burn rate and the subsequent reduction in XRP’s supply have sparked a wave of excitement among investors. It suggests the possibility of a bullish trend, with the burn rate potentially rising even further as trillions of dollars flow into the crypto market. XRP price trending above $0.47 | Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com Senior Ripple Engineer Shares Insight A deeper dive into the factors driving the heightened burn rate reveals valuable insights as a Software engineer at Ripple, Neil Hartner, shed light on the situation, attributing the surge to the deletion of XRPL accounts as a deleted account equals two XRP burned. Hartner specifically highlighted Poloniex, a leading crypto exchange, which recently deleted a staggering 85,566 outdated XRPL accounts. This action alone contributed to the burning of 171,132 XRP. As the burn rate accelerates and the supply of XRP dwindles, the prospect of XRP reaching $100 per token gains traction. While some skeptics may question the validity of such a bold claim, the consistent upward trend in the burn rate provides a compelling argument if it continues at such a scale. Related Reading: Zilliqa (ZIL) Notches 10% In Anticipation Of Network Upgrade The continuous rise in the burn rate and the deletion of XRPL accounts by prominent exchanges reflect the evolving landscape of the crypto market.

Just as crypto itself is constantly evolving, so is its close relative, the world of online crypto gambling! Despite the huge success that many platforms within the market have already experienced, this hybrid industry is still young and growing in prominence, meaning right now is an important time to pay attention to all the progress it's making. A good way to track this is by taking a look at the future long-term plans of some of the best platforms around, such as Scorpion Casino (SCORP), Fun Token (FUN) and Stake.com. Scorpion is especially worth paying attention to at the moment - read more to find out why. Scorpion Aims To Change The Game! Scorpion Casino is currently in the midst of a widely successful presale, which will end with the launch of its native Scorpion Token (SCORP). SCORP will be a deflationary token that improves alongside the platform through automatic burns every single time a user makes a transaction and every single time the casino generates profit. The success of the upcoming token is important due to the position it holds as the asset that empowers the platform’s ecosystem and its total 370 licensed games (210 casino games and 160 live games) as well as all the sports betting opportunities for popular sports such as American Basketball and International Football. The token will join a short but solid list of top cryptos users can bet with, including the biggest crypto of all time, Bitcoin (BTC). Have All The FUN You Want With The Token As suggested by its name, Fun Token is a platform focused on becoming the home of all the fun users can have online when it comes to crypto gaming. The platform prides itself on being a diverse place that offers fairness and transparency to all of its player base, meaning that everyone can bet and play amongst each other using the assets in their wallets without any worries of being taken advantage of or worse. Some of the latest developments being made in the world of Fun token are about accessibility. The project has partnered with Now Payments that has made for users to pay with FUN easier than before and the integration with ChangeNOW DEX, ensures faster and more secure FUN token swaps. Stake.com Builds An Empire Stake.com is an online sportsbook and casino that debuted in 2017 and shot to fame right away. They quickly rose to the position of becoming one of the world's largest online casinos, thanks to its numerous sponsorship agreements. The success of Stake.com is proof that the merger of crypto and betting will become a telling tale in the near future! According to rumours, Rush Street Interactive may be on Stake.com's list of prospective targets as it seeks acquisitions that could provide it access to the US iGaming market. The platform wants to expand into more regulated gambling areas in the US and abroad. Furthermore, Stake is also aiming to obtain a licence in Australia's regulated online gambling industry. It also has an application for iGaming in Ontario, Canada, that it is currently waiting to hear back from. Considering the fact that Stake is based out of Curaçao and already has offices all over the world, global domination is clearly on its agenda! How Scorpion Claws its Way To The Top One of the platform's primary focuses is its community, ensuring that all its users have an enjoyable and lucrative experience on the platform to make sure they keep coming back for more. Users can create a passive income avenue on the platform, potentially earning up to $10,000 per day by betting with SCORP, thanks to its integrated distribution. On top of that, users can earn rewards of $1000 upwards if they take part in other platform features, such as signing up for the VIP Members Club and much more. There’s even more about the platform that could establish it as the go-to place once the presale is over, but for now, when it comes to earning opportunities - it's unmatched!

42420005,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUIzTJ,1688565987,U.K. Blazes Trail With New Cryptocurrency Rules,"Earlier this month, the U.K.'s financial conduct regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, announced new, near-final proposed rules, following recently-enacted secondary legislation, on financial promotion of crypto-assets within the country. Taken together with the passage of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (the “2023 Act”) earlier this week, which brings crypto-assets under the UK’s broader financial regulatory regime contained in the U.K. Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”), including FSMA’s rules on financial promotions, it is now all but inevitable that the FCA’s new rules – or ones very close to them – will be entering into force on schedule on or about October 8.  Preston Byrne is a corporate partner in Brown Rudnick's Digital Commerce group.  This is the culmination of a yearslong effort in the U.K. government to create new rules to govern cryptocurrency business within its borders. As such, it represents something of a departure for the U.K. from its usual approach to crypto asset regulation. Historically, Britain’s financial regulators have not had the power to regulate – and thus have avoided regulating – crypto-assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, or Cosmos in their capacity as investments, at least in the same manner that they regulated TradFi instruments such as securities. This differs significantly from the regulatory landscape in the United States where, infamously, the SEC asserts more or less plenary authority over the cryptocurrency sector by utilizing 90-year-old securities legislation, and in relation to which it has been prosecuting a regulation-by-enforcement campaign in the federal courts.  Among many other things, the 2023 Act folds certain types of regulated activities, like arranging deals in or managing investments when crypto is the underlying product, into the FCA’s regulatory scheme. It also grants additional (and as far as I can tell open-ended) powers under a new “Designated Activities Regime” to impose crypto-specific, as-yet-undetermined rules and restrictions on the industry, which in the government’s opinion include powers to go so far as banning of particular types of crypto business or asset.  The most immediately relevant provisions from the Act for cryptocurrency developers, though, are aforementioned changes which bring cryptocurrency marketing fully under the existing financial promotions regime. Generally speaking, in the U.K., one is not allowed to ""communicate an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity"" in the course of business to a prospective customer unless conducted or approved via a regulated entity, or an exemption applies.  Regulated entities under the new regime for crypto include FCA authorized firms, registered crypto-asset firms, or authorized firms which have passed through regulatory gateway legislation (which is currently with Parliament). How these communications may be made and what they must contain is governed by complex rules, too. Given that penalties for noncompliance include fines and potential imprisonment, strict adherence to the rules is a must.  Current state of play  What does this mean? Unlike in the U.S., and news stories saying “crypto is now a regulated activity,” cryptocurrency itself has not been redesignated as a regulated product. As far as I can tell, the act of hashing a genesis block, mining coins, and distributing them otherwise than in the course of business still isn’t regulated, whereas in America many people think this activity is regulated.  Engaging in certain types of “regulated activities” which are already regulated vis a vis other kinds of investments in relation to crypto, however, will be regulated going forward. For service providers undertaking what would otherwise be regulated activities, it means compliance and licensure.  Developers and issuers, on the other hand, should still consider the U.K. open for business, although they will need to approach doing business in the U.K. and with U.K. consumers with considerably more care than before. Unlike in the U.S. where the regulator is asserting that crypto-assets are securities, cryptoassets qua cryptoassets are more or less treated the same as they were a year ago. Extremely stringent rules around marketing cryptocurrency to consumers are proceeding ahead, and marketing holds the heaviest compliance burden for devs.  The types of marketing covered by the financial promotion regime could include not only marketing in a formal sense like a television advertisement or an investment memorandum, but also less formal communications where cryptocurrency companies usually market their protocols such as podcasts, hackathons, conference events, and meetups, or online banner ads and Tweets. The new regime also includes communications to high-net-worth and sophisticated investors.  Moreover, based on my reading, the new rules make no distinction between ICO-based crypto assets like Polkadot or Cosmos, and cryptocurrencies generally regarded as “decentralized” and not subject to much regulation even in the United States, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. This means that, say, a cryptocurrency ATM might need an FCA-authorized firm to review the marketing copy it displays on its user interface (“Buy crypto here!”).  The bargain that appears to be emerging in the U.K. is that the price of freedom to develop and trade crypto is tight regulation on how it is marketed to consumers. If things get too out of hand, more rules may follow. But they haven’t followed yet. This is a novel approach which, unlike the draconian regulatory crackdown underway in America, strikes what feels like a fairer balance between free markets and consumer protection. This approach gives the crypto markets latitude to evolve on their own while also incentivizing higher levels of disclosure from those who seek to make money selling to those markets.  The tantalizing possibility here is that the U.K. Treasury exercises restraint with its new powers and that existing, regulated market participants with large U.K. presences – companies like BnkToTheFuture and eToro immediately come to mind – might fill the gap and develop businesses that evaluate and prepare marketing disclosures needed to promote the sale of cryptocurrencies available for sale on their platforms, while the government remains hands-off towards developers and software startups operating within its borders.  If the regulators can exercise a bit of self-control and sit on their hands, there’s a good possibility Britain could eat America’s lunch. Whether they can resist temptation remains to be seen.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Preston J.

According to the official statement, this effort is intended to encourage cryptocurrency adoption among numerous fans of American football around the world. The collaboration with the Vienna Vikings marks the Choise.com’s active involvement in the sports industry. As American football is now booming across Europe, this newly forged alliance promises a global wave of interest to the ever-growing crypto ecosystem. Choise.com has already onboarded more than 1 million users in over 170 countries to its platform and keeps spreading awareness about digital assets by joining efforts with the leading brands from various sectors. Why the Vienna Vikings? The Vienna Vikings have dominated American football in Austria for the past two decades. The club boasts a truly rich heritage which includes winning the national Austrian Bowl 15 times in their history, as well as capturing the Eurobowl title 5 times from 2004 to 2007 and in 2013. The beginning of the Vikings’ journey in the ELF, the Europe’s biggest American football tournament, turned out to be striking – they triumphantly won their first season in 2022, beating the Hamburg Sea Devils in the Championship Game with a score of 27-15. This year, the Viennese club is committed to Running It Back and repeating their resounding success in the third season of the ELF. After a continuous streak of 4 wins over the Berlin Thunder, the Prague Lions, the Leipzig Kings, and the Fehervar Enthroners, the Vikings opened further their lead in the standings ahead of matchups against the Raiders Tirol and the Panthers Wroclaw. Next to that, the Vienna Vikings, rooted in the American Football & Cheerleading Club of the Vikings, have established themselves as a powerhouse program with great youth development. Among their most famous inmates are Bernhard Raimann (OL Indianapolis Colts) and Bernhard Seikovits (TE Arizona Cardinals) who are currently shining in the NFL. All this coupled with a persuasive fanbase resulted in the Vienna Vikings becoming the right partner for Choise.com, making its grand entrance into the thriving American football space. The Mutually Beneficial Relationship Choise.com is assured of a beneficial association because of the Vienna Vikings’ palpable affluence within Europe. Meanwhile, by collaborating with the reigning ELF champion, the platform will enhance the club’s branding in several aspects such as the team’s apparel, social media presence, and stadium. On top of the Choise.com logo featuring prominently in all official helmets, there is another joint initiative that has been planned for execution as well. Through their partnership with the Vienna Vikings, Choise.com intends to launch a unique line of Crypterium cards with a bespoke design celebrating the club and its team members. Crypterium card is a VISA card available for order in over 30 countries. Choise.com users can issue both virtual and plastic versions of the card, replenish it from their wallets, make worldwide payments wherever VISA is accepted, as well as withdraw cash from ATMs in more than 200 countries.To date, the product already serves over 50,000 clients. On June 24, the Vikings demonstrated their newly branded helmets for the first time. This happened during their inaugural matchup against the Leipzig Kings. The game started with the opening ceremony during which the CEO of Choise.com Vladimir Gorbunov together with his son did the honorary coin toss in the center of the Hohe Warte stadium. But the real cherry on the cake was the incredible victory of the Vienna Vikings who defeated their rivals 47-14 in acknowledgment of a longstanding cooperation with the crypto platform. Since that day, the team has remained unbeaten and only strengthened their positions in the standings after the latest triumph over the Fehervar Enthrodes, 41-12. Choise.com is an all-purpose crypto platform offering a broad set of crypto banking services at the junction of CeFi and DeFi. This includes purchasing and earning crypto in interest accounts, Web3 staking, generating profits from NFTs, as well as trying out dual-currency investments with high yields. You can also enjoy all the platform’s features on the go by downloading the Choise.com mobile app. What else makes Choise.com stand out from the competition is its latest state-of-art product – BitDriven index token overseen by acclaimed cryptocurrency researchers and analysts. Through this tool users can gain exposure to the portfolio of the most promising coins with a persuasive performance history and good fundamental reasons for substantial growth. The collective value of this portfolio is supposed to grow up to x12 after the 2024 Bitcoin halving. Choise.com will provide support to the Vienna Vikings throughout the entire 2023 season, bringing digital assets closer than ever before to thousands of its enthusiastic fans.

The platform features a decentralized exchange (DEX) and a lending protocol, both integrated with Interlay’s existing DeFi bridge – a system connecting multiple blockchains – that was launched last year and is powered by the wrapped token InterBTC (iBTC). Wrapped tokens are synthetic (or tokenized) versions of crypto assets that are not native to the blockchains on which they exist.  Read more: Polkadot Now Has a Decentralized Version of 'Wrapped' Bitcoin  Interlay says its new bitcoin DeFi hub plans to fill the void left by the closure of peer-to-peer bitcoin exchanges like LocalBitcoins and Paxful earlier in the year and the multi-billion dollar flight from two of the world’s largest crypto exchanges – Binance and Coinbase – precipitated by the current U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits targeting the two centralized platforms.  “LocalBitcoins closed, Paxful had issues,” said Interlay CEO and Co-founder Alexei Zamyatin in an interview with CoinDesk. “We focus on trying to unlock additional functionality for bitcoin and we try to be an alternative to centralized exchanges.”  The 30-year-old computer science PhD graduate describes the new platform as a combination of Uniswap, a popular DEX and Aave and Compound, open-source protocols for liquidity and lending, respectively.  The hub reportedly features not only bitcoin (BTC), but also tether (USDT), polkadot (DOT), and Interlay’s governance token INTR. Liquid staking tokens, or portable tokens that represent staked cryptocurrencies “are expected in Q3” while assets from Ethereum and Cosmos may become available by year’s end, according to the project.  This cornucopia of tokens may irk some Bitcoin purists, but Zamyatin says it’s a necessary step in bringing “Bitcoin to one billion people.”  “Financial freedom means different things to different people,” Zamyatin explained. “For some, it means that they can hedge against fiat by buying bitcoin and just holding it, but not everybody earns and has enough capital to be able to just put something aside and use it as an investment.

Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Sustains Weekly Run With 16% Gain – What Fuels It? It is worth noting that the price of AAVE declined for a few days after touching the $75 mark on June 26. This fall caused the token to shed most of its price gain at the time. However, the DeFi token appears to have fully recovered from this loss, with its yearly high of $91.73 now in sight. According to historical price data, there seems to be resistance at the $80 price zone. So the AAVE token would need to overcome this barrier in order to make its way to $90 again. If the coin fails to break this threshold, it could experience a slight retracement to find support at the $70 price level. CoinGecko data shows that AAVE currently trades at $75.81, losing more than 2% of its value in the past 24 hours. This signals a waning buying pressure, which could hamper the token’s chance of breaking the $80 resistance zone.

This comes in response to the recent controversy surrounding the stablecoin. This proposal will prevent users from depositing or borrowing TUSD on the Aave V2 Ethereum pool. “This AIP (Aave Improvement Proposal) is designed to take a conservative approach to the TUSD situation,” the proposal read. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Gains By 10% Ahead Of July Token Release TUSD jitters started after its technology partner Prime Trust was rumored to have gone bankrupt. These issues were compounded when the embattled Fintech company shut off withdrawals and deposits due to pressure from Nevada state regulators. Although TrueUSD has halted the minting of its stablecoin via Prime Trust, there is still some uncertainty surrounding the use of its assets. And losing its dollar peg in the month of June didn’t help its case. This AIP to freeze TUSD reserves received overwhelming support, as nearly 84% of voters approved it. However, it is worth noting that users will still be able to repay and withdraw their TUSD from the stablecoin pool.

The platform, which enables decentralized identity, plans to design a private and secure system to prevent the tracking and correlation of transactions, as well as prevent fraud and money laundering.  The Bank of England (BoE) launched its consultation on a central bank digital currency in February, and said then that a digital pound was likely needed but that it would not make a decision on issuing one until at least 2025. Digital pound privacy is a topic that has been raised by lawmakers in the past.  Nuggets said that it plans to implement zero-knowledge proofs on its privacy layer, which will enable people to verify their identity without sharing their data.  Alastair Johnson is the founder and CEO of Nuggets, which he started in 2016 with co-founder Seema Khinda Johnson. Nuggets initially worked with the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and the BoE on a project to connect monetary authorities and the private sector to facilitate retail digital currency payments called Project Rosalind. Off the back of that work, Nuggets was asked by the BoE to investigate and design the privacy layer for the digital pound, a company spokesperson said.

Cryptos Can Be Seized Under New Bill? In a significant move to combat cryptocurrency-related crime, the UK House of Lords has passed a bill that empowers authorities to seize and freeze digital assets involved in illegal activities. The legislation aims to address the growing concern of cryptocurrencies being exploited by criminals for money laundering, fraud, and other illicit purposes. The bill, titled “Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill,” received overwhelming support from the House of Lords on Tuesday. Under the provisions of the bill, authorities will have the power to freeze and seize cryptocurrencies suspected to be linked to criminal enterprises. The bill had been previously amended to include terrorism cases. The legislation also mandates exchanges and custodian services to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, providing them with access to relevant transactional information. How Is The Bill Becoming A Law? The bill was first introduced in September 2022, when Director General of the National Crime Agency, Graeme Biggar, said, ""Domestic and international criminals have for years laundered the proceeds of their crime and corruption by abusing U.K. company structures, and are increasingly using cryptocurrencies. These reforms – long awaited and much welcomed – will help us crack down on both."" Later in March, the government revealed its three-year economic crime agenda which including the fight against criminal abuse of crypto. As a part of the agenda to help identify digital assets linked to criminal activities, crypto tactical advisers have been incorporated into nationwide police departments. In the next step, the bill will now proceed to the House of Commons for further review and debate. It will be passed back and forth between the chambers of Parliament until the House of Lords and the House of Commons both sign off on the document. Once an agreement is reached, it will be presented before the king, who can then sign it into law. UK Continues Its Crypto Stride The UK government has recognized the need to adapt its legal framework to keep pace with technological advancements and emerging threats in the digital realm. Most recently, the House of Lords passed the Financial Services and Markets Bill to regulate Bitcoin and crypto in the UK. By bringing cryptocurrencies under the purview of existing anti-money laundering and asset forfeiture regulations, the bill aims to close existing loopholes and strengthen the country's financial integrity.

According to data by CoinMarketCap, ZIL has now gained 10.13% in the last 24 hours, emerging as the top gainer of the day. Zilliqa Network Upgrade Now Underway According to a tweet by Zilliqa’s official Twitter handle, its mainnet network upgrade v9.2 has commenced today, July 5, as scheduled. This network upgrade is expected to introduce vital improvements to the Zilliqa network, most notably increased interoperability between the Scilla – the platform’s customized smart contract language – and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Related Reading: Stablecoins Volume Down Despite Crypto Market Recovery, Ratings Agency Finds Furthermore, the upgrade will look to augment Zilliqa’s security and functionality by extending support for third-party EVM contracts and implementing full backward compatibility with all existing Scilla (v0.13.3) contracts. That said, as the Zilliqa network upgrade got closer, its native token, ZIL, has experienced significant buying pressure in the last few days. Most notably, in the early hours of today, ZIL gained by 11% moving from $0.0222 to hit a price of $0.0247 for the first time since the first week of June. Following that price gain, the ZIL token witnessed a slight price loss finding support at the $0.0237 price level and has since remained in that price zone. At the time of writing, Zilliqa (ZIL) is exchanging hands at $0.238, with a 0.10% decrease in the last hour. However, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 189.83% and is valued at $83 million. With a total market cap value of $377 million, Zilliqa is ranked as the 93rd biggest cryptocurrency. Zilliqa’s Price Analysis Looking at ZIL’s hourly chart, the Relative Strength Index shows the token is descending from the overbought zone indicating the bullish run may be over. Furthermore, Ziliqa’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is just about crossing the signal line, meaning a potential incoming bearish run is on the horizon. According to chart data, ZIL appears to have encountered a resistance zone at the $0.0250 price mark. If the bulls are able to increase the buying pressure and push ZIL past this barrier, the token is expected to resume its upward price trajectory. Related Reading: What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? Bulls Aren’t Running Out Of Steam Yet However, a significant level of selling pressure in the market could drive the token’s price as low as $0.0225, which represents its next support level. If this support level falls to hold, ZIL is likely to fall to the price level of $0.02. Launched in 2019, Zilliqa is a public, permissionless blockchain, equipped with a sharded architecture designed to address the scalability and throughput issues common with most blockchains.

A group of Ethereum community members has put forth a new standard, ERC 7265, aiming to enhance the security of DeFi protocols. This standard could be pivotal in mitigating the risk of significant losses due to hacks and other security threats in an increasingly vulnerable DeFi landscape. Alarming Vulnerabilities The decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape has been marred by an upswing in security breaches recently, with protocols including Poly Network, Chibi Finance, Sturdy Finance, Jimbos Protocol on Arbitrum, Hundred Finance, Sentiment, Deus Finance, and Tornado Cash, among others, all falling prey to malicious actors. As these attacks escalate, both in frequency and impact, this proposal addresses some of the risks that the aforementioned exploits represent. The urgency for effective protective measures in the DeFi sector has been driven by several high-profile hacking incidents. These incidents highlight a critical vulnerability in the DeFi sector. Once protocols are compromised, the damage is often irreparable, causing total value locked (TVL) to plummet to zero within seconds. Against this backdrop, the Ethereum community is rallying to propose a standard known as ERC 7265. Circuit Breaker: ERC 7265 The Ethereum community's proposed standard, ERC 7265, suggests the integration of a ""circuit breaker"" into DeFi protocols. This feature could act as a fail-safe in smart contracts, stopping token transactions before they exit contracts during a hack. ""ERC 7265 allows teams to create a circuit breaker protecting their protocol, with highly customized rate limit parameters per asset,"" explains Meir Bank of Fluid Protocol. In the event of a hack, he says, ""the attacker will no longer be able to drain an entire contract in seconds. The majority of funds can be recovered."" The ERC 7265 standard is primarily intended for DeFi protocols that can be upgraded by governance, a common practice in DeFi. Bank assures that this integration carries few downsides and numerous benefits for such governed DeFi protocols. The Path Forward? ERC 7265 is currently in the proposal stage and awaits approval by the broader Ethereum community. If accepted and implemented by core developers, it could become a critical tool in the ongoing battle against DeFi hacks. The proposed ERC 7265 could play a key role in improving Ethereum's ecosystem. It comes in response to ongoing security worries in DeFi protocols, many of which are based on Ethereum. As we see, these requent exploits have shaken trust in these platforms.The Ethereum community's proactive stance in proposing ERC 7265 underscores the industry's commitment to tackling the security issues head-on. As DeFi continues to mature and evolve, protective measures like this circuit breaker may prove crucial in safeguarding protocols and building trust within the community. In the dynamic world of DeFi, one thing remains certain: security must remain at the forefront of every attempt at innovation. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42420015,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUIzZV,1688561111,First Mover Americas: Cryptocurrency Trading Volumes Increase for First Time in 3 Months,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Crypto trading volumes rose in June for the first time in three months amid optimism following the filing of spot bitcoin exchange-traded-fund (ETF) proposals by BlackRock and other asset managers. The combined spot and derivative trading volumes on centralized exchanges climbed 14% to $2.71 trillion, according to a report by CCData. This was the first monthly increase in trading volume since March, said the report. Among other high-profile U.S. institutions that filed or refiled last month with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot bitcoin ETFs were Fidelity, Invesco and WisdomTree.  Bitcoin's fortune is no longer tied to movement in the U.S. stock markets. The 90-day rolling correlation of changes in bitcoin's spot price to changes in Wall Street's tech-heavy equity index, Nasdaq and the broader S&P 500 has declined to near zero, the lowest in two years, according to data tracked by crypto derivatives analytics firm Block Scholes. ""It [the correlation] is now at the lowest level observed since July 2021, when BTC was between its twin peaks in April and November,"" Andrew Melville, research analyst at Block Scholes, said in an email.  Binance Australia’s office was searched by that country's financial regulator, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC), on Tuesday, according to a report in Bloomberg. The story, citing anonymous sources, comes after the company’s derivatives license was canceled in April following an investigation into how it classified clients as professional wholesale investors in order to be saddled fewer regulatory protections than if they were regular retail customers. ""We are cooperating with local authorities and Binance is focused on meeting local regulatory standards in order to serve our users in Australia in a fully compliant manner,” a Binance Australia spokesperson told CoinDesk in an e-mailed statement.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows notional open interest, or the dollar amount locked in the number of active options contracts tied to bitcoin, has surged to $13.8 billion.  Market participants are seeking exposure to risk-defined derivatives instruments, per Glassnode.  Glassnode tracks open interest on Deribit, CME, FTX and OKX.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Denmark's Financial Watchdog Orders Saxo Bank to Shed its Crypto Holdings  Aave Holders Vote on Proposal for DeFi Protocol to Convert 1,600 Ether Into wstETH and rETH  Bitcoin May Be Forming a 'Bull Flag' on Price Chart: Technical Analysis",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/05/first-mover-americas-cryptocurency-trading-volumes-increase-for-first-time-in-three-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/100b4a71aac061ebc12944822d9f7d9886a46d57-1464x673.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14538331,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541290,1688558432,"Bitcoin Humpback Wallets Reach ATH, Is BlackRock Behind The Surge?","A recent development has caught the attention of on-chain analysts and Bitcoin enthusiasts alike. On-chain expert Axel Adler Jr, citing data from CryptoQuant, has revealed that wallets belonging to the ‘Humpback’ cohort, have reached a new all-time high (ATH). This surge has raised speculation about the involvement of institutional giants such as BlackRock or Fidelity. Remarkably, not only humpback but also shrimps are currently displaying a historical high conviction. The Phenomenon Of Bitcoin Humpback Wallets The term ‘Humpback’ refers to a specific cohort of wallets within the cryptocurrency ecosystem that hold an impressive amount of Bitcoin, surpassing the 5,000 BTC mark. The recent surge in these wallets reaching an ATH indicates a significant level of accumulation and activity within the crypto market. Related Reading: What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? Bulls Aren’t Running Out Of Steam Yet According to Axel Adler Jr, “The number of wallets in the ‘Humpback’ cohort with a balance of over 5,000 BTC has shown a new ATH. Is this BlackRock, Fidelity, or other giants?” The mystery surrounding the identity of these major players has piqued curiosity and speculation about their motivations and impact on the market. From the on-chain data alone, it is not possible to determine which entity commenced the accumulation of BTC. However, the temporal connection with the ETF applications is striking. Regardless of the actual entity, a whale accumulation can be interpreted as a positive sign for the price. In this vein, expert Will Clemente recently stated: Even if Blackrock/Fidelity refile and the ETFs still get rejected by Gary, the cat is out of the bag — institutions want your Bitcoin and are looking to get a piece of this market. It is worth noting that Bitcoin’s whale & shark addresses (different cohorts combined, wallets with 10 to 10,000 BTC) have continued to accumulate, with a big chunk of BTC buying coming in the last 2 weeks of June as news of ETF launches came out. On-chain-data provider Santiment tweeted on July 1 that the aforementioned cohorts have accumulated 154,500 BTC in the last week of June alone. ‘Shrimps’ Show Crazy Conviction While the activity by Humpback wallets is astonishing another intriguing cohort known as the ‘Shrimps’ has also come into focus. Lead analyst of Glassnode, Checkmate highlighted today the enthusiasm displayed by the Shrimp cohort in stacking sats (satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin) at an astonishing rate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could See Fresh “Liftoff” if It’s Able to Hold One Key Level He states, “Bitcoin Shrimp (< 1 $BTC) are stacking sats at a rate of 33.8k $BTC per month. Issuance is ~27.0k $BTC/month. For every 1 new coin, Shrimp are taking 1.25 off the market. Crazy conviction on display.” The Shrimp cohort, consisting of smaller Bitcoin holders, showcases an incredible conviction and sustained buying behavior despite market fluctuations. As Checkmate points out, “The last time the little guy stacked this hard was 2017 ATH, buying the top. Five years later, they are stacking harder, faster, and in a more sustained manner, despite all the bullshit. Bullish.” The simultaneous rise of both the Humpback and Shrimp cohorts signifies a captivating dichotomy within the ecosystem. On one hand, the Humpback wallets, with their massive holdings, hint at the potential involvement of institutional giants like BlackRock or Fidelity. Their accumulation of Bitcoin could serve as a catalyst for increased adoption and market confidence. On the other hand, the resilience and conviction displayed by the Shrimp cohort highlight the broader appeal and democratization of BTC. Despite previous market downturns, the Shrimp class remains undeterred, stacking sats at an unprecedented pace and demonstrating unwavering belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. At press time, the BTC price continued to hover below the $31,000 mark, trading at $30,728.

14538261,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/bayc-hits-20-month-low,1688558220,BAYC Hits 20-Month Low,"The floor price of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection has dropped to the lowest in the last 20 months. BAYC Drops Below 30 ETH The forecast does not look good for NFTs, as the most popular collection ever, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), has sunk to a 20-month low. According to a report from the data analytics platform, CoinGecko, the floor price of the NFT collection from the iconic Yuga Labs drastically fell to 27.4 ETH, which is around $53,000 on Sunday evening. NFT marketplace OpenSea claimed that the collection’s trading volume has dropped by a significant 38% in just 24 hours. It did recover from the bottom, however, slightly, settling around 29.5 ETH at the time of writing. 50% Decrease Since April The floor price is the lowest value a seller is willing to accept for an NFT and is a crucial indicator of the NFT’s demand and popularity. For the BAYC collection, the floor price has experienced a 50% decrease since April of this year. At the beginning of the month, it was being traded at 64 ETH, equivalent to approximately $126,000. However, across the month, pseudonymous collector Franklin sold 27 NFTs from his BAYC collection, which must have compounded the lack of interest further, dropping the floor price to a five-month low of 55.6 ETH, or about $110,000. Collectors Questioning BAYC Investment This is tough news for the collection, which has almost always seen high demand. In fact, the last time its floor price was below 30 ETH was back in October 2021. However, soon after, the NFT boom hit, and BAYC’s floor price skyrocketed to new all-time highs. The Bored Ape Yacht Club, a popular and highly sought-after NFT collection known for its unique pixelated ape characters, had garnered significant attention and fetched substantial prices in the past, its highest being 153.7 ETH (approximately $430,000) in April 2022. However, the recent drop in floor prices has caught many collectors off guard, leaving them questioning the future of the collection and the broader NFT market. Many Challenges For NFT Market Other than the overall bearish market, experts also believe that the initial frenzy and hype surrounding NFTs have subsided, leading to a decline in demand and, subsequently, lower prices. According to OpenSea, this could be a result of the long crypto winter that pulled down the price of Ethereum. As a result, this has affected the price of the NFT collections like BAYC, which are powered by Ethereum. Other collections affected by the crypto winter are MoonBirds, Azuki, Doodles, and others. Moreover, the BAYC collection itself has seen a surge in supply that has put additional pressure on the prices, leading to the significant drop witnessed recently. Additionally, the increased regulatory scrutiny toward NFTs and the broader cryptocurrency industry has introduced an element of uncertainty, causing some investors to pull back and leading to a decline in prices.

""Saxo Bank A/S' trading in crypto assets for its own account has taken place in order to cover risks in connection with the offering of other financial products,"" the statement said.

The financial watchdog also said that since the European Union's crypto regulation, known as markets for cryptoassets regulation (MiCA), only comes into effect from 30 December 2024, the activity is unregulated for the time being.

14536694,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541273,1688554552,Lido (LDO) Sustains Weekly Run With 16% Gain – What Fuels It?,"Lido (LDO), a prominent player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, has emerged as a frontrunner in the rapidly expanding Liquidity Staking Derivatives (LSD) sector. Amidst the turbulence caused by the highly controversial lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has found itself in a state of uncertainty and caution. This legal battle has prompted many projects to reevaluate their strategies and has made investors more cautious in their approach. However, even in this challenging climate, the LSD space has managed to experience substantial growth and defy the odds. LSD Sector’s Dominance And Lido’s Remarkable Performance As per data from Messari, the LSD sector has demonstrated significant dominance in the cryptocurrency markets. One of the leading contributors to the sector’s expansion has been Lido, which has showcased impressive performance over recent months. SEC lawsuits against @BinanceUS and @Coinbase cause #DeFi TVL to plummet below $60B. But amidst the chaos, liquid staking protocols are thriving becoming DeFi’s dominating force by TVL. pic.twitter.com/RL9Qy8cwLE — Messari (@MessariCrypto) July 3, 2023 CoinGecko reports that currently, the price of Lido’s native token, LDO, stands at $2.16. While there has been a slight decline of 1.7% in the past 24 hours, the token has experienced a solid 15.7% increase in value during the last seven days. Source: Coingecko The surge in LDO’s price has also resulted in a noticeable increase in the MVRV ratio of the token. This signifies that a considerable number of addresses holding LDO have become profitable in the past few days, indicating a positive sentiment among investors and further fueling the success of Lido in the competitive DeFi landscape. Growth Amidst Concerns: Lido Declining APR Despite the notable growth and success witnessed by Lido, there has been a recent decline in the Annual Percentage Return (APR) offered by the platform. According to a recent LDO price report, his decline in APR over the past few days raises concerns about the attractiveness of using Lido for staking, potentially leading users to seek alternative options. Source: Dune Analytics The declining APR indicates that the rewards and returns generated from staking LDO tokens on the Lido platform have decreased. This development could discourage some users who prioritize maximizing their staking yields from continuing to use Lido. LDO market cap currently at $1.9 billion. Chart: TradingView.com As staking rewards play a crucial role in incentivizing users to participate in networks and secure their protocols, a sustained decline in APR might prompt individuals to explore alternative platforms that offer more competitive and potentially higher returns. Related Reading: Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor To maintain its position as a leading player in the LSD sector, Lido would need to address the declining APR and explore avenues to enhance the rewards offered to stakers, ensuring they remain competitive and appealing to their user base.

The combined spot and derivative trading volumes on centralized exchanges climbed 14% to $2.71 trillion, according to a report by CCData. That's the first monthly increase since March, said the report.  Several high-profile U.S. institutions filed or refiled for spot bitcoin ETFs with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month, including Invesco and WisdomTree, along with Fidelity.  “The increase in volatility following the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance US and Coinbase, and the positive outlook in the market following the filing of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, have contributed to an increase in trading activity last month,” said CCData.  Still, spot trading volumes remain at historically low levels. Spot trading volume in the second quarter was the lowest since Q4 2019, according to the report.  For the derivatives market, volumes increased by 14% in June, representing 78.7% of the crypto market. That, however, is down from 79.1% in May, marking the first drop in derivatives market share in four months, an indication that the EFT filings spurred spot accumulation of crypto assets, according to the report.

The crypto market is in calmer waters currently as it looks to bitcoin to make that definitive move past $31,000. Given the sheer scale of the resistance above, bitcoin will need to gather the help of all the bulls in order to be successful. Momentum still gathering One of its main weapons to surpass the resistance will be momentum, and short term Stochastic RSIs are resetting to the bottom as bitcoin traverses sideways. The daily timeframe RSI would be a major help, and this is now passing the halfway point on its way down. Once at the bottom and the signal lines cross up this can be a major sign that bitcoin has the impetus to make the break. Bullish chart patterns Having started this particular attack on resistance on June 15, the price reached a high on June 23 before traversing sideways, forming a bull flag as it went. The measured move for the flag is $36,000, the next real level of resistance after $31,000. Another, even more bullish chart pattern has reached completion. This is a potential cup and handle pattern that started to form in early June 2022. The cup was completed on April 14 this year, and now the handle has also been completed. The measured move for this would be a massive move to $46,000. Institutional buying just around the corner If one takes into account the potential for enormous institutional buying should the Blackrock Spot Bitcoin ETF, and others be approved, then the second of these technical targets wouldn’t be out of bitcoin’s reach. In spite of impending regulation for cryptocurrencies and all sorts of log jams being thrust into the sector by traditional financial agencies that now see crypto as a real threat to fiat currencies, the mood in the crypto sector is certainly a lot better than it was back in the depths of crypto winter back in November last year. Regulation should have the effect of bringing in much larger capital into the space, and although this is also likely to bring in a lot of the unfairness against the average investor and bias towards the institutions just as it is in the traditional financial system, it is to be hoped that the market and changing technology will bring about a more level playing field. Even if a rejection for bitcoin happens now, instead of the widely expected breakthrough, this is only likely to be a temporary setback. Just a quick glance at how banks and fiat currencies are doing right now is enough to solidify that scenario. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14535339,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541086,1688551247,Aptos (APT) Gains By 10% Ahead Of July Token Release,"APT, the native token of the Aptos Network, is currently making market waves as it prepares for its upcoming token release in July. According to data by CoinMarketCap, APT has gained by 10.14% in the last 24 hours, emerging as part of the top gainers in today’s market. Aptos Anticipates New Token Release According to data from the token tracker site Token Unlocks, 4.54 million APT tokens, valued at $36.94 million, are scheduled to be released on July 12. This upcoming token release will account for 2.17% of the total circulating supply. For investors familiar with the APT market, this is quite normal, as the Aptos Network is programmed to unlock new tokens on the 12th of each month. These tokens are released to the Aptos Foundation as well as its user community to support ecosystem projects, provide grants, and push other community growth initiatives. Related Reading: Coinbase Stock Soars Nearly 12% As BlackRock Reveals Surveillance Partnership However, while APT is currently gaining, the effects of token release on the market are unpredictable, as seen in previous times. In January, APT witnessed a jump of over 50% following the scheduled unlock but fell by 13% in February after the same event occurred. Following the launch of the Aptos Mainnet in October 2022, the total supply of APT tokens stood at 1 billion. Of this amount, data from Token Unlocks shows that 166.35 million APT tokens have been unlocked so far, representing only 17% of the total supply. APT Price Analysis On Saturday, October 19, 2022, the Aptos (APT) token made an impressive debut in the crypto market, reaching a market price of $100. However, this was followed by a sharp downturn as the price plunged to the $3.5 level. Over the next three months, APT gradually recovered and climbed to the $20.00 price zone, where it was resisted. Since then, the token has experienced an overall bearish trend losing over 58% of its value to date. APT Trading At $8.15 On The 1-Hour Chart | Source: APTUSD Chart On Tradingview.com Looking at the APT hourly chart, the token’s current price movement suggests it has encountered a resistance zone at the price level of $8.33. If APT is able to break through this barrier, it will continue its bullish momentum and possibly trade as high as $8.82, which appears to be the next resistance zone. Related Reading: USDC Circulating Supply Down 38% Since Jan. 1 – Will It Affect Price? However, failure to push past the $8.33 price mark may induce a bearish trend with the possibility of the token falling to a market price of $7.14, which represents the next support level. At the time of writing, APT is currently trading at $8.1556, with a 0.17% decrease in the last hour. The token’s daily trading volume is also up by $276 million, with a 137% gain. Aptos stands as the 33rd biggest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $2 billion.

The Aave token is up by 7.24% in the past 24 hours.  The proposal has 252,000 votes out of a required 320,000 at press time and closes in two days.

The accusations arise from the release of Azuki’s Elementals collection, which launched last month, with buyers complaining that the NFTs are extremely similar to the original set, sold in 2022. A Frustrated Community The latest collection, called Elementals, could only be minted by users who held the original Azuki collection and a side project called BEANZ. The new set of NFTs, which represented half a suite of a collection of 20,000 profile pictures (PFPs), sold out in less than 15 minutes. The sale was able to raise 20,000 ETH ($39.4 million) for Chiru Labs, the LA-based startup that is behind the NFT collection, having a mint price of 2 ETH ($3900). The original Azuki collection had a floor price of 6.3 ETH ($12,400). However, after the sale, some buyers began complaining that the new collection was too similar to the original Azuki PFPs sold in 2022. The Snapshot proposal states, “We have provided support to Azuki during its highs and lows. We have contributed to building a sub-community and promoting the brand in various ways, mostly on social media such as Redbook, Twitter, and in our discord. Despite our efforts, we have only been given a similar profile picture to that of the original Azuki holders and nothing more. The team is blatantly scamming us with empathy checks and promises.” If passed, the DAO proposal would look for a lawyer to initiate a suit against the pseudo-anonymous co-founder of Azuki, Zagabond. It would also seek a refund, with all funds directed towards the project’s growth and supporting research required for the lawsuit. Zagabond is the pseudo-anonymous founder of Chiru Labs, Azuki’s parent company. The DAO claims that the Azuki team has done nothing but issue the community members a profile picture similar to that of the original Azuki holders and nothing more and is convinced that the team is scamming them. The DAO members are overwhelmingly in favor of filing a lawsuit against Zagabond, retrieving a refund of 20,000 ETH, and redirecting it towards the project’s growth. “Azuki Dao hires a lawyer and files a lawsuit against Zagabond for rugging multiple projects. Azuki Dao retrieves a refund of 20,000E from the team and allocates it to the Dao to promote the growth of the entire Azuki community and provide rewards and incentives for artists, content creators, and builders.” Zagabond had admitted in 2022 that he had abandoned three NFT projects, Tendies, CryptoPhunks, and CryptoZunks. He had claimed at the time that he was not happy with the development of the projects in question, an admission that had generated significant controversy at the time. So far, voting data has revealed that over 60% of the DAO members have voted in favor of the proposal. Not An Official Organization However, it must also be noted that the Azuki DAO is not an official organization associated with the project. The group claims that it was formed to support the project, with the token being utilized for voting minted just over the weekend and airdropped to Azuki holders. Twitter user @tytaninc highlighted the same, stating that the group could have malicious intent. “Here’s more info on where the original tweet about the AzukiDAO came from. Most Azuki holders have never heard of this group and assume it’s either fake or a group with malicious intent. The token for voting was minted two days ago, sooo there’s that.” Azuki Team Addresses Backlash The Azuki team addressed the backlash on Twitter, stating that it had missed the mark with the collection and that the mint process was extremely hectic. The team tweeted on their official handle, “This time, we missed the mark,” and acknowledging that “the [profile picture NFTs] feel similar and, even worse, dilutive to Azuki. Azuki’s vision is to build a decentralized brand. Doing so requires great communication and execution, both of which were lacking with the Elementals sale. We know that we lost a piece of trust today, but nothing gets us more motivated to make things right.” The CEO of NFT gaming studio MyMetaverse, Simon Kertonegoro also criticized the project, stating, “It is absolutely the project’s responsibility to create real products that can generate real revenue from outside markets. We need to normalize crypto and NFT projects as having real business models. They need to serve the wider market.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, recent developments have cast a shadow of uncertainty over their perceived stability. As global policymakers continue to grapple with concerns about the crypto sector’s impact on the established financial system, a surprising twist occurred when stress in the US banking industry reverberated throughout the stablecoin market. According to Fitch Ratings, the tightening of financial conditions, culminating in the high-profile failures of several banks, notably including the collapse of the esteemed Silicon Valley Bank, had a profound impact on stablecoins. Stablecoins: Market Shakeup For instance, Fitch Ratings reports that the market capitalization of USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, experienced a sharp decline of over 25% in the first quarter. Although the coin’s value remains depressed, Fitch noted that it managed to recover its peg soon after. Related Reading: Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor According to data from The Block, the total supply of stablecoins has decreased from $138 billion at the beginning of the year to $124 billion as of July 3. This decline in supply further underscores the challenges faced by stablecoins and their struggle to maintain stability amidst market turbulence. Chart: The Block Crypto Data “Significant volatility, shaken investor confidence, and temporary but sharp de-pegging occurred in the stablecoin market in March as shockwaves spread from traditional finance,” Fitch wrote. Tether Bucks Trend In contrast to USDC, Tether, another prominent stablecoin, observed a 12% increase in its market capitalization during the same period. Notably, Tether captured approximately 72% of USDC’s redemption volume, indicating a growing preference for Tether among investors. Related Reading: Litecoin $100 Milestone Indicates Promising Bullish Trends – Here’s Why Despite Tether’s positive performance, the top 10 stablecoins experienced a decline in their monthly average of daily trading volumes. From March to May 2023, these trading volumes decreased from $53 billion to $28 billion. This reduction signifies a decrease in activity within the stablecoin market, possibly driven by cautious investor sentiment in the face of ongoing market uncertainties. Bitcoin approaches the $31K territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com Fitch noted that efforts to regulate stablecoins have been unfolding at varying speeds in the United States and Europe, leading to notable differences in the reporting and transparency standards of these digital assets. The contrasting approaches taken by the two regions have resulted in distinct regulatory landscapes for stablecoins, causing direct consequences on their reporting and transparency practices.

14532301,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541238,1688543718,What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? Bulls Aren’t Running Out Of Steam Yet,"After Bitcoin reached a new yearly high at $31,413, the buy side has so far failed to initiate a trend-following move north. Although the bulls fended off a sell-off last Friday in the wake of the SEC’s perceived concerns over a Bitcoin spot ETF approval, the momentum seems to be increasingly flattening, or isn’t it? What’s Next For The Bitcoin Price? As the market awaits an approval from the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), investors are seemingly exercising caution. While open interest in the Bitcoin futures market continues to rise, activity in the spot market has recently declined. This shift indicates that price action in recent days has been primarily influenced by futures traders. Analyst @52Skew noted on Twitter, “$BTC Spot CVDs & Delta: Quite a bit of spot still being dumped on the market + no limit chasing today from coinbase buyers. Spot bid liquidity $30.5K.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Stampede: Bitfinex Report Points To Early Signs Of Bull Market This observation underscores the reluctance of investors in the spot market who may be waiting for a decisive move by the SEC. However, it should be noted that US markets were closed yesterday for the 4th of July holiday. Most recently, huge spot buying volume came from Coinbase, pushing the market up. So today will be interesting to watch if yesterday’s retracement is bought today by US investors. Bitcoin dominance, which had risen to resistance at 52.15%, has now consolidated somewhat, dropping to 51.25%. This consolidation, combined with the entry of investors into the altcoin sector, reinforces the prevailing wait-and-see attitude among investors. Analyzing the Bitcoin price, it is clear that the market is currently facing strong resistance in the $31,300 to $31,416 range. The support area at $30,700 is currently proving to be a critical mark to watch. Holding above this support could give buyers the opportunity to launch a renewed offense. If the Bitcoin price can break out dynamically above the year-to-date high, the next major chart hurdle awaits at $32,500. Yet, a temporary retracement to the support area at $29,800 could be acceptable to gain momentum for the next breakout attempt. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here? So far, the bears have lacked follow-through. The sell side also failed in its attempt to sell off the BTC price in the higher time frames back below the psychologically important $30,000 level in recent days. The goal of the bears must be to push Bitcoin permanently below $29,800. Experts Remain Bullish For Now Renowned analyst Josh Rager believes the pullbacks won’t be as deep as many experts expect, suggesting that ETF approval, particularly from BlackRock, is a real possibility. He says, “Only an ETF rejection can cause pain, but I think BlackRock will be approved this time,” adding: The $24k, then up sentiment seems to be quite popular. I think people are overthinking it. Similar was said about Bitcoin needing to sweep $20k first. IMO, pullbacks won’t be this deep now and if we manage to see $25k again it won’t be until later on in the year after more upside before so. Similarly, NewsBTC lead analyst Tony “The Bull” believes in the bullish case for BTC in the near term. However, he stresses the importance of Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) entering overbought territory, as a failure to do so could indicate a lack of strong upside momentum: I want to see Bitcoin RSI push into overbought conditions by week end, or else I worry that this isn’t an impulse yet. We have a doji on the weekly, which signals indecision. We need to see follow through this week, or more correction becomes more probable w/ possible bear div.

The latest bill reinforces the perception in crypto circles that legal firms are raking in the money at the expense of the creditors they are representing. A Hefty Legal Bill The bill for legal services provided by the law firm was revealed in a legal filing submitted to the United States Bankruptcy Court of New York’s Southern District on the 3rd of July, 2022. The latest bill brings the total compensation charged to the group of creditors to over $16 million, significantly above the $11.2 million initially budgeted as part of the restructuring process. The creditors have so far paid $8.9 million in legal fees to the firm. According to the filing, the blended hourly rate for all timekeepers stands at $1026.76. Some of the biggest areas of billing from attorneys of McDermott Will & Emery for the stipulated months in question include $1 million billed for nearly 917 hours of work on plan and disclosure settlement. This includes discussing sale options with debtors, meeting potential buyers, and examining objections that other stakeholders have presented. In previous fee periods, significant work was carried out on plan and disclosure settlement during a potential sale of Voyager assets to FTX. However, this deal collapsed when FTX itself filed for bankruptcy. This legal bill comes over, and above a $1.1 million bill that Voyager paid to the law firm Kirkland & Ellis for work it completed when representing the exchange. Law Firms Make Merry The market downturn has led to many crypto firms going bankrupt, something that has been highly profitable for law firms. Voyager itself had filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after the firm revealed it had considerable exposure to Three Arrows Capital, the collapsed crypto hedge fund. Voyager then tried to broker deals with several entities, including FTX and Binance. However, the FTX deal fell through after the Sam Bankman-Fried-led exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The FTX bankruptcy was the largest bankruptcy in the crypto industry thus far. Following these developments, Binance backed out of the potential deal in April 2023, citing a hostile regulatory climate prevailing in the United States, thanks to the position taken on crypto by current United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved a liquidation plan for Voyager which would see its customers being reimbursed $1.33 billion in digital assets. The entire legal process has resulted in Voyager having to spend a fortune on legal fees. Last week, reports emerged that Kirkland & Ellis, the law firm representing Voyager, charged the company $1.1 million for work it had completed in April of this year. One Man’s Loss Is Another’s Gain The crypto winter, which started with the de-pegging of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin UST and the collapse of its entire ecosystem, set off a domino effect in the crypto space. As a result of the collapse, the contagion spread, leading to the collapse of several prominent crypto entities. This list includes Vauld, Celsius, Hodlnaut, BlockFi, Voyager, and FTX, entities that were considered leading lights in the crypto space. Lawyers and legal firms have taken full advantage, making a significant amount from the beleaguered firms in the form of legal fees. In December 2022, lawyers representing bankrupt crypto lender Celsius, one of the first casualties of the crypto winter, billed the firm nearly $53 million in legal fees for the period beginning since the firm filed for bankruptcy until October of the same year. Celsius had filed for Chapter 11 in Mid-July, 2022. FTX, the biggest casualty of the crypto winter, has run up a legal bill of over $200 million since the time it filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. It is also worth noting that FTX going bankrupt impacted over 130 entities that were affiliated with the exchange. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14530601,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541212,1688539828,Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor,"Optimism (OP), a prominent Layer 2 network, is experiencing a noticeable decline in network activity as the hype surrounding meme coins takes a dip. Once bustling with vibrant transactions and a fervent community, Optimism now faces a subdued atmosphere as users shift their attention away from these speculative assets. The decrease in meme coin fervor has had a direct impact on the overall engagement within the Optimism network, prompting questions about its long-term viability and adaptability in an ever-changing crypto landscape. Can the Layer 2 network adapt to evolving market trends and sustain its relevance in the face of shifting investor preferences? Declining OP Price And Network Activity Raise Concerns The price of OP on CoinGecko is currently at $1.29, indicating a 4.3% decline in the past 24 hours. However, despite this recent downturn, the coin has managed to sustain a seven-day rally of 1.5%, suggesting potential resilience and market support. Source: Coingecko Nevertheless, Optimism, the Layer 2 network housing decentralized exchanges (DEXes), has witnessed a significant decrease in daily on-chain transaction volume, leading to a concerning 59% decline over the past week. A new OP price report reveals a decline in network activity on the OP Mainnet since mid-June.

The 90-day rolling correlation of changes in bitcoin's spot price to changes in Wall Street's tech-heavy equity index, Nasdaq, and the broader index, S&P 500, has declined to near zero. That's the lowest in two years, according to data tracked by crypto derivatives analytics firm Block Scholes.  ""It [the correlation] is now at the lowest level observed since July 2021, when BTC was between its twin peaks in April and November,"" Andrew Melville, research analyst at BlockScholes, said in an email.  ""The fall in correlation has happened as both assets have retraced losses sustained throughout last year's tightening cycle,"" Melville added.  The dwindling correlation with traditional risk assets means that crypto traders focusing solely on traditional market sentiment and macroeconomic developments may face disappointment.  ETF narrative  The recent spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings by BlackRock (BLK), Fidelity, WisdomTree (WT), VanEck, Invesco (IVZ) and others have brought optimism to the crypto market.  Since BlackRock's filing on June 15, bitcoin has produced a return of 25%, ignoring the range bound activity in the U.S. stock indices.  Per Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, the ETF narrative can be broken down into three parts – frontrunning the launch, flows post-the-spot ETFs go live and validation of crypto as an asset class.  ""Investment product flow in coming months could be a litmus test for the latter, so I’ll be watching it closely,"" Solot tweeted.  To the bears' dismay, investor interest in exchange-traded products has increased since June 15.  ""Globally, BTC ETPs experienced inflows of 13,822 BTC in June, with the inflows kicking in after the BlackRock announcement on June 15,"" Vetle Lunde, senior research analyst at K33, said in a note to clients on Tuesday, discussing the impact of the ETF narrative. ""The flows have been strong across jurisdictions, with Canadian and European spot ETPs and U.S. futures ETFs all experiencing solid inflows.""  While the ETF narrative is currently in the driver's seat, some macroeconomic factors, like potential fiat liquidity pressures, still warrant attention, analysts told CoinDesk.

14529467,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/decoding-the-poly-network-exploit,1688536800,Decoding The Poly Network Exploit,"Decoding the Poly Network Exploit: Key Lessons in Smart Contract Security The DeFi world was rocked recently as Poly Network, a decentralized finance protocol that facilitates asset transfers across various blockchains, fell prey to its second major hack. This incident is a stark reminder of the critical role of smart contract security in the rapidly evolving DeFi and crypto industry. On July 2nd, a breach affected Poly Network, with the exploit potentially impacting as many as 57 different asset types across 10 blockchains. According to security analysts, hackers allegedly leveraged a vulnerability in the smart contract system that allowed thgem to mint an unlimited amount of tokens. An estimated $42 billion worth of tokens were minted, although only about $5 million have been reportedly cashed out. Poly Network isn't alone in its security woes. The DeFi and Web3 space has been marred by a series of similar exploits, with millions of dollars worth of digital assets lost to hackers. Many of these attacks, like the one against Poly Network, have leveraged vulnerabilities in smart contract systems. These programmable agreements, which execute transactions automatically when predetermined conditions are met, are a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem but also a prime target for cybercriminals. Severity of the Exploit: Understanding the Consequences The Poly Network hack underscores the severity and potential consequences of smart contract vulnerabilities. In the immediate aftermath, the total value locked on Poly Network plunged from $277 million to $176 million, a clear indication of the loss in user confidence. The ripple effects of such an incident can be wide-ranging, from an erosion of trust in the protocol to a broader negative impact on the DeFi market. Such a hack also highlights the risks involved in the relatively new field of cross-chain transactions. As more DeFi platforms aim to enable seamless transactions across various blockchains, ensuring the security of these cross-chain protocols is a challenge that cannot be overlooked. Analyzing the Exploit: Unpacking the Technical Details The recent Poly Network exploit underpins the role of effective security measures in ensuring the integrity of blockchain networks, especially given the sophistication and complexity of the attack vectors involved. By forging proofs and potentially compromising private keys or executing a multi-signature service attack, the hacker was able to manipulate the LockProxy cross-chain bridge contract. To begin with, the attacker used the lock function to lock a small amount of Lever Token. The subsequent transaction, viewed on the Poly Network explorer, indicated that the action had been validated through the relay chain. However, when the hacker moved to the BNB chain and initiated withdrawal operations via the verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function, the withdrawal quantity did not match the originally locked amount. Further examination of the relay chain network did not show any records of this transaction. At this point, two possibilities were considered: the leakage of signatures or the modification of keepers, entities responsible for signing user withdrawals. Controlling a keeper would allow the attacker to initiate withdrawals with forged signatures, leading to unauthorized transactions. Analyzing the attacker's use of the verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function indicated that keepers had not been modified, directing the suspicion towards compromised keeper private keys or a multi-signature service attack. Following the trail, three keepers were identified as potential compromise victims, underlining a significant security risk. If proven true, this would mean the attacker could initiate withdrawals and create seemingly valid transactions, bypassing the protocols' security measures. Such an exploit demonstrates the need for advanced security strategies, including enhanced private key management and robust signature verification processes. If overlooked, these vulnerabilities can provide potential entry points for attackers to exploit and wreak havoc on blockchain networks, as illustrated by the Poly Network case. With the DeFi and crypto industry still at an early phase of developmental maturity, it's vital for protocol developers to continuously learn from such incidents, fortifying their systems against potential breaches, and upholding user trust. Addressing Smart Contract Vulnerabilities Smart contract vulnerabilities can be mitigated, albeit not entirely eliminated. An effective approach involves a combination of preventive measures and reactive strategies. Preventive measures include rigorous testing of smart contracts before deployment and regular audits by external security firms. These audits can help identify and rectify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Code review and bug bounty programs, where programmers are rewarded for discovering and reporting software bugs, can also be instrumental in fortifying smart contract security. From a reactive standpoint, developers can use upgradeable smart contracts that allow for the modification of the contract's code post-deployment. This feature can be crucial for responding swiftly and effectively to discovered vulnerabilities. Moving forward, it's clear that smart contract security must be at the forefront of DeFi protocol development. As the case of Poly Network demonstrates, the stakes are high, and the fallout from a breach can be devastating. By embracing rigorous security measures and continually learning from past incidents, the DeFi industry can help mitigate these risks and foster a more secure and resilient ecosystem.

14522691,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541174,1688522446,Bitcoin Ordinals: This New BRC Standard Could Reduce Inscription Fees By 90%,"Luminex, a Bitcoin Ordinals launchpad, has proposed a new standard called BRC-69, which will allegedly optimize the costs of inscribing on this network. This proposal comes barely a month after Bitcoin Ordinals’ developers introduced recursive inscriptions to address the block size limit of 4 MB. Unlike normal Ordinals inscriptions, recursive inscriptions can reference each others’ content through a special syntax. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here? BRC-69 Standard Can Reduce Inscription Fees By 90%: Luminex On Monday, June 3, Luminex introduced BRC-69, a new standard that will facilitate the creation of Recursive Ordinals collections. According to the launchpad, this BRC standard will help reduce inscription fees by 90%. In March 2023, the Ordinals protocol was updated to enable the minting of BRC-20 tokens, which have seen a significant level of adoption so far. According to data from Coingecko, there are currently 35,528 BRC-20 tokens in circulation, with a market cap of more than $249 million. The increasing number of BRC-20 inscriptions has led to a scarcity of block space on the Bitcoin network. Consequently, BTC transaction fees have increased as there are more pending transactions. A quarterly report by IntoTheBlock revealed that the Bitcoin network fees surged by more than 300% in 2023 Q2. The BRC-20 standard – and the creation of new tokens – were reported to be one of the major driving forces of the increased on-chain fees. To ease this pressure on the network, Luminex has developed the BRC-69 standard, which it claims to be a “revolutionary standard”. It will help reduce the cost of inscriptions while helping to optimize the Bitcoin block space as the number of inscriptions rises, according to the launchpad. BRC-69 Standard To Cut Inscription Fees In 4 Steps The BRC-69 standard reduces inscription fees in a four-step process of “inscribe traits”, “deploy collection”, “compile collection”, and “mint assets”, Luminex claims. This means that minters only need to inscribe a single line of text instead of a full image. This text will serve as a reference, enabling the final image to be automatically rendered across Ordinals frontends, only using on-chain resources. “The end result? A flawlessly rendered image. Unlike other SVG recursive collections, these images can be dragged, dropped, and saved as typical image type Ordinals,” Luminex said. BTCUSD trading at $30,879 | Source: BTCUSD chart from TradingView In addition to cost efficiency, Luminex’s proposal claims that the BRC-69 standard offers high flexibility and paves the way for other on-chain features. Some of these features include pre-reveal collection launching and on-chain reveals. It is worth mentioning that the Bitcoin Ordinals are still controversial in the cryptocurrency industry, as a large percentage of the Bitcoin community is opposed to the protocol. Many argue that this technology negatively impacts the efficiency and security of the Bitcoin network.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: With a continued long weekend in the U.S., and plenty of economic data coming in this week, markets are quiet.

Bitcoin is down 1.1% to $30,807, while ether is down 0.8% to $1,939. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a measure of crypto markets performance, is down 0.9% to 1,262.  Data from CoinGlass shows that while open interest continues to sustain itself at the $14.38 billion market, trading volume across the board is down, with major exchanges reporting declines between 15-20%. Liquidation volumes reflect this, with only $148,000 in positions liquidated during the last four hours, and $7.2 million liquidated in the last 12 hours.  CoinGlass’ long/short ratio shows that long traders still have a slight edge over shorts, but its polling of trader sentiment reveals a mixed bag, with a large cohort of neutral traders splitting the bullish and bearish crowd.  As CoinDesk has previously reported, liquidity continues to be a going concern, with fiat liquidity on the decline, which might weigh heavily on risk assets like tech stocks and crypto. With plenty of economic data coming down the pipe this week, let’s see how traders react.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Dogecoin DOGE +0.6% Currency  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Decentraland MANA −2.6% Entertainment Terra LUNA −2.4% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM −2.4% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Animoca Co-Founder Siu Shouldn’t Dismiss GameFi’s Ponzi Problem  The GameFi industry is working hard to rid itself of the perception that it’s a cesspool of Ponzi schemes.  During an interview at the Collision web conference in Toronto, Yat Siu, the co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, blew up this effort.  “The narrative around GameFi as a Ponzi is an American narrative. If you go to Asia or the Middle East, you wouldn’t hear any of that,” Siu said in response to a question from YouTuber A.Cole. “That’s due to a misunderstanding of what GameFi really is.”  Ponzi schemes are investment scams promising high rates of return where old investors are paid by new ones, rather than legitimate sustainable business activities. To its critics, GameFi’s Play to Earn model is a ponzi scheme because of its reliance on a wealth transfer from new to old players rather than legitimately engaging gameplay.  Siu continued by arguing that GameFi isn’t about creating financial value, but rather opening up the finances of games to transparency.  Siu isn’t wrong about this part. Games have had economies of scale for quite some time; U.S. political gadfly Steve Bannon made a lot of money in the early 2000s operating a World of Warcraft virtual gold trading desk in Hong Kong.  But he’s being incredibly dismissive about the real problem GameFi has with Ponzis – which others have recognized as something holding the industry back.  In a 2022 essay outlining its investment theses, Vader Research, a Web3 gaming market research shop, argued that the current wave of web3 games are not designed for fun-seeking traditional gamers but are “designed for ponzi-return seeking crypto degens and gold farmer scholars.”  “We believe Ponzis will slow down web3 gaming adoption,” they wrote. “[Many projects] use complex tokenomics to camouflage their Ponzinomics nature will take web3 gaming a few years back in terms of real gamer adoption.”  Vader points to GameFi projects offering of “unrealistic returns,” which they believe not only jeopardizes long-term crypto adoption but also hinders the growth of genuine Web3 gaming.  And a year later, there is some vindication to this idea, as we see what happens when the inflow of resources no longer exceeds the outflow.  Axie Infinity, which was marketed more as a wealth creation scheme rather than a genuinely fun game, saw its AXS token decline by 55% during the last year. The number of players on the platform averaged around 362,000 during the last month from a high of around 2.7 million in January 2022. For many players it hasn’t been profitable for a long time, and its army of Filipino gamers make less than minimum wage.  Data from CryptoRank.io shows that Animoca Brands’ basket of tokens is down 18% over the last 6 months, or, over a longer time horizon, down 17% over three years. In comparison, many other investors are well into the green for either of these time frames considering the mini-bull market of 2023 and the broader growth of crypto over long time horizons.  A16z, for instance, is up 20% over the last six months, or 375% in the last three years.  Perhaps the industry would be better off if it listened to Sith Lord-branded research houses and not those that defend Ponzinomics by saying it’s all misunderstood.

Considering the firm and steady increment of ETH prices over the last few weeks, more could be at stake. In a series of screenshots shared on July 3 on Reddit, one trader on GMX has been aggressively “shorting” Ethereum with high leverage, a decision that has seen the trader lose hundreds of thousands in USD. GMX is a popular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to trade perpetual futures contracts, including those of ETH, with up to 50x leverage. Ethereum Prices Up 20% In 2 Weeks Despite facing significant losses from the forced liquidation of their shorts, the trader appears unfazed and continues to double down, shorting with high leverage without concern. Since mid-June 2023, Ethereum prices have been rising, expanding 20% at spot rates. Floating above previous liquidation levels at around $1,900, the coin is now trading at about $1,945.Although buyers were unable to drive up spot rates further, the bulls are still in charge. The psychological price point of $2,000 is still the immediate resistance level, along with the April 2023 highs at $2,100. Sparked by fundamental activities and mostly confidence from the broader cryptocurrency community, Ethereum has been marching higher, tracking the performance of Bitcoin.

The SEC’s representatives, especially its chair, Gary Gensler, have remained non-committal in readily classifying the status of ETH. Any clarification could boost prices or force a sell-off depending on the agency’s classification. Trader’s Doubling Down on ETH Shorts Despite the steady rise of ETH over the past two weeks, the trader, records reveal, has been shorting ETH from when it was at around $1,700 to spot rates. However, the trader began aggressively shorting ETH from June 26. In total, the trader opened two positions. One with a leverage of 19X was for $12 million, while the other with a leverage of 7X was for $1 million. As prices increased, the collateral representing $12 million from the 19X leverage position was closed. This didn’t stop the trader from opening another position. According to his trading history, another short position with a stop at $1,999 was opened, with leverage of 30X.

All that’s evident is that the coin’s price has been firm, defying sellers who have been active from mid-April through to the first half of June. In the medium term, the $2,000 and $2,100 liquidation levels are critical price points that could shape ETH’s trajectory in the second half of 2023.

14519285,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541176,1688515223,SSV Network Unveils Plan For Decentralized ETH Staking Infrastructure,"The ssv.network has finally announced the launch of its mainnet, bringing a decentralized Ethereum (ETH) staking infrastructure to the Ethereum network. The launch follows more than two years of testing and refining, and the network is poised to revolutionize the staking industry. SSV Network’s Decentralized Infrastructure The ssv.network’s mainnet rollout plan includes four phases, each with its goals and provisions. The first phase, beginning in early Q2 2023, ensures that all mainnet parameters are correctly configured. The second phase will introduce a complete set of verified operators, while the third phase will introduce builders utilizing the ssv.network infrastructure. Finally, the fourth phase will be the permissionless launch, inviting anyone to use the open protocol to build or stake. Related Reading: TRX Bulls Charge Ahead As Tron Network Prepares For Major Upgrade According to the announcement, the phased approach to the rollout is necessary to ensure that all the various actors and stakeholders in the network are aligned. But what are the benefits of this for the future of ETH staking? Decentralization: The ssv.network is a decentralized and permissionless network that aligns with the core principles of Ethereum. By embracing this vision, the network aims to bolster Ethereum’s resilience and empower the community to shape the future of staking. Fault tolerance: The ssv.network has been built to tackle fundamental Ethereum validator challenges, including fault tolerance. The network is designed to be resilient and able to handle failures in a decentralized manner. Security: The ssv.network has been designed to be secure, with multiple layers of security protocols to ensure the network is safe from attacks. Zero-coordination: The ssv.network has been designed to be a zero-coordination network, meaning that validators do not need to coordinate to validate blocks. Instead, the network uses a mesh-like structure that allows validators to validate blocks independently. Using the ssv.network for staking ETH provides a secure, resilient, and decentralized way to participate in the Ethereum network. The network’s focus on fault tolerance, security, zero-coordination, diversity, and its self-sustaining ecosystem, makes it an attractive option for anyone looking to stake ETH in the future. Shanghai Hardfork Sparks Surge In ETH Staking Deposits The recent implementation of the Shanghai hard fork has resulted in a surge in Ethereum staking deposits, according to analytics firm Glassnode. The hard fork, activated on June 2nd, introduced several changes to the Ethereum network, including updates to the gas fee structure and EIP-1559. This new transaction fee mechanism aims to improve the user experience by reducing transaction fees and improving predictability. Glassnode’s data shows that deposit activity for staking ETH peaked on June 2nd, with over 13,595 new deposits worth over 408,000 ETH. This surge in staking deposits suggests that investors and users are gaining confidence in Ethereum’s flexibility following the implementation of the hard fork. Staking allows users to earn rewards by holding and validating transactions on the network, and the recent surge in deposits indicates that more users are becoming interested in this process to participate in the network and earn passive income. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here? In contrast to staking deposits, ETH exchange deposit transactions remained flat at around 30,000 during the same period. This suggests that investors and users choose to hold and stake their ETH rather than trade or sell it on exchanges. This is a positive sign for the Ethereum network, as staking provides a more stable and secure way to participate, compared to trading on exchanges, which can be subject to market volatility. As of the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,948, struggling to break through the upper resistance level of $1,990. Over the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a pullback, and ETH has declined by 0.8%.
