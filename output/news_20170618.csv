42400036,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzT5J,1497783654,Banking and Blockchain: Why We Need an AML/KYC Safe Harbor,"Steven Hopkins is chief operating officer and general counsel of Medici Ventures, an Overstock subsidiary focused on the advancement of blockchain technology.  In this opinion piece, Hopkins discusses issues with the global AML and KYC requirements placed on banks, concluding that, while this is encouraging blockchain innovation, more legal clarity is needed to prevent developing countries being largely excluded from the financial system.      In 1970, legislators supporting the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) emphasized that the new law would not be a burden to financial institutions because they already kept most of the records required and the Secretary of the Treasury would have broad latitude to provide exemptions in cases where regulatory costs exceeded benefits.  Since then, each of the 11 additional laws has added more requirements for banks and money transmitters. Today, this compendium of regulation is generally referred to as the anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) rules.  In addition to reporting transactions above certain levels, banks are now required to know who their customers are, and to report any 'suspicious activity'. Ask any financial institution today what its largest burden is, the answer is invariably ""compliance"".  Uncertainty and de-risking  Regulatory burdens on financial institutions are expensive, and growing bank fees and service charges have reflected this. However, after the financial crisis of 2008, regulators added uncertainty to the mix.  They began to use the broad authority granted them by Congress to impose large fines, levying $321bn in penalties on banks between 2009 and 2016. The perceived randomness of who might be fined next and how much, added enormous uncertainty to the world of banking.  In addition to the financial impact of nine- and 10-figure fines, being singled out as a supporter of terrorism and organized crime carries an enormous reputational risk for any company.  Banks got the message. Their response was to sever ties with virtually any foreign correspondent bank with customers that regulators might deem 'suspicious' using 20/20 hindsight.  They are also careful not do business with customers or industries that might later turn out to be 'suspicious'. It’s a rational course of action with devastating results.  De-risking and its human cost  The amount of de-risking activity has been significant. Accuity, a banking industry research group, found in May 2017 that 25% of global correspondent banking ties have been severed since 2009.  Businesses dealing with cryptocurrency and legal marijuana have had accounts closed and been refused banking services pursuant to a practice labeled 'pre-risking' by bank executives. Certain regions such as Africa and the Caribbean have been hit hardest, with nearly 70% of Caribbean banks reporting severance of correspondent banking relationships by 2015.  A separate study published by the Charity and Security Network in February 2017, found 66% of charities and non-profits experiencing obstacles such as payment delays, additional due diligence requirements and fee increases.  Fully 16% of charities surveyed said they had experienced account closures or a refusal to open accounts.  Regional economies have been deeply affected, with exporters unable to engage in trade finance and individuals who rely on remittance payments from relatives unable to receive them. Even with worldwide economic growth during 2015 and 2016, remittance payments to developing nations declined two years running – the only double decline in recent memory according to the World Bank.  The economic impacts of de-risking have been so severe that several Caribbean central banks have begun working with bitcoin-based payments company Bitt in order to create an alternative currency settlement network in the Caribbean.  Bitt founder and CEO Gabriel Abed has been a passionate critic of de-risking and emphasized at the Medici Ventures Blockchain Summit recently that, for the already impoverished citizens of the Caribbean, de-risking is exceptionally painful.  After noting the myriad of very high costs in making a simple transaction, Abed summed it up by saying simply:  ""It is expensive to be poor.""  Re-risking  By forcing millions out of the financial system, de-risking is creating a large population that has no other alternative but to use gray market or illicit means to make payments, move money or otherwise participate in the economy.  Henry Balani of Accuity notes, ""[R]egulation designed to protect the global financial system is, in a sense, having the opposite effect and forcing whole regions outside the regulated financial system.""  This marginalization of millions has helped many see the benefits of blockchains, cryptocurrencies and other methods that do not require significant interaction with the global financial system. Without access to traditional banks, Caribbean governments are finding no other way to ensure that their citizens will have access to payment and banking infrastructure.  With so many pushed out of the system, financial inclusion has become more than a nicety. As Paul Taylor and Juan Martinez of Swift put it in a recent article, financial inclusion is now a necessity that ""needs to remain front and center, not only because it is essential to society, but also as a means of minimizing illicit flows"".  Financial inclusion and safe harbor  The obvious solution to this humanitarian and law enforcement problem is to find a way to bring 'de-risked' areas, industries and individuals back into the financial system. Cryptocurrency money transmission businesses are eager to provide solutions for the de-risked at much lower costs than traditional banks, but cannot easily obtain banking relationships.  Banks remain uncertain as to whether they will be rewarded or punished for financial inclusion efforts. All parties want to know that they are operating within the law. With this background, no financial institution or money transmission business will risk doing business with industries, individuals or regions that have been 'de-risked' until there is a safe harbor regulation.  The US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has attempted several times in the past two years to state that its regulations are clear and do not require banks to sever correspondent banking relationships. The empirical results show that this is simply not true. De-risking continues apace.  The only thing that is clear today is that banks do not know how to comply with the regulations so they err on the side of caution.  A 'bright line' rule with reasonable requirements and a safe harbor is the only thing that will reverse the disturbing trend of de-risking. Legislators passing the Bank Secrecy Act assured us the law wouldn’t be a burden.  Let's go back to that sentiment and give financial institutions a way to be sure they have fully complied with AML/KYC rules.  Disclosure: Medici Ventures is an investor in Bitt.

42400058,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzTL3,1497780017,Blockchain in France: A Primer on an Emerging Market,"Alexandre Stachtchenko is president of blockchain association La Chaintech and the co-founder of Blockchain Partner, a firm created by the merger of two French startups: Blockchain France and Labo Blockchain. Blockchain Partner offers blockchain consultation services in France.      In this opinion piece, Stachtchenko provides an in depth overview of the blossoming blockchain scene in France, arguing that now is the time to take official engagement in the tech to the next level.      How well does France perform in the blockchain field? It is an interesting question to raise when speaking about the country that represented the third biggest world presence at the CES 2017 in Las Vegas, just behind the US and China, and the second in terms of startups.      This article aims to present a quick panorama of the French blockchain situation.    Public authorities: Between consultation and experimentation    As of today, the French government has shown some interest in the technology, without yet having launched major initiatives in that field. Its main initiative was taken in March 2016 by the Ministry of Economy, when a decree was passed, based on crowdfunding laws, to allow debt-based instruments (mini-bonds) to be issued on a blockchain. If this first step is a success, the ministry envisaged ""introducing this type of regulatory framework, for example, for unlisted securities”.      Several banks have already communicated some positivity around related projects, such as BNP Paribas along with the startup Smart Angels.      On the parliamentary level, an entire day dedicated to blockchain technology was organized in March 2016 at the National Assembly, with the participation of French blockchain startups (such as Blockchain Partner, Stratumn and Paymium), large companies (such as AXA and La Poste) and universities, researchers and public authorities. This was followed by another parliamentary forum in October 2016.      More recently, the Public Treasury has launched a public consultation to gather ideas on how to boost blockchain development in France. In May 2017, France Stratégie, the French Prime Minister’s cabinet for national strategies analysis, held several hearings on blockchain issues such as legal and social issues or regulations.      Similarly, several public institutions have started to take initiatives around the tech. For example, the French central bank has been working on an interbank proof-of-concept with the assistance of Blockchain Partner since last year. It also launched a Lab for blockchain startups last February.      La Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, a French public financial institution, has also launched a workgroup called LabChain to conduct experimentations with large companies such as BNP Paribas, AXA, etc, alongside a number of blockchain startups.      More recently, Finance Innovation, a French institution dedicated to fostering the French financial sector, is setting up a working group to guide the government over initiatives they will need to lead in the blockchain sector.      However, knowing that blockchain is still immature and complex, the legal status of blockchain technology is still open for debate. To tackle this issue, working groups have been launched with the participation of public authorities and lawyers.      Even though France has taken some initiatives concerning blockchain, its actions are still somewhat timid. I would argue that it is now time to go beyond organizing conferences and workshops. For instance, French authorities could set up real experimentations, as has been happening in many other countries.      There are many potential use cases for the technology being worked on elsewhere, from electronic voting secured on blockchain (Australia), to traceability of welfare spending (the UK), or land registry (Sweden and Georgia) and healthcare systems (US and Estonia).    The French ecosystem: Relatively small but dynamic and ambitious    Some large French companies have seen the threats and opportunities of blockchain and as a result have started experimenting with the technology to avoid being left behind.      As in the rest of the world, the first companies that have launched initiatives are the large banks, such as BNP Paribas, which has launched several proofs-of-concept (PoCs): for instance, an inter-company 'immediate' payment service, or the crowdfunding project mentioned above.      Other banks have joined the R3 banking blockchain consortium, including Société Générale, RCI Bank & Services and Natixis.      Meanwhile, some of the large financial institutions and the 'Big Four' auditing and consulting firms have created internal divisions to better understand and use blockchain technologies. Companies from other sectors are slowly building awareness around blockchain technology, and are starting to dig into it, for example SNCF (transport), Carrefour (retail) and Total (energy).      The French blockchain startup ecosystem is of medium size compared with leading nations, but is dynamic and blossoming, with several startups eager to take on the world.      Apart from Blockchain Partner, one of the most famous is Ledger, which raised €7m in March 2017, and is known for the quality and security of its hardware wallets.      Stratumn, which also raised €7m in May 2017, is another example of a well-known startup. The firm offers a platform for developing enterprise-level blockchain applications. Acinq is also a rising star in the international blockchain scene. A pioneer of Lightning Network implementations, its Eclair project attempts to tackle bitcoin's scaling issue.      More recently, iEx.ec, a startup focusing on distributed computing for 'dapps' (decentralized applications), raised more than €12m in less than three hours through an initial coin offering, or ICO. And there are many more companies, less known but also showing promise, such as Ledgys, Woleet and so on.      This crowd of startups is aware that to be stronger they need to work together. To that end, they have started meeting up and uniting in associations.    Blockchain associations: Collaboration and debate    French startups collaborate in associations to defend their interest and make their voice heard by public authorities.      The general impression is that, for the moment, only big players such as banks or main financial institutions are giving their opinion to the regulators and public institutions, mostly focused on consortium blockchains. In this context, startups' ideas and issues need to be listened to and dealt with, to ensure that an overall sound legal and public environment will be developed for blockchain technologies.      The biggest association is Chaintech (a wink to the 'Frenchtech' label created by the government) with more than 120 members, representing around 20 startups, including Blockchain Partner, Ledger, Stratumn, Ledgys, Woleet, Belem, Bity, etc.      Chaintech aims at ""promoting visibility and synergy of French speaking blockchain actors, and give them a common institutional voice"". It organizes and participates in meetings, conferences and hackathons (such as Le BlockFest 1.0, held in 2016 – a founding moment for Chaintech).      In addition, there are Le Cercle du Coin (a pioneer association in France, historically more focused on bitcoin) and Asseth (focused on ethereum). Less formal is the CryptoFR community, organized around a forum and a Slack group with more than 1500 people.      This landscape is boosted by numerous passionate and specialist individuals, mainly emanating from the bitcoin and ethereum communities.    How are schools and universities reacting?    ESILV, a French engineering school, was one of the first academic institutions in the world to show its interest in blockchain technology by certifying student diplomas on bitcoin at the beginning of 2016.      The school has also been integrating blockchain in its curriculum. As early as September 2015, students were already being offered a course on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in order to understand how blockchain technologies work under the hood.      Furthermore, the department of financial engineering launched, in September 2016, a fintech major which includes courses on cryptography, payment systems, blockchain and the history of currencies until bitcoin. ECE, another engineering school in Paris, is also quite active, thanks to its numerous alumni working in blockchain startups or projects.      However, these kinds of initiatives are still rare and France needs more universities to take on the subject.      Awareness is rising, though. In March 2017, ESCP Europe, a business school, held the first conference on French blockchain academic research in partnership with Blockchain Partner and the Ministry of Economy.      While there are still few big actors or large-scale public initiatives, the French blockchain community is very active, thanks to the associations that federate the ecosystem, and public authorities are slowly building awareness of the subject.      All the conditions are being met for France to become a major actor in the international blockchain scene, and the future looks very promising.
