42398979,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpib,1460065019,Bitcoin Browser Brave Draws Fire from Major News Publishers,"The maker of ad-blocking browser Brave, which plans to give users the option to view ads in exchange for micropayments in bitcoin, has responded to a cease-and-desist letter it received today from members of a major newspaper trade group.  Seventeen members of the Newspaper Association of America (NAA), including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal, sent the letter to Brave, calling the business plan proposed for the browser ""blatantly illegal"".  The letter states:  “Your plan to use our content to sell your advertising is indistinguishable from a plan to steal our content to publish on your own website.”  Under Brave’s business model, publishers are given 55% of ad-revenue, with 15% apiece given to third-party advertising partners, ad viewers, and Brave itself. The team behind Brave, which includes Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich, has raised $2.5m to date.  The letter, a full copy of which was obtained by Business Insider, states that the newspapers would hold Brave liable for breach of contract and unfair competition, among other items.  ""By engaging in Brave’s plan of advertising replacement, Brave is liable for breach of contract, unauthorized access to our websites, unfair competition, and other causes of action,"" the letter states.  CoinDesk has obtained Brave’s response to the NAA’s cease-and-desist letter, reproduced in its entirety below:    ""The NAA sent a letter to Brave Software that is filled with false assertions. The NAA has fundamentally misunderstood Brave. Brave is the solution, not the enemy.      The NAA's letter to Brave Software asserts that any browser that blocks and replaces ads on the browser user's device performs ""unauthorized republication"" of Web content. This is false on its face, since browsers do not ""republish"", serve, syndicate, or distribute content across the Internet or to any computer other than the one on which they run.    Browsers are the end-point for secure connections, the user agent that actually mediates and combines all the pieces of content, including third-party ads and first-party publisher news stories. Browsers can block, rearrange, mash-up and otherwise make use of any content from any source. If it were the case that Brave's browsers perform ""republication"", then so too does Safari's Reader mode, and the same goes for any ad-blocker-equipped browser, or the Links text-only browser, or screen readers for the visually impaired.    The NAA letter also falsely asserts that Brave will share an ""unspecified percentage of revenue"", when our revenue share pie chart has been public and fixed from our first preview release in January. We give the lion's share (pun intended), to websites. With our ad-share model, the default money flow directs up to 70% of ad revenue to site publishers – far greater than the average percentage in the current programmatic display ad ecosystem. Brave keeps 15%, and allows the end-user to choose whether to donate or keep their 15% share. Keeping their share still results in 55% ad rev share to site owners – beating the current average of 40%.    We sympathize with publishers concerned about the damage that pure ad blockers do to their ability to pay their bills via advertising revenue. However, this problem long pre-dates Brave. We categorically reject the claim that browsers perform ""republication"", and we repeat that Brave has a sound and systematic plan to financially reward publishers. We aim to outperform the invasive third-party ads that we block, with our better, fewer, and privacy-preserving ads.    Finally, we note that malvertisement has gotten onto the websites of the New York Times and the BBC recently through the ill-designed, unregulated, and poorly-delegated third-party advertising technology ecosystem. Truly, this tracker-based ad-tech ecosystem is what is damaging the brand value of content publishers and driving users to adopt ad-blocking software. Brave blocks and replaces only third-party ads and trackers. Our system thus actually repairs the damage that publishers have carelessly allowed their ad partners (and partners' partners, to the seventh degree of separation) do to their trademarked brands and names.    Make no mistake: this NAA letter is the first shot in a war on all ad-blockers, not just on Brave. Though the NAA never reached out to us, we would be happy to sit down with them for an opportunity to discuss how the Brave solution can be a win win. We will fight alongside all citizens of the Internet who deserve and demand a better deal than they are getting from today's increasingly abusive approach to Web advertising.""

42398991,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpsR,1460060510,Intel Unveils 'Sawtooth Lake' Proposal at Hyperledger Meeting,"Tech giant Intel has unveiled a new experimental distributed ledger platform dubbed ""Sawtooth Lake"".  Code for proposed contribution to the open-source Hyperledger blockchain project was posted to GitHub today, along with an in-depth informational releasehttp://intelledger.github.io/introduction.html that outlines the major planks of the initiative and offers a tutorial for implementing the code. The code was presented at today's Hyperledger technical steering committee meeting.  Intel described Sawtooth Lake as ""a highly modular platform for building, deploying and running distributed ledgers"".  According to the company, what is currently available are the elements needed to construct a “fully functional” digital asset exchange – a possible allusion to an earlier project unveiled by Intel in February.  At the time, Intel demonstrated a fantasy sports marketplace game built using a blockchain during a Hyperledger meeting. Under that project, users would exchange digitized shares in sports teams and seek to accrue the highest amount of a virtual currency called “mikkels”.  The company explained:  ""In Sawtooth Lake, the data model and transaction language are implemented in a ‘transaction family’. While we expect users to build custom transaction families that reflect the unique requirements of their ledgers, we provide three transaction families that are sufficient for building, testing and deploying a marketplace for digital assets.""  Prior to its participation in the Hyperledger project, Intel notably worked on bitcoin mining chips developed for Silicon Valley bitcoin startup 21 Inc.  Twin consensus algorithms  Intel says that its proposed platform uses two methods of establishing consensus – one inspired by bitcoin, and the other related to the methods by which the Ripple and Stellar networks operate.  The company explained:  ""The first, called PoET for 'Proof of Elapsed Time', is a lottery protocol that builds on trusted execution environments (TEEs) provided by Intel’s [Secure Guard Extensions] to address the needs of large populations of participants. The second, Quorum Voting, is an adaptation of the Ripple and Stellar consensus protocols and serves to address the needs of applications that require immediate transaction finality.”  The firm indicated that, according to its data, the system is capable of scaling ""to thousands of participants"".  However, Intel warned prospective testers that the platform, as it exists today, remains experimental. As such, Intel cautioned users against launching sensitive applications on the technology.  The proposal adds to the growing body of contributions made thus far by Hyperledger participants. Code IBM, Digital Asset Holdings and Blockstream, as well as a proposal from JPMorgan Chase, have been presented in recent weeks.  To date, 40 members have joined the ranks of the project.  Intel declined to provide further comment on the proposal.

42398990,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhptQ,1460058209,"Rise of Internet Enables Bitcoin to Compete With Fiat, Researchers Find","A new research paper co-authored by an economics advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia explores whether private currencies, such as digital currencies like bitcoin, can compete with government-issued alternatives.  ""Can competition among privately issued fiat currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum work?"" the paper, published on 3rd April, asks. ""Only sometimes. To show this, we build a model of competition among privately issued fiat currencies.""  The paper, co-authored by Jesús Fernández-Villaverde of the University of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia Fed researcher Daniel Sanches, seeks to unpack how private forms of money, including digital currencies, interact with one another in terms of price stability.  Among the notable arguments is that the rise of the Internet has resulted in an environment in which private monies like bitcoin can competitively emerge.  ""Our model highlights how the issuing of a private currency is logically separated from banking. Both tasks were historically linked for logistical reasons: banks had a central location in the network of payments that made it easy for them to introduce currency in circulation,"" the paper states, adding:  ""We will argue that the Internet has broken the logistical barrier.""

42398980,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpja,1460046058,9 Big Takeaways from R3's New Distributed Ledger Debut,"Following a flurry of announcements that mostly highlighted how it was working with its partner banks on trials of existing blockchain systems, consortium startup R3CEV took steps to highlight its in-house technology development this week.  In a lengthy post published on both his personal blog and R3’s website, chief technology officer Richard Gendal Brown gave new details about the startup's thinking on the ecosystem, and most notably, why it is seeking a different approach with the blockchain-inspired technology it is building.  Of note was that Brown spoke out against what he said was an idea he admitted he had long championed – that blockchain-based systems could prove to be widely applicable solutions for business problems in the financial services sector.  Brown went so far as to call blockchains ""inappropriate"" for many banking scenarios, in remarks that were heavily deferential to the ecosystem’s early innovators, including bitcoin and Ethereum.  Such platforms, Brown reasoned, have emerged as novel solutions to ""business problems"", but he stressed that the financial services industry does not necessarily have the same problems that these technologies were designed to solve.  At a high level, the statements add up to what can be viewed as a mission statement from R3, one that positions the startup as more than a consortium effort between 43 major banks, but as a driver of technology in the space.  The statements also included the announcement of Corda, a new distributed ledger platform for which Brown provided the first details.  Here are the biggest takeaways and most interesting hints about what could come next from the R3 lab:  1. R3 believes more than blockchain is needed to solve bank problems  Early on in the post, Brown asserts that “blockchain” has become a term that is disassociated from its technological meaning.  In his description of Corda, Brown labels the technology a ""distributed ledger platform"", a term that has long been associated with its technology (and that of Ripple), but that has perhaps been more strongly associated with the latter company.  Still, Brown looks to distance R3 from this terminology, and emphasize his conclusion that “blockchain” solutions aren’t going to broadly solve financial industry issues:  ""Corda is a distributed ledger platform designed from the ground up to record, manage and synchronize financial agreements between regulated financial institutions. It is heavily inspired by and captures the benefits of blockchain systems, without the design choices that make blockchains inappropriate for many banking scenarios.""  Brown’s reasoning for the argument is that he feels this line of thinking is akin to applying technology to ""arbitrary problems"".  ""Every successful project I’ve worked on started with the requirements, not some cool piece of technology, and I was determined to bring that discipline into our work at R3,"" he writes.  Brown goes on to state that he believes the reason blockchain is important in the equation of this larger problem is ""extremely subtle"", and one that is recognized in the architecture of the Corda platform.  The post also included a harsh critique of platforms that are not questioning why blockchains are needed to solve financial business problems, stating:  ""If you don’t have bitcoin’s business problem then be very wary of those trying to sell you something that looks like a bitcoin solution.""  2. Corda uses blockchain, but is not a blockchain  Though details about Corda’s architecture were kept broad, Brown indicated that it uses blockchain as part of a broader package.  He describes Corda as tailor-made for financial agreements.  ""Our starting point is individual agreements between firms (‘state objects’, governed by ‘contract code’ and associated ‘legal prose’),"" he writes.  In particular, he said that Corda will use blockchain technology in an effort to show that “two valid, but conflicting, transactions” cannot be present in the system.  Brown writes:  ""We also recognize that different scenarios require different tradeoffs. So Corda’s design allows for a range of ‘uniqueness service’ implementations, one of which is a ‘traditional blockchain’.""  Implicit in the statement is that there will be other options that may solve this problem, however, and that blockchain would be just one solution among a larger tool-set.  3. R3 has new definition for blockchain  Brown also spent a significant portion of the post questioning the basic properties of blockchains, ultimately concluding that blockchain platforms like Ethereum and bitcoin offer five kinds of services.  This observation, Brown asserts, enabled R3 to take an analytical approach to thinking about how to tweak these basic properties for the needs of financial institutions.  ""The right approach is to treat them as a menu from which to select and customise… different combinations, in different flavours, for different business problems,"" he wrote.  The five properties are consensus, validity, uniqueness, immutability and authentication. For each, Brown provided a basic definition, later elaborating on the specific ways that Corda is treating each in its design.  In his definitions, Brown challenged the idea that consensus systems need to be open to worldwide participation, as in bitcoin, arguing that the network works this way because the business problem it tried to solve could be articulated as ‘How do I create a system where nobody can stop me spending my own money?’  Further, he challenged basic assumptions about how immutability in distributed ledger systems should be defined, while providing high-level overviews of each property.  4. The financial industry’s problem is shared facts  If Brown spoke at length about how the financial industry is not looking to solve the same problems as bitcoin, he also defined what he believes to be the underlying problem that R3, and by extension, the wider industry, should be trying to attack.  The emphasis, according to Brown, should be on achieving consensus about the state of deals between individual financial firms. To achieve this, he argues Corda needed to create a digital link between “human-language prose documents” and smart contract code.  Brown writes:  ""The financial industry is pretty much defined by the agreements that exist between its firms and these firms share a common problem: the agreement is typically recorded by both parties, in different systems and very large amounts of cost are caused by the need to fix things when these different systems end up believing different things.""  In this way, Brown defined Corda as an attempt to use a network to ensure that all parties in a transaction “see the same thing” and know that others who need to know this truth can recognize it.  He went on to write that it is also important for those involved in such deals to specify upfront how agreements are made and how disputes can be resolved, adding:  ""We take into the account the reality of managing financial agreements; we need more than just a consensus system. We need to make it easy to write business logic and integrate with existing code; we need to focus on interoperability. And we need to support the choreography between firms as they build up their agreements.""  5. Corda’s big-picture details have emerged  Though there was no white paper or code released on Corda, Brown did provide a high-level overview of how the distributed ledger system will be built based on the properties of blockchain systems he detailed earlier in the post.  For example, he said Corda would seek to achieve consensus only between parties to deals, not all participants – a design element he categorized as different than public blockchains.  ""This does not mean that a third party down the road also needs to see it,"" he wrote.  As for validity, Corda, he said, lets users write ""validation logic"" in ""time-tested, industry-standard tools"".  ""We define who needs to be in agreement on a transaction’s validity on a contract-by-contract basis,"" he continued.  Notably, he said that Corda’s design has the most in common with existing blockchain platforms on elements such as immutability and authentication.  ""Our data structures are immutable and our building block is the exchange of digitally-signed transactions,"" he notes.  Though, he continued to stress that it differs through attempts to select a set of validators confirming deals on the network, and that not all validators would take part in this process.  The design is perhaps not surprising given that R3 has long argued publicly that bitcoin’s globally distributed network of transaction validators, while working for bitcoin and its goals, is ill-suited to the needs of financial incumbents.  6. Corda has no native cryptocurrency  Consistent with its past descriptions as a ""fabric"", Brown indicated that Corda does not use its own digital asset or cryptocurrency.  Of note is the modifier ""native"", which suggests that Corda may support the use of other digital assets or cryptocurrencies.  Brown wrote that Corda would support a “variety of consensus mechanisms"" a further hint that some digital tokens may present or allowed to be used in its ledger system.  7. R3 has bitcoin on the mind  Perhaps the most interesting takeaway from the piece given R3’s market positioning was Brown’s clear deference to bitcoin’s architecture, which he termed a “marvel”.  ""Its interlocking components are one of those rare examples of something so elegant that they seem obvious in hindsight, yet which required a rare genius to create,"" he wrote.  Brown even characterized bitcoin as a solution to a “business problem”, albeit one he suggested isn’t one shared by major financial institutions or that they would perhaps even articulate as a business problem.  In this light, Brown discussed bitcoin’s use of a blockchain as a product of its goals, a similar logic that he used to speak out about why this type of architecture might not be needed to solve issues major financial institutions are experiencing.  Notably, former bitcoin developer Mike Hearn is also leading the effort on Corda, serving as its lead platform engineer.  8. Regulators are included in the Corda ledger  Brown indicated that Corda is also being designed to accommodate global regulators who may want insight into the transactions occurring within distributed ledger frameworks.  “Corda’s design directly enables regulatory and supervisory observer nodes,” Brown indicated early on in the text.  Later, he returns to this idea, noting that financial institutions using Corda will be able to know that their counterparties and regulators have received any information they can view.  9. Corda doesn’t compete with other blockchains  Despite spending a length of time describing how Corda is similar and dissimilar from other systems, Brown sought to frame it as unique.  The positioning found Brown offering praise for the innovation ongoing in the distributed ledger and blockchain space as a whole, even if he expressed a disdain for firms that were perhaps approaching the industry opportunistically.  Brown said that he as been “deeply impressed” by engineering solutions from other providers, and that R3 will continue to pursue projects that showcase the benefits or shortcomings of these systems in order to provide market information.  “Corda does not seek to compete with or overlap with what other firms are doing: indeed, we are building it because no other platform out there seeks to solve the problems we’re addressing,” he wrote.  He concluded:  ""Different solutions for different problems is our mantra.""

42398984,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpoV,1460039201,7 Wall Street Firms Test Blockchain for Credit Default Swaps,"Seven firms representing various stakeholders in the credit default swaps trading process today announced they successfully tested replicating the process using blockchain technology.  The announcement is the latest that signals an acceleration of the rate at which financial incumbents are embracing both blockchain technology and distributed ledgers.  In a statement, Chris Childs, CEO of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) OTC derivatives segment, said the test’s diverse group of partners was fundamental to its success.  Childs said:  ""Blockchain and distributed ledger technology has the potential to revolutionize highly manual, complex processes across global financial markets. This test reinforces that collaboration among service providers will be critical to ensuring the technology is harnessed.""  Other test members included financial institutions, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan; financial information company Markit, and distributed ledger specialists Axoni.  The test announced today began in early March and included 85 structured test cases to asses the network’s functionality, resiliency and data privacy.  According to the statement, the implementation achieved a 100% success rate across the tests.  The tests  For the test, Markit generated smart contracts from credit default swap trade confirmations, including the economic terms of the deal and permissions management into a blockchain-based system.  The companies did not disclose which blockchain or ledger systems were used as part of the trial, though only a few firms currently offer support for smart contracts, with Symbiont and Ethereum being perhaps the most notable.  According to the statement, the test showed that regulators could view in ""real time"" a wide range of financial events including trade details, counterparty risk metrics, and exposure to reference entities.  “Our experiments with Axoni demonstrate that confidentiality and privacy can be preserved between bilateral parties on an immutable distributed ledger at scale,"" said Emmanuel Aidoo, who is in charge of the blockchain and distributed ledgers at Credit Suisse, in a statement.  Over the course of the months-long project, the group said it built its network using Axoni-hosted software that was installed locally.  Rising frequency of blockchain work  The work comes on the heels of the DTCC's news last week that it would partner with industry startup Digital Asset Holdings on a trial centered on using blockchain tech as part of the repo trading process.  Further, the DTCC’s counterpart in London, ICAP, recently announced it had completed a post-trade blockchain trial of its own, a test that was conducted in partnership with Axoni.  Big announcements have been equally frequent from startups seeking to provide technology solutions on which financial institutions can build.  For example, banking consortium R3CEV announced it was working on its own distributed ledger called Corda, which is inspired by blockchain characteristics, but modified to meet demands unique to the financial industry.
