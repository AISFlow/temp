42383805,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ykVL,1590528600,"Private Firms Can Boost Central Bank Digital Currencies, IMF Official Says","A senior figure at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes a digital currency backed by a central bank would open the door to much greater innovation in retail payments.      Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli, the IMF's deputy division chief in the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said synthetic CBDCs – digital currencies backed by the liabilities of a central bank, but issued with the aid of a private entity – could provide citizens with a reliable means of payment that simultaneously leverage some of the key competitive advantages of the private sector.      A synthetic CBDC as outlined by Mancini-Griffoli is pretty much a public-private partnership. The idea is a licensed eMoney provider stores client funds in a central bank and, in return, receives a central bank liability they can package however they see fit into a publicly tradeable stablecoin that remains fully-backed by central bank reserves.      Speaking Tuesday morning on The Money Movement, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire's new Youtube series, Mancini-Griffoli argued the key benefit offered by a synthetic CBDC, compared to a traditional CBDC – namely, where the central bank is responsible for the entire running of a digital currency – was that it made space for innovation.      Synthetic CBDCs – focusing on retail payments – enable central banks to promote monetary innovation within the confines of a safe and well-regulated environment, he said. In contrast, the traditional idea of a CBDC – which had pretty much ""gone out of the door"" in Mancini-Griffoli's opinion – could become ""very costly and very risky to the central bank, and it may deter innovation.""      ""This public-private partnership [of a synthetic CBDC] is intended to conserve the competitive advantages of the private sector: to interface with clients and innovate, and the comparative advantage of the central bank: to regulate and provide trust,"" he said.      See also: Central Banks Mull Creating a CBDC, but Not on a Blockchain: Survey      Other central banks have also mooted the possibility of a role for private companies. The Bank of England (BoE) has suggested there could be areas where a private entity would be far better placed to offer its own monetary solution for customers, as opposed to the central bank itself jumping in.      Even China, a major critic of the Facebook-backed Libra initiative, has carved out a role for a select group of private entities, the Agricultural Bank of China, say, as well as Alibaba and Tencent, to help in the issuance of its own digital yuan to Chinese citizens.      But the key aspect of a synthetic CBDC, so far as the IMF sees it, is that it delegates most of the fundamental functions of a CBDC to the private sector.      At the IMF-Swiss National Bank Conference in May 2019, Tobias Adrian, the IMF's director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department – Mancini-Griffoli's boss – said a notable advantage of a synthetic CBDC was it allowed the central bank to focus only on areas where it offers tangible value: namely, regulatory oversight and settlement.      By offering liabilities wholesale, all other functions at which the private sector traditionally excels such as customer management, client screening, even the tech design of the CBDC itself, can effectively be outsourced, Adrian added.      In fact, there would be nothing to stop, under the IMF's interpretation, multiple private companies all issuing digital currencies that are all backed by the same central bank liabilities, and effectively compete with one another.      See also: Sweden’s Central Bank Finally Embraces DLT, but Only in Simulation Mode      Still, there remain some unanswered questions. Chief among them is what the relationship between the public and private sector will ultimately look like. As Mancini-Griffoli highlighted: Would a central bank ensure private entities undertake proper due diligence on clients, and would they provide input on what the tech design of the token itself would look like?      It remains hazy on ""where do you draw the line of what the public sector does and what the private sector does,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/26/private-firms-can-boost-central-bank-digital-currencies-imf-official-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08446c9752146640267600f7cdc8965cb43bcf2f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383820,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ykoD,1590527191,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Can't Stick to $9,000 While Stocks Rally","The equities markets far outpaced cryptocurrencies Tuesday on optimism that economic restrictions put in place to help slow the spread of the coronavirus are easing.      Bitcoin (BTC) poked its head above the $9,000 level briefly during morning trading in New York but fell to below $8,700 on selling. As of 20:35 UTC (4:35 p.m. ET), bitcoin was trading at $8,846, a loss of 1% over 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading below its 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages, a signal of bearish sentiment.      “Bitcoin failed to break higher and has been bouncing off support in the $8,700 region,” said Max Boonen, CEO of cryptocurrency liquidity provider B2C2.      While bitcoin has been trending lower, Tuesday’s big winners are stocks.      The Nikkei 225 in Asia closed trading up 2.2%, with the index hitting a three-month high as Japan ended its pandemic-induced state of emergency measures. The FTSE Eurotop 100 index of Europe’s largest public companies by market cap was also in the green, although up less than a percent. The gain was also attributed to the easing of lockdowns in Europe.      Read More: Paul Tudor Jones: Bitcoin Is Now the Macro Big Bet      In the U.S. the S&P 500 climbed 1.2% on the day, up 4% for the past month.      “It's probably the case that stocks are moving upward in response to increased reopening of the economy, which Wall Street may be taking as a positive sign,” said Danny Kim, head of revenue for exchange aggregator SFOX. “Bitcoin's minor downward movement, on the other hand, probably has more to do with a loss of momentum than anything else.”      Since starting the first week of May in tandem, bitcoin and the S&P 500 have been going in opposite directions.      “Bitcoin is not demonstrating correlation to the equity markets at present, given a lot of the smart money is still sitting in stablecoins, particularly tether,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank. Indeed, stablecoins are on the rise and tether is leading the way with a $9 billion market capitalization, according to its transparency page. The blockchain-based assets, pegged to the U.S. dollar, are helpful for traders to move balances quickly across different exchange platforms.      There is some looming concern bitcoin’s price will keep sliding downward due to changes in mining economics since the May 11 bitcoin halving. The once-in-four-year event for the Bitcoin network dropped daily new bitcoin generated to reward miners from roughly 1,800 to 900 BTC. At Tuesday’s bitcoin prices, that 900 BTC translates to around $8 million per day.      Read More: Iranian President Calls for National Crypto Mining Strategy      Miners will have to sell a lot of that bitcoin for cash, according to Swissquote’s Thomas. “Chinese miners who are still running are barely profitable running old technology. They are surviving due to extremely cheap hydro electricity through the Chinese wet season, but will need to continue selling most of their monthly bitcoin gains to pay their operations expenses,” he said. “This will also start weighing on the market.”      Chinese miners make up about 65% of the total bitcoin mining power, according to data provided by pools and collected by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.      Despite a lower crypto outlook, B2C2’s Boonen says his firm has seen professional traders pick up bitcoin at these prices, possibly because they see a value play. “Against the trend, we have seen light buying of BTC and selling of ETH across our franchise since the weekend,” he told CoinDesk.    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mostly in the red Tuesday. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, lost 2.2% in 24 hours as of 20:35 UTC (4:35 p.m. ET).      The biggest losers in 24-hour trading were ethereum classic (ETC) down 2%, stellar (XLM) slipping 1.4% and iota (IOTA) in the red 1.3%. The few winners on the day include lisk (LSK) gaining 4%, qtum (QTUM) in the green 1% and nem (XEM) climbing less than a percent. All price changes were as of 20:35 UTC (4:35 p.m. ET) Tuesday.      In the commodities sector, oil is up 1%, with the price for a barrel of crude at $34.21 as of press time. Gold experienced heavy selling early in the session, with the yellow metal slipping less than a percent on the day to $1,710 at the close of New York trading.

42383801,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ykRZ,1590517901,"Look to Design, Not Laws, to Protect Privacy in the Surveillance Age","Raullen Chai is the co-founder of IoTeX, a Silicon Valley company building the Internet of Trusted Things with blockchain-powered smart devices that protect privacy.      Cameras, thermostats, virtual assistants and other smart devices are being installed in our homes at a blistering rate – in 2020, a new smart bulb will be installed in the world every second. Even traditionally “dumb” devices such as beds, mirrors and toilets are now being equipped with WiFi and powerful sensors to make them “smart.” Today, the average American owns eight of these smart devices, which communicate back and forth with their owner. But if our devices can talk to us about the status of our homes, who else are they talking to?      Tech giants such as Amazon and Google have a history of abusing our digital data and are now penetrating our physical homes and neighborhoods, making it more important than ever to safeguard our data and identities. These tech giants are on a spending spree, acquiring companies like Ring, Nest and Fitbit giving them an inside look at our homes and bodies. With millions of Ring cameras and Echo speakers watching and listening to us 24/7 in our homes, our data and privacy are in jeopardy.      The COVID-19 pandemic has only heightened the need to ensure people can choose how their data is used. In their zeal to slow the virus’ spread, governments and corporations have too often jumped to centralized solutions without considering the impact on our privacy. They’re doing so through apps that hope to track the spread of the virus using everything from Bluetooth signals to location tracking. We may be willing to temporarily sacrifice our privacy to battle the virus, but how do we return to a pre-pandemic state?    Reactive regulations simply cannot guarantee our privacy.    It’s difficult to rein in relaxed policy and laws once they become normalized, much less consumer technology. Facebook is still a part of billions of people’s lives despite its privacy and data violations, for example. Tech giants are the gatekeepers of our data and the more of it we give up, the more powerful their control over not just what ads we see but the “connections” we are shown, the content we’re suggested and the ways they can shift user behavior.      Data privacy regulations have begun emerging in recent years, but these reactive measures simply cannot guarantee our privacy. We must proactively build and adopt new technologies with “privacy by design” to reach a human-centered future.      “Privacy by design” is the principle that privacy is a “must have” from the initial design stage of every smart device. By building these devices to protect our data, even if a bad actor oversteps the law, we can shift away from heavily relying on regulation as one of the few means of protecting our privacy. In the future, our privacy will be guaranteed at the technological level, which may sound like science fiction but it’s not. New technologies rooted in trust, such as blockchain and secure hardware, are reaching critical milestones that make them ready for broad-based adoption.      Even now, while we have to accept certain restrictions and give up certain civil liberties to save lives during this pandemic, we can fight the health crisis without sacrificing our privacy. The solution lies in technology’s ability to offer data sovereignty that facilitates individuals choosing what data they are willing to share with whom and for how long.    Personal and physical    Digital hacks such as identity theft are bad enough. But when the theft or re-selling of data affects the behavior of physical devices, the results can be irrevocable for the victim. Unlike our virtual selves, our physical selves have no “reset” button when a hacker takes control of an autonomous vehicle zooming down the highway. A data leak is not just your Spotify playlists, it’s security camera footage revealing when you leave your house every morning. A password breach is not just exposing the keys to your email, it’s handing over the keys to your smart home. When it comes to the devices we place in our homes, we must be extremely vigilant. When hacking gets physical and knocks us down, there is no safety net to catch our fall.      See also: Citizen App’s New Contact Tracing Feature Raises Privacy Red Flags      The steady growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) also represents an expansion of attack vectors for hackers. Research from SAM Seamless Network found that home security cameras account for 47% of IoT devices compromised by hackers. Smart hubs and network-attached storage (NAS), which commonly connect to other IoT devices, are the second and third most vulnerable devices, accounting for 15% and 12% of global device hacks, respectively. Rounding out the list of vulnerable devices are household staples like printers and TVs.      The sensitivity of data generated by our smart homes compels us to treat our physical devices differently than our digital apps. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a recorded video or conversation is worth a thousand keystrokes to hackers. Powering our smart homes with trusted, decentralized technologies can not only allow us to keep our data away from centralized tech giants but makes us captains of our own data destinies.    Not your data, not your privacy    The creep of surveillance capitalism into our homes and neighborhoods is threatening the fundamental right to freedom and privacy for individuals, as well as for society as a whole.      Just look at what Google knows about us today: what we browse (Chrome), whom we email (Gmail), where we travel (Maps), what we watch (YouTube), what we read (News), what we buy (Pay) – and this is just a subset of Google’s vast suite of products. Tech giants have already spied or purchased their way into almost every data type imaginable. Now they are coming for the last two pieces of the puzzle, our home and health data. Based on tech giants’ past actions in the digital world, we cannot expect them to kindly ask us to opt-in and share our data. After all, privacy is the single largest existential threat to surveillance capitalists.      New consumer data privacy regulations – most notably the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. –have sparked much needed discussion around “who has my data and what are they doing with it?” However, in practice GDPR and CCPA function more as lengthy operational frameworks that allow us to inquire, complain and seek financial damages from corporations that abuse our data. This does not prevent the abuse in the first place. We need to flip the whole paradigm. After all, shouldn’t we own our own data by default?      Data ownership provides us the freedom to choose whether to keep our data fully private, share it with others or authorize its use by corporations. This is antithetical to today’s centralized models, which operate as data dictatorships, where citizens must ask corporations to delete, transfer, or do anything else with their data. Flipping the model does not mean the services corporations offer today or even the monetization of our data cannot continue. It just means we, the people, will have the ultimate say regarding how our data is used.      Over the past decade we have gradually been coaxed into being complacent with Big Tech holding, manipulating and selling our private data. The only way to reverse this trend is to build and adopt trusted products that protect our data, identity and privacy by default, especially those we put in our homes. The next 10 years will define whether the digital era is owned and controlled by institutions or by the people.

Announced Tuesday, the genesis block of the blockchain-of-blockchains has been mined, according to a blog post from Web3 Foundation, Polkadot’s lead developer.      “This first stage of Polkadot CC1 provides two key things: Claims & attestation and staking,” Polkadot co-founder Gavin Wood wrote in another post. In other words, Polkadot’s governance parameters are being walked out for the first time with limited functionality.      Wood hinted at the impending soft-launch of the interoperability project earlier this month at the Ready Layer One conference.      Read more: ‘Very Near Launch’: Polkadot Founder Gavin Wood Details Network Rollout      An alternative vision for hosting decentralized applications (dapps), Wood began the development of Polkadot in late 2016. Wood also co-founded Ethereum – including writing the network’s yellow paper and its programming language, Solidity – before becoming disenfranchised with that blockchain’s progression toward a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm (an overhaul commonly referred to as Eth 2.0).      “Polkadot CC1 is freshly born; beginning its ‘life’ at 17:36:21, Zug time,” Wood wrote. “We’re now at block #400, with Grandpa and Babe chugging along quite happily. So far so good.”      Polkadot will first launch under a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm controlled by the Web3 Foundation. The network will test out various “Sudo” modules in the same manner as Polkadot’s experimental Kusama network did in 2019 until a chain candidate is selected.      Read more: Web3’s Gavin Wood Launches Kusama Network to Test Polkadot Protocol      Polkadot will then transition to a PoS consensus algorithm with disbursements of the network’s DOT token, the blog states. Following the network’s $145 million token sale in 2017, the Web3 Foundation has prioritized building out integrations with its Substrate custom blockchain protocol along with “parachain” connections to other blockchains such as Chainlink and the Shyft Network.      Read more: Polkadot to Use Chainlink Oracles for Interoperability Network      “Polkadot is, in many respects, the biggest bet in this ecosystem against chain maximalism,” Wood said in a video interview published today. “Even if there were one perfect chain, I don’t think it would stay perfect for very long.

Top Shelf    Libra's New Face A statement announcing the rebranding of Facebook subsidiary Calibra to Novi also reveals details of the anticipated wallet product. The Novi wallet will operate as a standalone app, as well as provide interoperability with Facebook’s social messaging apps Messenger and WhatsApp, to make transactions as “easy as sending a message.” Novi customers will need to be verified using a government-issued ID. The wallet will initially be rolled out to a limited number of countries, though the release date still remains unclear.      'No Such Prohibitions' India’s central bank has clarified the nation’s new crypto policy, months after the Indian Supreme Court lifted restrictions on banking crypto clients. Commercial banks can indeed provide banking services to traders and firms dealing in cryptocurrencies. “As on date, no such prohibition exists,” the Reserve Bank of India said on May 22. The statement came in response to a query filed by BV Harish, co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Unocoin.      Signed Transactions More than 100 addresses Craig Wright – the self-proclaimed inventor of Bitcoin currently being sued for half of his supposed multi-billion dollar stash of the cryptocurrency – claimed to be his were used to sign a message calling Wright a “fraud” and making it plain that he does not in fact own or control them. The Bitcoin addresses were inadvertently entered into the public record in the ongoing case against Wright.      Challenging Amazon In a bid to attract users beyond the cryptoverse, Halsey Minor’s VideoCoin platform will launch Wednesday with fiat payment options. VideoCoin decentralizes the hosting and streaming of video, paying out a native token to participants in the network. “A company like Fox is never going to go to an exchange and buy volatile tokens. You kind of have to be in the crypto world to use crypto projects – and we are trying to break that barrier down,” Minor said.      Tencent's Investments Tencent is investing 500 billion yuan ($70 billion) into “new infrastructure” based on emerging technologies including AI, cloud computing and blockchain over the next five years. The investments are aimed at recovering losses accrued during the coronavirus crisis and “further cement virus containment success,” Tencent’s senior executive vice president Dowson Tong told Guangming Daily.      Bitcoin 401(k) Bitwage has unveiled a trial of a bitcoin 401(k) plan.

Trading Currents Thailand is teaming up with a blockchain firm Power Ledger to encourage peer-to-peer trading of renewable energy. “Blockchain-enabled transactive energy solutions including peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, virtual power plants as well as renewable energy certificates and carbon credits trading will be the key to establishing economically viable renewable energy markets,” said the startup’s co-founder, Jemma Green, and help the nation hit its 25% renewable energy target by 2037.      Strategic Investment India’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, CoinDCX, has secured a $2.5 million strategic investment led by Polychain Capital with support from Coinbase Ventures. The investment will reinforce the exchange’s efforts to drive cryptocurrency adoption in the country after a major legal victory in March.      Telegram Throws in the Towel Telegram is no longer challenging the Securities and Exchange Commission's ban on its blockchain token project in the courtroom. On Friday, the company filed an agreement for dismissal without prejudice of a previous appeal challenging the SEC’s prohibition of distributing gram tokens to U.S. investors.      Supporting Steem? Binance is forced to “technically” support last week’s hard fork of the Steem blockchain, according to the crypto exchange’s CEO. In a statement on Binance’s official blog Sunday, CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said the exchange is “very much against zeroing other people’s assets on the blockchain,” but to not support it would mean that Binance users would not be able to withdraw their steem tokens.      Louisiana Licensing The Louisiana State Senate is about to consider a bill to regulate and license virtual currency businesses. If passed, the legislation would establish Louisiana’s first crypto licensing regime. Crypto businesses would have to apply with the state’s Office of Financial Institutions (OFI), fork over executives’ fingerprints, subject their “experience, character and general fitness” to investigation – and perhaps the business premises as well – and pay a nonrefundable registration fee, among other requirements.    Market Intel    Digitization Boost Messari analysts wrote a report arguing the “coming digitization of money,” including the launch of CBDCs, could provide a “secular tailwind” for bitcoin. The resilience of cryptocurrencies has catalyzed government investigation into CBDCs, which in turn expose the wider population to the mechanics of cryptocurrencies. CBDCs, “will increase people’s comfort with and understanding of cryptocurrencies, get more people creating and using cryptocurrency wallets, and provide on-ramps into decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin,” the analysts said.

42383816,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ykgf,1590509312,"To See Libra's Potential, Look at the Philippines, Not the US","Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm focused on the role of technology in advancing economic development in Asia.      The recent update to the Libra white paper has re-ignited debate around Facebook’s digital currency ambitions, albeit not to summer-2019 temperatures. “Haven’t read it yet” or “not been following for a while” are common responses when I ask my peers how they feel about the latest developments. Given how many of them believe Facebook’s original ambitions have been muzzled under government hostility and regulatory pressure, the declining interest from the blockchain community is perhaps not that surprising. But for those remaining who have read it, it’s become cool in crypto circles to slag off the project as “just another PayPal.” A lazy comparison, really, which insinuates David Marcus isn’t capable of architecting much more than what he’s already done.      But given Libra’s purported focus on delivering financial inclusion for emerging economies, and now a new pledge to provide a set of fiat-backed stablecoins like pseudo-Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), I’d argue that now is not the time to look away from Libra. With 1.7 billion unbanked people around the world, and a global remittance market buckling under the pressure of a pandemic, Facebook and friends are saying they’ll pony up to deliver worldwide payment rails that could finally solve the challenge of onboarding the masses – banked or not – to the digital economy. Even with the remaining regulatory hurdles in their way, this could be an enticing proposal for central banks that lack the means to develop their own CBDC, or those looking to hedge their CBDC bets while they wait to see how the rest of the world moves to navigate this new frontier.      See also: Letter from the Philippines: Life During Coronavirus      Take the Philippines as an example. I’ve lived here since 2018 and it’s not hard to imagine how fast libra could become the preferred tender of Filipinos everywhere. To paint you a picture: While very few are banked – only 22.6 percent of adults have a formal account – the number of mobile phone subscriptions is greater than the number of actual people who live here. Also, according to an annual report by Hootsuite and We Are Social, if a Filipino has access to the internet (that’s two-thirds of the 109 million population), that person is on Facebook. In fact, Filipinos have been the most active social media users in the world for five years running. At nearly four hours every day, they dedicate more time to social media than anyone else, anywhere. The global daily average is just two hours 24 minutes.      Now, overlay this mobile-first, tech-savvy culture with the reality that the Philippines is still a cash-based society struggling to include the vast majority of its citizens in the mainstream financial system. In 2018, digital payments accounted for just 10 percent of the total volume of payments in the Philippines. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) aimed to increase this to 30 percent by 2020, but we’re not there yet. Even with the rapid rise of e-commerce, 83 percent of Filipinos are known to search for what they want online, only to go into the store to purchase with cash. COVID-19 might force in-store behaviors like this to change but still, where items are home delivered, 93 percent of Filipinos will pay Cash on Delivery.      Amanda Dominguez worked closely with the BSP during her time as a senior consultant at the Philippines office for the Ethereum design studio, ConsenSys. Chatting with me from her new home in New York, she says a libra-peso could quickly iron out inefficiencies due to Facebook’s utility and libra’s likeness to cash as opposed to credit. “Libra has the potential to become mainstream because of Facebook’s large user base, which could positively impact the broader blockchain space,” she says, adding that the BSP has been crypto-forward since the early days, having committed to reaching the financially underserved through digital innovation.    In a poor country where Facebook is the internet, Libra could be money.    “Definitely the most responsible approach is for Libra to come in and work directly with the central bank, because there are people there who have made it their mandate to ensure there are safer, cheaper and more reliable forms of payment and transfers for our population,” she says, via Zoom.      As a college student of political science and archaeology, Dominguez wrote her thesis about first century Pompeian graffiti as ancient social media. During those times people loved to scrawl their signatures and draw symbols on the outside walls of elite Roman villas. So when you went to visit someone’s home or office, you could make an assessment about their social standing by checking out who else had etched a sketch on the wall.      Dominguez recognizes similarities between this and the way people publish their connections on Facebook and LinkedIn to make their social networks visible today. She got into blockchain when she saw how her research into reputation-based peer-to-peer marketplaces was aligned with the crypto community’s thinking about the social aspects of digital identity and decentralized commerce.      Growing up in Manila, Dominguez experienced many unique and elaborate local workarounds to bridge the online and offline worlds. For instance, the over-the-counter option that allows you to reserve a flight booking or buy concert tickets via the internet, before paying in cash at the local 7-11. She says the lag in uptake of online payments is not because Filipinos don’t have the digital literacy or technical capability to go through with it. It’s more about the nature of cash. It moves fast and people live paycheck to paycheck. So if you’re unbanked and you spend the majority of your pay packet in cash, why would you go to the extra effort of traveling all the way to the bank, just to queue up and deposit your money and then get burned with account and transaction fees?      See also: Libra’s Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline      But for many people – such as the millions of vulnerable households that rely on money being sent home by family members who work overseas – the cashing in and out process is unavoidable. Making up nearly 10% of Philippine GDP, remittances are an exceptionally slow, clunky and costly business, locked in a paper-based era of bricks-and-mortar inefficiencies.      So this is where Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision really rings true: If it was as easy to send money to the Philippines as it is to send a photo via Facebook Messenger, and if recipients could pay for all they need within the app, they’d never have to cash out again. This is the real opportunity for Libra. Eliminating the need to cash in and out could eliminate cash forever.      Say that the BSP goes and airdrops “free money” libra-pesos to Facebook users, just how PayPal paid its customers to sign up back in the year 2000. The strategy was expensive but successful and something like this would be one helluva incentive program in a country where the average family income is around 22,000 pesos per month ($433). You could get millions upon millions of user registrations in a day.      The next step is to convince users to stop cashing out and start paying digitally instead. This is where the small and mid-sized enterprises (SME) that represent 98 percent of local firms in the Philippines, could bring real momentum to the mobile-first movement. It’s not fantasy to think of scanning my jeepney driver’s QR code to pay for a 9 peso trip. Or tapping a street food seller’s phone to pay for a pork skewer. Or scanning the mobile point of sale at the sari-sari store to buy a San Miguel Light. Maybe they’re running a promo where I can earn a libra-peso to spend next time if I post a selfie with my beer and use the right hashtag.      From a financial inclusion perspective, the flow-on effects of this could be huge. After accepting libra payments for a while and paying their suppliers in-app, a previously paper-based SME has the beginnings of a verifiable financial history. Combine this with check-ins and customer reviews on their Facebook pages and we suddenly have data to feed into an alternative credit scoring model to assess eligibility for a microloan. And considering the cost savings of doing all this digitally, and at scale, we can presume the loan would come at a much more competitive rate than the pawnshops and loan sharks have been pushing the trade for centuries.      If all this is so inevitable, and the potential benefits are so enormous, why hasn’t the local fintech community already delivered on the pipe dream? Theoretically, they could do it. Philippine companies like GCash (Chinese titan, Ant Financial, owns a stake) and blockchain-based Coins.ph have built great tech and demonstrated traction, particularly in allowing users to send and receive money, buy mobile data and pay bills online. But realistically, it’s hard work coaxing new users to download and learn a whole new app, and users have little incentive to stick with something if the critical mass isn't there yet. The real shift will come when people have a reason to use their phones for even the tiniest of everyday payments.      This idea of libra’s digital domination requires little suspension of disbelief when you know how Facebook got its big break into the Philippine market in 2013. Seeing it as its mission to deliver digital inclusion to the millions of poor people who owned a mobile phone but couldn’t afford the data top-up, Facebook partnered with local telcos to offer free access to the app for smartphone users. Internet.org, as it was known, was so successful that in 2015 Facebook extended the initiative to include a curated selection of 24 websites delivering basic internet services related to education, health, employment, communication, information and news. They rolled it out to other developing nations, too, including Colombia, Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, India and Zambia. For many, Internet.org was the only internet they knew.      See also: Filipino Pawnshops Bank on Crypto Remittances During Crisis      In a poor country where Facebook is the internet, libra could be money. Which begs some serious questions about the fine line that exists between empowerment and exploitation. There’s no such thing as a free lunch and Dominguez describes it as “unsettling” to think of all the people who freely signed away their privacy rights to get free data from Facebook.      But she’s less worried about libra if the BSP are at the helm. Dominguez says she trusts the regulators, she trusts the central bank and Filipinos would be able to trust libra if the central bank were involved. This might be difficult for some CoinDesk readers to stomach but the BSP is generally well regarded among Filipinos. For some, it is the most highly rated and trusted institution among all government agencies.      “Trust, in a broader blockchain sense, won’t even be considered,” adds Dominguez, recognizing libra’s true selling point in the Philippines is its ability to provide fast, cheap and easy financial services to the currently underserved in a way that no other has been able to do (yet).      Capitalizing on the kind of consumer reach and distribution that other fintechs only dream about, libra could flip the switch that finally sees the Philippines go digital. Thus, insisting on comparing libra with the superior decentralization and privacy properties of other cryptocurrencies, is kind of missing the point. Libra is hitting on some deep, deep pain points for poorer economies and, frankly, the chance to onboard a formidable chunk of the unbanked may speak louder to those who call the shots. And that’s exactly why those who can understand the trade-offs should not be underestimating libra.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/26/to-see-libras-potential-look-at-the-philippines-not-the-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3121fc04ba429d9f733ff95fe7d1d5fd01149667-1918x1078.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383808,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ykXr,1590503569,India's Central Bank Removes Lingering Confusion Over Banking for Crypto Firms,"India's commercial banks can indeed provide banking services to traders and firms dealing in cryptocurrencies, the nation's central bank clarified last week.      ""As on date, no such prohibition exists,"" the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on May 22. The statement came in response to a query filed by BV Harish, co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Unocoin, under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.      As reported by The Economic Times on Tuesday, the RTI was filed on April 25, seeking clarification on whether banks were still prohibited from providing services to cryptocurrency traders and service providers despite a recent ruling by the Supreme Court to the contrary.      On March 4, India’s Supreme Court quashed a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) order dating back to April, 2018, which restricted banks from providing services to entities dealing with cryptocurrencies.      The RBI had initially planned to file a review petition challenging the Supreme Court’s verdict, as it reportedly believed that trading in virtual currencies would put the country’s banking system at risk. In the end, the central bank did not file the petition, however, neither did it clear the air on crypto trading and taxation. As a result, both banks and the crypto industry have been left in some confusion.      “Since the Supreme Court’s decision, many crypto companies have started resuming their operations by opening up banking channels. However, many banks are still in a dilemma whether to offer their services to crypto companies or individuals since there has been no circular from the RBI ordering the lifting of the ban,” Ashish Singhal, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch.co, told CoinDesk.      Read more: BitGo Now Providing Custody for India’s Largest Crypto Exchange      Meanwhile, Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, said, “while the Supreme Court ruling had made it very clear that there are no curbs on banking for crypto businesses, the RBI reply to [the] RTI filing is very much welcome. There has been confusion amongst many banks despite the Supreme Court ruling because these banks have been waiting for information from RBI.”      CoinDesk reached out to a number of prominent Indian banks in March for information on whether they would allow their customers to use credit or debit cards to fund cryptocurrency purchases. We still haven't received any reply.      Still, exchanges seem confident that the RBI’s clarification will accelerate the growth of the cryptocurrency space in India. “Hopefully, this response can clear up the confusion for the banks and bring clarity to the crypto community in India, which has shown consistent growth since March,” said Singhal.      Shetty said he expects all banks to start servicing crypto businesses without any restrictions. “This marks yet another positive way forward for the crypto ecosystem in India,” he said.

According to an announcement on Tuesday, Facebook subsidiary and Libra wallet provider Calibra has now been rebranded to Novi – a portmanteau of the Latin root words, ""novus"" meaning new and ""via"" meaning way. The first wallet product from the firm is intended to hold Libra's various digital currencies, once the Facebook-led initiative goes live.      Novi also comes with a design revamp that is said to represent ""the fluid movement of digital currencies,"" but maintains an element of the Libra icon in its logo.      ""While we’ve changed our name from Calibra,"" Novi said in a statement, ""we haven’t changed our long-term commitment to helping people around the world access affordable financial services."" Just in case you were worried about that.      See also: Libra’s Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline      Novi also provided a little insight into how the product will work. The digital wallet will operate as a standalone app, as well as providing interoperability with Facebook's social messaging apps Messenger and WhatsApp.      Aimed to make sending funds to friends or family as ""easy as sending a message,"" transactions with Novi will arrive instantly, according to the announcement, and will contain no ""hidden charges."" Novi didn't offer any detail on what any standard transaction fees might be.      All Novi customers will need to be verified using government-issued ID, while ""fraud protections"" will come baked in. The wallet will initially be rolled out to a limited number of countries.      The release date still remains unclear, but the project hopes to introduce ""an early version of Novi when the Libra network is available.""      The wallet and future financial services for the project will now be operated by a new entity, Novi Financial – a Facebook subsidiary that, it said, will operate independently from the social media giant at its Menlo Park, California, headquarters.      The Libra project has suffered a series of setbacks as regulators and governments set off alarm bells over the perceived risks of the project in terms of financial crimes, some even calling it a threat to monetary sovereignty. In 2019, Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg said his company, which is part of the Libra Association, would quit if the project were released prematurely.      In the face of all the pushback, the Libra Association's original model for its digital currency – a stablecoin pegged to a basket of fiat currencies and government bonds – was restructured in mid-April. The project will now issue a number of stablecoins based on individual national currencies in different markets.      Libra still has plans for a multi-currency stablecoin but it will be backed by the new stablecoins and not directly by fiat currencies.      There have been other issues too. In June 2019, major firms including Uber, PayPal, Visa, Stripe, MercadoLibre, Bookings.com and Mastercard were all reported to be backing Facebook’s new crypto project.      See also: Facebook Affirms Libra Commitment With 50 New Job Openings in Ireland      However, pressure from U.S. regulators and lawmakers in October prompted Visa, Mastercard and Stripe to withdraw their affiliations with Libra. It's been adding more new members since then, though, including its first state-owned entity, Temasek. Checkout.com also joined the project last month.

Calling the product a world first, the crypto payroll company said Tuesday it had successfully trialed its bitcoin 401(k) employee pension account and would start offering the plan to companies – especially those trying to meet the 75% payroll requirement in the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).      The PPP has proven to be a lifeline for U.S. businesses struggling in the coronavirus pandemic. A total of $660 billion has been lent out nationwide by the Small Business Administration (SBA). To incentivize staff retention, the program offers 100% loan forgiveness if employers spend at least 75% of funds received on payroll expenses.      Crucially, the SBA includes things such as retirement benefits in the bucket of payroll expenses, says Bitwage. It adds that devoting some of the loans into 401(k) plans can count towards hitting the crucial 75% target.      ""This gives companies an opportunity to provide matching or profit sharing contributions to employee 401k accounts in order to help close the gap to receive full loan forgiveness,"" Bitwage said in a press release. ""Together with the PPP program, the Bitwage Bitcoin 401(k) Plan allows employers to get more out of their PPP loans, while providing their employees new and innovative investment options.""

""Our vision includes integrating a cryptocurrency trading engine directly inside of the 401(k) Plan so institutional as well as retail investors have access to the same exchange-grade trading tools inside of tax-incentivized retirement accounts,"" Bitwage said.

""It may either retrace back to $6,500 or reach $10,000.""      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      With the near-term picture cloudy, some analysts are focusing on a longer-term trend that could be surprisingly bullish for bitcoin: the emergence of digital currencies issued by central banks.      It's not an obvious investment thesis because bitcoin was invented to be used in an electronic peer-to-peer payment system that would be free of government control and operate outside of the traditional banking system.      And most central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, would, by their very nature, be issued and controlled by governments, and in many cases distributed through banks.      But Jack Purdy and Ryan Watkins of the research firm Messari wrote last week in a report that the ""coming digitization of money,"" including the launch of CBDCs, could provide a ""secular tailwind"" for bitcoin.      CBDCs have gained momentum over the past year as countries consider whether to roll out digital versions of their currencies to keep up with Facebook's proposed Libra and China's forthcoming digital currency electronic payment, which is already in testing.      The journal Central Banking, which is supported by the Bank of International Settlements and the European Central Bank among others, found in a survey earlier this month that some 46 countries are considering CBDCs using a constrained form of distributed ledger technology.      Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress in February the U.S. central bank is in the early stages of researching digital currencies, and that having a ""single government currency at the heart of the financial system is something that has served us well.""      Even so, JPMorgan said last week in a report that ""there is no country with more to lose from the disruptive potential of digital currency than the United States,"" as reported by Bloomberg News. ""This revolves primarily around U.S. dollar hegemony.""      The largest U.S. bank's warning merely reinforces the urgency and significance of the efforts, and that's what the Messari analysts were homing in on.      ""Catalyzed by bitcoin and the recognition of the benefits of blockchain technology, many countries and companies around the world have begun researching, testing and launching their own digital currencies,"" the analysts wrote.      ""When these projects launch, they will have the combined effect of exposing billions of people to cryptocurrency-related technologies,"" according to the report. ""This will increase people’s comfort with and understanding of cryptocurrencies, get more people creating and using cryptocurrency wallets, and provide on-ramps into decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.""      So CBDCs might be used to facilitate purchases of bitcoin? That's the idea.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $8,878 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,011 | 24-Hr Low: $8,672        Trend: While bitcoin has recovered from two-week lows reached on Monday, the cryptocurrency is yet to beat key resistance above $9,300.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,000, having put in a low of $8,630, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Prices need to cross Sunday's high of $9,310. That would invalidate the lower highs setup on the 4-hour chart and confirm an end of the pullback from $10,000 and the revival of the bullish trend.      However, as long as prices are held under $9,310, the bearish view put forward by Sunday's downside break of the ascending trendline connecting March 13 and April 21 lows would remain valid.      The uptick from $8,630 to $9,000 seen in the last 24 hours lacks substance, as volumes have remained low throughout the price recovery. A low-volume bounce is often short-lived. Hence, prospects of a strong move above $9,310 look bleak.      Besides, higher time frame charts are reporting a failed breakout. ""The previous weekly candle below the long-term downtrend line support (drawn from June 2019 and February 2020 high), which locally invalidates the bullishness,"" said Adrian Zduńczyk, chartered market technician and CEO of trading community The BIRB Nest.      So another move lower toward $8,630 cannot be ruled out. A violation there would expose 78.6% Fibonacci retracement marked at 8524. ""If that level is broken, it would result in tapping into range lows support $8,000-$8,100. The 50-day average at $8,300 could also offer support,"" said Zduńczyk.      However, if prices rise above $9,300 with strong volumes, a falling wedge breakout would be confirmed on the 4-hour chart. That would open the doors to a re-test of $10,000.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/26/first-mover-bitcoin-could-get-a-boost-from-central-bank-digital-currencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e7dc175c6b4e5537391983a61bdf673f12cf925-1500x937.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383817,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yklh,1590493310,Bitcoin Bounce Stalls at $9K Amid 2% Rise in S&P 500 Futures,"Bitcoin moved back over $9,000 earlier on Tuesday alongside signs of an improved risk appetite in the traditional markets.      Prices rose to a high of $9,010 at 08:05 UTC, but quickly fell back below $8,900, pouring cold water over excitement generated by Monday’s 2.3% bounce from the two-week low of $8,630.      At press time, the number one cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands near $8,860, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Meanwhile, the futures tied to the S&P 500, Wall Street’s equity index, are reporting over 2% gains Tuesday. Major European equity indexes are flashing green, too, with the U.K.’s FTSE index leading the way with a 1.33% gain, as per Investing.com.      West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, North America’s oil benchmark, has so far scored a 2.4% gain on the day, while safe havens such as gold, Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar are nursing losses.      Risk sentiment seems to have been buoyed by reports of a potential coronavirus vaccine. U.S.-based biotech company Novavax said on Monday it is beginning a phase 1 clinical trial of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate in Australia. Results are expected in July.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: Innovation Cycles, Crypto Venture Funds and Institutional Investors      Bitcoin closely tracked action in the equity markets in March and April before decoupling in the two weeks leading up to the reward halving event on May 11. With halving behind us, the cryptocurrency may again start taking cues from equities.      As a result, some traders may expect the cryptocurrency to chart a strong break above $9,000 during the day ahead. However, major exchanges like Bitstamp, which is included in the calculation of Bitwise’s “real” bitcoin trading volume figures, have registered low volumes during the last 24 hours.      That may be gloomy news for the bulls because a low-volume move is often short-lived, according to technical analysis theory. Thus, the sustainability of the recovery toward $9,000 is in question.      Further, the short-term bias looks to have turned bearish due to cryptocurrency’s recent violation of a two-month bullish trendline.      “The steep upwards trend was broken this weekend, and the BTC price crossed the line which has acted as support several times over the past month. If the downwards price action continues, the lower $8,000 area is an important support zone for the price and should see a lot of buyers coming in,” said a weekly update produced by the cryptocurrency exchange Luno and Arcane Research.      Adrian Zdunczyk, a chartered market technician and CEO of trading community The BIRB Nest, also cited the $8,100–$8,000 area in a weekly update. Zdunczyk, however, is still bullish for the long term, as are most observers.      Investors seem to be accumulating coins amid the price drop. On-chain data provided by blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock shows the number of bitcoin addresses holding coins for over a year has reached a new record high of 19.44 million this month, toppling the previous lifetime high of 19.08 million in April.      The metric has been on an upward trajectory for 12 months and is indicative of a strong holding sentiment.      “Record-high long-term holders not only shows the growth of bitcoin's store-of-value use case, but it also demonstrates the fierce conviction of investors who held tight during the 50% market drop, believing it to be a reliable long-term haven against increasingly unpredictable public markets,” said Jehan Chu, co-founder, and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic Capital.      See also: First Mover: Bitcoin Could Get a Boost From Central Bank Digital Currencies      There's a general consensus in the investor community that bitcoin is a hedge against the fiscal and monetary imprudence practiced by governments and central banks over the years, and more so, recently in the efforts to combat the coronavirus-led slowdown in the global economy.      “Investing in tech companies is no longer good enough; investors are now choosing to invest directly in the crypto infrastructure the future will run on,” Chu said.      From a technical analysis standpoint, the overall bias would once more turn bullish if and when prices rise above $10,000. The immediate bearish bias would be invalidated if the risk-on seen in traditional markets powers the cryptocurrency above $9,310.

42383815,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ykct,1590490800,VideoCoin Adds Cash Payments and Rewards in Bid to Take On AWS,"Serial entrepreneur Halsey Minor knows about mass adoption. He’s helped create technology platforms like CNET and Salesforce, to name a couple.      Announced Tuesday, Minor’s VideoCoin platform, which draws on dormant computing resources to process streamed video, is adding fiat payment rails as the project looks to move beyond the limited sphere of crypto and blockchain tokens. The network becomes commercially available starting May 27.      A broader reach is essential, says Minor, CEO of Live Planet, an immersive video startup that provides technology to VideoCoin, in order to take the fight to the market-leading Amazon Web Services (AWS). (Interestingly, Minor’s first job at Merrill Lynch saw him team up with co-worker Jeff Bezos, now Amazon's chief, on a publishing platform.)      “Taking serious aim at mass adoption is surprisingly absent from the crypto industry. There are really no services you can use a credit card to perform,” said Minor. “A company like Fox is never going to go to an exchange and buy volatile tokens. You kind of have to be in the crypto world to use crypto projects – and we are trying to break that barrier down.”      That said, tokens still play a vital role on the platform. VID token holders stake them to earn a slice of the savings gained from decentralizing the work required to process online video. Indeed, VideoCoin’s private token sale raised $50 million back in May 2018, and part of this week’s platform launch (dubbed Everest) is making VideoCoin available on Bittrex, the Seattle-based crypto exchange.      Read more: CNET Founder Backs $50 Million ICO for Video Streaming      “Staking is a really good use case for tokens, but using them for payment just puts friction between you and your users,” Minor said.      VideoCoin’s new fiat capability comes courtesy of Public Mint and allows the platform to accept credit cards, ACH and wire transfers, and to send funds to anyone who has a Public Pay wallet.    Zombie servers    Stepping back, video accounts for 80% of internet traffic and every online video goes through various stages of processing, such as encoding and transcoding to suit different devices. It’s a shift that has upended the traditional broadcast model, which had basically zero distribution costs.      It’s also where AWS is dominant and making big money from its vast network of data centers. But farming out the processing and storage requirements to hundreds of thousands of so-called “zombie servers” that do next to nothing most of the time means VideoCoin will cost firms a third of the price of AWS, said Minor.      “As the global video business moves larger volumes of content to internet delivery, the costs of processing and delivering video have become a huge burden for major media companies,” said John Ward, executive vice president and CTO of video-streaming provider iNDEMAND. “The current [COVID-19] crisis has intensified this.”      AWS did not respond to requests for comment by publication time.    Work it    The VideoCoin platform can be accessed by developers looking to build on its infrastructure and streaming companies that can take advantage of cheaper processing, as well as hardware owners who want to earn money putting it to use (known as “workers”). It’s also open to stakers who allocate jobs to workers ensuring the best possible results, for which these token holders can earn 16% of the overall remuneration.      “Workers will get cash. They will want to build reputation with stakers so they attract more staking,” said Live Planet CTO Devadutta Ghat. “Workers get work dependent on their capacity and the amount of staking they’ve attracted.”      Read more: Meet Crypto’s New Best Friend: Fiat      Ghat said any owner of hardware, from a Raspberry Pi to a data center, can join the platform and become a worker. To illustrate the remuneration workers can expect, he said running a Raspberry Pi node or NVIDIA Jetson Nano 24/7 for a month (total cost of about a dollar) could be paid for by 15-20 minutes of video streaming.      All the workers and stakers on the platform will be visible using a block explorer soon after the Everest launch, Ghat added.    Edgelord    Security cameras and video doorbell companies are another large and growing market, and one which Amazon Ring is capitalizing on by doing video processing at cost. “Streaming cameras have become one of the largest sources of video on the internet today, and demonstrates how dynamic the market for video processing is,” Minor said.

With the advent of 5G, things are moving back to the edge of the network, he said.      “Everyone has done a great job of moving to the cloud,” said Minor. “But now it's opening up all these opportunities at the edge with 5G’s low latency and high bandwidth – and with blockchain, which is sort of the ultimate edge-based technology.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/26/videocoin-adds-cash-payments-and-rewards-in-bid-to-take-on-aws,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a10ae1e932366157372a44464a63719cfc12261b-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The creator of popular messaging service WeChat, Tencent is investing 500 billion yuan ($70 billion) into ""new infrastructure"" based on emerging technologies over the next five years, as reported by Reuters.
