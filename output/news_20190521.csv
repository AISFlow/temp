The group said that $19 million has been earmarked over the next 12 months to be put towards ""building the ethereum of tomorrow.""  Namely, this includes an ambitious scaling upgrade dubbed ethereum 2.0, ""layer 2"" scaling projects such as Plasma, among other research and development projects.  Another $8 million is detailed to be spent over the next 12 months on supporting the current ethereum mainnet through initiatives such as ethereum 1x.  ""Ethereum is used in production today to secure billions of dollars of assets and as a base layer for many hundreds of live applications. We believe that it is vital to continue supporting these efforts to ensure that 'Ethereum 1.0' continues to be the world’s dominant smart-contract platform,"" the Foundation said in a blog post released Tuesday.  The final $3 million is earmarked for developer growth and awareness. As stated in the post, the money will be put towards: developer education and on-boarding, organizing the yearly ethereum conference Devcon, supporting ""regional ethereum community organizations,"" and the like.  Over the last year, the Ethereum Foundation spent a reported total of $27 million awarding monetary grants to 90 different projects. The highest number of grants, 23 in total, went towards ethereum projects focussed on scalability.  All together, the Ethereum Foundation holds approximately 0.6 percent of all ether, equivalent to roughly $160 million, as well as some reserves of cash. As stated in today's blog post, resources ""are intended to decrease over time"" and other third-party actors such as the MolochDAO are encouraged to take a larger role in supporting development in the ethereum ecosystem.      ""Efforts like these give us better leverage from our existing resources, and help build a sustainable path for funding vital projects far into the future,"" the blog post detailed.

42430527,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvSnh,1558468163,Bitfinex Argues Why Judge Should Dismiss NYAG Case in Latest Court Filings,"UPDATE (May 23, 16:30 UTC): Judge Joel Cohen has granted a partial stay on the New York Attorney General's request for documents from Bitfinex and Tether, pending a July 29 hearing on the companies' motion to dismiss.  The NYAG has until July 8 to file a response to the motion, and until the hearing, Bitfinex and Tether are required only to produce documents deemed relevant by a third-party to the question of whether they fall under state jurisdiction.      Bitfinex and Tether have asked a judge to dismiss the New York Attorney General's (NYAG) case against the controversial cryptocurrency firms, claiming they have no customers in the state.  In new court filings Tuesday, lawyers for the two companies, which have overlapping owners and managers, also asked Judge Joel M. Cohen of the New York Supreme Court to stay the NYAG's ""onerous"" request for documents from Bitfinex and Tether while he considers the motion.  The firms ""have nothing to do with New York investors — the businesses do not allow New Yorkers on their platforms and do not advertise or otherwise do business here,"" attorneys Jason Weinstein and David I. Miller wrote.  Further, the attorney general ""has not identified, even in a general sense, any 'victim' in New York (or, it should be noted, anywhere else),"" and the office is using a New York law, the Martin Act, that governs securities and commodities, of which Tether's product, the stablecoin USDT, is neither, the lawyers argued.  Hence, the companies ""respectfully request that the entire proceeding be dismissed for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction.""  In a separate affidavit, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel for both Bitfinex and Tether, wrote that both companies prohibit any U.S. residents, including New Yorkers, from transacting on their platforms, and that only verified Tether customers are allowed to redeem USDT for dollars, not just anyone who buys the stablecoin on the secondary market.  Backed by ... bitcoin?  Separately, in a hearing last week, Miller let it slip that Tether had previously invested a portion of its reserves in bitcoin.  At some point before the NYAG obtained its preliminary injunction against the companies, ""Tether actually did invest in instruments beyond cash and cash equivalents, including bitcoin, they bought bitcoin,"" Miller told the court, according to a transcript of the May 16 hearing published Tuesday by crypto publication The Block. He later said it was ""a small amount.""  It was a notable admission since until recently Tether has maintained that USDT was backed 1-for-1 with U.S. dollars (in February it updated its terms and conditions to say the collateral could include other assets, which later turned out to include a loan to Bitfinex). Even Judge Cohen sounded surprised.  ""Tether sounded to me like sort of the calm in the storm of cryptocurrency trading,"" he told Miller, according to the transcript. ""And so if tether is backed by bitcoin, how is that consistent?""  One possible explanation is that the ""small amount"" is very small, and not really part of the backing. Alistair Milne, an investorhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-14/crypto-market-relieved-as-1-billion- in Bitfinex's recent token sale, wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that Tether holds less than 1 bitcoin simply to fund transactions on the Omni protocol, which runs on top of the original cryptocurrency's blockchain.  To be precise, the company has 0.075 bitcoin, or about $600 worth, a speck compared to the $2.8 billion in tethers outstanding, according to an Omni Explorer link shared by Milne. Neither a spokesperson for Tether nor its attorney Miller had answered CoinDesk's requests for comment by press time.  Late last month, the NYAG secured the preliminary injunction freezing Tether’s assets and asking for documents about a $625 million loan and a $900 million line of credit it offered to Bitfinex.  The crypto exchange needed the funds to continue processing customer withdrawals after losing access to some $850 million that is said to be held by Crypto Capital, a payment processor that is also in the cross-hairs of investigators.

42430541,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvTBh,1558466653,"At Blockchain Week, Maturity Is the Motto as Ethereum Organizations Push Toward 2.0 Upgrade","The ethereum movement, headed by flagship organizations like the Ethereum Foundation and the Brooklyn-based conglomerate ConsenSys, emerged from Blockchain Week 2019 with a common goal and a newfound sense of urgency.  In short, building ethereum 2.0 -- the blockchain network's ambitious reinvention plan -- will require maturity.  “The only people left are those that want to be here and are working hard,” former Ethereum Foundation consultant Eva Beylin said of the broader ethereum ecosystem. She spoke with CoinDesk at the ETH New York hackathon last weekend, where about 50 developers sat nearby coding and chatting with little fanfare.  Earlier in the week, the vibe was similar if certainly more flashy at the ConsenSys-organized Ethereal Summit in Brooklyn.  There, the Ethereum Foundation’s head of special projects, Virgil Griffith, told CoinDesk that relations with ConsenSys are getting “better,” despite lingering distrust between the nonprofit crowd and the for-profit venture headed by ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin.  “We decided to outsource all the value-capture to ConsenSys,” Griffith said. “A lot of people in the foundation are wary of ConsenSys. But I think you can work with someone with a different view than you.”  Indeed, despite their divergent goals, the leaders of these two organizations arguably exert the most influence on ethereum's development and usage. Based on CoinDesk's conversations with 10 high-ranking people associated with ethereum's top projects, this Blockchain Week may have been a turning point.  ConsenSys CMO Amanda Gutterman also told CoinDesk relations with the Ethereum Foundation are now better than ever, even as ConsenSys seeks to monetize some of the products and services the broader ecosystem relies on. This comes as the company emerges from a winter marked by layoffs and lingering doubts that its portfolio of startups can be spun out of the ConsenSys mothership.  Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation has been more focused on support for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications like Uniswap and MakerDAO, two projects supporters say embody ethereum’s collaborative spirit.  “We can and should build a financial system that is more equitable and open,” Uniswap founder Hayden Adams told CoinDesk.  In stark contrast to the individualistic bitcoin ethos, the DeFi movement is explicitly focused on rebuilding the global financial system. Uniswap, which now holds more than $14.9 million worth of ether, was developed under the guidance of ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and funded by a grant from the Ethereum Foundation before it raised venture capital in April 2019.  Still, Adams told CoinDesk there remain unanswered questions about whether Buterin's cohort can “pull off” a functioning version of ethereum 2.0.  Meanwhile, ConsenSys alum and SpankChain CEO Ameen Soleimani, has emerged as a community organizer – announcing at Ethereal that his MolochDAO for funding ethereum infrastructure projects would be jointly funded by Lubin, Vitalik and a group of ConsenSys and Ethereum Foundation employees.  Soleimani told CoinDesk he hopes 2019 will be a time of collaboration.  Speaking of Lubin and Buterin’s leadership, Soleimani said:  “They have certainly guided us thus far and they seem well-positioned to make the best decisions.”  Leadership  Based on interviews with numerous ethereum veterans across organizations, it appears that crucial decisions are on the horizon.  On May 10 at Ethereal, Ethereum Foundation executive director Aya Miyaguchi said the nonprofit plans to spend $30 million on ecosystem development this year.  One of the foundation’s main wallets shows that 2018 was a year of peak spending, with a balance worth $600 million in January 2018 plummeting to $67 million by January 2019. Even counting in ether, the foundation spent roughly 100,000 tokens from this primary wallet last year and only has 643,536 tokens left in it.  While Miyaguchi said at Ethereal that the nonprofit employs more than 100 freelance contractors, she later told CoinDesk there is not a “clear line” between the support structures offered to various teams. This applies to both freelance contracts and grants. Instead, she said the foundation makes decisions on a case-by-case basis by evaluating: “What are the most important things for us to support?”  According to former Ethereum Foundation employee Lane Rettig, who was laid off earlier this year and then became a controversial-yet-admired figure on Twitter, the foundation plans to cut staff to reduce its burn rate.  Griffith confirmed the Ethereum Foundation’s long-term plan, which is still under consideration, is to reduce its role in direct funding and governance by encouraging external community growth. However, no official plans for this – or staff cuts – have been made so far, Miyaguchi said.  “It’s not about winding down. It’s about shifting our role,” she told CoinDesk, describing the foundation’s new role as one of “coordination” between other players to help them build tools and use cases.  Partnerships  For the time being, the nonprofit doesn’t have any income model and mostly relies on reserves from the original ether token sale in 2014. As such, its future depends on establishing strong partnerships that can continue to work after grant funding tapers off.  Based on conversations with several sources, it appears the nonprofit’s priorities include developer projects such as MolochDAO, then industry collaborations with the likes of ConsenSys and Microsoft and finally partnerships with governmental agencies, most of which are still in the exploratory phase.  It remains to be seen which external organizations will commit significant resources to sustaining the ethereum network, and partnership-building certainly isn't immune to infighting. An anonymous source told CoinDesk that Microsoft received complaints from Buterin about a perceived lack of focus on ethereum in the tech giant’s decentralized identity (DID) project, for example.  Buterin himself outlined some of the plans for making ethereum work at scale in a proposal published during Blockchain Week. Insiders tell CoinDesk a driving force behind the move for more coordination is a dawning realization: This may be the year the community finds champions to implement that vision or fails to scale entirely.

The company – which owns trading platform Poloniex, equity crowdfunding site SeedInvest and the USDC stablecoin in partnership with Coinbase – is looking to cut costs, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire told CoinDesk via a spokesperson.  “We made these changes in response to new market conditions, most importantly, an increasingly restrictive regulatory climate in the United States,"" Allaire said. ""Circle remains strong and healthy, and we will continue to drive new product innovation and growth globally, working with jurisdictions that offer forward-looking policies regulating digital asset businesses, while we press for more balanced crypto policy in the U.S.""  On Monday, Allaire wrote a blog post detailing how regulatory uncertainty forced Circle to geofence some assets on Poloniex from U.S. customers.  The cuts appear to primarily affect the company's Boston headquarters, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told CoinDesk. At the company's New York office, cuts were reportedly spread across the finance and product departments, the source said. Some unfilled positions were cut as well.

Dutch tax authority's investigative department, FIOD, announced the news Monday, saying that the man was a director of two private limited companies where he convinced around 100 people to buy computers for mining bitcoins that he probably never purchased.  The man is accused of fraud, forgery, and money laundering, the department said, adding that he allegedly spent investor money on luxury items such as cars, motorbikes, travel, and gambling.  The suspect started his businesses in 2017 by promising investors return of around 0.3 bitcoin a month (currently worth around $2,389). When investors did not get the returns and their mining computers back, several of them filed complaints.  Back in November 2018, the FIOD and police raided the suspect’s home and business premises and seized expensive goods such as bags, shoes, and a bike.  The FIOD said fighting money laundering is the priority for the government as it is one of the “serious” crimes.  Earlier this year, Dutch financial authorities were planning a licensing scheme for cryptocurrency firms to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.

42430531,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvSvh,1558454427,Craig Wright Is Playing Three-Dimensional Checkers,"Craig Wright's attempt to copyright the bitcoin white paper is a bold, if silly, move by a person who may be both of those things.  Copyright registration is a simple way of claiming ownership of a literary work, song, or piece of art. I could, for example, claim copyright over my exciting new musical ""Bitcoin White Paper LIVE!"" (shown below), a theatrical rendition of Satoshi Nakamoto's seminal writing in the style of Rogers and Hammerstein. But should I?  No. That would be silly.  Clearly, Wright thought he should. As revealed Tuesday, in April he filed registrations of the white paper with the U.S. Copyright Office on behalf of, we learned, the Bitcoin Association and the suddenly popular BSV token.  To be fair, there's a certain game-theoretical logic to Wright's move. Suppose (humor me here) Wright is Satoshi, as he has claimed for years. Then his copyright should hold up against any court challenge, settling once and for all the question of who Satoshi is... right?  If Wright isn't Satoshi and the real Satoshi wants to claim copyright, she still would have to go to court and exhibit prior proof of authorship, which Twitter pumpers will say is also good for bitcoin somehow.  Finally, if Satoshi never shows up then Wright can do what he wants with the copyright, including sue others for infringement, who might then file countersuits to stop Wright from enforcing copyright.  Any of these scenarios will lead to little more than a few additional exciting headlines about bitcoin ownership in the mainstream media. We folks in the know will nod sagely and go on with our lives.    BitCoin White Paper LIVE! by John Biggs on Scribd    Speaking of nodding sagely, Star Wars fans will recognize this as an excellent opportunity to leave the old ways behind.  Just as a bolt of lightning destroyed the original Jedi texts in that tree on Blue Milk Island while Yoda hooted in ghost form, the same thing is now happening to the legend of Satoshi. Her technology and concepts have moved far beyond the desires and whims of one anonymous author, Australian or not, and so we enter a new, post-Satoshi era today.  In fact, Satoshi no longer matters. Any way you slice this thala-siren bologna, we win.

At 13:15 UTC, the price 11th largest crypto by market cap rank reached a 24-hour high of $139.31, a figure more than 120 percent higher than its UTC opening price of $62.99, according to CoinMarketCap data.  On some exchanges, however, BSV’s sudden price surge was even more drastic, increasing as much as 214 percent to reach $195 in the BSV/USDT market on the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global.  The surge is due in part to the announcement that Craig Wright has registered copyright claims on the Bitcoin Whitepaper and original code and promised to revert the copyright to the Bitcoin Association.  A release today notes:  Wright intends to assign the copyright registrations to Bitcoin Association to hold for the benefit of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Association is a global industry organization for Bitcoin businesses. It supports BSV and owns the Bitcoin SV client software.  Messari data reveals the total exchange reported 24-hour volume for BSV is $447.6 million whereas its “Real 10” volume from the 10 exchanges identified as the sole exchanges reporting honest volume figures in a report from Bitwise Asset Management reveals today’s volume figure is closer to $31.8 million.  Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, typically abbreviated as Bitcoin SV, is a fork of the bitcoin cash blockchain and was recently delisted from a number of well known exchanges including Binance, Kraken and Shapeshift due to its main proponent Craig Wright, claiming that he is Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of bitcoin, which many assume to be fraudulent.  Many other cryptocurrencies are flashing notable gains today, albeit not to the extent of BSV.  Bitcoin Gold (BTG), neo (NEO), tron (TRX) and bitcoin cash (BCH) are all reporting 24-hour gains above 5 percent according to data from CoinDesk.

In a press release Tuesday, the commission alleged that defendant Jose Angel Aman operated a purported crypto business called Argyle Coin as a Ponzi scheme, using investments from new recruits to pay returns to previous investors.  According to the SEC complaint, Aman is said to have fleeced over 300 investors since May 2014 by selling unregistered securities in two other firms he owns: Natural Diamonds Investment Co. (Natural Diamonds) and Eagle Financial Diamond Group Inc.  He ""falsely promised"" investors that the firms would invest in whole diamonds to cut down and sell for substantial profits, the SEC said. He was allegedly assisted in the scheme by Harold Seigel and Jonathan H. Seigel, who also had interest in the two firms.  According to the press release:  ""Aman and Jonathan H. Seigel continued the scheme by luring investors to invest in Argyle Coin, falsely claiming the investment was risk-free because it was backed by fancy colored diamonds, and promising to use investor funds to develop the cryptocurrency business. ""  In fact, Aman, Natural Diamonds, Eagle and Argyle Coin, ""misused or misappropriated"" over $10 million of investors' money to pay other investors their supposed returns under the scheme. Aman is claimed to have also squandered the investments on personal expenses, including rent, horse purchases and riding lessons for his son.  Eric I. Bustillo, director of the SEC’s Miami Regional Office, said:  ""As alleged, Aman operated a complicated web of fraudulent companies in an effort to continually loot retail investors and perpetuate the Ponzi schemes as well as divert money to himself. The SEC's diligent investigative work uncovered the Ponzi schemes and our goal is to bring justice to the harmed investors.""  Judge Robin L. Rosenberg of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida has now granted the SEC’s request for a temporary restraining order and temporary asset freeze against Aman and Argyle Coin, as well as the other companies. The court has also appointed a receiver for Argyle Coin.  Natural Diamonds, Eagle, Argyle Coin, Aman, Harold Seigel and Jonathan H. Seigel face charges over securities registration violations, while Natural Diamonds, Eagle, Argyle Coin and Aman are charged with securities fraud.  The SEC said it is seeking repayment of ""allegedly ill-gotten gains"" and prejudgment interest, as well as financial penalties.

The platform reportedly had around 3 million monthly active users and nearly 35,000 active streamers as of March.  PewDiePie, the 29-year-old Swedish content creator, real name Felix Kjellberg, signed an “exclusive” live streaming deal with DLive last month. His YouTube channel has over 95 million subscribers at press time, with his most recent video racking up close to 3 million views in less than 24 hours.  DLive is a decentralized platform built using the Lino Network blockchain, which rewards both content creators and viewers using its native token, “Lino points.” It takes no percentage of earnings and does not charge fees to content creators, although they do face platform fees when exchange tokens for fiat currency.  Wilson Wei, Lino Network co-founder, told Nikkei Asian Review:  ""I think the lack of transparency and the huge cut that platforms take from content creators, are the two biggest problems the online streaming industry has. And blockchain is the perfect technology to solve both problems.”  DLive reportedly has plans to grow beyond its rival, Amazon-owned live streaming video platform Twitch, which takes a 50 percent cut from streamers and currently has 2.2 million daily broadcasters and 15 million daily viewers on average.  Lino raised $20 million in February 2018 to build a “YouTube on the blockchain” in a private token sale led by ZhenFund.

The registrations, which are visible here and here, pertain specifically to ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" and ""Bitcoin,"" meaning the original 2009 code.  A press release sent to CoinDesk states:  ""In the future, Wright intends to assign the copyright registrations to Bitcoin Association to hold for the benefit of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Association is a global industry organization for Bitcoin businesses. It supports BSV and owns the Bitcoin SV client software.""  Founding President Jimmy Nguyen commented in the release:  “We are thrilled to see Craig Wright recognized as author of the landmark Bitcoin white paper and early code. Better than anyone else, Craig understands that Bitcoin was created be a massively scaled blockchain to power the world’s electronic cash for billions of people to use, and be the global data ledger for the biggest enterprise applications. We look forward to working with Craig and others to ensure his original vision is recognized as Bitcoin and is realized through BSV.”  To be clear, registration does not imply ownership nor is this an official patent. The copyright process allows anyone to register anything in an effort to prepare, say, for lawsuits associated to ownership.  Computer code and white papers can be copyrighted insofar as they are considered literary works and, as the copyright office writes: ""In general, registration is voluntary. Copyright exists from the moment the work is created. You will have to register, however, if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work.”  In other words you, the reader, could register this post and I would have to fight you in court to contest it.  Jerry Brito, executive director at advocacy group Coin Center, tweeted:  https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1130812389048238080?s=12  ""People register things for a reason. They want to exploit it and they want the credit for it,"" said David H. Faux, Esq., an intellectual property attorney in New York City. “Someone dishonest would register the Bitcoin white paper to put it on his website and get speaking engagements. But at some point it would catch up with him.”  ""The market takes care of itself,"" said Faux.  When asked for comment noted Wright critic Jameson Lopp said ""LOL.""  CoinDesk has contacted Wright's representatives and the Copyright Office for further comment.  UPDATE - Wright wrote:  “BTC is not bitcoin. Bitcoin is set in stone and does not change. Where there is a protocol change, there is developer control which is the exact opposite of what bitcoin is about. BTC is passing off as Bitcoin. It is an air drop copy that has been designed to slowly alter the protocol allowing the system to be anonymized to such an extent that criminal activity can happen.

Flynn said in a press release provided to CoinDesk:  “Vegan Nation is the basis of an international vegan economy that makes vegan lives simpler, more economical, and better for the Earth and the soul of each of us. VeganCoin will allow many more to become vegans and thereby contribute to the reduction of our ecological footprint.”  As part of its planned decentralized ""vegan economy,"" VeganNation is launching a ""traceable"" digital currency called VeganCoin. The token went on pre-sale at the end of April, with 10 percent of proceeds to go to incentivize its ecosystem validators (or ""rangers"") and community, according to the Vegan Nation ""green paper.""  VeganNation ultimately aims to track the origin of foods or products on its platform and authenticate whether they are 100 percent vegan and cruelty-free. Services will also include a product marketplace, online social platform and an app for iOS and Android.  Flynn has been a vegetarian for the past 35 years and vegan for the last five.

A new Bitfinex service called Tokinex will announce its first token launch this Thursday, followed by the debut of a second token on June 13.  ""What it means to be an exchange has evolved alongside the maturing crypto market. It has become an entire ecosystem, not just limited to the remit of trading digital assets,"" said Jean Louis van der Velde, CEO of Bitfinex and Ethfinex.  Bitfinex follows other major exchanges like OKCoin, KuCoin and Binance into this new line of business. Thus far there have been several advantages to fundraising with an IEO over an initial coin offering (ICO). Most notably, the arrangement usually comes with a commitment from the exchange to handle all Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks on a startup's behalf. IEOs also usually come with a commitment by the exchange to promote the offering to its pool of customers.  These services usually are contingent on hefty fees, but startups approved to run on Tokinex will face no upfront costs and, after successfully completing fundraising, the token will become listed on both Bitfinex and Ethfinex, according to company officials.  Participants will register through the Tokinex site where they will receive KYC checks from Blockpass, research materials on offerings and settlements through their existing exchange wallet.  A Bitfinex spokesperson told CoinDesk users will not be charged fees to access these sales. ""You also don't need to hold any exchange tokens to participate,"" they said.  In addition to Tokinex, the company just launched LEO, its exchange token. Previously, Binance tested the idea of using a token to lower trading expenses on a given exchange with its BNB token.  Update (May 21, 13:58 UTC): Following publication, Bitfinex replied to a request for comment about user participation costs. The article has been updated with that information.

In a media release Tuesday, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) alleged that the IT contractor from the Sydney suburb of Killara had modified government computer systems to mine cryptocurrency worth over AU$9,000 (US$6,184) for his own gain.  The unnamed man will attend a local court today over two charges – unauthorized modification of data to cause impairment and unauthorized modification of restricted data – under the country’s Criminal Code Act, according to the AFP.  Last year, AFP police officers seized a laptop, phone, employee ID cards and data files in a raid conducted at the contractor's home.  The charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and two years imprisonment, respectively.  Chris Goldsmid, AFP acting commander and manager of cybercrime operations, described the alleged crime as “very serious,” explaining:  “Australian taxpayers put their trust in public officials to perform vital roles for our community with the utmost integrity. Any alleged criminal conduct which betrays this trust for personal gain will be investigated and prosecuted.”  The news marks just the latest instance of employees who have got in hot water for mining cryptos at work.  To cite just a few, in 2017, a former employee of the Federal Reserve Board of Directors was also fined $5,000 and put on probation after being caught mining bitcoins on a server owned by the U.S. central bank.  Nuclear scientists at a Russian weapons research facility were charged for the same crime last February. And, last November, two school principals in China were caught stealing power from their institution to mine the cryptocurrency ether.

Citing data from Action Fraud, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced Tuesday that, although the number of reported cases has increased, total reported losses actually fell from about £38 million ($48 million) to £27 million ($34 million). The average individual loss has also dropped to £14,600 ($18,575) from £59,600 ($75,827).  The majority (81 percent) of the reported cases were related to cryptocurrency scams, the regulator added.  Action Fraud director, Pauline Smith, said:  “These figures are startling and provide a stark warning that people need to be wary of fake investments on online trading platforms. It’s vital that people carry out the necessary checks to ensure that an investment they’re considering is legitimate.”  Scammers have increasingly been using social media platforms to promote their “get rich quick” schemes, often using fake celebrity endorsements, the watchdog said. Investors were often led to believe that their first investment would turn a profit.  Earlier this year, the FCA published a survey, saying that 73 percent of U.K. consumers don’t know what a cryptocurrency is, yet many fall prey to such schemes after being drawn to the lure of quick profits. The regulator at the time said that it will consult on banning the sale of certain cryptocurrency derivatives to retail investors later this year – a ban the authority has been considering since last November.  The FCA has warned several times on cryptocurrency derivatives products and unregistered crypto brokerage firms. It is also working with the U.K. government and the Bank of England, as part of the country’s Cryptoassets Taskforce effort to form regulatory guidelines for the cryptocurrency space.
