This enables us to serve more clients, better.”  “As a long-time user of Altonomy’s trading services, it was an easy decision for us to invest in their business when the opportunity became available,” said Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee.  “We are proud of our ability to source liquidity for customers, regardless of token type, order size, market cap, or whether the asset trades on centralized or decentralized exchanges,” added Li.  Li wasn’t alway so bullish on altcoins. In January 2019 he told entrepreneurs who raised via initial coin offerings to ""to liquidate enough ETH so they would have at least two years of runway.""  Now, however, the founder sees a rebirth.  In the last year Altonomy also launched AltMiner, a cloud service for bigger clients looking to dip a toe in the mining industry.

42382328,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rIiJ,1563224450,Huobi Burns 14 Million Huobi Tokens Amid Revenue Gains,"Huobi, one of the world's oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, has taken steps to reduce the supply of the token that powers its global ecosystem, Huobi Token (HT), in a quarterly burning event.  According to a company statement, the exchange removed 14,011,700 tokens from a 310,318,300 market supply, at a rate that is 116 percent greater than it did last quarter. The company cited “improving market conditions” and sales growth for the decision.  The move is intended to stabilize the currency's price, as well as create an incentive for users to hold the token by curbing inflation. Every quarter since early 2018 when the Singapore-based exchange introduced Huobi Token, it has spent 20 percent of its quarterly revenues buying back outstanding tokens.  Revenues fluctuate quarter to quarter, meaning Huobi does not always burn a consistent amount. This past quarter is no different. Driven by strong growth, the company's revenues put towards its token burning plan represents an increase of 232 percent quarter-over-quarter. Beginning on April 15, Huobi held eight token burning events of a total 21,356,800 HT, more than the 6,474,800 HT it repurchased in the first quarter.  The repurchased tokens are stored in a visible ethereum address, dubbed the Huobi Investor Protection Fund, and act as a reserve fund.{""type"":""block"",""srcClientIds"":[""8db10df2-dab5-45b5-9f75-26c21f01762c""],""srcRootClientId"":""""}  Leon Li, CEO and Founder of Huobi Group said:  “There are two big trends reflecting the size of this quarter’s buyback. The first is a rapidly strengthening market for digital assets and the other is the increasing popularity of our entire product line.”  The company cited increasing membership to Huobi Prime and Huobi FastTrack programs – generators of fees – as well as a productive Spring for the $504 billion trading volume Huobi DM platform.  “The rest of 2019 will see even more improvements and innovations coming from Huobi,” said Li, pointing to further developments to the recently launched Huobi Finance Chain, a decentralized finance public blockchain, and improvements to the high frequency algorithmic API.  In a separate post, the company said this token burn cycle “will be the last time HT tokens will be destroyed using the traditional buyback method.”  Going forward, the company looks to use revenues generated in the HT Tiered Fee deduction program to directly burn tokens. It has also proposed to start sourcing one-thirds of the burnable tokens from team holdings, and the rest from the open market. Additionally, the company is considering switching to monthly or daily burns, from quarterly.  ""No final decision has been made yet, however. We’ll be discussing this more with our community,"" Li said.  As of today, the total circulating supply of the ethereum ERC-20 token is 478,643,200. The native tokens are used to gain access to “premium coins” through Huobi Prime, as security deposits for merchants on its over the counter exchange, Huobi OTC merchants, and to vote.  Huobi Group was established in 2013 in China, and now comprises 10 seperate businesses. It operates in more than 130 countries, and exceeds $1 trillion in accumulative turnover.

42382334,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rIr7,1563222639,Crypto Genius or Fake? The Craig Wright Saga Explained,"https://youtu.be/KobjCAXXHLY  ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth,"" said boxing superstar Mike Tyson.  This year, the so-called father of bitcoin, Craig Wright, tasted first blood.  Wright has long been adamant about his position as the creator of bitcoin. Much to a skeptical crypto ecosystem's chagrin, he has done everything except prove he was Satoshi Nakamoto, from registering the Bitcoin White Paper as his own to showing private keys that anyone could have accessed. In fact, the month of May brought many seeming triumphs and his currency - BTCSV - rose to $226 before a tumble of 100 points. The end of June brought more trouble with Wright sitting in a courtroom seemingly cowed before a judge.  The reason for his swift fall? Wright had to answer hard questions about his real involvement in a multi-billion dollar fund that he formed with his deceased business partner, Dave Kleiman. And those hard questions could, in the end, unmask the real Satoshi.  The Suit  Wright is being sued by Ira Kleiman on behalf of the estate of his late brother for scheming to, according to the filing, “seize Dave’s bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property associated with the bitcoin technology.”  Kleiman's attorney's are attempting to prove that Wright transferred Kleiman's assets to his personal or companies' accounts, hid the evidence by backdating legal contracts, and forged a series of contracts and Dave’s signature on them.  At the heart of the lawsuit is a 1.1 million bitcoin Tulip Trust, which Kleiman alleges is comprised of coins collectively mined by his brother with Wright. The nChain chief scientist wholeheartedly denies this claim. In June, a redacted declaration surfaced that outlined Wright's purported ownership of the trust fund. In the document Wright claimed he had mined or purchased the entire lot between 2009 and 2011.  Elsewhere, Wright has put forward that Kleiman's involvement in the trust was limited to drafting the legal prose as well as assisting in the development of the complicated Shamir’s Secret Sharing Algorithm used to shield the multi-billion dollar holding. What's more, according to Wright, the private keys needed to decrypt the fund were distributed amongst corporate entities and mutual friends, including companies that have been liquidated as well as a former associate that he ""has not been in touch with... since 2016,"" making the Tulip Trust inaccessible.  Though the initial complaint did not seek to ascertain whether Wright's alias is truthfully Nakamoto, the lawsuit can be seen as an outgrowth of that controversy.  Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?  Three and a half years ago, Wired andGizmodo published reports that pointed to Wright as the likely inventor of bitcoin. Though far from conclusive, the evidence stoked a media frenzy, which was exacerbated by a mysterious ""trust.""  Adding fuel to the fire was an ongoing investigation by Australian tax authorities into Wright's bitcoin holdings, which, after a police raid of Wright's home, drove the academic to England.  It was there that Wright held demonstrations for the BBC, The Economist and GQ where he presented control of some of first mined blocks on the bitcoin blockchain. He also published a ""digital signature"" used by Nakamoto in his blog. While these actions convinced some prominent bitcoin personalities, many remained skeptical, including bitcoin code contributor Jeff Garzik, who said:  ""My personal theory is that it’s [Satoshi Nakamoto] Floridian Dave Kleiman. It matches his coding style, this gentleman was self taught. And the Bitcoin coder was someone who was very, very smart, but not a classically trained software engineer.”  Following the backlash, Wright said he would not publish additional information tying him to Nakamoto. He blogged at the time:  “I believed that I could do this. I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot.”  Yet, in May, Wright filed registrations with the U.S. Copyright Office over the original bitcoin code and white paper. In itself, a copyright does not prove the holder invented the technology. However, some saw the move as preparation for Wright's coming libel suits against Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, and podcaster Peter McCormack. Over the past year Wright has become increasingly hostile towards his detractors, which also includes Ethereum inventor Vitalki Buterin and technologist John McAfee.  As stated previously, Kleiman's attorneys had no intention of ascertaining Nakamoto's identity. They wrote in the initial court filings, “it is unclear whether Craig, Dave and/or both created Bitcoin,” adding, ""it is undeniable, however, that Craig and Dave were involved in Bitcoin from its inception and that they both accumulated a vast wealth of bitcoins from 2009 through 2013.""  On April 16, Wright – who is being represented in the suit by Miami law firm Rivero Mestre LLP – moved to dismiss the complaint. In the motion, Weight argued that Ira Kleiman’s claims are without merit and that the plaintiff lacks any standing to file suit, calling the effort an “attempted shakedown” based on “a thin soup of supposition, speculation, conflicting allegations, hearsay and innuendo.”  As of a June 18 mediation session, the two parties were at an impasse, meaning the trial may progress to court.  Wright Calls Wright  A June 28 evidentiary hearing, a transcript of which was published shortly afterwards reveals much about how the rest of Wright’s legal odyssey may play out.  A forthcoming decision in this hearing does not only have implications for the ongoing Kleiman v Wright suit, but also for aforementioned libel cases Wright has lobbed against Roger Ver and Peter McCormack, who both accused Wright of fraudulently representing himself as Satoshi Nakamoto.  The last series of questions directed towards Wright on June 28 concerned his presentation at the Transform Africa summit in May 2018. At the time Wright noted the Rwandan GDP was around $8 billion, only to claim that he had more money than the entire country.  In court, however, he changed his tune.  “I was angry at the time,"" he said. ""It didn't mean I could access or control it, and nor have I.”  This is part of Wright’s pattern of staking claims and then reversing them.  During the hearing, Wright gave testimony explaining why his $10 billion in bitcoin holdings – established in the Tulip Trust – are both legally and technologically inaccessible. This is the same stockpile Ira Kleiman, brother of Wright’s former business partner, Dave Kleiman, is suing for.  Ira’s representative at Boies Schiller Flexner, Velvel Freedman, claimed in the day-long hearing that Wright had embezzled funds from the Kleiman estate by forging documents and emails pertaining to the Trust, which allegedly contain 1.1 million bitcoin conjointly mined by Dave and Wright.  Despite multiple court orders, and threats of either a civil or criminal contempt charge, Wright had only published the first 70 addresses, which he also claims link him to his alter-ego, Satoshi Nakamoto. These listings allegedly correspond to the first 70 bitcoin blocks mined, before an unknown party joined the network at block 74.  Lawful Witness  “I'm very focused on ensuring things fall within the rules, and if I'm ordered to do something by a valid court, and I can do it, I will do whatever I have to do it,” Wright said, after claiming his invention “of Bitcoin was to create a system, not where code is law, but where code and law work together.”  He said he stopped mining in August 2010, after noticing bitcoin’s use for illegal activities on deep web markets such as the Silk Road and Hydra. At that point, he brought in forensic expert Dave Kleiman to “wipe” his involvement with Bitcoin from the public record and set up an encryption scheme and bonded courier service that would keep the tainted wealth out of his hands until at least 2020.  Wright also claimed that Dave prevented him from “destroying [bitcoin] utterly,” and that if he ever regains access to the trust, “every one of [the bitcoins] will go to funding educational charities for the poorest 1 billion people on Earth.”  However, despite Wright’s alleged efforts to provide a full inventory of his bitcoin addresses, including employing the chief technology officer of nChain Steve Shadders to develop software to dig for possible addresses, the funds remain elusive.  Freedman, during his cross-examination, had a tough time swallowing that Craig could lose access what amounts to about $10 billion in bitcoin.  Cross-Examination  For his part, Freedman’s strategy during his cross-examination of Wright was to tease out purported inconsistencies between Wright’s testimony and documents submitted to the court as evidence, ultimately attempting to show a willful disregard for the court’s orders.  “It looks like the modus operandi of the defendant is to take emails, you know, from Dave or from other people that were around the relevant time period and alter data,” Freedman said while addressing the bench after the cross-examination.  Freedman brought up an email allegedly sent to Wright from Kleiman in 2011, which elaborated on the creation of the Tulip Trust at the heart of the case.  When examining the metadata of the document, Freedman alleged it had been badly altered in 2014 “to try and create evidence that Dave transferred Bitcoin into a trust under [Wright’s] control.”  The email was apparently received on Thursday, the 24th of June, 2011, which Freedman showed to actually be a Friday. Furthermore, the document contained a Calibri font copyrighted by Microsoft in 2015.  Wright’s defense first involved an arcane explanation of “create” dates and “modify” dates. When pressed, he stated bluntly, “This is a PDF of an email, not the email… You are committing perjury by falsely putting in a document. That is not real evidence. You have created something,” and threw the print out.  Wright also claimed the document came from corrupted servers of a company that was being forced into liquidation at the time.  “When someone has modified a file on a compromised server that was hacked, and is known to be hacked, then all sorts of funny things happen,” he said.  Freedman then pointed out the email was sent via Craig@panopticrypt on PCCSW01 – CSW being Wright’s initials. Wright countered that both the email address and computer were not in his possession by that time.  Decryption  Ultimately, Wright’s defense against a contempt charge hinges on his ability to prove that the keys to decryption are beyond his control.  Freedman, for his part, put forward evidence that Wright may be lying about how many different keys are necessary for this task, or that Wright may in fact be in possession of them already.  Wright’s other strategy is seemingly to deflect ownership or custodianship of some of the bitcoin that would presumably be part of his holdings. He accused Freedman of “conflating” bitcoin held in the Tulip Trust with bitcoin held in the Liberty Reserve, a defunct cryptocurrency exchange.  Likewise, Wright later claimed that 821,000 bitcoin were unaccounted for because they were legally represented by a company called Wright International Investments through a convoluted ownership structure that Judge Bruce Reinhardt needed to clarify.  “Is it your position that if you were technologically capable of accessing the necessary information about these Bitcoin, you would still not, under my order, produce that information?... that you don't have to produce anything having to do with these 821,000 Bitcoin because they're not your Bitcoin?,” Reinhardt asked.  It was later shown, at one point at least, that Wright was the sole shareholder of this company.

42382329,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rIkp,1563217342,US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Is 'Not Comfortable' With Facebook's Libra,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin agrees with his boss that crypto is for crooks.  In a press conference Monday, Mnuchin voiced the Trump administration's concerns with Facebook's Libra and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Mnuchin's statements come ahead of two hearings on Capitol Hill this week, in which Facebook blockchain lead David Marcus is expected to testify before both Senate and House lawmakers.  The press conference also follows a series of tweets from President Donald J. Trump last week regarding cryptocurrencies and Libra. At the time, Trump said cryptocurrencies are used in ""unlawful"" activities such as drug trafficking. In a subsequent tweet, Trump said Facebook might have to acquire a banking charter to conduct business with Libra.  While Mnuchin did not make any new policy statements Monday, he did reiterate statements made by various government entities in the past, describing the potential for cryptocurrencies to be used by criminals as one main issue.  ""Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financiers,"" Mnuchin said, using money laundering, terrorist financing, extortion, human trafficking, drug trafficking and tax evasion as examples of crimes that could be facilitated by cryptocurrencies and Libra. He added:  ""This is indeed a national security issue.""  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) will be examining Libra and bitcoin, and will hold any entity that transacts with either ""to the highest standards,"" Mnuchin said.  Mnuchin also referenced the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which published guidance for its member governments on how to regulate cryptocurrency service providers last month. In particular, the FATF guidance recommends enforcing the so-called ""travel rule,"" which requires exchanges and wallet providers to hold know-your-customer information on both sides of each transaction.  After the speech, Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh highlighted that the Treasury Department, which Mnuchin oversees, has offered guidance for how crypto custodians can comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and how it has tried to ""export"" its policies through the FATF.  ""We're going to great lengths to ensure that effective regulation does not stop at our borders,"" Mnuchin said.  Look at Libra  Mnuchin referred to Libra, which Facebook first announced last month, a number of times in the half-hour press conference. Representatives from the social media giant have met with Treasury officials, as well as other government agencies, he said.  So long as Facebook can maintain strict anti-money-laundering standards, there should be no problem with it launching Libra, but Mnuchin said multiple times that the company has much work to do before he will be convinced of its compliance.  Mnuchin said he is ""not comfortable"" with Libra launching at this time.  ""With regard to Facebook's Libra, our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse,"" Mnuchin said.  In response to a question on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more broadly, Mnuchin said he did not know and would not speculate on how or why bitcoin's price might be trading at its current levels.  ""We'll make sure the general public and investors understand what they're investing in and whether it's the SEC or other regulators there [will be] proper disclosures.""

42382322,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rIc1,1563217224,Set Protocol Launches Ethereum Trading Strategy Bots,"Set Labs  , San Francisco-based investment platform, unveiled an Ethereum-based financial trading instrument that captures crypto’s volatile attributes for the investor’s benefit.  The ""Trend Trading ETH 20 Day Simple Moving Average Crossover Set"" uses a two year back-tested “moving average” to capture the momentum of price swings and limit losses in the market.  The ETH Crossover Set uses the ERC20 token to represent user’s funds as either Ether or as Coinbase’s stable USDC. The Set employs two MakerDAO’s ETH/USD price oracle ts to track the daily price and moving average of Ether and is programmed to make trades “whenever the current price of ETH crosses the 20 Day Simple Moving Average indicator.”  If the Set is currently in ETH and the price goes below the moving average, it rebalances ETH into USDC. Likewise, if the Set is currently in ETH and the price goes above the moving average, it rebalances USDC into ETH. “Essentially, you would be momentum investing or swing trading,” said company CEO Felix Feng.  He said:  ""Typically, momentum trading is effective in markets that 1) do not have valuation models, 2) have large amounts of volatility, and 3) have frequent mispricings. Momentum investing is not typically used in US stocks, bonds, or options - as they have clear valuation models (e.g. discounted cash flow analysis for stocks and black Scholes for options). However, for commodities and assets like crypto - momentum trading can be an effective strategy that allows protection from losses in downtrends and capture subside on the uptrends. Based on historical data, this may be an extremely effective strategy - until a valuation model has been figured out.""  As opposed to manually reviewing trend lines and executing trades on a centralized exchanges, or delegating these decisions to a manager of a hedge fund, Set applies technical indicators encoded in smart contracts to remove human decisions from quantitative trades.  A six to twelve hour confirmation period prevents unnecessary trades. Additionally, the protocol is programmed with a minimum rebalance interval of four days.  The moving average is calculated by recording daily prices in a DailyPriceFeed smart contract and taking the average of the past 20 days of price data. The underlying price data is sourced from MakerDAO’s price oracles.  In that sense, the Set is similar to trading bots on exchanges – however, “instead of users setting up trading bot infrastructure, they subscribe to the strategy by acquiring an ERC20 token,” Feng said.  The automated procedure also differentiates it from decentralized finance competitors Melonport and BeToken, which are “similar but operate more as decentralized hedge funds.”  Set Protocol  The company deployed the Set Protocol system to the Ethereum mainnet in April 2019 along with the launch of TokenSets, the dApp, and two trading strategies: Buy and Hold and Range Bound.  Buy and Hold is similar to a traditional index fund, where one Set token is collateralized by multiple underlying assets, in this case BTC and ETH, which automatically rebalance back to a target allocation. Currently, users can invest in an equally weighted or 75/25-percent split strategy.  Range Bound strategies are similar to holding a portfolio of cash and volatile assets represented as a token. It uses Dai as “cash” and either ETH or BTC as a volatile asset.  TokenSets is non-custodial and has approximately 400 unique users representing $430,000 in collateralized assets. It currently does not charge fees.  “Since Sets can be configured to rebalance on any on-chain indicator, we can also build trading strategies built on fundamental indicators and eventually combine multiple indicators to build complex algorithmic strategies,” said Feng. He cited exponential moving averages, relative strength indexes, and moving average convergence divergence.  Set Labs, the company behind Set Protocol, was founded in 2017. It is not yet profitable, but has completed a series seed fundraising of $2 million dollars led by Craft Ventures and Vy Capital with participation from Kindred Ventures, DFJ, Haystack, Social Capital, and angel investor Scott Belsky.

42382323,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rIdH,1563206402,What to Expect When Congress Grills Facebook on Cryptocurrency,"The Takeaway  Congressional hearings on Facebook's Libra project are likely to focus more on the company's privacy failings than on unresolved policy questions for cryptocurrency.  Lawmakers will probably also grill Facebook blockchain lead David Marcus on the company's choice of Switzerland as the home for the Libra Association.  Though Facebook intends to launch Libra next year, regulatory and congressional scrutiny may throw that timeline into jeopardy.  Facebook is about to face the music on Capitol Hill.    In hearings Tuesday and Wednesday, the social media giant will defend its ambitious cryptocurrency project, Libra, which it revealed in June through a white paper and supporting documentation. While Facebook lined up major payments and VC firms to support the project, lawmakers expressed doubts almost immediately, with the U.S. Senate Banking and House Financial Services Committees calling for hearings soon after its unveiling.  The Senate hearing will take place on Tuesday, while the House panel will hold its hearing the next day. David Marcus, Facebook’s blockchain lead, will testify at both. The House hearing, at least, will also call other expert witnesses. Potentially at stake is the timing of Libra's launch. Facebook said last month that it was targeting a 2020 rollout, but whether the company will be able to meet that deadline is still in the air, and not just for technical development reasons. For starters, if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides that Libra resembles an exchange-traded fund (ETF), then Facebook's ability to launch the cryptocurrency will be dependent on the regulator's approval. Congress could also delay Libra's launch: If lawmakers decide they need to have greater oversight on the project, they can try writing and passing a bill (indeed, a draft bill circulating online suggests that some lawmakers are already considering this). Even President Donald J. Trump has criticized Libra, which may indicate that he would be willing to sign such a bill into law. However, if lawmakers come away from the hearings satisfied with Marcus's statements, then Facebook will have passed a major hurdle on its road to launching Libra. Indeed, in his prepared remarks for the Senate hearing, released Monday, Marcus indicated that Facebook would not follow its famous dictum to ""move fast and break things."" ""In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive, and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech’s history,"" Marcus said. ""And I want to be clear: Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.""  Libra, as outlined last month, is designed to be an open-source cryptocurrency that individuals – regardless of whether they’re Facebook users – can send each other for payments. Those who use Libra will be able to send funds using Facebook’s Messenger, WhatsApp or Instagram apps, or other third-party wallets. The company is hoping to provide financial services to unbanked individuals worldwide (though it is not launching in India, the world’s largest market for WhatsApp, where crypto is highly restricted).      Companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Coinbase have all agreed to act as launch partners for the Libra Association, the governing council which will be tasked with overseeing and guiding the project’s technical developments once it is live. However, these partners have signed nonbinding agreements, and do not appear to have paid the $10 million fee to join the association, according to the New York Times.    The backlash to Facebook’s announcement was swift, bipartisan and extremely public. The Senate Banking Committee called a hearing the next day, while members of the House Financial Services Committee have repeatedly called for a moratorium on the cryptocurrency’s development.      Focus on privacy  Past letters and comments by these officials provide hints at what the lawmakers might focus on during the hearings.    The Senate Banking Committee has been looking into Libra since at least May, when chairman Michael Crapo (R.-ID) and ranking member Sherrod Brown (D.-OH) wrote an open letter to Facebook asking several questions about the project.  While the letter overall was about the crypto project, many of the questions specifically focused on issues of consumer financial data collection and user privacy in Facebook's flagship business.  Crapo also wrote an opinion piece in Fox News this month, emphasizing the importance of data privacy, and suggesting how lawmakers might be able to aid in securing this privacy as a legal right.  Facebook responded to the committee’s questions last week, assuring lawmakers that the company would not hold any personal financial data, though its Calibra subsidiary would collect any and all know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) information that is required by law.  Marcus, who wrote the response, also told lawmakers that because Libra’s code will be open-source, anyone could build their own wallets. These third-party developers would be responsible for any data that their wallets collect, as well as ensuring compliance with any relevant statutes.  Kristin Smith, head of the Blockchain Association, a lobbying group, told CoinDesk that “given the recent turmoil surrounding Facebook and the general shift in perspective on Big Tech in D.C., it’s natural that Facebook itself would be getting the majority of the focus from lawmakers, rather than the specifics of the Libra project.”  However, she believes this is “a missed opportunity.”  “We … would rather see this moment used to answer long-standing questions about U.S. crypto policy, no matter what you think of Facebook’s recent history,” she said, adding:  “There are some overlapping regulatory issues facing traditional crypto companies and Libra, though we think the latter needs its own consideration from lawmakers as part of a broader discussion of public policy in the U.S.” Indeed, House Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters (D.-CA) and ranking member Patrick McHenry (R.-NC), in their own statements questioning the project, also indicated that their concerns lie more with Facebook than with the cryptocurrency itself.  “With the announcement that it plans to create a cryptocurrency, Facebook is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of users,” Waters said last month. On the other hand, there is a wild card, in the form of House committee member Brad Sherman, who has repeatedly called for an outright ban on crypto activities in the U.S. and may take the opportunity to bash the asset class again on Wednesday.  Swiss setup  User data collection aside, another apparent cause for alarm seems to come from the fact that Facebook set up a subsidiary in Switzerland, ostensibly to develop hardware or software, as well as to provide financial and technology services.  Lawmakers appear to believe that Facebook might have established a subsidiary in Switzerland to skirt U.S. regulations.  Brown tweeted last month that “we cannot allow Facebook to run a risky new cryptocurrency out of a Swiss bank account without oversight.”  Smith had another interpretation, however. She told CoinDesk that Facebook may have chosen to set up shop in Switzerland because of a lack of clarity around U.S. regulations.  “It’s no secret that Switzerland is well-known as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction,” she said, adding:  “The pervasive regulatory uncertainty is having a dampening effect on U.S.-based companies and investors, which could have played a role in Facebook’s decision, no matter what the merits of Switzerland’s laws may be on their own.”  In that context, “it is striking that Facebook decided against basing this project in the U.S.,” she said.  If the U.S. legal and regulatory structure is not clarified, she expects other projects might also follow suit in leaving the country for other jurisdictions.  Companies based in the U.S. may even consider moving to another country in search of this clarity.  “If regulators and lawmakers, who have to this point focused mainly on the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, instead supported the positive growth potential of the industry as other countries have done, the U.S. may be able to lead the growth of this economy for decades to come,” Smith said. But Marcus' prepared remarks suggest he thinks the lawmakers are thinking defensively rather than offensively. For example, he downplayed the potential threat to fiat currencies posed by Libra, reassuring the Senators:  ""The Libra Association, which will manage the Reserve [of assets backing the coin], has no intention of competing with any sovereign currencies or entering the monetary policy arena. It will work with the Federal Reserve and other central banks to make sure Libra does not compete with sovereign currencies or interfere with monetary policy. Monetary policy is properly the province of central banks.""

42382331,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rIjZ,1563199852,Japan Creates Working Group to Discuss Facebook Libra Ahead of G7 Meeting,"Japan has set up a working group to examine the issues raised by the potential launch of Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency project.  The group, which started meeting last week, comprises the nation's central bank, the Ministry of Finance and the Financial Services Agency, a top finance regulator, Reuters reported on Saturday.  The agencies will use the opportunity to discuss the potential ramifications of Libra on fiscal policy, financial regulation, tax and payments ahead of a meeting of the G7 nations' finance chiefs on July 17-18 in Chantilly, France, the report said.  With France – which currently holds the G7 presidency– having already moved to set up a task force to look at cryptocurrencies including Libra, the coming meeting will put the issue high on the agenda.  When the task force formation was announced in late June, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the French central bank, said the body would be led by European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure and would examine at how cryptocurrencies are regulated to avoid money laundering and other problems.  However, Facebook's crypto was criticized by France's finance and economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, last month over concerns that Libra might grow to replace traditional currencies. At the time, he called for the G7 central bank governors to draw up a report on Facebook’s project for the July meeting.  “It is out of question’’ that Libra be allowed “become a sovereign currency,” Le Maire said at the time. “It can’t and it must not happen.”  Coeure is expected to present a preliminary report on the matter at the Chantilly meeting, Reuters said.  Facebook is also facing heavy scrutiny in the U.S. this week as two congressional committees are holding hearings to question Facebook over the Libra project, amid calls from lawmakers in the nation to freeze the project until more can be determined about its potential benefits and risks.  In characteristic style, President Donald Trump also slated the project in tweets last week. Trump said Libra “will have little standing or dependability” and suggested should apply for a banking license and comply with relevant rules if its aim is to become a bank.  More generally, the president also tweeted he is “not a fan” of cryptocurrencies, adding that they are “not money.”  Japanese Ministry of Finance image via Shutterstock  Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that Bruno Le Maire is France's finance and economy minister, not its foreign minister.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/15/japan-creates-working-group-to-discuss-facebook-libra-ahead-of-g7-meeting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a58fdb0e1ed7b50b650fbcf75a433a4446e3215-1500x875.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced on Sunday and reported by CoinDesk Korea, the other founding firms include mobile carriers SK Telecom, LG Yuplus and KT, two banks – KEB Han and Wooriand – and government-founded securities infrastructure provider Koscom.  The service will provide a ""self-sovereign"" authentication solution that does away with middlemen services and allows users to verify their identity or qualifications over a blockchain, keeping more control of their own personal information. Individuals can store their data on a smart device and submit only the data they choose when certification is required.  Tech-wise, the deal will see the firms develop the service based around a consortium blockchain model, with participating companies operating network nodes using their own servers.  The system will see a beta test by the end of 2019 and a decision on whether to commercialize the offering will be made in the next year, the report says.  Initially, the service will be applied to the issuance and distribution of graduation and other certificates from major universities in Korea, as well as to Koscom's platform for unlisted startup stocks.  A plan is being considered for the three telcos to use the system for their career recruitment process.  Mobile ID certification is expected to simplify the issuance and submission of various certificates and help companies ensure the digital have not been falsified – all in real time.  Ultimately, the firms indicated they may expand the service to other areas by encouraging more companies to participate, with potential use cases across digital signatures, user authentication for telecom and banking, healthcare and insurance certification, and club memberships.  Notarization, proof of content and online logins were also listed as potential areas that could be addressed by the network.  At a signing of a joint venture agreement in Seoul on July 12, one of the participants said (via informal translation):  ""The participating companies plan to establish a strategy so that the mobile electronic certification can be used in various industrial fields, and plan the operation so that it becomes a service that creates social value in the long term.""

42382341,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rIxP,1563190813,Bitcoin’s Price Could Rise if Facebook’s Crypto Survives Congress Hearings,"Bitcoin has come under pressure ahead of the U.S. governmental hearings on Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency on July 16 and 17.  The price of a single bitcoin, which stood near $13,000 five days ago, fell below $10,000 earlier today and tested the 50-day moving average at $9,900 for the first time since February 18.  Facebook’s head of Calibra – one of the entities set up to govern and develop the crypto project – David Marcus is scheduled testify to lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.  The upcoming scrutiny of Libra may be weighing over bitcoin. After all, past data shows BTC tends to drop ahead of congressional hearings related to cryptocurrencies and rise on favorable outcomes.  Last year, for instance, BTC fell from $6,820 to $6,070 in five days to July 12, before rallying to $7,400 on July 18 when the House Committee on Financial Services gathered for a hearing on “crypto as a new form of money”.  More importantly, the cryptocurrency remained bid in the following days and rose to a high of $8,500 on July 24 (according to Bitstamp data) because the hearing didn't take an overly negative tone.  On similar lines, BTC dropped from $12,000 to $6,000 in the 10 days leading up to a congressional hearing on Feb. 6, 2018, where the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman and the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission testified before the Senate Banking Committee. That hearing was also surprisingly positive and BTC rose back to levels above $11,700 by Feb. 20.  Going further back, the price action seen ahead of bitcoin’s first congressional hearing on Nov. 18, 2013, was slightly different in the sense that the cryptocurrency was solidly bid, rising from $85 to $650 in six weeks leading up to the event.  Again the hearing on the growing popularity of virtual currencies wasn’t anti-crypto, allowing BTC to extend the rally to highs above $1,150 on Nov. 30.  Will BTC rise this time round?  Facebook’s fiat and government bond backed cryptocurrency Libra is widely considered a net positive for bitcoin, an anti-establishment asset.  This is evident from the fact that BTC rallied from $9,000 to $13,800 in the eight days following Facebook’s unveiling of Libra’s white paper on June 18.  So, it is hardly surprising that the leading cryptocurrency is feeling the pull of gravity ahead of the congressional hearings on Libra and will likely take a hit if the U.S. lawmakers throw a spanner in the works for Facebook.  It is worth noting that the likes of the Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell have already called for a halt to Facebook’s project until concerns from privacy to money laundering are addressed. President Trump also criticized the project in tweets last week.  BTC, however, may rise well past $13,800 and possibly hit record highs before the end of the third quarter if the hearings are more optimistic.  A far as the technical charts are concerned, the short-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices hold above $9,614 (July 2 low).  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,300 on Bitstamp, representing 4.86 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily and 3-day charts  A UTC close below $9,614 would invalidate the bullish higher-lows pattern and confirm a bullish-to-bearish trend change.  That looks likely with the three-day chart reporting a bearish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI). The indicator has also dived out of the ascending trendline, signaling the end of the rally from December lows.  Further, the previous three-candle closed well below the 10-candle moving average, a level which acted as strong support throughout the rise from $3,500 to $13,880, as discussed on Friday.  Weekly chart  The long upper wicks attached to two out of the last three candles indicates bullish exhaustion and so does the bearish divergence of the RSI.  All-in-all, the charts are biased for a drop to $9,097 (May 30 high), unless the congressional hearings are more positive than expected. In that case, prices may rise above $13,800, signaling a continuation of the rally.  Hourly chart  BTC has recovered from lows near $9,850 to $10,300. The bearish lower-highs pattern, however, is still intact. Prices may rise to $11,200 in the next 24 hours if the cryptocurrency invalidates the bearish lower highs pattern with a move above $10,732.

In such a development, the invention would disrupt the traditional card system based on three intermediaries: the credit card company, a value-added network (VAN) service provider and a payment gateway.  ""We obtained the patent about a year and a half after we initiated a feasibility study including technology reviews."" the official said.

Shinhan Card is now seeking to expand the credit patent to Europe, the U.S., Japan, China, Vietnam and Indonesia, they added.  Earlier this year, sister firm Shinhan Bank said it was using blockchain technology to speed up the approval process for loan products.

42403078,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeXX6,1563163258,What Trump's Bitcoin Tweet Changes,"Let’s be clear: It was not the substance of Donald Trump’s tweet that made his critique of bitcoin and Libra so important last week.  It should be of no surprise that this US President would declare himself “not a fan” of “highly volatile” cryptocurrencies “based on thin air” that “facilitate unlawful behavior” or that he much prefers a “dependable and reliable” currency “called the United States Dollar!”  (Anyone who assumed Trump would be a ""drain-the-swamp"" libertarian advocate for censorship-resistant money had an ill-informed view of a man whose government is stacked with former Wall Street execs, who opposes free trade and immigration, and takes a draconian approach to a variety of civil rights and social liberties.)  What matters is the very fact that a sitting president mentioned cryptocurrencies at all. Indeed, from a price perspective, Trump’s disparaging remarks are, on balance, positive for bitcoin. By Friday evening, the post-tweet price action reflected that.  More importantly, the tweet marks a symbolic milestone in the gradual but ever-expanding presence that cryptocurrency occupies in the public conversation around money and policy.  It also marks the starting point in a titanic battle over the shape of our global money system.  Publicity you can’t buy  Why is a Trump tweet-shame positive for bitcoin’s price? Well, bitcoin must stay relevant to succeed, and this was, at the very least, an acknowledgement from the halls of power of its relevance.  By simply giving it the time of day, Trump revealed that people within the high levels of the U.S. power structure are noticing the challenge that cryptocurrency technology poses to it.  Also important: the tweet came shortly after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, one of the U.S. President’s favorite punching bags, had described bitcoin, in Senate testimony, not as a payments vehicle but as “an alternative to gold…a store of value...a speculative store of value.”  Powell wasn’t saying that he saw bitcoin as gold-like per se; it was a reference to how most bitcoin’s users currently treat it and, in that sense, he was simply stating a fact. Still, it gave some legitimacy to bitcoin’s claim to be the digital-era replacement of that ancient store of value.  And if we think of how gold has been used during the fiat currency era – as protection against the political risks inherent in national currencies – then this one-two punch could hardly be better for those arguing that bitcoin should play that role in the 21st century.  Think about it: they got the most powerful central banker in the world to describe bitcoin in such terms. Soon after, a self-interested politician who occupies the world’s most powerful government post demonstrated why you might want such protection.  Amplifying the Narrative  All of this comes within the context of the announcement last month of the Facebook-sponsored blockchain and cryptocurrency project, Libra.  As was inevitable when a powerful and contentious company launches a radical new idea, Libra’s arrival has massively amplified what I like to call the “narrative economy” in which cryptocurrencies thrive.  With its potential global clout drawing on Facebook’s 2.7 billion user base, Libra is forcing people – corporate leaders, bankers and, most importantly, government leaders – to think and talk about cryptocurrencies. It’s what prompted the question to Powell from Mike Crapo, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and it was the main focus of the Fed Chairman’s reply. And it’s clearly what inspired Trump to take to Twitter, given that his three-tweet post included a line saying that Libra “will have little standing or dependability” and would need to seek a banking charter if it is to operate.  Let’s not forget, either, that this comes right before next week’s hearings on Libra called by House Financial Services Committee, called by its Chair, Maxine Waters, who has warned that Facebook’s project cannot be allowed to compete with the dollar.  That there’s alignment between Trump and Waters on an issue is itself historic. But it also hints at the power battle at play. The mounting conversation is about the structure of our financial system and about the dominance of the intermediaries that manage that system: banks, deeply integrated as they are into our system of government, money and power.  As gatekeepers of the dominant fiat currency system, banks – and, by extension, the political leaders who determine how to regulate them – can make it harder for people to use both decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and corporate-backed private currencies such as Libra. Trump’s tweet, with a high degree of specificity, looked suspiciously as if it had been drafted by someone with interests in the banking sector.  But putting a lid on all this won’t be easy for governments. Most cryptocurrencies, whether bitcoin or Libra, are based on open-source software. Can those governments ban the software? Technically yes, but how will they globally coordinate around that effort, how would they stop it?  As it is, many central banks suddenly seem to be adopting the “if you can’t beat them, join them” strategy. The government-owned China Daily reported this week that China was accelerating its plans to produce a digital currency. That came a week after Agustin Carstens, chief of the Bank of International Settlements, said central banks would introduce digital currencies “sooner than we think.” It was a remarkable about-face from someone who had months earlier told cryptocurrency coders to “stop trying to create money,” and dismissed any value in central bank digital currencies.  Probably more important, right around the time of the Libra announcement last month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney dropped a bombshell, saying that the BOE would provide funds to tech companies, an apparent move to spearhead fintech development in London at a time when Brexit has threatened the banking industry. The opening poses a huge opportunity for Libra and other stablecoins to provide new “narrow banking” payment services.  Things are poised to get mighty confusing, in other words, with private corporate currencies, decentralized cryptocurrencies and government-run digital currencies all competing for primacy in the world of money. Thank to Libra – but really, thanks to bitcoin before it – the narrative economy around monetary innovation is getting seriously amplified.  Communities of stories  As the noise level rises, more and more people will inquire and explore alternatives to mainstream currencies such as bitcoin. They’ll also grapple with the opportunities, risks and the disruptive challenges such a choice poses.  Essentially, a giant, collective storytelling exercise has been pushed into overdrive. Stories have always driven the adoption of new ideas, building the connective emotional tissue upon which social networks and communities are formed around them. And that, in turn – the development of a community around a shared idea – is ultimately what underpins a currency.  Trump, who with his 62 million Twitter followers arguably has a broadcasting power greater than any news network, is contributing to this collective storytelling exercise. Perhaps he’s the foil character, standing in opposition to the HODLers and “To the Moon” crypto enthusiasts, but even in that role he is driving the narrative – essentially by fueling resistance, by encouraging his opponents to counter with counte-rarguments and, of course, memes.  Which brings us to the other factor ensuring that Trump’s tweet, more than any other statement by a government official, will prove to be instrumental in driving buzz and bluster around this topic: Twitter itself.  Twitter is not only the President’s favorite vehicle for communicating with the public, it also represents the most important segment of crypto’s narrative economy. If ever there were a community prepared to respond to those three short posts, it was Crypto Twitter, which immediately responded with its special mix of snark, humor and passion.  God knows where all this goes. But one thing’s for certain: the cryptocurrency carnival just got wilder.

42403057,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeXGN,1563160240,US May Bar Large Tech Firms From Issuing Cryptocurrencies,"Lawmakers in the U.S. are discussing a bill that seeks to prevent large technology institutions in the country from issuing cryptocurrencies.  According to a report from Reuters on Monday and a copy of the draft bill circulating online, policymakers in the U.S. House of Representatives are looking to step up their scrutiny over big tech firms that are interested in cryptocurrencies.  Under the section of ""Prohibition related to cryptocurrencies,"" the draft bill, called ""Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act,"" states:  ""A large platform utility may not establish, maintain, or operate a digital asset that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.""  The bill specifically defines a digital asset as ""an asset that is issued and transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology, including, so-called 'virtual currencies,' 'coins,' and 'tokens.'""  It further clarifies any large tech firm with over $25 billion in global annual revenue could fall into this category and any violation of the proposed regulation should be subject to a fine of ""not more than $1 million per each day of such violation.""  While the bill is still in a discussion draft form and not yet formally submitted, the news comes just weeks after Facebook announced a plan to issue the Libra cryptocurrency on a blockchain. The firm booked $55 billion in revenue for 2018. Worldwide regulators have since then voiced concerns on how Facebook's plan can remain compliant with financial regulations across the globe.  Last week, the U.S. president Donald Trump made his first comments on cryptocurrencies via a series of tweets, in which he criticized Facebook’s Libra project had ""little standing or dependability.""

42403076,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeXZ4,1563151439,Below $10K: Bitcoin Price Drops $1.4K in 24 Hours to Hit 2-Week Low,"The cryptocurrency markets fell sharply on July 14 after bitcoin (BTC) endured another $1,400 sell-off, denying the bulls a chance to revisit 2019 highs.  At 09:00 UTC on July 14, BTC began to shed $1400 from its price tag, dropping below $11,000 and then $10,500 for the first time since July 2.  Prices had initially attempted to rally above $10,800 but were stopped short as a quick reversal to momentum brought prices reeling back below $10,000.  BTC’s price has since fallen victim to the continual bearish sell-off and is currently changing hands at $9,974 at time of writing.  The move down was also accompanied by a small surge in total trading volume of $2.8 billion over a 24 hours as traders looked to book profit and exit the markets in quick succession amid declining crypto prices across the board, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Major names such as ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), XRP (XRP) and EOS (EOS) also began to fall in value at around the same time as BTC, losing between 15-20 percent in just under six hours.  Further, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined endured a $20.1 billion loss over 24 hours, marking one of the largest single-day losses in market value since June 27, 2019.  The short term outlook remains volatile, so BTC could experience a bounce on today’s momentum, but that will need to be accompanied by strong levels in growing (bullish) volume in order to end the recent sell-off still being felt from July 10.
