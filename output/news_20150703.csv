42378232,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N1Rj,1435943120,Bitcoin in the Headlines: More Hot Air for Greece,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at bitcoin news, analysing media coverage and its impact.  This week was by no means the first time the mainstream media has connected Greece's looming debt crisis to bitcoin.  As the country gets to grips with the controversial bailout referendum that will decide the country's future in the eurozone this Sunday, the media has taken its coverage of the digital currency to a whole new level. At the time of publication, a quick Google news search resulted in over 100 articles.  Given the country's cashflow restrictions and bank closures, journalists have taken to explore bitcoin's potential in Greece.  CoinDesk has taken a look at the top bitcoin related headlines from across the globe.  Wooing the Greeks  A regular on the bitcoin weekly scene, Fortune's Daniel Roberts wrote a piece which highlighted the ways in which bitcoin companies were trying to attract the attention of Greeks.  ""As their country's financial system collapses, Greek citizens are desperate to access their money. And vocal businesspeople elsewhere in the world are eager to inform them that they have another option: bitcoin,"" he said.  Roberts noted Coinbase had waived transactions fees for euro purchases made until 5th July – coinciding with the date of the referendum – in an attempt to encourage bitcoin purchases.  Accurately, however, Roberts pointed out ""leading Greeks to the digital currency isn't so simple"".  He continued:  ""Right now, in fact, there are very few ways for anyone in Greece to even obtain bitcoins. Their banks are closed for a week; their ATMs are limiting them to withdrawing €60 per day; and as of Tuesday, they cannot use Greek credit or debit cards for online transactions. That means they can't even take Coinbase up on its offer.""  It seemed that bitcoin was doomed to remain untouched, despite the efforts of companies operating within the space.  However, Fred Ehrsam, cofounder and president at Coinbase, cited in the article, said the company's motive was to appeal to Europeans who are not in Greece.  ""There's little that [bitcoin companies] can do for people on the ground in Greece. The bigger deal here is if you're sitting in Italy, Spain, or Portugal, and you're getting a little nervous, maybe it makes more sense to put value into bitcoin where you're less susceptible to these things. The doomsday way of saying it would be, 'Do it before it's too late'.""  After all, Spain, Portugal and Italy are also familiar with the consequences of external debt.  Bitcoin vs gold    There is no doubt that Greece is struggling, but why are its citizens not turning to one of the oldest forms of money – gold?      That's exactly what CNBC's Brian Kelly questioned in a piece titled ""Greece is in crisis – why no love for gold?""      The precious metal will remain unloved because this is a political crisis, not a currency crisis, he said. ""The primary reason you buy the ""barbarous relic"" that is gold is fear of a global currency crisis.""      Kelly is right. The onset of the Global Financial Crisis and the rapidly declining stock markets triggered a stampede of gold purchases between 2007 and 2008.      He added:      ""In Greece, citizens and investors are not concerned about having a currency to use; the only unknown is which currency they will adopt or create. Currently, the Greek citizens have a currency, the euro, but using it is next to impossible with the banks closed.""            According to Kelly, gold is only useful in the aftermath of a complete currency collapse. For this reason, he believes the precious metal will remain untouched as long as there is a viable alternative. ""Gold is both useful and valuable — just not in a political crisis.""  Political crisis  Although there is no denying that Greece is feeling the widespread effects of an economic crisis, outlets across the world joined Kelly, noting the crisis was as much political as it was economic.  The BBC headlined a piece ""Politics trumps economics in Greek debt crisis' and Channel 4's Paul Mason exposed a similar viewpoint in a piece titled ""Greece crisis: a failure of economics in the face of politics"".  Additionally to high youth unemployment rates, Greece's public debt currently stands at a staggering 177% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP); the highest in the European Union.  Despite explaining his sources had not verified a surge of bitcoin buying attributable to Greece, Kelly said that this did not mean that the Greek crisis was unrelated to the recent price spike.  ""That is not to say that Greece is not the reason for the recent rise in bitcoin – it is. Speculators have been buying up bitcoin as a safe-haven alternative asset – more specifically an asset that trades 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is out of reach of government decrees on bank closures or bail-ins.""  According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the digital currency experienced a relatively small increase in value, spiking to $266.15 on 30th June.  Since then, bitcoin's price has declined, hovering around the $250 mark at the time of press. This tiny price movement would have gone unnoticed any other day in the digital currency's volatile history, however it seems to have captivated the imagination of the press today.  More talk than walk  Marketwatch's Francine McKenna added to the debate with a piece titled ""For Greece, bitcoin is more talk than a reality"".    The journalist cited Antonis Polemitis, managing director of New York-based Ledra Capital and an instructor in the first master of science degree in digital currency at the University of Nicosia in Cyprus.    He told McKenna:  ""However, Greece has a low adoption rate for bitcoin and it is too late now for anyone other than the previously converted to take advantage of its functionality for this crisis.""  The journalist continued to note that the country's low bitcoin adoption rate is a function both of interest and aptitude. ""Its access to the euro is an advantage for a citizenry that craves a stable, easily convertible currency. Even if the country were to revert to its patrimonial currency, drachmas, Greek citizens will probably still rely on euros since, as citizens of Europe, their lives and economy are tied up with their neighbours.""  According to Mckenna's piece, the digital currency's adoption is still limited to tech savvy citizens who may want a practical, rather than a political, alternative to what is perceived to be a unstable global banking system.  Citing George Papageorgiou, a faculty member on the University of Nicosia’s digital currency MSc program, the article noted:  ""The financially unsophisticated, the elderly, and those too stressed to take the time and spend the money to get established will continue to find bitcoin a logistically difficult alternative.""  However, Kelly still sees potential for the digital currency to thrive in Greece:  ""An asset unencumbered by political crisis that can be used as a medium of exchange at over 100,000 merchants is just ONE of the many use cases for bitcoin and block-chain technology,"" he concluded.  Whether bitcoin will help Greece in its time of need remains to be seen. One thing is for certain, the Greeks are quickly running out of options. Banks remain closed and just yesterday, Shelly Banjo, a Quartz journalist, reported PayPal was no longer in the country, shutting its population off from online payments.

42378221,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N1Dt,1435935648,BNP Paribas: Blockchains Will Destroy or Rebuild Securities Services,"Blockchain technology will bring either doom or opportunity to securities services firms, according to European banking giant BNP Paribas.  Writing in the bank's magazine, Quintessence, research analyst Johann Palychata said the bank forecasts two scenarios: ""total disruption"" or new, improved services for the institutions who handle the world's trades.  He added:  ""In its purest form, a distributed blockchain system allows all market participants direct access to the DSD (Decentralised Securities Depositary), to the exchange and to the post-trade infrastructure (clearing & settlement). If this setup develops then existing industry players might be redundant.""  Despite this disruptive potential, investors may still require institutions to hold their private keys, due to the difficulty of protecting them. These same custodians may launch their own network or provide an application layer on top of the blockchain, he added.  In the alternative outcome put forward by the bank, industry players will integrate blockchain technology as part of their ""next generation of IT infrastructure"". This means they will remain in control, with only authorised market participants able to record and track trades on the ledger.  ""They may deploy new services that they could not in the past because the investments required were a huge barrier to entry,"" he added.  Post-trade  One startup banking on the ""total disruption"" of the 'post-trade' ecosystem – where ownership is transferred from buyer to seller after a trade – is Digital Asset Holdings, which uses distributed ledger technologies to settle digitised and non-digitised assets.  Helmed by ex-JP Morgan executive Blythe Masters, the firm recently acquired two startups, Hyperledger and Bits of Proof, in its quest to siphon volume from firms like the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which clears $1.6 quadrillion annually.  One of the world's top custodians, BNP Paribas Group offers securities services to its 13,000 corporate and institutional clients across 57 countries. The bank, which also offers retail services, is active in 75 countries worldwide, reporting $39.2bn in revenue for 2014.  In an interview with The Banker this week, Philippe Denis, chief digital officer of the bank's securities services, revealed the company had run brainstorming sessions around blockchain technology for 40 of its employees.  BNP Paribas is currently developing ""a handful"" of test cases for its operations across custody, fund administration and transfer agency, he said, adding:  ""A lot of the process that one associates with the current network model can disappear. You could make do without a central securities depositary.""

42378230,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N1PD,1435929575,Kleiner Perkins: Blockchain Tech Will Spawn Amazon-Sized Successes,"As one of the oldest and most established venture capital firms in the US, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), has had a helping hand in mainstreaming technologies from IT to biotech since its founding in 1972.  While Kleiner Perkins hasn't yet invested in a bitcoin or blockchain company, it's likely it will soon do so via its newest fund, KPCB Edge. The seed-stage investment firm, announced 16th June and launched with a $4m budget, will have blockchain technology as one of its six core areas of focus.  Leading KPCB's exploration will be founding partner Anjney Midha, the firm's youngest partner and a former Google policy fellow. In a recent Medium post, Midha explained his interest in the blockchain, bitcoin's underlying decentralized ledger, heralding the technology's strong increase in developer adoption, which he contrasted against the decline in the price of bitcoin.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Midha expanded on his investment thesis for the technology, indicating that he believes the bitcoin blockchain and other blockchain protocols will become invisible to end users while enabling faster, cheaper and more secure payments.  He said:  ""I see the bitcoin blockchain as an implementation of blockchain technology – so I'm interested in both the generalizable stack, as well as any specific implementations that see developer adoption.""  The firm's new interest in blockchain technologies is notable given the company's history of strategic bets in early Internet companies such as Amazon, Google and Netscape, a connection that further highlights the perceived parallels between the technologies.  When asked if he believed startups working on the blockchain would produce similar success stories, Midha answered:  ""We wouldn't be focused on this space if we didn't believe that.""  Value creation  Midha reiterated the views he expressed in an KPCB Edge blog post, suggesting developer adoption is perhaps the most important metric in evaluating opportunities in the current bitcoin ecosystem.  ""Historically, the combination of a new platform’s capabilities and rapid developer adoption has produced significant value for users,"" he wrote. ""Take the case, for example, of the mobile stack between 2008–2015. Incredible value was created with each new capability developers could access on mobile.""  This increase in developer interest, he argued, was key to the creation of notable startups from Whatsapp to Waze.  Midha drew a parallel between the underlying technologies that propelled these apps to recent tech advances that enable distributed, programmable contracts on top of the bitcoin blockchain.  Going forward, Midha expressed his enthusiasm for further infrastructure development, labelling micropayment channels as another ""interesting use case"" that has emerged around the technology.  Multi-tiered approach  Though KPCB Edge will primarily place small strategic investments of $250,000 in select projects, Midha hinted this strategy likely wouldn't suffice on its own.  When asked if KPCB might consider entering into larger Series B or Series C rounds for veteran industry companies, Midha said a single strategy isn't ""necessarily the best"".  ""Seed is one strategy,"" he continued. ""It's where I believe the Edge team can have the most impact. For later companies, KPCB has larger funds and separate teams that are focused on those rounds.""  Midha further hinted a hybrid investment strategy could be put in place by the company, noting KPCB works with founders at every stage, regardless of the industry.  Backslash selection  Midha also expanded on his firm's selection of Backslash founder Roneil Rumburg to the staff of the new venture, noting his experience with bitcoin and the blockchain was a specific factor in his selection.  ""Rumberg worked with the bitcoin stack as a founder less than 12 months ago. Few other VCs have this timely and technically rigorous background when it comes to blockchains,"" he said, adding:  ""This allows him to both empathize with and think critically about founders in this space.""  Rumberg's background as a developer was also mentioned, with Midha referring to him as a ""crack full-stack engineer"" with the technology that could play a valuable role in vetting projects.  As such, KPCB Edge is currently accepting applications for new startups in the blockchain industry.
