42397381,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Aey,1393795319,"UK Eliminates Tax on Bitcoin Trading, Publishes Official Guidance","UPDATE (3rd February, 17:19 GMT): HMRC has now published an official brief, outlining its position on the tax treatment of income derived from bitcoin-related activities.  _____________________________  The UK's tax agency has reversed an earlier ruling that classified virtual currencies as gift vouchers, exempting digital currency trading from a 20% value added tax (VAT).  HM Revenue and Customs  (HMRC), the UK's customs and tax department, has classified virtual currencies as assets or private money, not as vouchers that required a tax on the value of the coins.  Tom Robinson, co-founder of London-based digital currency storage specialist Elliptic and a director of the soon-to-launch industry group U.K. Digital Currency Association, lauded the decision by the tax agency, telling CoinDesk:  ""I think this is the most progressive treatment of cryptocurrencies in the world. This is the most forward thinking and comprehensive advice in regards to taxation.""  HMRC had previously indicated it would consider rethinking its treatment of digital currency in December.  Reports say  other taxes would still apply to businesses that buy, sell or exchange bitcoin. However, notably, bitcoin businesses will not be charged a tax on margins.  The news follows reports that the UK's Payments Council, the organisation that sets strategy for payments, is assessing digital currencies, and amid increasing innovation from the local community that has seen the opening of bitcoin ATM alternatives and release of physical bitcoin price tags.  HMRC outlines new position in brief  In its formal Revenue & Customs Brief, published on Monday, the HMRC pointed out that for VAT purposes bitcoin and other digital currencies will be treated as follows.  Income received from bitcoin mining activities will generally be outside the scope of VAT. This is due to the fact that mining does not constitute an economic activity for VAT purposes, as there is an insufficient link between any services provided and any consideration received.  Income received by miners for other activities, such as for the provision of services in connection with the verification of specific transactions for which specific charges are made, will be exempt from VAT under Article 135(1)(d) of the EU VAT Directive as falling within the definition of 'transactions, including negotiation, concerning deposit and current accounts, payments, transfers, debts, cheques and other negotiable instruments.'  When bitcoin is exchanged for Sterling or for foreign currencies, such as Euros or Dollars, no VAT will be due on the value of the bitcoins themselves.  Charges (in whatever form) made over and above the value of the Bitcoin for arranging or carrying out any transactions in Bitcoin will be exempt from VAT under Article 135(1)(d) as outlined at 2 above.  With VAT out of the way, the HMRC turned to Corporation Tax, Income Tax and Capital gains Tax. It is important to note that there is no clear rule that applies to all activities and organisations. The brief explains:  ""Each case will be considered on the basis of its own individual facts and circumstances. The relevant legislation and case law will be applied to determine the correct tax treatment. Therefore, depending on the facts, a transaction may be so highly speculative that it is not taxable or any losses relievable.""  Businesses which accept payment in bitcoins will see no change in the way revenue is recognised and how taxable profits are calculated:  Corporation Tax: The profits or losses on exchange movements between currencies are taxable. For the tax treatment of virtual currencies, the general rules on foreign exchange and loan relationships apply. We have not at this stage identified any need to consider bespoke rules.  For companies, exchange movements are determined between the company’s functional currency (usually the currency in which the accounts are prepared) and the other currency in question. If there is an exchange rate between Bitcoin and the functional currency then this analysis applies. Therefore no special tax rules for Bitcoin transactions are required. The profits and losses of a company entering into transactions involving Bitcoin would be reflected in accounts and taxable under normal Corporation Tax rules.  Income Tax: The profits and losses of a non-incorporated business on Bitcoin transactions must be reflected in their accounts and will be taxable on normal income tax rules.  Chargeable gains - Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax: If a profit or loss on a currency contract is not within trading profits or otherwise within the loan relationship rules, it would normally be taxable as a chargeable gain or allowable as a loss for Corporation Tax or Capital Gains Tax purposes. Gains and losses incurred on Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are chargeable or allowable for Capital Gains Tax if they accrue to an individual or, for Corporation Tax on chargeable gains if they accrue to a company.  An open dialogue  Elliptic and other UK-based bitcoin businesses had earlier contacted the HMRC in an attempt to inspire UK lawmakers to rethink their classification of bitcoin, suggesting that the VAT would discourage UK consumers from investing in the ecosystem and make it harder for domestic companies to compete globally.  The result, however, was that HMRC opened up discussions with the community.  Robinson indicates that in early meetings, UK lawmakers asked questions about various digital currency activities, such as mining, though the larger focus was the overall taxation of the new currencies.  Impact  The news spread quickly across the bitcoin community, with many lauding it as a validation of bitcoin at a time when the industry is in need of good news.  Further, though undeniably positive, others in the community suggested that still more work needs to be done to ensure the growth of digital currencies in the UK.  The news is notable as most recent regulatory statements in the wake of operational issues at the now-bankrupt Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox had been trending negative. Vietnam became the latest to speak out against bitcoin this week, citing Mt. Gox specifically, though over the last month, a slew of countries - from Hungary to Cyprus to Kazakhstan - have all issued warnings.

42397372,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4AW7,1393775766,Will Florida’s Money Laundering Laws Apply to Bitcoin?,"Lawyers for the two men recently arrested in Miami for engaging in “too-large” bitcoin transactions are claiming that the men’s actions were legal because state law covers only money issued by the US or another country.  Many in the bitcoin community are hopeful that this argument is persuasive, seeing money laundering laws as an attempt to regulate thoughtcrime in finance. Others also argue that citizens do not currently owe the state of Florida any kind of explanation for why they want to buy or sell bitcoin.  Sting operation  In what may be the first instance of citizens being charged under state law for buying or selling bitcoin, Pascal Reid, 29, and Michell Abner Espinoza, 30, were charged on 6th February with money laundering and engaging in an unlicensed money-servicing business.  The two were contacted by undercover officers who were looking to exchange $30,000 dollars each for bitcoin, an amount that violates the state’s money laundering laws.  Those laws makes exchanges above $10,000 illegal without offering information to the government. The state also forbids frequent unlicensed transactions of more than $300 but less than $20,000 in any 12-month period.  However, Reid’s attorney, Ron Lowy, argues that “the language of the Florida statutes excludes and was never intended to cover bitcoins.”  It appears that, despite this, undercover police officers were conducting stings which were aimed at netting “individuals engaged in high volume bitcoin activity,” according to Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle.  Contrasting views  The prosecutor’s office claims that “bitcoins are often seen as a perfect means of laundering dirty money or for buying and selling illegal goods, such as drugs or stolen credit card information.”  Bitcoin is far from an ideal, or even particularly popular, method for laundering money, however.  Katherine Mangu-Ward noted for online magazine Slate: “About $8 billion worth of transactions were conducted in bitcoin from October 2012 to October 2013. During 2012, Bank of America processes $244.4 trillion in wire transfers and PayPal processed $145 billion.”  She summed up:  “The bitcoin haystack just isn’t big enough or messy enough to be a useful place to launder money right now. A better option: cash-heavy businesses, such as casinos or – yes – laundromats.”  “High level international cybercriminals have not by-and-large gravitated to peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin,”said Secret Service Special Agent Edward Lowery. Adding:  “Instead, they prefer ‘centralized digital currency’ that is based somewhere with looser regulations and lazier enforcement.”  A spokesman for the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office told Bloomberg in a recent email correspondence, “As prosecutors, we relish the opportunity to help define the law regarding this potentially important field.”  Considering that money laundering laws are mostly useless, unevenly applied and very costly to comply with, many hope that Florida will not define the laws as applying to bitcoin.

42397370,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4ATA,1393770024,Coin Miners Dogged By Mining Pool Security Flaws,"Distributed denial-of-service attacks have posed an increasingly severe problem for cryptocurrency exchanges and mining pools in recent weeks.      Last month, several major pools in the mining community suffered debilitating DDoS attacks that resulted in significant delays, lost mining time and frustration for miners.    In extreme cases, as explained by TeamDoge administrator Forrest Fuqua, some pools received ransom messages from hackers demanding payoffs in exchange for pulling back their attacks.  Fuqua said that security flaws in the Mining Portal Open Source (MPOS) pool software commonly used throughout the community have made it all too easy for cyber attackers to disrupt mining activities and extract ransoms from pools.  He cited the example of Dogepool.pw, which suffered a serious attack on its database. He added:  “Dogepool.pw actually got their database hacked at one point, due to the fact of insecurities in the main pool software that everyobody owns. Even the biggest mining pool for Litecoin uses it as their backend. It’s everywhere in their templates - they’re using the exact same framework. So some of these security exploits affect us all.”  More troubling is the fact that the security flaws are not fully understood by the mining community. When asked if these flaws meant that any pool using MPOS could suffer an attack, Fuqua said that these events are already taking place.  “They have been happening to other pools and we don’t know how.”  He suggested that it could be an internal backdoor built into the widely-available MPOS software, but Fuqua could not say affirmatively if this was the case.  Stolen coins  In the case of Dogepool.pw, at least 15 million dogecoins were taken from the pool’s master wallet, although Fuqua suggested that as much as 35 million dogecoins had been stolen.  In the case of TeamDoge, the hackers have struck numerous times, including an assault on the pool’s stratum software that is used to pull together the collective computing power of all the miners.  The miners sync with the protocol to receive notifications on their work, including the accrual of shares.  TeamDoge’s stratum protocol was hit by a DDoS attack comprised of more than 200,000 IP addresses. Given stratum’s limited capability for handling queries from users, it resulted in an outage of two and a half hours. Once stratum reaches its limit, the protocol begins dropping connections.  One of the issues is that structural problems in the MPOS software make it difficult for pool admins to make necessary changes. “Nobody touches [stratum], and there’s two reasons why,” Fuqua explained.  “Stratum is very sensitive to changes because of the way its written. Also, because it's the money maker. If your front end goes down, nobody cares. But if the stratum goes down, people stop making money, so there go your workers. And they scurry off to a different pool. No current DDoS protections can protect the stratum.”  “We were actually contacted by a guy ransoming the pool,” he continued. “He verifies this by turning off the DDoS and turning it back on.”  The cost of a DDoS attack    A DDoS attack on a pool can create major headaches for pool administrators like Fuqua.      The immediate impact is that the pool malfunctions and miners - who may not be actively monitoring their software - stop receiving shares for their work.      Depending on the severity of the attack, including whether or not the hackers actually infiltrate the database, the damage done to the system can result in even longer disruptions. Attacks can be damaging for reputations as well. Miners may fear that a pool is no longer safe and will look for alternative.      While most mining software allows configuration for backup pools, concerns over future attacks, and the corresponding loss of revenue, may be enough to dissuade a pool miner from returning.    Who is behind the attacks?  During the interview, Fuqua couldn’t say for sure who might be behind the attack. The most probable answer would be hackers hoping to accrue large amounts of coins to then move to exchanges. Fuqua went on to speculate that bad actors from competing pools may also be behind the attacks.  At the time of this writing, mining pools throughout the community continue to experience DDoS attacks on both their front-end servers as well as their stratum protocols.  Fuqua said he was currently engaged in upgrading TeamDoge’s infrastructure to help withstand - but not prevent - cyber attacks.  For the immediate future the risk of DDoS attacks on mining pools remains real. It remains to be seen whether or not developers will tackle the flaws in the commonly-used MPOS software.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/02/coin-miners-dogged-by-mining-pool-security-flaws,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/369648fe3fb0887dcb723dc3f5f9a8446fc9968f-1020x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374548,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlHFT,1393758123,What are the Consumer Benefits of Spending Bitcoin?,"Nick Tomaino is currently on the business development team at Coinbase, and is also a first-year business school student at the Yale School of Management. Prior to that, he worked in venture capital, most recently for Softbank Capital.  It is becoming increasingly clear to the public that Bitcoin is compelling for merchants as a more efficient payment processing option.  But one question that is far from clear and will likely take longer to become apparent is: what are the consumer benefits to using the digital currency, outside of investment and speculation?  Most mainstream consumers view bitcoin as a volatile asset that has no true benefit for consumers looking to spend on goods and services. In Senator Joe Manchin’s letter to the Treasury Department, he wrote:  “Its deflationary trends ensure that only speculators such as so-called ‘Bitcoin miners’ will benefit from possessing the virtual currency.”  This is a dangerous misconception that is often voiced by newcomers to bitcoin. While bitcoin is currently volatile and there are clear risks associated with it, there are also major benefits to spending bitcoin that are likely to become apparent as consumers learn more about the digital currency: cost savings, privacy, and ease of use.  Cost savings  Cost savings may ultimately be the most compelling benefit for bitcoin consumers.  The cost savings on the merchant side are clear when you consider the interchange fees, assessment fees, chargeback fees and false declines that merchants currently incur by using existing payment methods.  Ultimately, these fees are passed on to consumers, evidenced by the $0.75 fee you may pay for a transaction under $10.  We’re already seeing large merchants pass the cost savings bitcoin brings on to consumers. Tiger Direct is currently offering $20 off all orders over $100. Fancy.com is currently offering a 25% off coupon on all bitcoin purchases until Sunday.  These promotions are short term, but we expect many large merchants to offer long term discounts on bitcoin purchases in the near future.  As these cost savings continue, consumers will soon realize that unlike credit cards companies, who cause merchants to price their goods higher and pass savings back to only a subset of the consumer base (credit card holders in the form of reward points), bitcoin enables lower prices for the masses.  Privacy  Privacy is on the minds of many US consumers right now, following the significant security breaches that occurred over the past few months at large retailers such as Target and Neiman Marcus.  These security breaches highlight a fundamental difference between bitcoin and traditional online payment methods.  Generally, when you pay for something online with a debit or credit card, you are giving that merchant personally identifiable information about yourself that is susceptible to theft.  While tokenization techniques are becoming more commonly used by credit card companies, these techniques are still susceptible to error. The full details of the Target breach haven’t emerged yet but many believe that the perpetrator found a way to circumvent Target’s tokenization.  When a consumer uses bitcoin to pay for goods or services online, they only share the public key and the amount of the payment with the merchant. There is no personally identifiable information shared that makes the consumer susceptible to identity theft.  In order for a consumer’s funds to be used, the public key and private key must be obtained by the thief. For consumers that value privacy and want to prevent identify theft, bitcoin provides an alternative to existing payment options.  Ease of use  Anyone that has used a Coinbase wallet to make a purchase on Overstock, Fancy or any of our 25,000 merchants has likely recognized that our two-click check out process is a truly seamless buying experience.  Paying in bitcoin eliminates the need to enter personal information and jump through additional verification hoops, steps which most existing payment methods require.  Coinbase and other bitcoin companies provide what is arguably the most frictionless checkout experience on the internet.  These three key benefits are likely to appeal to different consumers, and it is unclear which one will become the primary driver of long-term consumer adoption.  When the consumer Internet became widespread, we couldn’t have imagined amazing services like Airbnb or Uber being built on top of it – we’re at a similar place with the Bitcoin network.  Since Bitcoin is still in the early stages of its development, the benefits to consumers are myriad, and those listed above will be realized very soon. But as the technology matures and becomes ever more mainstream, the possibilities are endless.
