42375038,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw59t7,1648422564,First Mover Asia: Crypto Concerns Weigh on Taiwan PC Component Makers' Stocks; Bitcoin Springs to 3-Month High,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin soars to three-month high; other major cryptos also gain.  Insights: With Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake and a decline in pricing for graphics cards, the share prices of major manufacturers of PC components have fallen.  Technician's take: Seasonal strength could keep buyers active within BTC's year-long price range.

And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization shot past $46,800 at one point, rising over 4% over one two-hour period to reach a three-month high. Bitcoin has gained over 12% since last Sunday after climbing six consecutive days, although it remains off its $47,200 starting point in 2022.  Ether and most other major cryptos were also blooming. The second-largest crypto by market cap followed a similar pattern to bitcoin on Sunday and was changing hands at over $3,270, its highest level since early February. Solana, Cardano and Avalanche, among other altcoins were well into the green. Popular meme coins for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, were up about 6% and 3.4%, respectively.  Trading was accelerating after weeks of low volumes.  ""Trading volumes are up as buyers try to turn this resistance line into support and take further steps up in pricing,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote to CoinDesk, but added: ""If we don't remain above this line, we will consolidate lower than here.""  DiPasquale said that bitcoin had had ""a strong week, especially given the quarterly options expiry"" on Friday and noted that bitcoin had ""shown resilience"" following the Federal Reserve's decision last week to raise interest rates and the continued escalation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine with its economic fallout.  But he was also cautious in his appraisal of the coming days. ""While market participants are starting to get bullish and the fear and greed index is at neutral, BTC bulls will want to see the price consolidating above $46,000 for further continuation,"" he said. ""The coming week is also important as it marks the end of the quarter and we could see increased volatility after that.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,543 +0.5%  DJIA: 34,861 +0.4%  Nasdaq: 14,169 -0.1%  Gold: $1,958 -.06%  Insights  Taiwan’s PC component makers remain profitable, but crypto concerns are weighing on their stocks  With Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake and away from proof-of-work, miners no longer need all the graphics cards they hoarded over the last few years.  Shares of Asus, Gigabyte and MSI, Taiwan-based component makers that produce graphics cards are down year to date as the market prices in slackening demand for their graphics cards.  Preliminary data shows a massive drop in pricing for graphics cards as Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake nears, with some prices dropping by over 50%. At electronics markets in China, used GPUs are showing up by the crate load and new ones aren’t moving like they used to leading to an excess of inventory.  As a refresher, proof-of-stake puts the onus on securing the blockchain to those that have a large treasury. By staking their coins – committing them to a bond-like savings structure – these coins become validators for network transitions. Proof-of-work, in contrast, relies on miners working on increasingly difficult mathematical problems to mine the coins and thus secure the network.  GPUs and mining  Graphics Processing Units (GPU), the brain inside a graphics card, were ideal for this as the processor inside them was designed to compute mathematical equations at a massively parallel scale.  Nvidia (NVDA) first learned the graphics cards built for gaming can be used for general-purpose computing in the mid-2000s, perfecting the method in the early 2010s with something called general-purpose computing on graphics processing units, or GPGPU compute.  The ability to do mathematical computations with massive parallelism was great for making photorealistic graphics in games, but more valuable to bring on the big data revolution. Nvidia and its competitor AMD (AMD) make specialized GPUs that are used in server farms, and also advanced workstations for research.  Researchers were able to quickly sequence the COVID-19 virus because of the computing power available to them thanks to the advent of GPGPU compute, which didn’t exist during the SARS pandemic.  Miners gobbled up cards  While Nvidia and AMD design the GPUs, they rely on partners to integrate them into boards that fit into computers, called add-in boards.  The majority of these partners are based in Taiwan, and are brands recognizable to computer enthusiasts such as Asus, Gigabyte or MSI.  While Asus has a comprehensive lineup of PCs, notebooks, tablets and phones, Gigabyte and MSI rely more on selling individual components like graphics cards and motherboards.  And their stock prices this year reflect this.     Year to date, Gigabyte and MSI are both down 16%. At the same time, Asus is roughly flat. Data from market research house IDC shows PC shipments are still the best they’ve been in a decade, but they’ve slowed compared to the halcyon days of the height of the pandemic, when everyone needed new computers to accommodate families working and attending school at home.  But that’s not to say that Gigabyte and MSI are doing poorly.  Since 2020, Gigabyte is up over 150% while Asus is up 60% and MSI up 52%. This connects to key events: the coronavirus pandemic, which caused the PC supercycle, and the crypto bull run of 2020-2021 that drove up demand for GPUs to mine ether (ETH).  Now compare this to the dog days of 2014-2015 when crypto wasn’t really a thing, and incremental advances in graphics technology meant that gamers didn’t need to upgrade their PCs. Gigabyte posted sub-$100 million yearly profits, and MSI was as equally hard hit as the two were unable to move as many graphics cards and motherboards as they would have liked.  To be sure, there’s still lots going on at these component makers. MSI is still expecting revenue for 2022 to come in at a record high, though the slowing GPU sales will sting. All this isn’t a bad thing. Gamers, the intended audience for these GPUs, will be able to now buy them at a price close to MSRP — a feat that’s been impossible for years.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Faces Initial Resistance at $46K; Support at $42K  Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be overbought on intraday charts, which typically leads to a short-term pullback in price. The cryptocurrency faces initial resistance near $46,000, which is the top of a three-month long trading range. Still, support between $40,000-$42,000 could stabilize pullbacks.  On the weekly chart, BTC established a higher price low relative to the June 2021 bottom around $28,800. The latest cycle low was achieved this year on Jan. 24 at $33,100, indicating renewed buying strength. Further, momentum signals are on the verge of turning positive, which could support a short-term relief rally.  Stronger resistance is seen at $50,996, which is a 50% retracement of the prior downtrend. At that point, BTC's rally could stall, similar to what occurred in September 2021. This time, however, seasonal strength between April and May could keep buyers active, albeit within a year-long trading range.  On the monthly chart, momentum signals remain negative. That means upside is limited because of strong overhead resistance emanating from the April and November price peaks.

For most of us, this was the first time we&apos;d ever heard of such an idea. It had most people scratch their heads in confusion (and disbelief). But after six months of following up on news coverage and checking back in with local businesses and governments, it seems Bitcoin has brought more positive changes to El Salvador than we thought. It brought changes that could make other countries rethink their financial systems down the road. The adoption was due to several factors. This includes an inflation rate that had gone through the roof, poverty levels steadily increasing, and lack of faith in their own government&apos;s ability to solve their country&apos;s problems. Many economists predicted this move would be disastrous. Instead, they are in shock by how well this transition has gone so far, and how the economy has responded positively to this new economic policy.

Users prefer to use Solana, Avalanche, Fantom as gas fees on all of these chains cost less than a dollar. Ethereum has less throughput also in comparison to other Layer 1 blockchains. On Ethereum, only 10-12 transactions get executed per second, while on other Layer 1 blockchains have the capacity of thousands of transactions per second. High Gas fees and less throughput are the two critical reasons for the slow growth of Ethereum ecosystem usage in 2021, while at the same time Layer 1 blockchains saw a major rise both in terms of users and price.

Reasons for its Growth Both Cardano and Polkadot have their reasons for their recent growth. Cardano has been experiencing this high valuation due to the changing market sentiments towards blockchain.

42407273,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVUMwu,1648396800,Crypto Carbon: Can Blockchain Networks Fix Carbon Offsets?,"Cryptocurrency has become a boogeyman in conservation circles, but a growing corner of the industry is claiming to have a solution to the climate crisis: crypto carbon credits.  In the coming years, companies from Procter & Gamble (PG) to Nestlé (NSRGY) are vowing to go “carbon neutral,” a feel-good moniker signaling they will prevent as much carbon from entering the atmosphere elsewhere as they emit.  This article is part of Mining Week.  One of the ways these companies aim to achieve their emission goals is by purchasing carbon credits – certificates representing carbon dioxide that’s been kept out of the atmosphere by some act of conservation or removal.  While some point to carbon credits as a pragmatic solution to the planet’s climate woes, others say they make the problem worse – giving polluters free rein to emit more than they would otherwise.  Still, with leaf-green logos and websites emblazoned with pictures of the lush Amazon rainforest, a new cohort of crypto projects is embracing carbon credits.  Projects like Toucan, Regen and Moss say on-chain carbon credits will increase transparency and improve accessibility to the carbon credit market.  Another project, KlimaDAO, aims to bump up the price of carbon credits by tapping into a corner of crypto where memes are gospel, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is king and everyone is on the hunt for sky-high returns. Klima’s pseudonymous founders present Discord-dwelling degens with a question: What if you can save the environment by holding crypto?  From carbon industry veterans and environmental scientists to retail investors and accountants, a diverse group of voices has found its way into crypto’s regenerative finance, or ReFi, movement, with seemingly everyone evincing a different view as to how – and to what degree – crypto can be leveraged to solve the defining crisis of our time.  If the past few months are any indication, making progress might mean stepping on some toes.  From the cryptosphere to the atmosphere  Today, it’s hard to find a headline relating to crypto and the environment that doesn’t contain some reference to the extraordinary energy costs of the two largest blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Both chains use energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanisms to keep themselves secure, wherein a horde of computers around the globe compete to process transactions in a practice called “mining.”  Read more: Mining Industry Not That Worried by SEC’s Proposed New Climate Reporting Rules  The mining comparison is apt. According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), bitcoin mining consumes 135 terawatt-hours of electricity per year – more than is consumed in a year by the entire country of Norway. By CBECI’s estimate, bitcoin – crypto’s so-called “digital gold” – consumes more energy than the real-world gold mining industry.  While crypto’s energy use is immense, many within the industry caution that simplistic comparisons like these are misleading – particularly when one takes into account the amount of mining energy that comes from renewable sources (though this, too, is debated).  Moreover, not all blockchains require the same amount of energy. Outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum, most major blockchains employ a more sustainable proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Ethereum is in the process of transitioning to its own PoS algorithm, which, according to the Ethereum Foundation, will cut the network’s energy use by ~99.95%.  Whatever crypto’s net carbon footprint, it will likely be a while before the general public comes to revise its view of blockchain technology as an ecological menace.  In the meantime, the ReFi movement is already presenting a new, eco-friendly face for crypto.  What are carbon credits?  ReFi’s proposals for addressing the climate crisis are wide-ranging, but most attention thus far has been directed towards reforms to the global carbon credit market.  Carbon credits – also called carbon offsets – represent projects that reduce emissions or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, such as preserving forests, building wind and solar farms, or capturing methane gas.  In general, one carbon credit represents one metric ton of carbon dioxide that has been saved from the atmosphere. To a purchaser it represents permission to emit that same amount of carbon guilt-free (and in some cases, tax-free).  A global carbon market emerged in 1997 with the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty that established carbon credits as a way for countries to offset their emissions to reach limits set by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  Since then, several international bodies have emerged to regulate the registration and sale of carbon credits. In more recent years a “voluntary” carbon market has sprung up to enable eco-conscious companies – including some crypto mining groups – to offset their emissions beyond what is required by any government.  The challenge with carbon accounting  Advocates of market-based solutions to the climate crisis say turning carbon into a commodity aligns the interests of the planet with the interests of corporate bank accounts.  Luis Felipe Adaime, the founder of the Brazil-based ReFi company Moss, is one such advocate. Moss buys up carbon credits from forest preservation projects in places like Costa Rica and the areas bordering the Amazon rainforest. It then incorporates those credits into a popular token, MCO2, which is listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase (COIN) and is marketed as a way for crypto investors to help preserve the planet.  “Carbon credits have become a way to make forested land expensive,” Adaime told CoinDesk. “People who were considering, you know, burning the [forest] down to plant soy start thinking ‘Oh, wow, I can actually make more money protecting the forest than by burning it down to raise cattle.’”  Critics of carbon accounting point to research suggesting that some carbon credits are not as green as they purport to be, with widely documented incidents of fraud, double-counting and creative accounting rendering a large portion of carbon credits untrustworthy.  It’s extremely difficult to quantify exactly how much CO2 a given project keeps out of the atmosphere, and poor quality credits have the potential to actively harm the environment by enabling companies to superficially offset their emissions whilst emitting more than they would have in the first place.  Moss operates in the voluntary carbon market. Although the company only buys credits that are verified by established carbon credit registries like Verra and Gold Standard, any enterprising entrepreneur can theoretically set up a conservation project and sell credits.  Some companies are happy to gobble up cheap credits from questionable conservation projects in exchange for a quick public relations boost, meaning voluntary credit retailers arguably have less of an incentive than their compliance-oriented peers to engage in high-quality measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) practices.  Despite its smoke-and-mirrors reputation, the voluntary carbon market saw $1 billion in turnover last year – a paltry sum in comparison to the $850 billion compliance market but a record number fueled, in part, by a growing number of companies that are bringing voluntary credits onto blockchains.  A more transparent carbon market  At a high level, the pitch for on-chain carbon is simple: By moving the voluntary carbon market onto a blockchain and publicly tying each credit to metadata attesting to its quality and origin, those wishing to offset their emissions will have access to a transparently priced, highly liquid offset market unlike any that exists today.  Even better, watchdogs will be able to track claims of carbon neutrality directly back to the source.  “Markets are efficient if they’re open, transparent and fair,” Raphaël Haupt, CEO of the carbon-to-crypto startup Toucan, told CoinDesk. “Currently, this is just not the case with the [legacy] carbon market.”  Read more: Bitcoin Mining and ESG: A Match Made in Heaven  When it launched in October, Toucan made waves for a fruitful, albeit controversial partnership with KlimaDAO – a new blockchain protocol built and governed by a pseudonymous community of KLIMA token-holders. With Klima’s help, Toucan “bridged” an impressive 20 million tons of carbon onto the Ethereum sidechain Polygon, tokenizing 5% of all credits on Verra, the largest voluntary credit registry.  Bridging a credit onto Toucan’s blockchain protocol means first “retiring” that credit on its parent registry so it can’t be double-counted as an offset. Once a batch of credits has been retired, Toucan issues a non-fungible token (NFT) representing them virtually.  The NFT holds data relating to the specific offset project it represents. It can be sold on the open market, or it can be fractionalized into Tokenized CO2 (TCO2) tokens. These carbon-based tokens can trade like any other cryptocurrency on a decentralized exchange (DEX).  Just as in the traditional carbon credit system, Toucan envisions on-chain retirements as a way for companies and individuals to offset their carbon footprint. Retiring an on-chain credit involves “burning” it by locking it away in a blockchain address that no one has access to.  Carbon markets meet DeFi  The main advantage of projects like Toucan is in opening up the carbon market to the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  In an ideal world, buying and selling carbon credits should be as easy as trading stocks, but one challenge with the legacy carbon market is that credits from different projects are not directly interchangeable.  “We don’t believe that each ton of carbon is the same,” Haupt explained to CoinDesk, “because there are clear differences in how these credits have been created. … There’s a difference whether or not it’s a reduction-based project – because you have a wind farm somewhere – versus a direct air capture project in Switzerland … they just do very different things.”  In other words, some types of projects are thought to be more effective than others at keeping carbon out of the atmosphere. These differences tend to be reflected in a credit’s price.  This fragmentation of the carbon credit market has led to a legacy system whereby most companies and governments are forced to purchase credits through complicated broker agreements or direct partnerships with project developers rather than through an open marketplace.  Read more: ExxonMobil Running Pilot Project to Supply Flared Gas for Bitcoin Mining: Report  Even with a blockchain-based open marketplace, Toucan’s TCO2 tokens remain difficult to trade since each token represents a specific project. Without a ton of other TCO2 tokens floating around on the market, it can be difficult for people to buy and sell specific credits.  In market-speak, TCO2 – and carbon credits in general – suffer from a lack of liquidity.  Toucan aims to add liquidity to the illiquid carbon market using a variation on a staple tool of DeFi called a “liquidity pool.”  Toucan users can add their TCO2 tokens to pools containing a mix of TCO2 tokens representing similar projects. In exchange for locking their credits in one of Toucan’s pools, users receive a new token, this one representing a slice of the whole pool rather than one specific offsetting project.  This fungible, index-like token, because it is far more numerous than any project-specific TCO2 token, is much easier to trade.  The first pool introduced by Toucan was the Base Carbon Tonne (BCT), which accepts a wide variety of credit types issued by the Verra registry. The pool’s BCT token is highly liquid and trades around the average price of BCT-qualifying carbon credits sold off-chain.  The carbon black hole  Toucan managed to create infrastructure for a liquid carbon market, but that infrastructure was worthless until Toucan could convince people to hand over carbon credits – a tricky proposition when most organizations, including Verra, are reluctant to recognize the legitimacy of Toucan-bridged credits, given that they are technically “retired” by the time they make it on-chain.  Enter, KlimaDAO, whose meme-fueled, Mark Cuban-funded, “carbon black hole” rallied 40,000 “Klimates” to inject Toucan’s on-chain carbon ecosystem with much-needed CO2.  In addition to providing liquidity to the crypto carbon market, Klima was founded on a fundamental principle in carbon accounting: the higher the price of carbon, the better for the environment.  The logic for more expensive carbon is simple; if carbon is more expensive, companies and governments should pollute less since it will cost them more to offset their emissions. Moreover, more expensive carbon credits mean more incentive for people to start emission-reduction and removal projects.  A recent Reuters poll of about 30 climate economists suggested that to reach the Paris Agreement’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, we must quickly reach an average minimum price of $100 per metric ton of CO2.  According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the average global price of carbon is currently a meager $3.  KlimaDAO’s approach for increasing the price of carbon used game theory mechanics trailblazed by the controversial Olympus DAO (OHM) project. At a high level, Klima incentivizes people to sweep as much carbon off the market as possible by locking it up in their treasuries. With fewer carbon credits circulating, the thinking goes, the overall price of CO2 should increase.  One of KlimaDAO’s core contributors, the pseudonymous “Dionysus,” explained Klima’s strategy as a “liquidity engine” for the on-chain carbon market.  “Essentially, we incentivize people through bonds to deposit carbon offsets from various different types of projects into our treasury,” Dionysus told CoinDesk. “And then, in return, we're issuing this carbon-backed currency (KLIMA).”  “Holding the KLIMA token is essentially like holding an index of the carbon market in a way that will increasingly be the case as new carbon offsets are bridged on-chain,” said Dionysus.  For a little while, Klima’s strategy for pumping the price of carbon was working. In October, when KlimaDAO launched alongside Toucan, the returns for handing over BCT to Klima were sky high, and the protocol managed to suck up a huge amount of real-world carbon into its virtual coffers.  In its first week, the price of KLIMA shot up from a bit below $2,000 to above $3,000. Meanwhile, KlimaDAO was printing out new KLIMA tokens by the ton for its stakers – people who locked up their tokens in smart contracts where they can’t be sold (since selling could risk tanking KLIMA’s price). At one point, keeping your KLIMA staked would have increased your balance by 300-fold over the course of a year.  Read more: Revisiting Bitcoin’s Energy ‘Problem’ in the Face of ESG Investment Mandates  The crazy returns incentivized more and more people to hand over their CO2 credits in exchange for KLIMA. Billionaire Mark Cuban even got in on the action, telling his over 8 million Twitter followers he’d been “buying 50K in offsets every 10 days or so, verifying them and putting them on-chain as BCT.”  At its peak, the price of BCT reached $8, higher than the $3 average for similar off-chain credits and proof that Klima was, at least for the moment, fulfilling its goal of pulling enough carbon into its orbit to increase the price of offsets.  Back to Earth  Many observers of Olympus DAO, which spearheaded the bonding/staking model adopted by Klima, were quick to call it a Ponzi scheme – a criticism not unfamiliar to crypto as a whole, but one particularly hard to rebut given the rate at which new tokens were being printed out to Olympus (and Klima) stakers.  The thinking went that if enough people decided to sell their KLIMA tokens, feedback loops would quickly send the price spiraling downwards, leading to a game of chicken in which everyone would eventually be forced to sell their tokens or risk holding the bag once things drop to zero.  The anti-Olympus fearmongering was eventually realized. Within a couple of months of Klima and other Olympus-inspired projects shooting up in value and igniting a frenzy within DeFi circles, the Ponzinomic rocket ship crashed back to Earth.  The price of KLIMA, once above $3,200, now sits at $20.  Yet, it’s hard to call Klima a failure. While the Klima treasury is no longer growing at the rate it was before the crash, it has still absorbed an enormous amount of carbon credits – representing 20 million tons. according to its official dashboards. (Verra has confirmed these numbers to CoinDesk.)  The price of Toucan’s Base Carbon Tonne has fallen to $3 – which is more in line with the rest of the market – but Klima’s treasury holds over 90% of all BCT issued by Toucan, meaning Klima is largely to thank for kick-starting Toucan’s growth.  Even if Klima didn’t cause a major spike in the price of carbon, it at least played a major role in bootstrapping the fledgling crypto carbon ecosystem by introducing it to tens of thousands of investors and injecting it with much-needed liquidity.  At a minimum, the Klima experiment has proven that crypto’s culture and tools, if wielded creatively, can potentially make a dent in the carbon trade.  Klima’s critics  Not everyone agrees that Klima’s success in bootstrapping the crypto carbon ecosystem was worth the cost – alleging that questions around transparency, carbon quality and the legitimacy of on-chain retirements have undermined the degree to which it has had an impact.  Sarah Leugers is the chief strategy officer at Gold Standard, one of the major off-chain carbon credit registries.  Leugers allows that Klima likely had a positive impact on the overall price of carbon credits, telling CoinDesk, “I don't know if it was so much the fact that they reduced supply as the PR … but I think it’s a good impact.”  But Leugers echoed a concern raised by others interviewed for this article: “Why are the founders not interested in sharing what their identities are?”  According to Leugers, Klima’s embrace of anonymity – commonplace in the “meritocratic” world of decentralized autonomous organizations – seems to contradict its supposed goal of bringing transparency to the carbon credit market.  Dionysus defended the project’s use of pseudonyms to CoinDesk as, among other things, an effective marketing ploy.  “For some of the off-chain players – the traditional people in the market – there is sort of this mystery and allure to what KlimaDAO is doing because they're seeing people like Archimedes, Dionysus, etcetera,” he said. “I tend to believe that like, any type of like, attention … is just overall beneficial, right? Even if it raises eyebrows, it's still attention from the types of industry players that we want looking at what we're doing.”  He clarified further:  To be very clear, with strategic partners and things of that nature, we’re doxxed. We’re not talking to corporates as Dionysus or something.  Whatever its rationale, Klima’s commitment to anonymity set off additional alarm bells with the massive rise and fall of the KLIMA token price.  “I find the precipitous drop in KlimaDAO to be interesting,” Leugers said. “... I’d like to know who made money there, and who lost.”  “It might just be, you know, an innovation that needs to be calibrated,” she added. “... I hope that's the case.”  Read more: Former Oilfield Drillers See Energy Sector and Bitcoin Mining Joining Forces  In general, Leugers would have liked to have seen closer partnerships between Klima and industry players from the get-go.  “They call me and Gold Standard ‘dinos’ … they say we don't know what we're talking about,” Leugers said. She was referencing a recent Twitter thread started by Moss’s Luis Felipe Adaime that was critical of an article Leugers authored about the blockchain carbon market.  Dionysus chimed in on the thread, saying, “I think it's important for players like [Gold Standard] to be a bit more critical of the highly opaque, [over-the-counter] trade-dominated market that they're currently a part of rather than attempt to undermine new players who are bringing a wave of innovation to the space.”  According to Leugers, Klima was “a bit arrogant and just plowed ahead and said, ‘We know how to fix this problem,’ not being cognizant that there are a lot of people who have been at this problem for a long time.”  As a result, said Leugers, “I think they were blindsided by some issues that they just didn't know about.”  Quality carbon  Perhaps more troubling than Klima’s price charts or its embracing of anonymity are concerns around the underlying quality of the credits it brought on-chain.  In December, Toucan and Klima were reported to have bridged 600,000 tonnes of credits from Chinese gas projects that, in 2014, were widely determined to have used fraudulent methods.  “[Toucan and Klima] didn't know that there were still credits sitting on Verra’s registry that were totally bunk,” said Leugers, “...[E]veryone knew it and no trader would sell them because everybody knew it.”  A statement from Toucan said that it has “blocklisted” the projects to prevent them from being tokenized in the future, but the event called into focus the lax criteria for credits allowed into Toucan’s BCT pool.  Gregory Landua, the founder of Regen – a carbon credit bridge like Toucan – was a supporter of Toucan and Klima’s effort to jump-start the crypto carbon ecosystem, but he said launching Klima with BCT was a mistake.  Aside from the credits that were known to have been fraudulent, “the dominant assets that make up BCT are, like, these crappy Chinese natural gas grid replacement projects where they're replacing coal with natural gas or hydro,” he told CoinDesk. “There wasn’t really a market for them. Nobody was buying them.”  Toucan’s Raphaël Haupt echoed Landua’s sentiment, noting that he launched BCT as Toucan’s first pool at the urging of his launch partners at Klima.  “I would have loved to launch Klima with a higher quality credit in the back,” said Haupt. “If you're trying to back currency… you also want to have collateral that’s, like, great collateral.”  Dionysus – who says his professional background is in the carbon market – recognized the quality issues with BCT, but defended Klima’s choice to start with lower-quality credits. “BCTs criteria for acceptance was very, very wide,” he explained, “because we were worried that we would not be able to have enough liquidity to move on-chain… we wanted to ensure that there were a lot of options for people.”  Klima now allows users to add other assets into its treasury – including Natural Carbon Tonnes (NCT), a new pool from Toucan restricted to higher quality Verra credits (although BCT still accounts for 90% of Klima’s treasury).  In a controversial move at odds with Klima’s stated goal of sucking offsets into a carbon “black hole,” the project’s community recently approved a governance proposal to allow for “inverse bonding.” This would theoretically enable the KlimaDAO treasury to sell carbon credits back to the market if the KLIMA token price falls below a certain threshold.  Haupt characterized the proposal as a mistake, saying that “the ‘black hole’ now becomes, like, potentially the biggest emitter of carbon,” since it would enable KLIMA to push low-quality BCT assets back out into the marketplace.  This would have the effect of decreasing the price of BCT credits – the opposite of Klima’s original goal of increasing their price.  Even if the capability is there, Dionysus says that Klima’s decentralized community currently has no plans to sell BCT or any other carbon credits in its treasury.  Finding trust in trustlessness  While Klima and Toucan managed to create a new, liquid market for carbon credits (no small feat), they have yet to address a fundamental challenge to the global carbon market: the actual quality of underlying credits.  Mars Garza, an investor at XYZ Venture Capital who focuses on the intersection of climate and Web 3, told CoinDesk that she’s looking forward to a shift towards projects “working with carbon projects versus carbon credits.”  While adding credits to the blockchain can lead to certain efficiency and transparency improvements, the success of on-chain carbon will require improvements to the existing, off-chain systems that generate and verify offset projects.  Haupt admits as much himself. “The carbon value chain is [screwed], that’s just a reality,” he said. “We have to accelerate the development cycles of carbon projects. … Toucan is just one piece of the infrastructure that is needed to deliver that at scale.”  Read more: How Northern Italian Hydropower Producers Became Bitcoin Miners  Some ReFi founders point to the idea of a “meta-registry” – a long-term vision espoused by Toucan, Regen, and other players in the carbon-bridge space – whereby anyone can add a carbon credit to the blockchain. Rather than a few establishment gatekeepers like Verra and Gold Standard verifying most voluntary credits, this meta-registry approach would theoretically lead to the proliferation of a new class of offsetting projects for whom existing verification methods are too restrictive.  To ensure credit quality, Landua says that Regen’s meta-registry would label credits with “tags that can only be issued by trusted, on-chain entities that are essentially auditing entities.”  While Leugers praised the idea of a meta-registry as “ambitious” and a “great future vision,” she also warned that “it's not going to be easy.”  “It’s really more difficult than people assume to ensure quality,” Gold Standard’s Leugers explained. “It’s not just about reading a meter. It’s like, how was that project set up? Were stakeholders engaged or not? Were safeguards properly followed? I mean, bad things can go really wrong in these projects.”  While a meta-registry would take advantage of the collaborative benefits of Web 3 – the future decentralized internet some believe crypto will foster – it still faces a dilemma that is particularly hard to solve with blockchain technology: Carbon credits will always require trust in someone.  Whether it’s Toucan relying on Verra to back its Base Carbon Tonne, or Regen relying on a new class of crypto-native verifiers, it is difficult to see how a meta-registry can fundamentally reform the carbon credit system without relying on the same kinds of imperfect verification schemes that exist off-chain.  On-chain carbon is not, as some skeptics might claim, a grift meant to exploit environmental fears in exchange for personal profit. Projects like Toucan and Klima have proven that blockchain technology can have a positive impact on the carbon market, and they’ve persuaded industry players to take the tech seriously.  But a blockchain carbon market is not a silver bullet for solving the climate crisis.  The limits of ReFi come down to the limits of crypto as a whole. Just as DeFi is trying to overhaul a corrupt financial system, ReFi is trying to fix a flawed system of climate accounting.  Both movements herald the “trustless” nature of blockchains as a way to remove power from gatekeepers, thereby improving access and increasing transparency. And yet both movements, along with their undeniable successes, have found limits effectuating the whole of their visions without falling back on more traditional structures of trust and centralization.  Most of ReFi’s supporters recognize the limits of crypto for saving the climate, but they remain optimistic in their great experiment.  As Haupt puts it, “You know, if looking back 10 years from now, we realize … we’ve contributed to starting this movement, and it’s not taken off … whether or not we’re still part of that, I honestly don’t care … I think it’s the most impactful work that I could do as a human being right now.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/27/crypto-carbon-can-blockchain-networks-fix-carbon-offsets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d69cea881852578e8075de190ba6596a228c85be-2500x1874.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410894,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt3Qt,1648392600,"Just as Hal Finney Predicted, Bitcoin Is Being Purchased to Act as a Reserve Currency","Hal Finney received the first-ever Bitcoin transaction. Hal passed from ALS in 2014, but his legacy lives on because he was a genius (at least, by my account). Or a time traveler. Or a clairvoyant. I mean, he tweeted this in 2009.  Later, in 2010, Finney wrote a message on the famed BitcoinTalk forum that discussed the “ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the ‘high-powered money’ that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash.” Now we’re seeing another Finney premonition potentially coming true.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  On March 14, Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs, announced UST was going to be backed by a $10 billion reserve of bitcoin (BTC). Terraform Labs created the Terra protocol that issues the stablecoin terraUSD (UST) and luna (LUNA), the latter of which algorithmically backs the former.  While Terraform Labs is not exactly a bank, it is issuing its own digital cash to make paying for things easier – and it’s about to be backed by bitcoin. This is a big deal for anyone with a vested interest in the Bitcoin system, even if you vehemently reject altcoins (non-bitcoin cryptos; there is another, less flattering term for these).  Stablecoins? More like stabley-declining-in-real-terms-coins…  Taking a step back, a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to some other asset, usually the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins are important because they are widely used in crypto trading, with Tether’s USDT making up a majority of trading volume. But they also have potential payment applications. In total, USD stablecoins represent at least $180 billion of total market value.  Most popular stablecoins, like USDT and Circle’s USD coin (USDC), hold real-world assets as backing. For USDT, it’s a mixed bag; for USDC it’s cash (and “fairly stated” cash equivalents). These are called collateralized stablecoins. There are other types of stablecoins known as algorithmic stablecoins, like UST.  An algorithmic stablecoin isn’t collateralized; instead, coins are either burned or minted to keep the coin’s value in line with the target price. For UST, that’s where LUNA comes inhttps://www.terra.money/intro-to-terra. LUNA backs UST. When UST’s price is too high (>$1), the protocol incentivizes users to burn (destroy) LUNA and mint (make) UST. When UST’s price is too low (<$1), the protocol incentivizes users to burn (destroy) UST and mint (make) LUNA.The incentivization process is sort of complicated, but there’s a fancy market modulehttps://docs.terra.money/docs/develop/module-specifications/spec-market.html that makes sure this happens since people can make money if they make the appropriate arbitrage trades to nudge UST (and the other non-U.S. dollar stablecoins Terraform Labs issues) to the appropriate value. In short, it’s just “supply and demand.”  How exactly does $10 billion of bitcoin fit in?  I’ll admit that I sorta kinda lied to you. UST is algorithmic but it will become somewhat collateralized. The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) was set up in January. LFG is a nonprofit organization with a mission focused on promoting a “truly decentralized economy.” Its primary focus is Terra and providing a reserve backstop in case the UST/LUNA incentive mechanism fails. What better asset to hold in reserve than the preeminent crypto and reserve asset 3.0?  Initially, LFG intends to buy $3 billion of BTC. Of that, $2.2 billion has already been raised through $1 billion of outside funding and $1.2 billion of USDT which was purchased with UST that LFG already had (the remaining $800 million is coming). Kwon added on Twitter that the BTC reserve could grow to $10 billion by using a “portion of the seigniorage '' through normal operation of the Terra protocol to buy BTC. Seigniorage is a big word for the excess value of newly minted currency over the cost of producing it. In government terms, U.S. quarters have less than $0.25 of metal in them; in UST terms, the cost of production is nearly zero so a portion of seigniorage profits are burned and the other portion goes to the treasury.  When is LFG going to buy all that bitcoin, and why should we care?  It may have already started. There is a bitcoin address that’s rumored to be LFG’s and it looks as if the nonprofit is buying $125 million of BTC every day. For an asset that churns out >$20 billion in volume each day that doesn’t seem like much, but 60 basis points of volume can be meaningful. Kyle Davies of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital indicated as much on Twitter. These daily purchases could also last for months if LFG does in fact want to get to $10 billion of BTC reserves.  This should appeal to anyone who pays attention to crypto. The main criticism of collateralized stablecoins is that their need for “attestations” (not quite the same thing as audits) by accountants cut against the ethos of crypto. “Don’t trust, verify” pulses through the veins of lovers of decentralization, and just taking what Circle or Tether tells us about their backing at face value seems wrong.  If successful, UST could become a dollar stablecoin backed by a completely auditable, transparent and decentralized digital asset. That’s a big deal. You won’t need to trust Do Kwon that the collateral is there, nor an accounting firm that will qualify its assurances with weasel words. You’ll be able to see for yourself on the blockchain.  And if this happens, you won’t be able to convince me that Hal wasn’t just another physical manifestation of Pythia.",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNA | USDT,BTC | FIAT | LUNA | TRADING | USDT,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/27/just-as-hal-finney-predicted-bitcoin-is-being-purchased-to-act-as-a-reserve-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cb3a9cd015383b4d53d0dfcb3525d0b6430dcb2-5284x3522.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It is a wallet with a specially designed motherboard, that stores your key on a physical device. Hardware wallets provide you with extra layers of protection that prevent your private keys from cyber attacks, phishing, and malware. Why do people prefer these over software wallets? Here are some of the advantages of hardware wallets over software wallets: 1. Security: Hardware wallets are the safest way to keep your private keys because they are not exposed to viruses. An encryption pin protects the hardware wallet. This pin is created and known only to you. If someone tries to start the device by manipulating different pins forcefully, the device will stop automatically after the third wrong pin entry. 2. Self Reliance: Possessing a hardware wallet permits you to be more self-reliant when guarding your bitcoin. You have to confirm your transaction via your hardware wallet and not online. Hence, nobody can complete transactions without getting access to your device. 3. Physical Size: As we know that a hardware wallet is smaller than a computer; keeping your private keys on a hardware wallet makes it more comfortable to transfer your bitcoin when required. 4.

The headline event was the open edition sale for &apos;MAX PAIN&apos; that earned over $23 Million. Over 7,00 NFTs were minted at the price of 1 ETH i.e $3,108. Other than the open edition NFT sale, two other limited copies were sold by XCOPY.

At this pace, the coin may spring higher to $155 in a buy trend continuation. Past Performance The DASH coin is stable on the last trading day but up an impressive 26 percent against the USDT in the previous trading week. Overall, DASH is within a bullish breakout pattern above the descending wedge and $105. As such, traders might find entries on dips, loading up in anticipation of more gains towards January 2022 highs of $155. DASH Technical Analysis From the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, buyers have the upper hand. Most notably, the coin is within a bullish breakout pattern. However, when writing, there are a series of lower lows relative to the upper BB pointing to decreasing upside momentum. Still, the token prices are within the March 20 and 23 trade range, a net positive from an effort versus results perspective. Based on this setup, traders may find buying opportunities between the $105 and $130 zone with targets at $155. A deep correction below the 20-day moving average and $105 cancels the uptrend. What to Expect DASH is bullish after dropping by 84 percent from May 2022 peaks. When writing, DASH is up 70 percent from 2022 lows, and buyers double down.
