33591130,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641934,1726354858,"Analysts Kick Against Cardano Recovery, Says ADA Price Is Destined For 33% Crash","The overall bearish sentiment for Cardano (ADA) continues to rise as analysts now foresee a massive 33% price crash for the altcoin. This pessimistic projection comes as ADA struggles to gain traction in the market, with its value remaining stagnant or steadily dropping to lower levels. Cardano (ADA) Crash Incoming Compared to other prominent altcoins in the crypto market, Cardano has performed poorly, struggling with price declines and sluggish growth. Consequently, a crypto analyst, identified as ‘Financialfreedomgoals’ on TradingView, predicted that cryptocurrency is likely to experience more than a 30% crash to new lows. Related Reading: BlackRock Calls Bitcoin ‘Hedge Against Global Disorder’, Analyst Sets $600,000 Target The analyst notes the broader negative state of the current crypto market, highlighting that most altcoins are stuck in a “bearish rut.” He disclosed that rather than achieving new all-time highs, these coins have been setting fresh lows, underscoring the persistent downtrend and decreased confidence amongst investors. Cardano, in particular, has had its share of negative sentiment and volatility. The cryptocurrency has stayed unwaveringly below the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 200 line, a key technical indicator traders often use to gauge long-term trends. Typically, when the price of a cryptocurrency stays below this line, it tends to signal a continuation of a bearish trend. Given the present bearish state of the market, the crypto analyst has dismissed the idea of an upcoming altcoin season, where the majority of cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin experience significant price gains. On the daily time frame, Cardano is trading below the EMA 200 line and the bearish trend line. Initially, a rising wedge pattern had formed on the cryptocurrency’s price chart, however instead of breaking out, Cardano saw a series of negative candlesticks alongside a bearish crossover on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). This series of negative indicators suggests that bears may be tightening their grip on Cardano’s price. As such, the crypto analyst foresees the ADA continuing its descent to reach fresh lows at target areas: 0.2506 or 0.2197. These targets are calculated using the Fibonacci retracement ratios of 1.272 and 1.618. 0.3815 Resistance Could Trigger Bullish Surge Despite maintaining a largely bearish stance on Cardano’s price outlook, Financialfreedomgoals has hinted at a potential bullish turnaround. He has suggested that a price reversal for ADA could be possible if the price of the cryptocurrency manages to break above the key resistance at 0.3815 Fibonacci level. Related Reading: Time To Convert Bitcoin To Ethereum? ETH/BTC Charts Gears Up For 180% Surge Crypto analyst Sssebi shares an even greater bullish outlook for Cardano. He highlights that during the previous bull market, ADA’s value increased by more than 100X. As a result, the analyst believes that ADA will rally by at least 20X in this current market cycle, expressing even stronger confidence that the cryptocurrency will reach $5 soon. As of writing, the price of ADA is trading at $0.3576, reflecting a significant increase of 11.39% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap.

33587897,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641937,1726347635,"Here Are The Major Developments That Could Drive Ethereum Price Back Above $4,000","Ethereum, the second largest crypto by market cap, is trading at $2,420 after a recent price rally. Ethereum has been up by 3.4% and 6.3% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively, which has raised hopes for an extended bullish run. As the price performance continues to unfold, some major developments are taking root, which could pave the way for Ethereum’s price to rally back above the $4,000 mark. Stablecoin Transaction Volume Hits New High Despite the bearish sentiment which has lingered in a 30-day timeframe, on-chain data shows that the Ethereum blockchain continues to witness massive activity, especially in the stablecoin niche. The stablecoin trading volume on the blockchain soared massively in August to break its previous all-time high. Particularly, the stablecoin trading volume reached $1.46 trillion. This surge in stablecoin activity further solidifies Ethereum’s position as the go-to blockchain platform in the world of DeFi. As stablecoin adoption continues to rise, this could drive up Ethereum revenue due to demand for ETH tokens used to pay transaction fees. This increased utility could, in turn, contribute to its price reaching $4,000 or beyond. Watch Out For The 0.015 Point In Funding Rates Another key factor to watch now for Ethereum is the funding rate. The funding rate is a metric that tracks the cost of holding a long or short position in the perpetual futures market. Funding rates reflect market sentiment, as positive funding rates indicate that longs are paying short positions, suggesting a bullish outlook, while negative rates show a bearish trend. According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, the Ethereum funding rate is approaching the 0.015 point. As an analyst at CryptoQuant pointed out, the Ethereum funding rate is currently hovering between 0.002 and 0.005. This movement is reminiscent of a pattern in September 2023, when the funding rate was similarly low. Although these figures might appear modest for a typical bull market, a CryptoQuant analyst has noted that this could be the calm before a major upward movement. This is because the funding rates eventually crossed 0.015 in 2023, allowing Ethereum to “surge from the $1,500s to $4,000s.” A similar occurrence could see Ethereum surging massively to $4,000 in the next few months. Ethereum: Network Growth According to Santiment, the Ethereum network has witnessed massive growth in the past week, recently reaching a four-month high. Apart from its L2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum, the platform remains the foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This network growth was accompanied by an increase in the creation of wallet addresses and active addresses. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,421. If these factors above align in favor of Ethereum, we could see ETH continue to approach the $4,000 mark.

33584696,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641876,1726340411,"112,000 ETH Moved To Crypto Exchanges In The Past Day — Impact On Ethereum Price?","The Ethereum price has been one of the major talking points in the crypto space lately, having been under significant bearish pressure in recent weeks. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency seems to be on a recovery path following its first positive weekly performance in more than a month. Recent on-chain data shows that significant amounts of ETH tokens have made their way to centralized exchanges in the past day. The question now is — could this hamper the recent progress shown by the Ethereum price? Here’s How Rising Exchange Inflow Affects Ethereum Price Prominent crypto pundit Ali Martinez took to the X platform to reveal that Ethereum investors have been moving their assets to centralized exchanges in the past 24 hours. This on-chain observation is based on the CryptoQuant exchange reserve metric, which monitors the total amount of a particular cryptocurrency on all exchanges. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Heading For A Bear Market? Analysts Weigh In On The Price Struggles Typically, the value of this metric increases when investors make more deposits than withdrawals of a token (Ether, in this case) into a centralized exchange. On the flip side, when the exchange reserve metric falls, it implies that the holders are moving their assets out of crypto exchanges. When investors move their assets from self-custodial wallets to centralized exchanges, it is often because they intend to use the platforms’ services, which include selling. As a result, an increase in the exchange reserve metric is often associated with increasing selling pressure. According to data from CryptoQuant, more than 112,000 ETH (worth around $257.6 million) were transferred to cryptocurrency exchanges in the last 24 hours. The movement of these significant Ether amounts could trigger downward pressure on the Ethereum price. Considering its delicate position at the moment, bearish circumstances, such as rising exchange inflows, could hinder the Ethereum price’s newly found momentum. Nonetheless, it is worth noting there has not been such an effect on ETH’s price in the past day. On the contrary, the altcoin is up by more than 3% while looking to breach the $2,500 level. Are Investors Fleeing The Market? The latest on-chain data shows that investors might be flooding out of the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. According to Ali Martinez, over $2.6 billion has flowed out of the two largest cryptocurrencies in the last seven days. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Whales Securing Gains After 10% Upswing: What’s Next? This revelation is based on Glassnode’s aggregate market realized value net position change metric. And it somewhat supports the earlier notion that investors might be offloading their Ether tokens.

33581531,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641921,1726333236,"PEPE Faces Potential 5% Drop, Eyes Key Support Level Retest","After a recent breakout, PEPE has experienced a notable drop as it moves to retest crucial support levels. This retest is crucial for the cryptocurrency, as it will determine whether the bullish momentum can continue or if the price will struggle to hold above this level. The aim of this article is to analyze PEPE’s recent price action as it drops to retest critical support at $0.00000766 following a breakout. It will examine whether this support level can hold and lead to a rebound, potentially setting the stage for a renewed upward trend, and explore potential scenarios for its next move. Analyzing The Current Market Condition Of PEPE On the 4-hour chart, PEPE is currently trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating a generally positive trend. However, the crypto asset is experiencing significant bearish momentum that could drive the price down toward the $0.00000766 level for a crucial retest. Additionally, on the 4-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) signal line is currently at 66%, moving down from the overbought zone toward the 50% threshold. This decline indicates increasing pessimistic momentum, suggesting a greater likelihood of PEPE approaching the $0.00000766 support level. Related Reading: PEPE Selling Pressure Surges As Price Slips Under $0.00000766 Support On the 4-hour chart, PEPE appears to be moving downward toward the $0.00000766 support level while approaching the 100-day SMA. Despite this short-term decline, the recent bullish market sentiment suggests that this drop may be temporary and could potentially lead to a rebound in the near future. Finally, the 1-day RSI signal line, which has risen to 51%, is now declining towards the 50% level. The drop in the RSI indicates a potential upward momentum weakening, reinforcing the likelihood of a price retracement to the support level for further evaluation. Evaluating PEPE’s Support Test: Can $0.00000766 Hold Firm? If $0.00000766 holds up against the selling pressure, it could indicate a potential rebound and a continuation of the upward trend toward the next resistance at $0.00001152. A successful breach of this resistance level might signal a stronger bullish move, paving the way for further price increases to even higher levels. Related Reading: Buying The Dip: PEPE Price Recovers 10% As Whales Load Their Bags However, if $0.00000766 fails to hold as support, it could lead to additional declines toward the $0.00000589 support level. Should PEPE fall below this level, it may move on to challenge the $0.00000398 range and beyond. Over the past 24 hours, PEPE traded around $0.00007822, reflecting a 6.93% increase. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalization has risen to over $3.2 billion, with trading volume surpassing $527 billion, indicating a 6.94% and 59.38% increase respectively in the past day.

33578486,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641918,1726326053,Solana Liquid Staking Could Touch $18 Billion – Will It Benefit These Altcoins?,"A new report has highlighted the key changes that could follow a significant increase in Solana liquid staking. Driven by strong investor demand, if Solana’s liquid staking were to reach $18 billion, it could significantly benefit Solana (SOL) and Jito (JTO), a liquid staking token on the Solana blockchain, potentially fueling positive momentum and a rise in the value of both altcoins. Related Reading: Get Ready For Take-Off! Shiba Inu Price To Jump 7,350% — Analyst Adoption Boom To Ignite Solana Liquid Staking Over the past few years, SOL has had an impressive run, outperforming most altcoins while leading the meme coin market with its numerous blockchain-based meme coins. However, the cryptocurrency’s Liquid Staking ratio has remained significantly low compared to Ethereum’s. Only 6.5% of Solana is staked through liquid staking, marking just one-third of Ethereum’s LSTs. In a recent report, Bybit disclosed that while Liquid Staking Tokens (LST) on the Solana blockchain did not experience immediate growth right off the bat, they are now starting to show signs of expansion and dominance in the DeFi landscape. Currently, half of the top 10 largest DeFi protocols by Total Value Locked (TVL) on Solana are now Liquid Staking providers, suggesting a rapid growth in the LST market. Additionally, the total market capitalization of LSTs on Solana has increased to $3.6 billion, reflecting a nearly 16X increase in its value from a year ago. Based on Ethereum’s LST market statistics, Bybit predicts that Solana’s LST market could potentially grow to $18 billion, representing 5X more than its current value. However, this massive surge is dependent on whether Solana’s LST ratio reaches that of Ethereum’s. Given how ambitious a $18 billion surge is, Bybit has considered it a more conservative and potentially attainable estimate. The report has suggested that if Solana’s liquid staking ratio were to grow by only 10%, it would represent a 53% increase in the size of its liquid staking market. For this to happen, Solana’s DeFi ecosystem is expected to gradually expand while the demand for LSTs on the blockchain rises. This increased demand may lead to massive adoption, attracting more developers, users and protocols to the Solana ecosystem. Furthermore, Bybit has highlighted its role in developing and improving the growth of Solana LSTs. To help drive massive adoption in Solana’s LST market and DeFi ecosystem, Bybit has announced its plans to launch its own liquid staking token on the Solana blockchain. Key Players To Gain From Solana’s Liquid Staking Growth Notably, the growth of Solana’s Liquid Staking could greatly influence the price dynamics of both SOL, Solana’s native token and JTO, the native token of Jito. A rise in Solana LSTs signals heightened adoption of the blockchain, which could attract a wave of new investors and users to SOL. This, in turn, could drive positive momentum for SOL, enabling the altcoin to potentially experience a significant price rally. Meanwhile, JTO, one of the key altcoins in the Solana LST market, stands to benefit immensely if Solana’s liquid staking reaches $18 billion. Related Reading: Blazing Solana: Analyst Foresees Nearly 700% Price Explosion With nearly $1.8 billion in staked SOL and 50% Solana LST market share, JTO is ideally positioned to capitalize on the projected growth of Solana’s Liquid staking ecosystem.

33575468,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641904,1726318859,"Shiba Inu Seen Exploding 1,000%-7,300%: Bold Predictions Signal Massive Growth","Once more making waves with some fascinating predictions is Shiba Inu (SHIB). Top trader Dexter has set an ambitious long-term target for the meme coin despite market volatility, expecting it may rise from $0.00001389 to $0.00015, which is almost a 1,000% increase. Related Reading: Blazing Solana: Analyst Foresees Nearly 700% Price Explosion SHIB is exhibiting a 1.27% growth over the previous 24 hours, and over 7% in the last week. Still, it’s not getting much traction even while the larger crypto market shows an improving trend. Analyst Krao at TradingView presents a somewhat different prediction. With a whopping 7,300% gain from its present price, Krao is hopeful that SHIB might perhaps soar to $0.001 by early 2025. His positive view rests on a fundamental technical pattern shown on the monthly chart. SHIB has been caught in a protracted decline since reaching its all-time high in October 2021 of $0.000088. A break from this declining wedge formation, according to Krao, could set off a major rally and propel SHIB skyward. Shiba Inu: Short-Term Forecast Unlike Krao’s long-term hope, CoinCodex presents a more wary short-term SHIB projection. Their study shows that the price is expected to gradually decline by 0.69%, maybe reaching $0.00001397 by October 13, 2024. With the Fear & Greed Index showing a level of anxiety at 32, the overall mood is neutral. This captures a degree of market anxiety that can affect the near-term fluctuations in SHIB. Despite this, some analysts advise that considering the possibility for future gains, now could still be a good time to buy SHIB. Current Market Sentiment Before somewhat recovering, SHIB’s price dropped into the $0.000012 area earlier this week. The token’s performance has been underwhelming on weekly and monthly bases. Its recent price path has shown more gloomy days than more hopeful ones. Apparently moving their money to other joke currencies like PEPE and Dogelon Mars, which are now outperforming SHIB, are retail investors. Dexter keeps a good perspective in front of these difficulties. He is hoping that SHIB might still eradicate another zero, so increasing its value in the next months. Having a market cap of more than $7.78 billion, SHIB is still rather prominent in the digital currency scene. Support And Resistance Dexter’s study identifies critical support areas for SHIB, mostly between $0.00001076 and $0.0000120. SHIB needs these support levels if it is to get back up and increase momentum. Should SHIB decline from these levels, it may do so significantly to $0.000007. From its present value, this possible drop would be 47%; from its annual high of $0.000045 attained in March, it would signal still another dip. Technical signs point to SHIB as at a turning point. Whether it can keep these important support levels will mostly determine its capacity for a bounce-back. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $100K? Investors Believe US Election Won’t Affect Its Rise Looking Ahead While Shiba Inu negotiates its present difficulties, different analysts present conflicting views. While Dexter’s long-term optimism and Krao’s ambitious forecasts offer a more complicated picture, CoinCodex offers a cautious short-term prognosis projecting a decline in SHIB’s price. Dexter’s optimistic long-term goal highlights a notable difference in perspective when it compared with Krao’s prognosis for a major rally These insights from CoinCodex, Dexter, and Krao should be carefully taken into account by investors assessing SHIB’s future under continuous market uncertainty.

Based on data from CoinMarketCap, The crypto market leader moved by 3.98% on Friday, capping off a rather impressive weekly performance. Commenting on this price gain, prominent blockchain analytics company Santiment has provided insight into shifting market dynamics that may result in a sustained price rally for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Health Remains ‘Net Positive’: ARK Invest Report Bitcoin Accumulation, Exchange Outflow Signal Bullish Sentiment In an X post on Friday, Santiment shared key developments in the BTC market that could encourage retail investors’ participation in the coming weeks. The on-chain analytics team reported consistent levels of massive accumulation from BTC whales and sharks. When large-scale investors such as these consistently purchase a massive amount of an asset, especially during downturns or turbulent periods, it indicates confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. 🥳 Bitcoin is within inches of regaining the coveted $60K market value for the first time since falling below back on August 29th. The dynamic duo of mid-term accumulation from sharks & whales, and falling levels of BTC on exchanges, sets the stage for crypto to roll again. pic.twitter.com/LHyxaK4Rci — Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 13, 2024 According to Santiment, Bitcoin sharks and whales i.e. wallets holding 10 BTC and above, have acquired 28,500 BTC in the last three months bringing their total holdings to 16.18 million BTC, valued at $978.29 billion. Aside from this encouraging accumulation trend, Santiment has also noted a decline in Bitcoin supply on exchanges. For context, an increase in exchange balances of an asset indicates investors are cautious and selling or preparing to sell their holdings. The opposite of such a scenario means that investors are moving their holdings to self-custodial wallets, likely in anticipation of a price rise. Based on Santiment’s report, approximately 75,000 BTC, valued at approximately $4.54 billion, has been withdrawn from exchanges in the last three months, bringing the current total exchange Bitcoin balance to $1.86 million BTC. Santiment concludes that the combination of these two factors i.e. constant accumulation by big investors and a decrease in exchanges BTC supply indicate that Bitcoin and the crypto market at large are gathering momentum for a massive price rally.

Based on on-chain tracker Whale Alert, the transaction—worth more than $85 million—has left many in the crypto community guessing about Ripple’s gameplan. Related Reading: Blazing Solana: Analyst Foresees Nearly 700% Price Explosion Ripple has been sending XRP into this wallet before, which begs questions about what the payment behemoth would do going forward. That is quite timely, considering rumors about an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) are rife. The recent announcement by Grayscale XRP Trust increased the possibility of XRP emulating Bitcoin and Ethereum in getting an ETF listing. The fact that Ripple is still in a continuous legal fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission further shrouds this issue in mystery as investors await the next developments. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 150,000,000 #XRP (85,383,318 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallethttps://t.co/uwRDwlk3LS — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) September 13, 2024 Examining The Movement According to Whale Alert data, this mysterious wallet has been receiving XRP from Ripple quite regularly since October 2023. There were some inflows and partial outflows in that account during September also. The most recent transaction is 12.08 million XRP on September 12. Before that, on September 10, there was an outflow of 40 million XRP from the account. Most interestingly, the wallet also received 200 million XRP in August, therefore increasing its already massive stash. The regular transfer of XRP into and out of this wallet has resulted in various hypotheses among XRP proponents. While some say the wallet belongs to an institutional investor, others suspect it’s Ripple consolidating money in preparation for a major announcement. Another often accepted belief is that this wallet might be used for cold storage, a preventive action to protect significant XRP quantities. ETF Speculation For XRP Grows Driven by Grayscale’s release of its XRP Trust, the move coincides with growing interest about an XRP ETF. An XRP ETF might materialize in the next eight months, according to industry analysts. Should it occur, Ripple and its native token would reach a significant turning point. But the result of Ripple’s legal fight with the SEC might affect the chronology for such innovations. Where Ripple has already scored a partial victory in the dispute against the SEC, the latter has its window till 6th October to file its appeal, and so there is still uncertainty. The case is under close observation from the investors as a favorable outcome would pave the way for more institutional investments, which may even push up the XRP price. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Seen Exploding 1,000%-7,300%: Bold Predictions Signal Massive Growth The concept of an XRP ETF has helped the market react favorably despite legal impediments. With XRP trading at $0.5612, the price surged by nearly 4% after Grayscale’s statement. This price spurt shows increasing faith in Ripple’s capacity to overcome obstacles amid regulatory pressures. Positive Sentiment Develops Around XRP XRP’s price has risen 11% over the past week; trade volumes have surged to $980 million. Its market capitalization, which indicates great interest from institutional and ordinary investors, is getting near $30 billion. Many people are asking if Ripple is preparing for a big action given the recent 150 million XRP transfer adds to the mystery.

According to a recent post by a CryptoQuant analyst known as ‘Kripto Mevsimi,’ the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has dipped below its 365-day moving average. This specific indicator often identifies potential market bottoms and zones where recovery could begin. While the drop in MVRV could suggest an “opportunity for long-term investors,” the analyst warns that caution is needed. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Leverage Ratio Hits New High: What Does This Mean BTC? Bitcoin Will Recover If Its MVRV Does This The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio is a metric used in cryptocurrency to assess whether an asset, like Bitcoin, is overvalued or undervalued relative to its “realized value.” Market Value refers to the asset’s current price multiplied by its total circulating supply, essentially the market capitalization. Realized Value is calculated by summing the value of each coin at the price it was last moved on-chain, giving a picture of what the network participants paid for their holdings. According to Mevsimi, historically, when the Bitcoin MVRV ratio breaks back above its 365-day average, it has been followed by a renewed sense of optimism in the market, often signaling the start of a “more sustainable upward trend.” However, the current economic environment, marked by ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, suggests that Bitcoin’s recovery could take longer. In the meantime, the analyst advises investors to maintain a balanced outlook, noting: Therefore, maintaining a measured and balanced perspective is essential. A positive outlook is understandable, but it should be tempered with awareness of the broader risks until the MVRV ratio confirms a more sustained upward momentum. Related Reading: 11% Of Bitcoin Supply In Coinbase’s Hands: Analyzing The Potential Risks Buy Signal Identified In BTC Meanwhile, Despite the current state of the MVRV ratio, Bitcoin’s price has shown some signs of recovery in as of today. After briefly dipping below the $58,000 mark earlier in the day, the asset has reversed its trajectory, gaining 1.2% to reach a price of $58,463 at the time of writing. Crypto analyst Mags took to X to highlight a key bullish signal: the Bitcoin hash ribbon. According to Mags, the Bitcoin hash ribbon indicator has flashed a buy signal, historically one of the “most reliable” indicators for Bitcoin’s price movement. Mags mentioned that every time this signal appeared, it was followed by a significant price surge, giving traders reason to believe that Bitcoin could see a bullish breakout soon. #Bitcoin – hash ribbon flashed a buy signal.

Following the migration, the new token’s price struggled to gain momentum, failing to reclaim the $0.39 resistance level. However, Binance’s recent listing of POL has pumped its price above key levels. Related Reading: POPCAT Jumps 20% As Whales Load Their Bags, Is A ‘Cat Season’ Ahead? Binance Completes Polygon Token Migration On Friday morning, global exchange Binance completed the token migration from MATIC to POL. The exchange had stated it would support Polygon’s token swap by delisting all MATIC trading pairs and suspending deposits and withdrawals on September 10. Additionally, the platform revealed it would add POL spot trading pairs on September 13, at 10:00 (UTC). The pairs included POL/BNB, POL/BRL, POL/BTC, POL/ETH, POL/EUR, POL/FDUSD, POL/JPY, POL/TRY, POL/USDC, and POL/USDT. Polygon’s token migration on September 4 marked a “critical juncture” for the network, aiming to enhance utility and align with “the vision as an aggregated network of blockchains.” The upgrade seeks to improve the platform’s tokenomics to make it more attractive for users and validators. Moreover, POL will serve as a “hyperproductive token,” acting as the native gas and staking token on Polygon and supporting its “future expansion and security as an aggregated network.” After delisting MATIC, Binance announced the completion of the token swap, listing Polygon’s new token on Friday. The global exchange also unveiled that POL would be added to Binance Simple Earn, “Buy Crypto”, and Binance Convert. Binance Margin and futures services would also become available for POL investors on September 13. Meanwhile, Binance Auto-Invest will be available on September 16 at 10:00 (UTC). POL Price’s Parabolic Surge Following its listing on Binance, Polygon’s new token saw a massive surge. POL had been hovering between the $0.38-$0.35 price range since September 3, edging close to its all-time low (ATL) of $0.345 registered over a month ago. Despite Polygon’s upgrade, the token struggled to break above the $0.39 resistance level, worrying investors and market watchers. However, POL jumped 17.3% on Friday, breaking above the $0.4 mark for the first time in ten days. The token also saw a massive increase in daily activity, seemingly fueled by the listing. POL registered a daily trading volume of $135 million, soaring 700% in the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization also surged 17%, hitting the $3.16 billion mark on Friday morning. Some market watchers noted POL’s performance, praising Polygon’s upgrade. DeFi analyst DeFyist considered Polygon’s the “first successful big token migration we’ve seen in a while.” To the analyst, the upgrade displayed why “new charts are more important” as the token was “lifted on the fresh perp listing” despite the spot migration having happened already. Related Reading: Failed Solana Token Scheme? Hacker Targets 2.6 Million Indian Cricket Fans With X Scam Another pseudonym analyst considered it an “example of why a ‘new chart’ matters.” To Cilinix, if the token successfully reclaims the $0.44 resistance level, it could be up for a bullish run. As of this writing, POL is trading at $0.433, a 16.6% surge in the last 24 hours.

Faibik emphasized that a daily candle close above $60,000 would be crucial for pushing Bitcoin toward new highs by December. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Heading For A Bear Market?

Woo suggests that while Bitcoin is not technically in a bear market, the digital asset is in a “re-accumulation” phase, a period of consolidation that could signal a potential move toward new all-time highs. Woo emphasizes that, in the short term, a bullish swing could occur within the next 1-3 weeks, but more time is needed for Bitcoin to break above previous all-time highs. As for the medium term, Woo pointed out that since the halving event in April, Bitcoin’s demand and supply signals have been bearish, though recent weeks have shown signs of a potential reversal. However, these signals are still “unconfirmed,” it could take more time for Bitcoin to push toward a new all-time high. Moreover, macroeconomic conditions could significantly influence Bitcoin’s price movement. Woo referenced the dropping bond rates as a potential risk signal for traditional financial markets.

Utilizing data from The Block and CoinShares, I suspect over $1 billion in investment capital has left BTC. Network metrics and election uncertainty potentially explain the capital flow problem. However, seasonality for BTC, and by extension GBTC, should bode well through Q4. As BTC-proxy, GBTC works and will likely rise with price appreciation in the coin. But that's the only real reason to hold GBTC at this juncture. In my last Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) article from early-July, I noted the state of investment capital flows and what was a historically favorable seasonality story for the month of July: July has actually been the second best month for GBTC after only October going back the last five years. Four of the five preceding Julys have resulted in a positive return for GBTC shareholders. Following that article, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rallied 30% from a July 5th low of $53.5k up to $70k on July 9th. Since then, price action has been highly disappointing to say the least with the coin now 12% under my buy call: Data by YCharts If July is generally good for BTC, August and September have held up to their historical norms as well so far. In this article, we'll briefly look at what seasonality says about BTC through the fourth quarter of the year, gauge any signals that can be derived from capital flows, and assess key network metrics through August. Bitcoin Seasonality As of article submission, we're just a couple of days from the halfway point of September. Though well off the lows of $52.5k, BTC is indeed still behind the August close near $59k per coin. This holds true to what we would generally expect from seasonality over the last decade. Looking ahead, we have a very favorable setup approaching with October: BTC Monthly Seasonality (TrendSpider) With an 80% win rate going back to 2014, October is historically one of the best months of the year for BTC. The mean change in the month is 19%. Q4 has generally been a good time to let BTC positions run. Mean change in November is 7% and December is 9%, though win rate is lower and returns are a bit more volatile to close the year. Capital Flow Story There are a couple different metrics we can observe to ascertain how capital is moving in or out of Bitcoin. First, investment product data from CoinShares shows September off to a very bad start for the broader digital asset investment landscape: Weekly Crypto Investment Flow (CoinShares) For the week ended September 7th, CoinShares data has $726 million worth of investment capital coming out of digital asset products, which matches the worst week of the year from March. 89% of that outflow was from Bitcoin products, making BTC investment flow negative so far through the first week of September by $640 million. If data from The Block is any indication, it seems that outflow from BTC products may perhaps continue in CoinShares' next report: US Spot ETF Supply (The Block) On September 7th, there was 920.7k BTC held through US spot Bitcoin ETFs. As of September 12th, that figure was down to 913.3k BTC in those same funds. 7.4k BTC at an average price of $58k per coin would be nearly $430 million in additional outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs a week following one of the coin's worst capital flow weeks of the year. This is clearly not a great sign if you want to see higher BTC prices. Network Metrics As each halving cycle progresses, Bitcoin's network fees will become an increasingly more important part of transaction validation. While high fees price out lower value transactions, miner incentivization will ultimately require a robust fee market. Thus, monthly fees are an important metric to watch going forward: Monthly Fees vs MC (Token Terminal) In August, we observe total fees of $20.7 million. This was the lowest monthly fee total for Bitcoin of the year, but slightly ahead of the $17.2 million fee figure recorded from the same month last year. The larger takeaway here is Bitcoin is clearly experiencing summer doldrums from an activity standpoint, and we see that corroborated by usage numbers. Users vs Transactions (Token Terminal) DAUs - which Token Terminal defines as 'distinct senders' - in the month of August moved up slightly to 365.7k from 347.9k in July. The bad news is this figure was down 43% from 641.5k last August. However, even as users have declined, there were 18.5 million transactions in August. This is the second highest ever after July's 19.5 million and a 28% year-over-year increase from 14.4 million in August last year. I won't speculate as to the reason we're seeing what we're seeing. But I'll sum it by saying more transactions from fewer users generating fewer fees is not a sustainable long-term trend. Election-Related Weakness? One headwind potentially plaguing crypto and, more specifically, Bitcoin is the uncertainty pertaining to what will happen in the November election in the US. I have explored some of the exuberant Bitcoin reserve proposals we saw from political figures at Bitcoin 2024 in an article from late-July . I'll take some of my thinking a bit further for this section. In my personal view, it seems quite clear that one of the major political parties in the United States has taken a far more combative stance on cryptocurrencies and digital assets. We could certainly debate whether or not the other party is seizing the opportunity to pander to voters, but at the end of the day, we can only judge actions rather than words. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission under the Biden administration, through its actions, has developed a reputation in the industry as being an agency that is regulating the space by enforcement, ignoring legitimate frauds, attacking the good actors in the space, and pushing entrepreneurs offshore. On the other hand, the former President running for the other party is actively using the technology through chains like Polygon ( MATIC-USD ). Thus, the industry believes a Harris/Walz administration is bad for crypto and a Trump/Vance administration would be good. US President Betting Odds (Polymarket) In response to the August 10th Presidential debate, the betting markets are currently giving the Harris/Walz ticket the edge over Trump/Vance. For this exercise, I'm using Polymarket data rather than ElectionBettingOdds.com. The latter of which aggregates data from Polymarket and three additional markets. The reason I'm choosing the Polymarket figure is because at $900 million in wagers, Polymarket's betting action is 7x that of the other three markets combined. In my view, this is the better read on what the liquid market thinks - and the market thinks Vice President Harris has a slight edge. I suspect this is another key reason why we haven't yet seen strong, sustainable rallies in the broader digital asset market. Coupled with what I'd call less than exciting network data, the election as a potential headwind likely explains some of the capital flight we're seeing this month. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust At 1.5% annually, GBTC continues to have the largest expense ratio in the spot ETF market. Recently, Grayscale spun out the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ( BTC ) using a portion of the AUM that was previously held through GBTC. By comparison, the 0.15% fee with BTC is a far more palatable fee and, at this point, I don't see much of a reason to hold GBTC at all. Revisiting this chart again from a prior section: US Spot ETF Supply (The Block) The fee flight from GBTC has clearly slowed down, but it is still happening. Each trading session that passes, more BTC-denominated AUM comes out of GBTC, and the fund has now lost more than 63% of its assets since it was converted to an ETF in January. If the price of Bitcoin goes up, GBTC will as well. It's that simple. Other than that, I don't think GBTC is worth holding for long-term Bitcoin exposure unless the expense ratio comes down to where the rest of the market is. In spite of what I view to be an uncompetitive product, I believe BTC is a buy and will maintain my buy rating on GBTC as an extension of that belief. Closing Thoughts Ultimately, this is really the reason why I'm still bullish BTC long term despite its flaws: US Public Debt to GDP Ratio (LongTermTrends.net) US debt to GDP is at WW2 levels. For years, we've been told this isn't an issue because rates are so low. That's no longer the case: Rates vs Interest (FRED) Rates are expected to come down soon. Where they ultimately end up is not a forecast I'm comfortable making today. But what is clear is at current levels, the interest expense on the debt is already exploding. This is essentially the only chart a Bitcoin bull really needs, in my opinion. Just as much as Gold or Silver, Bitcoin is an asset that can be taken out of the traditional financial system. Each individual must decide for themselves what the right allocation to each of these assets is. From where I sit, zero percent is too low, and that's true for all of them. We're nearing the end of what has historically been poor seasonality for BTC and for risk assets in general. The election may still be a hurdle, but I suspect BTC wins long term no matter which candidate is elected because neither seem motivated to address the federal deficit.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4721065-gbtc-capital-flows-and-network-data-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33562430.jpeg

Bitcoin Positive Vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio Has Spiked Recently According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, the crowd has recently shown a sudden burst of optimism around Bitcoin. The indicator of relevance here is the “Positive Sentiment vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio,” which, as its name suggests, keeps track of the ratio between the positive and negative comments on social media related to a given coin. Related Reading: Legendary Bitcoin Puell Multiple Finally Enters ‘Buy’ Territory The analytics firm sources posts/threads/messages from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, and 4Chan. To determine whether these posts are negative or positive, Santiment puts them through a machine-learning model. When the indicator has a value greater than 1, the comments related to positive sentiment outweigh the negative ones. On the other hand, being under the threshold suggests that most social media users share a negative sentiment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Positive Sentiment vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio for the top two coins in the sector, Bitcoin and Ethereum, over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, a huge spike in positive sentiment vs. negative sentiment was observed for Bitcoin after the latest cryptocurrency recovery. The peak of this spike has corresponded to twice as many positive posts as negative ones cropping up on the major social media platforms. This is the first time the indicator has reached such a high level. While this indicates that the investors feel bullish about the asset, the optimism scale could be concerning. This is because BTC has historically tended to go against the expectations of the majority, with the probability of a contrary move rising, the more sure the crowd has become of a direction. Since the positive sentiment has exploded after only a mild jump in the price, FOMO may be taking over the market a bit too soon. This could lead to a potential top for Bitcoin. As for when BTC’s fates might turn bullish again, the analytics firm says: Look for traders to “slow their roll” and start to express FUD again. When the crowd begins conveying doubt again, BTC will truly begin testing its March all-time high market values. Related Reading: Which Altcoins Could Skyrocket Next?

The analyst also suggested that Cardano was halfway to reaching a new high, noting what part of its cycle the coin was currently at. Cardano Is In Stage 3 Of Its Cycle Gambardello remarked in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Cardano is in stage three of its cycle. He claimed that this part of the cycle for ADA is the “Told you. You should’ve listened” stage. This refers to the point where investors begin to capitulate, thinking that the crypto is unlikely to surge in the bull market given its bearish price action. Related Reading: XRP Price To Crash To $0.33 Before Surge To $9 Post-SEC Appeal; Analyst Reveals Once this stage is done, Cardano is expected to move to the next stage of its cycle, which Gambardello called the “Here we go again, another bull trap” stage. This stage will help shake out the short-term traders who jumped on ADA, believing its price would rise soon enough. Once the non-believers have been shaken out, the analyst predicts that Cardano will move to the last part of its cycle, when it will shatter its ATH and reach new highs. In his accompanying chart, Gambardello predicted that Cardano would rise to as high as $15 by year-end 2025. The analyst also indicated that ADA will enjoy a price surge beyond 2025, expected to mark the end of this cycle’s bull run. Interestingly, he forecasts that Cardano’s price will double in a year and rise to $31 by year-end 2026. A rise to $31 means that Cardano will have a market cap of $1 trillion. For context, the crypto market currently has a market cap of $2 trillion, meaning that figure is set to increase exponentially if ADA alone becomes valued at $1 trillion. The analyst didn’t provide any reason for believing the crypto can experience such massive growth in two years. A More Conservative Price Prediction Crypto analyst InvestingHaven has offered a more conservative price prediction for Cardano. In an X post, the analyst stated that the crypto will reach a “super bullish target of $1.95” in 2025. He also questioned whether ADA was ready for a breakout, claiming that the $0.443 Fibonacci level was the key to unlocking higher prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms Golden Cross On 2-Month Chart, Here’s What Happened Last Time InvestingHaven added that the 2025 outlook for Cardano is full of potential, reaffirming that this is when the crypto will enjoy a parabolic rally. ADA has had a rough 2024 despite bullish developments like the Chang Hard Fork, which ushered in a decentralized governance system for the Cardano network.
