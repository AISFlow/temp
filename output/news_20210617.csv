42406605,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAex6sr,1623970068,Paying the IRON Price: Fractional Reserve Banking on a Blockchain,"Today saw the meltdown of Iron Finance, issuer of a supposed “stablecoin” called IRON that is now worth a lot less than the dollar it's supposed to be pegged to. That’s obviously bad, since the entire point of a stablecoin is to be stable.      Stablecoins are important. They're widely used by crypto speculators and day-traders as supposedly safe places to park their money between trades, without the hassle and expense of converting to dollars. That demand has made the category competitive, and Iron’s collapse is a big black eye, not just for its creators, but for other tokens that take a similar approach – what are broadly known as “algorithmic” stablecoins.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    Algorithmic stablecoins are one of at least three varieties. Fiat-backed stablecoins such as Circle’s USDC are fully backed up by traditional currency. A second category is crypto-backed stablecoins, such as MakerDAO’s DAI. Dai is overcollateralized to increase stability in the event of a crypto crash (which creates some problems of its own).      (Tether, somehow the most widely-used stablecoin, is in a messy category by itself.)      Finally, algorithmic stablecoins use less than one-to-one backing and a complex web of automated transactions and issuances to maintain a price peg. The details of these systems are spectacularly arcane.      Iron Finance's stablecoin (IRON) was 75% backed by USDC, which is fully backed by dollars. The other 25% of backing was provided by TITAN, a “share token” or “balancer token” also created by Iron Finance itself. The Titan token was burned or printed as needed to maintain Iron’s one-dollar peg. (The Daily Gwei has a more detailed breakdown of the IRON system.)      Other algorithmic stablecoins may be more sophisticated or robust than what Iron built, but most use a similar multi-token system. You may begin to see the intractable core problem: In very broad terms, these projects are fractional reserve banks. Bitcoiners and other “hard money” advocates loathe fractional reserve banking like vampires loathe garlic because of the risk of exactly the sort of catastrophe that hit Iron.    Read more: In Token Crash Postmortem, Iron Finance Says It Suffered Crypto’s ‘First Large-Scale Bank Run’    Things went south for Iron starting overnight Wednesday when the value of the Titan share token fell from $65 to $60 – and then quickly to what I’ll just call “effectively zero.” The drop was so sharp in part because, once Titan fell just slightly too low, the incentives behind the stablecoin became perverse, creating an arbitrage opportunity that was ruthlessly exploited. The role of an arbitrage parallels the fall of the English pound’s peg in the late Eighties, and it will be interesting to find out who made the George Soros money in this crypto-replay.      Iron’s creators attempted to not only justify, but seemingly to glorify their failure by claiming in a postmortem that “we just experienced the world’s first large-scale crypto bank run.” To which I would say two things: a) No, you didn’t, and b) those words don’t mean what you seem to think they mean.      First of all, the “world’s first large-scale crypto bank run” happened in 2014, when customers around the world struggled frantically to get a total of 850,000 BTC out of Mt. Gox, an early bitcoin exchange. Those were worth about $425 million at the time, or roughly $33 billion at today’s prices. And customers were right to scramble: despite calming assurances from those in charge, Mt. Gox really didn’t have their money. Most of it was lost in an apparent hack, and as of January 2021, only about 23% of depositors' bitcoin has been recovered.      It's not clear how much Iron holders have lost, but the protocol at its peak had $2 billion in collateral on its books. Even if all of that’s gone, compared to Gox, those are rookie numbers.      There is another difference here. Mt. Gox actually had the money at some point, then lost it. But the entire point of Iron and other algorithmic stablecoins is that the money isn’t really there in the first place: no matter the complex rules for burning or printing Titan, Iron was still a dollar-denominated token backed only 75% by anything resembling dollars. This was ultimately why a slight price fluctuation led to death-spiral panic-selling: Everyone wanted to get out before the bottom of the barrel was in sight.      So, just as with Mt. Gox – and despite what Iron Finance argues in its aw-shucks-non-apology – this bank run didn’t cause the collapse of the system. Here’s a fantastic quote on the subject from banking economist George Kaufman:      “The fable is that a run can bring down a solvent bank. What a run does is: It causes an insolvent bank to be recognized as insolvent.”      Kaufman wasn’t talking about Mt. Gox or Iron, but about Enron, a company that was essentially one very big leverage-driven scam from the bottom to the top. Through its masterful (and evil) manipulation of equity and accounting rules, Enron spent more than a decade propping up its stock price by essentially printing its own money, in the form of varieties of stock in itself and subsidiaries.      It used that money, in various arcane maneuvers, to buy parts of itself from other parts of itself, then book those sales as revenue reported to Wall Street. This is how Enron’s revenue and stock managed to grow at an impressive and steady pace. It was all fake, and eventually that became clear to the public.      Are all algorithmic stablecoins subject to the same risk? Can you print your own money, then move it around in a sophisticated enough way that it somehow becomes worth 25% of an actual dollar? I remain willing to be convinced. But until that happens, my personal assumption is that algorithmic stablecoins are basically magic beans. Mark Cuban now wants them regulated, but in the meantime, you can protect yourself from another “classic bank run” by simply steering clear.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,David Z.

Scammers are sending fake hardware wallets to people whose data was gathered via a third-party data breach. These fake wallets contain hardware designed to steal the user's crypto.      The scam is an ambitious one. First appearing in May, the scammers mailed packages that contained a fake Ledger Nano wallet to the homes of Ledger users. They soldered a flash drive onto the interior of the fake wallet, and the packages also included a sealed bag with Ledger’s logo on it, and even shrink-wrapping the box itself, to appear as if it were never opened.      In a Ledger blog post Thursday explaining the scam, the company said the box includes a fake letter explaining the “need to replace your existing hardware wallet to secure your funds. This is a scam. The Ledger Nano is fake.”    Read more: Ledger Adds Bitcoin Bounty and New Data Security After Hack    A flash drive with a fake Ledger app is connected to the circuit board, and instructions enclosed with the device tell the recipient to plug in the wallet and run the malicious file. To initialize the device, the user is then asked for their 24-word recovery phrase.      That phrase could then be used to generate the wallet’s private keys, letting the scammer import a wallet and gain access to the funds.      “We are aware of this scam, which we have included in our list of ongoing malicious attacks listed on our website,” Ledger Chief Information Security Officer Matt Johnson told CoinDesk in an email. “You should be suspicious of receiving a free product in the mail that you didn’t order and check Ledger’s official channels or contact Ledger support team.”      Johnson added that Ledger and Ledger Live will never ask users to share their 24-word recovery phrase, that Ledger communicates securely through Ledger Live, never by mail or phone, and that the company would never mail anything to a user's address without their consent.

Assets deemed to be risky like stocks and crypto also appear to be weighed down by lingering concerns that the Fed may wind down its bond-buying program sooner than expected.      Some analysts, however, expect bitcoin to remain resilient if inflation continues to rise, which could lead to outperformance versus traditional markets.      In a newsletter published on Wednesday, EQUOS, a digital asset financial services company, described the initial down move across risk assets as a “knee-jerk reaction.”      “Bitcoin and stocks will likely correlate through the turbulence, before reality hits: Inflation is likely to see bitcoin outperform stocks,” EQUOS wrote.    Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC) $37546.2 -2.45%  Ether (ETH) $2326.63, -3.75%  S&P 500: 4221.86, -0.04 %  Gold $1772.94, -2.19%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.52%    The chart below shows the 90-day correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 has risen so far this year.      “Past bitcoin bull market cycles have tended to occur alongside year-over-year increases in the core CPI (consumer price index).... and bear market cycles have come as CPI has rolled over,” David Grider, head of digital assets research at research firm Fundstrat, wrote in a newsletter published on Wednesday.      Bitcoin is widely considered an inflation hedge, but it may just be that the cryptocurrency benefits from loose monetary policy that has occurred around periods of high inflation, according to Grider.      That could change if the Fed decides to wind down, or taper, its program of purchasing $120 billion worth of bonds per month – a form of monetary-policy easing known as quantitative easing, or QE – in response to higher inflation.      “We expect that the Fed will announce no later than December that QE will be tapered beginning next January,” MRB Partners wrote in a newsletter Wednesday.    Bitcoin negative funding rate    Since May, the cost to fund long positions in the market for bitcoin perpetual swaps, a type of derivative in the cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets, has been in negative territory. Such a scenario sometimes precedes spot price recoveries.    Small holders on the rise    Entities holding less than one bitcoin own almost 5% of the total supply distribution, according to data from Glassnode. That suggests an increasing presence of smaller players in the bitcoin market.    Titan stablecoin collapse    Iron Titanium token (TITAN), the share token of a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has fallen to near zero from $60 in one day, bringing the worth of the protocol down from $2 billion at one point to near zero.      The token was designed to boot a partially collateralized stablecoin known as IRON, which was pegged to $1. Users may mint new IRON stablecoins by locking up 25% in TITAN and 75% in USDC.      On Wednesday, TITAN’s price fell dramatically as large investors started selling their holdings. Iron Finance, founder of the decentralized finance (DeFi) project, called the sale “the world’s first large-scale crypto bank run.”      With the peg becoming unstable, IRON holders started exchanging the tokens for USDC, and TITAN, which further increased the supply of TITAN and added its selling pressure, economist Frances Coppola noted on Twitter.      “The collapse of TITAN is like the Weimar hyperinflation – or indeed any FX crisis involving a hard peg. When the value of your own currency is collapsing, you have to print more and more of it to meet your obligations in another currency,” Coppola wrote, referring to the Weimar Republic, which is what the post-World War I German government was called. The country experienced hyperinflation during that time.      Billionaire investor Mark Cuban, who once described his enthusiasm for DeFi products such as TITAN, said he also lost money from the panic selling. In a letter to Bloomberg, he said regulations should be put in place.      “I think the lesson is not necessarily, Let’s be afraid now of trading any of the DeFi or any of the currencies,” Michele Schneider, a markets analyst at MarketGauge Group, told CoinDesk.    Altcoin roundup  In addition to retail investors, an increasing number of institutions and large investors are flocking to Polygon. At the beginning of June, about 65% of daily stablecoin transaction volume on Polygon came from transactions with values above $1 million, according to data compiled by blockchain data research firm Nansen.

Right now 2021 is 2014 and crypto is the new FANG. Since 2014, the FANG stocks of Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet) outperformed and investing in them was the “dumb investment strategy” that actually worked. There is no need to form a micro thesis if macro generates handsome returns.    Matti Gagliardi is a partner at Zee Prime Capital.    At some point, when everyone is too macro, the magic ceases to work. But until then a way to frame this investment thesis would be: “Following the crowd” is “the new contrarian.” Imitation runs amok.      The crypto supercycle is welcoming and invites everyone to join and compete. Anyone can become a viable competitor and make it. Anyone can put laser eyes on their Twitter profile photo and become a multi-millionaire.      Peter Thiel has said bitcoin is the new FANG because the digital asset will be macro driven (as are most things) in the next few years. I would extend the thesis to crypto as an asset class.      Just like AI, cryptois an abstraction. No one really knows what it means anymore. Hiding behind abstractions is seen as bad when you’re building products. Obscuring reality could be useful when you’re trying to get people to discuss the product.      Cryptois a powerful meme outsiders treat as this mystical phenomenon insiders try to sell them. It’s been reduced to trigger words and phrases such as “the future” and “number go up.”      In a way, crypto is similar to God. The less people know about it, the more forms and shapes it can take in the future. The more vague your God is, the easier it is to push it onto others. Only then will you start to unpack all the nuances of commandments and form a religion. And then others will disagree with that nuance and branch out.      Crypto is not a monolith. In 2021, it encompasses many different ecosystems, memes, technologies and beliefs. Decentralized finance (DeFi) has in recent months become one of the dominant movements within crypto, with ambitions to go mainstream.    Read more: Opinion: The Reflexivity of ‘Number Go Up’ Technology    Institutional investors treat DeFi with the same suspicion it treated FANG stocks a decade ago. While venture capitalist firms were saying “it’s users that matter,” Wall Street power brokers shook their heads in disbelief over lack of revenue: “It’s nice that Facebook has users but how are you going to make money?” Such a boomer thing to say.      When the ad-generated revenue started to pile up many former critics FOMOed in. For some it was too late to attain that illusory 10x. Investors do not want to make the same mistake twice.      DeFi might, to some extent, follow the FANG pattern. Total value locked (TVL) in DeFi could become what users were during the internet’s growth phase, a metric that turned out to be a future cash flow-generating machine. In fact, DeFi apps actually generate fees and revenue. Could this be a place to park billions and billions in cash?      DeFi is a perfect product market fit for the economy running on infinite money. The nature of DeFi revenue is self-serving, but so is the nature of modern monetary policy. As long as interest rates are low, the sky's the limit. Inflation forecasting could fuel a regime transition in finance and the new economy becomes an exit strategy for the old economy.    Welcome to 2021    Many have seen discussions of supercycles as a symptom of market euphoria. But there might be more to it.      Crypto markets will likely remain cyclical. Bouts of volatility will persist in the decade ahead and possibly beyond. If a product market fit for a particular app or crypto is on the horizon, the speculation around it will serve as a stress-testing mechanism, especially if the product's ambition is to replace an old technology.      The bull market of 2016-2017 led to a mass of startups in crypto. The four years since has transformed nebulous white papers into products that we can deploy, test and use. There are users and products and product market fit is being formed.      In 2017, we had one product; a global permissionless fundraising mechanism (also known as initial coin offerings, or ICO). In 2021, there are many more including permissionless trading and lending, the ability to create derivatives and, more generally, an ability to deploy financial instruments and be a banker from one’s bedroom.      Both macro and micro factors play into crypto’s hands. Speculation is eating the world and the Gamestop vs. Wall Street saga shows us the new dimension of democratizing finance. People want capital and they’re finding new ways of accessing it.      The old economy pushes people towards entities like universities or banks. These institutions are a way of attaining wealth via distribution. On the other side there is permissionless finance. The way forward is “to innovate in the devices of economic decentralization so that more people can have more access to more markets in more ways,” philosopher Roberto Mangabeira Unger once told Peter Thiel.      People do not hate capital. Many journalists, academics and politicians chase a false narrative of class resentment. The opposite is true – people simply want more of it. They just want tendies.    The next great unbundling    There are two ways to capture value in the market – to bundle and unbundle. Thompson’s ""Great Unbundling"" explains how the internet disrupted distribution of media content by creating a new point of integration. The internet enabled us to build a new value chain based on innovation that creates a new point of integration. Everyone aligns to a new focal point. The winner bundles and everyone unbundles around it.      The internet lowered media distribution cost to zero. The old media monopoly on distributing content and advertisements was shattered. This is an example of how innovation-broke, status quo organizations optimized for low transfer costs. Market forces unleashed by innovation created new bundles.      Facebook broke the “distribution-based monopoly on customer attention” by integrating consumers and advertising, building a new bundle and a new monopoly on attention.      Crypto, and DeFi in particular, also created a new integration point. Blockchains such as Ethereum enabled consumers to participate directly in the new monetary regime. No need for a bank that enjoys exclusive access to the central bank.      DeFi dapps can do everything a bank does. Some of these services will not be decentralized but will operate on the decentralized financial stack.    Read more: ‘Weird DeFi’ Gets Weirder    For the Revoluts and Robinhoods of the world, tapping into decentralized finance is just a matter of integration. Their back ends will be upgraded from the old economy to the DeFi stack. This is how financial institutions will adjust to the new paradigm. This is the supercycle.    Infinite leverage    Naval Ravikant provides a succinct explanation of technological leverage:    “The most interesting and the most important form of leverage is this idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. This is the new form of leverage.”    One is able to reach millions of people with just a microphone and internet connection. Most modern leverage boils down to the internet and code – at no marginal cost.      Tech startups are leverage machines because, as Naval Ravikant writes, they combine “the minimum but highest output labor that you can get, which are engineers, designers and product developers. Then you add in capital.”      This combination can yield big returns paired with extreme volatility and long tail distributions. New forms of leverage are permissionless.There are three things I would like to address in terms of modern leverage.    Leverage cuts both ways; a huge civilizational upside comes with a downside  With the availability of leverage, malleability increases (or, potentially, fragility)  Permissionless finance is the pinnacle of internet leverage because capital becomes more liquid and can be widely owned  Cutting both ways    The era of the internet is an era of infinite leverage that allows one to join three commas clubs in a matter of months. On the other hand, you easily leverage yourself to an absolute epistemic decay by subscribing to a YouTube channel that discusses edgy conspiracy theories and falling down the rabbit hole. The greater the leverage available the greater the potential inequality gap.    Malleability    Malleability is a function of reflexivity. The more malleable the world becomes, the less robust it is. Reflexivity itself is fueled by technological and financial leverage. Building our world through leverage introduces inherent fragility.    Permissionless finance    Permissionless finance is an ultimate leverage because it enables almost anyone to access markets and create financial instruments on a whim. This forces an upgrade on the knowledge economy. As a result, the innovation loops might get rapidly shorter as finance becomes gamified.      We already see teenage developers actively participating in DeFi. The new bankers are basically gamers. The same way the media was dismantled by the internet, permissionless finance will disrupt finance.      This is what “unbanking” means. The illusory credential barrier between pros and amateurs will melt.    Outcomes    This does not necessarily lead to just good outcomes. The greater the equality of opportunity, the greater the inequality of outcome. Becoming a billionaire from your mom's basement will inherently increase relative inequality.      The supercycle is overreaching beyond our wildest dreams. Everything will be “super”: the wins, the losses, the volatility and potentially the difference between losers and winners. The conclusion to the supercycle is unpredictable, with either a dystopia or a utopia awaiting.    The utopia of a new agricultural revolution    Crypto becoming the new FANG is a real option. The birth of a new asset class represents an opportunity to transition into a new economy. What happens today in crypto or DeFi is not totally without precedent.      The U.S. agricultural revolution in the mid to late 19th century was a prosperous era that led to the ascent of the United States. This period of prosperity started by distributing land, creating a new asset class of farmland and new stakes.      Then came the establishment of land grant colleges focusing “on the teaching of practical agriculture, science, military science, and engineering."" This enabled sharing knowledge and broadened the number of eligible participants. New legal and financial devices, like crop insurance, were invented.      This revolution was a result of technological innovation paired with institutional innovation. The question is if digital assets can provide a similar stimulus.      Digital assets are capital. Some DeFi assets could be framed as productive capital with actual revenue and yield. If the adoption of these new capital assets is paired with education, the unbundling of finance at large will follow.    A dystopian alternative    The more things change the more they remain the same. Permissionless finance inherits the flaws of the old economy. In this version of the future we will face the same old problems but with new names.      Crypto is often interpreted as a revolution where the ""little man"" thrives. It’s possible the little man will, well, remain little. Crypto could be a mere regime change rather than a full-blown revolution.      DeFi is permissionless on the surface, but there are skills needed to play the game – a sort of permission. People with a particular set of skills can thrive in this system, even from their parents' basement. But does it lead to more equality in outcome?      Some describe DeFi or crypto in general as an instrument that will liberate. This perspective says it will merely enable a regime transition and formation of a new financial elite with marginal improvements for others. The insiders joined by the old financial elite will be heralding a revolution.      The Coinbase offering is a hallmark of the new economy trying to establish itself in the old economy crowd. Crypto trying to legitimize itself could be more dangerous than operating as a subversive force on the sideline. Will crypto face a similar ideological reversal to that of Google? Remember, the world’s greatest ad company used to be against advertisements.    Sacrificial ends    Just like tech stocks in the last decade, crypto may attract a lot of financial capital. Given that the signal travels faster these days, retail participation will be significant. The liquid nature of this obscure new asset class is a beguiling call to riches that is hard to resist.      Since its inception crypto felt like the promised land from the inside and the club of the damned from the outside. This is slowly changing. The kinetic energy in forms of radically subversive ideas have been channeled into a potential energy in the form of cypherpunk startups building DeFi and crypto.      The new economy is bubbling underneath the old, ready to reshape the world. The supercycle may as well be called a hypercycle. The IT revolution will finally enable full digital age transition in the current Roaring 20s, losing its subversive roots in an attempt to legitimize and establish itself.    Read more: Why Care About Bitcoin? Here’s One Philosopher’s Take    The new economy will serve the old economy, finally providing a transition into the digital age in which value is embedded into the computer program. It's the same battle as in the early 2000s but with an alternate ending: the new prevails as we enter the long-awaited deployment phase of the digital era.      But the supercycle will require great sacrifice.

During his speech at the Future of FinTech Conference on Thursday, Tom Mutton gave attendees an overview of the Bank of England’s current standing on CBDCs. Much of Mutton’s speech reiterated the bank’s noncommittal interest in the development of a CBDC and its purported commitment to keeping cash “available for as long as [people] wish to use it.” However, he also addressed feedback from a 2020 survey on CBDCs done by the bank.      Mutton provided the Bank of England’s counterpoints to concerns raised in the survey, including the need to preserve privacy, increase public trust and ensure equitable access to the technology.      He also addressed the concerns around energy and the environment, saying:    “Bitcoin, given its performance shortcomings and energy inefficiency, is in no way a relevant comparison for the sort of technology we might use in a central bank digital currency.”    Mutton urged eco-conscious U.K. citizens not to “throw the blockchain baby out with the bitcoin bathwater.”      Mutton’s remarks come as bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies are being hotly debated for their impact on the environment. As companies like Tesla reverse their stance on bitcoin payments due to concerns over bitcoin mining's carbon footprint, central banks are pressured to consider the environmental impact of CBDCs – even theoretical ones like the Bank of England’s.      According to Mutton, the Bank of England’s CBDC could play a role in the country’s transition to a net-zero economy. To do so, Mutton stressed, energy efficiency should be a core consideration in the design of the CBDC and should come with data and analytics technology that will allow the central bank to optimize the financial system to be as energy efficient as possible.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/17/bank-of-england-any-uk-cbdc-will-be-tens-of-thousands-times-more-efficient-than-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c0c7896d619bb2c26d5a612a7a4acf953daa7c2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some of the parks have received the notice and are expecting another official document on Friday, according to BlockBeats’ report , citing unnamed miners.    A third report by Chinese crypto blogger Colin Wu saidhttps://www.wu-talk.com/kuaixun/5843.html mining activities in some parts of Sichuan province have been suspended for inspection.    It remains unclear if the crackdown on crypto mining in the city will spread to other parts of Sichuan province. Ya’an is one of the province’s hydro-rich areas, where Chinese crypto miners can enjoy cheap electricity during China’s rainy season.      The move came on the heels of the crackdown on another hydro-based mining hub, Yunnan province, over the last weekend. Xinjiang, Inner Mongoli and Qinghai have also ordered mining operations to shutter.      CoinDesk hasn't been able to independently verify the accuracy of the three reports. The Ya’an Municipal People’s Government didn't respond to requests for comment.

42406619,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAex71i,1623951063,Curve DAO Contemplates Its Intellectual Property,"Hydrosam, a trained lawyer and Curve token holder, did what all enterprising lawyers do when they’re annoyed: he searched for documents. What he found in the Curve GitHub was surprising. Curve, the second-largest decentralized finance (DeFi) project with over $7 billion in assets locked up, lacked a clear way to protect its intellectual property.      That’s an issue, the lawyer thought, especially in the fast-paced environment of DeFi where it’s become common for projects to launch under new names but with the same code as their competitors. In Curve’s case, there have been a number of copycats including the fork, Swerve, projects like Pickle and mStable that used some of the veCRV mechanisms and the venture capital-backed protocol, Saddle Finance.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    So, Sam Miorelli, the Sam behind the hydro moniker, did another very lawyerly thing: He wrote a proposal suggesting legal recourse.      “This is real and valuable [intellectual property]. If the DAO is serious about governance, they are going to have to handle a critical thing like IP, whether it's licensed agreements or open sourcing or whatever it might be. There are strategic decisions to be made there,” Miorelli told CoinDesk. “The way you do this in a DAO is you post a proposal and see what people think.”      Curve Improvement Proposal #xx (not a misprint) could be seen as a first in the world of decentralized governance. To use Miorelli’s words, it could “set an important precedent” for decentralized organizations to act a bit more like corporations and protect their property.      Viewed over 2,000 times, the proposal has opened up a lively debate inside and outside Curve’s governance structure. Some see it as antithetical to DeFi, which draws a direct line to the free and open software movement that views code as a public good – even for bad actors. Others see it as an advancement for DAOs and DeFi, a way to legitimize this emergent industry.      The Block first reported the story.      In his post, Miorelli wrote that Saddle Finance has often been accused of porting over Curve’s code. He takes a “natural rights” view of property law, and said that such an action is “doubly wasteful” in that it fails to contribute anything new to the world, wasting the time of the original creator and copier.      What’s worse is that Saddle is supported by at least nine venture funds – including major players like Polychain, Alameda Research, Framework, Boost and Dragonfly Capital – and claims copyright over its own code.      “VC’s investing in projects that infringe are scum and Curve should gleefully return their ill-gotten gains to veCRV holders,” he wrote. In conversation, Miorelli was less bombastic and highlighted he is only raising governance questions and not yet threatening legal action against any party.      “Personally, I think this is a knee-jerk reaction from Curve's community members who are less technical or less familiar with clean room implementation cases,” Saddle engineer John Lim said in a direct message. He added that Saddle is a re-implementation of the StableSwap algorithm in Solidity, not a “line-by-line” reproduction of the entire project.      DeFi has seen similar arguments before. Last summer, SushiSwap forked from the VC-backed Uniswap and added a governance token. Months later, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange that sometimes sees more volumes than Coinbase, launched its third version with a protective software license.      There are members of Curve’s community who see forks as additive. Avi Meyers, of data provider Flipside Crypto, wrote that Sushi didn’t end up bleeding Uniswap dry in its vampire attack but created “healthy” industry competition.      Others wrote that Curve’s “competitive moat” isn’t its code or “incomprehensible math,” as user anon-cat wrote, but the team behind the project, whom he trusts “to iterate rapidly to blow out any competition out of the water.”      For his part, Curve developer “Charlie” said that it’s good this conversation is happening, especially because the project “is seen as a fairly passive DAO.” However, he doesn’t know “if there's anything worth wasting our time on there.” He added that Saddle did port Curve’s code but that hasn’t necessarily hurt CRV token holders.    Read more: Lex Sokolin: DeFi Protocols Need to Act More Like Fiduciaries    Ultimately, it’ll be a community decision on how to proceed, Charlie said, adding that it's “sad” to see projects copy code and take funding, which Curve has rejected.      Matt Luongo, founder of Thesis and adviser to Saddle, thinks the post is without merit and lacks understanding of both the legal system and culture of DeFi. Dragonfly’s Haseeb Qureshi, a Saddle backer, declined to comment.      “I would say to people who are interested in this, please participate on the forum,” Miorelli said. “If more people engaged there we might be having a richer discussion and maybe coming to better answers.”",NEUTRAL,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | UNI,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/17/curve-dao-contemplates-its-intellectual-property,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed8ea8955f91ff3ff23e77f3eddd7a644e957078-2218x1180.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The run brought the worth of the protocol down from $2 billion to near zero on Wednesday.    A ""negative feedback loop"" was created when a series of large holders tried to redeem their IRON tokens and sell their iron titanium (TITAN), the token of the Iron Protocol, the post said. That, in turn, caused more TITAN holders to run for the virtual hills, leading to what the team labeled ""a classic bank run.""  ""What we just experienced is the worst thing that could happen to the protocol, a historical bank run in the modern high-tech crypto space,"" the post said.  The run was enabled by the fact that Iron Finance is only partly collateralized. It had enough for normal day-to-day operations, but just like in the bank run depicted in the movie ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" if everyone wants their money all at once, the bank can't pay up. Unfortunately for Iron Finance, there was no George Bailey around on Wednesday.  ""When people panic and run over to the bank to withdraw their money in a short period, the bank may and will collapse,"" the post said.  The so-called run garnered even more attention than it would have because of billionaire investor Mark Cuban's use of Iron Protocol. In the wake of the crash, Cuban is now calling on regulators to determine what constitutes a ""stablecoin.""  While declining to say how much he had lost, Cuban said that ""it was enough that I wasn't happy about it.""

The company plans to accept ether, shiba inu and chiliz alongside the first cryptocurrency as forms of payment at its 24 outlets, which include nightclubs, restaurants and pubs, directors Santiago Sosa and Rodrigo Nogues Bazan told CoinDesk.    Lee este artículo en español.    The announcement comes after Paraguayan congressman Carlos Rejala announced his plans to present a bill whose goal is to attract international bitcoin mining companies and other crypto businesses to Paraguay. Grupo Cinco’s announcement will boost the chances that the bill will pass Congress, Sosa said.      ""We are talking about leading Paraguayan entrepreneurs who have a lot of influence over the youth. This is extremely important because it will be much easier for my fellow deputies to support the bill if there is social support at a local level,"" Rejala said.      When accepting cryptocurrencies, GrupoCinco will provide vendors and customers with traditional invoices and receipts, Sosa said, adding that the company’s businesses have more than 50,000 customers per month.      GrupoCinco also owns G5Pro, a live entertainment business unit that sold 450,000 tickets to events in 2019, Nogues Bazan said. G5Pro won’t immediately accept cryptocurrencies for ticket sales, although it plans to do so soon.      GrupoCinco implemented the cryptocurrency payments with the help of entrepreneur Juanjo Benitez Rickmann, CEO of Bitcoin.com.py, a local mining company, Sosa said.      Payments will be processed through the Lightning Network and merchants will have the option of keeping those cryptocurrencies or exchanging them for fiat, Benitez Rickmann said.      To fit into the framework of Paraguay’s current legislation, GrupoCinco will treat cryptocurrencies as digital assets because Paraguay doesn’t have legislation for crypto assets yet, Benitez Rickmann added.      After the COVID-19 lockdown, Sosa and Nogues Bazan started adopting cryptocurrencies for personal use and then decided to bring them into the business, Sosa said.      Grupo Cinco's adoption could encourage young people in Paraguay to start using crypto because 80% of the company's customers are between ages of 18 and 25, Sosa said, adding that 60% of the country's population is under 30 years old.

42387132,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWkun,1623938508,TRM Labs Raises $14M as Crypto Tracking Steps Into Spotlight,"Ransomware heists have the New York Times committing headline crimes: “Pipeline Investigation Upends Idea That Bitcoin Is Untraceable.”      But as the power of blockchain analysis creeps out of the shadows, a handful of firms are cashing in.      TRM Labs, one such firm building crypto-tracking software, said Thursday it raised $14 million in an equity round led by Bessemer Ventures.      The Series A, which CEO Esteban Castaño said follows 600% revenue growth year over year, also features Jump Capital and Salesforce and PayPal’s respective VC wings. Castaño declined to disclose his five-year-old crypto startup’s current valuation but said the oversubscribed round closed in Q1.    TRM in growth mode    TRM Labs has been racing to scale its operation ever since: It has doubled its headcount – now at 30 – and doubled its revenue amid the crypto tracers moment in the spotlight, a moment largely driven by investigatory and institutional demand.      “The growth is from all sectors: financial institutions, cryptocurrency businesses and public sector government agencies, whether that's law enforcement regulators, or central banks,” he said.      Clients are hungry for software that can help them make sense of unwieldy blockchains, the tech back end of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Mainstream headline writers might not know it, but the world’s leading crypto is traceable by design.      That feature comes in handy for investigators.      FBI agents quickly tracked and seized much of Colonial Pipeline’s bitcoin ransom payment earlier this month by following the crypto trail. Past investigations have seen massive criminal rings busted with the help of tracing software.      Banks, too, are looking to utilize crypto’s inherent traceability. Every tale of institutional adoption starts with a back-office compliance officer vetting funds on chain, Castaño said.      “We're seeing a surge of demand from financial institutions, you know, banks that are looking to provide banking services to cryptocurrency businesses or to enable crypto as an asset class. And, you know, Blockchain intelligence is often the first item on their to-do list in order to move forward with those plans,” he said.

The article did not say how many people were surveyed.  The most popular currency, bitcoin, is owned by 9% of Australians though this has fallen from 13% at the start of 2021. Bitcoin's decline reflects the increasing popularity of ethereum (8%), dogecoin (5%) and bitcoin cash (4%).  Crypto adoption appears to be constrained by concerns over volatility. As many as 43% of Australians saw volatility as a deterrent to investing, a 14% increase since January, The Australian said.

Wedbush joins Credit Suisse, Instinet and Societe Generale in the Paxos program, which is built using a permissioned fork of Ethereum that allows two parties to bilaterally settle securities trades directly with each other.      Paxos recently tested same-day settlement of trades on the blockchain, a practice that looks all the more compelling in light of the share-trading fiasco involving the Wall Street Bets movement and trading platform Robinhood.      “It’s crystal clear that blockchain technology is destined to completely modernize securities settlement and custody,” Wedbush CEO Gary Wedbush said in a statement.    Paxos’ stock push    Paxos currently operates its blockchain-based settlement system under a “no-action” promise from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – basically when the regulator accepts a common-sense approach to something that is not technically legal.      Meanwhile, Paxos is applying to become a clearing agency with the SEC, which would make the cryptocurrency custodian one of just two clearing agencies in the U.S., joining the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).      “U.S. equities settlement is opaque and relies on outdated technology,” Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, said in a statement. “The Paxos Settlement Service reduces risk, enables greater trading liquidity and provides ownership transparency, which will revolutionize securities markets.”      Paxos closed a $300 million Series D in April that valued the firm at $2.4 billion.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/17/paxos-adds-wedbush-securities-in-quest-for-same-day-stock-settlement,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Glassnode data shows the bitcoin ""hodler net position change,"" which tracks net buying/selling activity of those holding coins for six months or more, has flipped positive for the first time since late October. Hodl is crypto slang for hold.      ""It shows HODLers are buyers here,"" Delphi Digital said in its daily market commentary dated June 16. ""The net positions of BTC HODLers is a strong indicator of how longer-term investors are thinking about BTC.""      Supply held by long-term holders has increased from 11 million to more than 11.6 million in the past few weeks, according to Glassnode.      While holders are now injecting bullish pressure into the market, that does not necessarily imply a sharp rally. Past data show bullish trends mostly pick up the pace after sustained accumulation by holders.      For example, the indicator remained positive for most of 2018, which was a negative year for bitcoin, and early 2019, when the cryptocurrency remained sidelined below $5,000. Bullish mood returned to the market in the second quarter of that year, pushing the cryptocurrency to $13,880 by the end of June.      Bitcoin scaled that peak in October 2020 – after a gap of 16 months. During that period the cryptocurrency was mainly in a bearish trend, falling from $13,000 to $4,000 between August 2019 and March 2020. Holders were net buyers throughout and during the subsequent recovery, and began distributing coins in November.      It remains to be seen if they will continue to be net buyers over the coming weeks and restore the battered market confidence.      Some chart analysts, though, are worried the cryptocurrency could see more selling in the short term because the daily plot shows the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) are set to produce a ""death cross"" (bearish crossover) in the next day or two.      According to Kraken's research, the previous instances of death crosses on the daily chart coincided with ""either a sell-off in the days that followed or a continued macro downtrend that confirmed a bear market.""      Macro funds, which bought bitcoin as a store of value, may sell if U.S. Treasury bond yields rise further. The U.S. two-year yield reached a 12-month high of 0.219% and the 10-year yield rose nearly 10 basis points to 1.59% on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled a future interest rate increase for earlier than some had anticipated.

42387127,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWksH,1623927674,Wattum to Build Kazakhstan Mining Farm in Conjunction With Enegix,"Wattum, a U.S.-based mining company, signed a deal for a farm in Kazakhstan run by Enegix.      The two announced Thursday they will build a mining facility with a capacity to provide 16 megawatts of energy for mining machines. They also committed to investing $2 million in the enterprise. Construction is expected to start in July.      Wattum and Enegix are also in talks to build a 50-megawatt farm, at a cost of $8 million.      The move might be signaling the industry is paying closer attention to the Asian nation, which has been actively developing its bitcoin mining market for the past several years. Miners have been actively seeking new venues since the Chinese government started cracking down on mining in some regions earlier this year. Kazakhstan has been one of the spots of interest, Enegix CEO and co-founder Yerbolsyn Sarsenov told CoinDesk.      Enegix works as a so-called mining hotel, meaning it provides space, energy and maintenance services for miners looking for locations for their machines. It already has a 180-megawatt capacity plant in the country. That is fully contracted and should be filled with clients’ ASICs until the end of this year.      “Last year, we had applications for 20 megawatts. This year, applications for hundreds of megawatts came in in a matter of weeks,” he said.      Some Chinese miners have already booked their spots in Kazakhstan: In May, BIT Mining committed to invest $9.33 million in building a 100-megawatt center with an unidentified local partner.      Wattum currently has farms in upstate New York and Pittsburgh. Kazakhstan is attractive because it's close to China, which makes it easier to deliver ASICs from manufacturers based there, CEO and founder Arseniy Grusha told CoinDesk    See also: Why China’s Crackdown May Make Bitcoin Mining More Centralized    Another plus: Kazakhstan allows miners to import equipment with zero tax, and mining itself is officially taxed in Kazakhstan, meaning it's a legitimate and government-approved business. Moreover, ""there is a lot of spare electricity in Kazakhstan,"" Grusha said. Most, however, is not ""green,"" he said, because of the heavy reliance on coal-based electricity.

42387135,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWkyZ,1623916800,Nornickel Launches Hyperledger-Based Tokens Backed by Nickel and Copper,"Nornickel, a major metal producer, wants investors to learn about digital assets.      To that end, when customers buy exchange-traded commodities (ETCs) based on the company’s metals, they will also receive blockchain-based tokens alongside the more traditional certificates.      Nornickel subsidiary Global Palladium Fund (GPF) is launching ETCs on nickel and copper, along with blockchain tokens proving their authenticity, on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Borsa Italiana, the firm announced Thursday.      The tokens will be issued by Swiss-based Atomyze, Nornickel’s tokenization platform, using Hyperledger Fabric, an open source blockchain base overseen by The Linux Foundation. Nornickel has demonstrated a long-lasting allegiance to Hyperledger. The company joined the consortium two years ago.      Wednesday's move is only the latest by Vladimir Potanin, Nornickel's oligarch founder, who has long been a champion of metal-backed cryptocurrencies.      The GPF has already launched gold, silver, platinum and palladium ETCs on LSE and the Deutsche Boerse. According to Alexander Stoyanov, managing director of the GPF, the securities were welcomed with notable demand, though he declined to disclose any numbers.    Blockchain story, with caveats    The Hyperledger-based tokens will have the numbers from particular metal batches purchased by a certain client encoded in them, while the traditional certificates will only show the client bought a share in the fund, according to Stoyanov.      The actual metal backing the ETCs will be stored in the vaults of the ICBC Standard Bank, institutional custody provider Brinks and London Metal Exchange warehouses in Rotterdam. Buyers will receive the traditional certificate representing their share in the GPF, along with tokens on their accounts with Atomyze.      Now, those two will not be directly connected, Stoyanov said, although he hopes that in the future, when the market is more used to tokenized commodities, that will change.      Read more: Meet the Russian Oligarch Launching a Metal-Backed Crypto Token      “Of course, we would love to sell our tokens without the ETCs. But the [investment] funds have a mandate from their clients to buy certain investment products. And we want to create a community and get people comfortable with the DLT and such products. With time, acceptance of this format will come,” Stoyanov told CoinDesk over a call.      The tokens were created to show buyers the benefits of decentralization and transparency that blockchains provide. In reality, however, the project looks more like a traditional, centralized enterprise. At this point, the only way to check your token balance is to look it up in your Atomyze account. There are no external blockchain explorers that can be used to verify that information, Stoyanov said.      It is also technically impossible to withdraw your tokens from Atomyze, according to Stoyanov. The blockchain nodes will be run by Atomyze itself. He said the stock exchanges listing the ETCs would not run their nodes, at least for now.      “We don’t even know how to start a conversation about this with the exchanges,” Stoyanov admitted. “However, I know some of them are looking that way already. With our project, we’ll try to prop the look a bit more actively.”    Tokenization dreams    Nornickel is one of the few industrial heavyweights that wants to use distributed ledger technology (DLT) not only for enterprise use cases, like trade finance or supply chain management, but also for tokenizing its own assets.      Potanin, the company's founder, has been a long-time fan of blockchain technology. His vision is to let people buy metal-backed tokens as a way to get exposure to metal-related markets without having to bet on particular companies’ success.      Since starting its blockchain venture in 2019, Nornickel had two issuers registered in Switzerland and the U.S., the latter hiring a group of execs from top enterprise blockchain, crypto and Wall Street firms.

42387152,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWknF,1623914966,Iron Finance's Titan Token Falls to Near Zero in DeFi Panic Selling,"Iron Titanium token (TITAN) – the share token of a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that was once worth $2 billion – has fallen to near zero.      The token was recently changing hands for around $0.000000035, down from Wednesday's high of $65. The fallout, which has been swift, has brought the project to its knees.      Some argue the interest from billionaire investor Mark Cuban has only exacerbated the situation as people discovered his DeFi wallet and alleged that he is the sole provider of TITAN/Dai on the Polygon blockchain.      TITAN belongs to Iron Finance, a project that began bridging to Polygon’s chain on May 18 in a bid to tap into Polygon's efficiency and low transaction fees.      The project was attempting to boot a partially collateralized stablecoin known as IRON. The stablecoin, in turn, consists of Circle and Coinbase's stablecoin, USDC, as well as TITAN, and was pegged to $1. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is attached to financial assets such as commodities or government-issued currency in a bid to keep them stable.      In the case of IRON, which receives its collateral backing from TITAN, users may mint new stablecoins through a mechanism on Iron Finance's network by locking up 25% in TITAN and 75% in USDC.    See also: DeFi ‘Raises Challenges’ for Investors, Regulators, SEC’s Gensler Says    Due to how the ""tokenomics"" of this particular DeFi project functions, when new IRON stablecoins are minted, the demand for TITAN increases, driving up its price. Conversely, when the price of TITAN falls dramatically, as was the case on Wednesday evening, the peg becomes unstable.      ""TITAN's price went to $65 and then pulled back to $60. This caused whales [large investors] to start selling,"" Fred Schebesta, founder of Finder.com.au and an Iron Finance investor, told CoinDesk via Telegram. ""That then led to a big de-pegging of [IRON].""      As the big investors began to offload their TITAN tokens, they flooded the market with excess tokens, causing a bank run. A bank run refers to a situation when a large percentage of users attempt to withdraw their money at the same time believing the bank, or in this case, the protocol, will cease to exist.    Read more: Belt Finance to Compensate Users Following $6.23M Attack    In turn, as TITAN began to fall in dramatic fashion, so did the pegged value of IRON. As the selling by large holders further decreased the value of IRON, it triggered the stablecoin’s mechanism that mints TITAN and removes liquidity in a bid to stabilize IRON to $1.      That caused an arbitrage opportunity in the difference in price of IRON and TITAN, which in turn flooded the market with even more TITAN tokens, adding additional selling pressure and destabilizing IRON’s price even further.      “It was a crypto vortex of money,” Schebesta said.      In the beginning, users were receiving a return of an incredible 2%-5% per day. When the dust settled, TITAN was near zero and IRON was last seen trading way off peg, at around $0.69.      The project has responded by offering redemptions in USDC but reminded users they will need to wait 12 hours for a timelock feature to pass before it can be executed.      At one stage, Iron Finance had over $2 billion in total value locked on Polygon. That value has since dropped to around $356.5 million, according to the protocol's own dashboard.

42387133,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWkxJ,1623913200,Blockchain Privacy Firm Integritee Raises $2M Ahead of Kusama Parachain Auction,"Integritee, a provider of confidential computing tailored to the blockchain space that is vying for a parachain slot in the forthcoming Kusama network auctions, has raised $2 million seed funding.      The fundraising was led by investment firm LD Capital, and included AU21, DFG, FBG and OKEx Blockdream Ventures.      Bidding for parachain slots within the Polkadot ecosystem is just getting underway, with the first auctions starting this week for Kusama, a more experimental and easier-to-upgrade network than Polkadot, the more enterprise-focused big brother.      Switzerland-based Integritee’s $2 million seed round is to fund further development of the platform, co-founder Alain Brenzikofer said, rather than used for locking up tokens on Kusama as part of a crowdloan strategy (a means for token holders to lend their DOT or KSM as collateral for the parachain lease in return for rewards).      Read more: Lending Startup Parallel Finance Raises $2M to Bring More DeFi to Polkadot, Kusama      “We will not be trying to win one of the first very few slots,” Brenzikofer said in an interview. “We are planning to do a decentralized crowdloan and will soon publish our tokenomics and incentives. Bottom line is we will participate in both the Kusama and Polkadot slot auctions with a crowdloan, and we’re pretty confident to get in later on.”      Integritee combines blockchain with hardware-based trusted execution (TE) environments, in this case Intel SGX, to solve for confidentiality of data and scalability.      TE on Polkadot brings a transparent layer of public auditability to the process of remote attestation, a way of checking that some machine is running Intel SGX. Intel does this only for legal entities that have a production license with them.      In terms of scaling an already capacious Polkadot ecosystem, the guarantees of SGX allow for TE-validated sidechains, rather than relying on complex encryption.      This allows for the decoupling of decentralized apps inside sidechains that are validated by TE, said Brenzikofer, meaning a much lighter consensus protocol since validators are already trusted and there’s less networking overhead.      “We believe that TEs as commodity hardware are a fast way to a large market for decentralized, confidential computing,” Brenzikofer said. “So, confidentiality in a much more production-ready way than using lots of cryptography that’s still very academic and doesn’t generalize well.

42387121,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWkfh,1623911600,Goldman Sachs Starts Coverage of Silvergate Capital With Neutral Rating,"In an analysts’ note, Goldman Sachs began its coverage of Silvergate Capital with a neutral rating, expressing optimism about Silvergate's growth prospects but concerns about regulatory uncertainty and surging competition from traditional banks.      The investment bank, which has warmed to the crypto industry over the past year, highlighted Silvergate’s strong network of customers and growth opportunities, stemming from an increasing flow of fiat deposits. Silvergate Capital is the bank holding company for Silvergate Bank, which provides products and services for cryptocurrency investors.      Silvergate ended the first quarter with $6.8 billion in crypto-related deposits, and Goldman Sachs said it believes “organic client growth” could boost that amount to $20 billion.      The analysts also said that Silvergate could generate up to 50% higher net income on those deposits by moving even just a portion of them into an investment portfolio. They also said they see a market of $80 billion for collateralized crypto-backed loans.      Goldman Sachs views Silvergate as “an acquisition candidate,” but mentioned in the note an unsettled regulatory environment and a growing interest in the crypto industry among established financial services firms. “We view the large banks as the most significant threat to Silvergate’s business,” the analysts’ note said.      Separately, Silvergate announced Tuesday that Michael Lempres will become chairman and Aanchal Gupta will join the boards of directors for the company and Silvergate Bank. Lempres has been a member of Silvergate's board since 2019. Among his earlier positions, he was executive in residence at venture firm Andreessen Horowitz and chief legal and risk officer at Coinbase.      Gupta has served in several high-level technology security roles. As vice president of Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform, she now oversees cloud security products.

42387129,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWkr1,1623890421,World Bank Denies El Salvador's Request for Technical Assistance on Bitcoin,"The World Bank has rejected a request from El Salvador to assist the country in implementing bitcoin as a legal tender.      According to a report by Reuters on Wednesday, the bank, which is an international financial institution offering grants and loans to low-income countries, said it was ""committed to helping El Salvador"" for currency transparency and regulatory process.      “While the government did approach us for assistance on bitcoin, this is not something the World Bank can support given the environmental and transparency shortcomings,” a World Bank spokesperson said via email. The use of cryptocurrencies has raised environmental concerns because of the amount of electricity it takes to mine bitcoin.      On Wednesday, Salvadoran Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya said his country had approached the bank for technical assistance in order to implement bitcoin alongside the U.S. dollar, according to the Reuters report.      El Salvador officially recognized the crypto as legal tender earlier this month when President Nayib Bukele proposed a bill that was eventually passed via supermajority in the country's legislature.

42387131,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWkw3,1623889844,"Polychain, Pantera Back $14M Funding Round for DeFi Derivatives Platform SynFutures","Decentralized finance (DeFi) derivatives exchange SynFutures raised $14 million in a Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital, SynFutures announced Wednesday.      As DeFi continues to gain in popularity, investors look to capture niche markets within the industry. SynFutures said it will focus its entire platform on derivatives, which are financial instruments like futures contracts or options. The funding comes fresh on the heels of a $65 million capital raise for fellow DeFi derivatives exchange dYdX.      Singapore-based SynFutures said it wants to eliminate barriers to entry to the derivatives market for smaller investors for different products, including large cryptocurrencies, altcoins, equities, metals and indexes.      Other investors included Framework Ventures, Pantera Capital, Bybit, Wintermute, CMS Holdings, Kronos and IOSG Ventures.      “We’re aiming to level the playing field for the average investor by cultivating a free and open market for derivatives trading,” SynFutures CEO Rachel Lin said in a press release.

SynFutures will support a variety of assets, including ERC-20 tokens and cross-chain assets. To avoid price volatility, SynFutures uses a rigid modeling and risk management system to protect users' positions, Lin said. The company hopes to use best practices from traditional finance to add stability to the DeFi sector.      SynFutures is now being used by a limited set of users in a testing phase known as ""closed alpha."" But the company plans to open the platform to all users next month as a result of the new funding. It also plans to release new products aimed at improving user experience, which include a hash rate derivative and the capabilities for cross margining.      “We look forward to supporting such a strong founding team with extensive experience spanning both traditional finance and blockchain technology, a rarity in the industry, as they bring synthetic derivatives to new users across the globe,” Polychain Capital CEO Olaf Carlson-Wee said in a press release.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/17/polychain-pantera-back-14m-funding-round-for-defi-derivatives-platform-synfutures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c1c17604fa11228c27832f43d6ef89049e52872-1920x1277.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
