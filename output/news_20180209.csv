42428539,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8lzh,1518216906,SEC Denies FOIA Request on Controversial Tezos ICO,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has denied a request for information regarding the Tezos blockchain project, citing an exemption typically applied to records gathered for law enforcement activities.  The denial letter was addressed to attorney David Silver of the SilverMiller law firm and dated Feb. 6, in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request he submitted at the start of the month. Silver is representing plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in November, one of several such cases filed in the wake of Tezos' $232 million ICO from last year.  According to a copy of the letter obtained by CoinDesk, the U.S. securities regulator withheld ""information concerning Tezos"" citing Exemption 7(A), which allows for exemptions in the case of enforcement activities.  The letter does not state that Tezos is under investigation by the SEC.  The SEC wrote:  ""This exemption protects from disclosure records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement activities. Since Exemption 7(A) protects the records from disclosure, we have not determined if other exemptions apply. Therefore, we reserve the right to assert other exemptions when Exemption 7(A) no longer applies.""  In Silver's interpretation, the letter proves that the SEC is actively investigating the blockchain project, which has been roiled by a governance crisis in recent months.  ""Consistent with what [SEC chair] Jay Clayton said at the Senate hearing this week, I'm happy to learn that the SEC is investigating Tezos, as many clients are going to eventually learn that their investments are worthless,"" he told CoinDesk. Silver has also filed lawsuits on behalf of customers of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Cryptsy and bitcoin miner Giga Watt.  However, the letter goes on to say that as a matter of policy, the SEC ""does not disclose the existence or non-existence of an investigation or information gathered unless made a matter of public record in proceedings brought before the Commission or in the courts.""  A representative for Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, the founders of Tezos, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

So says Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of graphics card maker Nvidia, which yesterday posted its fourth-quarter results for 2017.

Speaking with Barron's in an interview, Huang echoed that sentiment, remarking that ""clearly, there's a lot of talk about crypto."" Indeed, much has been said about demand for the firm's products (gripes from the gaming community about sky-high prices for GPUs notwithstanding) and the long-term prospects Nvidia faces.  ""And crypto was a real part of our business this past quarter, even though small, overall,"" the Nvidia CEO said.  Huang touted also touted the benefits of the technology underlying cryptocurrencies. There is ""clearly real utility"" with blockchain, Huang said, adding that he sees cryptocurrencies as being as real as any other type of virtual good or video game.  He expanded on this idea, going on to say:  ""And as you know, tens of millions of virtual goods are created and shared and sold in virtual reality, and people invest thousands of hours to create space ships in space that they battle against each other. So, the concept of virtual goods and virtual worlds and virtual currency all ties together.""  Bigger picture aside, the conversation around sales to miners is not that important for Nvidia, Huang argued, noting that ""to us, it's all just demand for GPUs.""  Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, had also downplayed the impact cryptocurrency mining during the quarterly earnings call on Thursday, saying it was hard to quantify just how much revenue the company made from sales to cryptocurrency miners.

42428546,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8m9h,1518199544,Ethereum Devs Call for Public Debate on Fund Recovery,"Ethereum's more senior developers are calling for a public debate over what steps, if any, should be taken at the software level to return funds lost in high-profile hacks and incidents.  In a bi-weekly meeting Friday, the developers took sides over a controversial ethereum improvement proposal, EIP 867, which advocates for a method of returning funds to potential victims. As profiled by CoinDesk, the issue has emerged as a lightning rod due to the fact the proposal advocates using system-wide software upgrades as a possible fix.  It perhaps wasn't a surprise then that the meeting showcased the passions on either side of what is becoming one of the platform's more prominent arguments.  Still, others sought a more middle-ground solution, such as having a more public debate.  Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir told attendees:  ""These proposals, especially proposals that do set important precedents, that impact the relation of the community and the platform, I think need to be subject to a public debate that I'm not actually sure the EIP process is designed to handle.""  In response, community manager Hudson Jameson agreed, stating his belief the debate should play out on social media. Likewise, independent developer Alexey Akhunov proposed a live video debate between developers.  Some struck a reserved tone to the idea, though.  Developer Piper Merriam warned that a live discussion was liable to become a ""politician-based thing,"" stating that the debate should remain in written form. ""Otherwise it's a popularity contest,"" he said.  As such, the comments hint at another component of the debate, one that has tackled the issue just what role developers should play in blocking proposals from public discussion.  EIP 867, for instance, is led by lesser-known developer Dan Phifer from Musiconomi, a startup that lost a substantial amount of ether in the Parity fund freeze last year.  EIP editor Yoichi Hirai originally rejected the proposal due to its failure to comply with what he described as ""ethereum philosophy,"" however he is now adopting a more liberal approach to his role, stating that ""the EIP repository is like Twitter.""  ""Everyone can say whatever they want and I merge everything,"" he said.  For now, no further action will likely be taken on the proposal until ethereum's process for accepting code changes, detailed in EIP-1, has been clarified.  However, Jameson said today that the current controversy had accelerated such efforts.

Bitstradehttp://www.bitstrade.org/AboutUs.aspx  boasts on its website that it is ""a registered United States company providing Private Banking service to the masses,"" though the address listed at the top is the same as Blue Razor, a domain registration company based in Scottsdale, Arizona. A message sent through Bitstrade's online message system was not immediately returned at press time.  According to the release, Bitstrade is not currently registered to offer securities in the state.  Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in a statement:  ""The Bureau’s action today reinforces our commitment to protecting investors as they navigate the uncharted and largely unregulated domain of cryptocurrency-related investments. We want to make sure that investors tempted to cash in on the cryptocurrency rage aren't being lured into sending funds to an anonymous internet entity without knowing where the funds are going or how they'll be used.""

As previously reported by CoinDesk, last month a group of lawmakers submitted a bill that, if passed, would enable taxpayers to use bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in order to pay ""tax and any interest and penalties"" to the state's Department of Revenue. The Department, in turn, would have 24 hours to convert those payments to U.S. dollars.  Public records  show that the Senate passed the bill on Feb. 8 by a 16-13 margin, with one no-vote. The measure has since been sent to the state's House of Representatives for further consideration.  While the measure's success is contingent on both approval in that chamber, as well as any possible reconciliation required if the House and Senate ultimately pass different versions, the successful vote bodes well for its final passage. Late last month, lawmakers on the Senate's Finance Committee cleared the bill by a 4-3 vote.  Arizona State Rep. Jeff Weninger, one of the co-sponsors of the bill and a sponsor himself of several related bills – including one submitted this week that, if approved, would block local and county regulation of blockchain nodes – recently told Fox News that the tax measure is aimed at making the state an accommodating place for users of the technology.

Let's look at the numbers of the most notable on both sides for this week:  Best performers  Lisk  Weekly Performance: 20.92 percent  All-time high: $39.31  Closing price on Jan. 2: $21.41  Current market price: $25.89  Rank as per market capitalization: 14  As the broader market recovered, lisk's native currency LSK witnessed a solid rally from $11.97 (Feb. 6 low). The token has moved above its 50-day moving average (MA) and is very close to breaking above the current monthly high of $20.65. Currently, its market capitalization is $3 billion.  Lisk's upcoming relaunch on Feb. 20 seems to be garnering plenty of attention from the investor community.  ""On Feb. 20, the company will unveil an entirely updated and improved Lisk platform, new brand identity and website,"" according to company's blog.  Bitcoin gold  Weekly Performance: 12.98 percent  All-time high: $484.78  Closing price on Jan. 2: $110.23  Current market price: $124.54  Rank as per market capitalization: 19  Bitcoin's offshoot, bitcoin gold (BTG), is up 66 percent compared to its weekly low of $72.12. Despite the strong performance, the cryptocurrency is reporting a 70 percent decline on a three-month basis. Further, it is down 74 percent from its all-time high.  Litecoin  Weekly Performance: 12.82 percent  All-time high: $375.29  Closing price on Jan. 2: $131.38  Current market price: $148.23  Rank as per market capitalization: 6  Litecoin (LTC) is up more than 35 percent from the weekly low of $106.94.  The last week has turned out to be pretty eventful for LTC. The cryptocurrency ran into bids on Sunday amid false reports that LTC was to undergo a hard fork. However, the rumor was soon dismissed by Litecoin founder Charlie Lee as a possible scam attempt.  Later, Lee tweeted about the launch of LitePal – a new litecoin-based payment processor – that seems to have the investor community a little excited.  Worst Performers  Populous  Weekly Performance: -35.40 percent  All-time high: $75.67  Closing price on Jan. 2: $53.35  Current market price: $35.46  Rank as per market capitalization: 24  Populous is a smart contract-based invoice discounting platform on the ethereum blockchain, according to the official website. Its PPT token hit a low of $23.52 on Feb. 6, but the ensuing recovery has been shallow. Comments on social media indicate investors are worried about the delay.  Nano    Weekly Performance: -31.31 percent  All-time high: $34.43  Closing price on Jan. 2: $16.51  Current market price: $11.34  Rank as per market capitalization: 22  Nano, formerly called RaiBlocks, was listed on the cryptocurrency trading platform Binance last Friday. However, that failed to keep the cryptocurrency bid. Prices hit a low of $6.54 on Jan. 6.  ICON  Weekly Performance: -18.86 percent  All-time high: $12.04  Closing price on Jan. 2: $5.3  Current market price: $4.3  Rank as per market capitalization: 21  The goal of the ICON project is to provide an intermediary blockchain which acts as an open source ecosystem to allow different communities, institutions, and block chains to interact while maintaining their autonomy, according to reddit page. The project is powered by ICX cryptocurrency, which fell to a low of $3.77 on Jan. 6.

42428553,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8mNh,1518181217,Why Crypto Needs to Start Taking SpankChain Seriously,"On New Year's Day, Giselle Palmer, scantily clad, turned on her webcam, and started her sexy show.  Offhandedly she told her hundreds of viewers that she had studied computer science and math in college, and from that moment on the chat room was filled with questions about non-sexy topics from computer science to calculus. If that seems strange for a group watching a camgirl seductively striptease — it normally would be, but Palmer was posing in front of a group of crypto enthusiasts.  ""I don't think Giselle was prepared for how nerdy our community is in crypto,"" said Ameen Soleimani, CEO and co-founder of SpankChain, a blockchain-based startup focused on the adult entertainment industry, which sponsored the show as a technical stress test.  As the mathematical comments continued, eventually Palmer teased the audience, asking what they wanted to get out of the cam session – boobs or math?  ""There was just a wall of people being like 'Math! Math! Math!' in the chatroom,"" Soleimani said.  He called it a hilarious experience, one that aligns with how most people (that only hear about the idea at a high level) view the project: hilarious in that it mashes together something geeky with something explicit.  But that'd be callow way of looking at the project.  While there's been a handful of adult entertainment-based ICOs proposed, SpankChain is the one that gets mentioned privately fairly regularly, primarily because the project's underlying technology – running micropayments through payment channels – is solid.  Yet, SpankChain remains on the fringes of the public conversation surrounding ICOs.  Soleimani told CoinDesk:  ""Even though we crush it in word of mouth, people aren't willing to publicly take a position on our business, because they fear it will have an impact on their reputation, even though they will shill shitcoins to the ends of the earth.""  And true enough, none of the investors CoinDesk spoke to would go on-the-record about their interest in SpankChain.  This is obviously frustrating for the SpankChain team, especially with the silence coming from a community that touts itself as financial rebels and digital anarchists. Nevertheless, the company was able to raise 19,840 ETH (worth $6 million at the time) selling roughly 30 percent of the one billion total ""spankcoin"" pool in an ICO that ended in mid-November.  And the company is using that money to continue developing its payment system and the livestreaming site it will use to show that system off, whether the world is ready or not.  Give me that booty  ""Saving it in the spankbank"" wasn't a double entendre before Spankchain.  But to the company, SpankBank is just one part of a technology stack that makes cheap, quick and easy micropayments to performers possible.  It starts, though, with the company's spankwallet (formerly called ""vynos""), an in-browser wallet that connects to an ethereum payment channel. This wallet allows users to load ether into a payment channel with SpankChain and use that value to tip performers.  Ethereum's fee mechanism, gas, is only charged when users open a new payment channel or exit a payment channel, otherwise users can make as many transactions as they want (or can with the amount of value they put into the channel) without a fee from there.  In building this, SpankChain seems ahead of ethereum developers more broadly (like those behind Raiden or FunFair) who have been working on building useful payment channel technology for the blockchain for some time.  The spankcoin token then is used for staking to the SpankBank, and it then regularly emits another token called ""booty.""  Booty can also be used to tip performers, which helps because it's the only token that can be used to pay the service fees accrued by using the SpankChain cam site.  SpankChain's service fees, for hosting the site and doing administrative work, such as verifying all performers are of age, are slated to be 5 percent of the performer's revenue, which compared to the up to 50 percent mainstream porn sites charge, is likely very attractive to talent.  Performers can also stake their own spankcoin to receive booty or exchange ether for booty to pay their fees.  More information about the economics under SpankChain can be found in the white paperhttps://spankchain.com/static/whitepaper.bbff96f5.pdf, but Soleimani is proud to have built such a complex system while others around the team, including ethereum developers themselves, struggle to go live with payment channels. though it basically works now, user experience has been a key concern.  ""A lot of work has gone into just designing it,"" he said, adding:  ""This project is led by a team of technologists who have been thinking about and figuring out scaling over the last year and a half.""  Micropayments eruption  But as other crypto-based micropayments efforts have displayed, getting people to make small value payments frequently is easier said than done.  ""Micropayments is a thing that is deemed kind of impossible,"" Sergey Ukustov of Machinomy, the Russian payment channels startup that SpankChain partnered with to build its platform, told CoinDesk. ""There is too much psychological burden.""  In other words, a person is always going to ask themselves if any form of media is worth whatever amount of money a site has asked them to pay for it. And that burden generally prevents them from ever spending anything.  Yet, Ukustov believes content of a sexual nature is more highly valued by consumers and will, in turn, push consumers into going ahead and making the payment.  ""That makes porn related use case the most ideal use of micropayments you could ever get,"" he said.  As such, Soleimani sees the platform and its token being broadened out to other adult content sites using what he calls a spankcard. As long as the sites are integrated with SpankChain, users will one day be able to use the same payment mechanisms to tip and spend from site to site.  That's a longer term initiative. First and foremost, even before the entire SpankChain system goes live, Soleimani is focused on showing adult entertainment stars that they can earn better money by adopting crypto.  A spunky stunt  To this end, SpankChain has developed a preview game called CryptoTitties, a pun of the insanely popular cat breeding ethereum application CryptoKitties.  The concept is simple: performers will post an image of their decolletage on the site with an ethereum address and fans will tip the ta-tas. The image that gets the most tips will win.  ""The tips will go straight to their browser wallet,"" Soleimani said.  Soleimani and his team spent their time at the Adult Video News Awards in Las Vegas in January taking topless photos of adult entertainment stars and setting them up with ethereum wallets, so the site will have plenty of photos to choose from right away.  ""We just want them to experience receiving money and not having them go through anybody,"" Soleimani explained. ""For them it's going to be incredibly powerful to receive payments straight to their wallet.""  While he, and the rest of the community, wonder whether CryptoTitties can get as much traction as CryptoKitties did, Soleimani said really the project is about community building and recruiting performers.  Because above all else, Soleimani wants to see SpankChain live in the next couple months.  And he's willing the trade some decentralization for that. He pointed to the company's use of a centralized video streaming solution, and the fact that users will have to trust SpankChain in some regards since there will initially only be one payment channel to pay into. SpankChain will then send the correct amount of crypto to each performer directly.  ""A lot of these decentralized protocols are going to take some time to get going. I am willing to make every single tradeoff for centralization just to get this thing out faster,"" he said, adding:  ""I want it out in two months not three years.""

During an event on Tuesday this week, Sushil Chandra, chairman of India's Central Board of Direct Tax (CBDT) confirmed that around 100,000 notices have been sent to residents who have not included their cryptocurrency investment on income tax returns.  According to Chandra, the notices were sent by the department's law enforcement units across the country to ensure cryptocurrency investors are aware of their tax liabilities.  Chandra said:  ""People who have made investments [in cryptocurrencies] and have not declared income while filing taxes and have not paid tax on the profit earned by investing, we are sending them notices as we feel that it is all taxable.""  The latest statement from India's tax department comes as confirmation to a previous report saying that tax notices were sent to investors after a nationwide survey has discovered some $3.5 billion-worth of cryptocurrency being traded in a 17-month period.  According to Chandra, his agency has conducted several surveys on domestic exchanges in an effort to gather information about regular traders, including ""how many people are regular contributors, how many have registered themselves and how many have done trading.""

In an announcement on its homepage, Bithumb said that, starting from Feb.9, investors on the platform will be able to confirm their real identity through accounts at Nonghyup Bank. The firm further detailed that KYC integration with Shinhan Bank is also being pursued.  The integration arrives just 10 days after a formal ban on anonymous virtual trading accounts in South Korea. As reported by CoinDesk, the country's Financial Services Commission (FSC) had mandated that all cryptocurrency exchanges in the country must introduce real-name verification procedures for all customers via domestic banks by Jan. 30.  That followed the ruling that domestic banks must stop issuing new virtual accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges, announced in late December.  The KYC integration means existing and new investors registered on Bithumb are able to resume trading in compliance with the commission's rules.  Yet it appears that not every platform is finding it easy to transition to the new KYC procedures. A smaller exchange, Coinpia, had to halt trading and deposits after it failed to integrate the verification system with local banks.

42428560,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8mXh,1518170404,Bitcoin Price Looks North as Stock Market Falls Again,"BTC looks set to make further gains amid mixed action in the crypto markets.  Having hit a four-day high of $8,621.27 yesterday, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) fell to $7,754.67 at 05:29 UTC today. As of writing, prices had bounced back to $8,284. The cryptocurrency has depreciated by 0.4 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC) offshoot bitcoin cash has strengthened by 25 percent in the last 24 hours, while Ripple's XRP token is reporting a 3 percent rise. The losing side includes names like Ethereum's ether token, Cardano, Stellar and NEO, which are all showing slight dips.  Bitcoin's retreat from $8621.27 to $7,754 coincided with a 1000 point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), reportedly due to a rise in U.S. bond yields and fears of higher inflation.  Reports  are doing the rounds that the 90-day correlation between the daily percent returns of the cryptocurrency and the S&P 500 has jumped to 33 percent – the highest since January 2016.  Though this is up for debate, BTC's lackluster price action during the recent bout of equity market sell-off may discredit the theory often put forward that the cryptocurrency is a new safe haven asset like gold, the Swiss franc and treasuries.  So, for the time being, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are unlikely to receive a shot in the arm due to instability in other markets.  Yet, bitcoin often confounds expectations, and the technical chart indicates scope for a rise to $9,000 over the weekend.  1-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  BTC has breached the rising trendline  Bull flag pattern – a bullish continuation pattern – meaning an upside break signal continuation of the rally from Feb. 6 low of $5,873.  4-hour chart  The previous two candles had big tails (big gap between lows and close), indicating strong dip demand, and have also established $7,750 as strong support. The candles also indicate that the descending trendline (1) is now acting as a strong support.  Meanwhile, on the higher side, BTC may face strong resistance above $8,625 considering the fact that bulls have faced rejection $8,650 and $8,625 in the last 24 hours.  View  Back-to-back 4-hour candles with long tails at key trendline support indicate BTC could witness an upside break of the bull flag pattern.  The bullish breakout would be confirmed after 1-hour candle closes above the flag resistance. In such a scenario, prices could reach $9,000–$9,185 (target as as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height added to breakout price).  On the downside, a break below $7,535 (Feb. 7 low) would signal breach of higher lows pattern and open the door for a drop to $7,000 levels.

42428558,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8mZh,1518166856,"$1,700? Even Bitcoin's Bear Case Is Bullish","Catherine D. Wood is the chief executive and chief investment officer at ARK Investment Management in New York.      As the first public asset manager to gain exposure to bitcoin at $250 through the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), ARK Invest faced a number of questions and much ridicule in September 2015.  Given our research-based conviction, and the knee-jerk reaction of skeptics, we knew we were on to something big.  Ending a near-cataclysmic slide from roughly $1,250 in November 2013 to $175 in January 2015, bitcoin’s price stabilized around its 200-week moving average for the next nine months, as shown by the green line below.  At that time, the European sovereign debt crisis was reverberating as Greece threatened to leave the European Union, providing bitcoin with a mid-summer bump.  Bitcoin's price action during those nine months suggested that its ecosystem was much more robust than professionals in traditional asset management were willing to acknowledge.  If nothing else, technicians were paying attention, so moving averages, resistance and support, and gaps were relevant.  Despite the recent plunge in bitcoin’s price from nearly $20,000 in December 2017 to less than $10,000 as of February 6, 2018, we remain convinced that bitcoin is the first of its kind in a new asset class, cryptoassets, and one that is here to stay.  During the past three years, cryptoassets have scaled past $500 billion in network value, with bitcoin now accounting for roughly a third of an ecosystem comprised of more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, cryptocommodities, and cryptotokens.  Born out of the convergence of technology, financial services, economics, and other social sciences, this new asset class presents a daunting challenge to professionals in each of those fields, not to mention the investing public.  Battle-tested  Bitcoin has overcome a number of battle tests during the last few years, as shown below by the fluctuations in its price. Following the graph is a list of the most important among those tests, representing ARK's ""aha moments.""  Now What?  If technicians and global macro traders are dominating trading activity now as they did in 2015, then the price of bitcoin could test a number of different technical levels ranging from $6,400 to $1,700 … and still be in a bull market.  I am not a technician but have learned their ways as they have influenced the behavior of stocks in our portfolios during major turning points in the market.  Among the levels of bitcoin's technical support, depicted on the graphs below and rounded to the nearest hundred, are the following:  $6,400: the 200-day moving average, a critical area of support according to traders.  $4,600: the last significant peak in September 2017.  $1,700: the 200-week moving average, the area in which bitcoin had bottomed when we started our journey in 2015, and a level last seen in May.  If bitcoin is leading the way to a new asset class, then we believe these price points are nothing more than psychological supports and will pale in comparison to its ultimate destination. We believe the price will bottom when buyers return and overcome or overwhelm sellers.  Adding to our confidence in the outlook for bitcoin are the numbers of developers and lines of code they are contributing to the community, not to mention the much anticipated and rapidly expanding Lightning Network.  As long as they are on board for the ride, so are we.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which owns Grayscale Investments, the sponsor of the Bitcoin Investment Trust.

The bill  , submitted on Feb. 6 to the Arizona House of Representatives, states that ""a city or town may not prohibit or otherwise restrict an individual from running a node on blockchain technology in a residence."" It includes another section which applies to any possible county-level regulations that could be crafted, with both elements stating that such rule-making would be a state issue rather than a local one.  It's not entirely clear whether the bill is aimed directly at cryptocurrency miners specifically or all nodes. Nodes are the key infrastructure layer for such networks, with each maintaining a copy of the blockchain's transaction history that can then be shared from node to node in a peer-to-peer fashion.  ""For the purposes of this section, 'running a node on blockchain technology' means providing computing power to validate or encrypt transactions in blockchain technology,"" the bill states.  The measure was put forward by Arizona State Representative Jeff Weninger (R-Chandler), the author of a 2017 bill enshrining the legality of blockchain signatures and smart contracts under state law. Weninger's bill attracted broad support within the state's legislature, and it was formally signed into law by Governor Doug Ducey on March 29 of last year.

42380322,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mx6F,1518152459,Maxwell Eyes Bitcoin Smart Contracts After Blockstream,"One of bitcoin's most respected developers, Gregory Maxwell, is returning to his cypherpunk roots with a series of new projects.  After nearly four years as CTO of high-profile bitcoin technology startup Blockstream, he's departed that position to focus exclusively on code. Mainly because, as Maxwell explained in his departure letter, he accomplished what he set out to do at the startup, addressing the ""significant under-investment"" in bitcoin's technology at the time he joined.  But with a ""much larger and more active"" developer community around bitcoin today, Maxwell is going into 2018 an untethered man set on improving bitcoin smart contracts.  In this pursuit, Maxwell published a paper on something called ""Taproot"" in mid-January, an idea that improves upon the privacy of MAST, an idea, long in the making, that could beef up bitcoin's smart contract abilities. Days later, Maxwell released another proposal called ""Graftroot,"" improving on MAST further.  So, why is this focus so attractive for Maxwell?  Maxwell told CoinDesk:  ""I expect every transaction to eventually use these tools, at least in limited ways. They are an incremental improvement, making things that were already more or less possible more private and efficient. They replace or make much better things like MAST.""  And so far, many developers have praised Maxwell's new work.  ""Taproot is annoyingly clever,"" Lightning Network creator Tadge Dryja quipped on Twitter, adding that while the idea sounds simple in hindsight, no one had thought about it before Maxwell.  Like a dandelion?  Maxwell's interest seems to be aligning with greater attention to MAST now that SegWit (a code change MAST depends on) has been activated on bitcoin.  To understand MAST, it's helpful to start by looking one of the common use cases of bitcoin today – M-and-N multi-signatures, which require that coins can only be spent if a certain number of users (such as two-of-two, three-of-five) approve the transaction. One problem that can arise in these types of transactions is that one party loses their private key to sign with or just decides altogether not to comply, and at that point the money is unspendable.  MAST allows users to add additional conditions for when a transaction can be spent in a more efficient way, helping to solve the above issue.  For example, a transaction can be set to lose the need for multiple signatures, if the multi-signature funds aren't spent after, say, 10 years. The magic of MAST is that it can cram all of this logic into one transaction efficiently.  In short, with Taproot and Graftroot, Maxwell has found a way to further improve privacy for these advanced transactions.  In Maxwell's eyes, the problem with MAST as it stands is that each MAST transaction looks different than a normal transaction, which can be harmful for privacy, since people viewing bitcoin's public ledger could theoretically glean which transactions are using MAST and in turn, more about financial transactions they have no business knowing anything about.  Taproot improves privacy in MAST instances where multi-signatures is used, by making those transactions, once settled on the blockchain, look the same as other transactions.  While Maxwell admits the use case is narrow, he told CoinDesk:  ""There has been a lot of hype about smart contracts, but real and meaningful useage of them hasn't caught up with that hype yet.""  But taking baby steps backed by real uses cases could help expand bitcoin's value proposition as programmable money.  Both proposals, according to Maxwell, make smart contracts ""easier to implement, more fee efficient and more private,"" he said. ""Taproot and Graftroot improve the backend technology for these advanced applications and by doing so will contribute to making them more accessible to people.""  And this ability to accomplish complex transactions without exposing that complexity is where Taproot specifically got its name.  ""Taproot is most efficient to use for smart contract usage that resembles the root system of plants like a dandelion – a thick central path and small alternatives,"" Maxwell said.  Simple but useful  While Maxwell is sold on the ideas, Taproot has attracted minor debate.  One of Maxwell's former co-workers at Blockstream, Mark Friendenbach, argued that Taproot shows that MAST, if implemented a certain way, could cause problems in the future. His contention isn't that Taproot itself is a bad proposal (in fact he argues the exact opposite), but that many of the MAST implementations on the table today aren't built with future iterations in mind.  While Chaincode developer Matt Corallo said Taproot's additional privacy is ""absolutely massive to the ecosystem"" and ""should not be handwaved away for vague possibly-advantages.""  As long as Taproot and Graftroot get approval from developers and the community, though, Maxwell said it is possible to roll out the technologies alongside ""future signature system upgrades,"" such as aggregate signatures, another project Maxwell has contributed to.  But there could be some barriers still. According to Maxwell, bitcoin smart contracts are still a long way off.  ""For real smart contracts like these to gain wide use a lot of additional work is required especially in the area of providing good user interfaces to use them,"" he said.  But still, if disagreements are overcome, implementing and rolling out MAST with Taproot and Graftroot will be relatively painless.  Maxwell concluded:  ""Taproot is one of these ideas which are very simple to implement but very useful.""

42380325,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MxBH,1518143729,Hong Kong Orders Exchanges to Delist Securities Tokens,"Hong Kong's securities regulator appears to be stepping up efforts to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges involved with initial coin offerings (ICOs).      In a statement released Friday, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) revealed it has sent warning letters to seven cryptocurrency exchanges advising that certain tokens being traded on their platforms may be defined as securities. Though the names of the exchanges were not disclosed, the SFC indicated they are either based in or connected to Hong Kong, and among the top 20 in volume globally.      According to the note, the move is part of a wider effort by the SFC to caution investors about the risks of trading cryptocurrencies, one that began more mildly with a warning on the possible risks of the ICO fundraising model on Sept. 5 of last year.      Notably, the SFC said that the inquiry may result in further action, but that so far the exchanges notified all responded to the inquiry.          ""Most of these cryptocurrency exchanges either confirmed that they did not provide trading services for such cryptocurrencies or took immediate rectification measures, including removing relevant cryptocurrencies from their platforms,"" the release reads.      The SFC has also written to seven unnamed ICO organizers that are soliciting investors from Hong Kong and whose tokens are considered as securities by the agency.      Stepping back, the move follows the SFC's partnership with the Hong Kong government, one that recently found the two agencies launching a public campaign to educate citizens on potential risk, fraud and hacking issues regarding cryptocurrency.      Going forward, the agency said it will not bear further violation or repeated offense to Hong Kong's securities laws.          ""We will continue to police the market and enforce when necessary,"" said Ashley Alder, the SFC's Chief Executive Officer. ""But we are also urging market professionals to do proper gatekeeping to prevent frauds or dubious fundraising and to assist us in ensuring compliance with the law.""

42380319,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mx4z,1518134455,Nvidia: Crypto Mining Sales Beat Q4 Expectations,"Nvidia's GPU products continued to see strong demand from cryptocurrency miners in Q4, the company's CFO said on an earnings call Thursday.  Issuing the remarks as the company unveiled its fourth-quarter earnings for 2017, Colette Kress said the company banked $2.91 billion in revenue during that period, an increase of more than 34% compared to the same time a year prior.  That said, Kress stressed that the demand the company has seen in months past could shift, depending on the fortunes of the cryptocurrency market.  Kress commented:  ""While the contribution of cryptocurrency mining to our business is hard to quantify, it is likely to have been higher than in previous years. However, we remain committed to our gaming demands as cryptocurrency trends are likely to remain volatile.""  Nvidia's leadership, including CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, have struck bullish notes on the boon of cryptocurrency mining for its bottom line. Elsewhere, the company has indicated that it anticipates mining to ultimately form a small part of its overall earnings picture.  The company did not plan for or expect increased profits from cryptocurrencies, an analyst later said on the call. In response to a question about how Nvidia modeled cryptocurrencies, he responded that they “modeled crypto approximately flat.”  ""There's a lot of dynamics going on in gaming,"" the analyst continued. ""One dynamic is there's a fairly sizable pent-up demand going into this quarter, but I think the larger dynamics that are happening relate to just the amazing games that are out right now.""
