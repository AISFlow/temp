42378559,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ibmd,1453403432,New Hampshire Legislators Kill Bitcoin Tax Bill,"A legislative effort that would have allowed New Hampshire residents to pay their tax bills using bitcoin has been defeated.  The New Hampshire House of Representatives voted 264 to 74 to kill the bill on 20th January – a move that came just over a year after the measure was first introduced.  The bill was introduced by state Representative Eric Schleien last January and proposed letting citizens in New Hampshire pay taxes and fees using the digital currency.  If passed, the New Hampshire State Treasurer would have been mandated to select a bitcoin payments firm to process the transactions and prepare a plan for how to accept bitcoin payments by January 2017.  Yet the bill faced opposition during initial debates. At the time, representatives raised questions about the exchange rate risks the state would experience due to fluctuating market prices of bitcoin.  Last fall, the subcommittee tasked with weighing the bill recommended that it be voted 'inexpedient to legislate' – legal jargon meaning the measure should be killed.  When reached for comment, Schleien told CoinDesk that future steps include working with those legislators that did vote for the measure and that he intended to submit a similar bill two years from now.  ​""Seventy-four votes for the bill. Good showing for a first time. More education and outreach needed. More activism needed,"" said Schleien.

42378553,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iZpr,1453393598,ECB Board Member: Blockchain Could Disrupt Payments,"Yves Mersch, member of the executive board of the European Central Bank (ECB), has said innovative new payments technologies like the blockchain have the potential to disrupt card-based payments.  Merschhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/html/cvmersch.en.html  made his comments while addressing a Bank of France Conference in Paris on 18th January, in a speech titled “Card payments in Europe – latest trends and challenges”.  Discussing the emergence of innovative payment solutions, including distributed ledger technologies, the banker predicted they could ""impact payment behaviour and the usage of cards and other traditional payment instruments in the years to come"".  Innovative card-based solutions have ""the potential to further boost card usage by replacing cash payments"" he said, while warning:  ""[T]he card industry will be challenged by strong competition from innovative payment solutions based on payment instruments other than cards.""  Reforming the card industry  Mersch cited instant payments as one of the challenges for card providers, explaining that the Euro Retail Payments Board, set up by the ECB, has decided that the European Payments Council should develop an instant payment scheme for euro payments based on the SEPA credit transfer system.  Elaborating on distributed ledger technologies, he predicted that they could potentially have a ""profound impact on the whole financial 'ecosystem'”, disrupting both the use of 'traditional' payment instruments and services and the payments processing industry.  More choice for consumers and businesses is beneficial, he said, provided new payment solutions offered are secure and efficient and that all providers ""play by the same rules"".  Still, card transactions still have ""huge"" growth potential in the EU, according to the ECB board member, so long as an instant payments system is realised and a ""harmonised, competitive and innovative European card payments area"" is achieved via ""standardisation, interoperability and appropriate security measures"".  He warned, though, that innovative payment solutions will pose a challenge to the cards industry. Competition will come from instant payments based on the SEPA credit transfer, from payment initiation services in the e-commerce sector, and from the adoption of distributed ledger technologies.  Mersch concluded:  ""This competition is welcome, provided the solutions offered in the market are secure and efficient and service providers play by the same rules. I am confident that the cards industry will find the right responses to these challenges – and to the benefit of users.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | WALLET,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/01/21/ecb-board-member-blockchain-could-disrupt-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d0854ad3f2de405ea7e735c97040ddf8bc0ac65-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378544,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iZkp,1453393565,Is Bitcoin For the Masses or Against the State?,"Bailey Reutzel is a veteran finance reporter, most recently covering the intersection of tech and finance for PaymentsSource.  Her latest project Moneytripping is a Gonzo-style journalism project focused on exploring money, politics and finance in America.  Should bitcoin be a more democratic online payment system accessible to everyone or a resistance tool for the lucky few who were in on the gold rush?  That may be the most pressing question facing the bitcoin network after developer Mike Hearn ""quit"" the open-source project in an open letter last week. Maybe these ideas aren’t exclusive, but the way the industry has banded together to discredit Hearn, one of its more active developers, seems to indicate that the bitcoin evangelists have lost the plot.  Hearn's arguments align with the idea bitcoin should aspire to be a faster, cheaper payment system to help consumers that have been exploited by banks and legacy payment providers for years. On the other side, he painted his antagonists as overly focused on keeping bitcoin ""decentralized' and ""censorship resistant"".  ""The idea that Bitcoin is inherently doomed because more users means less decentralisation is a pernicious one. It ignores the fact that despite all the hype, real usage is low, growing slowly and technology gets better over time,"" Hearn wrote in his much-covered criticism.  And Hearn's view is not without merit. Most of the bitcoin white paper focuses on the cost of initiating financial transactions online. Eliminating intermediaries or trusted third parties seems, on further reading, is only positioned as a way to reduce costs.  Satoshi Nakamoto writes in the bitcoin white paper:  “The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services.”  But what about the message encoded within the genesis block, the first block on the bitcoin blockchain? “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”  Many bitcoin enthusiasts will tell you this message gives credence to their assertions that bitcoin was created as a stateless currency, for anarchy, because of the bank’s misuse of power.  Satoshi's say  But was Satoshi aiming his barbs at the government or big banks?  Sure, both groups work closely, but the government is a public entity, whereas banks are for-profit. Both played a role in the financial crisis, but I'd argue governments were largely trying to stem the bleeding caused by the private sector.  While Satoshi has yet to come out and tell us exactly what that message means, it does seem he or she was taking a pessimistic political jab aimed at the banks. Depending on how you read that message, however, you could be convinced Satoshi was disparaging governments.  To lend credit to the former, Satoshi writes in the white paper:  ""These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.""  My emphasis added. Why would Satoshi give a pass to physical currency here if he created bitcoin as a currency to disrupt the state? That’s rhetorical.  Censorship resistance  It could be argued that the very idea of bitcoin as a censorship-resistant payment method came to prominence at least two years after the software was released.  WikiLeaks released thousands of classified documents in 2010 and sometime thereafter, supporters began sending bitcoin, since major payment providers had blocked transfers to the site. Around that time, the added advantage or disadvantage (depending on where you sit) of bitcoin as censorship resistant became the focal point.  Now, with all that in mind, Hearn, alongside several other Bitcoin Core developers, wrote a piece of code, branded Bitcoin XT that would raise the block size limit so that more transactions could be handled on the bitcoin network.  This would not only allow bitcoin to scale, as defined by adding new customers, but also means miners are doing more work for the same reward. You can start to see the adverse incentives for increasing the block size here.  When Hearn released Bitcoin XT, any mention of Bitcoin XT was censored from several forums and he and others who mentioned the code were banned from those forums. DDoS attacks, which Hearn (at least in Nathaniel Popper’s New York Times profile) claims were a hack for hire, soon followed for all nodes that supported Bitcoin XT.  One such attack was perpetrated on Coinbase, the largest Bitcoin exchange in the US, pushing them offline for a period of time.  But opponents of the code say that’s for the better, since Bitcoin XT could have centralized mining (more so than it already is) since handling bigger blocks would require more energy, meaning only those with considerable money to put behind CPU power could mine.  But this is already a problem, a side effect of proof-of-work.  Sorry Satoshi. Because proof-of-work is competitive, interested parties will either throw money at mining or band together in mining pools if that gives them an advantage.  Measuring up  One could even go so far as to claim the current banking system is more decentralized than bitcoin at this point. The Federal Reserve is composed of 12 banks across the country which then lend money to the nearly 7,000 banks in the country, not to mention the thousands of credit unions as well.  On the other hand, bitcoin (although still in its infancy) is currently managed primarily by four large mining pools, all out of China. While these pools are networks of many individual miners, there is uneasiness about this predisposition.  But maybe Hearn’s Bitcoin XT idea proposed changes to the young protocol that were too fast, too soon. Changes must happen slowly so the protocol doesn’t break, again, because there’s nearly $6bn tied up in it.  Remember how the bitcoin industry attacked the banks on their snail’s pace in adopting new technology?  Banks move slow for various reasons, but they're the same as the bitcoin industry's newfound baby steps. Banks work with a large and diverse customer base under regulatory and risk-based pressures in an effort not to lose their customer’s money.  But in bitcoin, this influx of money might eventually make bitcoin unreliable and nothing more than a rehash of the current financial system.  Because Bitcoin was hawked to the masses and very wealthy investors and stakeholders got involved, the experimentation stopped.  These stakeholders don’t want to lose their money. Of course not.  Although, the rallying cry every time the price of bitcoin dips and the media declares bitcoin dead, bitcoiners parade around with: ""The price of bitcoin has no bearing on its utility.""  It was an excuse, but also the truth, at one time. Bitcoiners, including myself, held bitcoin because we believed in its mission. Now people hold bitcoin to speculate. Theoretically, we should be OK losing money as long as it betters bitcoin’s utility.  But the ecosystem's stakeholders seem unwilling.  Miners want to mine more bitcoin and collect more fees for their efforts. Sure, they need to do so to stay in operation and keep securing the blockchain, but there must be measures to ensure they're not becoming entrenched interests with too much control.  Likewise, bitcoin firms like Coinbase or Circle should want to transact on chain. If they don't, what the fuck's the point? Off-chain transactions create an incentive for new middlemen on the blockchain, and middlemen are something the project sought to erase from the traditional financial system.  These companies have created nothing more than the P2P systems, like clearXchange or even Venmo, of financial institutions.  Breakdown in discourse  Bitcoin was interesting when it was an experiment, when it ran. It’s crawling now, crawling toward instability.  When someone brings up an issue with bitcoin, there isn’t civil, educated discourse, there’s death threats, ostracization and elaborate conspiracy theories.  Hearn nails it on the head here:  ""Bitcoin has gone from being a transparent and open community to one that is dominated by rampant censorship and attacks on bitcoiners by other bitcoiners.""  Yes, overall Hearn’s post was passive aggressive and sensational. Bitcoin isn’t dead and Hearn didn’t quit Bitcoin; he took at job with R3, a company developing blockchain infrastructure (public, hybrid and private) for the financial industry, which wouldn’t exist were it not for bitcoin.  But the fact remains, he brought up good points about a coup d'état, an overthrow by those with money and power.  Are we interested in having a discussion about the issues with bitcoin? Or should we keep pretending it’s infallible?  Are we interested in a discourse about the conflicts of interest now present? Or will I now be ostracized because I don't think censorship resistance is bitcoin's most interesting feature?

Speaking to Business Insider at the World Economic Forum in Davos, MasterCard CIO Garry Lyons outlined the steps the major global credit card network has so far taken to explore the industry.  Lyons said:  ""Like the rest of the world, we’re interested in seeing where blockchain technology goes.""  The comments come at a time when thought leaders in the traditional payments and finance industry are increasingly skeptical about the growing hype around ""blockchain"" and distributed ledger tech and its potential.  Lyons hinted at the growing chorus of blockchain enthusiasts, saying that every tech panel he attended at this week's Davos conference mentioned blockchain, with some even calling it ""the second coming"".  ""While we think it’s very interesting, we don’t want to, and no one wants to, be blindsided by rushing into it,” he told the news provider.  Lyons went on to speak positively about MasterCard's partnership with industry investment conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG), which the company said would help provide it with a strong connection to the industry.
