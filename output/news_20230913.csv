This is evidenced by the continuous rise in wallet activity that has been recorded during this time. Bitcoin Wallet Activity Hits Highest In 5 Months In a Tuesday post, on-chain data aggregator Santiment revealed that there has been a significant uptick in Bitcoin wallet activity despite the BTC price downtrend. Apparently, while the market had fluctuated heavily due to regulatory uncertainties, Bitcoin investors held their own, especially in terms of new wallet address activity. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Flee Ethereum Amid Plunge Toward $1,500 The Santiment reports show fluctuations in this metric over the months. However, the one consistent thing was the tendency to jump back up even after dipping significantly. In September alone, the metric has moved from a low of around 860,000 to over 1.1 million unique daily Bitcoin addresses active. Unique daily addresses hit 5-month high | Source: Santiment on X Interestingly, this figure is the highest this metric has been since April, proving that the BTC price downtrend has not served as a deterrent for Bitcoin investors. Rather, it looks as if investors are using the current low prices as a way to increase their footprint. The uptick can also be explained by the euphoria triggered by asset manager Franklin Templeton filing for a Spot Bitcoin ETF. While the hype around the filing was short-lived, it triggered a brief uptick in the price of the digital asset, and likely aided the rising wallet activity rate as investors rushed to take advantage of the growth. Will BTC Price Follow Wallet Activity? Even though wallet activity is up, the BTC price is still straining below $26,000. This could suggest that this metric does not really have much bearing on the price of Bitcoin. Rather, it just points to investors not slowing down usage of the network despite low prices. BTC price recovers above $26,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Presently, investors are still eagerly awaiting a decision on the numerous Spot BTC ETFs that have been filed by fund managers. The outcome of these filings, whether rejected or accepted, will likely be the defining factor for the Bitcoin price going forward. Related Reading: Analysts Are Bullish On ADA But Price Keeps Tanking, What’s Going On? For now, there are no big moves to be expected for the digital asset, especially given the fact that it is still ranging below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages.

42409703,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNiie,1694644362,3 Big Drivers Determining the Future of Crypto in the U.S.,"When we founded Blockchain Association five years ago it was an open question whether or not the digital assets industry could make effective use of a trade association to argue its priorities in front of Congress and other federal regulatory agencies.  Kristin Smith is the CEO of the Blockchain Association.  Some of the most persistent questions in Washington D.C. at the time were whether crypto would still be around in a few years, rather than asking complex questions about market structure, taxing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or if code is protected by the U.S. Constitution. While those issues are still up for debate, it’s clear that crypto’s staying power is not.  As Blockchain Association marks five years since its founding, it’s worth pausing to reflect on the past half-decade and look forward to the challenges that will likely define the industry’s success in arguing its case in U.S. capitol in the years to come.  From President Donald Trump’s anti-Bitcoin tweets, to meteoric market gains in and sobering losses, to the collapse of the Terra blockchain and then FTX – all overseen by an increasingly hostile Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that seems dedicated to pushing the American crypto economy offshore – the digital assets industry experienced major moments of disruption over the past several years.  See also: Crypto Exchange Binance Goes to Court Against the SEC  Nevertheless, even amidst these dramatic moments, crypto adoption continues to grow. Multiple presidential campaigns have felt compelled to issue statements of support for the domestic digital assets industry. And even though the resultant reports are less-than-kind to crypto, it remains notable that the Biden administration felt the digital assets ecosystem was important enough to issue an executive order directing federal attention to study the technology and recommend responsible regulation.  What, then, will the next half-decade hold for crypto in Washington? It seems foolish to make any sound predictions given the cinematic ups and downs of the past five years, but there are several areas where the Congress, the White House and federal regulatory agencies will likely focus.  Money laundering pain points  The first, and perhaps biggest, long term issue relates to anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. While federal law enforcement agencies have become quite adept at tracking illicit transactions on blockchain networks, high profile cases such as the ongoing action against the developers of Tornado Cash demonstrate the salience this issue has across the government.  While some tech-driven solutions have recently been suggested to ameliorate the concerns of law enforcement while maintaining the pro-privacy protections of services like Tornado Cash, the AML issue is likely to persist as a pain point in the federal government’s general acceptance of crypto’s broader use.  Crypto-specific bills, pro-crypto politicians  The second issue is the most likely path to pass legislation through both the House and Senate, and into law. While crypto advocates were right to celebrate the milestone this past summer of multiple crypto-specific bills being voted out of their respective House committees, the now-pressing question of the fate of those bills in the House and then the Senate must be considered.  As the saying goes: personnel is policy, and it's important to try to encourage pro-crypto thinkers to enter government service  Is there enough common ground between the current set of elected officials in these chambers to come to agreement on new crypto regulation? Time will tell as we watch this set of bills make their way to a full House vote, and perhaps beyond, but it’s a reminder that supporting pro-crypto candidates for office is the best, longterm strategy we have to change the congressional view of this technology.  We’ve come a long way over the past few years cultivating crypto champions, and we have a better sense than ever of how Congress as a whole thinks about crypto, but there is much more work to be done.  Regulatory sea change  Lastly, with a major election on the horizon, we address the known unknown of federal regulatory personnel. Depending on the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, there could be a sea change at the relevant regulatory agencies, bringing in fresh faces that may have more enlightened perspectives on the development, use and proliferation of digital assets.  Even if the White House does not change hands, recent legal losses at some of those agencies – most notably the SEC – may turn the tide and persuade those crypto antagonists that a different approach is needed as it attempts to corral the domestic industry.  See also: U.S. Court Calls ETH a Commodity  Continued court losses may push staffers out of those agencies as they become frustrated being on the losing team, time and again. Either way, as the saying goes: personnel is policy, and it's important to try to encourage pro-crypto thinkers to enter government service whenever possible.  5 years ahead  The past five years for the digital asset ecosystem hasn’t always been smooth – but it has galvanized the industry’s strong voice in Washington D.C. At the Blockchain Association, we’re proud to be that voice of the industry with an unwavering mission: to advance the future of crypto in the United States.  We’ll continue to advocate in Washington on behalf of our members – and the industry as a whole – for the next five years, and many more to come.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Kristin Smith,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/13/3-big-drivers-determining-the-future-of-crypto-in-the-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47dad2302c00b4756e16935fbb31d853ef1ae4fc-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409704,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNipG,1694643884,What Will Be the Next Target of the SEC's Enforcement Regime?,"Crypto has made “non-compliance . . . [its] business model,” at least according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. With that belief pervasive among the regulators primarily tasked with regulating securities in the United States, it is no surprise that enforcement actions involving cryptocurrencies are at an all-time high.  In just a few years, we have watched a largely unregulated “Wild-West” be transfigured into a central focus of for the SEC, and, to a lesser extent, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ).  Ethan G. Ostroff and Michael S. Lowe are partners and Samuel F. Rogers and Brett E. Broczkowski are associates for national law firm Troutman Pepper.  Make no mistake, these regulators have not hidden the ball, at least with respect to their appetite for enforcement efforts. They have taken steps to ensure their efforts against the leading crypto players are widely received, including going after household-name celebrities who regulators maintained could have misled investors or illegally promoted cryptocurrency. These enforcement actions have garnered mainstream media attention with some resolved through multi-million-dollar settlements.  See also: The Many Layers of the SEC's First NFT Enforcement Action | Opinion  Perhaps the most surprising aspect of these enforcement actions, however, is how they have been brought to task. One might expect a new wave of tough legislation aimed at regulating cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. But you’d be wrong. Enforcement activity tells a very different tale. These enforcement actions are founded upon law that is, in some cases, 90-years-old.  As regulators continue to ramp up enforcement efforts by relying on novel interpretations of existing law, two questions arise: What is next? And what will break first, our antiquated securities laws or the crypto industry?  What's next? Crypto wallets.  Having closely observed the actions of regulators, we envision crypto wallets and certain digital asset transactions will be the next target.  Drawing from prior federal enforcement actions and signals from these agencies in publications and notices, we anticipate that digital asset enforcement will grow in two ways: the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) may be interpreted to encompass regulation of crypto wallets as brokers and traditional financial institution subject to Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer laws (AML/KYC) will face challenges with compliance in the digital asset space in light of tools such as mixers.  The first sphere of regulation in which we predict expansion involves the regulation of crypto wallets as brokers. This notion was first raised by the SEC in its Wells Notice to Coinbase, sent before it sued the crypto exchange. Among other allegations and assertions made in the notice and repeated in its lawsuit, the SEC alleged that Coinbase Wallet, a product that provides users self-custody over their digital assets, was operating as an unregistered broker in violation of the Exchange Act.  In response to the Wells Notice, Coinbase argued that its wallet product is nothing more than software, and it does not perform any of the traditional functions customary of brokerage activities. In particular, the Exchange Act defines a “broker” as “any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others.”  Coinbase reasons that the wallet can only be used to interface with secondary market transactions, and from Coinbase’s perspective, these secondary market transactions do not involve investment contracts, and therefore, they are not securities. Coinbase further argued that its prior receipt of a 1% fee each time the “Wallet Swap” function was used, which it no longer collects, does not change the analysis.  See also: What Has the Blockchain Association Actually Achieved? | Opinion  The SEC is not convinced. The agency sued both Coinbase and Binance alleging that the firms’ wallet services operate as unregistered broker-dealers.  TradFi transactions  The second sphere in which we predict an expansion of enforcement is heightened regulation of traditional financial institutions engaged in digital asset transactions. With increased focus on new crypto tools and services, we expect that designing, implementing and maintaining compliance systems to comply with AML/KYC laws will pose great challenges to these institutions, and therefore, it will quickly become a target for regulators.  In particular, enforcement of AML/KYC laws in the digital asset space will require these institutions to rely largely on information beyond their control. Take for example a proposed internal policy of flagging transactions where more than 10% of the value can be traced back to proceeds of a theft of assets.  Realistically, a compliance program capable of such flagging will require the cooperation of third parties well beyond the capabilities of most companies in or out of crypto.  First, the theft must be known and the wallets/coins involved must be traced and identified, whether by a government entity or a private investigative body. Then a repository must be created to maintain that information. To the extent multiple repositories of this sort are needed to track the coin flows related to many thefts and hacks, the diffusion only makes the problem more expensive to solve. Finally, once a company that wants to screen for illicit and problematic transactions, it must screen the data against each and every transaction, flagging those that are problematic.  At every step besides the last, the financial institution must rely on the work of others to generate the inputs that help drive the compliance program. This decentralization makes compliance costly, both in terms of time and money.  Rapid expansion  The landscape of crypto enforcement is rapidly expanding, and it has left some institutions feeling bamboozled by regulators. Citing a lack of “regulatory clarity,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said during Fintech Week in London that “anything is on the table, including relocating or whatever is necessary.” It is not hard to imagine that most crypto market participants agree with Armstrong when he says, “[w]e just want a clear rulebook.”  See also: Is Coinbase Disillusioned With Crypto? | Opinion  But rather than create a clear set of rules to regulate the crypto space, the various federal agencies tasked with regulating have instead relied on novel interpretations of decades old laws, which, at their inception, could not have contemplated the very technology upon which digital assets rely.  In some ways, it begs the question: Have the crypto market participants really made their business model one of “noncompliance,” or perhaps is the apparition of noncompliance merely a byproduct of regulatory confusion?  While we wait for the rulebook, investors and exchanges should work with legal compliance teams to ensure that their transactions will fall in line with the ever-differing interpretations of the federal securities laws and banking regulations and their application to the cryptocurrency industry. Each transaction presents unique regulatory hurdles created by the federal agencies’ insistence on applying decades-old laws to a rapidly-evolving industry.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Ethan G.

17600578,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551208,1694638823,SEC Charges Stoner Cats With Alleged Unregistered $8 Million Securities Sale In NFT Crackdown,"In a recent move that intensifies the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) crackdown on the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) sector, the SEC has charged Stoner Cats 2 (SC2) with conducting an “unregistered offering of crypto asset securities.” The charges specifically target Stoner Cats’ sale of non-fungible tokens, which raised approximately $8 million from investors to finance the production of an animated web series. Related Reading: TON Jumps By Nearly 8% Following Wallet Integration On Telegram SEC’s Legal Earthquake Hits NFT Market Once Again The SEC order reveals that on July 27, 2021, SC2 sold over 10,000 NFTs to investors at approximately $800 each, with the entire supply being sold out within a mere 35 minutes. The SEC alleges that SC2’s marketing campaign highlighted the potential benefits of owning the NFTs, including allowing owners to resell them on the secondary market. Furthermore, the SEC claims that SC2 emphasized its Hollywood producer expertise, knowledge of crypto projects, and involvement of well-known actors in the web series, which led investors to anticipate profits from the potential rise in resale value. According to the SEC, SC2 configured the NFTs to provide a 2.5% royalty for each secondary market transaction, incentivizing individuals to buy and sell the NFTs. Subsequently, purchasers allegedly engaged in over 10,000 transactions, amounting to more than $20 million. The SEC alleges that SC2 violated the Securities Act of 1933 by offering and selling these SEC-denominated “crypto asset securities” to the public without registering the offering or qualifying for an exemption. Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, emphasizes that the determination of whether an investment contract qualifies as security lies in the economic reality of the offering, rather than the labels attached to it. Grewal stated: Here, the SEC’s order finds that Stoner Cats marketed its knowledge of crypto projects, touted that the price of their NFTs could increase, and took other steps that led investors to believe they would profit from selling the NFTs in the secondary market. Stoner Cats Settles Charges, Agrees To NFTs Destruction While the SEC’s actions are intended to “protect investors” by ensuring proper disclosures, some critics argue that the SEC’s language and terminology surrounding the NFT market are biased and lack clarity. Crypto enthusiast and investor Adam Cochran expressed his concerns, highlighting that there is no such thing as an “unregistered offering of NFTs” since registration requirements typically apply to securities. Cochran believes that the SEC’s communications should accurately reflect the law to avoid a chilling effect through fear-mongering. In response to the charges, SC2 has agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay a civil penalty of $1 million. The order also establishes a Fair Fund to return funds to injured investors who purchased the NFTs. Additionally, SC2 has committed to destroying all NFTs under its possession or control and publishing notice of the order on its website and social media channels.

42409707,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNisZ,1694637470,Phishing Attack on Cloud Provider With Fortune 500 Clients Led to $15M Crypto Theft From Fortress Trust,"When Fortress Trust disclosed a theft of customers’ cryptocurrency last week – later revealed to total close to $15 million – it pinned the blame on an unnamed third-party vendor.  CoinDesk has identified that vendor, which has acknowledged it fell victim to a phishing attack. But the story may be more complicated than just a single party’s blunder.  The vendor is Retool, a San Francisco-based company with Fortune 500 customers, which built the portal for a handful of Fortress clients to access their funds, people familiar with the matter said.  The theft, which helped spur Fortress to agree to sell itself to blockchain tech company Ripple, occurred as a result of a phishing attack, they said.  When asked to comment, Retool referred CoinDesk to a Wednesday blog post detailing – without naming Fortress – how it had notified 27 of its customers on Aug. 29 that “there had been unauthorized access to their accounts” as a result of a phishing attack.  The attackers targeted “a specific set of customers,” all of whom were in the crypto business. However, Retool said customers that configured its software the way it “encourage[s]” them to consider doing (“if security is important”) were not affected, and that the vast majority of crypto customers use the product that way.  “We’re glad that not a single on-premise Retool customer was affected. Retool on-prem operates in a ‘zero trust’ environment, and doesn’t trust Retool cloud,” the blog post said. “It is fully self contained, and loads nothing from the cloud environment. This meant that although an attacker had access to Retool cloud, there was nothing they could do to affect on-premise customers. It’s worth noting that the vast majority of our crypto and larger customers in particular use Retool on-premise.”  Even though customers have been made whole, the theft from Fortress customers has been the talk of Crypto Twitter this week, with industry leaders pointing fingers at each other and several prominent companies caught up in the affair. But Retool’s role in the affair has not previously been reported.  Crypto vulnerabilities  The situation highlights a challenge that the cryptocurrency market, the way it has evolved, faces along with the traditional finance industry: There are numerous potential points of vulnerability, and problems often crop up because of some unexpected flaw somewhere in the system.  While $15 million is not an insignificant sum, it is a relatively small percentage of the billions of dollars worth of overall assets that Ripple says Fortress holds on customers' behalf. To help Fortress make customers whole, Ripple has made a $15 million “down payment” on its yet-to-close acquisition of the Nevada-based trust company, one person with direct knowledge of the situation said. The payment is a small fraction of the total purchase price, this person said.  A Ripple spokesperson said Fortress covered most of the affected customers but Ripple “stepped in to make the rest of those customers whole,” and all customers were covered within a week.  Theft ‘accelerated’ M&A talks  Fortress disclosed the security incident in a tweet on Sept. 7, but did not identify the “third-party vendor” whose cloud tools it said were compromised. The Nevada trust company stated at the time that there had been “no loss of funds.”  The next day, Ripple, which was already a minority investor in Fortress, announced it had signed a letter of intent to buy the custodian outright.  The companies were already in takeover talks when the theft occurred, but the incident accelerated them, a spokesperson for Ripple told CoinDesk in a statement on Monday.  “Conversations accelerated last week following the security incident via a third-party analytics vendor, but this opportunity makes sense for Ripple in the long term,” the statement said. “Luckily, Ripple was in a position to act quickly to step in and make customers whole, and there have been no breaches to Fortress technology or systems.”  Fortune reported the size of the theft to be in the range of $12 million to $15 million earlier Wednesday, citing Fortress co-founder and CEO Scott Purcell.  BitGo, Fireblocks, Swan  Fortress used wallets provided by Fireblocks and BitGo, neither of which were themselves breached, according to all three companies.  ""The breach happened outside of the Fireblocks’ platform,” the company, known for using multi-party computation tools, told CoinDesk in a statement. “Due to Fireblocks’ key management system, authorization and policy engines, the size and reach of the impact on customer funds were drastically limited and customer funds were promptly restored.”  Mike Belshe, the CEO of BitGo, emphasized that the breach “has nothing to do with” his company in a tweet that criticized Fortress for its handling of the affair. (Fortress co-founder, Chief Technology Officer and Chief Product Officer Kevin Lehtiniitty responded to those criticisms in a tweet of his own.)  Swan Bitcoin, a brokerage firm that uses Fortress’ BitGo wallets to hold client funds, said in a tweet that the coins stored there “did not move during the reported incident at Fortress. The coins are protected by video calls and physical access, and are not subject to any incidents at Fortress.”  The Nevada Financial Institutions Division, the state regulator overseeing Fortress, was notified of the incident on Sept. 1, an agency spokesperson told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Has Risen To Positive Values Recently In a new post on X, the CryptoQuant Netherlands Community Manager, Maartunn, pointed out that buying activity appears to be occurring in the market. The relevant indicator here is the “Net Taker Volume,” which measures the difference between the Bitcoin taker buy and taker sell volumes. When this metric has a positive value, the taker’s buy volume is greater than the taker’s current sales volume. This suggests that the investors are willing to pay more than the spot price to buy the asset; thus, the majority of the market is bullish. On the other hand, negative values imply a bearish mentality is the dominant force in the BTC sector, as the holders are willing to sell coins at a lower price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming Death Cross: Here’s What Happened Last Time Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume over the last few weeks: Looks like the value of the metric has been green in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume had a negative value when the dip toward the $25,000 level occurred a few days back. Still, before long, the indicator had registered a rise and entered positive territory. With this switch towards a bullish mentality, the BTC spot price had observed a sharp recovery below the $26,000 mark. The chart shows that the metric’s value has only grown more positive since the surge, suggesting that significant buying could be occurring right now. The price, however, has only consolidated sideways while this has happened. As for what this may mean, the analyst notes, “either limit sellers are taking control, or this thing will explode soon.” Signs of dropping values of the Net Taker Volume may be worth watching out for, as the Grayscale rally last month had initially seen a sharp surge in the indicator. Still, soon enough, the metric had started to slide back down, potentially resulting in the asset’s retrace. A few days back, another analyst shared a chart showing that the miners had made significant deposits to the spot exchanges. The metric had observed a spike a couple of days back | Source: @IT_Tech_PL on X Generally, miners transfer their coins to these platforms for selling purposes, so this spike could have been a sign that these chain validators had been gearing up for a dump. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Now Close To Extreme Fear: Why This Matters The spike had occurred after BTC’s drop to $25,000, implying that the miners had perhaps panicked at the drop, and, hence, had made the deposits as a reaction. It would appear that the market outweighed the selling pressure caused by this cohort in the end, as the net taker volume had turned positive, and the market had registered a successful rebound.

42409708,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNizB,1694633413,"Bitcoin Steady at $26K, SOL Slightly Dips After FTX Gets Approval to Sell Crypto","The price of bitcoin (BTC) has remained steady Wednesday above the $26,000 level as FTX obtained approval to sell its crypto assets from a bankruptcy court and slightly higher-than-expected headline inflation data in the U.S.  The largest crypto asset rose to $26,350 during U.S. afternoon hours, but slightly retraced after the FTX news. It recently changed hands at $26,135, down 0.3% over the past 24 hours.  Solana's SOL also advanced earlier today, but then swiftly dipped more than 2% following the court decision. The imploded exchange holds $1.16 billion of the token, stoking fears about dumping, but part of the stash is locked as venture investment and not available for sales. Despite the decline, SOL was still up 1.2% for the day.  Aptos (APT), another large holdings of FTX, dropped nearly 2% on the news, but retained most of its gain being up 3% through the day.  Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), XRP prices are little-changed  Other major cryptocurrencies moved roughly in line with BTC. Ether (ETH), Cardano's ADA and Ripple's XRP remained little changed, sliding less than 0.5% during the day.  Crypto exchange Huobi announced today that it has rebranded to HTX, which sent the exchange's HT token almost 3% higher before giving up some of the gains.  Toncoin (TON) surged near 10% on the news that messaging app Telegram endorsed the TON network as its blockchain Web3 infrastructure with plans to integrate it into the app. TON has retraced most of the move but was recently still up 1.7%.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad market proxy, was up 0.2%.  U.S. inflation above expectations  The U.S. government's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for August also came out Wednesday, and the data was slightly hotter than expected. The report showed headline inflation rose to 3.7% on a year-over-year basis from 3.2% a month earlier. That jump was greater than economist forecasts for 3.6%.  Behind the inflation advance were rising oil prices, which hit a new 2023 high late last month, a move that has continued into September.  Stripping out food and energy costs, core CPI fell to a 4.3% in August from 4.7% in July and in line with expectations.  What's next for BTC's price  It's been nearly one month since bitcoin suffered a dramatic decline, falling from about the $29,000 level to below $26,000 in just a handful of hours.  Since then, the crypto has attempted to break out of a tight area surrounding $26,000 on a number of occasions – both to the upside and the downside – but has quickly retreated or bounced back to that range.  The action of traders ""selling the rip and buying the dip"" has become so entrenched over the past several months that it's hard to imagine any marginal economic news affecting this dynamic. While bulls hope the U.S. Federal Reserve might soon begin cutting interest rates, the economy continues to grow and inflation appears to be settling in for a long period above the central bank's 2% target.  While BTC has been remained steady around the current price levels, some analysts highlighted the deteriorating technical picture for the largest cryptocurrency.  ""Bitcoin’s technicals are sliding. Price is trading around support at $26,000, but I doubt it is a hard floor,"" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, wrote in a Wednesday market update.  He expects that BTC will trade in the range between $20,000 and $30,000 until the halving around next April. ""We just have to wait for better times,"" he concluded.  ""We expect an imminent final decline to close out the quarter at the lows,"" QCP Capital said Tuesday in a Telegram update. The crypto trading firm said that a series of negative news over the next weeks such as a more hawkish Federal Reserve meeting next week, FTX asset sales and Mt Gox fund repayment could push the price down to around $23,000.  ""The true bottom will come in mid-late October when the bad news cycle has run its course,"" QCP added. ""We nonetheless remain bullish following that, into year-end and Q1 next year.""",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC | SOL,ADA | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,"Krisztian Sandor, Stephen Alpher",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/13/bitcoin-steady-at-26k-sol-slightly-dips-after-ftx-gets-approval-to-sell-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95b590f9a7cd8ec342a4b0eea3bdb1b27767054b-2580x1446.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42409698,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNiS7,1694633275,What Has the Blockchain Association Actually Achieved?,"This month, the Blockchain Association, crypto’s leading trade association in Washington D.C., marks its fifth anniversary. The lobby shop now has 114 member companies, per a press release today, including big names like Coinbase, Kraken, CoinFund, Pantera Capital, Ripple and Uniswap.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It has an unwavering mission to “advance the future of crypto in the United States, promoting the potential of blockchain technology and shaping policy that ensures its success,” the release said. And that’s surely something most of us can get behind, whether we’re working directly in crypto or observing it in the media. But these are tough times for crypto in the capital. Following the collapse of FTX last November, and a string of scandals preceding it, the industry is struggling to get its message across to lawmakers and regulators. Many members of Congress are openly hostile to crypto’s goals, and the days when Sam Bankman-Fried could get dinner with any big D.C. fish are long gone. Congress members are wary of political contributions and wary of speaking too fulsomely of helpfully regulating an industry that has often lost voters money. There are few votes in championing Web3 anymore.  See also: Crypto Lobbyists ask SEC for Info on Prometheum, the Mysterious 'Regulated' Crypto Firm  So has the Blockchain Association failed? You could argue that. In the last five years, Congress has not passed any comprehensive crypto legislation and it doesn’t seem likely to any time soon. We’ve seen plenty of thoughtful bills proposed, including the second iteration of one from U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, and a Republican-supported stablecoin bill has received strong backing from key members of the House Financial Services Committee. But, with Gary Gensler’s launching a series of noisy enforcement salvos against companies like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance (and Binance’s U.S. subsidiary), many continue to complain about a lack of regulatory clarity.  And, indeed, some have had enough of the U.S. entirely, choosing bases of operations in jurisdictions with more favorable and transparent regimes.  I spoke to Kristin Smith, who has led the Blockchain Association for the last five years, about what her organization’s main achievements have been over that time. She points to three.  First, she said, the association helped beat back a proposed rule from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S. Treasury’s money laundering watchdog, requiring exchanges to collect personal information on unhosted or self-hosted crypto wallets. Second, the association, she said, helped water down a crypto tax and expansive reporting requirement contained in President Joseph Biden’s 2021 omnibus infrastructure bill. Third, the association has helped member companies, such as Ripple, Coinbase and Grayscale, to push legal arguments as they fought Securities and Exchange Commission actions against them. But you might call all these wins as maintaining the status quo rather than advancing the industry’s interests in a more positive direction. They are aimed at protecting businesses in an uncertain environment, instead of creating a world where crypto knows where it stands legally speaking.  The legislative process is slow and that sometimes it takes a decade or more to move things forward.  Of course, nobody could have expected that SEC Chair Gary Gensler would have turned into such a crypto hawk. When he came to office in April 2021, he was widely seen as an industry ally, someone who had taught blockchain tech at MIT and understood its goals. In an op-ed for CoinDesk in December 2019, he had written “I remain intrigued by Satoshi’s innovation’s potential to spur change – either directly or indirectly as a catalyst. The potential to lower verification and networking costs is worth pursuing, particularly to lower economic rents and data privacy costs, and promote economic inclusion."" Four years later, Smith, who is otherwise careful in her wording, is unabashed in calling Gensler “an enemy” of the industry.  See also: Gary Gensler's Evolving Position on Crypto – in Quotes  It’s true, too, that no one could have foreseen that Sam Bankman-Fried would go from a golden boy feted across the capital’s salons and steakhouses to being a defendant in a series of federal prosecutions that could land him in prison for decades. That isn’t the Blockchain Association’s fault. But the events of the last nine months, and the failure of lobbyists to enact meaningful change in D.C., might point to the need for a rethink and a fresh approach from crypto’s lobbyists.  Smith is confident that the SEC will lose its legal arguments intended to frame every digital asset, bar Bitcoin, as a security covered by existing securities law. But it’s likely to be a long slog. The anger felt widely at the collapse of FTX and a series of other high-profile crypto companies will take time to die down. Smith said “the legislative process is slow and that sometimes it takes a decade or more to move things forward.” Let’s hope that in another five years, we’re writing a different type of “take” on crypto’s regulatory standing. But, it might be good for crypto lobbyists to be humble about their “achievements” in the meantime.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | BNB,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/13/what-has-the-blockchain-association-actually-achieved,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f17a4bf0b48aa60848b5b2d8188d004ba2304fb-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17596390,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551177,1694631639,This Latest Move Suggests SEC Lawsuit Against Ripple Is Pushing The Crypto Firm Outside The US,"Ripple may be in the process of leaving the United States market for good as the prominent crypto firm has stated that it will be acquiring the majority of its employee candidates from countries outside the US. Ripple Will Recruit A Workforce Overseas US-based cryptocurrency solutions provider, Ripple has enacted plans to conduct its hiring processes outside US borders. The cryptocurrency firm has stated that over 80% of its workforce will be recruited from countries outside the US that encourage crypto adoption and innovation. Related Reading: SEC Boss Gary Gensler Completes Senate Hearing: Here’s What Crypto Investors Should Know The decision to hire the majority of its workforce internationally can be seen as a strategic move to counteract the effects brought about by the regulatory changes enacted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In light of the legal dispute between Ripple and the US SEC, the Chief Executive Officer of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse expressed his enthusiasm about the crypto firm’s expansion in new regions. He stated that the firm will be focusing on hiring candidates in regions like Singapore, Hong Kong, and Dubai which have favorable outlooks and regulatory conditions on cryptocurrency. “It’s super frustrating that you see markets like we have here in Singapore, where governments are partnering with the industry, providing clear rules, and you’re seeing growth. That’s why Ripple is hiring there,” Garlinghouse stated in an interview with Bloomberg. Presently, the United States does not have a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrency assets, and the US Congress has also been relatively slow in clarifying the status of cryptocurrencies. XRP prices maps recovery above $0.48 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com SEC Lawsuit Developments Ripple has been embroiled in a lawsuit with the US SEC since 2020. The SEC had previously sued Ripple for allegedly raising over $1 billion in unregistered securities offerings by selling XRP. In July 2023, Ripple secured a victory after Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple and stated that XRP was not a security. The SEC responded by filing an interlocutory appeal, however, it is unsure if Judge Torres will grant the SEC’s request. Related Reading: Why The NASDAQ’s Latest Move Is Important For Fund Managers Filing Ethereum ETFs Over the years, Ripple has reportedly spent over $200 million defending itself against the SEC allegations. The cryptocurrency’s native token XRP was delisted from several exchanges in 2021 while its price declined significantly and lost the majority of the gains it had accumulated over the years. However, since Judge Torres’s ruling, leading exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitstamp have already moved to relist XRP since the court did not deem programmatic exchange sales to qualify as securities offerings.

17594249,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551163,1694628058,DCG And Gemini Ink A Plan: Users To Receive All Their Crypto?,"Per a report from TheBlock, Digital Currency Group (DCG) reached an agreement with crypto exchange Gemini. The two parties have been negotiating for months after the collapse of crypto lender Genesis, a DCG subsidiary, and the Gemini Earn program. Related Reading: Gemini Hits Back At SEC Lawsuit With Dismissal Filing The event left thousands of users without funds, leading to several lawsuits and the destruction of the relationship between the Digital Currency Group and the trading venue. The founders of Gemini, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, were public about their negotiations and their objective of making their clients whole. DCG And Gemini Could Exceed Expectations The report claims that the partners proposed a new creditor agreement to return “all of the crypto held by the platform,” when it filed for bankruptcy protection. According to the report, the new strategy aims to compensate clients with the following strategy and methodology: (…) all unsecured creditors a 70-90% recovery with a meaningful portion of the recovery in digital currencies. In addition, unlike similar processes, the new agreement would allow users to benefit from a potential upside in the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum. If these cryptocurrencies rise to $85,000 for BTC and $8,500 for ETH, clients would still receive an equivalent amount. In other words, clients will receive their funds as they were when Genesis filed for bankruptcy rather than freezing the amount in US dollars. Genesis’ parent company described the agreement as a: (…) remarkable outcome for any liquidating chapter 11 case, let alone one in the volatile cryptocurrency industry. TheBlock indicates that the new agreement is yet to be voted by creditors. The above clause, to allow clients to benefit from a potential crypto bull run, is aimed at incentivizing creditors to vote in favor of the proposal. GBTC Gains Ease Recovery For Gemini Earn Users DCG’s $630 million loan to provide respite for its subsidiary would be repaid in cash, partially, and via a financial instrument to be settled by 2025. In addition to this loan, Genesis owes over $1 billion to Gemini’s clients. The report also notes that Genesis posted 60% of this amount as collateral as shares for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. The possibility of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowing the latter to convert into an exchange-traded fund (GBTC) has positively impacted its value. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread Therefore, the discount between the GBTC and the spot price for Bitcoin has been declining and could continue to do so in the coming months for the benefit of Gemini Earn clients. The agreement stated as the report noted: At current pricing, the Gemini User Collateral is worth approximately $607 million. If Gemini agrees to provide $100 million to Gemini Earn users under the Proposed Agreement, as it previously did, or to distribute even a small portion of the Gemini User Collateral to Gemini Earn users, there would be little doubt Gemini Earn users would receive a full recovery.

In a court hearing, Judge John Dorsey said that he approved the motion and overruled two objections that were made opposing the plan. This allows the bankrupt exchange to sell, stake and hedge its crypto holdings, which it said are worth over $3.4 billion.  An attorney representing the ad hoc committee of FTX customers supported the plan during the hearing, while a lawyer for the unsecured creditors committee said all of the involved parties looked to expedite the process.  ""The sooner we can get this process rolling, the better,"" he said.  FTX submitted a filing requesting permission to engage in these activities in August, arguing that hedging its crypto assets would “allow the Debtors [FTX] to limit potential downside risk prior to the sale of such bitcoin or ether,” while “staking certain digital assets … will inure to the benefit of the estates – and, ultimately, creditors – by generating low risk returns on their otherwise idle digital assets,” according to the filing by FTX’s lawyers.  The judge asked questions about whether FTX officials could tell who deposited the assets.  ""[FTX's] view is that the the digital assets we're selling are assets of the debtors,"" an attorney representing the exchange said. Another lawyer said the assets are all in one pool, and are ""not traceable to the individual customer.""  The exchange also asked to hire Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz as an adviser.  FTX revealed earlier this week that it holds $1.16 billion of solana (SOL) – approximately 16% of the token’s outstanding supply – and about $560 million in bitcoin (BTC).

42409711,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNjCP,1694624502,The Protocol: The CFTC Is Cracking Down on Crypto,"Crypto winter continues to be dogged by regulatory attacks and court drama. Most notably, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission placed a trio of decentralized crypto platforms into its crosshairs last week. An aggressive set of charges from the CFTC – which zeroed in on how the trading platforms handle certain kinds of third-party token swaps – contrasted with the regulator’s more lenient image. Tech developments have not abated, however: Consensys announced a pair of upgrades for MetaMask, its crypto wallet, and Infura, its crypto infrastructure platform. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also got the crypto community talking with a research proposal for regulation-friendly privacy mixers.  Today’s feature from Margaux Nijkerk is about Ethereum’s plan to phase out its biggest testnet, Goerli, in favor of a new one, Holesky. Like its predecessor, Holesky will look like a clone of the main Ethereum network, but it will allow developers to test their programs with lower financial stakes. If all goes to plan, the new testnet will be operated by a larger network of validators than Ethereum itself, which should make it better than Goerli for testing applications and upgrades under realistic network conditions.  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  RIPPLE REVIEW: Riding high after its partial court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in July, Ripple Labs, the blockchain developer that uses the XRP token in its payments network, may now have to defend the decision before a U.S. appeals court. In a filing last week, the SEC argued that an appeals court should decide the question of whether Ripple violated securities law in making XRP available to retail investors by putting it on crypto exchanges. ""The Defendants themselves say that the issues have industry-wide significance and are of special consequence,"" the SEC wrote. Separately, Ripple is plowing forward on the business side, announcing last week that it has acquired Fortress Trust, a Nevada-based chartered trust company with a crypto and Web3 focus. Ripple declined to disclose further details when contacted by CoinDesk, though a person with knowledge of the matter said the price tag was less than the $250 million it paid for custody firm Metaco in May.  DEXES DINGED! Last week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged three decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms – Opyn, Inc., ZeroEx (0x), Inc. and Deridex, Inc. – with operating illegal derivatives trading services. Notably, the CFTC reprimanded the smart-contract based trading platforms for supporting tokens that were issued by third-parties. Just a week earlier, a New York court dismissed similar claims against Uniswap in a class action case, with a judge arguing that the decentralized exchange platform was not accountable for third-party “scam tokens” listed to its platform. The CFTC charges were significant in the context of the wider U.S. regulatory landscape. For several years now, the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission have been in a jurisdictional turf war over who should regulate the U.S. crypto industry. The industry has generally lobbied in favor of oversight by the CFTC, which holds a reputation as the less strict agency, but last week’s aggressive CFTC actions drew long-standing assumptions about the regulator into doubt. On the other hand, CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham did pitch a relatively crypto-friendly, “time-limited” program last week to pave the way for regulated crypto markets and tokenization.  TOKENIZATION TALK: The market for tokenized assets could mushroom to $16 trillion by 2030 according to a 2022 report from the Boston Consulting Group, and a wide slate of financial firms – traditional and crypto-focused alike – are positioning themselves to bite out a piece of the tokenization pie. Mirae Asset Securities, a South Korean financial group with over $500 billion in assets under management, said last week that it had partnered with Polygon Labs to develop a tokenized securities network. Meanwhile, a group of crypto industry heavyweights including Coinbase, Circle and Aave formed the Token Advocacy Coalition to foster the adoption of public blockchains and DeFi, and to bring the ""next trillion dollars of assets"" on-chain. The tokenization hype hasn’t gone unnoticed on Wall Street: JP Morgan is reportedly considering its own blockchain-based token for settling payments.  Also:  Vitalik Buterin’s X account was hacked last week and used to promote phishing links. Scammers reportedly managed to loot $691,000 from unwitting followers of the Ethereum co-founder.  Founder of collapsed Turkish crypto exchange Thodex was sentenced to 11,196 years in prison, according to local media.  NounsDAO barrels toward treasury split after NFT holders rally for “rage quit.”  Protocol Village  Highlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.  Particle Network, Web3 infrastructure provider, “has unveiled V2 of its Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) solution,” according to a message from the team. “Major enhancements have been made to privacy, user experience, and transaction efficiency with the latest version…. V2 introduces a number of new technologies including a zero knowledge (ZK) component and a protocol layer that prioritizes user privacy and security.”  BNB Chain, the popular blockchain from exchange giant Binance, releases opBNB, its Ethereum layer 2 network, after months of testing. The new network, which goes live on Wednesday, uses Optimism’s OP Stack to provide fast and cheap transactions for users. The network comes around a month after Coinbase, a major Binance competitor, released Base, its OP-based layer 2 network.  Fireblocks, a cryptocurrency custody firm, is launching a non-custodial wallet service that uses multi-party computation (MPC) technology to reduce counterparty risk and enhance user privacy.  MetaMask, the popular crypto wallet from Consensys, is introducing Snaps, a new feature that allows users to install plugins that extend the functionality and interoperability of the wallet.  Infura, a blockchain infrastructure platform also built by Consensys, plans to release a decentralized version of its service by the end of 2023, per The Block.

A major contributor to this price rise was an increase in positive sentiment around the token as a result of Franklin Templeton, a $1.45 trillion asset manager, filing for a spot bitcoin ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) However, as the market euphoria dies down, the premier cryptocurrency has experienced some market recorrection, with many investors now speculating on the token’s next movement.

In order to confirm the buy signal generated by the TD sequential indicator, Bitcoin must close this week trading above $25,600. Upon fulfilling this condition, the analyst predicts that BTC could trade as high as $28,350-$31,800 in the coming weeks. CPI Report Incoming: What Could This Mean For BTC Market? In other news, many BTC investors and crypto investors are likely on high alert, waiting for the United States to publish its monthly CPI data report, which is slated for release on Wednesday.

""Five years ago, it felt like East Asia had great exchanges and great mining but, you know, very little contribution to the dev and research side,"" Buterin on Wednesday told attendees of the Permissionless crypto conference in Austin, Texas. ""And I feel like that has really massively flipped.""  Buterin was speaking remotely, beamed in via projection screens from a location in Asia, he said.  He commented about Asia while discussing advancements in a new type of ""smart account"" crypto wallets via an innovation made earlier this year known as ""account abstraction,"" or ERC-4337. The upgrade is intended to make crypto wallets more user-friendly, including features to make account recovery possible when users lose their keys.  ""I’ve been traveling through East Asia over the past month and there’s been at least four groups that I’ve talked to, maybe even five groups, that are building some kind of account abstraction wallets,"" Buterin said.  That probably would not have been the case in prior eras of the 14-year history of blockchain.  ""When the average crypto Twitter person says, 'Oh, Asia is back,' they’re really referring to hundred-millionaires buying your favorite dog coins or whatever,"" Buterin said, referring to tokens like SHIB of the Shina Inu blockchain ecosystem, which in turn was a knockoff of Dogecoin's DOGE.

At the time of the reports, over $27 million in crypto had already been carted away by the attackers. However, almost 24 hours later, the reports rolling in suggest that the exchange may have lost double the amounts that were originally reported. CoinEx Crypto Losses Rise To $55.5 Million The initial reports for the CoinEx hack showed that the attackers were able to move around $27.8 million from the exchange. But as investigators dig further into the attack, the losses have come up to around $55.5 million in crypto lost so far.

Not so Bittrex’s U.S. arm, which is having a hard time persuading over a million creditors to shut up and take their money – potentially meaning the Chapter 11 bankruptcy leaves the estate in profit.  Since May, and with the deadline for filing a claim now expired, just under 36,000 customers have withdrawn around $143 million worth of crypto, the company’s lawyer Patty Tomasco told a Delaware courtroom Wednesday.  That’s just a fraction of the 1.6 million customers who were sent emails asking them to withdraw after the bankruptcy was filed by the company’s U.S. and Maltese arms in May.  “One of the things we wanted to explore was why are we getting such low levels of engagement,” Tomasco said, adding that some customers might have been wary of providing the extra personal information required for money laundering checks just to claim a relatively small amount. “They really are making a calculated decision.”  One of the major holders who did seek their greenbacks back was a perhaps surprising branch of the U.S. government – but even so there’ll be money to spare, the court was told.  “The Secret Service had one of our largest accounts, at $6.2 million,” Tomasco said. “We worked with that agency for them to successfully withdraw that amount.”  “I believe there will be money left over” for the estate, Tomasco said, despite having to pay the cost of administering the bankruptcy and fines still potentially due to regulators responsible for policing sanctions and securities law.  Though he wasn’t asked to give any ruling on a mere information point, Judge Brendan Shannon is clearly as perplexed as anyone.  “This case has unusual features,” Shannon said. “All the crypto cases do.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/13/surprisingly-few-us-customers-want-their-bittrex-money-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9cd18e32fcc3737546bfac80dd67c77c620b5a0-799x533.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409714,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNj96,1694619900,Crypto’s Interest in Rates,"It appears crypto investors have been enjoying time away from the trading desk during the late summer months.  With some exceptions (a flurry of excitement around potential bitcoin spot ETFs and trading enforcing upper and lower price support levels), they appear to be less focused on their holdings and more focused on other matters, including taking much-needed R&R.  Amid that relative calm, the U.S. Treasury has been busy at work in the fixed-income market borrowing more and more via bond issuance. This increase has been significant enough to prompt Fitch ratings to cut the U.S. debt rating from AAA, joining S&P’s move to the same AA+ level more than a decade ago. Amped up issuance may also have pushed yields on 2- and 10-year Treasuries up in relation to inflation-linked TIPS.

Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis  Should this have nudged digital asset prices, too? How do interest rates impact crypto asset prices?  Changes in rates can indirectly affect the price of bitcoin (BTC), although the relationship between these markets is complex and influenced by various factors, including:  Opportunity cost: Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies that don’t provide holders what amounts to interest payments can become more alluring to investors when conventional interest rates are low. This allure and demand can push up their prices in a low-yield environment. And the opposite can happen in moments like now when conventional interest rates are relatively high. This effect of interest rates (“cost of cash”) can be slightly offset with proof-of-stake digital assets like Ethereum’s ether (ETH), which do offer a rate of interest from staking activities to secure the network. Crypto is intrinsically global, so rates of interest across the world need to be taken into consideration.  Risk sentiment: Changes in rates can influence overall market sentiment. When central banks raise them to cool down an overheating economy or combat inflation, it can signal a more restrictive monetary policy and a desire to slow economic growth, potentially damping risk appetite (“animal spirits”) in financial markets. In such circumstances, investors may move away from riskier assets like growth stocks and digital assets, including bitcoin, toward safe haven assets that typically pay interest. While very much related to the opportunity cost of capital, sentiment is slightly distinct as it relates to the overall mood of the market.  Inflation expectations: Interest rates are often adjusted by central banks in response to inflation expectations. If central banks raise rates to combat rising inflation, it can erode the purchasing power of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. In such cases, some investors may turn to bitcoin as a store of value, viewing it as a hedge against inflation, which can drive up its price. However, if the inflation-fighting credibility of the central bank remains intact with inflation expectations well anchored, this can result in bitcoin prices falling due to the increase in interest rates (i.e. adding to the opportunity cost of not being in short term treasury bills).  Source: St. Louis Fed, CoinDesk Indices  To answer whether or not bitcoin has been impacting by the recent moves higher in interest rates, I ran a quick rolling regression analysis on the recent bitcoin price history against interest rates (both the 2-year US Treasury yield and the 10-year inflation adjusted real interest rate) and the EUR/USD spot exchange rate to correct for moves in the U.S. dollar. From the results (see figure above), it appears that current bitcoin prices reflect the move up in nominal and real interest rates.  – Todd Groth, CFA, head of research at CoinDesk Indices  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here is some news worth reading:  REAL STUFF: So much of the FTX saga concerns bewildering questions about what was actually real there. How much money did clients have? Where did it go? Etc. On the other hand, a bankruptcy restructuring is all about being super tangible for stuff, searching beneath the proverbial couch cushions to figure out how much stuff there really is and what’s it worth. FTX’s bankruptcy overseers released an illuminating report this week listing about $7 billion of assets, including cash, cryptocurrencies and real estate. That includes $1.16 billion of SOL, the token behind the Solana project that Sam Bankman-Fried supported. There have been worries in the aftermath that FTX is about to dump a bunch of crypto – to cash out – spooking some investors. There is not, however, actually evidence that’s about the occur, raising the question of whether any swoon in prices will be short-lived.  DEMOCRAT’S DISLIKE: At a hearing this week, a key Senate Democrat, Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, made clear he dislikes crypto. He also praised the Securities and Exchange Commission’s application of current laws to crack down on the industry. “I’m glad the SEC is using its tools to crack down on abuse and enforce the law,” Brown said. This has implications for any legislative movement to give the industry the clarity it yearns for since Brown runs the Senate Banking Committee, and could signal that crypto could remain a partisan issue in the U.S. presidential race (Democrats opposed and Republicans supportive).  ETHER TRUST: The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has for a long time traded at a price way below the value of the BTC it holds, though that discount has narrowed as GBTC’s odds of being converted into a more-appealing ETF have improved. But another Grayscale product, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), is seeing similar movement as companies apply to ilst ether ETFs. “The market is weighing higher odds that Grayscale will be able to convert its ETHE product into an ETF following the push from traditional finance giants into the space,” said IntoTheBlock’s Lucas Outumuro.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/13/cryptos-interest-in-rates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2397fde3137537102f81aec1ec70fa01bdfeed6f-5293x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

An approved bitcoin ETF would increase access and signal a bullish new chapter for crypto.  Investors who limit their exposure to the small concentration of mega-cap assets formed by bitcoin and ether, however, may not capture the full value proposition of digital assets in their portfolios.  Broadening the digital asset investment universe beyond the largest single assets empowers crypto portfolios in the following ways:  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Improving diversification  Both within crypto and in the context of an investor's broader asset allocation, increasing the breadth of digital asset holdings may lead to better diversification characteristics while also avoiding the risks of single-token concentration.  Investors should consider the following two questions regarding the portfolio-level benefits of allocating to digital assets:  Does crypto provide long-term diversification characteristics versus traditional assets?  If so, is bitcoin enough to capture this benefit fully (i.e., is it worth allocating to other tokens)?  Below we look at rolling correlations of the top 25 crypto assets to explore these questions:  Figure 1: Rolling 60-day correlations to U.S. 60/40 portfolio (left) and to bitcoin (right), Aug. 1, 2021 to Aug. 31, 2023. Source: Truvius.  The chart on the left shows rolling correlations of daily returns for the 25 largest crypto tokens to a U.S. 60/40 stock/bond portfolio. Over the trailing two-year period, digital assets maintained strong diversification characteristics to traditional portfolios with full-period correlations of less than 0.50 for each crypto asset. This relationship is also more attractive when comparing the correlation of the full set of tokens to that of bitcoin, improving from 0.46 for BTC alone to an average of 0.40 across all top 25 assets.  The chart on the right shows correlations of non-BTC crypto assets to bitcoin. The variation of the correlations, along with modest overall levels, leaves the stigma that “all crypto is the same” looking largely unfounded. Exposure to a variety of crypto sectors and fundamental blockchain use cases may help drive this token diversification.  Accessing a broader set of active management strategies  Active crypto managers focusing only on bitcoin are mostly limited to timing the market – a uniquely challenging undertaking in any asset class. Tried and true relative value investment strategies, or strategies that compare assets to one another, from traditional finance may provide longer-term solutions for those seeking uncorrelated alpha in the space.  Effectively implemented relative value strategies call for both asset breadth and sufficient differentiation among those assets. Figure 2 takes returns for the top 25 crypto assets except BTC, controls for exposure to systematic risk (roughly approximated by bitcoin), and shows the correlations between each token pair’s residual returns (i.e., ETH vs. DOT, SOL vs. LTC, etc.):  Figure 2: Top 25 ex-BTC crypto token pair residual correlations, Aug. 1, 2021 to Aug. 31, 2023. Source: Truvius.  The goal of this chart is to see if the estimated idiosyncratic portion of each token’s returns is differentiated enough from one another to drive meaningful relative value comparison and allow active managers to benefit from increased breadth of the investment universe. The average residual correlation among the crypto asset pairs shown above is 0.29. All else equal, this suggests that on average much of the residual variation among these token pairs (up to approximately 90%) is unique, indicating a substantial amount of differentiation for relative value strategies to exploit.  Conclusion  Multi-asset crypto portfolios encompass a wide variety of fundamental use cases of blockchain technology, offering more robust diversification characteristics versus single-token concentration and unlocking relative value active management opportunities within and across crypto sectors.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Max Freccia,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/13/what-correlations-tell-us-about-the-value-of-multi-asset-crypto-portfolios,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0037e0ef459fd58c197910c2997668ade372f68-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The order alleges that the company behind the animated show, Stoner Cats 2 (SC2), reaped at least $8 million in sales from 100,000 Stoner Cat NFTs representing characters from its eponymous animated web show concept in July 2021. The company's public promotions of the digital art collectibles before and after the collection's initial sale ""tied the success of the show to the value of the NFTs,"" fueling investors' expectations to profit off them, the SEC's filing shows.  ""SC2 engaged in an extensive media campaign to promote the Stoner Cats NFTs both before and after the offering when the NFTs traded in the secondary market, the SEC said in the order. ""[It] engaged in this conduct without registering the offering of the Stoner Cats NFTs.""  The company, which didn't admit or deny wrongdoing in the settlement, agreed to pay a $1 million fine and destroy all remaining NFTs in its possession, according to the order. It has also agreed to establish a fund to reimburse individuals who invested in the tokens.  Stoner Cats is an animated web show about anthropomorphic cats who become ""sentient"" through their exposure to cannabis smoke, according to the series' website. Six episodes debuted between July 2021 and December 2022. The show features the voice talents of several Hollywood actors, including Kunis, Seth McFarland, Chris Rock, Jane Fonda, Dax Shepard and Kutcher, in addition to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as Lord Catsington.  The company ""paid the actors and artists (as well as the producers and managerial and technical professionals on the project) all of the offering proceeds and all of the royalties it generated from secondary market sales in the Stoner Cats NFTs,"" the order said.  Kunis's production company, Orchard Farm Productions, backed the series, according to the show's website. An Orchard Farm executive didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  According to the SEC, Stoner Cats NFT holders were incentivized to trade the NFTs, receiving a 2.5% royalty for each secondary-market transaction involving the collectibles. That encouraged individuals to buy and sell the NFTs in at least 10,000 secondary transactions worth more than $20 million, according to regulators. In addition, at least 20% were resold before the first episode of the Stoner Cats web series had even aired, the order shows.  This isn't the first time regulators have zeroed in on alleged securities offerings from NFT makers. Last month, the SEC brought an enforcement action against NFT maker Impact Theory.

On Wednesday, Armstrong said on X (formerly Twitter) that this review was over and Coinbase has “made the decision to integrate Lightning”  He also took the time to praise bitcoin, calling it “the most important asset in crypto.” Back in August, when discussing the Lightning review, he had said: “I’m all for payments taking off in Bitcoin.”  Lightning is a layer-2 blockchain associated with the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin transactions can be offloaded there for more efficient – and much faster – processing, a prerequisite if BTC has a shot at eventually becoming a common method of payment.  “Bitcoin is the world’s digital monetary system, and Lightning is Bitcoin’s payments layer,” Cathie Wood, the head of Coinbase’s second-biggest shareholder, ARK Invest, wrote on X in response to Armstrong’s post Wednesday. “Coinbase’s integration with Lightning will give its 100 million users an on-ramp to faster and cheaper bitcoin transactions. Hats off to Coinbase!”  Coinbase’s stock was recently up 1.4% following the news.

42409691,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNiBa,1694618468,"Hello Holesky, Ethereum’s Newest Testnet","Later this week, Ethereum will release its newest testnet, Holesky, in a bid to enhance the ecosystem’s testing capabilities. Along with the new network, Ethereum will wave goodbye to its largest existing testnet, Goerli.  Currently, Ethereum has two testnets: Goerli and Sepolia. The networks are like copies of the original Ethereum blockchain, but they are used specifically for testing new applications and simulating transactions.  Goerli and Sepolia are operated by a smaller subset of “validators” than the main Ethereum chain, and some developers think these smaller validator sets pose a problem: “We don't want to hit a scaling issue that could happen first on mainnet,” Parithosh Jayanthi, a devops engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit focused on Ethereum research and development, told CoinDesk. “We want to catch [scaling issues] on testnet, which means we have to have a testnet that's bigger” than the main Ethereum chain.  Enter, Holesky.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Named for a train station in Prague, the goal of Holesky is to become bigger than mainnet Ethereum – meaning a larger set of validators should eventually operate the new network.  By making Holesky bigger, developers will theoretically be able to test infrastructure and upgrades under more rigorous conditions, meaning tests that go smoothly on Holesky should be less likely to face unforeseen issues on mainnet.  Goodbye Goerli  Sepolia, which is newer than Goerli and varies slightly in its design, is expected to remain the primary network for testing Ethereum-based applications. Holesky, on the other hand, is designed to take Goerli’s place as the main testing ground for Ethereum infrastructure and core protocol upgrades.  The new testnet comes after years of growth for Ethereum’s developer community. As more developers have flooded the ecosystem, Goerli hasn’t been able to meet the testing demands of increasingly complex infrastructure and upgrades.  The most visible issues with Goerli surround Goerli ETH (goETH), the test network’s native token. Whereas Ethereum’s mainnet charges ETH fees for every transaction, Ethereum’s testnets denominate fees in their own versions of ETH. The testnet ETH is like play money – used to run tests with lower financial stakes.  Goerli, unlike Sepolia, placed a hard cap on the total supply of its native goETH token. At times of high network demand, this cap can become an issue.  When the goETH cap was set in 2019, Goerli’s architects did not anticipate how much activity the network would eventually face – eventually becoming the primary testing ground for Ethereum’s massive Merge upgrade and subsequent developments to its proof-of-stake consensus system. “We didn’t pretty much know anything and it was impossible to predict exactly where Ethereum would be that far in the future,” Jayanthi told CoinDesk.  Goerli testers can request allotments of free goETH via online “faucets.” In February, however – as a result of the goETH supply cap – those faucets were unable to supply tokens quickly enough to meet demand. “We didn't know what type of supply issues were going to happen,” Jayanthi said.  Some Goerli testers were forced to turn to the open market to secure goETH, and at one point the fake ETH tokens cost as much as $1.60. The rising price of goETH became a significant bottleneck for developers since it greatly increased the cost of testing applications.  There were attempts to increase the supply of goETH, according to Jayanthi, but developers realized the root cause of the problem could only be addressed by starting an entirely new testnet with a better token issuance system.  “Let's start fresh. Now we have a lot more of an idea of what kind of network we want to build. And let's move forward with that,” Jayanthi said.  Hello Holesky  The goal with Holesky will be to support at least 1.4 million validators – more than currently operate Ethereum’s mainnet (700,000) and Goerli (512,000), combined. In addition to remedying some of the goETH supply problems, the larger validator set should allow developers and infrastructure providers to run tests under more realistic network conditions.  The testnet is already courting validators. Just as people “stake” ETH to become validators on Ethereum, they’ll be able to stake Holesky ETH to validate the new network.  Holesky’s release date, Sept. 15, was selected to coincide with the first anniversary of the Merge – when Ethereum became a proof-of-stake network and abandoned its old proof-of-work mining system.  The new network won’t be the last-ever revamp to Ethereum’s testing environment. “Holesky is going to launch now and then we're going to stop supporting it in 2028,” Jayanthi said. “We're kind of giving this information up front.”  Read more: Start of the End?

This move comes almost three years after the popular messaging platform initially revealed its plans to delve into the Web3 space. The crypto wallet is built on The Open Network (TON) and will be accessible via settings on Telegram’s messaging app. On the back of this announcement, the price of Toncoin (TON’s native token) surged by almost 8%. Telegram Finally Integrates Crypto Wallet On Messaging Platform On Wednesday, September 13, The Open Network announced the partnership with Telegram at the Token2049 event in Singapore. This collaboration will provide the messaging platform’s 800 million users access to a self-custodial crypto wallet. As part of the integration, projects built on the TON blockchain will receive priority access to Telegram Ads, the app’s advertising platform. This was confirmed via an X (formerly Twitter) post by Anthony Tsivarev, Director of Developer Relations at TON. Related Reading: Arthur Hayes Predicts Early 2024 Crypto Bull Run And Ascent Of Filecoin John Hyman, Telegram’s Chief Investment Officer, commented on this development: Telegram’s mission has always been to enable freedom of speech, but speech is so much more in this digital age. We believe users have the right to own their identities and assets. With TON Space, users now have the technology to make that convenient. With this announcement, we are putting digital ownership rights in the hands of our entire user base. While also giving TON projects the tools to reach our audience in the largest Web3/Web2 integration there has ever been. Telegram initiated plans to build a Web3 ecosystem as far back as 2019. Unfortunately, the messaging platform had to cool off its initiative with The Open Network in 2020 due to a lawsuit from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2019, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Telegram for raising $1.7 billion through the initial coin offering (ICO) of a token (called Grams), which the regulatory body deemed as an unregistered security. The messaging platform resolved this issue by paying an $18.5 million fine and returning unused investor funds. TON Maintains Positive Momentum – Price Overview In the wake of this announcement, Toncoin registered a nearly 8% price spike. The cryptocurrency currently sits as one of the top gainers in the market today, with a substantial 13% price increase in the last 24 hours. Interestingly, this latest price movement only underscores the token’s market performance in recent weeks. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of TON has soared by more than 36% in the past month. Related Reading: Solana Potential Rebound: Can Bulls Hit Their $30 Target? This positive performance is even more impressive, considering the sluggish condition of the cryptocurrency market in the past few weeks. Most top altcoins, including ETH, XRP, and SOL, have been struggling due to the current market sentiment. While the TON token is currently valued at $1.94, seeing if this latest burst of positivity can drive the cryptocurrency above $2 would be interesting. Nevertheless, Toncoin ranks as the 12th-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of roughly $6.68 billion.

The digital asset platform sees a wider role for stablecoins in traditional financial markets.  SINGAPORE – MetaComp, a digital asset platform, said it is offering clients the ability to buy traditional securities such as money market funds and U.S. Treasury bills for stablecoins – which it converts to fiat – in a first for Singapore.  The firm has accepted stablecoins tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) from as many as 10 of its institutional and accredited investors, co-founder Bo Bai told CoinDesk in an interview Wednesday. The service kicked off last month and has already resulted in volumes of around $50 million. MetaComp is providing the service across Asia.  Stablecoins form the backbone of crypto trading. Tether is the most-traded cryptocurrency, with volume of $22.6 billion in the past 24 hours, more than bitcoin and ether – second and third placed respectively – combined, according to CoinMarketCap data. USDC is the fourth most traded, with $3.5 billion turnover.  “The industry needs a seamless platform that allows investors to allocate their assets smoothly between TradFi products such as money market funds and DeFi products such as bitcoin options,"" Bai said, using industry terms for traditional finance and decentralized finance. ""Step by step we allow investors to harness the benefits of both TradFi and DeFi products.”  Stablecoins, whose value is pegged against a real world asset such as the U.S. dollar, will have applications in the broader financial market, Bai said, and MetaComp is building its business under the assumption that they will penetrate into the real economy.  To provide the service, MetaComp and parent company MetaVerse Green Exchange need to hold three licenses from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country's central bank: Capital Markets Services Licence, Recognised Market Operator Licence and Major Payment Institution Licence.  ""The three licenses together provide us the ability to provide the service, and as far as we know, we are the first to do so in Singapore,"" Bai said. ""As a licensed platform with securities, custodial services and digital payment token licenses, MetaComp and its parent company are dedicated to establish such a platform, which we call Client Asset Management Platform, to enable such a smooth asset allocation denominated in both fiat and stablecoins.""  The only other entity in Singapore that holds all three licenses is DBS Bank, said Bai. DBS' head of digital assets, Evy Theunis, told CoinDesk the bank has not yet begun offering this service to clients.

42409700,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNiYj,1694613600,Price Cuts at Blockchain Platform Alchemy Reveal Persistence of Crypto Winter,"Crypto winter is leading some blockchain firms to cut prices or offer lower-cost service tiers.  Alchemy, a blockchain infrastructure platform that gives developers tools to build applications, on Wednesday released a new payment plan that aims for greater affordability and flexibility – acknowledging the pain of the current market, with major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) still well off their highs despite this year’s rally.  The plan, “Alchemy Scale Tier,” comes amidst a brutal retrenchment for the crypto industry which has sliced budgets for developers who want to continue building applications for blockchains. The plan will consist of two options that let developers choose how much they want to commit to the platform, both financially and computationally.  Developer teams that want to maximize affordability can opt to scale yearly or monthly for different price points, with the option of increasing their computing power depending on the plan.  According to Alchemy, this new plan can save anywhere from 31-85% in fees compared to their most popular product, the Growth Tier plan.  “We saw that there was this kind of gap in the middle where teams that are outgrowing their growth plan needed a cheaper option than what was out there,” Monica Garde, a product manager at Alchemy, told CoinDesk. “We wanted to make sure that you could provide something for them at that level.”  Read more: Blockchain Developer Platform Alchemy Releases AI-Powered Tools for Web3 Builders",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/07/price-cuts-at-blockchain-platform-alchemy-reveal-persistence-of-crypto-winter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73249d7fd766f9d5160cd1f1d8de5f505388b91f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Senate Banking Committee Grills Gensler Gary Gensler, Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was cross-examined by the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, September 12. The committee probed the SEC boss for clarification on the commission’s complex rules changes and the ability of these new regulations to address future market failures. Related Reading: Why The NASDAQ’s Latest Move Is Important For Fund Managers Filing Ethereum ETFs Following the hearing, a Journalist at Fox Business, Eleanor Terrett, revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post a list of key points from the hearing between SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the Senate Banking Committee. She stated that a variety of topics were discussed in the hearing, with Artificial Intelligence being the primary focus, while cryptocurrency was discussed on a small scale. Nevertheless, Terrett explained that the members of the committee brought to light Gensler’s rule-making pace, and his aggressive pursuit of crypto firms in the industry. Republican members of the committee mostly questioned Gensler on his activities in the crypto industry. Some members felt he was encouraging a turbulent environment in the crypto space by enacting new rules and regulations at an excessively fast pace. However, other members felt he was not putting enough effort into positioning the crypto industry under the commission’s heel. Gensler responded by saying that the US SEC was enacting rules and regulations at a determined pace much slower than the committee’s previous Chairs. As an example, Gensler explained that he provided the public with a sufficient timeline of 70 days to make comments on the commission’s most recent securities rule which involved climate change. When asked about approvals for Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETFs, Gensler avoided making any solid statements. However, he emphasized the importance of securities law in regulating digital assets like cryptocurrency and protecting investors in the crypto industry from fraud and risks. “I think at the heart of our securities laws is protecting investors against fraud. They get to decide. They get to take the risk. I’m not negative or minimalist about crypto. I just think it would be best if it’s inside the investor protection regime that Congress laid out,” Gensler stated in the hearing.

Earn was offered to customers of the Gemini crypto exchange, but Genesis supplied the financial infrastructure that ran the program. That turned into a problem for Gemini customers when Genesis was forced to halt withdrawals and then filed for bankruptcy protection.  A filing on Wednesday states that if assorted Genesis creditor groups vote to approve a proposed deal, then “Gemini Earn users are estimated to recover approximately 95-110% of their claims.” Attorneys for Genesis and DCG had previously said unsecured creditors could receive up to 90% of the U.S. dollar equivalent of their holdings through the company’s reorganization.  Genesis' lending arm filed for bankruptcy in January after a double whammy from the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto exchange FTX. A resolution has been delayed for months by talks over the contribution that DCG should make.  In the meantime, an acrimonious, public battle has been waged by the owners of the Gemini exchange, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, against DCG founder Barry Silbert. (DCG is also the owner of CoinDesk.) Tuesday’s filing takes shots at Gemini, alleging the company was not contributing financially to making its own customers whole in the bankruptcy.  The Earn customers’ claim is being calculated based on what will be returned from the Genesis bankruptcy estate, plus Gemini user collateral of more than 30 million shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), worth approximately $607 million, according to bankers for DCG. (Grayscale is another DCG division.)  “Depending on how the bankruptcy claim is calculated, the Earn customers are estimated to get between $440 million and $765 million of a claim,” a DCG executive, who asked not to be identified, said in an interview. “That claim is estimated to receive distributions of $400 million to $535 million. And then on top of that Earn customers get the $600+ million dollars of collateral that Gemini is holding. So, they're looking at total recoveries of a billion dollars or more, which is roughly their total claim. Essentially, it’s a full recovery for current customers under these scenarios.”  According to the proposed agreement in principle, shared on Aug. 29, some of these repayments would be in-kind, meaning some crypto holders would receive crypto, rather than a payment made in actual U.S. dollars.  DCG aims to file an amended version of the proposed plan by Oct. 6 and to solicit votes by Dec. 5. The hope is to confirm a plan by the end of the year with distributions contemplated to be made as quickly as possible thereafter, according to the filing.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/13/beleaguered-gemini-earn-customers-will-be-made-nearly-whole-dcg-and-genesis-say-about-remuneration-plan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1114d122d14431c3004a86ca29494a0b4c52f060-3300x1857.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409709,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNj2U,1694606460,First Mover Americas: Binance.US CEO Departs as Company Cuts 1/3 of Workforce,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder left the crypto exchange and the company eliminated one-third of its workforce, according to a spokesperson. It's been a tough year for crypto exchanges in the U.S., with Binance.US feeling particular pressure. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company in June for allegedly violating securities laws, building on accusations from another American regulator. ""The actions we are taking today provide Binance.US with more than seven years of financial runway and enable us to continue to serve our customers while we operate as a crypto-only exchange,"" the company said in a statement. ""The SEC's aggressive attempts to cripple our industry and the resulting impacts on our business have real world consequences for American jobs and innovation, and this is an unfortunate example of that.""  Crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX started a prediction market that allows traders to bet on the outcome of real-world events. Prediction markets have been around for some time but have enjoyed a surge in popularity thanks to Polymarket. Polymarket, which was fined $1.4 million in January 2022 for unregistered swaps, offers bettors a plethora of contracts from the serious, such as the victor in the first Republican primary debate, to the absurd, like former President Obama’s sexuality, the chance of Russia using a nuclear weapon before the end of 2023, or the existence of aliens. BitMEX’s prediction market, which it’s calling its newest derivative product, is going for the former rather than the latter, starting with prediction contracts on the percentage recovery rate of FTX’s bankruptcy claims, the chance of approval for a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund on or before Oct. 17, and the chances of Sam Bankman-Fried ending up in jail.  Crypto exchange FTX amended its proposal to sell off billions in crypto assets as it seeks to assuage concerns raised by the U.S. Trustee, the bankruptcy branch of the Department of Justice. In the proposal filed Tuesday, FTX would still not have to issue advance public notice of transactions given their market-moving implications – as the prospect that a crypto player selling off as much as $100 million of assets a week has already chilled crypto prices. The U.S. Trustee originally objected to FTX’s plan, saying that any intention to sell bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) should be flagged as widely as possible to give others an opportunity to object. In its compromise, FTX has agreed to keep the U.S. Trustee privately in the loop, alongside committees representing the exchange’s creditors.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows changes in the crypto market depth since November 2022. Depth refers to the ability of the market to absorb large buy and sell orders at stable prices.  The 0.1% depth, a collection of buy and sell orders within 0.1% from the mid-price, has recovered more than the 1%, 2% and 4% gauges, representing liquidity in wider ranges.  The data show market makers are increasingly providing liquidity in a tight range, Kaiko said.  Overall liquidity conditions have deteriorated since January, making it hard for whales to execute large orders.

CoinEx exchange was hacked for an estimated $27 million on Tuesday – a figure that later ballooned to $54 million worth of tokens drained from the exchange as details of several impacted wallets were released by the exchange through Wednesday afternoon.  The hackers siphoned ether (ETH), XRP, tron's TRX, MATIC, solana's SOL, kadena's KDA and dagger's XDAG tokens after exploiting a lax security measure on wallets used by the exchange. CoinEx has since released over 10 “suspicious” addresses on several networks, such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Arbitrum, where the tokens were transferred.  Analysis of these wallets by popular blockchain sleuth ZachXBT shows some transactions were routed to wallets that were involved in a $41 million exploit of crypto betting platform Stake earlier this month. Those wallets are linked to the North Korean attacker group Lazarus, infamous for targeting crypto businesses.  Another address was seemingly directly funded by the Stake attacker earlier this week and then received tokens from the CoinEx attack,  Meanwhile, CoinEx said Wednesday that the impacted funds represented a small amount of total user holdings and that all remaining assets on the exchange “remained safe.”  The Samoa-registered CoinEx traded over $22 million across 730 offered trading pairs on its platform in the past 24 hours, data shows.",NEGATIVE,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/13/north-korean-attackers-linked-to-54m-coinex-hack-blockchain-data-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f23058fb993c002a69b124935324acbbc829763f-1265x712.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17579984,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551105,1694604610,FTX Modifies Bitcoin And Crypto Sale Proposal For Court Last Minute,"In a recent court filing, FTX, the crypto exchange currently navigating bankruptcy, has made last-minute adjustments to its proposal concerning the sale of its Bitcoin and crypto holdings. This move is seen as an attempt to address concerns raised by the US Trustee, the bankruptcy branch of the Department of Justice. FTX’s initial proposal, which is set to be reviewed in a Delaware Bankruptcy Court today, September 13, aimed to liquidate $3.4 billion in Bitcoin and other crypto assets. The market had been rife with concerns about the potential impact of such a massive sale, fearing it could exert significant selling pressure on an already fragile market. Related Reading: Tron’s Justin Sun Mulls Over Making A Move On FTX’s Crypto Stash, Here’s Why On August 24, FTX had proposed appointing Galaxy Digital, led by Mike Novogratz, as the investment manager to oversee the sale and management of these recovered assets. The plan allowed FTX to sell up to $100 million worth of tokens per week, a cap that could be increased to $200 million on an individual token basis. Details Of The Revised Bitcoin And Crypto Sale Proposal FTX’s revised proposal indicates that the exchange will not be required to issue advance public notice of these transactions due to their potential to significantly influence market prices. This decision comes in light of the fact that the mere prospect of a crypto entity selling up to $100 million of assets weekly has already dampened the sentiment of the market. The US Trustee had initially opposed FTX’s plan, emphasizing that any intent to sell off significant assets like bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) should be widely publicized to allow others the opportunity to voice objections. In a compromise, FTX has now agreed to keep the US Trustee and committees representing the exchange’s creditors privately informed. FTX’s holdings, as of August 31, include $1.16 billion in Solana’s SOL, $560 million in BTC, $192 million in ETH, $137 million in APT, $120 million in USDT, $119 million in XRP, $49 million in BIT, $46 million in STG, $41 million in WBTC and $37 million in WETH. Related Reading: FTX Unveils $3.4B Crypto Holdings: $1.16B Solana, $560M Bitcoin – Is Trouble On The Horizon? Notably, a significant portion of FTX’s SOL tokens is locked and will only be fully vested between 2025 and 2028. This means any sale would involve a buyer taking over FTX’s vesting contract, negating the possibility of a sudden massive dump of SOL tokens. Market Reactions And Concerns Renowned crypto trader Hsaka voiced concerns on X about the potential information disparity. Hsaka pointed out that while market makers and OTC buyers might receive crucial price-moving information, smaller investors could be left in the dark. He tweeted: “So with the new FTX liquidation proposal they wouldn’t issue advanced public notice before they start liquidating assets, but would let members of the creditors committee know. The same committee with a bunch of Market Makers and OTC desks on it?” While FTX’s last-minute changes to its liquidation plan seem strategic, aiming to minimize potential market disruptions, they also raise questions about transparency. The court order authorizing the liquidation still suggests that the interests of all stakeholders have been considered. However, the Bitcoin and crypto community will be keenly watching Judge John Dorsey’s decision in the Delaware courtroom and the subsequent market reactions. At press time, BTC traded at $26,124.

A layer 2 refers to any off-chain network, system, or technology built on top of a base, or layer 1, blockchain. The OP Stack is the set of software that powers Optimism, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, that can be used by developers to create their own networks.  Developers said they tested more than 35 million transactions and deployed some 150 applications on opBNB during the testing phase. The blockchain processed a maximum of 4,000 transactions per second (TPS) in that period – a significantly bigger number than Ethereum’s current 17 TPS.  “Scalability and security are the top priorities of opBNB,” said Arno Bauer, Senior Architect at BNB Chain, in a message to CoinDesk. “Before opening the mainnet to the public, stringent criteria had to be met. This included High Availability (HA), 4K Transactions Per Second (TPS), rigorous stress testing, reduced gas costs under 0.2 gwei, fast finality under 1 second, and enhanced security with multiple external audits.”  OpBNB joins the increasingly competitive and crowded ranks of over 50 other blockchains.  Projects can integrate with opBNB through BNB Chain’s extensive developer tutorial and dedicated technical support. To kickstart network activity, BNB Chain said it would soon roll out airdrop incentives alongside fifteen ecosystem projects to attract initial users and funds to the upstart network.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | BNB | OP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/13/bnb-chains-layer-2-network-opbnb-goes-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/463ee8c8dbdfa6b99128660e3e64d57fcf21b9af-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Notably, this corrective phase has adhered to a distinct pattern, encapsulated within two converging trendlines, forming what technical analysts identify as a descending wedge formation. Historically, such patterns have acted as precursors to substantial bullish surges upon breaking free from the upper resistance. The question that now lingers in the minds of crypto enthusiasts: Is Solana poised for a bullish turnaround, or should we brace for more market turbulence? Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Bullish Run Falters: Time To Brace For A Price Dip? At present, Solana is trading at $17.86, according to CoinGecko data. Over the last 24 hours, it has witnessed a modest decline of 0.5%, contributing to a seven-day slump of 10.4%. The intriguing aspect is that SOL’s price currently hovers near the upper boundary of the descending wedge pattern, a crucial juncture where traders are grappling with substantial selling pressure. This position implies that Solana may be poised to either break free from its recent struggles or face further rejection at this trendline resistance. SOL seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko Awaiting SOL’s Bullish Breakout For those harboring bullish sentiments for SOL, a prudent approach may be to await a clear breach of the aforementioned resistance. If such an event occurs, it could trigger a rally pushing Solana toward a potential target of $22.21. Beyond that, the cryptocurrency might set its sights on even loftier goals, with price milestones at $25.43 and $32 becoming realistic objectives. However, it’s essential to note that in the volatile world of cryptocurrency, the bearish sentiment can swiftly gain traction. In such a scenario, SOL could experience a further decline of approximately 11%, potentially targeting the $16.5 price region. Solana market cap currently at $7.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Solana’s Fundamentals Remain Strong One trader, known as Altcoin Sherpa on the social media platform X, offers a perspective that combines long-term optimism with short-term caution.

I’ve got a long-term bag that I’ll just hold because I expect great multiples on it later on. But in the short term, it’s likely going to be painful.” Related Reading: Can Pepe Coin Bounce Back?

U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos also ordered Greenwood to forfeit $300 million, the approximate amount he pocketed from the scheme.  OneCoin began in Bulgaria in 2014, branding itself as a cryptocurrency and telling investors that the token could be mined and had real value. In reality, it did not exist on the blockchain and was a pyramid scheme in which investors were rewarded for bringing in new participants. OneCoin is estimated to have defrauded more than $4 billion from at least 3.5 million victims.  Greenwood was OneCoin's ""global master distributor and the leader of the MLM (multi-level marketing) network through which the fraudulent cryptocurrency was marketed and sold,"" the attorney's office said. This earned him 5% of OneCoin's monthly sales anywhere in the world.  He was arrested in Thailand in 2018 and extradited to the U.S., where he was detained awaiting trial. He pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money last December.

42419605,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUF8Af,1694597340,Crypto Market Shows Signs of Stability Ahead of U.S. CPI,"Bitcoin is trading at $25,933, up 0.66% over the last 24 hours, in the hours leading up to a release of U.S. CPI data.  Despite an earlier seesaw in crypto prices, digital assets have remained fairly stable even as economists predict a small jump in CPI growth in August compared to July.  Economists anticipate a 0.6% rise in the U.S. CPI for August, an increase from July's 0.2%. This surge is attributed to escalating oil prices, with WTI Crude Oil nearing a 2023 peak of $89 per barrel.  However, core CPI, is expected to slow to 4.3% in August from July's 4.7%.  The CoinDesk Currency Select Index (CCYS) has also seen a modest rise of 1%, positioning itself at 1,195.80 while ether, another stands firm at $1,593, despite a 2.2% dip in the past week.  Bernd Sischka, Chief Commercial Officer at PowerTrade, a crypto options and derivatives exchange, said to CoinDesk in a note that this swift rally wasn't necessarily driven by a genuine shift from bearish to bullish sentiments. Instead, it appeared to be spurred by aggressive short covering and a liquidity crunch, leading to rapid and volatile price movements.  ""For a sustained bullish momentum in Bitcoin's price, we'd need to see a consistent close above the critical resistance levels of $26,440 and $26,450,” Sischka said. “Although the market did breach this threshold intraday, it could not sustain above it by the close. This suggests impending near-term market weakness.""  Sischka argued that the U.S. CPI number release generally is a catalyst for more market volatility as overall orderbook liquidity remains low.  Perhaps unrelated to inflation concerns, the price of Curve's CRV token is falling, currently trading at $0.39, down 3.3%, due to an influx of coins on exchanges, top holders reducing their holdings, and recent negative events in the protocol, including a DeFi exploit and the founder's significant token sale.  Inflation Less of a Concern for Companies  A recent note from FactSet shows that the number of S&P 500 companies mentioning ""inflation"" during their Q2 earnings calls has seen a decline.  FactSet’s research shows that 296 companies cited the term during their earnings calls, marking the lowest since Q2, 2021 and the fourth consecutive quarter of decline. Notably, this figure still surpasses the 5-year average of 217 and the 10-year average of 168.  FactSet analysts found that companies that mentioned ""inflation"" during their Q2 earnings calls witnessed a weaker stock price performance in recent months compared to those that didn't.  Is CPI Still a Driver of Crypto Prices?  In a keynote at Korea Blockchain Week, Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX and current Chief Investment Officer at Maelstrom argued that the relationship between CPI, inflation, and crypto prices isn’t what it once was.  Despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes, bitcoin and other risk assets have shown unexpected resilience. Hayes believes that these rate hikes, meant to counter inflation, have paradoxically spurred economic growth by stimulating spending and nominal GDP growth.  “It's different than what's happened before. The standard playbook is starting to break down,” Hayes said.

17575459,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551098,1694596830,Why The NASDAQ’s Latest Move Is Important For Fund Managers Filing Ethereum ETFs,"Traditional financial institutions that have filed crypto ETF applications have focused on a particular market (spot or futures). However, a recent NASDAQ application suggests that the asset manager Hashdex is taking a different approach, which could be a game changer in the Ethereum ETF race. NASDAQ Proposes To List Ethereum ETF According to the application filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the stock exchange plans to list and trade shares of the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, which will be managed and controlled by Toroso Investments LLC. Interestingly, the fund will hold both Ether futures contracts and Spot Ether. This move from asset manager Hashdex is novel, considering that other asset managers have either applied to offer a Spot Ether ETF or Ether futures ETF or filed applications to offer both separately. However, Hashdex wants to offer a fund holding both Ether futures contracts and a Spot Ethereum ETF. Related Reading: Tron’s Justin Sun Mulls Over Making A Move On FTX’s Crypto Stash, Here’s Why The fund’s sponsors believe that combining Ether Futures Contracts and Spot Ether will help mitigate the risk of market manipulation (a major concern of the SEC) and provide the market with a “regulated product” that tracks Ethereum’s price. This fund will help US investors gain exposure to Spot Ether without relying on “unregulated products, offshore regulated products, or indirect strategies such as investing in publicly traded companies that hold Ether.” In fulfillment of the requirement of having a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA) for the proposed ETF, Nasdaq stated in the application that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) will be used to track the price of Ethereum as the CME represents a “regulated market of significant size.” Furthermore, the fund is expected to hold physical Ether. However, the sponsors do not intend to purchase these tokens from “unregulated ether spot exchanges” but from the CME Market’s Exchange for Physical (EFP) transactions. This move is similar to Hashdex’s application to combine a spot Bitcoin ETF with its existing Bitcoin futures ETF. Hashdex, in its application, stated that the CME will be used to track Spot Bitcoin’s price and that all Bitcoin purchases will be from the CME’s EFP. ETH kicks off Wednesday on a volatile note | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Hashdex Throwing Other Asset Managers Under The Bus? Nasdaq’s application mentions the phrase “unregulated spot exchanges” multiple times in what seems to be a direct attack on Coinbase and the applications of other asset managers. It is worth mentioning some of the other asset managers, including Ark Invest, who have filed to offer an Ethereum-related ETF, have chosen Coinbase as their custodian. As such, Hashdex labeling Coinbase as an “unregulated spot exchange” doesn’t seem right, as this could undoubtedly influence the SEC’s decision when dealing with these applications. Related Reading: Analyst Points Out Why End Of 2023 Will Not Be Great For XRP Price Furthermore, asset managers like BlackRock picking Coinbase for their SSA and custodian had already sparked controversy as many had stated that the SEC would not be so inclined to approve an application in which Coinbase is directly or indirectly involved since it has an ongoing lawsuit against the crypto exchange. While many may commend Hashdex’s “innovative approach,” there is a need to be wary of how this approach could hinder the application of others and the eventual effect on the crypto industry in general.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Layer 1s August was a typical month in the tempestuous snow globe of digital assets as a blizzard of volatility and uncertainty swirled around crypto markets. Regulatory decisions, smart contract exploits, solvency rumors, and potential liquidation fears all contributed to a substantial decline in prices. The 30-day performance of Smart Contract Platforms (SCPs) was (-10.7%). The sector was ripe with hope at the end of July after Ripple’s partial victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ((SEC)) when a federal judge ruled that Ripple's programmatic sales to retail investors through exchanges were not securities. It was expected that further regulatory catalysts would materialize in August, including Grayscale winning the right to convert its Bitcoin investment trust into a spot BTC ETF, the potential of other spot BTC ETFs winning approval, and the SEC signaling a potential green light for the launch of Ethereum Futures ETFs. However, prices soured with no approval for any of the ETFs and the SEC announcing its intention to appeal the Ripple ruling. Additional issues that contributed to negative price action were: Questions about the solvency of Binance. The liquidation of a $200M position by a BNB exploiter on BNB DEX Venus. Exploits of staple Ethereum DeFi applications Balance and Curve. Concerns that the hacking of Curve might lead to the liquidation of Michael Egorov's $168M CRV position, representing 34% of all CRV supply. Rumors about the arrests of Huobi’s executives in China and the potential insolvency of the Huobi exchange. Bitstamp's decision to suspend trading of altcoins for US users. Outflows totaling $260M from crypto ETPs in August. While none of the SCPs had a token whose price increased in August, the top performers were ETH (-11.3%) and Tron ( TRX-USD ) (-1.6%). Meanwhile, the worst monthly laggers were ATOM ( ATOM-USD ) (-21.9%), MATIC ( MATIC-USD ) (-19.3%), and AVAX ( AVAX-USD ) (-22.1%). The Neon Glow Coming from Solana Despite the cascade of negative headlines, the value proposition of blockchain technology to non-crypto native users made some large strides. On August 23, Shopify ([[SHOP]], [[SHOP:CA]]) integrated Solana Pay into Shopify’s online retailer platform - this new addition will allow Shopify’s 1+ million retailers to accept payments in the USDC ( USDC-USD ) stablecoins. Solana’s ( SOL-USD ) blockchain will be used to execute these transactions, and each payment will cost only $0.00025 per transaction while settling in under one second. This allows online businesses to avoid credit card fees, which range from 1-3%, and international currency interchange fees, which can be higher. Instant access to USDC also improves the working capital position of small businesses by allowing them to forgo revolving credit options and even earn interest on their funds. This new development follows the path of Solana’s drive to smooth consumer adoption by focusing on user experience improvements like cheap NFT minting technology, the Solana Phone, the Solana Mobile Stack, and Solana Pay. Ethereum’s Layer-2 Performance Layer-2 Daily Active Users Source: Artemis.xyz, VanEck Research as of 9/4/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The long-term roadmap of Ethereum is to alter its business model to become a settlement layer while offboarding the transaction processing to Layer-2 (L2s). This drastic change stems from the technological limitations imposed by Ethereum’s focus on “credible neutrality.” The Ethereum Foundation ((EF)), the entity that maintains and updates Ethereum’s software, contends that Ethereum’s users must believe Ethereum to be inviolably fair for it to replace the existing financial system. The EF concludes that the best way to achieve this impartiality is through decentralizing the network by enabling millions of people to host Ethereum’s open-source software on inexpensive servers across the globe. However, due to internet bandwidth limitations and computer processing costs, Ethereum’s network is handicapped to process only 14 TPS. By contrast, the Visa network can process tens of thousands of transactions per second. The technical limitations of the Ethereum network spawned Layer-2 blockchains, which execute transactions in a less technically constrained environment than Ethereum’s. In turn, L2s settle these transactions to Ethereum in large blobs of data representing a batch or “roll-up” of transactions. These data blobs use up Ethereum’s limited blockspace, and Ethereum assesses L2s hosting fees for this data. The effect of this arrangement is that many more transactions can take place in the “modular” ecosystem of Ethereum. The total amount of transactions in Ethereum with L2s is expected to scale to 220 TPS, with EIP 4844 coming in 4Q2023. Over the month of August, Ethereum’s full ecosystem averaged around 26.5 TPS. However, these Layer-2s are each a siloed ecosystem. This means that smart contracts and stored value cannot cross Layer-2s. In essence, each L2 is like a distinct Excel sheet containing the ledger entries and functions for only that L2. The consequence of this arrangement is that dozens of Layer-2s have been created to compete for the most important smart contracts (blockchain businesses), total value locked, and users. Over the past 12 months, numerous L2s have become consistent cashflow-generating entities, including Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ), Optimism ( OP-USD ), Polygon, Starknet, and ZkSync Era. Currently, these blockchains only generate cash for their parent entities and not any of their own tokens. The daily average revenue of all L2s combined for the last 30 days is $680k, which compares to Ethereum’s revenue of $6.4M. L2s also have margins that fluctuate between 20-50% depending upon the L2 and the price of blockspace on Ethereum. The market share of all Ethereum L2 has grown to 9% of all SCP fees generated. From a usership standpoint, the userbase of all L2s has averaged roughly 3-4x that of Ethereum’s, and both the absolute number of users and the ratio of L2/Ethereum users have been growing over time. Consequently, the amount of Ethereum blockspace used by L2s has climbed to between 10-14%. Total Combined SCP Fees and L2 Market Share of Fees Source: Artemis.xyz, VanEck Research as of 8/28/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. August was a strong month for L2 adoption amid negative price action. Optimism's OP token was the best performer of the bunch, which only lost (-14%) of its value over the past 30 days. The price of OP was buoyed by strong usage driven by WorldCoin ( WDC-USD ) and its registry of new users through its WorldCoin Wallet. Every time WorldCoin registers a new user on Optimism, a Gnosis SAFE ( GNO-USD ) wallet is created. As a result of the onboarding of 600k new users to Optimism through WorldCoin, WorldCoin generated 26% of all fees on Optimism. Additionally, Optimism’s ecosystem and the OP token have been aided by the launch of BASE. BASE is a Layer-2 built using the Optimism software development stack by Coinbase. While BASE is its own L2, separate from Optimism’s L2, Coinbase has promised to remit a portion of its profits to Optimism. BASE, launched on August 9, has averaged an impressive $143k in fees per day or around $4.6M since launch. This amounts to a market share of L2 fees of approximately 20-30%, and BASE’s fees have only been second to ZKSync over the past 30 days. L2 Share of Ethereum Activity 30-Day MA Source: Dune, Etherscan, VanEck Research as of 8/27/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Friend.Tech Overview One of the most interesting applications on BASE is Friend.Tech. Friend.Tech is a social media application that allows users to access private chat rooms with gated content from famous social media personalities. This access is sold on the open market as “keys,” and users can trade the keys. The content creators get some secondary market key trading fees as revenue. The result has been a flurry of activity that has generated $4.2M in fees and 183k unique users since its launch on August 9. Friend.Tech has also catalyzed interest in a new type of application design that allows applications to navigate around the 30% fees imposed by Android and Apple’s app stores. With Friend.Tech, users install the application by adding a website to their phone's home screen rather than downloading an application through a web store. The smooth, simple onboarding process will likely spawn similar application distribution approaches that will be fascinating to see unfold. Friend.Tech’s long-term success will ultimately hinge on whether or not they can attract non-crypto influencers who then return value to their key holders in the form of exclusive content, giveaways, etc. However, based on the “pump & dump” price action of most Friend.Tech keys: it appears that early platform usage has mainly been driven by speculation rather than users acquiring keys for the content they unlock. Another juggernaut of the L2 space is ZkSync Era, which is a zero-knowledge (Zk) roll-up. ZkSync has been earning around $200k in fees per day since July and has earned $6.5M in fees over the past 30 days. ZkSync is the most profitable, widely used Zk roll-up with over $411M in bridged value. Unlike Arbitrum and Optimism, which are optimistic roll-ups that post transactions that cannot settle for 7 days until the passing of a challenge period, Zk roll-up transactions are finalized once they are posted to Ethereum. This is because the rolled-up batch of transactions posted to Ethereum includes a zero-knowledge cryptographic proof of their authenticity. As a result, Zk roll-ups provide a much better user experience that allows users to withdraw funds faster. The downside is that Zk roll-ups have higher settlement costs on Ethereum because they include the data-expensive proof of authenticity. Ethereum Update Monthly Blockchain Fees vs. Ethereum Market Share Source: Artemis.xyz, VanEck Research as of 8/31/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Ethereum maintained its key position as one of the safest digital assets during periods of volatility and saw a slight uptick in users (+3.44%) while seeing its fees drop (-23%) compared to the previous 30 days. Indicative of this decline is Ethereum’s daily transaction fees falling on Sunday, August 27, to their lowest level since December 2022. However, Ethereum retains a greater than 70% market share of all smart contract platform fees, and its dominance persisted in the month of August. Ethereum staking continues to grow with 26M ETH staked, around 22% of the total ETH supply, with 815k validators. Part of Ethereum’s success, despite its fee decline, is that it is no longer simply an execution layer. Ethereum has begun to reap the benefits of also being a settlement layer that generates revenue from hosting L2 transaction data. This business arrangement results in Ethereum benefiting from the success of projects like Coinbase’s BASE. Another contributing factor to Ethereum’s success is the slow evolution of ETH as a collateral asset. Launched in June, Eigenlayer enables holders of ETH and ETH LSTs to deposit their funds into Eigenlayer and opt into backing various projects that employ the value of those funds. This value can be used to collateralize new protocols, applications, and financial arrangements. Projects like oracles, bridges, or on-chain insurance businesses could back their projects’ trust models with Eigenlayer-staked assets. This enhances the potential for new projects to leverage the value rented from Eigenlayer stakers to create novel, trust-based businesses. The result is that ETH is molting from its core use case as the base asset for securing and transacting on Ethereum to being an important collateral asset. This will establish new, permanent demand channels for ETH that make it substantially more useful. Eigenlayer recently upped the limit on the total amount of locked ETH it would accept to 141k ETH worth $23.3M, which will grow again as Eigenlayer becomes more mature. Ethereum Upcoming Catalyst: EIP 4844 EIP 4844 is an upgrade to Ethereum that will improve Ethereum’s scalability and is slated to occur in 4Q2023. Called Proto-Danksharding, the EIP will allow Ethereum to settle L2 transaction batches in a separate memory storage scheme called a “side car.” The result of this upgrade will be the ability of Layer-2s to settle more transactions to Ethereum and do so with less cost. These data side cars will not be permanently stored on Ethereum but will persist for only about a month. Ethereum will also have more blockspace for its native transactions previously occupied by L2 settlements. As a direct consequence of EIP 4844, L2 settlement costs to Ethereum will drop significantly. Unless more L2 settlements occur or more transactions happen on Ethereum to make up for the cost difference, Ethereum’s revenue may decline. Another potential side-effect is that more users may migrate to transacting on L2s because the cost of doing so should drop significantly. Interestingly, because L2 businesses costs are mainly settlement fees paid to Ethereum, L2 profit margins may increase if they can successfully capture some of the saved costs. In EIP 4844, the variable cost of settling transactions will be around 90% cheaper for L2s. With current margin estimates of 30% for an L2 like Optimism, if Optimism captures all of the cost savings as profits, it will see margins jump to 93%. However, competition for L2 power users will likely drive transaction prices lower across all L2s, and where margins will end up is uncertain. Unless Ethereum can find new sources of blockspace demand vacated by L2s in the EIP 4844 upgrade, it could see 10-14% of its revenue derived from L2 settlements decline by 90%. We will discuss EIP 4844 in more detail in an upcoming Ethereum piece. TRON Update The fundamentals for Tron continue to be relatively strong amid the backdrop of greater crypto weakness. Tron has been averaging around $1M in fees per day in August, with around $5.27B in TVL, 1.35M daily active users (DAUs), and $44B in on-chain stablecoins (almost entirely USDT ( USDT-USD )). Despite a dramatic 30% loss in DAUs from July, Tron still boasts the highest amount of DAUs among all smart contract platforms, including Bitcoin. Tron’s main use case is the utilization of USDT for payments among developing countries, and Tron averages around $9B transferred each day. While Tron has a functioning DeFi ecosystem, it is not decentralized, as its top applications are controlled by Justin Sun, who seems compelled to add his name to everything he touches. JustLend, JustStables, SUNswap, and the mysterious stUSDT collectively control 99.7% of all chain TVL. Additionally, TRON’s fees exhibit a peculiar seasonality as the majority of fees, and by proxy on-chain volume, occur during the week while weekends see remarkably consistent lulls in activity.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The month of August was not kind to ATOM as its price fell (-21.9%) and was one of the worst performers among smart contract platforms. ATOM, which we wrote a deep-dive on in August 2022, was grabbing the market share of the crypto developer base. Cosmos’ app-chain thesis was attracting adherents amongst important financial players in crypto. After last September’s Cosmos conference, many were excited to see Cosmos' core contributors finally unveil a value accrual business model for the ATOM token. This business was termed Interchain Security ((ICS)), and its economics centered around utilizing the value of the ATOM tokens to back a blockchain called the Cosmos Hub that would lend security to nascent blockchains. This would be accomplished by having each Cosmos Hub validator, all 175 of them, run each security consumer blockchain’s software. If the Cosmos Hub validators reported transactions honestly and provided server uptime, they would receive payments from the consumer chain for running consumer chain software. Effectively, this would allow each consumer chain to piggyback off the security of the staked ATOM because if the Cosmos Hub validators tried to cheat or steal funds, the staked ATOM behind those validators would be seized. In turn, to attract ATOM stakers, the Cosmos Hub validators would reward the stakers with some portion of the revenue from consumer chains. However, progression towards building this vision has been incredibly slow. At the time of writing, only three chains had been onboarded to the Cosmos Hub, and many of the most important chains by TVL, such as Kava ( KAVA-USD ), Osmosis ( OSMO-USD ), and Axelar, have opted away from joining the Cosmos Hub. Likewise, the Cosmos ecosystem has been marred by negative sentiment generated by the glacial launch pace of native USDC launch, dwindling user interest in anticipated novel Cosmos DeFi chains such as Sei, Injective ( INJ-USD ), and Bera, and community disagreement on the Cosmos Hub business model. At this point, there are currently several ATOM-funded proposals to change the economics of the Cosmos Hub. While Cosmos has been gaining the market share of developers, it is uncertain if that will contribute to ATOM’s value. Until the economics of ATOM change and more chains opt into the ATOM security model, ATOM would appear to be a token without an economic purpose to justify its $2.1B market capitalization. Polygon Update Polygon’s MATIC token continued its underperformance for the month of August, losing (-19.3%) of its value. While MATIC did not see a significant decline in usership (-4.7%) amid a greater crypto drawdown of (-10.3%), it did see the third largest month-to-month fee decline (-29%) among SCPs. Part of the decline in Polygon’s token price can be attributed to the continued underperformance of Polygon’s business development initiatives. Over the past 18 months, Polygon has spent hundreds of millions of MATIC tokens securing partnerships with NIKE ( NKE ), adidas ([[ADDYY]], [[ADDDF]]), Starbucks ( SBUX ), and Reddit ( REDDIT ). Despite these initiatives, the spent funds’ contribution to Polygon’s bottom line has dwindled immensely. While usership has increased over 6-, 12-, and 18-month intervals on Polygon, fees are down (-2%) over the past year and (-18%) lower than 18 months ago. Polygon’s chief applications, Planet IX, ChainLink ( LINK-USD ), and Uniswap ( UNI-USD ), have seen their usage, as measured by gas fees, decline (-37.1%), (-28.8%), and (-50.2%) month to month. Part of this decline is strong competition by L2s, attracting new and interesting projects. Another significant portion is due to useability issues with Polygon’s blockchain, including chain re-organizations, network outages, and security concerns. Though there is a substantial upgrade in the works that will address these issues, the timing of the releases is slower than needed. For example, the first upgrade of Polygon’s Mainnet to Validiums is not expected until late 1Q2024. Additionally, there is concern that the SEC may deem Polygon’s MATIC token a security. An indicator of this fear is the Bitstamp exchange delisting Polygon’s MATIC in early August. Polygon Fees vs. DAU 30-Day Moving Average Source: Artemis.xyz, VanEck Research as of 8/28/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The Polygon team is currently addressing the issues plaguing its technical architecture and redesigning its MATIC token's economic model. To prevent Polygon blockchain from having periodic re-org, Polygon will transition its Mainnet, called PoS, to a Validium-based system. A knock-on effect of this move will be that Polygon’s gas fees paid on Ethereum will also decline and make transactions on Polygon. This move is a stop-gap measure before Polygon converts to a true zero-knowledge (zk) ecosystem. Furthermore, Polygon also introduced a revamped token design that centers around Polygon’s lead in zero-knowledge (zk) scaling technology. In the future set-up of Polygon, the MATIC token will be replaced by the POL token, which will accrue value by backing entities performing “useful work.” The MATIC token will be 1:1 convertible to the new POL token. The new design of Polygon will revolve around a series of bridges connecting various blockchains that will be secured under the aegis of a validator set backed by the POL token. Polygon will provide the tooling and support for entities that want to build their own Polygon blockchains, called “supernets.” Additionally, a new agent, the zk prover, will play a pivotal role in the system by generating and verifying zk authenticity proofs of Polygon blockchains. The POL token will be used to back these provers as well. The result of Polygon’s design improvements is a host of new token sinks that perform important ecosystem functions for Polygon while providing value for the tokenholders. Finally, to create a sustainable ecosystem fund and security budget for validators, the POL token will implement a 2% inflation, unlike the capped supply MATIC token. Avalanche Update Avalanche Gas Usage by Application Category Source: Artemis.xyz, VanEck Research as of 8/29/2023 Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The price performance of AVAX in the month of August is poor, around (-22.1%), but is better than expected given Avalanche’s dismal fundamental metrics. According to some important measurements of a blockchain’s health, including fees, daily active users, DEX volume, and TVL, Avalanche is dramatically ailing. Compared to its peers, Avalanche saw the largest month-to-month decline in Daily Active Users (-28.5%) and the second worst decline in fees (-40%), DEX Volume (-46.9%), and TVL (-14.1%). The monthly transaction volume on Avalanche is the lowest since August 2022, while TVL is smaller than it has been at any point since August 2021. While the decline in activity on Avalanche is dismal on a month-to-month basis, it follows a late spring 2023 surge in usage. However, this bump in activity was not organic but resulted from several large traders gaming an airdrop from the LayerZero project. The evidence to support this contention is that much of the activity on Avalanche has revolved around utilizing the LayerZero products such as the LayerZero bridge, the Stargate DeFi application, and BTC.b (bridged Bitcoin using LayerZero). In fact, since May 2023, bridging applications on Avalanche, almost exclusively the LayerZero-associated products, have accounted for 50-60% of all gas fees on Avalanche, 30-35% of all active wallets, and 25% of all transactions. Before the surge, bridging-related applications ranged around 5% of gas fees on Avalanche. However, the most concerning aspect of this decline in activity is that Layer-Zero airdrop-related activity has remained constant as a percentage of gas fees and usership. This implies that the total figures for Avalanche have been declining as a whole, not just from airdrop farmers' pairing back activity. DeFi: Economic Activity Continues to Decline The MarketVector Decentralized Finance Leaders Index underperformed BTC and ETH, falling 21% in August as on-chain economic activity dwindled. The underperformance was exacerbated by UNI, representing ~30% of the index, declining 33.5% as investors sold tokens to capture gains from its outperformance in July. Other major index components fared slightly better, with MKR, AAVE, and LDO returning -6%, -14%, and -15%, respectively. The total value locked ((TVL)) across DeFi fell 8% in August, from $40.8 billion to $37.5 billion, slightly outperforming Ethereum’s 10% pullback. Decentralized exchange volume experienced a more severe decline to $52.8 billion in August, 15.5% lower than in July. While DeFi tokens had a lackluster performance in August, many of the core DeFi protocols experienced positive developments. Uniswap Labs won a class action lawsuit, and Maker and Curve saw TVL growth in their stablecoins. August DeFi Volume Falls 15% Source: DefiLlama as of 8/31/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Uniswap Wins Lawsuit, Sets Precedent for Decentralized Protocols While the UNI token underperformed its peers in August, the leading decentralized exchange celebrated a major victory when the Southern District Court of New York dismissed a class action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleged that Uniswap contributors, including Uniswap Labs, Uniswap Foundation, Hayden Adams, and multiple venture investors, had violated securities laws by selling unregistered securities on the platform. The court ruled that Uniswap cannot be held liable for any damage caused by third parties misusing the protocol because Uniswap is a decentralized exchange. As such, it does not have control over how its protocol is used. Judge Katherine Failla, who is also presiding over the SEC v. Coinbase case, wrote in her decision that ""this case is more like an effort to hold a developer of self-driving cars liable for a third party's use of the car to commit a traffic violation or to rob a bank."" The ruling is a huge win for Uniswap and other decentralized protocols, as it sets a precedent that could be used to defend other open-source crypto developers and contributors from unfounded lawsuits. MakerDAO Drives DAI Adoption by Increasing the DAI Savings Rate ((DSR)) DAI Market Capitalization Reverses Trend Source: VanEck Research as of 8/31/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. In August, the amount of DAI deposited in MakerDAO’s DAI Savings Rate ((DSR)) contract increased 278%, settling at ~1.3 billion DAI following the interest rate increase from 3% to 8%. Rune Christensen, the founder of MakerDAO, lauded the success of the rate increase, which grew DAI’s total market capitalization by 19% to $5.35 billion over the course of the month. However, many in the MakerDAO community were uneasy with the results of the rate change due to whales being able to borrow large amounts of DAI at an interest rate below the 8% deposit interest they received for depositing in the DSR. This effectively allowed whales to fill up the DSR by arbitraging the borrow and deposit rates, resulting in a situation where MakerDAO’s treasury was essentially paying whales the difference. To alleviate this, Rune proposed the DAO lower the DSR to 5% and raise DAI borrow rates to match the DSR to disincentivize users from depositing borrowed DAI in the DSR. To prevent capital departure upon lowering the deposit interest rate, MakerDAO implemented the SPK pre-farming airdrop, which will reward Spark protocol borrowers in an upcoming airdrop of the SPK token. The goal here is to attract as much TVL as possible to boost market trust in the product while mitigating the expense of funding the DSR, which, at the current rate and level of deposits, is costing MakerDAO $65 million annually to fund. While this expense should be covered by the revenue generated from Maker’s U.S. Treasury Bond holdings, other stablecoins, such as USDC and USDT, have developed much larger market share without providing high yield to holders, calling into question the long-term sustainability of the DSR, especially once the Spark airdrop concludes. By the end of the month, Spark’s TVL had grown to $455 million, representing a monthly increase in deposits of 712%, with wstETH constituting 78% of deposits. Curve Update: Recovering from July’s Exploit Curve Revenue by Source Source: VanEck Research, Curvemonitor as of 8/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Curve ( CRV-USD ) has begun to show signs of recovery from the Vyper compiler exploit last month that caused Curve’s TVL to fall 48% to $1.68 billion. In the first week of August, about $750 million of TVL returned as Frax redeposited its base pool liquidity, and other investors regained confidence in the platform's security. Additionally, crvUSD saw significant growth this month and achieved a new all-time high of $114 million borrowed. The growth of crvUSD has allowed it to become a significant contributor of revenue for the platform, with crvUSD fees exceeding fees collected from all non-mainnet liquidity pools in 3 of the 4 last weeks. Curve’s governance token, however, has not seen promising signs of recovery, with its price falling 24% in August to $0.45. Due to the price decline, investors who bought CRV OTC from Michael Egorov last month are now only 12.5% above the water on their investment, with 5 months left until they can sell. If crvUSD can continue to grow to the point that it offsets the drop in exchange revenue caused by decreasing DeFi volume, CRV price may see some relief. Still, until then, declining DeFi volume remains a solid headwind for CRV appreciation. High-Interest Rates: A Strong Headwind to Stablecoin Market Growth Stablecoin Market Capitalization Source: Artemis as of 8/31/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Despite Maker and Curve’s success in expanding the supply of their respective stablecoins, the aggregate market capitalization of stablecoins continued to trend down, falling 2% in August to $119.5 billion, according to data from Artemis. This is mainly a result of elevated interest rates in traditional finance, which have incentivized investors to dump their stablecoins and move into money market funds where they can receive ~5% risk-free yield. With U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) chair Jerome Powell noting that further interest rate increases in 2023 may be necessary, we think it is unlikely the stablecoin trend will reverse in the near term. Until interest rates begin to recede or a stablecoin provider finds a seamless way to bring this yield on-chain, as MakerDAO attempts to do, the risk and opportunity cost of holding stablecoins will continue to drive out capital. PayPal’s ( PYPL ) launch of their first stablecoin, PYUSD, could also bolster stablecoin adoption. While PYUSD doesn’t offer yield to holders, it could garner broader adoption if it introduces additional utility not offered by other stablecoins, such as the ability to conduct e-commerce payments. Lack of Metaverse Development & Usership Stifle Performance In August, the MarketVector Media and Entertainment Leaders Index fell 23.4% as metaverse tokens continued to underperform ETH. APE ( APE-USD ) fell 23%, while MANA ( MANA-USD ) and SAND ( SAND-USD ) fell 22.5% and 27%, respectively. The selling pressure results from continued token unlock, causing inflation and increasing investor doubt that metaverse platforms can deliver on the vision they promised. Throughout the bear market, data analytics platforms DCL-Metrics and DappRadar have reported declining usership metrics in both The Sandbox and Decentraland, which have 3,600 and 4,500 monthly active users, respectively. Meanwhile, APE’s feature product, the Otherside metaverse, is still developing while token staking rewards continue to inflate supply and drive sell pressure. However, Yuga Labs announced that its Legends of the Mara strategy game will be released in open beta in September, presenting a potential tailwind for APE. We believe these tokens will continue to underperform ETH until there is a strong reversal in the usership trend brought about by significant product enhancements or new releases. Zynga Enters Crypto Gaming as Usership Stagnates Zynga, a notorious Web2 casual game developer, announced the launch of their first Web3 gaming platform, Sugartown. Not much information was released about Sugartown as an attempt to bolster interest by maintaining a veil of mystery and slowly releasing information to the public. However, we know there will be an upcoming free mint for “Ora” NFTs, potentially having governance powers within the Sugartown platform. Additionally, Zynga made clear that Sugartown will not be a standalone game. Zynga described the nature of Sugartown as a transmedia IP and a gaming and community-building platform. Since other Web3 products have struggled to create compelling IP to attract gamers, Zynga has leveraged its existing IP by featuring 3 of its Farmville characters in Sugartown. The announcement of Sugartown comes as crypto gaming continues to struggle to bring in new users. In August, the user count amongst the top crypto games increased by 1.6% but is down about 35% compared to the same period a year ago. As a well-established game developer with a strong track record of success, we believe Zynga has the expertise to develop and market Web3 IP that could bring Web3 gaming to the masses. NFT Volume Hits 2.5-Year Low as SEC Files Enforcement Action & Recur Shuts Down Monthly NFT Volume Hits 2.5-Year Low Source: Cryptoslam! as of 8/31/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. August was a brutal month for NFT enthusiasts, as negative news for the market continued to outpace positive developments. NFT volume fell again in August, marking 6 months straight of declining volume. Cryptoslam! reported that NFT secondary sales in August generated only $390 million of volume, marking the lowest monthly volume for NFTs since January 2021. The 23% drop in monthly volume highlights the growing apathy in NFT markets, where little product improvement has occurred, and a lack of new entrants has inhibited the sector’s ability to drive speculation. Blur continued facilitating most Ethereum NFT volume in August, commanding a 65% market share of total volume and 37% of trades. Meanwhile, OpenSea retained its majority share of NFT trades, conducting 61% of trades and driving 21% of Ethereum NFT volume. Despite Blur’s success in dethroning OpenSea as the leading NFT marketplace by volume, the continued lack of investor interest in the NFT market creates major headwinds for BLUR, which fell 30% in August. Not only has there been a lack of new entrants to the NFT scene, but existing franchises expected to drive development and adoption are running out of cash. Notably, Recur announced they would close shop over the coming months due to the NFT winter. Recur raised $50 million in Sept. 2021 at a $333 million valuation and garnered market-wide attention after announcing NFT collections for several big brands, including Hello Kitty and Nickelodeon. As part of the winddown process, Recur will migrate all media and attributes for the >380k NFTs minted by the platform to IPFS by November 22, with NFT deposits and other platform actions being disabled in the weeks preceding the IPFS migration. The closure of Recur shows that even well-funded companies are struggling to survive in the current environment. Furthermore, the SEC launched their first enforcement action against NFTs in August, alleging that L.A.-based Impact Theory sold unregistered securities in their $30 million sale of Founder’s Key NFTs. The SEC alleged that Impact Theory marketed the NFTs as assets that would appreciate with the success project, constituting an investment contract. In a dissent on the Commission’s decision, Commissioner Peirce and Uyeda emphasized that while they worry about people buying NFTs without knowing how their funds will be used, the statements made by Impact Theory were not indicative of an investment contract just as an artist’s commitment to build their brand doesn’t justify labeling their paintings as investment contracts. Impact Theory agreed to settle with the SEC, requiring the team to destroy any NFTs they possess, set up a fund to reimburse investors, and pay more than $6.1 million in penalties. One NFT-based game that recently found a clear product-market fit is DraftKings’ ( DKNG ) Reignmakers, which merges card collecting with fantasy sports using NFTs on the Polygon blockchain. Over the next four quarters, we estimate the Reignmakers franchise (an NFT-based fantasy sports game on Polygon) will generate $70M+ in high-margin revenues, accounting for 3% of DraftKing’s top line and 5% of 2022 full-year profits.

42419613,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUF8Iv,1694593541,Web3 Doesn’t Care About Bitcoin Prices – And Other Musings From Korea Blockchain Week,"“What do you do in Web3; What's your token technology?”  “Crypto” and “blockchain” were downplayed at the crypto conference Korea Blockchain Week (KBW) in favor of newer ideas – and even newer terms to define the industry – over an action-packed 48 hours in Seoul last week.  A packed venue and hopeful cheers from an estimated 10,000 people attending the many Web3 panels could have made one doubt whether the industry remains in one of the deepest bear markets in its young history. Most did not care about bitcoin’s mostly languishing price.  In true flashy crypto style, the venue was much smaller than last year’s KBW – giving the illusion of a packed place that was a function of lower square footage and not higher interest. The prices at the hotel restaurant, however, (30,000 won, or $22, plus taxes for a single piece of cold shrimp) might give even a bull-market crypto chief financial officer pause.  Moreover, there seemed to be no unanimous definition for what Web3 really meant. At the various event booths, some called it the new internet, some took it as an evolution of token-based protocols to NFTs that tie in with entire social cultures, while some proudly wore T-shirts that proclaimed Web3 to “be the future.”  On the sidelines and in cafes around the venue, crypto’s vulture capitalists searched for shiny new products to invest whatever remaining money they still had. Product founders searched for unsuspecting new users, new users searched for higher prices and prices searched for a catalyst to end the current market lull.  The ongoing absence of a catalyst has sprung forth a reality that rich crypto projects and investors now face – an abject lack of real retail users that drive business revenue (and not just token prices).  In side events attended by CoinDesk, salespeople pitched their tools and analytics software to each other. Just don’t ask anyone to actually pay for these products.  ""Bear markets serve as a reality check of sorts, especially for projects without sustainable business models,” Veronica Wong, founder of crypto wallet firm SafePal, told CoinDesk at one such side event.  “Founders are inevitably struggling to raise funds as liquidity is drying up, and some projects are focusing on pitching their services to each other in a B2B-esque approach as retail demand is waning. This isn't necessarily a net negative, though, as it strengthens the foundation for adoption and usage when market conditions recover (assuming there are genuine use cases and utility provided),” she added.  CoinDesk spoke to locals outside of crypto circles to gauge awareness of the sector. Two taxi drivers had heard, but had not invested, in bitcoin; a few young hotel staff knew about Terra’s doomed LUNA tokens; while an elderly gentleman in a lift called the sector “baby money” with a wide smirk.  What some founders said  Crypto personalities took the KBW stage to project their versions of where the industry is at and where it is going. Most hot topics converged around privacy, scalability through layer-2 blockchains, blockchain gaming in markets like Asia, the ongoing regulatory troubles in important markets such as the U.S. and creating easy-to-use applications that the general masses both appreciate and understand.  Arthur Hayes, owner of Maelstrom Ventures and founder of BitMEX, kicked off the conference with a macro-focused speech. Hayes said that the steepest Federal Reserve rate hike cycle in decades should have killed bitcoin and other risk assets. It didn’t and a new relationship between the two was forming.  Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin – speaking virtually – complained about how Ethereum nodes are centralized and mostly run on servers such as Amazon Web Services, creating a vulnerability for hackers or anti-crypto U.S. authorities to attack.  Buterin noted fixing the node issue was one of the key things Ethereum infrastructure providers and node validators, a term for users who provided computing resources to the network, should work on in the coming years.  Tron’s Justin Sun entered the arena with two models, two bodyguards and two cameramen, commanding nearly everyone’s attention – while making non-crypto hotel guests scratch their heads – in a slow walk to the stage.  Sun claimed the South Korean Tron community was growing, referring to on-chain metrics, and said local developers were focused on building games for the cheap and speedy Tron network.  He added that Asia was “right now the place to be if you’re in crypto,” especially Hong Kong, citing favorable government policies and the interest from developers and users.  Across several talks, founders at Hashed, one of Korea’s premier blockchain funds, said decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, needed to get much more sophisticated than the current cohort of products that allow users to swap tokens in turn of yield rewards. Ideas included creating better code for how DEX order books work to fill trades faster without the concerns of front-running.  Namada Protocol founder Awa Sun Yin announced a privacy mainnet that would let existing DeFi applications plug themselves into the new network easily to offer private transactions for their users.  Among NFT players, @FrankDeGods, creator of the popular DeGods NFT collection, stressed how NFT companies and communities should first take steps to retain current users – amid a more than 90% price slump of 2021’s darling collections – instead of trying to onboarding newer people.  At NFT side events, most developers and holders seemed upbeat about the prospects of these blockchain-based digital pictures in the coming years. An investor, who wished to remain anonymous, explained that future generations may want to show off popular NFT collections as a sign of affluence, instead of physical luxury items such as Rolex watches.  Elsewhere, Yoann Turpin of major market maker Wintermute said Asia’s relatively favorable regulations for crypto businesses and trading companies should foster growth, and therefore revenues, and could mean U.S. companies may have to shift there to enjoy that ride.  Back at the crypto booths, companies tried numerous novel ways to attract conference-goers. Some doled out chocolates, some put a cap inside a locked box to represent privacy, and some had K-Drama part-timers give out actual, physical tokens.  The longest line? For a soft-serve stall near a massive NFT mural. Priorities were in order.

His insights, which spanned from macroeconomic trends to the intricate dynamics of AI, culminated in a bullish prediction for Filecoin, a decentralized storage solution in the crypto domain. Why The Bitcoin And Crypto Bull Could Start Early 2024 Hayes began by dissecting the symbiotic relationship between debt, AI, and the intrinsic value of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Historically, he noted, crypto bull markets have been propelled either by fiat currency liquidity or by groundbreaking technological advancements. Related Reading: Tron’s Justin Sun Mulls Over Making A Move On FTX’s Crypto Stash, Here’s Why However, a simultaneous convergence of these two driving forces has been conspicuously absent. “Over the past decade, one of these two factors has always been the reason we’ve had a bull market in crypto. Yet, we haven’t witnessed a bull market where both were present at the same time,” Hayes remarked. Assuming that both factors could play out next year, Hayes ventured a bold prediction for the crypto sector’s trajectory. “I believe the next bull market in crypto could commence in early 2024. This could potentially be the most significant bull market not only for cryptocurrencies but also for risk assets since the eras of World War II and the Great Depression,” he stated. Diving deeper into global economic trends, Hayes highlighted the alarming acceleration of global debt, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. He presented a stark picture of the US public debt maturity profile, emphasizing the looming challenges. “What do governments resort to when faced with a mountain of debt that needs issuance, but there’s a dearth of willing buyers at feasible interest rates? The answer is simple: they print money,” Hayes elucidated. As the discussion transitioned to technology’s intersection with crypto, Hayes identified AI as the prevailing zeitgeist. Drawing parallels with past technological revolutions, he emphasized AI’s transformative potential within the crypto space. He cited the meteoric adoption of AI technologies, such as Chat GPT, and the burgeoning investments in AI-centric firms like NVIDIA as testament to this trend. Will Filecoin Rise From The Ashes? Hayes then meticulously connected the dots between AI’s demands and the indispensable role of decentralized storage in the crypto ecosystem. He posited that centralized storage solutions, while prevalent, pose significant risks, especially for burgeoning AI applications. “Why does AI, a dominant force in the crypto and tech sectors, necessitate decentralized storage? Relying on centralized solutions like Amazon means entrusting vast swathes of data to entities that can unilaterally alter terms, hike prices, or even shut down services, potentially under governmental directives,” Hayes explained. Related Reading: BREAKING: Crypto Exchange CoinEX Reportedly Hit By Massive Hack, Losses Exceed $27 Million This line of reasoning led Hayes to spotlight Filecoin, emphasizing its significance in the crypto landscape. Despite its dramatic price decline from its zenith, Hayes championed the untapped potential of Filecoin. “Filecoin’s value in the crypto space isn’t merely speculative. It’s down nearly 99% from its peak of $300 to $3 today. Yet, its tangible utility is evident, with real customers actively using the network and significant data being stored,” he detailed. Hayes further highlighted his investment in Seal Storage, a Filecoin storage platform. SEAL has undertaken a project named Atlas, associated with CERN, the renowned European particle accelerator. By leveraging SEAL, CERN aims to optimize data costs, and in return, SEAL garners rewards in Filecoin for hosting this data on the network. This synergy isn’t exclusive to CERN. The University of California, Berkeley, recognizing the potential, has integrated SEAL for analogous purposes. Furthermore, SEAL’s innovative approach has caught the attention of other prestigious institutions, leading to collaborative ventures with NASA and various esteemed universities across the United States.

42419620,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUF8Kz,1694590833,These 4 Charts on Households' Finances Explain Bitcoin's Lull,"The disposable income of U.S. households is depleting fast, according to key indicators tracked by investment banks.  Lower disposable income or money available after adjusting taxes means lower consumption and investment in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""2023 is boring,"" asset management firm Arca's Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman recently said, referring to the crypto market lull.  This is absolutely true. 2023 has been characterized by prolonged periods of low volatility in bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies and limited episodes of price turbulence, in stark contrast to the previous three years, when there was a dearth of sideways trading. Besides, bitcoin's year-to-date gain of over 50% has failed to spur activity, as evident by the steady downtrend in trading volumes and market depth.  Households' dwindling disposable income likely explains the situation, aside from regulatory hurdles and the absence of cheap liquidity that greased the start-up ecosystem in the past three years.  Risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies suffer when disposable income drops, with the latter being more sensitive, like the art market. A household's willingness to take risks in matters of investment and overall spending is inversely related to the level of disposable income or the money available after expenditure and taxes.  The following charts explain the worsening household finances.  Households' excess liquidity  The chart shows U.S. households' liquid holdings in billions of dollars, the historical trend in holdings adjusted for inflation and forecasts for liquid holdings.  The liquid holdings surged after the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020 and peaked sometime in early January 2022. Bitcoin rallied over six-fold to $69,000 in 18 months following the March 2020 crash and fell into a brutal bear market as liquid holdings peaked.  Per JPMorgan, the disposable income, which currently stands at $1.4 trillion, is being run down by around $100 billion per month and could be fully depleted by May 2024, meaning the highly-anticipated crypto bull market may remain elusive for some time. The Federal Reserve Beige Book released last week highlighted ""reports suggesting consumers may have exhausted their savings and are relying more on borrowing to support spending"".  Data tracked by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) show the U.S. led the percentage decline in household disposable income in major economies last year.  Consumer interest expense  The non-mortgage interest expense as a percentage of wages and salaries earned by U.S. households has surged from roughly 2.2% to over 4.2%, according to data tracked by BEA, GlobalData. TS Lombard.  Higher interest payments reduce disposable income, weighing over consumption and allocation to risk assets.  ""This level is now at its highest since the Great Financial Crisis and is in line with previous recessionary levels. Despite higher interest rates continuing to take their grip on the American economy and consumers, the market looks ahead to the distinct possibility of higher interest rates to come,"" Blockware Solutions said in a weekly note on Friday.  Delinquency rates  Delinquency rates on card card loans and consumer loans have jumped to the highest since 2012 and 2020, respectively, according to charting platform TradingView.  In other words, U.S. citizens are falling behind on their credit card and consumer loans. Per the latest data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the total credit card balance in the second quarter of this year was $1.3 trillion, the highest since the central bank began tracking the data in 1999.  The mounting pile of debt bills means less disposable income and low interest in investing in digital assets. Economic theory suggests that uninsurable income risk and the expectation of future borrowing constrains can reduce the share of risky assets in a household's portfolio, according to an article written by Luigi Guiso, Tullio Jappelli and Daniele Terlizzese in the American Economic Review.  Blame the Fed and inflation  Households' worsening financial health is not surprising, as higher interest rates and inflation mean consumers are paying inflated prices for basic needs and paying more to cover the cost of borrowing.  The Fed has raised rates by over 500 basis points since March 2022 and is likely to keep the benchmark borrowing cost elevated for longer. The central bank and its global peers poured trillions of dollars into the system after March 2020, triggering risk-taking in all corners of the financial market.  The data due Wednesday is expected to show that the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) jumped 0.6% in August, or triple the pace of July's 0.2%. On a year-over-year basis, the CPI is forecast to have grown 3.6% versus following July's 3.2%.  9:13 UTC: Adds a quote from the American Economic Review.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/13/these-4-charts-about-households-finances-explain-bitcoins-lull,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb5e3a50f0fd3f021d146ac7d5b9b27e86daea7c-1280x848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The project was picked up the following year by members of the community, who formed the TON Foundation in order to keep it alive.  Development of the spinoff network continued, shepherded by the Foundation and seemingly independent of Telegram, though the association between the two remained. Many of TON's most noteworthy developments used Telegram as their arena.  TON, however, will remain a ""completely separate decentralized organization,"" Hyman said in an interview.

17570394,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551082,1694588429,Beyond XRP Euphoria And $0.5 Resistance: Bulls’ Next Steps,"XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with the Ripple platform, has experienced a tumultuous ride in recent weeks. The price action of XRP showed that the bears were firmly in control, extinguishing the brief euphoria that followed Ripple’s legal triumph over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. At the pinnacle of Ripple’s legal victory, XRP surged above the $0.80 mark, a level unseen since April 2022. However, this jubilation was short-lived. The excitement fizzled out as XRP’s value nosedived, erasing its gains and plunging it back into bearish territory. The abrupt reversal raised questions about the sustainability of the crypto’s upward trajectory. Investors, once filled with hope, are now left wondering about the future of this once-promising token. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Bullish Run Falters: Time To Brace For A Price Dip? XRP Market Insights Paint A Grim Picture Popular crypto trader Benjamin Cowen pointed out on X that “XRP has retraced the entirety of the move that came after the SEC vs. Ripple case.” This statement underscores the market’s sentiment, suggesting that the legal triumph’s positive impact on XRP’s price was only temporary. $XRP has retraced the entirety of the move that came after the SEC vs. Ripple case. Narratives do not drive the market, liquidity does. pic.twitter.com/8295jFRdHB — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) September 11, 2023 As of now, XRP’s price hovers at $0.480443, according to CoinGecko, with a modest 2.0% gain over the past 24 hours. However, a more concerning statistic is the seven-day dip, which stands at nearly 5%. This decline reflects the current bearish sentiment surrounding the digital asset. Since early August, the 1-day chart for XRP has displayed a bearish market trend and a downward movement. Since bulls failed to break through last week’s $0.5 resistance, a revisit of that level could be a good opportunity for short sellers. Selling Pressure Evident A closer look at XRP’s on-chain metrics reveals that the selling pressure has been palpable. The On-Balance Volume (OBV), an indicator that tracks buying and selling volumes, has been in a downtrend alongside the price over the past month. XRP market cap currently at $25 billion. Chart: TradingView.com This suggests that sellers have been dominant in the market, while buyers have struggled to exert influence, especially in higher timeframes. This scenario further confirms the bearish grip on XRP. Another metric worth noting is the mean coin age, which measures the average age of coins being transacted on the network. The metric experienced a sharp decline on August 30 and September 1 but has since started to climb higher. Related Reading: Filecoin Uphill Battle To $3.5 – What’s Holding It Back?

In the proposal, FTX would still not have to issue advance public notice of transactions given their market-moving implications – as the prospect that a crypto player selling off as much as $100 million of assets per week has already chilled crypto prices.  The U.S. Trustee originally objected to FTX’s plan, saying that any intention to sell off bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) should be flagged as widely as possible to give others an opportunity to object. In its compromise, FTX has agreed to keep the U.S. Trustee privately in the loop, alongside committees representing the exchange’s creditors.  FTX will be hoping that is enough to placate opponents, with Judge John Dorsey set to consider the proposal at a hearing later Wednesday in a Delaware courtroom.

At the center of the case is Wright's compliance with a compulsion order that required him to complete a financial disclosure form by April 3, 2023. The form is a crucial step in judgment collection, necessitating a detailed account of the debtor's financial situation. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart found that an initial version of this form was incomplete, but a new version filed on July 24 complied with the order in a ruling dated Sept. 12.  ""At oral argument, Dr. Wright’s counsel conceded that the March 30 version of the Form omitted required information,” the document reads. “That version of the Form did not include (among other things) his employer’s address, any information about his spouse, and information about whether he had bank accounts.""  “He does not contend that he lacked the ability to comply with the Compulsion Order,"" the document continues.  W&K Info Defense also challenged the lack of disclosure about property in Wright’s native Australia, as well as bitcoin holdings.  “Wright … appears to be generating income from selling bitcoin,” the firm argues.  In the filing, Wright contends that the court orders do not require him to disclose bitcoin held on-chain, which Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart agreed with.  As a magistrate judge, he cannot hold a defendant in contempt of civil proceedings himself, but can ""certify the facts to a district judge."" In this case, Judge Reinhart certified that there was a period between March and July where Wright did not provide the information he was required to, referring the case to District Judge Sarah Bloom to review. He did not set a timeline for a possible court hearing before the district judge.  The court also denied W&K Info Defense’s request that a restraining order be placed on Wright’s assets, a $250,000 per day penalty, and attorney fees. However, Judge Reinhart gave the green light to “remedial civil contempt proceedings.”  CORRECTION (Sept. 14, 2023, 14:20 UTC): Clarifies that while Judge Reinhart certified facts suggesting civil contempt sanctions to a more senior judge, he did not impose any sanctions himself.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/13/craig-wrights-financial-disclosure-form-in-143m-court-case-was-incomplete,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/974ceac28848ad8d14567a04a9e16b486896ce77-1807x1016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17561685,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551026,1694574053,"XRP Could Gain By 2500% In 2024, Crypto Analyst Says","Prominent cryptocurrency XRP remains among the major talking points in crypto over the last few months. Following Ripple’s partial victory over the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July, analysts have continued to weigh in on XRP’s future, mostly predicting a bullish price trajectory for the altcoin. In the latest development, a crypto analyst, EGRAG CRYPTO on X, predicts that XRP could be set for massive gains in 2024 based on historical price data. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Reveals The Countries Topping The 75,000 Holder List XRP To Repeat Price Rally In 2024? According to an X post on September 12, EGRAG CRYPTO describes XRP as possessing “incredible potential.” Using data from the altcoin chart on Tradingview, the analyst projects a possible market gain of 2500% in 2024. EGRAG CRYPTO’s bullish prediction on XRP is based on the token’s price history. Between 2016 and 2018, XRP embarked on a strong bullish run upon forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, which appears again on the token’s monthly chart. For context, a symmetrical triangle chart pattern represents a period of consolidation that can result in either a price breakout or a breakdown. If the bullish prediction holds, the XRP token could experience a similar price breakout as in previous times. In line with EGRAG CRYPTO’s prediction, Sharon Thorp, a crypto analyst and business development executive at Wells Fargo, recently forecasted that XRP could trade at $500 in 2027. This prediction is based on the anticipated growth of the cross-border payment industry, which is expected to reach $250 trillion in valuation by 2027. However, while these predictions may encourage the XRP community, they are individual speculations and should not be considered financial advice. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Will Be By End Of Year Pain Before Gain? Although there may be a bullish sentiment towards XRP’s potential adoption in the coming years, some analysts believe the token could struggle in the remainder of 2023. According to a recent X post by a pro-XRP analyst, Jungle Inc 2.0, the rest of 2023 does not bode well for XRP or the general crypto market. The crypto analyst hinges this prediction on “tough financial times” marked by increasing interest rates by the US Federal Reserve. Furthermore, investors should remember that Ripple remains in court with the SEC. The US securities watchdog recently submitted a petition urging the court to approve its request to appeal the recent ruling in its case against Ripple. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $0.4805, dipping by 4.32% in the last week. Meanwhile, the altcoin remains the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap value of $25.46 billion.

17559493,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551035,1694570433,Curve (CRV) Trading Volume Plunge 97% In 2 Months,"Trading volumes associated with CRV, the governance token of Curve, a stablecoin decentralized exchange (DEX), is down 97% barely two months after it was hacked in late July 2023. According to Kaiko, CRV’s trading volume in centralized exchanges, especially Binance, where the token is actively traded, fell from nearly $300 million in late July to $7 million as of September 12. Trackers show that CRV is available for trading in multiple centralized and decentralized exchanges, including Binance, Uniswap, and Curve. However, considering the popularity and liquidity standing of Binance, most CRV trading was concentrated on the world’s popular crypto exchange. To illustrate, Binance’s share of CRV trading is about 20% when writing, while Bitbox is next with a dominance of around 7%. Curve’s TVL, Price, And Trading Volumes Collapse In crypto, a drop in trading volume often indicates waning interest in a digital asset or general caution practiced by investors. With falling volume, the asset’s liquidity takes a hit as traders or investors opt out, even liquidating the coin as they choose stability and refuge. Sometimes, they can adopt a wait-and-see approach, evaluating how the token will react in light of changing market conditions. Related Reading: Stake’s Hacker Moves $328,000 Worth Of Crypto From Stolen Funds According to DeFiLlama, Curve has a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $2.17 billion, down from $3.25 billion when the protocol was hacked. The decline in TVL and trading volumes comes amid the general lull in the decentralized finance (DeFi) scene. The drop in CRV valuation and trading volumes was worsened by the July exploit, which saw the protocol lose over $50 million worth of assets. Although Curve recovered most of those funds, the effect of the exploit called into question the general state of security. The Hack And Erogov’s CRV Disposal In the July hack, malicious actors exploited various Curve stablecoin pools using older versions of Vyper, a programming language used to create smart contracts on Ethereum. All Curve’s pools are automated, and this feature allowed hackers to drain multiple pools through a re-entrancy attack. CRV reacted to this hack by dropping, falling sharply on July 30 from around $0.74 to $0.48. It has since exceeded halved, crashing to $0.40, a new 2023 low. During this time, Curve’s CEO, Michael Egorov, had to sell CRV holdings he had used to back his loans via over-the-counter (OTC) to entities and individuals such as Justin Sun when prices started falling. Egorov had taken out loans on Aave and Frax Finance secured by CRV.

With a portfolio spanning various financial instruments, the company is now setting its sights on one of the most sought-after financial products in the digital currency realm: a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This development signifies the firm’s progressive stance on digital assets and underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Following the news, BTC has surged 4.2% in the past day, breaking above $26,000, as of this writing. Related Reading: GBTC’s Discount Narrows Amid Bitcoin’s Downturn, But A Bullish Trend Is Coming? Details Of The Franklin Spot BTC ETF Based on recent filings, the proposed offering has been dubbed the “Franklin Bitcoin ETF.” One of the fundamental characteristics of this ETF would be its primary assets—essentially constituted of Bitcoin. Coinbase Custody Trust Company, a subsidiary of one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange platforms, will serve as these assets’ custodians. Such a collaboration could provide the proposed fund an extra layer of credibility and security, given Coinbase’s longstanding reputation in the crypto space. Another critical aspect to consider is the chosen trading platform. If the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves, Franklin Templeton’s Bitcoin ETF will see its shares being traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange. In determining Bitcoin’s pricing, the filing indicates a reliance on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, specifically the New York Variant. Bitcoin Begins Rally After Bouncing Off $24,900 Following the Franklin Templeton spot Bitcoin ETF filing disclosure, Bitcoin has shown signs of recovery. The top crypto experienced a slight surge, breaking the downward trend that had dominated the market in recent weeks. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has surged by nearly 3%, trading for $26,185 as of this writing. Particularly, the asset broke away from the stagnant price zone of around $25,000 observed over the past week. Complementing its price movement, Bitcoin’s trading volume experienced a significant uptick. A comparison reveals that while the trading volume was as low as $1.7 billion last Wednesday, it increased to $18.4 billion in the past 24 hours. Notably, the financial industry’s anticipation for the first-ever spot crypto ETF is palpable. Franklin Templeton’s decision, while bold and promising, enters a domain where the SEC has shown consistent reticence.

17555038,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550970,1694563248,Bitcoin Sentiment Now Close To Extreme Fear: Why This Matters,"Data shows the Bitcoin market sentiment has worsened recently and is approaching extreme fear territory. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Plunged Inside The Fear Region Recently The “fear and greed index” is a Bitcoin indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors in the Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency market. This metric uses a numeric scale from zero to a hundred to represent this sentiment. When the index has a value greater than 54, the investors share greed. On the other hand, values under 46 imply the presence of fear in the market. The in-between region naturally suggests that the majority mentality is neutral currently. Here is what the Bitcoin fear and greed index looks like right now: The value of the index appears to be 30 at the moment | Source: Alternative As displayed above, the Bitcoin fear and greed index currently has a value of 30, meaning that most investors in the sector share a mentality of fear. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming Death Cross: Here’s What Happened Last Time Just yesterday, the indicator had a value of 40, implying that the sentiment has worsened quite a bit during the past day. Looks like the metric's value has sharply declined | Source: Alternative Besides the three core sentiments already discussed, there are also “extreme fear” and “extreme greed.” These two regions of the indicator have been pretty significant historically for the cryptocurrency. The reason is that extreme fear occurs at and under 25 when the major bottoms have formed for the asset’s price. Similarly, the tops have occurred in extreme greed (at and above 75). Bitcoin has generally tended to go against what most investors expect. The extreme regions are when this expectation is the strongest, hence why a reversal occurred. A trading technique called “contrarian investing” exploits this apparent pattern. Warren Buffet’s famous quote says, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” The current value of the index (30) is quite close to the extreme fear region, which means that if sentiment worsens further in the coming days, it might drop into this territory. Naturally, if such a drop happens, a contrarian investor might take it as a signal to buy the cryptocurrency.

According to this effect, BTC and other assets usually perform the best between 31 October and 1 May. Those who practice the “sell in May and go away” strategy come back this season to buy back into the asset. It remains to be seen how the Bitcoin sentiment will develop in the coming month and if the Halloween Effect will play any role. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $26,200, up 1% during the past week.
