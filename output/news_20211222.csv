42396286,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2SHE,1640215800,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Falls After Edging Toward $50K; Altcoins Rally,"(Edited by James Rubin)  Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin and ether’s prices moved little with Christmas only three days away; layer 1 and scaling system tokens rally.  Technician’s take (Editor’s note): Technician’s Take is taking a holiday hiatus. In its place, First Mover Asia is publishing the second in a series of stories on the year in cryptocurrency markets by CoinDesk markets analyst Damanick Dantes and Managing Editor of Markets Brad Keoun.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $49,008 +0.3%  Ether (ETH): $4,017 -0.06%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,696 +1%  DJIA: $35,753 +0.7%  Nasdaq: $15,521 +1.1%  Gold: $1,803 +0.7%  Market moves  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, remained around $49,000 during U.S. trading hours on Wednesday after a failed attempt to break through the key $50,000 threshold. At the time of publication, bitcoin was down slightly. Ether was also in the red but not far off where it began the day.  The small price movement on bitcoin and ether came with continued low trading volume across major centralized exchanges, according to data compiled by CoinDesk, as the market heads into the year-end holiday season.  Meanwhile, tokens associated with layer 1 protocols and scaling systems, including MATIC and LUNA, were market stars on Wednesday. The two coins have generated strong 30-day returns, despite a recent broader market sell-off.  MATIC’s price hit a record high earlier Wednesday, according to data from CoinGecko, after popular decentralized exchange Uniswap announced it launched on Polygon, a protocol that provides lower transaction costs compared with the Ethereum blockchain.  The recent rise of of these protocols comes as the growth of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum have paused, crypto research boutique firm Delphi Digital wrote in its newsletter on Wednesday.  Data compiled by Delphi Digital shows the number of smart contracts deployed each month has dropped significantly from earlier this year.  “The rising costs of deploying contracts has likely played a key role in pushing developers to alternatives networks,” Delphi Digital wrote. “Whether this can eventually pick up on Ethereum-centric layer 2s [companion systems] remains to be seen.”  End of year market wrap  Market Wrap Year-End Review: Musk Pumps Bitcoin and Dogecoin: Dogecoin pumped along with bitcoin thanks to some high-profile tweets. (by Damanick Dantes and Brad Keoun)  Hello, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021 we’re using this space to recap the year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, we’re recapping what shook crypto markets this year. (For the latest crypto prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)  On Monday, we recounted how even as bitcoin staged a powerful price rally to the start of the year, some institutional investors began to question the sustainability of the trend. Today, we’ll show how, during January and February, coordination and posts on social media fueled even more demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, delaying an immediate price correction.  As bitcoin (BTC) soared in February, social media, particularly Twitter, appeared to take on an expanded role in cryptocurrency markets, with prices pumping in response to tweet after tweet. It became clear that investor appetite for risk remained strong despite earlier concerns about rampant speculation.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk and then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted away to push bitcoin higher from $40,000 in January to nearly $57,000 in February. The viral effects of social media pushed retail traders into full-on buy mode, with bones thrown to the doggy-themed joke token dogecoin (DOGE) that added billions of dollars to that cryptocurrency’s market value.  On social media, some traders banded together in an effort to keep crypto prices elevated – similar to the way retail traders in traditional markets had coordinated to roil stocks like GameStop.  For example, Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world’s richest person, added the #Bitcoin hashtag to his Twitter profile, contributing to an immediate 11% BTC price rally. Shortly afterward, Jack Dorsey also added the #Bitcoin hashtag to his twitter profile.  The bitcoin endorsements by Musk and Dorsey went viral, inspiring a league of traders who dismissed the cautionary warnings of more experienced investors. It all seemed like a lot of fun. And bitcoin was not the only cryptocurrency to advance.  Musk also suggested in a tweet that dogecoin might be “the future currency of earth.” Musk’s involvement in the dog token tribe helped send DOGE mooooning (his word), along with other alternative cryptocurrencies.  Such hijinks kept the crypto party going. Here’s a look at relative performance in January; DOGE vastly outperformed bitcoin in January, as shown below:  How could one man cause such a massive move in crypto markets? CoinDesk’s Edward Oosterbaan explained earlier this month how Musk’s star power was able to sway the price of BTC and DOGE. (Spoiler alert: None of this is all that deep.)  “Musk is far from the only person to move the crypto market for no apparent reason other than making an endorsement,” Oosterbaan wrote. “A sizable portion of the industry from meme coins to NFTs has proven to be highly responsive to celebrity shilling.”  Oosterbaan continued: “High-profile celebrities and Twitter accounts sowing FOMO (fear of missing out) are likely here to stay. The power of social media in the crypto market is testament to the general lack of regulation and maturity, and the inherent liquidity of 24/7, permissionless assets.”  The chart below tracks Musk’s influence on the DOGE price over time, using data from TradingView.  During bitcoin’s swift ascent in January and February, retail traders used social media as a gateway to discover new alternative cryptocurrencies and react to market sentiment in real time.  In just a few tweets, Musk and other popular figures were able to pump and dump coins, leading to significant price gains and losses.  The lesson of this ever-so-bizarre stretch of crypto markets history is that social media was, and still is, a force that’s impossible for traders to ignore.

42396282,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2SEH,1640214047,NEAR Token Jumps Over 20% After UST Integration,"Tokens of Near (NEAR) jumped 23% to $10.80 on Wednesday after an integration with decentralized payments network Terra was announced by developers on Tuesday night.  Terra’s UST tokens – stablecoins whose value is algorithmically pegged on a one-to-one basis with the U.S. dollar – are now supported on the high-speed Near network, developers said in the announcement.  NEAR traded at $8.6 on Tuesday night before the announcement. Tokens have traded in a tight range of $8.5 and $9.5 before breaking the latter resistance level on Wednesday morning, according to trading data from CoinGecko.  Bringing Terra stablecoins to Near  Issuing UST on Near is a result of a partnership between Terra and decentralized finance (DeFi) tools NearPad and Rose. Developers say the move will facilitate the growth of UST to new ecosystems on both NEAR and Aurora, a bridge that moves assets between Ethereum and Near.  DeFi protocols rely on smart contracts instead of middlemen to provide financial services, such as lending, borrowing and trading, to users.  Terra has a growing user base and expanding to other blockchains helps create further use cases for both its blockchain and issued assets. On Tuesday, Terra became the world’s second-largest DeFi ecosystem and holds over $18 billion in value across various products and services, as reported.  NearPad and Rose will offer incentivized opportunities for users to deposit UST liquidity into the protocols, which can then be accessed by the wider NEAR community. NearPad is a Near-based decentralized exchange and market maker, while Rose is an Aurora-based stablecoin and wrapped assets swap product.  “Stablecoins like UST provide a simple interface to store value and interact with apps that need to use a stable unit of account,” Near co-founder Illia Polosukhin explained in a statement.  “Connecting NEAR and Terra ecosystems via Allbridge allows apps like Rose and NearPad to offer new ways to use stablecoins to both communities,” Polosukhin added.  In a separate development, UST became the world’s largest decentralized stablecoin on Tuesday with over $9 billion worth of coins in circulation. It is now supported on Ethereum, Terra, Binance Smart Chain and Secret network, as per CoinMarketCap.  Terra’s LUNA tokens have emerged as one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the past few months. They bumped 12% to over $95 on Wednesday morning, following a nearly month-long uptrend from the $41 level.

42396289,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2SID,1640208003,Market Wrap Year-End Review: Bitcoin Peaks as Coinbase Goes Public,"Hello, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021, we’re using this space to recap the year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight the key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, we’ll recap what shook crypto markets this year. (For the latest digital-asset prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)  In Tuesday’s episode, we documented the social-media craze that fueled price rallies in bitcoin and dogecoin in January and February. Today, we’ll show how Tesla’s involvement in bitcoin sent prices even higher in February and March. There was hype and ebullience leading up to the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase’s direct stock listing in April, but the rally quickly fizzled.  From Tesla to Coinbase, bitcoin went up, then down  The bitcoin price broke above $50,000 in February after Tesla disclosed it had invested $1.5 billion into BTC.  The market reaction inspired a bit of opportunism on the part of one enterprising T-shirt vendor, who rushed to offer a T-shirt for $19.99 with the words “Elon’s Candle,” referring to the electric vehicle maker’s billionaire CEO, Elon Musk. The “candle” referred to the dramatic pattern that appeared on bitcoin’s price chart as a result of the Musk-fueled price pop:  In March, Musk ratcheted up the drama with a tweet stating that consumers can “now buy a Tesla with bitcoin.”  The announcements helped propel bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, toward a previously unthinkable $1 trillion market capitalization for the first time.  But from a professional price chart reader’s perspective, bitcoin appeared to be “overbought;” that term meant the market’s run-up had probably gone too far, too fast and wasn’t justified by the underlying level of buying interest at the new, elevated threshold.  Once again, bitcoin turned lower – dropping back to its 50-day moving price average of around $30,000. Apparently, it was a level where buyers once again appeared to grow interested.  The market stabilization offered a signal to traders: Bitcoin appeared to hold above the price where it had started 2021, at $29,112. That was cause for renewed optimism.  So as news headlines in traditional financial media and breathless commentators began to highlight the upcoming direct stock listing of Coinbase, the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, the bitcoin rally resumed.  Over the coming months, the price would more than double, a reminder of just how volatile cryptocurrency markets can be.  Coinbase goes public  On April 14, Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, went live with its direct stock listing on the Nasdaq exchange, under the ticker symbol COIN.  “This is a watershed moment for the digital-asset industry, as it signifies a larger moment of credibility for a market that is maturing rapidly,” Hunter Merghart, head of U.S. for rival cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp, told CoinDesk in an interview.  The initial trading price for the COIN stock, at $381, was an impressive 52% above the reference price of $250 a share published a day earlier by the Nasdaq. But even that lofty price level was well below some of the price targets issued recently by stock analysts, with some estimates ranging as high as $600 a share.  The failure of COIN shares to push even higher suddenly seemed, well, deflating for a crypto market that had grown accustomed to prices constantly going higher.  By the end of the first day of trading, COIN’s stock price had dropped to $342.  The fading spirits spilled over into the bitcoin market: It turned out the hotly anticipated public trading debut of the cryptocurrency exchange wasn’t enough to sustain the twofold price rise in BTC over the prior couple of months.  Bitcoin stalled near an all-time high of around $64,800 on April 14 and quickly went into a sharp sell-off. The chart below shows slowing price momentum, defined by lower highs in the daily relative strength index (RSI), which typically precedes a decline in price.  The hotly anticipated COIN direct listing ended up being a classic “buy the rumor, sell the fact” event. In hindsight, the date of the Coinbase IPO would coincide with bitcoin’s top.  For seasoned crypto traders and newbies alike, the episode offered a fresh lesson in how even sky-high price predictions, euphoric rallies and milestones like the Coinbase direct stock listing do eventually come head to head with the reality of fickle and notoriously cryptocurrency markets, and down-to-earth valuations.

42396280,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2SCJ,1640205667,Teenage Suspect in $16M DeFi Hack Wanted for Arrest in Canada,"A Canadian teen math prodigy who allegedly swiped $16 million in an exploit of a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol in October swore on Twitter to “fight to the death” in a legal “duel” over whether or not he should be permitted to keep the funds.  Trouble is, he hasn’t shown up in court.  On Wednesday a warrant was issued for 19-year-old Andean “Andy” Medjedovic to appear before an Ontario court. The warrant comes following Medjedovic’s failure to appear at an in-person hearing on Tuesday, though people familiar with the matter say he appeared at a virtual hearing last Friday.  In October, Medjedovic allegedly used flash loans to drain funds from Indexed Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol offering index fund-style structured products. Following an investigation from a “war room” of industry experts, the affected team managed to uncover his identity.  Read more: After ‘Stealing’ $16M, This Teen Hacker Seems Intent on Testing ‘Code Is Law’ in the Courts  Unlike in other high-profile exploits where the attacker was “doxxed,” however, Medjedovic refused to return the funds and claimed on Twitter he was prepared to defend “code is law” – an unofficial DeFi ethos that holds that any activities technically permitted by smart contracts are not just immutable, but also legally and ethically permissible – in court.  In an interview with CoinDesk this week, Indexed core contributors Laurence Day and Dillon Kellar said the Tuesday hearing was in regards to a court-ordered freeze on the assets in question, also known as a Mareva injunction, and a receivership order, which would transfer the assets to a third-party custodian for the duration of legal proceedings.  According to Day, the Mareva injunction was filed to prevent Medjedovic from moving the pilfered crypto to Tornado Cash or a similar mixing service.  However, following his failure to appear, Medjedovic may now be making history as the first DeFi hacker to be actively pursued by law enforcement.  ‘Codeslaw’  A number of lawyers who spoke to CoinDesk in October said that Medjedovic’s “code is law” argument was unlikely to hold up under legal scrutiny.  To date, law enforcement has rarely gotten involved in hacks and exploits, in part because identifying culprits is near-impossible when attackers use the right tools to cover their tracks.  Read more: DeFi Has Accounted for Over 75% of Crypto Hacks in 2021  The sector is often compared to a financial “Wild West” where, in the absence of legal authorities and enforceable laws, self-regulation and the goodwill of “white hat” hackers are all that can help prevent exploits.  This legal void has led to a prevalent mindset that DeFi is effectively outside the reach of the legal system, and the only rules of the road are those encoded on-chain – “code is law,” often derisively referred to as “codeslaw.”  Day, however, argues that the hack was simple fraud. According to filings posted by Day and prepared in collaboration with the Canadian law firm Stockwoods, in addition to the Mareva injunction, Indexed developers are filing a class action suit arguing that the exploit was “civil fraud” and are seeking “rescission for misrepresentation or mistake, and/or unjust enrichment.”  Far from being a quirk in the code, Day and Kellar argue, the exploit relied on malicious intent and custom-built contracts that manipulated Indexed’s internal markets, creating the conditions that Medjedovic could exploit.  “The attack was not some simple accounting error waiting to misprice tokens – it had to be deliberately manipulated through a complex series of actions in order to create the circumstances under which assets could be taken at a below-market price,” said Kellar.  Legal precedent  A number of legal experts have expressed concern on social media that the looming case could inadvertently lead to an expansion of law enforcement powers, particularly in regards to fraud involving computers.  In a Twitter thread Wednesday, Day wrote that both he and Kellar are aware of the precedent that filing the suit could create and that they hired lawyers who would seek a resolution to the case they hoped would be “respectful” to the space in Stockwoods.  Kellar told CoinDesk that, despite the delays, battling out “code is law” in a court of law is ultimately just a matter of time.  “I think Andean will either get tired, show up to court and transfer the assets to the custodian, or be caught by the Canadian police,” he said. “Either way, we’ll all get our day in court and he’ll have a chance to make his defense.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/22/teenage-suspect-in-16m-defi-hack-wanted-for-arrest-in-canada,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04eb062a8dcba59231478c2185a2c4d413761f93-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396273,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2S5Q,1640199664,"Uniswap Launches on Polygon, Driving MATIC to All-Time Highs","Popular decentralized exchange Uniswap and Ethereum scaling system Polygon said Wednesday that all Uniswap version 3 contracts are now deployed to the Polygon mainnet.  The deployment comes a few days after UNI holders voted to pass a governance proposal approving the deployment. The price of MATIC and Uniswap’s UNI token were higher on the news, with MATIC, the native asset of the Polygon network, hitting a fresh all-time high of $2.66 earlier today.  “Ethereum introduced a noble vision of an open, borderless economic system accessible to everyone,” Mihailo Bjelic, co-founder of Polygon, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “With the increased usage, fees on Ethereum layer 1 have effectively ‘priced out’ most of the users.”  The Polygon version of Uniswap aims to change that, he added.  “With this deployment, Uniswap as the flagship Ethereum application returns back to the original vision and again offers low fees and open access to everyone,” Bjelic said.  As the largest DEX by trading volume, Uniswap is already deployed on two companion, or layer 2, systems, Arbitrum and Optimism. According to data from Defi Llama, about $62.19 million in value is locked on Uniswap on Arbitrum, while roughly $36.94 million worth of tokens are locked on the Optimism version.  Both numbers are much smaller than the total value locked (TVL) on the Ethereum mainnet version of Uniswap, a staggering $8.75 billion.  That said, Uniswap’s TVL lags behind Curve’s $22.23 billion, the biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol by that metric. Curve currently supports several blockchains and layer 2 systems including Avalanche, Harmony and Polygon.  Bjelic, the Polygon co-founder, told CoinDesk Uniswap will be hugely successful on Polygon, citing the network’s already successful DeFi ecosystem. Polygon is currently the No. 7 chain by TVL, per Defi Llama data.  A report by blockchain data firm Chainalysis earlier this year said DeFi is still dominated by experienced crypto traders and investors, partly due to the costly transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain. Scaling projects like Polygon have benefited from Ethereum’s congestion problem.  UPDATE (Dec. 22, 19:23 UTC): Changes headline to indicate fluid timing of tech launch.

Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Decline, But ETF And Other Instruments Enjoy Growth As per the latest report from Arcane Research, BTC exchange reserves have seen significant decline this year, but the growth in newer investment instruments like ETFs has made up for it. The &apos;exchange reserve&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin currently stored in wallets of all exchanges. Traditionally, this supply on exchanges has been considered the available trading supply of the coin. So, when the indicator&apos;s value moves up, it&apos;s taken as a bearish sign for the coin&apos;s price. On the other hand, a decrease may imply bullish trend. The trend with the exchange reserve has been that of constant decline since half a year now. Because of this &apos;supply shortage&apos;, many traders believe in a bullish outcome for Bitcoin in the long term.

Related Reading | TA: Bitcoin Gains Momentum, Why Rally Isn&apos;t Over Yet NewsBTC has been reporting on the possibility of a short squeeze for Bitcoin. The recent price action was most likely the result of the post-crash as the market needed time to form a range, and institutions de-risked their positions. Large players are now potentially sitting in big piles of cash and looking to front-run Bitcoin&apos;s next trend. This moved seems likely to come at the end of December due to the massive number of options that will expire right before the start of 2022. Investment firm QCP Capital is one of the defenders of the short squeeze thesis for BTC.

B.Protocol is one of the many money legos propping up the patchwork landscape of decentralized finance. Catering specifically to lenders in need of liquidating sour loans, it had roughly $87 million in total value locked as of press time, according to data website DeFi Llama.  Early-stage crypto fund 1kx led B.Protocol’s seed round; it is slated to ultimately receive 500,000 BPRO tokens. Other notable backers include Spartan Group and Robert Leshner’s Robot Ventures, with Dovey Wan’s Primitive Ventures chipping in a smaller sum.  They will receive their tokens over a four-year linear vesting period, according to Eitan Katchka, B.Protocol’s ecosystem development chief. That time frame is rather long but not unheard of in crypto investing, a handful of VCs told CoinDesk.  Building the preeminent liquidity backstop for decentralized finance (DeFi) lenders won’t happen overnight, B.Protocol’s Israel-based founders noted. Solving what Katchka described as a lingering pain-point in the crypto capital markets may still be worth it.  DeFi loans aren’t always fully collateralized, Katchka said. This can become a problem when crypto bets go south and liquidations needs to occur. That’s where B.Protocol’s pool of user-pitched “backstop liquidity” steps in.  “The backstoppers – the users who provide liquidity to the backstop – actually can earn some profits from liquidation, something which till now you had to be highly technical” to achieve, he said.  B.Protocol services decentralized borrowing protocol Liquity and Hundred Finance. It’s working on an integration with MakerDAO and Fuse, Katchka said.

The funding will be used to build products and add personnel, including in legal to help the company navigate the regulatory landscape, Arcade co-founder Gabe Frank told CoinDesk in an interview.  The round included noted crypto investor Pantera Capital, and other investors included Castle Island Ventures, Franklin Templeton, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince and Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma.  Arcade appraises, validates and curates NFT collections for institutions, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and wealthy collectors. Lenders gain access to a new income source and asset owners can achieve liquidity on their holdings, while retaining all rights and access to collateral on Arcade.  Arcade is fully compatible with all ERC-20 tokens, including wETH, USDC and DAI. The company’s Wrapped NFT technology allows multiple NFT assets to be bundled and utilized to acquire a single loan. Arcade is also an open-source DeFi primitive that allows developers to build on top of the platform.  Arcade’s Frank first entered the crypto space professionally in 2018, but he had long understood the power of fungible assets. HIs family owned a chain of pawn stores in Texas, which gave Frank insight into loans collateralized with non-fungible physical assets such as diamonds, watches and paintings.  “I started collecting NFTs and realized that there was an infrastructure gap in terms of getting liquidity on these assets,” said Frank. As market caps soared, he reasoned the same credit markets that popped up around physical assets would form around the non-fungible assets.  Arcade is coming out of a private release with $3.3 million in total loan volume secured on $10 million worth of assets on the Arcade platform.  “Arcade’s collateralization of this new asset class will incentivize the participation of new entities from both the traditional and digital art and finance worlds, including institutional lenders, high-net-worth individuals, DAOs, companies with NFTs on their balance sheets and NFT collectors and creators,” said Pantera Capital principal Lauren Stephanian in a press release.  As an increasing number of people own NFTs, there’s a growing demand for accompanying DeFi applications.

Hive, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, said it will mine more bitcoins in the quarter ending Dec. 31 than the 656 it produced in the previous quarter, mainly due to investments in expanding its operations.  It also expects to mine more than 6,900 ether, the native token of Ethereum, in the period. That’s a 21% drop from about 8,688 ether mined in the previous quarter.  The decline is due to average mining difficulty rising by over 16% compared with the prior quarter, including a peak level hit on Dec. 7, as more miners started production, the company said.  “This drop in the production of ether in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter will be offset partially by the average price of ether increasing by 45%, and the higher bitcoin mined in this quarter boosted by the increase in the price of bitcoin in the quarter of over 35%,” Hive said.  In fact, CoinDesk’s first ever year-end survey of crypto miners revealed that the increase in hashrate and difficulty is only expected to rise in 2022 as the industry becomes more competitive.

The Las Vegas-based infrastructure company is now “in the millions of users,” Vicuna said, after accounts ballooned 2,000% year over year. Its business-facing network of application programming interfaces (APIs) for know-your-customer (KYC) checks, trading, debit card issuance, retail settlement and crypto on- and off-ramps gets pinged 300 million times a month, he said.  With clients including FTX, Binance.US, Securitize, Dapper and Kraken, Prime Trust gets exposure to some of crypto’s hottest corners, everything from derivatives trading to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Businesses can pick and choose which APIs to plug into depending on their needs. Vicuna said it saves them time while increasing Prime Trust’s footprint in the fast-growing ecosystem.  “You can think of us as the best indicator of adoption within the market,” Vicuna said, “because we are so widely spread out across different segments via crypto exchanges-on ramps, wealth apps, lending platforms and more.”  Much of the action flows through in fiat. PrimeX, the company’s cash settlement layer, processed an average of $3.5 billion a month by the end of 2021. That’s up 40% from Prime Trust’s last reported totals.  The booming figures follow Prime Trust’s $64 million Series A in July. It’s since doubled headcount to “the couple hundreds” – Vicuna declined to provide specifics – and doubled-down on marketing after realizing “word of mouth” alone was not aggressive enough.  Read more: Prime Trust Raises $64M to Scale Fintech Infrastructure Biz  Compliance has been a key growth area, Vicuna said. Nearly half the company is dedicated to policing its business endeavors. They also “sell compliance as a service” to market players, alongside their other offerings.  As for the company’s own growth, Vicuna predicted a busy 2022. He cast doubt that this year’s massive influx of venture capital across the space could continue its breakneck pace through another 12 months and predicted the market “will return a little bit to fundamentals.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/22/this-behind-the-scenes-crypto-firm-saw-2000-account-growth-in-2021,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4c62432e0b12ca9252a8d3383d430f26de5e0c8-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396270,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2S0V,1640184480,Bitcoin Mining Profitability Starts Falling After Stellar Year: Research,"The profitability of mining bitcoin has been slipping since November after a very profitable few months, Arcane Research said Wednesday in its monthly report.  In the month following China’s crackdown on miners in May, the bitcoin hashrate – a measure of computing power on the network – almost halved, data from mining pool BTC.com shows. With less competition from Chinese miners and soaring bitcoin prices, the remaining miners saw returns steadily grow until November, Arcane’s data show.  Galaxy Digital’s head of mining Amanda Fabiano compared the period to a “gold rush” in an inteview with CoinDesk.  But between Nov. 9 and Dec. 22, cash flows from bitcoin mining using Bitmain’s Antminer S19 have decreased by 36%, Jaran Mellerud, a researcher at Norway-based Arcane, told CoinDesk. For the S9 they’ve dropped 50%, he said. Mellerud attributed the slide to “a 28% drop in the bitcoin price over the same period, coupled with a 12% increase in [mining] difficulty.”  The profitability of mining using S19s has fallen to levels last seen in July, according to Arcane’s data.  Mining difficulty has been increasing since the end of July, data from bitcoin explorer Blockchain.com show, as displaced Chinese miners found new locations for their operations and new investments came on line, particularly in North America.  The difficulty of mining a bitcoin block automatically adjusts based on the hashrate to keep the time necessary to mine a block stable.  The biggest publicly traded miners “have extremely many ASICs [application-specific integrated circuits] scheduled for delivery in 2022,” Mellerud said. Given these deliveries and the fact that Chinese miners are still plugging back in, the hashrate will likely continue to increase into next year, miners told CoinDesk.  That means the “super profits” that we saw in 2021 “will continue falling in the first months of 2022,” Mellerud said.  Some of the world’s biggest mining firms echoed Mellerud’s predictions in interviews with CoinDesk over the past few weeks. Most expect the hashrate to grow significantly and even double in the next year as more machines are deployed, such that the difficulty of mining will rise, and profit margins will narrow.  But profitability ultimately depends on the price of bitcoin, Mellerud said. If it “increases faster than all the new hashrate coming online in 2022, we might see periods in 2022 with similar super profits as in 2021,” he said.

Being in Opera’s native wallet lineup means users will have more seamless access to that realm.

The limited rollout will begin with its Android mobile user base. Two years ago Opera estimated that pool was around 80 million monthly active users.  But the door is open for a broader release to Opera’s full audience of 380 million, a figure from August. An Opera representative told CoinDesk through Polygon spokespeople that integrations “typically” begin with the Android app before branching out to iOS and desktop.  “This was also the development path for our crypto wallet,” the Opera spokesperson said.

Sun outbid around 2,600 people and paid $28 million for one seat on Bezos’ rocket ship back in June but couldn’t make the trip reportedly due to a scheduling conflict (he did not say what the conflict was). But according to an announcement made on Wednesday, through an agreement with Blue Origin, Sun will help select and pay for five additional crew members to join him on a launch in 2022.  Blue Origin is not disclosing the cost of a ticket to space. The “New Shepard,” Blue Origin’s suborbital rocket, with room for six astronauts, has successfully launched into space three times.  “Over the coming months, H.E. Mr. Sun will nominate five exceptional men and women to travel with him on his voyage,” the announcement said. The trip will last approximately 11 minutes.  This isn’t the first time Sun has won a high-priced auction. In 2019, Sun won a dinner with business magnate Warren Buffett, which he canceled because of kidney stones. He later made up the dinner with Buffett and a handful of other crypto entrepreneurs in early 2020.  Sun is launching a campaign titled “Sea of Stars” through which he plans to nominate the prospective crew members, according to the announcement. Each nominee will be an outstanding leader in his or her field, which can be anything from fashion to technology and space exploration to entrepreneurship. The announcement also said details on the nomination process and criteria will be announced in the coming months.  “Nominees may include a member of the TRON DAO community, comprising long-term holders of TRX, BTT, JST, SUN, NFT, and WIN,” the announcement said.  The last time Sun tried to pick winners from among TRX holders, he came under fire for allegedly botching the selection process. In 2019, Sun promised to give away a Tesla to a lucky Twitter follower that retweeted a post.  After an online selection process that was promised to be randomized, Sun said there was an error and promised the winner, one @uzgaroth, a free ticket to the 2020 Tron convention instead. Sun drew heat from the gesture, and later promised to give away two Teslas citing transparency: one to the original winner, and another to the final select, @LeoHuynhPro.  It is not clear if the winners received the promised Teslas.  Sun revealed last week that he was stepping down from actively managing the Tron foundation, and announced he is the new ambassador for the Grenada government to the World Trade Organization (WTO).  Sun’s going into outer space has no financial or commercial ties to the Tron Foundation because the funds will be coming out of his own pocket, a spokesperson for Sun said in an email to CoinDesk.  The spokesperson added that Blue Origin will be “serving as a trusted adviser on the space flight” but Sun will be making the final decision on the selection process.  At that point, Blue Origin will have final approval over who actually travels on its rocket ship.",NEUTRAL,TRX | BTT,BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRX | BTT,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/22/justin-sun-reveals-he-was-secret-28m-bidder-for-seat-on-bezos-spaceship,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Kintsugi is a “longer-lived, public testnet” that will allow application developers and users to become familiar with a post-merge Ethereum environment. Heavy usage of the test network will allow clients and Ethereum developers to find any potential issues and further mitigate issues during mainnet’s impending Merge.  This development is another huge step toward Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake, showing the significant progress core developers have made since announcing the Amorpha developer network just weeks ago.  Read more about Kintsugi here.  To all the readers of Valid Points, merry Christmas and happy holidays! We will be back next week with the full version of the newsletter.  Welcome to another issue of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  The supply of stablecoins grew 388% during 2021, fueled by decentralized finance (DeFi) and derivative products. BACKGROUND: After starting 2021 with a supply of $29 billion, the stablecoin market capitalization looks to end 2021 around $140 billion. New market participants utilized stablecoins to generate outsized yield in DeFi, purchase crypto assets and collateralize derivatives positions. While USDC and USDT remained in the top spots, MIM, FRAX and UST showed their potential as on-chain alternatives for their centralized counterparts.  Financial services giant Goldman Sachs released a research report highlighting blockchain technology’s potential in metaverse and Web 3 applications. BACKGROUND: The report noted blockchain’s ability to independently verify unique digital assets, without the need for a central authority. Goldman analysts believed that a partial elimination of centralized control could disrupt companies currently dependent on user identity.  Stablecoin supplier Fei Protocol and Rari Capital approved a protocol merger after weeks of governance discussion. BACKGROUND: The merger between Fei and Rari faced scrutiny from the Rari community, due to terms allegedly more favorable to Tribe holders. While the merger’s success was a big win for DeFi governance, certain aspects of the process highlighted issues with the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model, as governance can be shortsighted and slow to implement changes.

According to Chainalysis research, crypto adoption increased by more than 2300% in 2021 as compared to 880% in 2020. This adoption was mainly seen in developing nations of Asia, including Vietnam, India, and Pakistan, proving that crypto has been easily accessible to emerging and under-developed nations where banks have failed to create a suitable foundation. With easy internet access, crypto has expanded to every corner of the globe, thanks to its features like fast and cost-effective transactions, transparency, complete ownership of money, and strong privacy. The flippening of TradFi has begun with crypto reaching the ends of the world. Banks Fail to Reach Billions Banks have always been plagued by many challenges. One critical problem is that the majority of banks deliver services through intermediaries who demand high fees. For example, making a large purchase of a house, car, or land involves a lengthy procedure with several hoops to go through, including attorneys, notaries, and other professionals that cost an arm and a leg. Another issue is that banks are centralized, which means they are controlled by the authorities, raising the possibility of devaluation or theft.

42423994,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jkHh,1640173570,Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Is Sued for Allegedly Stealing Blockchain Startup’s Work,"Brian Armstrong, the CEO of publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase, allegedly stole the work of a blockchain accelerator under the guise of potentially making an investment in one of its projects.  Blockchain accelerator MouseBelt Labs filed a complaint in California’s supreme court Friday alleging that in June 2019 Armstrong offered to invest in Knowledgr – a platform used to distribute scientific papers with tokens offered as an incentive – so he could use confidential information for ResearchHub, a similar platform he was working on, and eliminate Knowledgr as a competitor.  According to the complaint, Armstrong offered financial backing to Knowledgr – in which MouseBelt was already investing – and the opportunity to list the tokens on Coinbase. The accelerator is alleging that Armstrong, Coinbase and related entities committed fraud, interfered with a contract and were unjustly enriched among other charges.  The company is seeking damages and other forms of relief as part of a jury trial.  MouseBelt also alleged that Armstrong contacted Knowledgr founder Patrick Joyce in late June 2019 offering to personally invest $50,000 for a 1% share with a view to Coinbase making a larger investment subject to due diligence. The $50,000 was wired to Knowledgr in mid-July.  It was, according to the complaint, Armstrong’s intent to “steal MouseBelt’s work for themselves, to not only eliminate a potential competitor but to obtain for ResearchHub the benefits of the financial, design and technical resources MouseBelt put into Knowledgr, thereby allowing ResearchHub to launch sooner at less cost a successful platform based entirely or substantially on MouseBelt’s work.”  According to the complaint, Armstrong promised Joyce a job if he contributed to ResearchHub while remaining the chief executive at Knowledgr, while misleading MouseBelt in the process.  During this time, MouseBelt alleges, Joyce used an algorithm originally intended for Knowledgr for ResearchHub instead.  “MouseBelt asked whether Joyce had recently been in touch with Armstrong or ResearchHub. Joyce stated that neither he nor anyone else at Knowledgr had been in touch with Armstrong during the previous four months. Joyce would later admit the truth, which was that Armstrong had asked Joyce to work on ResearchHub during that same four-month period and that Joyce actually had been doing so. Joyce’s omission of this information was a breach of Knowledgr’s agreements with MouseBelt and was done to conceal Joyce and Knowledgr’s inappropriate actions,” the lawsuit claimed.  “We believe the claims are entirely frivolous and we look forward to proving our case in court,” a Coinbase spokesperson said in an email to CoinDesk.

Derivatives giant CME launched the ether versions on Dec. 6, opening the door for traders of all sizes to hedge their exposure in the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain.  The new offering has seen 115,000 contracts change hands in the two weeks to Dec. 17, the exchange told CoinDesk in an email.  “Participation in our micro ether futures contract has grown rapidly since its launch two weeks ago, and we are encouraged by the strong customer adoption and support thus far,” CME Group’s Tim McCourt, global head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Products, said in a press release. “At 1/500th the size or our larger ether futures, this new, smaller contract allows traders of all sizes to better manage their ether price risk in an efficient, cost-effective way.”  Still, the response to micro ETH futures appears tepid compared with the early action in micro bitcoin futures listed on May 3. Those registered a trading volume of 224,151 contracts in the first two weeks, according to data provided by the exchange.  Both micro contracts are sized 1/10th of one BTC and one ETH, while standard contracts represent five BTC and 50 ETH and are widely considered a proxy for institutional participation.  Micro ETH futures’ slow start isn’t surprising, however, given the current dour market mood. Further, volumes usually dip ahead of the year-end holidays. When micro BTC contracts went live in early May, market sentiment was quite bullish, with bitcoin trading around $60,000.  Activity in micro ETH futures may pick up in coming months as focus shifts to Ethereum’s impending upgrade to the proof-of-stake mechanism, dubbed ETH 2.0, and ether gains notoriety as a deflationary asset.  “Ethereum net issuance continues to decline with only ~37K ETH issued in November,” Messari analyst Mason Nystrom said in a research note published on Dec. 7. “At this rate, if market demand continues, Ethereum may see its issuance become deflationary relatively soon. In fact, it’s possible that December might become the first month in which Ethereum experiences negative net issuance (deflation).”  Ethereum implemented the EIP-1559 upgrade on Aug. 5, introducing a mechanism to burn a portion of fees paid to miners.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) criticized two ads, one on Facebook and the other on the club’s website.  The Facebook post, which appeared on Aug. 12, said supporters who owned the AFC token could vote on which song the club would play in the event of a victory. The website page appeared on Aug. 6, claiming to explain “Everything you need to know” about the token.  According the ASA, both were irresponsible for trivializing investment in crypto assets and failing to illustrate the investment risk. The Facebook post was misleading because it did not make it clear the fan tokens were crypto assets that had to be bought with cryptocurrency.  Arsenal said the tokens differed from cryptocurrencies, which are a means of payment, because they were designed for entertainment and to encourage fan participation. The tokens could not, at the time the ads appeared, be traded on the Socios app. The club also denied the ads were for cryptocurrency investments.  Increased promotions for cryptocurrencies and assets has drawn the attention of the ASA. Earlier this month the regulator censured ads by industry participants including Coinbase and eToro, as well a promotion by pizza chain Papa John’s.

The step marked a move away from “meme coin” status and towards broader use cases for the floki inu token. “$20M worth of FLOKI were already deposited into Inverse Finance within the first hour,” Inverse Finance founder Nour Haridy wrote in a tweet.  Data from digital-wallet scanners show 364 billion floki inu tokens are locked up on the floki pool on Inverse Finance as of Wednesday morning. DeFi projects like Inverse Finance rely on smart contracts instead of centralized middlemen to offer financial services to crypto users, such as lending, borrowing and trading.  Inverse Finance allows users to get token loans by supplying tokens to the protocol as collateral. The newly launched floki pool has a collateral factor of 50% as of Wednesday, which means users can take 50% of the value of their staked floki inu tokens in the form of DOLA, a stablecoin issued by Inverse Finance pegged on a one-to-one basis with the U.S. dollar, or other tokens.  There is no expiration date on the loan. However, if floki inu tokens drop in value and a user’s borrow limit exceeds 100%, the loan is liquidated and a 13% fee is taken on top of repayment to the liquidators.  “This process is automated and cannot be stopped so please borrow responsibly and do not borrow the full limit,” a documenthttps://docs.inverse.finance/user-guides/anchor-lending-and-borrowing/floki-faq by Inverse Finance cautions.  The addition of floki inu comes after an onchain governance proposal was passed by the Inverse Finance community on Tuesday. Projects like Inverse Finance operate as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), relying on their community to propose newer ways of growth, adoption and other technical improvements.  However, the addition did little to budge floki inu prices. CoinGecko data show prices remain flat at $0.00012 after an initial spike on Tuesday night. Token prices are down 32% in the past 30 days, mirroring a fall in the broader crypto market.  The rise of floki inu  Named after Elon Musk’s pet dog Floki, floki inu is one of the many meme coins entrants that mushroomed in the crypto market this year. A “rug pull” scare plagued the project early on after the original developer went rogue and exited with hundreds of thousands of dollars by draining a liquidity pool.  But community admins kept the token going and invested their own funds to keep the token afloat. A “V2″ version was announced by early adopters who helped relaunch the project, this time with security mechanisms to prevent rug pulls in place. The project has since grown to a market capitalization of $1.2 billion – attracting criticism from the likes of the U.K.’s advertisement authorities for its incessant marketing on London’s public transport.  Floki inu is also working on contributions outside of the crypto market. Tweets by developers on Monday claimed the project will build schools in Guatemala, Nigeria and Laos in partnership with local government authorities and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).",POSITIVE,FLOKI,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | FLOKI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/22/floki-inu-deposits-on-inverse-finance-break-44m-within-hours,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2f3be2407e5fe24a20889b1305f6b0daadd98c16-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One such whale wallet purchased 4 trillion shiba inu’s for $134 million early on Tuesday, according to data from WhaleStats, which tracks data from the top 1,000 Ethereum wallets after excluding known exchange and project wallets.  That wallet now holds more than $144 million worth of shiba inu, which makes up for 26% of its portfolio holdings in Ethereum-based tokens. Metaverse tokens sandbox and GALA, which make up another $122 million of the wallet’s $500 million total value held in ERC-20 tokens, with the rest scattered between tether stablecoins and altcoins like MATIC, enjin and loopring.  The buying boosted prices from a weekly low of $0.000028 on Monday night to a weekly high of $0.000034 on Wednesday morning. Prices have since corrected, but are still up 4% in the past 24 hours. Shiba inu’s price have been in a continuous downtrend after reaching new highs in October, but have since bounced from a resistance-turned-support level of $0.000028.  Shiba inu, a self-styled dogecoin rival, was founded in mid-2020 when the broader crypto market was seeing an influx of meme projects and food-themed coins like yam tokens. SHIB was written off by many at the time as one of the many meme coin projects that seemingly appeared out of nowhere.  But that didn’t stop shiba inu from becoming one of the best performers for early investors.  Token prices skyrocketed 153,857,000% to a record high of $0.00008616 in October 2021 compared to the low of $0.000000000056 in November 2020, according to data from CoinGecko. Shiba inu even broke into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in October 2021, surpassing even dogecoin for a few hours at the time.  Moving shiba inu away from a meme coin play  Developers of the Shiba Inu protocol have attempted to move away from the predominantly meme coin narrative in 2020 to introduce new technical services in 2021, which has helped fuel community adoption and prices.  Early 2021 saw the launch of decentralized exchange ShibaSwap, bringing with it decentralized finance (DeFi) services such as staking and lending. DeFi refers to a financial system reliant on smart contracts instead of centralized middlemen that offers services like lending, trading and borrowing to users.  Then, in December 2021, the project’s pseudonymous founder Ryoshi said development for a Shiba Inu-centric metaverse called Oshiverse was in play, following the recent trend of metaverse projects and application in the broader crypto market. Oshiverse would be based on Shibarium, a layer 2 system built atop Ethereum for Shiba Inu, they added.",POSITIVE,SHIB,DOGE | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/22/shib-spikes-as-whales-add-to-existing-positions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f3689be7532b087f6d7cd1c46677b8f47f22054-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424015,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jkjh,1640159390,Terra’s LUNA Notches New Record High Above $90 Even as ‘Shorts’ Keep Piling,"There is an old saying on Wall Street: Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria.  LUNA, the native token of the smart contract blockchain Terra, has nearly doubled to record highs above $90 in December, extending a four-month winning trend and decoupling from the weak trend in other top coins.  Such stellar rallies often translate into euphoria – a situation characterized by risky directional bets and excess bullish leverage and usually observed at market tops. However, LUNA’s market shows no such signs, with derivatives data signaling investor caution.  “People appear to be shorting LUNA perpetual futures, as evidenced from rising open interest and persistent negative funding,” a person associated with Swiss-based crypto derivatives tracking platform Laevitas told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat.  Open interest represented by the amount of dollars locked in the perpetual futures contracts has doubled to $394 million since Dec. 15. Indeed, the metric does not tell us whether the market is skewed bearish or bullish. But when combined with the funding rates, it provides insights on what traders have been doing.  In LUNA’s case, funding rates have consistently stayed negative since Dec. 15, a sign that short position traders have been dominant and paying long traders.  Perpetuals are futures without expiry. Exchanges use the funding rate mechanism to ensure perpetuals are priced around the underlying asset’s market price. As discussed in the explainer, the funding rate is paid every eight hours.  According to Delphi Digital, negative funding rates across major exchanges signal the presence of delta-neutral traders – people who take multiple positions to neutralize delta exposure or directional bias.  “The price increase over the last few days was likely triggered by investors buying spot LUNA to lock up in the Astroport lockdrop, then hedging their position via perpetual futures to remain delta neutral,” analytics firm Delphi Digital said in a research note published Monday.  Astroport, a new decentralized exchange, went live on Dec. 14 with a lockdrop facility airdropping ASTRO tokens to users who lock up their liquidity in the protocol.  The lure of making free money via lockdrop seems to have drawn investors to Astroport, taking out LUNA supply from the market. According to data source DeFi Llama, the DEX has pulled in more than $1 billion into the Terra ecosystem. More than 50% of that figure consists of LUNA tokens.  In October, Terra announced the implementation of proposal 44 to burn 90 million tokens held in the community pool, taking a page out of Ethereum’s EIP-1559 upgrade that introduced the supposedly-deflationary ETH burn mechanism.
