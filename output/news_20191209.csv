42431252,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Blh,1575928806,"Telegram Investor Documents Say BNY Mellon, Credit Suisse Helped Process $1.7B ICO","UPDATE (Dec. 11, 19:00 UTC): A passage in this story was updated to clarify that none of the investors on a list Elysium provided to Telegram has confirmed buying into the token sale. Two of them denied doing so.      Telegram told investors it was using Wall Street megabanks BNY Mellon and Credit Suisse to move and store fiat currency raised in last year’s blockchain token sale, court filings show.       On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a proposed order with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to request the British High Court’s assistance in getting the testimony of Telegram’s former chief investment advisor, John Hyman.       It followed a similar filing on Friday from the SEC, which has accused Telegram of selling unregistered securities and is seeking to block the issuance of the Telegram Open Network (TON) project’s tokens.       Attached to the new document are Telegram messenger exchanges between Hyman and some of the investors who were negotiating the purchase of the tokens, known as grams, that would run on the TON blockchain.      During one such chat, Telegram employee Shyam Parekh explained to an investor how the funds were supposed to reach the company.       “We will receive the funds through BNY, which will forward the funds to CS (Schweiz) AG for final credit to Credit Suisse AG,” Parekh wrote, providing the international bank code for wiring money to Credit Suisse via the Swift network.       BNY Mellon and Credit Suisse declined to comment. It’s not clear from the filing whether the investors Parekh was communicating with used either bank to send funds to Telegram.       The banks' apparent involvement is notable since few financial institutions have been eager to work with cryptocurrency startups and projects, due to perceived reputational and compliance risks. However, Telegram was an established company before it embarked on the TON project.       Further, BNY Mellon and Credit Suisse have been dipping their toes into the shallow end of the crypto pool.       In April BNY partnered with Intercontinental Exchange’s bitcoin futures subsidiary Bakkt to set up “geographically-distributed” private key storage. Credit Suisse hosted a full-day symposium on digital assets at its New York office last month. Both banks are members of Fnality, the consortium building a “utility settlement coin.”    Investor allocations    Further details of Telegram’s $1.7 billion fundraise also became public thanks to the filing, such as investors’ names and the amounts they invested.       According to messages exchanged between Telegram employees and several U.S.-based investment funds, Kleiner Perkins, in particular, secured a $30 million confirmed allocation of grams; Lightspeed China, the regional arm of Lightspeed Ventures, invested $25 million; and FBG Capital put in $10 million.      A bunch of smaller investors were approved to get in via a California-based fund managed by Elysium Ventures, according to messages between Hyman and Nikolai Oreshkin, managing partner of Elysium.       The list of investors who wanted to buy into Telegram via Elysium, according to Oreshkin, includes tech celebrities such as Wordpress creator Matt Mullenweg, Foursquare co-founder Naveen Selvadurai, co-founder and CEO of Yelp Jeremy Stoppelman, True Ventures partner Om Malik, former TechCrunch co-editor-in-chief Alexia Bonatsos (who runs her Dream Machine fund), founder of the mobile commerce platform Karma Lee Linden and the Hong Kong fashion billionaire Silas Chou.       However, after this story was published, Selvadurai and Malik each contacted CoinDesk and said they had not invested in Telegram. CoinDesk has reached out to the others on the list and will update if we hear back.             Elysium’s fund agreed to invest $12 million in total, according to messages between the fund’s managing partner Nikolai Oreshkin and John Hyman.       Answering a question about “where’s all this $ coming from” to Telegram in another chat, Hyman said “big Russia, CIS bid, quite a lot in Israel and Pavel fan club.” Pavel Durov is Telegram’s secretive CEO; the Commonwealth of Independent State (CIS) is an association of former Soviet republics, including Russia.       On Friday, the SEC asked the court to request the help of the High Court of England and Wales to help obtain Hyman’s testimony and documents related to Telegram’s token pre-sale. The court has previously ordered the deposition of Telegram’s CEO Durov, vice president Ilya Perekopsky and investor relations officer Shyam Parekh       The court will hear the SEC and Telegram discuss whether gram is an unregistered security on Feb. 18-19.",NEUTRAL,TON,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TON | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/09/telegram-investor-documents-say-bny-mellon-credit-suisse-helped-process-17b-ico,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7e2433ca447c7d6027f8ac3a5db87dabd0c0f3f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431241,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1BPh,1575923448,BTSE Exchange Plans $50M Token Raise on Blockstream's Ethereum Rival Liquid,"BTSE, a Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange, is looking to raise $50 million in one of the first token offerings on the Liquid Network, the parallel system to bitcoin created by startup Blockstream.       BTSE is looking to sell 50 million tokens at $1 each. The target launch date is March 2020 and there will be a total supply of 200 million tokens, of which the company plans to eventually buy back and burn 100 million of the tokens in circulation, according to a pitch deck for the offering.       “Funds raised will be allocated toward user acquisition to increase overall platform revenue, platform development and liquidity, as well as expansion into lending, OTC and mining markets. The minimum investment size is $150,000 USD,” the deck says.      If successful, the offering could help put bitcoin sidechains back on the map as an alternative platform to ethereum for launching new crypto assets. With sidechains like Liquid and RSK, an asset can be locked up on the main bitcoin chain and then traded on the parallel network, and vice versa. This allows complex operations like smart-contract creation and token issuance to occur on the sidechain without gumming up the works for bitcoin proper.      The idea was in vogue mid-decade until the emergence of ethereum, which was designed specifically for such use cases, and became the go-to launching pad for initial coin offerings, security tokens, non-fungible collectibles and the like. But Liquid, launched in September 2018, has started to make inroads; last week, BTSE announced it was integrating Blockstream’s Liquid versions of bitcoin and the dollar-pegged token USDT.      ""The Liquid Network provides a reliable platform for token issuance that benefits from bitcoin’s stability and security characteristics,"" said Lina Seiche, global marketing director at BTSE. ""Issuing tokens on Liquid is further much less complicated than on ethereum, which mitigates the risk of smart contract bugs and makes exchange integrations easier as well.""      While BTSE's will be the first exchange token on Liquid, it is one of a handful of issuers and possibly the largest to pursue fundraising on the network. Others include gaming startup Pixelmatic (run by Samson Mow, Blockstream's CSO and Seiche's beau), which has been seeking to raise $16 million, and Puerto Rican financial institution Zenus Bank, which planned to do a private placement of securities.     Buyback plan    BTSE will use revenue streams derived from platform fees and its OTC desk, as well as a foray into crypto mining planned for early next year, to buy back the tokens until the end of 2021, the company said.       “Starting three months from token launch, we will use 30% of all revenue to buy back and burn tokens. BTSE will eventually destroy one-hundred million BTSE tokens, leaving one-hundred million remaining in circulation,” said BTSE’s slide deck.       The idea is that the scarcity of the token will encourage users to hold it; other incentives for token holders include lower fees, and higher rebates, BTSE said.       BTSE also plans to deploy mining operations hosted by Blockstream in February, billing it as a consistent revenue stream with expected returns of 30% a year.       All told, BTSE (perhaps somewhat optimistically) expects to see revenues of $2.7 million in 2019 growing to $103.5 million in 2020, and reaching $323.4 million in 2021.

42431256,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Bph,1575923400,New Mac Malware Hides in Memory and Masquerades as a Crypto App,"So-called ""fileless"" malware is infecting Mac OS machines by hiding in memory and never touching files or drives. The malware, masquerading as a piece of crypto trading software called UnionCryptoTrader.dmg, is suspected to be the work of the North Korean hacking group, Lazurus APT.      The malware infects Mac OS computers by injecting an executable file into the boot process, thereby hiding it from the user and rendering it difficult to remove. The executable then looks for various online payloads and runs them in memory, ensuring that anti-virus software could miss the malware after reboots and other OS events. Ultimately, there is very little for an anti-virus app to find as the payload changes over time and the malware has root privileges on infected machines.      The malware is based on AppleJeus by the Lazarus APT Group, a North Korean hacking outfit, and comes from a lineage of fileless Windows and Mac OS Trojans that masquerade as crypto trading apps.      The attackers created a legitimate-sounding crypto trading website called JMTTrading that offered a ""smart cryptocurrency arbitrage trading platform."" The website is currently live but doesn't seem to be delivering its malware payload anymore.      ""It seems reasonable to assume that Lazarus Group is sticking with its successful attack vector (of targeting employees of crypto-currency exchanges with trojanized trading applications) …for now!"" wrote Patrick Wardle on security site Objective-See.      According to security research service VirusTotal, only 19 of 72 Mac OS anti-virus apps can detect the malware.      The U.S. Treasury Department previously sanctioned North Korean hacking groups for attempting to steal cryptocurrencies via malware in an effort to pay for military equipment.      “Treasury is taking action against North Korean hacking groups that have been perpetrating cyber attacks to support illicit weapon and missile programs,” said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence in September. “We will continue to enforce existing U.S. and UN sanctions against North Korea and work with the international community to improve cybersecurity of financial networks.”      As reporter Dan Goodin notes, the malware will bring up multiple password requests before it infects your computer, ensuring that only users most in need of fake crypto software will be infected which is obviously cold comfort for those who clicked through and installed the new Trojan.

Group leader Bogdan Nicolescu and co-conspirator Radu Miclaus were sentenced to 20 and 18 years respectively after being found guilty on 21 different counts of wire fraud, money laundering aggravated identity theft and other crimes, a press release announced Friday. The gang was also accused of developing malware which mined bitcoin and monero using their host computers' processing power.      Tiberiu Danet, a third Bayrob Group member, pleaded guilty in Nov. 2018 to eight charges. His sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 8.      From its founding in 2007 to its members’ apprehension and eventual extradition in late 2016, the Bayrob Group, which operated out of Bucharest, Romania, ran a sprawling hacking and malware operation. They deployed trojan malware in seemingly mundane emails from well-known companies and groups, but when victims attempted to download attachments apparently from Norton, the IRS and Western Union, their computers instead became infected with the Bayrob botnet, according to an indictment.      The botnet allowed its Romanian handlers to steal $4 million total, prosecutors claimed.      The botnet also installed crypto mining software, according to the July 2016 indictment. And it was not discreet; the Bitcoin and Monero mining operation hogged hosts’ processing power.      “Once a bot was instructed to mine for cryptocurrency, much of its processing speed and power would be unavailable to its legitimate owner.”      Bayrob also scanned for and transferred ownership of victims’ crypto wallets, if they had one.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | XMR,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/09/cryptojacking-malware-devs-sentenced-to-20-years-in-prison,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd48062199a95c92b67a9a46a68c2914a3222ef5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At a hearing over Nvidia's motion to dismiss in Oakland, California, the firm said Friday that shareholders had ""cherry-picked"" some company statements in an attempt to show that it had not been transparent over how much of its sales were due to miners, while ignoring others.      The case comprises consolidated shareholder lawsuits first brought in December 2018, after its revenues dipped and stock slumped by 29 percent, Law360 reports.      The shareholders allege that Nvidia had not been clear that its gaming segment still included a good volume of miner revenue, even after it launched a dedicated mining card, the Crypto SKU. That was only acknowledged by Nvidia in August 2018 after gaming revenue slumped, they claim.      Nvidia's legal counsel – Patrick E. Gibbs of law firm Cooley LLP – said the investors' case was not valid as they had not provided any evidence that Nvidia had known about the facts as presented in the suit, and had also not shown any connection between the stock price losses and the allegations.      “There’s not a single piece of data,” said Gibbs.      The shareholders' legal representative argued in response that Nvidia had indicated that crypto-based revenue was low, but was actually so substantial that the company missed its expected earnings when cryptocurrency prices dropped and miner demand fell.      During the hearing, District Judge Haywood S. Gilliam Jr. queried Nvidia over the fact that a Morgan Stanley analyst and others had appeared surprised when Nvidia stated in November 2018 that it expected revenues to decline over 7 percent.      Gibbs responded that some analysts went by the incorrect assumption that demand for gaming cards is ""static."" He also argued that not all analysts responded with “same type of surprise” at the earnings forecast.

42431236,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1BFh,1575903912,Developer Flags Big-Money Loophole for Stealing All the ETH in MakerDAO,"What if there were a way to empty all the ETH held by the Maker protocol?      That's $300 million worth of crypto right now. That's a lot of money. Even if doing it caused the price to drop in half or even by two-thirds, it could still be well worth the attempt.      Micah Zoltu, an independent software developer who is also one of the co-authors of the original white paper for the decentralized prediction market Augur, published a blog post on Monday describing an attack on MakerDAO that, he argued, could empty all the ETH from the system. (Users lock ETH into the Maker protocol to generate loans of the dollar-pegged DAI stablecoin.)      The problem, Zoltu writes, is in how Maker is governed: “Some group of plutocrats can control how the system behaves.”      The attack would only be feasible for a few MKR whales if they wanted to act quickly. Zoltu said that 40,000 MKR would be enough if the attack had some sophistication. As of this writing, 48,400 MKR, based on the staking approach of the Maker voting system, could do it right away.      So somewhere between $20 million and $25 million in crypto would need to be deployed to do it. That's assuming a person could accumulate MKR in a way that didn't drive up the price, which is unlikely.      “It is worth noting that Maker Foundation could attack the system in this way right now if they wanted,” Zoltu writes. “What is worse, [venture capital firm] a16z has enough MKR on hand right now to execute the attack the patient way!”      Aside from an inside job by the parties most invested in seeing ethereum’s flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) application survive, accumulating enough MKR to carry out the attack may be a significant hurdle.      ""I feel like it'd at least double the price,"" Joey Krug, a partner at Pantera Capital who has been briefed on the vulnerability, said. ""You could probably get a lot of whales to sell to you OTC [over-the-counter] if you were paying double market.""      On the open market, the price would ""go bonkers, multiples of what it is now,"" Krug said.      That's only if the attacker had to start from zero MKR, though. So first let's get into the attack that Zoltu describes and then circle back to the Foundation's objections.      How it works    The Maker protocol is governed by the MKR token.      One million MKR has been minted, a sliver of that has been burned. The Maker Foundation still controls several hundred thousand, both in its treasury and in smart contracts that hold them in escrow.      One MKR sells for about $510 as of this writing. Daily turnover is quite variable but lately, there's been about $4 million to $10 million in MKR turning over daily.      Anyone who holds MKR can put up a proposal as a smart contract on the protocol, one that can change any number of parameters. Maker uses continuous governance so that provisions can be voted to change at any time.      This is especially important right now because the system just made a major upgrade, implementing multi-collateral DAI and the DAI savings rate. This new upgrade is a whole new version of the protocol, such that there are really two kinds of DAI now and users are being asked to convert their old DAI (now called SAI) to the new.      The new system institutes some important security changes, such as a delay on how long it takes for changes voted through to go into effect and an emergency shutdown provision.      The biggest weakness allowing Zoltu's attack is the fact that the current parameter for governance delay is zero seconds. That is, any governance provision that gets voted through goes into effect immediately.      This is something Wouter Kampmann, head of engineering at the Maker Foundation, said has been discussed in detail by the MakerDAO community, which has decided it is better to have zero delay for now while it determines which kinds of changes should be able to bypass the delay and which ones should still have a delay.      ""It's really a matter of finding that sweet spot there,"" Kampmann said.      As long as it's in place, though, Zoltu argues, the funds locked in MakerDAO are ""not safu.""      In a call with CoinDesk, Kampmann said it would not be as simple as saying that all the ETH currently held as collateral by MakerDAO could just be directly moved to a wallet controlled by the attacker.      ""The way permissionless, unstoppable code works is that there is certain business logic that determines the rules of how to interact with the contract – and these rules are unchangeable,"" Kampmann said.      Zoltu admits it would take cleverness and planning, but at this point, readers who remember the DAO hack may be experiencing familiar chills. Your threat tolerance may vary.      The attack described by Zoltu would also need to be fairly fast. Kampmann expects that the governance delay may well be increased sometime in the first quarter, possibly in January.      Though it's important to note that this decision is not up to him or foundation staff.    On the other hand    ""You cannot just ignore the economics of it,"" Kampmann said. ""The problem with the model that's set forth is really in the incentive model.""      There are a small number of whales that have enough MKR to execute this attack now, but they are extremely unlikely to do so. It would send shockwaves across ethereum and likely if they hold that much MKR, they would lose more in other assets than they would gain in stealing the ETH (which would likely drop in value too).      The best thing MKR holders who care about securing the protocol can do, according to Kampmann, is stake their MKR on votes. The more that's staked, the more expensive this attack will be, and there is a lot of MKR on the sidelines right now.      Krug, who is well acquainted with the crypto investor class, acknowledged that MKR whales are probably well-intentioned, but he also said, ""We can't assume it for sure.""      There are over 16,000 ETH addresses with some MKR, however. If a bunch of minor whales were able to collude without warning the MakerDAO community, they might be able to assemble enough tokens without causing price movements.      The Maker Foundation said this would be very unlikely based on what's known about MKR liquidity. That is, MKR just doesn't move around that much.      But Zoltu insists this is not safe enough. He said, ""They [the Maker Foundation] are operating under the assumption that there are no dark pools of liquidity available to attackers. This is, kind of by definition, something one cannot know.""",NEGATIVE,ETH | MKR | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MKR | TRADING | DAI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/09/developer-flags-big-money-loophole-for-stealing-all-the-eth-in-makerdao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0121e837c1ecbe4610aff70e6e7b230565b9e0ad-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431248,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1BXh,1575900433,"Bakkt Goes Live With Options, Cash-Settled Futures Products","Barely three months after launching its long-anticipated physically settled bitcoin futures product, the Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt has gone live with its bitcoin options and cash-settled futures contracts.      The New York Stock Exchange’s sister firm announced in a blog post Monday that it's using its physically settled bitcoin contracts as a benchmark to support the new products, which were both announced in recent weeks.      The blog post compared Intercontinental Exchange’s bitcoin ambitions to those of its Brent Crude Oil Futures. The company launched a number of swaps, options and futures contracts based on the crude oil product, and hopes to follow “a similar playbook” to grow its bitcoin-related products.      “By starting with the physically delivered Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Monthly Futures, we have a benchmark contract which provides the foundation for us to develop complementary products based on the needs of our customers,” the blog post said.      While Bakkt’s physical futures contract saw a slow start after it was launched in late September, volume has recently picked up, with the monthly futures product trading more than $120 million three months in.      Bakkt’s options contract comes just a month before CME, which already offers cash-settled bitcoin futures in the U.S., launches its own similar product. However, while Bakkt’s pricing will be based around its existing physical product, CME’s is dependent on its bitcoin index.      Malta-based OKEx also announced Monday that it would offer options trading later this month.      Bakkt’s monthly options contract has no exposure to spot markets, the firm said.      The cash futures, offered through ICE Futures Singapore, seemingly takes aim at potential demand in Asian markets, though any ICE customer can trade the contract.

According to the Paraná state government, civil police in the state raided an unnamed organization in Sao Paulo, Curitiba and other regional cities last Thursday, claiming the group promised as many as 5,000 victims that they could produce sky-high returns on bitcoin investments.      Scammers targeted their network of victims through social media. After the victims sent funds, the suspects told them to wait as their investments grew three to four percent daily. But victims were not allowed to withdraw, the police alleged, and their money disappeared.      The four-month investigation culminated Thursday when police filed charges of fraud, money laundering, criminal association and forgery against the group. They arrested nine individuals in a SWAT operation that involved 50 officers, 20 vehicles and a helicopter.      Previously, Brazilian government officials have used bitcoin for illicit purposes too. In 2018, police busted a $22 million operation that siphoned funds from a prison budget and laundered them through the cryptocurrency.      The country’s government is no fan of bitcoin – whether used criminally or not.

42431230,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN183h,1575894600,The Safello Story: Smaller Crypto Exchanges Must Partner to Survive,"In the dog-eat-dog world of cryptocurrency exchanges, smaller startups that don’t attract the volume of megaliths like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken must band together to survive turbulent market cycles.      The Swedish cryptocurrency exchange Safello, founded in 2013, is one such startup. According to CEO Frank Schuil, the company went from processing roughly 500 orders a month in August 2018 to 14,000 monthly orders in October 2019 by partnering with a variety of wallets, including BlueWallet and Edge, as well as the bitcoin-friendly browser Opera. This included a widget that let European users with a bank identity number bypass the lengthy onboarding process.      “We want to do one thing really well, which is to take away the hard parts of our market. Right now we’re basically an on- and off-ramp,” Schuil said. “We want to expand on hyperlocalization to help us and our partners see better conversion rates.”      Likewise, Edge founder Paul Puey said the industry reminds him of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the ‘90s. He said he expects a shakeout in 2020, as more companies succumb to market volatility and risky business models. He expects exchanges to become more akin to infrastructure providers for mass users, rather than front-end products.      “Some of the early companies that had the most visibility were literally the ISPs,” he said. “But they suffered from a few common challenges, like [exchanges] today. They were super regional. They couldn’t scale globally. They had a heavy regulatory burden.”      Edge, a San Diego-based startup originally found in 2013 as Airbitz, has partnered with the incumbent Israeli exchange Bits of Gold, the lightning-friendly brokerage Moonpay and several other startups. From the users’ perspective, they may not even need to create an exchange account or enter personal information for small purchases, depending on the jurisdiction. Puey is one of the rare Californian entrepreneurs who has paid his staff in bitcoin for years, now encompassing a team of 12.      Both Edge and Safello have each raised nearly $3 million in venture capital so far and opted not to seek larger raises like Coinbase did during the 2017-2018 market cycle.      “If we want to build the best business we can be, we need to learn how to be profitable in a bear market,” Schuil said.      BlueWallet co-founder Nuno Coelho agreed, adding: “Our point of view is that the ecosystem is still too early to try to go too big. There’s still a lot of infrastructure that needs to be built.”      Coelho said his wallet startup noticed an increased percentage of downloads from European bitcoiners since integrating with Safello this autumn. Meanwhile, his team is already busy working on an integration with BTCPay Server, an open source payment processing project, and a partnership with Hodl Hodl.      From Puey’s point of view, such startup models allow teams to build out a “broader product” despite limited engineering resources. According to their founders, both Edge and Safello were profitable in 2019. BlueWallet, a much younger company, is bootstrapping and currently seeking its first funding round.      “A company that tries to do all-in-one will fundamentally have a poorer product, just like AOL when they tried to do everything from ecommerce to actual ISP connectivity to being the browser. That product eventually failed,” Puey said. “So I think partnerships are the way to go in any new industry.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/09/the-safello-story-smaller-crypto-exchanges-must-partner-to-survive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bff6bf1c82a96c74006df01008ff2f646ad70d26-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The same cross was last observed in May 2016, according to Bitstamp data.      A golden cross occurs when a short-term moving average breaks above a long-term moving average on a specific time frame (daily, weekly, monthly) and is considered an advanced warning of an impending bull run.      MA crossovers are lagging indicators and merely confirm the prevailing trend, however. As such, they have limited predictive powers, as discussed last week.      That said, crossovers are widely followed indicators and attract a significant amount of buying if the broader market conditions are supportive, as seen below.    Weekly chart    As can be seen (above left), bitcoin rallied more than 150 percent from $198 to $502 in the 11 weeks to Nov. 8, 2015, and then consolidated largely in the range of $360 to $470 before beginning the next leg higher with the confirmation of the crossover in May 2016.      The cross likely attracted buyers, as the preceding structure was positive – higher low and consolidation.      Further, the bull cross happened three months ahead of the reward halving (supply cut by miners), which took place in August 2016. By June 20, bitcoin had rallied by more than 120 percent to highs above $775.      The latest bull cross (above right) comes five months ahead of the next reward halving, due in May 2020. However, many experts, including Jason A. Williams, co-founder and partner of Morgan Creek Digital, believe the halving has been discussed extensively throughout the year and has been priced in.      Also, the preceding market structure is bearish: the cryptocurrency is trapped in a four-month falling channel and the bull cross is mainly the result of the sharp rally from $4,000 to $13,880 seen from April to June.      All in all, adopting a strong bullish stance on the back of the golden crossover could prove costly.      The case for a stronger upside move would strengthen once prices find acceptance above $7,870 (Nov. 29 high). At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,470 on Bitstamp.    Daily chart    Bitcoin violated the falling trendline resistance on Dec. 4. So far, however, that has failed to invite buyers in numbers.  A UTC close above the Nov. 29 high of $7,870 is needed to invalidate the lower-highs set up and confirm a bullish reversal. That will likely yield a quick move higher to $8,500–$8,672 (61.8 percent retracement of the drop from $10,350 to $6,511).      On the downside, key support is located at $7,087. A violation there would validate the bearish inverted hammer created on Dec. 4 and would likely yield a drop to recent lows near $6,500.    Weekly chart    Having faced rejection at the descending (bearish) 5-week MA at $7,561 during the Asian trading hours today, the cryptocurrency risks falling to support at $7,087.      The outlook as per the weekly chart would turn bullish if and when the four-month falling channel is breached to the higher side. That would imply a continuation of the rally from lows near $4,000 that started in early April.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/09/bitcoin-charts-first-weekly-golden-cross-in-35-years,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be99ce3ad60d6e4fd4f87609192927444c8fd6d5-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As reportedhttp://yuanchuang.caijing.com.cn/2019/1209/4631892.shtml by Chinese financial news source Caijing on Monday, the central bank is ""expected"" to launch the tests of the fully digital yuan in Shenzhen and Suzhou. Other places may also see trials.    The tests are likely to include the participation of state-owned partners. These comprise the ""Big Four"" commercial banks – the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China – and three telcos, China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom.      The pilots will see the digital currency, dubbed digital currency electronic payment (DCEP), applied in real-world scenarios such as transportation, education and healthcare, Caijing says. Partner banks will be able to design their own trials scenarios for DCEP.      The first of two pilot phases will be smaller scale and start at the end of 2019. The second, later in 2020, will be a larger-scale effort in Shenzhen, according to the report. If all goes well, a full launch of DCEP is expected soon after the pilots.      The central bank has been hastening its efforts to develop DCEP in part due to the announcement of the Facebook-led Libra project in June. Libra would most likely be a stablecoin pegged to a basket of fiat currencies and government bonds, although other options may be on the table.      According to Caijing, DCEP would have some similarities to Libra, though the technical details are not spelled out. The report cites a PBoC official as having said that the digital currency is designed to replace physical cash in circulation (M0 in banking terminology), and will meet ""the needs of portability and anonymity.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/09/chinas-central-bank-likely-to-pilot-digital-currency-in-cities-of-shenzhen-and-suzhou-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/731779ef4bb2676760fcc8e468441d075765b61d-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431226,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN17th,1575882013,Stellar's Version of Bitcoin's Lightning Torch Has Been Burning Quietly Since June,"The Stellar blockchain has been running its own version of bitcoin's Lightning Torch since the summer.      Early in 2019 a bitcoin community member known only by a pseudonymous handle, @hodlonaut, launched an experiment known as the Lightning Torch or Lightning Trust Chain. The idea was to test the lightning protocol, a second-layer scaling solution on bitcoin that makes it less expensive to send money (the experiment ended on April 10 as a donation to Bitcoin Venezuela).      Meanwhile, since June 26, Stellar quietly has been passing around its own version of the torch as a simple demo of how easy it is to move money around on the base layer of the blockchain created by Jed McCaleb.      ""I wanted something to bring the community together,"" Wouter Arkink, the Stellar torch's instigator, told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""There's a lot of people building, but you need something that is fun and connecting at the same time.""      The torch is currently 1150 XLM, or about $67. Unlike the lightning torch, Arkink says that participants don't always add the same amount to the torch (lightning users typically added 10,000 satoshis, much less than a dollar). It can be anywhere from two to 50 XLM.      We first encountered Arkink at the first Stellar conference, Meridan, in Mexico City. He initiated the torch and the website, enlisting some help from other community members once he got going. He met many former torch wielders for the first time at the event.      ""They said it connected the community, which is nice, because that was the goal,"" he said.      Arkink works as an innovation manager at a company in the Netherlands called Asito, but the torch was a personal project.      Lisa Nestor, director of partnerships at the Stellar Development Foundation, recently passed the torch herself. She told CoinDesk in an email: ""It's fun and something that has brought many of our community members together, which we really value.""    Keybase is key    The Stellar community has adopted the end-to-end encryption suite of apps called Keybase in much the same way that the rest of crypto uses Telegram, in part because the Stellar Development Foundation has been airdropping XLM on the app.      All torch participants need to use Keybase, but one unique advantage it offers is that a user can send something to someone on the app even if they aren't using it yet.      For example, a Stellar user might have a friend who is on Twitter but not on Keybase. The Keybase user could send the Stellar torch to that person's Twitter account. Keybase will create a wallet for that handle and wait for the owner to claim it (it charges 2 XLM to do so – roughly a penny, as an anti-spam measure, Arkink explained).      The whole idea of the Stellar torch (like lightning's) is to send it to people who want to receive it first, but Keybase makes it a little easier to bring people in. If two Twitter friends want to pass the torch but the receiver doesn't have a stellar wallet, Keybase provides a solution.      When the torch gets passed, users post their coordinates in the memo field. This helps the experiment's website track the torch as it traipses around the world. All the hops are shown on an animated infographic. The site currently lists 77 torchbearers.      So far, the website estimates that almost 500,000 kilometers have been covered – and it still hasn't reached a penny in total transaction fees.    Challenges    The Stellar torch doesn't have a pre-defined goal for ending, and it's going beyond just passing the torch around.      Arkink and his collaborators have introduced the idea of challenges. The first challenge is allowing a user to ""claim"" a country by being the first person to send the torch to someone in that nation. There are still lots of countries left up for grabs; a holder just needs to know someone they trust in a new geography.      A new meme has taken off where users make videos to commemorate their passing of the torch. Here's one with a ninja vibe and another that's a little more on X-Men side.      The torch's most ambitious challenge to date is getting the torch into the hands of famous people.      ""I think that will be very interesting because that's when you have to send it at some point to people who are less familiar with blockchain or cryptocurrency,"" Arkink said.      ""Probably the first one will be Kevin Bacon,"" Arkink said, aspirationally, due to the ""six degrees of Kevin Bacon"" game from the early days of the internet.      Nonetheless, the Stellar torch burns on quietly, the way things on Stellar tend to do.      ""Bitcoin gets a lot more attention than Stellar. Stellar in general is not marketing itself as much,"" Arkink admitted. But he likes that facet of the community's culture.      ""I like that it's just realizing real things and not gloating about things that might be there in the future,"" he said.      Correction (Dec. 9, 16:35 UTC): A previous version of this story referred to Stellar as a proof-of-stake blockchain.

42374506,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWva06r,1575851884,A Bitcoin Wallet Is Orbiting the Earth at 5 Miles Per Second,"CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA – At exactly 12:29 EST on Thursday, a crypto wallet built by developers at SpaceChain hurtled into the stratosphere aboard a Falcon 9 rocket.  When it arrived at the International Space Station, the 1kg node – only a fraction of SpaceX CRS-19 resupply mission's 2,600kg payload – became the first active bitcoin node on the ISS.  For SpaceChain, the launch is a step forward in its mission of building out a robust, decentralized blockchain infrastructure high above the Earth. The wallet will be beyond any country’s jurisdiction – and well above the reach of any physical hardware hacks.  SpaceChain sees its nodes as a radical new way to make crypto transactions more secure. This is the three-year-old company’s third launch and its first from American soil. The other two launches blasted off from China.  The wallet will play a small but important part in that long-term goal, said to Zee Zheng, SpaceChain’s CEO and co-founder. Once the astronauts aboard the ISS install it, the node will operate for about a year securing multi-signature transactions through the ISS data feed.  We met with Zheng over margaritas at a Mexican joint overlooking the famed Floridian Space Coast. More than half of his team had congregated in Florida to watch the launch. He was ecstatic.  This launch had been the 23-person company’s full-time focus for much of 2019 and it was a milestone they’ve been shooting for since they first proposed it 18 months ago.  “We put all the company’s resources into it,” said Zheng. SpaceChain declined to state how much payload space and research and development cost. They contracted through Nanoracks, whose CEO Jeffrey Manber is also a SpaceChain advisor.  It is fundamentally different from the other two nodes SpaceChain has put into orbit.  “For us, it’s kind of tricky,” said Zheng. “There’s no existing space-tested hardware available, so even to install our own software we needed to make major changes.”  Building a space wallet was one thing; making it compliant for use on the ISS was something completely different. SpaceChain’s open-source protocol had to be vetted by NASA and retrofitted for the station’s unique plug architecture, Zheng said  Zheng said that having Jeff Garzik as SpaceChain’s Chief Technical Officer helped in that regard. Garzik was one of the early bitcoin core developers and he led SpaceChain’s effort to build out the software soon to be integrated with the ISS. He’s also been thinking about blockchain in space even before SpaceChain founded, said Zheng.  “About five years ago in the bitcointalk forum, Jeff wrote an article about bitcoin in space,” said Zheng. “It’s been his dream for a while.”  This launch is a far cry from their first space project: a Raspberry Pi equipped with a Qtum node that the company launched from China’s Gobi desert in February 2018.  Their second launch, also from China, was slightly more developed. That hardware could run blockchain dapps on the SpaceChain OS and it communicated directly with the ground.  This new wallet will operate independently of SpaceChain’s past launches. It will not communicate with the previous nodes and all comms will route through the ISS feed to ground. This means the device will have a slower connection and it will take hours, not minutes for any single transaction to complete.  “We actually want to make slower,” said Zheng, who described this crawling pace as a feature, not a bug.  “We see so many crypto exchanges get hacked. And within two minutes the funds – millions of dollars – get transferred. By utilizing this channel we can not only secure transactions,” but have a chance to intercept suspicious activity, he said.  This could appeal to high-dollar clients – custodial services, exchanges, and enterprise customers, said Zheng, who are more than willing to trade a few extra hours for added peace of mind.  The node will live alongside a number of other experiments sent up to the ISS including Anheuser Busch's study of how sugars malt in space and an experiment to test of the effects microgravity has on genetically modified super-mice.  Only a few months ago it received a 60,000 euro grant from the European Space Agency. Zheng said the exposure that comes with NASA and SpaceX will help it grow to the larger mission.  But he insists SpaceChain is rocket agnostic. It's willing to contract with any agency, anywhere, whenever the time is right. NASA and SpaceX happened to be the ideal partners for the Dec. 5 launch, just as Chinese partners were for their first two. Future launches won't necessarily be.  ""Actually, next March we're going to use an Indian rocket,"" said Zheng, referring to one of the two SpaceChain launches he says is coming in the next 18 months.  In 10 years, perhaps, SpaceChain will deploy a network of dedicated satellites that “speak to each other” and run far more blockchain infrastructure than any single ISS wallet ever could, said Zheng. Until then, Zheng said he and SpaceChain will continue to rally toward its orbital goal.  “We’re welcoming anyone to join the revolution,” he said.
