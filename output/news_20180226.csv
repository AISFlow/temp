42380374,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NN8L,1519686056,Hacker Returns $26 Million in Ether Months After ICO Theft,"A hacker who stole more than 43,000 ether tokens from would-be investors in CoinDash has returned a majority of the funds to the startup.  The company reported that the thief returned 30,000 tokens over two different transactions, the first in September 2017 and the second last Friday, to CoinDash’s wallet. At press time, the tokens were worth a little more than $26 million.  The thief still has some 13,400 tokens ($11.6 million) after the second transaction.  The hack was first reported in mid-July 2017, when the hacker managed to compromise CoinDash’s fundraising site, swapping its ethereum address with another one. Users believed they were purchasing tokens and supporting the project, but more than 2,000 of them actually funded the hacker, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  At the time, the stolen ether tokens were worth roughly $10.3 million.  Investors who unwittingly donated to the hacker still received CoinDash’s CDT token, though anyone who donated after the project’s website was shut down did not. At least one user reportedly sent 50 ethers to the compromised address after it was shut down.  Despite the theft of its funds last year, CoinDash intends to launch its first product on Feb. 27, according to its website. This product will be a social trading platform, which CoinDash states will be integrated with several cryptocurrency exchanges, including Poloniex, Bittrex and Binance.

42380364,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NMzX,1519682417,50 Cent Says He 'Never Owned' Bitcoin in New Court Filing,"Performance artist 50 Cent Jackson may not be a bitcoin millionaire after all.  The American rapper, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, stated in a bankruptcy court filing obtained by The Blast that he ""has never owned, and does not now own, a bitcoin account or any bitcoin,"" and nor have his businesses. The filing was submitted on Feb. 23.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Jackson accepted bitcoin as payment for his 2014 'Animal Ambition' album, and according to a January report from entertainment news site TMZ, garnered about 700 BTC, which was worth roughly $8 million when TMZ's story was published. At the time, Jackson appeared to confirm the news on Instagram, writing, ""Not bad for a kid from the South Side, I'm so proud of me.""  He said further in a comment thread that he had forgotten that he had the bitcoin. The post has since been removed from his account.  Jackson claims in the newly-filed court documents that a third-party company handled the bitcoin transactions and that they were immediately converted to U.S. dollars.  Based on print-outs from Jackson's BitPay account that were included in the filing, TechCrunch estimates the total bitcoin payments received for the album to be much lower than the figure initially reported by TMZ, suggesting Jackson reaped around 6 or 7 BTC, not 700 BTC.  The performance artist and entrepreneur claimed in the documents that he did not dispute TMZ's report because he stood to benefit from the publicity.  ""As a general matter, so long as a press story is not irreparably damaging to my image or brand, I usually do not feel the need to publicly deny the reporting,"" Jackson wrote. ""This is particularly true when I feel the press report in question is favorable to my image or brand, even if that report is based on a misunderstanding of the facts or contains outright falsehoods.""  As for his previous comments on ""forgetting"" his bitcoin holdings, Jackson stated:  ""I made social media posts stating that 'I forgot I did that' because I had in fact forgotten I was one of the first recording artists to accept bitcoin for online transactions.""

42380375,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NN9b,1519678826,Bitcoin Pizza Day 2: How A Lightning Payment Made History,"What's your favorite food? The crypto industry seems to be partial to pizza.  At least that's the case today, with the industry celebrating (with some nostalgia) the first Lightning Network transaction used in the purchase of the Italian food favorite, one made by none other than the man who made bitcoin's first major purchase – Laszlo Hanyecz.  If that name doesn't immediately ring a bell, the transaction that made him famous will – on May 22, 2010, Hanyecz traded 10,000 bitcoins ($41 at the time) for two Papa John's pizzas.  The transaction went viral then and is legendary today, namely because bitcoin's price has increased so much that those bitcoins would be worth a whopping $100 million. But it is also heralded as the first bitcoin transaction in which someone bought something from a mainstream merchant, a couple years before the push for merchants to accept bitcoin began.  In that way, Hanyecz was seen as a bitcoin maverick, and now, he's made himself known again by purchasing pizza with bitcoin's in-progress (and still dangerous to use) off-chain Lightning Network, what many enthusiasts see as the cryptocurrency's liberator from its scaling and payments constraints.  ""Good people, harken and know that on this day the one called Laszlo did buyeth the first Bitcoin Lightning Pizzas, bringing us into this new era of glory and cheesy goodness,"" blockchain researcher Brian Lockhart wrote on the Lightning mailing list.  And on Reddit, a user commented: ""This dude Laszlo has nerves of steel and should be in the first batch of Mars colonists.""  For Hanyecz, though, it's not about a dish or his daring, it's about making sure the vision of bitcoin as a cheaper, faster, altogether better online payment system fulfilled.  ""On my [2010] pizza transaction, I paid a fee of 1 BTC, and it just didn't matter then because I was happy to get anything with it. I was spending this internet money to purchase a real good,"" Hanyecz told CoinDesk, adding:  ""I came out to post about lightning because I do believe in it. And it's still in its very early stages, but the lightning network promises to bring back that functionality of being able to buy pizza with bitcoin.""  More pizza please  Like Hanyecz's 2010 purchase, this most recent one may be only a small blip today, but its symbolic value could prove just as far-reaching. For one, it says much about bitcoin's technical direction, and the recent debates over this roadmap.  For those new to the industry, bitcoin's scaling debate was (and in some sense, remains) an exhausting ordeal, one that has pitted different parts of the community against each other.  On one side have been those insisting transactions fees were growing too high for businesses, necessitating an immediate change to the software. On the other, advocates for slow and steady changes that would encourage optimizations and the use of new network layers.  While all sides seemingly wanted the same thing, each had their own urgency and ideas about how that vision might be reached.  In the end, bitcoin's open-source developer team introduced Segregated Witness, a code change meant to impact scalability, and a competing cryptocurrency bitcoin cash broke away, showing off an 8 MB block size.  And all that started a new era of competing cryptocurrencies birthed from hard forks.  ""A lot of the reasons that these altcoins got a big push this past year is that people have started seeing you know bitcoin, it can't process every transaction in the world, we need something better, and all these people came out of the woodwork promising something better,"" Hanyecz said.  But he remains very skeptical that any of these new coins are worth a slice.  ""All these things that are supposed to be better, they're just kind of a copy and paste for the most part; they're not solving the problem,"" he said.  He continues, lamenting what he sees as salacious cash grabs between forks and initial coin offerings (ICOs), and firmly planting his stake in the ground as a bitcoin maximalist of sorts.  And with that, Hanyecz is very much interested in seeing the Lightning Network – which Bitcoin Core developers have been working on for years – to resuscitate bitcoin as a payment mechanism.  ""You know it's not some new thing that somebody came out with to try to sell their coins, you know. It's not like they're issuing coins and getting rich off them, like these ICOs or whatever,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""This is a completely different thing and I could stand behind it because you know, I'm using it, I bought a pizza with it.""  Slightly undercooked  Yet, even though Lightning development is nearing completion, issues – the biggest of which is the network's usability as detailed by Hanyecz's recent purchase – remain.  For one, because lightning relies on what is called a bi-directional payment channel, Hanyecz had to employ the services of a middle man.  With a bi-directional payment channel, both parties – the consumer and the merchant – would need to set up the payment channel in order to accept lightning payments. Because the pizza place Hanyecz was ordering from did not have the ability to set up a Lightning payment channel, Hanyecz paid a friend who set up the channel to facilitate the transaction.  So, like the 2010 transaction, where Hanyecz paid pizza seller Jeremy Sturdivant to make the pizza purchase, Hanyecz paid a friend who was also running a lightning node to purchase pizza's for him in dollars.  While using a middlemen isn't technically the point, the transaction ""demonstrates the basic premise of how this works for everyday transactions,"" Hanyecz said.  Still, there were a couple other tricky technical hindrances (one that will likely need to be worked out before lightning is used widely) – Hanyecz had to prepay for his pizza, and needed to prove he'd made the transaction in a simple way, without any kind of invoice.  ""I didn't want to prepay and end up with no pizza,"" Hanyecz said.  As an easy workaround, the pizza delivery driver was given the first few characters of the hex string, the transaction's unique payment identifier, and told not to hand the pizza over unless Hanyecz gave him that code.  Once the pizza arrived, Hanyecz flashed a piece of paper with the code, ""7241-a8c1,"" and the pizza was handed over.  In response, Lightning mailing list regular Robert Olsson wrote that in the future this process could be facilitated with an escrow service of some kind, and urged the mailing list: ""Start your brains, guys! Things are getting serious, there is pizza at stake!""  Seeing how far bitcoin has come since Hanyecz's first crypto-for-crust purchase, he doesn't believe the challenges interfacing with lightning will persist for long.  ""I'm thinking that people will figure that stuff out pretty quickly, and they'll provide ways of doing it automatically so that people don't have to think about it,"" he said, concluding:  ""The software takes care of it for you.""

42380357,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NMoD,1519677073,'Satoshi' Craig Wright Is Being Sued for $10 Billion,"Craig Wright, the nChain chief scientist who previously claimed to be the pseudonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, is being sued for a whopping $10 billion.  The lawsuit is being brought by Ira Kleiman on behalf of the estate of his brother, Dave, who has been linked to the earliest days of bitcoin. Kleiman, a forensic computer investigator and author, passed away in 2013 following a battle with MRSA.  Kleiman's role in the development of bitcoin came to light amid the controversy from late 2015, when Wright – an Australian businessman and academic – was identified by Gizmodo and Wired as the possible identity behind Nakamoto, who departed the project in 2010.  The bitcoin community responded mostly with skepticism regarding the claims, with some alleging that the proof offered by Wright was bogus. Wright later said that he would offer no additional proof to back the claim, and in the years since he has worked as the chief scientist for startup nChain and aligned with Bitcoin Cash, the breakaway cryptocurrency that launched last summer.  At the heart of the new lawsuit, according to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on Feb. 14, is an alleged hoard of more than 1.1 million bitcoins, which Ira Kleiman's lawyers say is worth in excess of $10 billion. He is being represented by Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, a well-known law firm that has been involved in high-profile court cases like Bush v. Gore, which followed the 2000 presidential election.  Wright, court records show, has been accused of allegedly conducting ""a scheme against Dave's estate to seize Dave's bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property associated with the Bitcoin technology.""  ""As part of this plan, Craig forged a series of contracts that purported to transfer Dave's assets to Craig and/or companies controlled by him. Craig backdated these contracts and forged Dave's signature on them,"" attorneys for the plaintiff wrote.  Included alongside the complaint are a number of additional filings, including the business registration for a firm called W&K Info Defense Research LLC, in which Kleiman and Wright were business partners.  In addition to the roughly 1.1 million bitcoins, Ira Kleiman is also seeking compensation for the intellectual property his lawyers claim arose from the partnership between his deceased brother and Wright.  ""...Plaintiff demands judgment against Defendant for the value of the wrongfully retained Bitcoin and IP, together with court costs, interest, and any other relief this Court deems just and proper,"" the complaint states.  Wright issued a one-word comment on Twitter when asked about the lawsuit.    Greed        — Dr Craig S Wright (@ProfFaustus) February 26, 2018      Notably, the complaint doesn't seek to assert whether Wright is the person behind the Nakamoto identity, stating that ""it is unclear whether Craig, Dave and/or both created Bitcoin"" (though at least one observer says that the issue could ultimately come before the court if the suit progresses).  ""For reasons not yet completely clear, they chose to keep their involvement in Bitcoin hidden from most of their family and friends. It is undeniable, however, that Craig and Dave were involved in Bitcoin from its inception and that they both accumulated a vast wealth of bitcoins from 2009 through 2013,"" it goes on to say.

CULedger is a nationwide consortium, having begun ""in 2016 as an endeavor between CUNA, Mountain West Credit Union Association, and Best Innovation Group to develop a concept for a credit union system-wide permissioned distributed ledger platform,"" according to the press release.  It's been working with Evernym, which created the Sovrin protocol, since at least last year. Evernym is one of a number of startups seeking to use distributed ledger technology to create ""self-sovereign"" identities fully under users' control.  The release of MyCUID appears to be the latest move in the consortium's efforts to change how credit unions handle personal data, after forming a credit union service organization last year.

In remarks made after the event, European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis suggested that the bloc's leadership may pursue additional oversight, though he said such an outcome ""depends very much on the facts and circumstance around specific crypto-tokens"" and that more work will be performed by the Commission on this front.  He told reporters:  ""This depends very much on the facts and circumstances around specific crypto-tokens. Based on the assessment of risks and opportunities and the suitability of the existing regulatory framework for these instruments, the Commission will determine if regulatory action at EU level is required.""  By contrast, Dombrovskis struck what appeared to be a positive tone about initial coin offerings (ICOs) while also acknowledging the risk for those investing in some of the blockchain projects which conduct token sales.  ""[ICOs] have become a way for innovative firms in this field to raise substantial amounts of funding,"" he was quoted as saying. ""This is an opportunity, but there are also problems that expose investors to substantial risk, such as the lack of transparency regarding the identity of the issuers and underlying business plans.""  The vice president noted that a relatively small amount of cryptocurrency trading occurs within the EU and that, as a result, Europe needs to work with other G20 nations to address these possible risks.  In a way, he echoed a call by officials from France and Germany, two G20 members who said cryptocurrencies could ""pose a substantial risk for investors"" in a letter earlier this month.

42380369,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NN23,1519668039,Bitcoin Core Releases Software Upgrade With Full SegWit Support,"The Bitcoin Core development team has released a much-anticipated software upgrade designed to help scale the cryptocurrency network.  Version 0.16.0 of Bitcoin Core, the standard software client of the bitcoin network, adds full support for Segregated Witness (SegWit). Its release was presaged by a Github announcement earlier in February.  ""Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 introduces full support for segwit in the wallet and user interfaces,"" said a statement circulated Monday on a Linux Foundation mailing list.  The code is intended to solve bitcoin's scalability obstacles. Bitcoin's main protocol has a maximum block size of 1 megabyte, which restricts the volume and speed of transactions.  By separating signature and transactional data, SegWit reduces the ""weight"" of transactions, which creates more room in any given block. This does not increase the network's block size limit, but it does increase the volume of possible transactions.  The removal of the signature information also resolves the problem of transaction malleability, which was previously a security vulnerability because transaction IDs could be altered. Likewise, this impeded the implementation of second-layer protocols such as the Lightning Network.  SegWit also introduces a new address format created by Bitcoin Core contributors Pieter Wuille and Greg Maxwell that provides a better user experience, facilitates the automatic support of SegWit and lowers transaction fees.  Introduced in November of 2016, SegWit has seen slow adoption amid the controversy over the block size limit.  Major crypto exchanges have recently moved to support SegWit, including GDAX and Bitfinex, however.  ""SegWit provides not only an immediate benefit for users, but also a foundation for future bitcoin development,"" Bitfinex said in a Medium post. ""By supporting SegWit addresses, Bitfinex is tackling three of the biggest crypto-enthusiast concerns: transaction fees, transaction speed, and total network capacity.""

In a way, the disclosure echoes one published last week by Bank of America, which warned at the time that it faces both competitive and compliance risks as a result of the technology.  According to the Feb. 26 filing, which constitutes its annual report for the fiscal year 2017, Goldman believes that it might be impacted because of its work with clients and the companies it has invested in. Goldman is an investor in payments startup Circle (which announced today that it had acquired crypto exchange Poloniex) and is one of a number of investment banks that offers its customers access to bitcoin futures markets, as reported by Bloomberg earlier this year.  The company wrote:  ""We may be, or may become, exposed to risks related to distributed ledger technology through our facilitation of clients' activities involving financial products linked to distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain or cryptocurrencies, our investments in companies that seek to develop platforms based on distributed ledger technology, and the use of distributed ledger technology by third-party vendors, clients, counterparties, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries.""  While no obvious connection was drawn, the risks highlighted – particularly on the cryptocurrency front – may form part of the reason why Goldman has thus far eschewed any closer involvement in the market.  In January, CEO Lloyd Blankfein denied a past report that the investment bank was eyeing the launch of a dedicated trading desk for bitcoin (though he did leave the door open for such a move at a later date).  ""We're a prime broker and so if our clients are going to do it, we're going to do it. A principal bitcoin business where we're going long and short, market making, so far we're not,"" he said at the time.

42380362,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NMuV,1519653617,W3C Vets Forego ICO for Government-Friendly Blockchain Launch,"""Greed brings attention to things,"" Manu Sporny says.  He's thought about this for some time, brainstorming the pros and cons of an immensely popular, yet flagrantly hyped new mechanism for raising money – the initial coin offering (ICO).  So, today, Sporny and his team at Digital Bazaar, a successful software provider 15 years in the making, are launching the Veres One identity blockchain without its own token.  The project isn't ready for general availability just yet, but is being released for testing and tweaking (should bugs be found in the code).  However, what seems most notable, especially in today's frothy crypto ecosystem of multimillion-dollar token raises, is that Digital Bazaar's identity blockchain does not need an ICO, it does not need a token.  ""Our goal is not attention seeking, it's trying to build the most cost-effective infrastructure for this thing,"" Sporny said.  And that infrastructure needs to clean up the mess that is digital identity today, where large, powerful gatekeepers control the system and keep silos of data that have proven vulnerable to data breaches. Not only that, but an identity blockchain needs to be a global public utility that everyone – even the poorest of the poor in developing nations – can benefit from.  Yet, how could that dream come to fruition if the platform's token is being pumped and dumped and speculated on rampantly every day, in turn making the fees to operate and use the network unpredictable?  As such, the Digital Bazaar team designed Veres One as a public, permissionless distributed ledger where three groups of stakeholders work together to keep the system running: nodes that run that software, maintainers that develop the software continually and a diverse (both gender-wise, ethnically, culturally and geographically) board of governors that sets the operational rules of the network that maintainers then execute on.  All these groups will provide checks and balances on each other, according to Sporny.  Without a token, the blockchain will subsist on fees for users – currently set for users at around $1 and anticipated to stay low, since Digital Bazaar won't start in debt with its investors, Sporny said.  He continued:  ""A project that does do a token sale versus one that doesn't do a token sale, all things being equal … the one that doesn't do a token sale will fundamentally be a more cost-effective solution since it doesn't have investors to pay back. So, the cost of the network can be much lower.""  Downsides of being different  That's not to say Sporny doesn't see a place for crypto tokens and ICOs anywhere.  If a network was going to generate billions of dollars in value, he said, it could successfully implement a token. With identity as the business, though, he doesn't see that happening. And he's OK with that.  Sporny told CoinDesk:  ""We're not optimizing for the ICO frenzy, we're optimizing for the long haul.""  Although, Sporny said, Digital Bazaar almost did hold an ICO. The team hired lawyers and started designing a token, but a couple of months into writing the white paper, they decided it made no sense, he said.  ""The problem is that if you have a competitor that comes in without an ICO, they'll be able to do things much more cost-effectively,"" said Sporny.  Not everyone agrees.  Drummond Reed, the chief trust officer of Evernym, another blockchain identity provider, has raised private equity, but is also planning a token sale in the future.  ""We believe the best answer is a balance of both,"" Reed told CoinDesk. ""All equity, which is the conventional route, is both slower and more dilutive than tokens. However, [just doing a token] goes too far the other way – it doesn't lay a solid foundation for a company as a business.""  He continued, speaking to the trend in the crypto space today, saying:  ""Tokens are here to stay as a powerful new way to offer incentives and support value exchange in a blockchain-based network. So ignoring tokens altogether is not, in my honest opinion, wise.""  With money in the bank from the work Digital Bazaar has provided and continues to provide for clients, the company didn't need to raise another round. It's used that money to build the infrastructure already.  Although, Sporny acknowledges that, without a token, the platform might not garner as much attention as some of the other projects in the cryptocurrency space. Yet, with the crypto space hinting at the first signs of ICO exhaustion, according to several investors CoinDesk has spoke with, it's not guaranteed a token will even lure that much enthusiasm anyway.  Plus, token sales generate the ""wrong kind of attention"" for Veres One, said Sporny. According to him, the project needs to entice decision makers such as government agencies and international non-profits, instead of western investors.  The 'right' interest  Digital Bazaar has been successful in that area already.  The firm was given grants by the Department of Homeland Security twice – both times for its work building a fit-for-purpose blockchain for digital identity.  Evernym also received a grant from the U.S. government agency.  According to Sporny, this work with the Department of Homeland Security was how some of the Veres One blockchain was built and why it's designed the way it is.  Decision makers and government agencies (the grants not only gave them access to U.S. stakeholders, but internationally too) want a system that is ""simple, predictable and the cheapest thing out there,"" he said.  ""Frankly, doing an ICO is a mark against anything that will potentially be used in government,"" Sporny continued, adding:  ""It's not a hard and fast rule, but it makes people skeptical of the project that there might be a possibility that you raise money and then stop caring about your customers and go into naval-gazing land.""  Not only does Digital Bazaar already have contacts within government, but what's also notable about the team is that it has serious street cred in the digital identity space.  They've been working with groups like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the international standards organization founded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the eccentric computer scientist known as the inventor of the world wide web, for years now on both payments and identity.  On the Veres One project specifically, the group has worked with Rebooting the Web of Trust, a community started by Blockstream's principal architect Christopher Allen; the Internet Identity Workshop; the Decentralized Identity Foundation; and the W3C Credentials Community Group and Verifiable Claims Working Group.  Digital Bazaar's work in W3C undertaking with groups within the organization actually inspired the architecture and governance structures of Veres One.  For instance, the system is patent and royalty-free, and transparency is at the core of the project, with every meeting the board of governors (who hold their position only for two years) and the team has will be public and recorded.  For Sporny, that means the ledger can't be corrupted as easily as others in the space.  While he isn't interested in pointing fingers at any one group specifically, Sporny mentioned the momentum for hard forks, where a group of people effectively start competing networks. And this practice puts pressure on network stakeholders and could incentivize certain things that aren't ideal for the network in an effort to keep certain parties happy.  High hopes  And those politics are what Sporny and Digital Bazaar want to avoid.  Because of the nascency of the technology, ""I don't think people have done really good economic analysis about what an ICO does to a network,"" Sporny said. ""Investors put money in and want a 10X return, in crypto, they want returns that are many times more than that. The problem with doing that in the identity space is not everyone can afford to pay the enormous fees associated with rampant speculation on a cryptocurrency.""  He continued, ""If the costs are predictable then people that are in situations where they don't have access to a lot of capital can still use the system and control their own identity. We aren't building an identity system for people in the West that are rich.""  There's a bit a sermonizing, sure, but it's struck a chord with a whole spate of people that think this is the winning ticket for changing identity online. It seems there's a growing number of people becoming disillusioned with the ICO.  Allen at Blockstream commended Digital Bazaar for bootstrapping the build of an identity platform and not corroding it with a token.  ""There are a lot of people out there that would like to take advantage of some of these technologies [in the crypto space] but the token, the pump-and-dump game is a barrier for them,"" Allen said, pointing to governments, social impact organizations and international NGOs.  And Pindar Wong, Internet pioneer and VerFi chairman, pointed to Peter Steiner cartoon featured in The New Yorker in 1993 – ""On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog"" – saying that during that time people's comments on the internet were judged by their merits.  While the commercial use (and exploitation) of digital identity now rules the web, Wong believes Veres One ""elegantly"" solves several issues with decentralizing identity online.  According to Sporny, if everything in this testing phase goes as planned, the Veres One blockchain will be stabilized and ready for production within two to four months.  Sporny concluded:  ""Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is build a fit for purpose ledger that is built for [the digital identity] use case and only for that use case – no token, no speculation. And we're inviting developers to bang on the network and break it.""

42380376,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NNC7,1519650948,Litecoin Price Outperforms But Nears Key Resistance,"Litecoin (LTC) is the biggest gainer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies Monday, even as it's inching closer to a key resistance level.  As of writing, LTC is changing hands at $228, as per data source CoinMarketCap. The world's fifth largest cryptocurrency has appreciated by 6.83 percent in the last 24 hours, a feat that's notable given other crypto market leaders were hardly ticking up earlier in the day.  A look at the individual markets reveals the trading volume in LTC/USDT (the litecoin-tether exchange rate) and LTC/BTC (the litecoin - bitcoin exchange rate) have increased by 12.9 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively. So, it could be said that investors are using alternative cryptocurrencies and bitcoin to accumulate litecoin.  The price rise could be also associated with litecoin Founder Charlie Lee's tweet asserting his belief the cryptocurrency could overtake bitcoin cash in market cap this year. Further, Litepay, which will allow merchants and businesses to accept LTC for their services and products, will be launched today, and that seems to have garnered lots of attention from investors.  But while the positive news flow justifies the uptick in LTC, price chart analysis indicates the cryptocurrency is nearing stiff resistance zone of $230-$240.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows the hard fork rally ran out of steam last week in the range of $230 to $240. Thus, a convincing break above $240 would signal a continuation of the rally from the Feb. 2 low of $110.20.  However, it is easier said than done as the weekly chart shows indecision in the marketplace, despite the bullish doji reversal.  Weekly chart  View  The odds of a bullish break above $240 are low, according to the weekly chart. A dip below $182.55 (Feb. 23 low) could yield a sell-off to $140.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) above $240 (high volume breakout) would open doors for a sustained rally to $300.

42380361,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NMrz,1519650035,Global AML Watchdog to Step Up Crypto Money Laundering Scrutiny,"The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global inter-governmental body that aims to tackle financial crime, has said it will step up its efforts in monitoring the use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering.  According to a memo published last Friday of its latest meeting, the task force said it has taken on board the findings of a recent report regarding the risks of cryptocurrency money laundering and the regulatory measures being adopted in different countries.  As a result, the FAFT has decided to implement additional initiatives to address the risks of cryptocurrency in money laundering.  Founded in 1989, the task force consists of ministers from its member jurisdictions who help determine standards and execute legal, regulatory and operational measures to fight money laundering, terrorist financing and other cross-border financial crimes.  Although the agency has yet to put out a concrete policy for implementation, the meeting nonetheless signals growing attention from worldwide regulators over illicit uses of cryptocurrency that could undermine the global financial system.  In fact, according to South Korea news agency Yonhap, the country's financial regulator, the Financial Service Commission, was required to brief other 36 member states on its work bringing in anti-money laundering compliance rules for domestic cryptocurrency exchanges.  As reported previously by CoinDesk, South Korea had long been allowing exchanges in the country to offer trading services for investors via anonymous accounts, which, according to the South Korean customs agency, helped facilitate unregistered movement of over $600 million in capital.  South Korea subsequently banned anonymous trading accounts and is now requiring exchange platforms to put in place real name verification of accounts before resuming operations.

42380367,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NMyH,1519646416,3 Class Actions Take Aim at Riot Blockchain's Bitcoin Pivot,"Amid Riot Blockchain's claims to have moved into bitcoin mining and acquiring blockchain startups, investors are accusing the firm of violating U.S. securities law by issuing misleading and false information.  According to court filings, investors in the firm have submitted three class action complaints against Riot Blockchain (on Feb. 17 and 22) in three U.S. states, accusing the firm of share-price manipulation through a dubious cryptocurrency pivot.  As reported previously by CoinDesk, Riot Blockchain is one of the several public companies that have seen major stock price rallies after announcing a blockchain-based re-branding.  In October last year, the firm changed its name from Bioptix to Riot Blockchain. Subsequently the company said its business has shifted from biotechnology to blockchain, including bitcoin mining.  Following the initial announcement, the firm's stock price on NASDAQ soared from around $8 to as high as $38 in December 2017. Yet, shares are now down by roughly 70 percent from those levels, and trading at just over $10.  As a result, investors are filing complaints to courts in Florida, Colorado and New Jersey seeking remedy for the investment loss, arguing Riot Blockchain sent out false information to disguise its absence of genuine blockchain expertise.  One of the filings states:  ""Riot lacked a meaningful business plan with respect to the cryptocurrency business and had only minimal investments in cryptocurrency products; the Company changed its name to Riot Blockchain, Inc. as part of a scheme to capitalize on public interest in cryptocurrency products, thereby driving up the Company’s stock price and enriching inside shareholders.""  Riot Blockchain did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits.  The cases come as the latest that slap on public companies that have seen major price corrections after first recording significant share price surges due to a blockchain pivot.  Previously, Xunlei, a China-based cloud technology company listed on New York Stock Exchange, was also hit by similar allegations that accused the firm of distributing false and misleading information regarding its blockchain-related business.

42380377,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NNAr,1519642806,"Bitcoin Eyes $10K, But Price Outlook Favors Bears","Bitcoin seems to have found acceptance below the psychological mark of $10,000 over the weekend, amid increasingly bearish long-term indicators.  After closing below $10,000 on Feb. 22, bitcoin (BTC) hit an 11-day low of $9,304.68 yesterday, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). As of writing, the BPI has seen gains and is at $9,666.  The cryptocurrency is down close to 20 percent from the Feb. 20 high of $11,768.58, suggesting the rally from the Feb. 6 lows below $6,000 has stalled.  However, trading volumes have dropped 42 percent from the highs seen on Feb. 20, as per CoinMarketCap, indicating supply is drying up. Hence, the drop from $11,767.58 to $9,400 appears to lack substance and a limited corrective rally could soon be in the offing.  1-hour chart  A break above the descending trendline would open up upside towards the head-and-shoulders neckline resistance (former support) seen today at $10,320. A violation there would expose $10,500 (Feb. 24 high).  That said, the outlook as per the weekly relative strength index (RSI) would remain bearish, as long as it stays below the resistance of 53.00 (former support).  Weekly chart  As discussed earlier this month, throughout the bull run (from 2015 to December 2017), the bears were never able to push the RSI below 53.00. However, the RSI fell below 53.00 in January, signaling a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  Note that, despite the bullish doji reversal, the bulls failed to push the RSI above 53.00 last week. In fact, it created a lower high at 53.00 (marked by a circle) last week, as bitcoin fell from highs above $11,700 to below $10,000.  View  The corrective rally from the lows below $6,000 ended at last week's highs above $11,700 and the sell-off will likely resume this week or next week, according to the weekly chart.  BTC is likely to test $8,211 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally) in the short-run. A daily close (as per UTC) below that level would shift attention to $6,000.  A possible corrective rally is likely to run out of steam around the downward sloping (biased bearish) 10-week MA, now seen at $11,251.  Long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change would be confirmed once the weekly RSI has moved above the resistance at 53.00.

No stranger to the blockchain industry, the company, which boasts more than 60,000 accredited investors, has made its name allowing customers to purchase traditional equity in cryptocurrency exchanges and other blockchain startups, including BitFinex, Kraken and BitPay.  However, co-founder and CEO Simon Dixon said that, in recent years, these companies have been moving away from the traditional funding model, encouraging BnkToTheFuture to follow suit.  Dixon told CoinDesk:  ""We’ve been doing this quite a while and then [initial coin offerings] came in and started disrupting our industry. Companies didn’t want to offer equities anymore. The large companies were either not willing to do it or they had a model more suited to the ICO model.""  As a result, this year, the company intends to launch a secondary securities token market for customers, not just accredited investors – one that will allow them trade coins purchased during other ICOs.  This market will comply with U.S. securities laws, and has recently acquired a broker-dealer to help facilitate the launch, Dixon said.  However, it would be difficult for the company’s employees alone to research every company that applies to BnkToTheFuture, Dixon said. As a result, the company also intends to launch a “due diligence platform” where users can research projects themselves. Those who do will receive the company’s BFT token as a reward.  “We wanted to put together a process by whereby we could build a large community of incentivized token holders,” Dixon said.  Though BnkToTheFuture has complied with applicable securities laws since its inception, ensuring its newest market is also compliant is partly a reflection of the broader ecosystem, Dixon said. While some individuals may want to trade on unregulated platforms, startups in general seem to be shifting from that mindset.  “The appetite we’re seeing is a movement toward complying with securities law rather than avoiding them,” Dixon noted.  $100 bill image via Shutterstock  This article has been corrected.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/02/26/bitcoin-startup-backer-bnktothefuture-closes-33-million-ico,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7ac4f2c30c64b9c6cfb93582d5cec359881d453-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42380356,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NMpT,1519635638,"State-by-State Smart Contract Laws? If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It","Perianne Boring is the founder and president, and Amy Kim is the global policy director and general counsel, of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the world’s leading trade association representing the blockchain industry.      John Hancock's signature is easily the most recognizable among the signers of the Declaration of Independence of the United States.  As the story goes, he wrote it large so that if the British monarchy could ""read the name without spectacles; let them double their reward.” In fact, it is so famous that “John Hancock” is synonymous with “signature.”  Today, documents can be legally effective if signed with the “invisible ink” of software. Electronic signatures are just as legally binding as handwritten ink signatures when establishing a contract. E-commerce based on e-signatures has been humming along brilliantly for many years now.  Several very supportive and innovative state legislators are creating legislation for this new technology. While we support their efforts to promote blockchain technology, we believe this action is unnecessary as these so-called “smart contracts” are already covered by existing laws.  Luckily for 21st-century commerce, federal legislation and state laws nationwide ensure that e-signatures are in fact legal and binding means of signing a contract.  Specifically, the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN Act) and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) provide an unquestionable legal basis for smart contract technology executing the terms of a legal contract.  Once cryptographically signed, legal efficacy is granted to electronic signatures, records, and contracts so long as the parties are provided with appropriate written notice and consent to conduct business electronically.  Today, the emergence of these smart contracts has caused some to question whether they are valid under existing law. To be clear, smart contracts are not necessarily “smart” nor are they necessarily contracts.  In simple terms, a smart contract is computer code that programmatically executes transactions in accordance with pre-defined terms. Thus, a “smart contract” may or may not be a contract at all. It may be simply a digital instruction to execute an agreed sequence of events.  Cryptographic signatures (also known as digital signatures), records, or contracts used to execute the terms of a legal contract, entirely or in part, fall squarely within the ambit of the UETA and ESIGN Act. In fact, the ESIGN and UETA legislation were designed to avoid state-by-state enactment of individual laws recognizing digital signatures and records. Any additional regulation would be, at best, redundant.  50 shades of confusion  Unfortunately, it would be potentially confusing for companies and their lawyers to consult multiple sources of legislation when conducting business nationwide.  Rather than consulting the ESIGN Act and UETA, can you imagine having to look at each state's ""smart contracts"" legislation, and then comparing it to ESIGN and the state’s UETA to ensure there are no gaps or conflicts, and to ensure your particular form of ""smart contract"" is covered by the new law?  Enacting unnecessary new legislation (and triggering the associated compliance costs) would undermine confidence in the legally binding status of the digital signature and associated record. New laws could potentially bog down e-commerce.  The Chamber of Digital Commerce has investigated the legal underpinnings of these laws and concluded that enactment of state legislation regarding smart contracts is unnecessary and potentially undermines the growth of the industry.  There are, however, specific legal situations that are not covered by ESIGN and UETA. These include, for example, wills, codicils, testamentary trusts, official court documents, and documents related to family law matters, which should not affect everyday commerce.  The Chamber of Digital Commerce applauds and supports those legislators who are ahead of their contemporaries in understanding the value of this technology and seeking ways to support it. Such action demonstrates their astute sense of the continued success of blockchain technology.  Nevertheless, we caution that this particular course is unnecessary and potentially detrimental to a stable and consistent understanding of the treatment of smart contracts under law. As we wrote in our legal primer on smart contracts:  “Existing legal frameworks for defining and giving legal effect to contracts cover smart contract technology, and nothing regarding smart contracts ought to change existing definitions or the application of current contract law. Additional laws are largely unnecessary and will only serve to confuse the application of current law.”  Or, in plain English: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.

42380363,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NMx1,1519628417,"After Facebook, Will Global Ad Regulators Reject ICOs?","While crypto startups and ICO issuers worry about social media platforms cutting their ads, they could be missing an even more intimidating threat – regulators.  Crypto entrepreneurs reeled late last month after Facebook announced it would be banning ""misleading or deceptive"" ads about financial products and services, including bitcoin and ICOs. These stakeholders saw a crucial advertising avenue dry up, but according to some, the drought isn't over yet.  “The regulators will look at advertisements put out by the company. That’s always something they’re going to look at,” said Johanna R. Collins-Wood, an associate at Pepper Hamilton and member of the law firm’s blockchain group.  Others agreed and voiced concern about the industry where you never have to look too far to find suspect advertisements.  Indeed, crypto advertising is a immensely popular Wild West of sorts, where all token sales, legitimate or otherwise, are all vying for attention. And all the issuers and entrepreneurs in the space are still grappling with just what kinds of claims they can make in their marketing.  If the industry doesn't police itself, regulators are sure to come knocking.  Just recently even, on February 22, France's stock market regulator, the L'Autorite Des Marches Financiers (AMF), released a statement about looking to curb advertising on cryptocurrency-tied derivatives.  And others may soon follow. According to Collins-Wood, some of the regulators that have already taken a more keen notice of the crypto industry as of late will certainly use advertising to build their cases.  For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which held a joint Senate hearing on cryptocurrency earlier this month, will look at whether companies have made fraudulent claims in their ads, she said, adding:  ""If they’re looking to bring a case against a company, they will certainly review all the public statements that the company has made and that would obviously include advertisements.”  'More blatant than others'  Above and beyond financial regulators looking at advertisements to build fraud cases, though, formal guidelines for ads and marketing are less clear at this point.  Many of the regulators that oversee false advertising claims have yet to announce any specific policies on the nascent industry.  “There are a lot of shades of false advertising and misleading advertising. Some are more blatant than others,"" said Carl Johnston, a corporate securities lawyer at FisherBroyles LLP.  Case in point, last year, a crypto ad made the rounds on Facebook with a stolen logo from the New Zealand Herald newspaper and an image of the former New Zealand prime minister John Key with a fake quote claiming he invested in bitcoin.  And in Australia, the continent's securities watchdog received more than 1,200 crypto scam complaints, with one complaint detailing how an exchange advertised that it was an existing Australian company to gain consumer's trust.  Though, maybe the most mainstream example is that of Japanese exchange Coincheck, which ran a TV ad campaign touting, only to be hacked to the tune of $533 million shortly after.  Several industry observers have since accused Coincheck of downplaying its security protections and criticized for skimping on security spending in favor of lavish ads. Indeed, the CEO of SBI Holdings reportedly called the company “scum of scum” for the spending.  As these instances pique regulators interest to the industry as a whole, some believe advertising regulation is not far away, and looking to the regulations facing traditional companies is probably a good place to start for determining how those rules will be laid down.  ""We certainly do have laws against false and misleading advertising,"" Johnston said.  Quiet for now  Although Johnston didn't have any insight into whether the Federal Trade Commision, the government agency charged with overseeing these complaints in the U.S. was active in this area yet.  He told CoinDesk:  “I follow pretty much everything about ICOs that I can and I haven’t seen the FTC’s name a lot.""  The FTC did not respond to requests for comment.  And advertising standards groups have yet to chime in on the subject also. New Zealand's Advertising Standards Authority told CoinDesk it had not received any crypto-related ad complaints, and the UK's ad standards body said they had received less than 10 cryptocurrency-related ad complaints so far.  A spokesperson from the UK Advertising Standards Authority continued, ""And none have resulted in us finding grounds for an investigation.”  Although, the spokesperson did point to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as the regulator in charge of financial ads, but when asked, the FCA said it has no position on crypto ads.  Speaking to the trend to make sure ICO tokens are compliant with securities guidelines, Collins-Wood said:  “Lawyers are telling clients to focus on offerings that are compliant with securities laws. When you do that, that actually opens up avenues for appropriate and compliant advertising and in many ways eliminates a lot of these issues.”  Effects on startups?  It seems like many are taking a wait-and-see approach.  For instance, even though Russia's equivalent to Facebook, VK, banned crypto ads last year, the social media platform lifted the ban in August 2017, stating that the restrictions were removed ""to open even more opportunities for the active development of the cryptocurrency market.""  With more than a million people on the social network following cryptocurrency communities, the company also said it would reject crypto ads that violated its rules by promoting unsupported guarantees.  No other social network has taken a similar position yet. A Twitter spokesperson said it had no comment on cryptocurrency advertising. And Google pointed to its existing policies on misleading ads, which it said would apply to cryptocurrency.  But even if social media platforms moved to tighten up their procedures, it might have minimal impact on the ecosystem.  According to Midori Kanemitsu, CFO of bitFlyer, which ran both a social media and television ad campaign, the Facebook ban had minimal effects.  ""Our understanding is that our TV commercials have contributed to a large increase in users,"" Kanemitsu said.  As such, bitFlyer remains cautious about the claims it makes in its advertising.  “We never advertise large returns, low risks, etc. like the advertising from other organizations. For our internal regulation, we look to existing self-regulatory agencies for other industries,"" Kanemitsu said, adding:  “We are not legally restricted as to the contents of our ads, but we have constructed careful internal self-regulatory procedures that require us to avoid expressions that may be misleading, and we take ad review very seriously.”  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in bitFlyer.

The report reads:  ""Blockchain technology is still very immature.

The article further gives elaborate explanations on blockchain's applications in various industries such financial services, charity, anti-counterfeit and financial regulation.

In an interview with the People's Daily, Hu Danqing, a technology product specialist from Alibaba's Ant Financial Service said: ""Most of the current blockchain hype is focusing on fundraising and speculation instead of genuinely solving real-world problems with the blockchain technology.""

42380368,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NN4Z,1519614014,Venezuela May Limit New Crypto Exchange Launches,"Venezuela's government may move to restrict the number of cryptocurrency exchanges that will be able to operate domestically.  According to a ten-page manual published last week as part of a set of releases related to the country's newly-launched cryptocurrency, the Petro, as few as eight exchanges may be initially approved to operate in the market.  The document, released on Feb. 20, details the requirements by which local crypto exchanges must operate. It suggests that the cap will exist at the outset, under the auspices of Venezuela's cryptocurrency superintendency, before going on to say that the government may modify the limit after the first 90 days of the exchanges' operations.  Sources with knowledge of the ongoing process in Venezuela say that the cap may be more restrictive in practice.  According to Daniel Arraez of BlinkTrade, the government may restrict the number of permitted exchanges to less than that figure. BlinkTrade, which offers open-source software for bitcoin exchanges, is applying to operate under the new petro licensing regime.  Arraez said that the change in regulation could present a significant market opportunity, but only if the exchanges are transparent and perceived as legitimate by the Venezuelan people. Speaking to CoinDesk, Arraez struck an optimistic tone about his firm's prospects.  ""We feel the current regulation change is a positive change,"" he remarked, adding:  ""We're already in conversations to operate as soon as possible if we feel the market is going to be safe and we can get operational guarantees to safeguard our customers funds and safety.""  It remains to be seen how many exchanges launch in Venezuela within its newly minted regulatory framework. Likewise, it's not clear which exchanges are in active talks with the Maduro government, though a report by regional news source Panorama on Feb. 21 quoted Maduro as saying that 36 of ""the main cryptocurrency exchange houses in the world"" are working with the government there.  Still, the document offers a window into the Venezuelan government's thinking on exchange oversight and how it might build an ecosystem around its cryptocurrency.
