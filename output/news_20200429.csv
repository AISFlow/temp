42404595,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdix63,1588195150,Market Wrap: Bitcoin's Price Tear Suggests It's FOMO Time Again,"There’s an old saying on Wall Street that financial markets are driven by two emotions, fear and greed. In the crypto markets, the driver is often a combination of the two: fear of missing out.      The FOMO, as it’s often called, looked strong Wednesday as bitcoin jumped to its highest levels in nearly two months, rising as high as $8,900 while a buoyant stock market shrugged off bad economic data.      At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up an eye-catching 14% over 24 hours at $8,851, well above the 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages, signaling extreme bullish sentiment.      Crypto stakeholders continue to talk up the upcoming halving, an event that happens as often as the Olympic games or a U.S. presidential election, and for many bitcoiners is more important than either.      Read more: Bitcoin Jumps 12% as Fed Keeps Money Flowing and US Economy Shrinks      Around May 12, the amount of new bitcoin mined every 10 minutes or so will drop by 50%, a regular scheduled adjustment that was followed by price increases in 2012 and 2016. Possibly in anticipation of history repeating, in the past five days bitcoin has logged 21% price appreciation.      “The media coverage of the halving over the last five months, combined with continually increasing Google search volume for ‘bitcoin halving’, suggests that we may see similar FOMO around the upcoming halving event,” said Danny Kim, head of revenue for crypto liquidity provider SFOX.      Read More:Bitcoin’s Halving Is Irrelevant for Some Large Traders      Beyond any herd mentality, market participants noted the environment today is very different than during the first two halvings.      ""This halving is taking place in a much more volatile, uncertain macroeconomic environment than all past events,” said Charles Cascarilla, CEO of stablecoin provider Paxos.    Exchange outages    Trading activity spiked Wednesday, nearly overwhelming servers at U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, which suffered brief outages.      Coinbase leads major USD exchange volume in 2020 with three $200 million trading days in April.      The S&P 500 index climbed 2.6% in trading Wednesday despite poor GDP numbers showing the world’s largest economy contracted for the first time in six years.      Stocks’ ascent helps bitcoin but there’s likely a limit to the upside, said Josh Rager, a crypto trader and founder of learning platform Blackroots.      “Personally, I don't know if bitcoin can hit $10,000 but I think as long as the stock market performs well it will continue to have a positive impact on bitcoin,” Rager said.      March’s market bloodbath led to volatility in the S&P 500: Three top-20 record low days and two top-20 record high days in performance for the index that month.      However, April has been all about rebounding for the S&P 500 as government stimulus measures abound. More coronavirus relief is expected to be on the way with U.S. first-quarter annualized GDP numbers down 4.8%, the first quarter-to-quarter decline since 2014.    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board performed well with bitcoin’s jump, and everything is in the green Wednesday. The second-largest coin by market cap, ether (ETH), gained 10% as of 21:00 UTC (5:00 p.m. EDT).      Big-time winners include ethereum classic (ETC) up by 11%, eos (EOS) gaining 9%and bitcoin sv (BSV) climbing 6%. All price changes are as of 21:00 UTC (5:00 p.m. EDT).      Oil is seeing a price rebound Wednesday, up 15% as of 21:00 UTC (5:00 p.m. EDT). Oil output is down and futures on the fossil fuel headed higher, a positive development after the commodity’s two-month bout of high volatility.

The central bank, led by Chairman Jerome Powell, said it would maintain the target range for its short-term lending rate at 0% to 0.25%, “until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price-stability goals.”      U.S. Treasury bonds were mixed on the day. Yields, which move in the opposite direction as price, were down on the 2-year, in the red 8.6%.      Europe’s FTSE Eurotop 100 index of largest companies in Europe ended its trading day in the green, up 1.3% on positive news regarding a potential coronavirus medical treatment.

Bitcoin rallied 12% to $8,703 as of 19:30 UTC (3:30 p.m. Eastern time). The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 3.1%.      In terms of year-to-date performance, bitcoin's returns increased to 20%, surging past gold's 12%. Many cryptocurrency investors see bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold, which could theoretically be a long-term consequence of central-bank money injections. Deutsche Bank estimates that central bank balance sheets have expanded by some $3.7 trillion just since the start of March.      The Fed, led by Chair Jerome Powell, said it would keep benchmark U.S. interest rates close to zero while reiterating a pledge to continue buying U.S. Treasury bonds and other assets in an unbounded amount to keep global markets functioning smoothly. Some economists had speculated the central bank might announce plans to start tapering the asset purchases, which along with emergency-lending programs have ballooned the Fed's balance sheet past $6.5 trillion for the first time in its 107-year history.      Read more: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Money Printer      ""It's clear that the effects on the economy are severe,"" Powell said during a press conference Wednesday. Reporters, based remotely, dialed into the event via a group video call. ""We won't run out of money. It's an unlimited pot.""      The Fed's announcements came after a report from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis earlier Wednesday showing that gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 4.8% during the first quarter as government issued stay-at-home orders. The report provided what economists described as the first official data confirming that the country is sliding into a recession.      Powell, in his press conference, warned that second-quarter economic data will reveal the ""unprecedented"" damage from the coronavirus.      Bitcoin's rally was likely abetted by ""fear of missing out,"" or FOMO, on the part of traders, said Kevin Kelly, co-founder of Delphi Digital, a cryptocurrency research firm.      ""Buying begets more buying,"" he said.    We won't run out of money. It's an unlimited pot.    Bitcoin tumbled 11 percent during the first quarter of 2020, but the price has soared since the start of April.      “Bears are yet to put up any fight and, given the contained squeeze past $8,000,"" said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at BeQuant, a London-based institutional bitcoin brokerage firm.

According to Coinbase’s status page, the exchange’s website, mobile app, and API website experienced major outages. Several Twitter users also noted the connectivity issues with screenshots of the Coinbase website and mobile app.      Kraken reported some issues connecting with its API as well on Wednesday, though it said its platform had returned to normal operations by 18:56 UTC.      Coinbase has gone down during volatile trading days in the past. In June 2019, the exchange's site and API went down during a nearly $2,000 fall over a 15-minute period, an issue that Coinbase Pro users appear to have experienced again in November 2019.      Before Wednesday, the site went down in March 2020 during the crypto market's ""Black Thursday"" crash, when bitcoin shed more than 20% of its value in under 30 minutes.      These issues date as far back as 2017, when Coinbase suspended ethereum and litecoin trades due to outages on its platform.      Coinbase is the largest U.S.-based exchange by traded volume, according to data aggregator CoinGecko.      Still, Coinbase reported over $300 million in daily volume by Wednesday afternoon, which dwarfed its volume for the previous seven days, according to data from Skew.      Coinbase tweeted an announcement about its fix late Wednesday afternoon. The outage ""only affected customers’ ability to access Coinbase and Coinbase Pro UIs, and did not impact trading via our APIs or the health of the underlying markets,"" the company said.      Bitcoin’s price has been on a tear since it crashed to $4,800 in early March. It’s in the middle of its seventh straight weekly gain off of the March lows.

Early crypto adopters had used the exchange to transfer funds to exchanges to acquire bitcoin. Liberty Reserve had its own digital currency (which was not a cryptocurrency), the liberty reserve, or LR.  The exchange was founded by Arthur Budovsky and Vladimir Kats, who, prior to starting Liberty Reserve, had been convicted for operating Gold Age, an unlicensed money transmitting business that allowed users to buy, sell and trade the digital currency e-gold, among others. Budovsky and Kats were both sentenced to five years in prison but the sentence was later reduced to five years of probation.  According to the indictment against Budovsky, Kats and several associates, Liberty Reserve did not utilize anti-money laundering tools such as the know-your-customer (KYC) process, and only required users to provide their name, address and date of birth. The indictment alleged the lack of anti-money laundering controls enabled Liberty Reserve to become “a financial hub of the cyber-crime world.”  The indictment estimated the company processed 55 million transactions worth over $6 billion between 2006 and 2013. Kats went on to plead guilty to charges of money laundering, marriage fraud and receiving child pornography.

The Lebanese pound has lost at least 50% of its value against the dollar since last year. About 220,000 people have lost their jobs. Food prices are up 58%. An estimated 75% of the population needs assistance of some kind. And over the last two nights, at least a dozen banks have been torched by protesters.      The catalyst? Not coronavirus but a massive dollar shortage destroying an economy that relies on inflows of U.S. dollars to function.      In this episode, NLW breaks down how Lebanon models what it looks like for a currency to fail, and why this likely isn’t the last emerging market currency to experience a similar crisis in the months to come.

Transcript      Welcome back to The Breakdown, an everyday analysis, breaking down the most important stories in Bitcoin, crypto and beyond with your host NLW. The breakdown is distributed by CoinDesk.      NLW: Welcome back to The Breakdown. It is Wednesday, April 29th and today we are going to be talking about Lebanon, specifically the currency crisis overlapping a political crisis overlapping a larger economic crisis that is engulfing Lebanon and I think has relevance for how we understand the dollar in the world, the dollar's role in the world and the fallout from COVID-19. I wanted to bring this episode to you because I noticed last week Lebanon start to emerge in the crypto sphere and there were two contexts:      The first was Dan Tapiero. He picked up on a piece by newsBTC noticing that Bitcoin seemed to be trading at fifteen thousand dollars in lebanon via localbitcoins.com which is a peer to peer platform for trading Bitcoin between people. He said the classic emerging market funding crisis was made worse by deflationary dollar peg that is breaking. Study this case as it will be modeled for other weak emerging markets. It will be a key part of the macro story behind the upcoming Bitcoin price rally.      NewsBTC... They titled their article Bitcoin trades at 15 K in Lebanon amidst economic turmoil showing its real potential. That was part one of how this showed up on the Bitcoin radar. And of course you see Bitcoin trading at a seemingly 100% premium against what we were seeing it at. It's going to cause notice.      The second context that Lebanon has had within the Bitcoin sphere, the Bitcoin Twittersphere, is images and videos of riots in Lebanon... Where protesters are smashing banks and setting fire to banks over the last two days. And that is happening, but it has a specific context and I think it's incredibly important to dig into this because this is not just a single country, this is a country that is representative of I think a number of potential challenges that a variety of huge emerging market contexts are going to face in the coming months and the coming years.      And it deeply implicates the question of the role of the dollar in the world and the role of external currencies. So what I'm going to try to do today is give you a primer on how Lebanon got here, how this crisis happened, what this crisis means, and what the real implications are. Now, a couple caveats. First, I am obviously not a Lebanon expert. It is not my main field. It is not my main point of view and I have put this primer together humbly by doing my own research of the last six months of Lebanese political and economic turmoil. That said, I do have some context in this region. I first went to the middle East in 2004 to study in Cairo. I went back and forth a number of times, probably a dozen times over the course of the next five years or so.      I thought that I was going to spend my life doing either Middle East conflict resolution or just conflict resolution more broadly and spent time all around the region, including in Lebanon and Syria. Again, this was a long time ago. I was in Lebanon last in 2006 and Syria last in 2006 as we know, those places are very different than they were then, but this is not a complete neophyte perspective. I guess I do have some time booked both in the region and spent looking at the history of the region. I'm not going to get too deep into history today. I'm really just going to focus on what's been happening over the last six months and put it in the larger global economic context we have. Here's the TLDR on this. This is not a story of Bitcoin trading at a premium because people are desperate to get into Bitcoin.      This is a story of a local currency failing and people trying to find any on-ramp to access any US dollars that they can. That's the real story and that's the important piece of this conversation. Let's do a little bit of Lebanon economic basics first. A key thing to note is that this is a country where almost everything consumed is imported. That's a really important note because as we'll see, imports are purchased with dollars and then sold for Lebanese Lira. Even before all of this happened, Lebanon had a huge debt to GDP ratio, one of the worst in the country between 150% to 170% debt to GDP ratio. This is a country that borrows a lot. It has had a dollar peg since 1997 of approximately 1500 Lira to one US Dollar. It has had a dollar peg since 1997 of 1500 Lebanese pounds or Lira to one USD.      An article in the New York times described this rate thusly, they said, ""but maintaining that rate required continually bringing new dollars into the country, usually by enticing wealthy investors to make large dollar deposits for high interest rates. A strategy that some economists have compared to a Ponzi scheme."" We'll get into this more in the banking system more in a minute. But the key part for our purposes is that since 1997 the dollar has been pegged 1500 Lebanese pounds to one US dollar and it's been maintained through central bank policy. This is an economy that is 70% dollarized and it has only been sustainable because of diaspora inflows back to the country. So a huge number of Lebanese depositing money into the Lebanese banking system from abroad as well as from inflows from other regions. So Lebanese banks have attracted huge foreign inflows for years and years and years through offering high interest rates and basically that allows the country to pay for imports even though it has such low exports.      So in this way, the banking system is really key to the economy. The deposit base in fact in Lebanon is usually something like 2.5 to three times the size of the economy. However, the banking system is hugely compromised right now. And this is not just a coronavirus thing. In fact, as you'll see, this story is not particularly a coronavirus issue, although as with everywhere else, the coronavirus shutdowns have exacerbated the situation, so the banking system is compromised. 70% of assets are lent to the state itself, but government bonds are trading 40 to 50 cents on the dollar. Of those 30% of loans that are to the private sector, 25% of those are non-performing. And what that means when you add everything up from the central bank balance sheet is that half of the assets of banks are impaired. They're problematic. This could be okay in some short term way if there were still huge inflows from abroad into the banking system, but there haven't been in the same way because of regional turmoil.      There is the obvious crisis of the war in Syria, which has been ongoing and dragging the entire region down. There is trouble with Iran who basically uses Hezbollah to meddle in Lebanon's affairs and has for decades. There is a crisis with the relationship with Saudi Arabia, which went really bad in 2017 to say the least and I will point you to more resources to learn about that, but when that relationship went bad, we saw some of the first gasps of dollar outflows in late 2017 1.5% of cash deposits were withdrawn from the Lebanese banking system in fear of what that regional turmoil might do. So effectively we have a very unstable economy that is largely propped up by a robust banking sector that has been attractive to both foreign Lebanese as well as to the region for years, but as political crisis engulfs the region and compromises that banking system, it makes the system of continued inputs very compromised.      And so this is the context for where we started to see real problems happen last year. The center, underlying problem which metastasizes and metastasizes in this situation is not enough dollars to keep this economy going. As I was mentioning before, if you have a net import economy that uses dollars and your local currency interchangeably, what happens is that all of those purchases of imports happen in dollars, right? If the U S is sending wheat or anything else to you, it's going to bill you in dollars, not in Lebanese pounds, but then your local market, your local consumer base, uses those Lebanese pounds to buy that good. The peg keeps that system working, but if the peg starts to break, it can deteriorate incredibly quickly. Keep in mind as well that there is a dollar shortage around the world. This is not a Lebanon unique situation.      The U S dollar has been the strongest and clearest asset, the world's global reserve currency, not just theoretically, but in a way that is profound for a long time. And so imagine the pressure of trying to get dollars everywhere, but manifested in a specific nation-context like Lebanon. That's what we've been dealing with. So last August the 1500 Lebanese pound to us dollar peg started to break. In September, an economic state of emergency was declared and the government actually used WhatsApp to say that they plan to raise taxes to cover government expenditures. This sparked protests because there was already a lot of questions around the legitimacy of government and corruption in government. So when the government said that they were going to come seize citizen money through taxes, basically to cover their expenditures, there was a wave of protests. This was exacerbated in October. On October 11th there was a nationwide strike demanding the ability to pay for fuel imports in Lira, in Lebanese pounds rather than dollars. A sign seen on Twitter said, we apologize to the Lebanese people due to the lack of dollars to buy fuel.      “We are closing our petrol station until we can secure this product in Lebanese pounds.” So again, this is the situation we were just describing. Petrol station owners sell their fuel in Lebanese pounds, but have to buy it in US dollars from importers. This also happened to mill owners. People who are bakers who buy imported wheat in US dollars. What happens of course, is that as the peg starts to come undone, that itself creates more demand for dollars, which causes the peg to come further undone. So put yourself in the situation of your average Lebanese person. You're seeing these strikes around fuel importers around bakeries who aren't able to get the dollars they need to buy the imports that allow their businesses to work. You're an average citizen. You say, well, damn, if there's dollar shortages, I need to go get my dollars out, which causes a run on the bank.      Banks start to limit withdrawals, which is exactly what happened. Banks started to limit how much could be withdrawn in USD and that creates more demand for dollars. All of a sudden that activity moves to the black markets because if banks won't allow people to withdraw money or get access to dollars, black markets will, but the black market price is not going to stay the same as that official peg. This keeps going on. As people start to see the peg fall further, they want to minimize loss. They go from, ""I don't want to lose the value that I would have had at that official peg going on the black market"" to ""The black markets, the only place I can get those dollars, if it's 2000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar, now, I want to lock in that loss rather than worry or take the risk of a loss of greater debasement of the value of the Lebanese pound in months to come.      So it's a very vicious cycle. So, big protests start in October. Prime minister resigns at the end of October. Protests continue through November. Fast forward to February, early March... GDP is down from 55 billion to 44 billion. 220,000 jobs in a country of 5 million are lost between October to February. Food prices are up 58% and key parts of the industry are just totally left shuttered. So this is a quote from an article. Importers of critical goods such as medical supplies, say their requests for dollars have gone almost entirely unmet since February. Leaving many hospitals dangerously low on everything from heart stents to dialysis equipment on March 7th an extraordinary thing happens for the first time Lebanon defaults on a foreign currency debt payment. This is one thing that was holding Lebanon together is that it had a relatively high standing in foreign markets because it didn't do things like default on debt payments.      It did in March for the first time and then COVID-19 hits and the economy is locked down since the middle of March, which is just pouring gasoline on an absolute dumpster fire already. So let's look again at what's happening in the currency markets as this foreign currency default happens in the beginning of March, the official exchange rate remains at 1500 Lebanese pounds to the dollar, but on the black market, money changers are getting 2,500 pounds to the dollar. There are a growing wave of people who are extremely worried, right? Think about middle-class Lebanese who are paid in Lebanese pounds, but who owe tuition or mortgages that are denominated in dollars. It's the story that we hear over and over again in dollar denominated debt. No one can get dollars to bring in goods from abroad. So businesses are shuttering and to make matters worse, and this is how these economic crises play out.      Lebanese banks, which are terrified of bank runs, are continuing to reduce how much people can actually take out of their accounts and they're doing so with caps, they are setting the exchange rate price lower than what the black market is saying. Then we get to April and things get really bad. The official peg is still at 1500 but it's gone to 3,500 in black markets. A few weeks into April bank start making some small concession. They allow small depositors to cash out dollar savings, but at 2,600 pounds, so this is obviously more than the 1500 but way less than the 3,500 pounds that the black market was saying a dollar was worth. The blame game heats up between the prime minister and the central bank governor in a televised speech, the prime minister said the central bank is either incapable, absent, or directly inciting this dramatic depreciation.      There's clear politicking involved in, like I said at the beginning, there's so much to Lebanese politics that I can't get into it now, but it's worth looking into, but there's credence for these accusations, at least in the context of regular citizens and protestors because the Lebanese bank has at this time been trying to buy up all the dollars they can from money transfer companies at a rate of 3,625 Lebanese pounds to the dollar. So in short, the Lebanese bank is trying to buy as many dollars as they can get their hands on at a rate that's much higher than the exchange rate that they're allowing Lebanese citizens to withdraw at, which is obviously going to cause incredible foment. There's no way that people are going to just let that pass, especially when the prime minister is saying that the central bank governor is to blame for this crisis, which brings us to this week and the videos and images you've seen on Twitter of banks burning around Lebanon.      Aljazeera called this the night of the Molotov and for the last two nights at least a dozen Lebanese banks have been torched, vandalized as part of this growing frustration. Effectively these protests are now turning violent because the desperation is getting to reach a fever pitch with no end, no clear plan in sight. Even before all this, it was estimated that poverty was around 50% in the country at the beginning of the year. Now, the social affairs minister of the country is estimating that some 75% of the population require aid. Meanwhile, the economy, what's left of it is still shut down because of the coronavirus. That's where we are now. We have a crisis in freefall which has lost at least 50% of its value against the dollar and realistically more since the middle of last year with a rate of descent that is increasing.      We have a political instability where an already compromised and unloved government is blaming the central bank for this machination. We have an economic system that's based not on economic fundamentals but financial engineering that requires an ever growing influx of foreign investment, foreign currency into the system that once that dries up just shuts down. All told what you have is that complete currency collapse and by extension economic collapse of a nation that has at times been one of the bright lights of a very troubled region. Let's return back to the article that got Bitcoin's attention in the first place. This idea that Bitcoin was trading at 15,000 Lira in Lebanon amidst economic turmoil showing its real potential. The article was based on the sell price on local bitcoins.com of a Bitcoin going for as high as 22,678,227.03 Lebanese pounds per token. If you divide that by the official expressed Lebanese pound to dollar rate, which is 1500 you get this 15,000 number.      That's where it comes from. It is factoring in or it is assuming that the exchange rate of 1500 is the actual exchange rate. As we've discussed, the real exchange rate in Lebanon right now is somewhere between 2,600 which is what the banks are offering people to withdraw there. Lebanese pounds at or 3,600 which is what the central bank is paying for dollars on the open markets and what Lebanese are paying in the black markets. When you divide this offer of 22 million Lebanese pounds per Bitcoin by those numbers, you get a number that looks pretty much exactly like what Bitcoin was selling for everywhere else. Does this mean that we shouldn't see Bitcoin as an interesting, relevant asset for this region? Should we dismiss this idea that it is ""showing its real potential?"" My answer is ""absolutely not"", but we have to understand how Bitcoin and other digital assets are functioning in the real world right now.      The story of Lebanon that I've just told, which is the very TL;DR version is a story where people don't have control over their money. Their money is predicated on a banking system that has its own interests, its own machinations, its own incentives that for a while aligned with theirs. But as soon as it didn't, shut down their ability to actually control their wealth and effectively enabled their wealth to be reduced by a factor of 50% in the course of just a few months. Imagine that you had been saving in a bank doing what you're supposed to do, being a good citizen, putting away your money for years and years and years and over six months. It's cut in half simply by the debasement of the currency. That's what we saw. What Bitcoin is reflective of and how people are using it in this crisis is trying to escape a local monetary regime that is crumbling.      What the world is doing though, and I think that we have to expect this is going to be the case for some time, is they're escaping, not into Bitcoin per se, but the dollar. The dollar is the world's escape valve currency. Even in Lebanon, before this turmoil, the whole system was predicated on being able to move easily into the dollar. The problem is that as the dollar becomes the only asset for the entire world, there's a shortage of them and it becomes harder and harder to get into the dollar. Now, the interesting thing is as we watch the total circulating supply of USD based stable coins rise, I think that's part and parcel of this as well. It is people trying to get dollar exposure and escape from local monetary regimes by accessing the digital currency world. This is not a diminishment of Bitcoin, but we also need to be clear that it's not some super premium because Lebanese who are desperate are trying to get into this new currency.      Lebanese who are desperate are trying to get to the currency that they've always used to actually pay the key debts that they have, which is dollars. We live in a dollar denominated debt world until that is no longer the case, part of Bitcoin's role is going to be to help people escape out of these local monetary regimes, which are collapsing and get money to where it needs to be into different currencies. Even synthetic ones. I don't think that's a knock on Bitcoin. I think it's in fact an affirmation of its power as an uncontrollable non-sovereign currency. But we have to speak about what is actually true, not just go for the headline. So hopefully this has been an interesting or enlightening look at what's going on in Lebanon. As I said, I am not a Lebanese expert. I put this together on the basis of just my own research and reading, but I fear that it is reflective of a lot of places we're going to see around the world that face this same perfect storm of a bad local monetary regime and currency crisis that ensues, a shortage of dollars that makes it worse and the lack of a fundamental basis for the economy that can solve it.

Let me know because this is a little bit of a departure, although to me, I think this is the type of issue that is sort of the most important for us to really, really understand.

IBM develops private and permissioned blockchains, which stand in contrast to public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. IBM notably utilizes Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source blockchain protocol developed by the Linux Foundation-hosted Hyperledger consortium, as the base layer of its blockchains. Some of IBM’s projects include logistics solution Food Trust, cross-border payment World Wire and identity management solution Trusted Identity.  IBM was a founding member of the Hyperledger consortium, which was created in 2015. The project offers a development library to allow businesses to create customizable distributed ledger solutions without using a public blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum. While IBM contributed many lines of code to this project, it was built through a consortium-wide effort that included companies such as Digital Asset, Accenture, Fujitsu, SWIFT, VMware, Wells Fargo, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Wells Fargo. In 2019, the consortium’s membership exceeded 250 companies across 14 developing projects.  Created in 2016, IBM Food Trust is a blockchain solution that makes food items traceable as they move through the supply chain. The system aims to help eliminate food fraud, accurately judge shelf life, ensure the quality of food and minimize food waste. In 2019, the digital tracking system for retailers and suppliers had grown to over 80 brands. Some of the project’s major participants include Walmart, Albertsons, Dole, Nestle and Carrefour.  IBM’s Blockchain World Wire facilitates cross-border payments between financial institutions via the stellar blockchain protocol. Essentially, two financial institutions agree on a stable currency, central bank digital currency or other digital asset as a bridge to connect fiat currencies. World Wire then converts the digital asset into the second fiat currency, facilitates the transaction, and records the detailshttps://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/YW3W2JPZ on the blockchain. The project aims to allow international transactions to take place faster than they would through traditional processes while maintaining transparency. As of 2019, World Wire has facilitated transactions across 72 countries.  IBM’s Trusted Identity project is intended to give individuals more control of their digital identity, allowing a choice of when, where, and with whom they share their information. As of 2019, this project remains in its alpha version, but nonetheless hopes to decentralize identity management. The project is based around three “self-sovereign identity concepts,” which include decentralized identifiers (DIDs) under the control of a user, verifiable credentials as cryptographically backed statements of truth, and decentralized key management as a way for users to verify interactions through DIDs.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,Matthew Kimmell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/ibm-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18937ee436c2ff52b83f469e3605a9d151273448-2560x1706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Arweave operates on the same idea as other blockchain-based file storage services such as Filecoin or Storj, but with far larger ambitions backed by new technical developments unveiled Wednesday as Arweave 2.0.      The team is working toward “virtually unlimited” and permanent data storage for what they compare to a digital Library of Alexandria.      Read more: Filecoin, But Forever: Arweave Raises $5 Million to Build Out ‘Permaweb’      “[Arweave 2.0] takes the mechanisms that we built in Arweave 1.0 and scales it up basically to [storage] sizes that are so large that it becomes indistinguishable from infinite for the normal user,” Williams said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.    Tech tools behind 2.0    The team is leaning on two new features with Arweave 2.0, Williams said: the “Fast Write” mechanism and bundled transactions.      Technically speaking, Fast Write keeps the proof of a transaction occurring in a Merkle root accessible on the network while pushing data to local storage on nodes that wish to carry the information. This makes the network lighter and faster.      Bundled transactions, on the other hand, are a Layer 2 technology. Each Arweave transaction can be moved off-chain, mixed with other transactions and then placed back onto the main chain as one large transaction.      Together, Williams said, the scaling tech makes storage on Arweave near “infinite.”      The two technologies are not that different from options Ethereum, the blockchain behind ether (the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap), has been exploring for its upcoming switch to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The Eth 2.0 research team led by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is considering stateless clients and polynomial commitments, which can act as lightweight digital receipts for transactions.      Watch: Vitalik Buterin Explains the New Tech Behind Eth 2.0      Ethereum platforms such as IDEX have also incorporated a similar Layer 2 option called Rollups to scale transactions by moving them off-chain.      As for Arweave’s future, the team is eyeing Arweave 2.1 for later in 2020. The goal remains the same: unlimited, permanent storage. Williams said the next update should get Arweave to the finish line.      “People just use it and people build stuff on it and often they don't even tell us anymore,” Williams said, referencing the dozens of decentralized apps (dapps), from finance to gambling, that make up the Arweave library.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIL | AR | TOKEN SALE,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/29/arweave-20-gets-file-storage-project-one-step-closer-to-its-library-of-alexandria-dreams,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a95f62eafbed083d9eccf1fd3477c12c1977c7a-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404598,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdix72,1588182127,Blockchain Bites: What the Bitcoin Halving Means for Miners and Prices,"Predictions and price models proliferate ahead of Bitcoin's programmatic halving, expected in less than two weeks.      While some are turning to esoteric economic models to make the claim that the occasion will be bullish for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, others believe it'll be a non-event. Still, the halving is already showing real-world effects, with major mining manufacturers slashing prices and small-time investors... investing. (To be fair, these trends could also be attributed to COVID-19-led market distortions.) Here's the story:      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.    Top Shelf    Halving Predictions: Mining & Price    Hut 8, one of the largest publicly listed mining companies, is likely to be affected by the incoming bitcoin halving event. The firm’s profitability has declined over several quarters, its mining rigs are struggling to compete and it carries a heavy load of fixed interest debt. CoinDesk Research takes an in-depth look into Hut 8’s financials and risks in a free report, available for download here.  Meanwhile, mining manufacturer Bitmain is said to have booked over $300 million in revenue for the year to date. (The Block) Still, the firm has already begun marking down the prices of its machines ahead of the halving event.  Bitcoin's third halving, less than two weeks away, is often touted as a catalyst for a price surge. It’s certainly led to a surge in interest and speculation around the cryptocurrency. Yet, some traders think the halving will be negligible compared with other macro-level events like unprecedented central bank monetary policies as well as the everyday trading levels on exchanges.  However, believers in Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model are predicting a bullish run after the halving. This esoteric economic model tracks a commodity’s existing supply against how quickly new stock enters the market. “This hypothesis … is that scarcity, as measured by S2F, directly drives value,” PlanB reportedly said. Decrypt’s Colin Harper takes a look at the theory.  Forbes also weighs in on the debate, with contributor Luke Fitzpatrick predicting “a new class of crypto millionaires may emerge.” (Forbes)    Messagin' Mnuchin In a letter addressed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, 11 members of Congress, suggest blockchain and other distributed technologies could boost liquidity and help distribute federal stimuli during the COVID-19 crisis. “Such steps will ensure both that America retains its technological advantage and that relief is delivered quickly to the small businesses and individuals who need it most,” the letter reads.

COVID-19-led market volatility is cited by the bank as cause for an increase in deposits, according to the company’s earnings report.      Nasdaq Taps Corda The Nasdaq stock exchange has partnered with R3 to offer a platform for digital asset marketplaces on the Corda blockchain. As of today, capital markets participants can use Corda to support the issuance, trading, settlement and custody of digital assets.      Skew & Kyte Skew, a crypto derivatives data aggregator, has launched a trade execution platform and raised $5 million to help build out its new brokerage services. Partnering with UK-based Kyte Broking, skewTrading is focused on attracting institutional investors.      Stop, Stop. Stuttgart To Be Kidding Me The bitcoin exchange arm of Boerse Stuttgart has added a “stop order” trading function to help customers deal with volatile market conditions. Stop orders help people automate aspects of their trading strategy and, rather than having to watch the market 24/7, let them establish points at which they want to buy or sell.      Lnurl Something New Everyday A new standard known as Lnurl is attempting to improve the user experience of Lightning, Bitcoin’s scaling layer. Lnurl aims to simplify Lightning transactions to just a click or a QR scan. Zap, Phoenix, Breez, Blue Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi, as well as dozens of other apps, have quietly integrated the standard.      Surveilling Drones The U.S. Department of Transportation has issued a report advocating for blockchain to track the use of commercial drones. The distributed technology can be “used by stakeholders in the commercial drone industry, as it can ensure security and provide for identity management as well as providing a supporting role in aircraft traffic management, [drones] conflict management and flight authorization,"" according to the report.      Regulatory Shifts    The New York Department of Financial Services has appointed Richard Weber, former chief of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service, as its new general counsel. Weber led the IRS division during the agency's investigation into the Silk Road darkweb marketplace.  Brian Quintenz, commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, will not seek renomination and plans to stay on until his successor is appointed, following a five-year term. A long-time crypto advocate, Quintenz is noted for sponsoring the Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) and advocating for self regulation in the crypto industry.    Taking Flight Alexander Pack, managing partner of Dragonfly Capital Partners, has stepped down from the crypto investment firm, citing “a difference in vision on the direction of the firm.” Dragonfly launched in 2018 with $100 million under management and the mission to bridge investments between the U.S. and Asia.      Riding on Bison Decentralized finance protocol Keep Network has tapped Bison Trails, a Libra Association member, to provide non-custodial staking services for tBTC, an ERC-20 representation of bitcoin deposits. “Infrastructure is important because if your node is being asked to sign a message or it’s holding onto BTC as one of the shards, you ideally don’t ever want to be offline,” Bison Trails protocol specialist Viktor Bunin told CoinDesk in an interview.      Staking Ahead There are now at least 61,980 addresses with a balance in Kyber Network Crystal, an Ethereum token that fuels operations on the currency’s native exchange. This all-time-high comes ahead of a planned upgrade that would allow token holders to earn staking income on the decentralized Kyber Network.      Series A Taurus Group secured over €10 million in a Series A funding round led by Arab Bank. The firm now looks to expand its digital asset business and open offices in London, Paris and Frankfurt.      Ripple Exec Deplatformed YouTube has suspended Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s channel. This follows quickly on Ripple’s lawsuit, which claims the streaming giant failed to redress XRP scams and Ripple impersonators in videos. ""Weirdly, YouTube just decided to suspend my channel (SJoelKatz) for impersonation. I wonder who they think I was impersonating,"" Schwartz tweeted.      Little Guys Go Big The number of network addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC (~$770) has continued to hit all-time highs, climbing to 3,010,784 on Monday, according to data from Glassnode. Beginning in February, exchanges have seen an increase in small purchases of bitcoin.      Coinbase of DAOs The OpenLaw LAO, or “Limited Liability Autonomous Organization,” opened Tuesday for investors looking to compliantly earn returns on the next wave of Ethereum-based projects. Initially capped at 100 accredited investors, the LAO will pursue venture capital deals via a smart contract that automatically pays out returns. If Coinbase legitimized the model first put forth by Mt. Gox, Wright said, the LAO could do the same for DAOs, said OpenLaw CEO Aaron Wright.      Crunchbase for Crypto Everest, an Ethereum-based social registry for tracking crypto projects, launched yesterday with an index of 100 decentralized projects.

42404588,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdix27,1588181457,How Blockchains Become Great Big Garbage Patches for Data,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is a partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.       In the Disney Pixar movie “WALL·E,” the eponymous robot hero trundles around an abandoned Earth, methodically compacting mounds of old garbage. The planet had become barren and sterile, covered in the residual detritus of rampant consumerism.       If we’re not careful, most public blockchains will share the fate of WALL·E’s Earth, destined to become deserted repositories of ancient garbage: not with physical garbage but junk data, irrelevant, anachronistic and disused.       See also: Nic Carter - Corporate America Knows the Bailout Is Baked In      There’s a lot at stake. Blockchains that welcome the “highly available generic database” use case will suffer one of two dismal fates: either nodes become practically impossible to run long term, or node operators will discard data, weakening immutability promises.       While Bitcoin’s approach to constricted block space (and consequently higher fees) dis-incentivizes the insertion of arbitrary, non-transactional data on chain, other competitors insist on low fees, effectively subsidizing marginal usage. This has had visible effects already – and introduces long-term risks that will have to be reckoned with.     Are transactions an asset or a liability?    To understand why using blockchains for storing arbitrary data is a bad idea, let us consider them in the abstract. A blockchain manages the continuous auction of block space to the public in exchange for fees (and a subsidy). Miners can claim these fees in exchange for constructing and ordering blocks. Transactors tolerate these fees because the blockchain generates strong settlement assurances that can’t be found elsewhere.      The quality of these assurances is largely a function of security spend, which is itself constituted from fees and the subsidy. Fees arise from the interplay between a bounded quantity of block space and demand to use that block space. Lastly, remember that node operators are the ones bearing the costs of data being added to the chain. Any data added today is effectively an externality that node operators have to tolerate in perpetuity.       So is a payload of data – a transaction – an asset or a liability? It depends. I’d venture that a transaction is an asset to the blockchain if two conditions hold:    The transaction carries a fee that is at least somewhat proportionate to the costs it imposes on the node operators  The data is likely to be relevant to future data entries; it is current.    That transactions should contribute to security spend is obvious. That they should involve currency is not. In effect, there’s a maturity mismatch between the way people use blockchains and their long-term maintenance costs. Public blockchains are intended to store data in perpetuity; they achieve this impressive feat by replicating the database across many nodes. However, as mentioned, they rely on the willingness of node operators to ingest, store and serve up this data forever. If transactions impose a significant cost relative to their contribution to the security of the blockchain, they are a net negative.       So I’d venture that data inscribed on-chain is an asset to the extent that it’s economically relevant and will contribute value to the system by inducing users to transact. It’s a liability to the extent that node operators must ingest the data, validate it and store it. If the data is a UTXO, it’s highly likely to be relevant in the future: Transactors eventually spend their coins. If it’s spam relating to an airdrop for a transient token, it may never be relevant again. And what node operator wants to foot the bill for terabytes of irrelevant, uneconomical data?    An unpriced externality    To be clear, the Bitcoin-like blockchain model isn’t perfect. Bitcoin depends on the willingness of node operators to download and propagate blocks without compensation, a bit of an oddity in a system that is otherwise strongly driven by free market incentives. To account for this, Bitcoin developers have been careful to limit the amount of block space available such that node operation is still possible on commodity hardware. Depending on how you count it, the entire blockchain is still only about 274 GB, even after 11 years of operation. Levying an ongoing tax on storage, as the state rent proposal aims to do for Ethereum, is another potential solution to the problem. Other blockchains, in their eagerness to differentiate from Bitcoin and its purportedly high fees, created a zero- or low-fee environment.    Far from making blockchains more convenient, unlimited block size and zero fees render them less reliable.    But, of course, fees serve as a sort of financial proof-of-work. They require transactors to insert only information to the chain they consider worth paying for. This makes it more expensive to generate spam and discourages wasteful usage modes. Since demand for perpetual, highly available storage is almost infinite (wouldn’t you create a highly-available, perpetual cloud backup of your 10 TB torrent collection if storage was essentially free?), it’s likely low- or no-fee chains will be filled with junk data, given enough time.       Predictably, this is what has happened. Reduce the clearing price for inclusion on a replicated, highly available database to zero and expect opportunistic spammers who can take advantage. Numerous examples abound. A huge fraction of transactions on Stellar relate to a service called Diruna that apparently incentivized users to spam the blockchain. Diruna appears to be defunct now. Its on-chain footprint lives on, though, effectively indelible. Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin bear the imprint of an application called “Bitcoin Aliens,” a tool that pays users minuscule amounts for viewing ads.       Something called “Blitz Ticker” accounts for up to 50% of BCH transactions on any given day. Its purpose? Inserting market data onto the blockchain. Ethereans may remember a period in mid-2018 when the biggest consumer of gas was a mysterious exchange called FCoin, which ran a competitive token listing scheme that incentivized individuals to spam the blockchain. A pattern emerges: private gains, public externalities. FCoin is insolvent now, but its impact will be felt on Ethereum forever because token transactions cannot easily be disentangled and pruned out.     The OP_RETURN compromise    Bitcoin’s approach to the issue was to designate an opcode to act as a kind of sink for non-transactional data. Previously, people were encoding data in addresses directly, which were mostly indistinguishable from normal transactions. Thus OP_RETURN was chosen specifically to handle arbitrary data, so it could be identified and pruned out by nodes with little difficulty.       As it turns out, Bitcoin’s protocol is designed to cultivate its own UTXO set. OP_RETURN saw significant usage from Omni (which powered Tether transactions) and Veriblock, but little else. The impact on the blockchain is fairly low; Strehle and Steinmetz find that OP_RETURN data in Bitcoin accounts for around 3% of the overall blockchain data overhead. Should it grow, however, nodes would have the option to discard OP_RETURN outputs altogether, as they are provably unspendable and not relevant from a transactional perspective.      See also: Crypto Progressives Become Conservative With Their Own Chains      Ultimately, node operators on blockchains that are burdened with lots of non-transactional data will have to consider periodically pruning their datasets. This is convenient but trades off against the desirable quality sought in blockchains of data immutability and availability. If validators/archivists can effectively perform eminent domain by arbitrarily deleting data users consider important, their assurances on that chain are effectively nonexistent. So we have a situation where the discarding approach stands in direct opposition to a desirable quality of public blockchains, which is making data available to users in perpetuity.      The issue is that if even one single entity has an interest in the existence of some otherwise-nuisance data, validators cannot eliminate that data without effectively depriving this individual of their property. But there’s an enormous asymmetry here: One economically minded individual can essentially compel all present and future users of the blockchain to ingest their transaction. The alternative is the unpalatable choice to disempower commodity nodes and opt for a model where only the largest nodes survive.      This tension is unresolvable unless the available data slots are strictly bounded and fees are employed to meter blockchain usage. Open the gauge and deal with either data loss and user frustration, or unbounded state growth and impossible validation.      Far from making blockchains more convenient, unlimited block size and zero fees render them less reliable and virtually guarantee either the long-term loss of supposedly immutable data, or require the compromise of decentralization at the node level.

Released Wednesday, the second annual Crypto-Confidence Index poll conducted by the European arm of the exchange, bitFlyer Europe, found 66% of respondents believe cryptocurrencies will continue to exist in 10 years' time.      The survey, conducted via Google Surveys, polled 10,000 individuals across 10 Europeans countries to arrive at its results, the exchange said.      The 2020 response is a 3% increase on the results of the survey a year ago, which bitFlyer said demonstrates growing confidence in cryptocurrencies despite the ""crippling effect"" the coronavirus has had on the global economy.      According to Worldometer, a COVID-19 tracking website, there have been more than 3.1 million total coronavirus cases globally, with over 218,000 deaths so far. The impact on the global economy has been huge, with predictions it will result in a recession bigger than anything since the Great Depression.      Zooming into the survey numbers, Italy – one of the most impacted countries from the pandemic in the European Union – was found to be the most optimistic regarding crypto's future, with almost three-quarters (72%) believing they will continue to exist in some form in 10 years' time.      Following close behind were the Netherlands and Poland, with 70% of respondents from those nations saying cryptocurrencies will continue to exist in a decade. Spain was third most optimistic with 68%.      “It is pleasing to see these results that indicate a slow but steady progression of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream consciousness,"" said Andy Bryant, COO at bitFlyer Europe. ""Although we might look at this as an achievement for digital currencies in spite of the challenging economic times we are facing, it is also worth considering that this may well be partly because of these times.      U.K. respondents were revealed to be the least confident. Even so, more than half (56%) still took the long view for the financial tech. The U.K result increased considerably to nearly two-thirds (61%) when narrowing the results to respondents between 18 and 44.

42404578,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiwsH,1588168191,Bitcoin Wallets Are Adopting This Tech to Simplify Lightning Payments,"The Lightning network might be key to the future of bitcoin, but it still has a long way to go in terms of user experience.       To tackle this issue, the standard known as Lnurl is quietly gaining ground. Without much fanfare, it's been adopted in some of the most popular Lightning wallets including Zap, Phoenix, Breez, Blue Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi, as well as dozens of other apps.       Sending or receiving Lightning payments can often require a bit of set-up and a number of steps. Lnurl aims to simplify many common actions so that they instead require just a click or a QR scan.       Lightning payments are an experimental payment method that could greatly improve the Bitcoin network, making payments faster, cheaper, and more scalable. But so far, the user experience (UX) is even more confusing than Bitcoin's, which, with its private keys that cannot be lost and jumbled addresses, is weird enough for the average Joe as it is.       That's why developer and Bitcoin Lightning Wallet creator Anton Kumaigorodski decided to create a standard that would improve Lightning's UX, hiding a bit more of the underlying complexity from users.       ""I've noticed some clearly visible UX issues specific to Lightning Network wallets, all of them are solvable but require some kind of standard for wallets to converge on. Lnurl aims to be such a standard,"" Kumaigorodski said.       Read more: First Mover: For Bitcoin Prices, Inflation Headlines May Matter More Than the Reality      The advantages include making it much easier to request ""inbound liquidity,"" meaning the user needs to make sure enough bitcoin is in the right spot in the network in order to receive payments, which is one of the more common and troubling UX problems for users. It also cuts out a couple of steps when sending money in a few common scenarios.     Receiving funds    This is a lot of information that someone needs to know before using Lightning, making it a pain to use, especially compared to more intuitive mainstream alternatives such as Venmo or PayPal.       For example, to use Lightning, a user needs to put some of the bitcoin into the second-layer network by opening a ""channel"" with someone else. Say Alice deposits one bitcoin on her side. If Bob, her counterparty, has no money on his side, then she doesn't have ""inbound capacity.""       This means she can send payments but can't accept them.       To fix this, Alice would need to open a channel with someone who has bitcoins on their side.       This is an obvious roadblock for easy payments over the network. Many new users open a channel, then run into the problem that they can't accept payments and aren't sure what to do.       A number of services such as Lightning Loop and Bitrefill's Thor have launched to help users retrieve inbound capacity.       With Lnurl (specifically, the part of the standard called Lnurl-channel) the process is greatly simplified, making these services a bit more automatic. A user just clicks a link to pay a little bit of money to retrieve more inbound capacity.       Read more: Nasdaq Is Using R3’s Corda for Managing Digital Assets      ""You could scan a QR code and request an incoming channel from a service,"" Lightning and Bitcoin Core contributor Tim Akinbo said.       The Breez wallet, for instance, adopted ln-channel in its point-of-sale app so merchants can top up their inbound capacity by scanning a QR code or clicking a link.       ""No IT know-how is required,"" Breez CEO Roy Sheinfeld said.      Moving funds around    Another piece of the specification, Lnurl-withdraw, also makes it easier to move funds around.       Say you earn some bitcoin in a Lightning app (a ""lapp"" in Bitcoin lingo). Maybe you win a few cents worth when playing the game Bitcoin Bounce, or someone tips you on Twitter via Tippin. The pocket change you receive will initially be stored in the app.       However, say Alice wants to move her money from a game to her wallet so it's under her control or so she can spend it elsewhere (such as to automatically dispense food to chickens over the internet and watch them eat it over webcam). Without Lnurl, sending the funds to her wallet takes several steps.       First, she needs to create an invoice in her wallet. Then she copies the long, jumbled string of letters and numbers generated to identify where the funds are to be sent. She switches over to the game, clicks on the withdrawal page, pastes in the invoice and clicks send.       Read more: Network Bringing Bitcoin to DeFi Taps Libra Member Bison Trails for Staking Services      Lnurl potentially reduces this process to a simple scan in the app from which she's moving funds away.       ""One of the improvements include the ability to simply scan a QR code and withdraw funds from a service directly to your wallet, without the pesky workflow of generating an invoice and then submitting it,"" Akinbo said.       It's worth noting that so far this standard only works in the wallets and apps that support it. The more wallets that use this standard, the better, Kumaigorodski said. Every service that adopts it will ease the process for users, doing a small part toward making the Lightning network easier to use for mere mortals.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/29/bitcoin-wallets-are-adopting-this-tech-to-simplify-lightning-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/358f7d11abd60d2108ca18a9c1b20c975cc2f7bb-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404571,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiurK,1588166634,Silvergate Adds 46 More Crypto Clients in Q1 While Existing Customers Increase Deposit Levels,"Silvergate Bank added 46 crypto customers in the first quarter and saw fee income and deposits increase from those customers because of “Black Thursday,” according to its earnings report released before market open on Wednesday.      “The increase in total deposits from the prior quarter was driven by an increase in deposit levels from our digital currency customers who maintained excess capital with Silvergate as a result of the dislocation taking place in the digital currency markets during March,” the bank wrote in its earnings release.      The publicly traded La Jolla, Calif.-based bank is one of the few U.S. banks willing to serve crypto-related businesses and has most of its deposits from the crypto sector.      The bank went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol SI in November. With $2.3 billion in total assets, it’s less than 1% the size of JPMorgan Chase’s $3.1 trillion in assets.      Read more: Crypto-Friendly Silvergate Bank Goes Public on New York Stock Exchange      The bank now has 850 digital currency customers, including 61 exchanges, 541 institutional investors and 248 other customers. The largest customer segment increase was in institutional investors, which increased by 32. The bank also claims to have more than 200 prospective clients in its pipeline.      Deposits from digital currency customers increased by 35% to around $1.7 billion, making up the majority of the bank’s total $2 billion deposits. Other deposits at the bank decreased by around 45%.      Average balance of deposits was up by only $100 million while deposits for period end were up $400 million, because of institutional investors putting more cash back into their accounts, CEO Alan Lane said on an earnings call Wednesday.      The bank’s cost of deposits continued to rise from .84% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to .87% in the first quarter of 2020. This is around the average for mid-cap commercial banks and is up from the first quarter of 2019 when the cost of deposits was .08%.      Fee income from digital currency customers increased by more than $300,000. In an earnings call, Lane said that each of the fees for the bank remained flat or increased this past quarter. Last quarter fee income and deposits dropped, even while the bank was adding more customers.      Read more: Silvergate Bank Adds 48 Crypto Clients in Q4 Even as Deposits Slip 4%      The bank’s net income was $4.4 million, up by 22% from last quarter but down 53% from the same time last year.      The bank’s Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) handled 31,405 transactions in the first quarter compared to 14,400 transactions in fourth quarter of 2019. This was more than triple what the number of transactions were on the SEN a year ago. SEN’s volume increased by $7.8 billion to $17.4 billion total in the first quarter.      The network allows commercial customers to instantly move U.S. dollars between different crypto exchanges and remains open on nights and weekends, unlike traditional markets.      The bank plans to add more products to the SEN in the future, including a bitcoin-on-margin lending feature called SEN Leverage which is currently in pilot mode. The bank has approved $12.5 million in bitcoin collateralized loans so far and plans to roll out the product in 2020.      In the earnings call, Lane said the bank continues to explore product options around crypto custody and settlement. In response to analyst questions, Lane also said the bank is exploring whether or not it should play a “more active role” in the stablecoin space, beyond just offering basic banking services to stablecoin issuers.      In answer to a question about how Silvergate might benefit from the launch of Libra, Silvergate executive vice president of corporate development Ben Reynolds said that the bank offers cash management products for quickly transferring fiat to stablecoin.      “I think it’s fair to characterize this as we’re investigating it and keeping our options open in working with all stablecoin participants,” he added.      The bank also kept a high risk-based capital ratio – total capital to risk-based assets – in the first quarter, staying around 26% where other banks are normally around 12% to 14%, said Mike Perito, a bank stock analyst at investment firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.      The bank also established a referral partnership with Seacoast Commerce Bank in National City, Calif., for customers seeking assistance under the U.S. government’s Paycheck Protection Program. Neither Silvergate nor Seacoast broke out how many, if any, of Silvergate’s crypto clients applied for PPP loans.      Silvergate also increased its provision for loan losses to $400,000, compared to no provision for the fourth quarter of 2019. While the bank serves the crypto industry on the deposit side, it turns those deposits into interest-bearing deposits at other banks, investment securities and loans.      Like many traditional banks, Silvergate’s largest segment of loans are made up of commercial real estate and one- to four-family real estate loans. Because of the bank’s low loan-to-value margins and its low exposure to the hospitality and retail space, none of its modified loans have been considered troubled debt under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Lane said.      Silvergate holds a fiscally conservative position so it can focus on building out products for the crypto sector, he added.      “While the outlook of the economy remains uncertain, our first-quarter results clearly demonstrate the steps we have taken to prepare for a digital world,” Lane said.

42404569,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiupM,1588161039,"Bitcoin Rises Above $8.1K, Clinching an April Gain for Fifth Year Running","Bitcoin's price jumped above $8,100 on Wednesday, making an April gain for the fifth consecutive year all but certain.      The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to $8,191 at 11:15 UTC, its highest level since March 10, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      At press time, bitcoin is hovering near $8,170, representing a 4.5% gain on the day. Prices are now up 26% on a month-to-date basis and 13.6% year to date.      An April gain would be confirmed if prices hold above $6,428, the monthly opening price, through Thursday's UTC close.      While a price pullback in the next 24 hours cannot be ruled out, a drop all the way back to levels under $6,428 looks unlikely, as technical studies are biased bullish and the speculative buzz surrounding the upcoming mining reward halving is likely to limit any losses.      So, bitcoin looks set to end April in the green, having put in a positive performance in the same month over the last four years.      Bitcoin has performed well in April in six out of the last eight years. The cryptocurrency suffered moderate losses in the two down years.    Best performing asset    Bitcoin's price performance looks more impressive if we take into account the fact that it's outshining other major assets by big margins.      While the cryptocurrency is up over 25% for the month, gold, the classic safe haven asset, has gained 6.4%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500, Wall Street's equity index, has risen by 10.8% so far in April. The dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major currencies, is reporting marginal gains.      Meanwhile, the West Texas Intermediate crude, the North American oil benchmark, is down 36%. Oil prices collapsed earlier this month as the massive demand fall-off caused by the coronavirus outbreak saw storage facilities at full capacity across the globe.      Bitcoin was widely expected to print gains in the run-up to halving event due in 12 days. Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk on April 1 the halving event would create upward pressure on bitcoin’s price. ""Investors will take up positions in anticipation of rapid appreciation post-halving,” Dibb said.      Bitcoin undergoes the halving every four years – a process aimed at controlling inflation by reducing block rewards for miners by 50 percent.      There's also been a general consensus in the market that bitcoin will rise in April on the back of the unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus lifelines launched by authorities across the globe to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.      Both the stimulus billions and the bullish halving narrative may continue to bode well for bitcoin in the short-term. Some analysts expect the cryptocurrency to rise as high as $10,000 ahead of the reward halving.      Post-halving, though, the cryptocurrency may face selling pressure. ""This time, news that the bitcoin halving is happening is widely known, it’s less likely that it will drive prices upwards as much as it did the last time,"" said Andy Ji, Co-founder of Ontology, a public blockchain and distributed collaboration platform.      See also: Looking for a Halving Payday? Quick Wins in Investing Are Rare      Indeed, the halving has been extensively discussed for more than a year and the market may have largely priced it in. As a result, ""sell the fact"" trading may be seen after May 12.      Cutting the block rewards by half also means miners will have a tough time making a return on their investments. Thus, if prices fail to rally, some miners may exit the market and offload their holdings to cover costs, leading to a deeper slide in prices.      It's worth noting that the 2012 halving was followed by an immediate 10% sell-off, while a 38% decline trailed the 2016 event.

42404575,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiutI,1588159894,"First Mover: For Bitcoin Prices, Inflation Headlines May Matter More Than the Reality","Bitcoin traders love to talk about inflation – especially the possibility consumer prices might eventually shoot up due to the trillions of dollars of new money injected into global markets this year by the Federal Reserve and other central banks.      The theory is the purchasing power of government-issued currencies will diminish due to the surging supply of money, and that should be good for bitcoin, viewed by many cryptocurrency investors as a hedge against inflation.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Such arguments have helped to boost price for bitcoin, which traded Monday around $7,700, up 7.8% on the year. The performance looks especially impressive when compared with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, down 11% in 2020.      But do most people really understand how inflation works, or how the rate might change as the coronavirus pushes the global economy toward its worst recession since the early 20th century? The answer, it seems, is not really.  The Conference Board, a 104-year-old think tank, published survey results on Tuesday showing a record drop this month in U.S. consumers' assessment of current business and labor-market conditions.  Elsewhere, consumer expectations for inflation over the next year have now jumped to 5.3%, their highest since October 2014, and up from 4.5% a month earlier, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at the forecasting firm Pantheon Macroeconomics.  These numbers are so far off the current inflation rate, as measured by the Labor Department's consumer price index, that it's hard to take them too seriously. They're also contrary to the recent trend, which shows prices falling, not rising, in response to the deflationary forces of an economic contraction.  Some 25 million jobless claims have been filed since mid-March, typically a harbinger of falling wage pressures; oil prices are down nearly 80 percent; roundtrip flights from the U.S. to Europe are going for $200. An April 10 report from the Labor Department showed that prices increased by 1.5% in the 12 months through March, slowing from the prior month's 2.3% pace.      Here's what the month-over-month picture looks like:      So why are consumers worried about inflation? Maybe it's because of the daily headlines about new U.S. government aid and bailout programs, and about the money freshly printed by the Federal Reserve to finance them.      ""Presumably this signals a degree of uneasiness at the extent of the mitigating actions taken by the Fed and the federal government,"" Pantheon's Shepherdson wrote Tuesday in a note to clients. ""We think the risk of a near-term increase in inflation is remote.""      Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday is expected to discuss the U.S. central bank's latest thinking on inflation at the conclusion of a two-day closed-door meeting, policymakers' first regularly scheduled gathering since the pandemic sent global markets reeling.      Ben Ayers, senior economist at the insurer Nationwide, told CoinDesk Tuesday he predicts consumer prices in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be about 0.3% lower compared with the prior year.      Longer term, though, the consumers might be right about the price rises they'll see. Mickey Levy, a former Bank of America chief economist who now works at Berenberg Capital Markets, wrote Tuesday the Fed's ""aggressive increase in base money and the unprecedented spike in federal-deficit spending have sown the seeds for a significant rise in inflation.""      ""While any risks of inflation seem distant to the current challenges posed by the sharp economic contraction and fragile financial markets, they should not be ignored in strategic planning,"" Levy wrote.      All this brings the discussion back to bitcoin.      The cryptocurrency is seen as an inflation hedge because of its limited supply, which was hard-coded into the Bitcoin blockchain network's 11-year-old programming code. Next month, in fact, the Bitcoin network is scheduled to undergo a once-every-four-years ""halving,"" which will cut the pace of new issuance by 50 percent.      Traders are split over whether the halving will actually drive up bitcoin's price, given that it's been on the schedule for, well, 11 years, and thus is likely known by just about anyone with a Coinbase, Binance or BitMEX account.      But the timing of the halving, set against the backdrop of Fed money injections, presents a spectacular opportunity for bitcoin bulls to bask in a free marketing bonanza: Scores of headlines are likely to emerge, both in the crypto press as well as mainstream publications, dutifully explaining how the quadrennial halvings make the cryptocurrency more inflation resistant.      ""As rare as an eclipse, a World Cup and your best friend buying you a drink, the Bitcoin halving generates a lot of excitement in crypto circles,"" CoinMarketCap, a data provider owned by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, wrote Tuesday in a blog post. ""Buzz is a-building.""      ""One thing you can be certain of is that it will draw increased attention both from those inside and outside of the crypto industry,"" Jack Purdy, of the cryptocurrency research firm Messari, wrote Tuesday. ""With this increased attention, one might expect an increase in the desire of traders to express their viewpoints, which could lead to an uptick in volatility amidst the halving hype.""      Francis Pouliot, CEO of Canadian over-the-counter bitcoin exchange Bull Bitcoin, told CoinDesk's Zack Voell he sees the halving as overblown. Rather, he says, it's the Fed's money injections that provide a “marketing impact” for bitcoin.      Even the New York Times earlier this month mentioned a meme popular with bitcoin traders, ""Money Printer Go Brrr.""      So it might not be the halving itself that drives up bitcoin prices but the halving headlines – and any more announcements coming out of the Federal Reserve.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $8,117 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $8,175 | 24-Hr Low: $7,684      Trend: Bitcoin has passed key resistance around $8,000 and is eyeing stronger gains ahead of the reward halving due on May 12.      At press time, the cryptocurrency is hovering near $8,120, representing a 4.5% gain on the day. Prices have notably crossed the widely-tracked 200-day average, bolstering the short-term bullish setup.      Indeed, the area around $7,972 was packed with multiple technical resistances. For instance, the 100-day average was located at that level, while the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from $10,500 to $3,867 was seen at $7,960. Further, the trendline falling from Feb. 13 and Feb. 18 highs was around $7,965.      A convincing move above a major resistance cluster often invites stronger chart-driven buying, so bitcoin could continue to gain altitude ahead of the reward halving.      Other indicators are supportive of continued gains: the 5- and 10-day averages are trending north, indicating a solid upward momentum; the 14-day relative strength index is reporting strongest bullish bias in over three months with an above-65 print; and the higher bars on the daily chart MACD histogram are another sign of strengthening of bullish momentum.      Adrian Zduńczyk, chartered market technician and CEO of trading community The BIRB Nest, thinks the cryptocurrency's got room to rally to $8,400 and $8,600.      Meanwhile, some analysts expect bitcoin to test five figures before May 12 on the bullish narrative surrounding the supply-altering event.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/29/first-mover-for-bitcoin-prices-inflation-headlines-may-matter-more-than-the-reality,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64b49afed2fa6dbad23e2e907077fe7679dcdbaa-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404562,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiulQ,1588154400,"Crypto Data Provider Skew Raises $5M, Launches Trade Execution Platform","London-based Skew, a provider of real-time data analytics for crypto derivatives, has launched a trade execution platform and raised $5 million to help build out its new brokerage services.      Announced Wednesday, skewTrading is a partnership with U.K.-based Kyte Broking focused on attracting institutional investors entering the cryptocurrency space. The $5 million in funding, led by London-based Octopus Ventures, adds to a $2 million seed round raised in September of last year.      Read more: Kleiner Perkins Backs $2 Million Seed Round for Crypto Derivative Data Firm      Before co-founding Skew in September 2018, Emmanuel Goh and Tim Noat worked as equity derivatives traders for U.S. banks JPMorgan and Citigroup. To begin with, skewTrading will focus on over-the-counter (OTC) execution of Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) block trades for bitcoin futures and bitcoin options on futures contracts.      “We are still at a stage with crypto where the key institutional moment hasn’t really occurred yet,” said Goh. “So you want to build a bridge really. We decided to cover first the CME futures and options product because we believe this is where those institutions will get comfortable first.”      A good example of this was the recent news that New York-based hedge fund Renaissance Technologies is considering adding CME bitcoin futures to the instruments it trades.      Read more: ‘Long Bitcoin’ It Ain’t: Crypto Traders Make Sense of Renaissance Filing      The bulk of the interest is coming from crypto-native asset managers, hedge funds and OTC desks, said Goh, but once in awhile a traditional asset manager, hedge fund or big bank will sign up for Skew’s derivatives analytics.      “It's not the majority, but we do see it regularly. Those guys are watching and doing their homework,” he said.      The partnership with Kyte means Skew becomes the former’s “Appointed Representative” with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Goh said Kyte’s National Futures Association (NFA) membership helps with access to U.S. clients.

42404567,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiuoN,1588152622,Boerse Stuttgart's Bitcoin Exchange Adds Stop Orders as Volatility Hedge,"The bitcoin exchange arm of Boerse Stuttgart has added a trading tool to help customers deal with volatile market conditions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic and the approaching halving event.      The German exchange group said Tuesday that clients of its Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange (BSDEX) would now be able to use stop orders – an order to buy or sell an asset once its price has passed a pre-defined point.      Launching in September, BSDEX provides regulated access for both institutional and retail investors to a bitcoin-euro trading pair.      In March, the exchange group's chief digital officer said the subsidiary is hoped to become one of the trusted gateways for regulated institutions to enter the digital asset space. BSDEX has said it's planning to list other digital assets going forward.      In a statement, BSDEX CEO Dr. Dirk Sturz said stop orders were a ""logical step"" for the fledgling exchange, adding they were ""particularly important in the current volatile market phase. [As they] enable investors to react automatically to price volatility and to pursue a momentum strategy.""      Stop orders help people automate aspects of their trading strategy and, rather than having to watch the market 24/7, let them establish points at which they want to buy or sell. While long a feature in traditional markets, they are increasingly commonplace in crypto: Binance, Kraken and Huobi have all already added them to their exchanges.      See also: dYdX’s Crypto Loans Hit $1B Amid Coronavirus-Led Volatility      But there are some pitfalls, as stop orders can just as easily compound losses for a trader, especially those not accustomed to trading cryptocurrencies.      It's no secret cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets. Back in June, for example, bitcoin flash crashed as the spot price fell from $13,700 to just under $11,400 in little more than an hour. It then temporarily recovered back to $12,000, before sliding back below again nine hours later.      If a trader had put a stop order to sell at $12,000 and then gone out for lunch, they would have returned to see their position liquidated and, to add insult to injury, watched as the price then returned within the range they wanted to hold at anyway.      With bitcoin's volatility levels hitting a six-year high earlier this month, CoinDesk asked Boerse Stuttgart if it was an appropriate time to add stop orders for its clients, particularly as many may be more familiar trading traditional assets than cryptocurrencies.      See also: You Call That Volatility? Bitcoin Traders Scoff at Wall Street’s Gyrations      In an email, Sturz told CoinDesk that stop orders allowed investors to manage and reduce risk, adding that they could be used to ""pursue a momentum strategy as they can react to ongoing price trends, both with stop buy orders in bull markets and stop sell orders in bear markets.""      He added that BSDEX had also implemented ""volatility interruptions"" to protect traders from having all their stops triggered in a flash crash.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/29/boerse-stuttgarts-bitcoin-exchange-adds-stop-orders-as-volatility-hedge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2c23253223b98fb1f806686725a053a5c88e96b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404549,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiuba,1588147200,US Transportation Dept. Says Blockchain Could Bring More Trust to Commercial Drones,"Safety and data protection are major concerns when it comes to the growing use of commercial drones, but blockchain could provide a working solution, according to a recent report by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT).      The tech report says commercial usage of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) is becoming increasingly prevalent in today's society in applications ranging from consumer deliveries to emergency response to transporting medicines and organs for transplant.      However, logistics relating to the safe management of swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as well as air traffic management and reliable operations near ""high-risk"" areas such as crowded areas or airports are proving problematic. That's where the tracing and tracking of individual drones via the blockchain can make a difference, the DoT says.      ""Blockchain technology is being looked on to deliver a framework that can be used by stakeholders in the commercial drone industry, as it can ensure security and provide for identity management as well as providing a supporting role in aircraft traffic management, UAS conflict management and flight authorization,"" according to the report.      See also: Drone Data Service to Create Blockchain-Based Black Box      In certain instances, blockchain technology could be used to address particular trust and integrity issues when it comes to drone systems, too. Flight data recorders (black boxes), for example, provide data to help investigators understand what a UAV was doing before an incident occurred, similar to those installed in all aircraft in the airline industry.      A blockchain-based flight recorder, or ""black box,"" could enable law enforcement to be proactive in monitoring drones' flight patterns in real time, providing the information to help navigate around a perceived threat or incident. It could also help industry regulators track and review drone flight data to make smarter decisions about the safest route to a particular destination.      The Federal Aviation Industry (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have begun leading an industrywide standardization effort for drone traffic management. Since 2018 Boeing has been developing a traffic management system for all drones that use artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, the report notes.      NASA has also proposed a blockchain-based framework for the FAA-mandated automatic dependent surveillance broadcast (ADS-B) system enabling aircraft privacy while guarding against spoofing, denial of service, and other security risk factors.      See also: IBM Patents Blockchain to Stop Drones From Stealing Packages      While drones show ""much promise"" across various industries, their automated nature makes trust ""a significant issue.""
