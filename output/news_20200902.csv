42384604,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkgKx,1599084600,US Lawmakers Advocate for Blockchain Use in COVID-19 Relief Efforts,"Members of Congress are urging the federal government to use blockchain solutions to boost COVID-19 relief efforts.      In a Wednesday letter addressed to the U.S. President Donald Trump and federal officials, lawmakers said blockchain technology can help identify and authenticate individuals set to receive government benefits, streamline supply chains and create a registry of medical professionals.      This is the latest development in a trend of U.S. lawmakers actively advocating for blockchain applications and virtual currencies, with representatives re-introducing bipartisan legislation in January that would reduce the tax burden on small crypto transactions, and Massachusetts Representative Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) proposing a bill in April to record national stockpiles on a blockchain.      Read more: US Congressman Tom Emmer Will Accept Crypto Donations for Reelection Campaign      The letter was led by the four co-chairs of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus: Reps. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Bill Foster (D-Ill.), David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) and Darren Soto (D-Fla.).      They were joined by Caucus members Stephen Lynch, Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), Jerry McNerney (D-Calif.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).      “The membership of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus urges your consideration, support and implementation of utilizing blockchain technology that could greatly mitigate the effects of the [c]oronavirus,” the letter said.    Ongoing effort    This is not the first time members of Congress have urged the government to consider innovative technologies in the pandemic response. In April, 11 representatives signed a letter calling on the U.S. Treasury Department to consider blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in streamlining the distribution of stimulus funds to citizens across the nation.      Within a week of sending the letter, Lynch introduced a bill to mitigate the failures of the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) in distributing personal protection equipment such as ventilators to those in need: it would require relevant government agencies to use private blockchain technology to inventory supplies in each state to ensure availability.      Read more: Bermuda Starts Development of a Blockchain-Based National ID System      The goal of the bill is to facilitate the creation of a network that would allow the government to have a transparent view of stockpiles, and allocate resources to where they are most needed, Lynch told CoinDesk back in April.      “I think there are reasons for adopting a very secure protocol. You could envision instances where if the country were at war you would not want this system to be hackable and so I think the private blockchain model probably works best,” he said.    'Wake-up call’    The lawmakers’ letter to Trump echoes Lynch’s call to use blockchain to create secure and efficient databases.      The letter makes a case for a blockchain-based identification system, to securely store and authenticate an individual’s identity “to receive necessary funding or supplies”      The lawmakers explained how the built-in architecture of blockchains can help easily identify individuals when receiving government benefits, while its strong encryption protects sensitive data. It also urged the government to consider putting crucial supply chains that would map origins, inventories and transportation routes on a blockchain.      “The lack of these fundamental supplies has served as a wake-up call across the nation as we continue to struggle to track, reroute, and deliver necessary supplies to those who need them most,” the letter said.      The lawmakers also suggested that blockchain could help create a comprehensive registry of medical professionals that would verify qualifications, locations and help deploy “skilled resources” in times of crisis.      ""Federal regulators must be willing to shed the bureaucracy and implement new solutions,” Rep. Emmer said in a statement to the press.

42384603,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkgSV,1599084000,BitGo Will Provide Cold Storage Crypto Support for Japan’s Bitgate,"Japanese crypto exchange Bitgate will soon offer customers cold storage services through BitGo Inc., meeting new legal requirements set by the local financial regulator.      BitGo announced Wednesday it would provide its “Self-Managed Custody” service to the exchange, which is supervised by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA). Japan-based financial services firm Daiko Holdings secured a controlling stake in the exchange earlier this year.      These are requirements by the JFSA, said BitGo CEO Mike Belshe, with new regulations going into effect this past May reflecting an increased amount of attention paid to security in a country that has suffered some of the crypto world’s largest exchange hacks.      According to a press release by BitGo, the solution was built for the Asian markets, and enables security features like multi-signature wallets that ensure there isn’t a single point of failure which could lead to a breach or loss.      “This probably stems in fact from the long history that Japan has with crypto,” Belshe told CoinDesk. “As you know, crypto in Japan has been pretty strong, but we've also had a couple of really prominent losses over time, one being Mt Gox, and later Coincheck.”      Read more: Crypto Exchange Coincheck to Launch Japan’s First IEO      The regulator mandates exchanges use cold storage for the bulk of their clients’ assets, Belshe said, which BitGo agrees is a best practice for the industry.      BitGo currently provides services to six of the 24 licensed exchanges in Japan, Belshe claimed, and the company has been meeting with the regulator for years.      In his view, the JFSA recognizes the risk that exists with storing assets online, whether that’s in the crypto space or other, more traditional firms. This may be part of why it recommends offline solutions for regulated entities.      “I think Japan thinks a lot more about breaches,” he said. “I think culturally [it cares] a lot about the reputation of the country, and what it means when there's a loss inside a firm” based in Japan.

42384621,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkggL,1599078268,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Falls to $11.1K; Ethereum Miners at Record Fee Percentage,"Bitcoin took a dive Wednesday. Ethereum miners are benefiting from all that DeFi.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,396 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 4.8% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,159-$12,058  BTC above its 10-day moving average but below the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Read More: Bitcoin Price Drops 4% After Latest Rejection at $12K Resistance      Bitcoin dropped to as low as $11,159 on spot exchanges like Coinbase Wednesday. The fall was exacerbated by long-oriented derivatives traders on exchanges like BitMEX. That platform experienced $9 million in sell liquidations in one hour as prices fell, the equivalent of a margin call in the cryptocurrency world.      Alex Mascioli, head of institutional services at crypto brokerage Bequant, said long traders were convinced bitcoin’s price would surpass 2020 highs but instead were wiped out. “Bitcoin still needs to break above its previous high at $12,400 to have enough serious momentum to have a chance of retesting previous highs,” he said.      There is a chance that next time bitcoin hits that price level it could head into higher territory, approaching 2020 highs around $12,475, Mascioli added. “For now, $12,400 is the most important resistance level the bulls must take out. The technicals appear as if the bulls may retest this level in the next week.”      Read More: Total Value on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Sets Another Record High      Meanwhile, the rise of decentralized finance, or DeFi, gives hardcore bitcoin holders an opportunity to profit even when price moves are bearish on days like Wednesday.      “The DeFi market is giving long-term bitcoin holders a chance to increase their yields and return,” said Zachary Friedman, chief operating officer for Global Digital Assets.      However, some traders aren’t convinced DeFi can maintain its status quo, and that is reflected in bets on the options market for ether (ETH). Based on probabilities, options traders have 66% confidence ether will be over $400 by September 20 maturity, but that number drops to 48% by December 20 maturity.      “I have a sneaky feeling that ETH options are going to be in play given the amplifying uncertainty brought about by variables such as yETH and the punitive gas fees,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. yETH is a product from Yearn.Finance that allows ether holders to deposit the crypto and gain yield by leveraging various other DeFI projects.      Read More: Open Positions in Deribit’s Ether Options Hit Record High Above $500M    Ethereum mining hits record fee percentage    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Wednesday, trading around $436 and slipping 8.5% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

It crossed the 70% threshold Tuesday as DeFi projects that run on the network are pushing gas prices, the unit of account for transactions and smart contract interactions, to fresh highs.      While fees are a problem, many stakeholders say this cost inherent to Ethereum is a better price to pay than in the traditional financial world. “The DeFi market removes one crucial intermediary – the bank,” said Global Digital Asset’s Friedman. “With fewer parties taking a cut, and much more transparency, as well as a collateralized lending system ensuring high levels of security, all the benefits of lending can fall onto the lender and thus remove the majority of costs,” he said.

42384612,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkgXX,1599077705,Hardware Wallet Flaw Lets Attackers Hold Crypto for Ransom Without Touching Device,"A recently disclosed vulnerability in two popular hardware wallets would have allowed attackers to hold users’ cryptocurrency for ransom without going anywhere near the device.    ShiftCrypto, the Swiss company that manufacturers the BitBox hardware wallet, has disclosed a potential man-in-the middle ransom attack vector on the rival Trezor and KeepKey hardware wallets.  A ShiftCrypto developer known as Marko discovered the vulnerability in the spring of 2020, and notified the Trezor and KeepKey teams respectively in April and May. A Trezor representative confirmed to CoinDesk that the attack ""is only theoretical and has never been performed in practice.""  ShiftCrypto did not suggest the attack had been carried out, only that an attack was possible.  Trezor has patched the vulnerability for its Model One and Model T hardware wallets. KeepKey (which is a fork, or copy, of Trezor and so runs near-identical code) has not made a fix, according to the ShiftCrypto team, who said the manufacturer cited “higher priority items” as the reason. CoinDesk reached out KeepKey to ask the team why they deemed the attack vector low priority but did not receive a response by press time.  The hypothetical attack involves an optional passphrase that Trezor and KeepKey users can set to unlock their device in lieu of the usual PIN code. Both hardware wallets require a USB connection with a computer or mobile device to manage accounts. When plugging the hardware wallet into the other device, a user would type the passphrase into the latter to access the former.  The problem is that neither Trezor nor KeepKey would verify the passphrase users entered. Verification would require displaying the passphrase on the wallet’s screen so the user could ensure it matched what they typed on the computer.  Without this safeguard in place, a man-in-the-middle attacker could have modified the information relayed between Trezor or KeepKey and their users by importing a new passphrase into the wallet. The user would be none the wiser, since he or she couldn’t check that the passphrase on the device matched the one on the computer screen.  Upon inputting the old passphrase, the user would open the hardware wallet’s interface on the computer as usual. Each address generated, however, would be under the control of the new passphrase set by the hacker, so the hardware wallet user would be unable to spend funds locked in these addresses.  The attacker, however, would not have access to these addresses because they are still derived from the wallet’s seed phrase, so they can only be held for ransom. Thus, even if the hacker had access to the real passphrase, he or she would need the seed phrase or access to the device itself.  This ransom attack could be executed against multiple users at once, and multiple cryptocurrencies could be taken hostage at the same time.  Trezor and KeepKey have had run-ins with vulnerabilities in the past, but most of these required physical access to the hardware wallets to succeed with a couple exceptions. The one discovered by their competitor broke ground by allowing the hypothetical attacker to work remotely.

42384613,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkgcZ,1599075988,"For DeFi to Grow, CeFi Must Embrace It","William Mougayar is the author of “The Business Blockchain,” producer of the Token Summit and a venture investor and adviser.      DeFi has grown to a point where its mindshare now far exceeds its relatively small crypto market share. It has benefited from a catchy name, and continues to spawn catchy words like “sushi.” DeFi sounds better than what it is: “automated algorithmic financial products with no central human intermediaries and plenty of decentralized computer-based protocols as the intermediaries.”      That said, no matter how you cut it, DeFi’s market share numbers are still relatively small. By market cap, hovering at $16 billion, DeFi is about 4% of the total crypto market. By transaction value, even at $13 billion for a trailing 30 days, decentralized exchanges represent 0.3% of overall crypto exchange trading value. By value locked, at $9 billion, that’s 2.4% of the total crypto market value. By users, at 160,000 (estimated), that is 0.32% of the 50 million blockchain addresses.      See also: Donna Redel & Olta Andoni – DeFi Is Just Like the ICO Boom and Regulators Are Circling      Granted, the above numbers only offer a static snapshot of DeFi. They do not give us the full dynamic picture on its velocity and vibrancy. To counter its tiny market share footprint, DeFi’s growth rates have been vertiginously high (into the three or four digits of growth depending what you are looking at), and from an activity perspective DeFi is consuming the lion's share of blockchain entrepreneurial creativity, innovation and sheer intensity in product introductions, to the point where keeping up with this segment has become extremely challenging, even to insiders.      Despite all this excitement and positivity surrounding it, DeFi is not on a good trajectory. DeFi users (just like its creators) are geeky. They are mostly crypto nerds or early adopters. For DeFi to thrive, it must enter the mainstream and attract users who do not tolerate nor understand DeFi’s geekiness.      Here’s why and how.    Where will users come from?    DeFi maximalists are dogmatic in believing that financial self-custody is enough to grow the segment. Unfortunately, there aren’t enough users who want to duke it out on DeFi’s user experience quirkiness.      The jargon itself is a deterrent: flash loans, yield farming, staking, liquidity pools, liquidity providers, slippage, bonding curve, vaults, money market as protocol, algorithmic market-making, credit delegation and so on. These aren’t subjects that will be understood by mainstream users, let alone by some financial experts.    The CeFi market potential is staring DeFi in the face.    You might be thinking: How about the new group of so-called “DeFi wallets”?      Yes, there is a new generation of self-custodial wallets that are bent on a self-proclaimed mission to attract millions of users to DeFi. The best of them have beautiful user interfaces. But they all have an intrinsically poor mainstream usefulness because they tilt on geekiness, and on the assumption that end-users are fully versed in DeFi concepts.      For the above reasons, I believe the best prospects for growing DeFi and ushering it into the mainstream is via central exchanges, or “CeFi.”      I recently conducted a Twitter poll asking the question of whether DeFi is infrastructure, middleware or end-user application? The majority of responses favored the proverbial “all of the above” answer.      As infrastructure, DeFi’s protocols provided a technical and functional base layer to build on.      As middleware, DeFi has seen a proliferation of APIs, open access points, interchangeable modular functionality (which DeFiers call “composability”) and a rich programmability potential.      As application, the wallet has become a popular entry point, mostly via the non-custodial type, arguably the least user-friendly flavor among typical crypto wallets.      These multiple personalities have helped disguise DeFi’s entrance. As a result, and with no concern for these blurred architectural lines, DeFi developed into a messy patchwork of products, services and technical capabilities all mushed-up as one.      Although initially acceptable, this messiness will eventually disappear as the segment matures. Eventually, these three architectural pieces will become discreetly disconnected and more clearly visible.    CeFi to the rescue    Here are three angles of attack that CeFi players can adopt in order to fully exploit the explosion of DeFi.      See also: Paul Brody – Enterprises Would Use DeFi, if It Weren’t so Public    Bring DeFi products inside exchanges    CeFi players have already built mainstream user experiences inside their exchanges. That was a key requirement for their success. Now, they must figure out how to integrate DeFi products and services into their offerings by gradually tucking them inside these known user experiences.      Binance, Huobi and Coinbase have already started to do some of that by listing DeFi tokens or creating baskets of DeFi indices, adding staking services, and introducing stablecoin-backed interest rates on top of staking services. These are all good but timid first steps, but nonetheless required ones.    Think like wholesale pickers    Long term, I see the various DeFi protocols as being the equivalent of “manufacturers,” with CeFi as the wholesalers that pick their products, integrate them and give them a retail face. CeFi players should hurry and pick the DeFi products they want to build on top of.      To do so, CeFi can focus on integrating DeFi from the middleware levels and providing their own user experiences, i.e. adding their own brand of lipstick on top of the DeFi tech.    Provide more education, not just great user experiences    As mentioned, many new crypto-wallets have gorgeous interfaces. But while necessary, that is not sufficient. What I am referring to is market education, not in-app tutorials and “how to do this” that quickly overwhelm mainstream users.      To quote the Japanese writer Haruki Murakami, “If you can't understand it without an explanation, you can't understand it with an explanation.”      See also: Galen Danzinger – In 2019, Students Demanded Blockchain Education. In 2020, It’s Coming      Market education will go a long way. The goal is to dumb down the DeFi entry points to mainstream levels of understanding such that the inner complexities are hidden so that the new benefits can emerge via a mainstream kind of wrapping.      You might think, how about traditional finance? What is its role? In my opinion, traditional finance players have higher hoops to jump through to integrate DeFi than CeFi players do.      Before DeFi can aspire to eat traditional finance, it needs to eat some CeFi first, maybe as the appetizer.      Another scenario might be to let DeFi grow from its own base while skirting around CeFi and OldFi (traditional finance). That plot has a lower likelihood of success and a greater difficulty level, judging by what we have seen so far from the DeFi players.      Some may think that going the CeFi route comes with risks of increased centralization powers in the hands of the big exchanges, but that is a lesser worry than to let DeFi meander its way into uncertain growth from a small base.      See also: DeFi Dad – Five Years In, DeFi Now Defines Ethereum      The CeFi market potential is staring DeFi in the face. If CeFi exchanges want to start looking more like full-service financial services institutions, they need to become DeFi’s best distribution channels.      I hope that both sides meet each other half-way to make this happen.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,William Mougayar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/02/for-defi-to-grow-cefi-must-embrace-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af94098f5e97f3d4a6e4ae128fe68c7f37bc9365-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384605,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkgTl,1599066194,Retail Trading Platforms Pile Into $5M Funding Round for Zero Hash Crypto Settlements Firm,"Three retail-orientated trading platforms have participated in the latest $4.75 million funding round for crypto trading infrastructure provider Zero Hash.    Zero Hash announced Wednesday it had completed its Series C funding round, which was led by tastyworks, the owner of app-based brokerage, tastytrade.  Other participants included another app-based broker-dealer Dough as well as Small Exchange, a futures market aimed at retail customers.  Existing investors including Bain Capital, brokerage firm TradeStation, CMT Digital and Monday Capital also participated in the round.  Zero Hash provides a settlement infrastructure for platforms, such as app-based brokerages, to offer cryptocurrency trading for their users.  A Form D filed by Zero Hash's parent, Seed CX, to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Tuesday shows $3.75 million had been raised – $1 million off the $4.75 million funding target.  But co-founder Edward Woodford told CoinDesk Wednesday that Zero Hash had, in fact, hit the $4.75 million raise amount.  In response to a question about how many retail-oriented trading platforms that invested in the latest round could wind up using Zero Hash's technology, Woodford said, ""Watch this space in particular for Dough and tastyworks announcements in the next two weeks.""  Indeed, Zero Hash already counts TradeStation, as well as several unnamed over-the-counter (OTC) groups as clients.  Seed CX launched in 2015 as a derivatives trading platform for exotic commodities, including cannabis, but pivoted into crypto in late 2017.  Initially a subsidiary, Seed CX, closed its exchange in June in order to focus on Zero Hash, as it brought in roughly 95% of total revenue.  Woodford said the company now trades exclusively under the name Zero Hash.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday charged Kentuckian John Brian McLane, Jr. and Floridian Paul Anthony Nash with defrauding victims of their personal development multilevel marketing company, Mindset 24.  Prosecutors say McLane and Nash sold Mindset 24's 735 investors on a promise of 70% returns powered by self-help kit sales, taking in over $1 million – mostly in bitcoin – during their 11-month run.

42384615,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkgdp,1599064015,Blockchain Bites: How SushiSwap Drove Uniswap to DeFi's Top Spot,"A South Korean crypto exchange has been raided by police, Bitcoin's Lightning Network hit a new high and mining revenues are climbing.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Full stack    Sushi/Uni There is a battle for dominance to become the top decentralized exchange in the DeFi space. Uniswap, a venture capital backed project, meant to create a more open and customizable crypto exchange, is being challenged by an upstart unaudited adaption called SushiSwap.      Part of a trend of “Weird DeFi” projects – frequently food-themed – SushiSwap’s emergence last week is doing bizarre things to the market.      Uniswap was already on a tare. The automated money market (AMM) platform saw its trading volume climb to $953.59 million on Tuesday – a more than ten-fold gain over the past month. Further, its 24-hour trading volume is now 50% higher than on Coinbase Pro, the largest U.S.-based centralized cryptocurrency exchange.      Uniswap’s usage has grown so rapidly that it’s taken over the top spot among fee payers on the Ethereum network. Traders on Uniswap have paid $5 million (10,805 ETH) in transaction fees in the past 24 hours.      Meanwhile, SushiSwap has already moved into the No. 3 spot of payers of Ethereum “gas,” the unit used to calculate fees on the Ethereum blockchain. It launched Aug. 28.      SushiSwap, which provides a near-identical function to Uniswap but rewards liquidity providers with sushi tokens and a share in trading fees, popularity comes from a unique marketing strategy: For roughly two weeks (100,000 blocks) ahead of launch, users who stake liquidity provider tokens from Uniswap to SushiSwap will get 10X the liquidity mining rewards.      Some speculate this incentive may be driving traffic to Uniswap. “DeFi degens can amass LP tokens, which they can dump immediately into Sushi and take advantage of this brief period of extremely generous SUSHI distribution,” CoinDesk’s Brady Dale elegantly said.    Top shelf    Mining revenues Bitcoin miners enjoyed a 23% increase in revenue during August, driven by higher network fees from increased on-chain transaction volume. Miners generated an estimated $368 million in revenue in August, up from $300 million in July, and the third consecutive monthly increase in miner revenue, according to Coin Metrics. Network fees brought in $39 million in August, or 10.7% of total revenue, setting the highest percentage of fee-generated revenue in over 18 months. Revenue estimates assume miners sell their bitcoins immediately.      Predictions or bust With the U.S. presidential election just months away, prediction markets should be booming but they’re not, CoinDesk’s Benjamin Powers and Brady Dale report. Prediction markets harness the wisdom of the crowd and induce experts to put skin in the game to discover what people really predict – and reflect crypto’s natural distrust of so-called authorities, the same ones that misjudged the last election. However, centralized markets like PredictIt are heavily regulated and charge high fees. Nascent decentralized prediction markets, which run on public blockchain networks, are sparsely used. And the ones that run on Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, now face high “gas” fees for users to run computations.      OneCoin fallout The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) is seeking to confiscate nearly $400 million from the attorney who helped accused crypto Ponzi scheme OneCoin launder hundreds of millions of dollars. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District called on the District Court judge responsible for sentencing Mark Scott – convicted last November – to impose a ""forfeiture money judgment,"" in a submission Monday. Between 2015 and 2018, Scott created a network of fake investment funds for OneCoin that laundered a total of $392,940,000 – the amount the DoJ is now seeking to reclaim. U.S. prosecutors have previously estimated that OneCoin took in more than $4 billion from investors through its cryptocurrency scheme – making it one of the most successful Ponzis ever.      Exchange raided South Korean authorities have reportedly seized Bithumb, one of the country’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume. The Seoul Newspaper reported Wednesday the police action was linked to a $25 million token sale hosted on Bithumb and a proposed acquisition by a Singapore platform, BTHMB, that never materialized. Some investors said they lost millions participating in the sale. Bithumb's chairman, Lee Jung-hoon, has been accused of fraud and illicitly sending funds overseas. Last week, police seized Coinbit – the country's third-largest exchange – on allegations it had faked most of its trading volumes.      Lightning speed? Bitcoin’s Lightning Network set a record high Monday as total capacity held in the protocol’s payment channels – sometimes referred to as “total value locked” (TVL) – reached $12.4 million. Two weeks ago, Lightning set the prior high of $12.37 million, surpassing the long-standing previous mark of $12.3 million that was reached in early July 2019 and lasted for 405 days. Further, the number of publicly broadcasting nodes has steadily increased to approximately 7,600 nodes, up 55% from January. The total number of bitcoins held on Lightning sits at 1,060, up 24% so far this year, but still remains below the record high of 1,105 BTC set in early May 2019, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reports.

CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen looks at a few common causes and solutions hard won in the crypto industry.      Deribit, a popular derivatives exchange that went dark in late August, has installed redundant load balancers and is setting up a disaster recovery facility in Switzerland. This is to address a hardware issue.      More frequently, it isn’t an issue with a masternode, but a simple code update that can trigger interruptions. Coinbase and Binance have both recently experienced this issue when a surge in trading volumes tested their limits.      Derivatives exchange FTX’s support team also told Shen that to reduce the risk of outages, their work has been concentrated on making sure enough spare capacity will be available to support the exchange’s operation during busy periods.      Another solution, circuit breakers, are quasi-controversial in crypto. First implemented on stock exchanges after the “Black Monday” crash in 1987, breakers automatically halt trading when prices fall below specified levels. They are designed to save the market from a complete meltdown.      Deribit has an index circuit breaker on its platform which is triggered at +/-1.5% index price move per second to “avoid massive sell-offs, and allow market participants to get up to speed with the market during highly volatile periods,” Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, said. These were triggered several times in March, during an intense period of market volatility.      Though there is a cost to installing circuit breakers, as evidenced by Binance’s outage that forced traders to competing platforms.      “These make a lot less sense,” FTX representatives said. “Rather than acting as a sanity check, they restrict users’ ability to trade and enforce artificial pricing.”      Ultimately, there is a tension between security and speed that exchanges need to balance. But the ethos running though Silicon Valley and crypto – move fast and break things – means exchange operators will likely prioritize liquidity and transaction fees rather than reducing outages.      “Is an uptime requirement of 99.999% something that the same type of people who invented Robinhood are going to aspire to?” Dave Weisberger, co-founder and CEO of execution provider CoinRoutes, said. “The answer is no. They say they aspire to it but that’s very expensive. … As a result, there are outages.”    Market intel    Bitcoin blues Bitcoin is facing selling pressure at press time, having failed to move above a long-held resistance level on Tuesday. The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading near $11,390, representing a roughly 4% decline on the day, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Bulls failed to establish a foothold above the $12,000 mark on Tuesday, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports, the fourth time in the past five weeks. Immediate support is located at $11,170; a violation there would confirm a bearish head-and-shoulders breakdown.    Tech pod    CBDC wallet The roll-out of China’s central bank digital currency may include hardware wallets as well, CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhou reports. Over the weekend, China Construction Bank (CCB), one of the country’s big-four state-owned commercial banks, opened up a wallet service to public users within its mobile app for testing China’s CBDC, also known as DC/EP. The wallet’s Terms and Services showed that a hardware wallet – akin to an actual wallet for cash – may also be in the works. The DC/EP hardware wallets can be traceable and would strip off the anonymity feature of paper cash as users would need personal information such as IDs and phone numbers to activate the wallet in the first place.      Wallet malware A new malware, called Anubis, can target cryptocurrency wallets and other sensitive data, according to a Microsoft Security Intelligence report. On sale on the darkweb since June, experts recommend not visiting sketchy websites or opening strange or suspicious attachments, links or emails, CoinDesk’s Benjamin Powers reports. Importantly, this malware is distinct from a family of Android banking malware also called Anubis. It joins a growing list of malwares that look for vulnerable cryptocurrency stashes.    Op-ed    Crypto shortages? J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist and author of Moneyness, thinks people who don’t consider crypto to be money need to look at the coin shortage in the U.S., where money is failing to be money. “There can never be shortages of digital versions of the dollar because tokens flow rapidly over the internet, not slowly via hand,” he writes.

This is possibly due to yield farming, the act of putting crypto holdings to work on decentralized applications to earn more crypto.    Options open interest, or contracts traded but not liquidated by an offsetting trade, rose to a record high of $507 million on Deribit on Tuesday, surpassing the previous record high of $438 million reached on Aug. 20, according to data source Skew.  ""The key driver for the phenomenal growth has been the recent DeFi success,"" Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of Deribit, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  ""Many clients have been farming yield using stablecoins, which are bought by selling ether and buying ether call options (bullish bets) to keep the upside potential in the second-largest cryptocurrency,"" Strijers added.  Open positions in ether options have surged by 45% from $349 million to $507 million over the past five days and nearly doubled since the end of July.  The total value locked (TVL) in the DeFi applications has surged by over 20% to $8.65 billion in the past five days. Also, TVL has more than doubled in the past four weeks, according to defipulse.com.  Data suggests that the yield farming frenzy has boosted the ether options open interest.  That said, it is also possible that some investors might have just bought calls, anticipating a strong price rally. Ether rose to two-year highs near $480 on Tuesday.

42384608,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkga3,1599062280,Newly Discovered Malware Has Arsenal of Tricks to Help It Steal Crypto,"An advanced form of cryptocurrency-targeting malware shared through pirated software and games downloaded from torrent sites poses multiple threats to victims.    In a report Wednesday, researchers at Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET said they had found malicious code within the installer program for media files that contains a cryptocurrency mining bot.  Once downloaded, the hidden app starts its mining bot to hijack computer power and mine monero, as well as ether if a GPU card is detected.  However, the malware has evolved in its two years of existence to possess other tricks that are more concerning to users of cryptocurrency.  Dubbed ""KryptoCibule"" – a combination of the Czech and Slovak words for ""cryptocurrency"" and ""onion"" – the malware can also change a wallet address to one linked to the hacker when pasted from the clipboard, potentially diverting funds sent to the victim.  Further, it will hunt for, and steal, cryptocurrency passwords, private keys or key phrases stored on the host machine's hard drive.  The malware is spread by users sharing the affected media files on peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.  It also updates itself using BitTorrent, which was acquired by Tron in mid-2018, the researchers said.  ESET said KryptoCibule had stolen roughly $1,800 in bitcoin and ether by changing victims' wallet addresses.  They were unable to determine how much the hacker stole through the mining bot or from stealing passwords.  KryptoCibule likely started operation in late 2018 but has remained hidden till now thanks to being designed to evade detection.  KryptoCibules hides in files that work normally, so victims are less likely to suspect anything amiss. It also actively watches for, and hides from, antivirus tools such as Avast.  In addition, it contains a command line to the Tor browser that encrypts communications and makes it impossible to trace the mining server behind KryptoCibule.  KryptoCibule also monitors the computer's battery so it doesn't consume too much power and thus get noticed.

While three individuals have been arrested so far for their alleged involvement with the attack, authorities are now looking at a 16-year-old Massachusetts resident who is thought to have ties with Graham Clark, the 17-year-old Florida man state prosecutors allege to be the ringleader of the group, people involved in the ongoing investigation told the Times.

The Times didn't identify the suspect because of his age.   Citing the people involved with the probe, the report said the 16-year-old came into investigators’ focus because he allegedly continued to be involved with voice phishing attacks even after the attack on Twitter.   According to the report, the teenager met Clark online and in May, it’s alleged, they both started tricking Twitter employees into revealing their login details, which helped them carry out July’s breach.

Announced Wednesday, Toronto-based Coinberry has acquired a financial institution bond, a requirement for registration with its provincial securities regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission.    The move is a concrete example of a general tightening of regulationhttps://www.iiroc.ca/documents/2019/196069ad-9053-4d8b-8022-a8e11a6c4385_en.pdf in Canada, particularly in the wake of the Quadriga debacle.    “Every Canadian crypto user remembers Quadriga and the impact of that is still fresh in the back of their minds,” said Coinberry CEO Andrei Poliakov. “People still have to trust exchanges and platforms to use crypto and the investment on Coinberry’s part protects against the corrupt human element that has struck the personal finances of many Canadians.”      Read more: Gerald Cotten: Mystery Man      In the U.S., surety bonds of this type, which provide insurance in case of dishonest or fraudulent acts by employees, have been a requirement for crypto firms to be registered with FinCEN for some time.      However, to qualify as a money service business in Canada with its version of FinCEN, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) – with which Coinberry is already registered – does not require a financial institution bond.      In this respect, Poliakov believes “wholeheartedly” that Coinberry is the first crypto firm to go the extra mile.      “We applied for registration with the OSC and we’ve been going through that process for quite some time,” said Poliakov. “One of the requirements was to have our financial statements publicly audited, by MNP in this case, and another requirement was to have a financial institution bond in place.”      Read more: Canadian Municipality Set to Accept Bitcoin for Property Tax Payments      Coinberry’s surety bond is underwritten by the Lloyd’s of London insurance market and the coverage limit is CAD$1,000,000 ($764,000) per claim/incident, said Poliakov.      Neither Lloyd’s nor the OSC returned requests for comment by press time.      There may well be other crypto firms in the process of going through the registration process with the OSC, Poliakov said, adding that a general clampdown when it comes to crypto compliance has seen Ontario regulators blocking firms that don’t play ball. Last week, BitMEX was blocked from serving Ontario-based customers.      “I cannot speak to whether the others in Canada are in the process of getting this,” Poliakov said in a follow-up email. “I do know some platforms are not applying at all, while others (like BitMEX) have already received instructions from the OSC to cease operation in Ontario because they are not going the registration route.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/02/coinberry-crypto-exchange-gets-lloyds-cover-as-canadas-post-quadriga-rules-tighten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3294a20de8e59944e38959c93cce6a355a9bb235-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Wednesday, Shyft’s Veriscope Governance Task Force includes recent joiners Binance and Bitfury, as well as a globally distributed collection of crypto firms such as BCW, HashKey Pro, Tokocrypto, Unocoin, Paycase Financial and CoinHako.      Shyft, a well-known participant in the race to bring crypto in line with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) AML regulations, last year hired heavyweight advisers Rick McDonell (former FATF executive secretary) and Josee Nadeau (former head of the Canadian delegation to the FATF). The two will co-chair the governance task force.      “Veriscope intends to provide a governance and rules framework whereby virtual asset service providers [VASPs] can trust each other,” McDonell said in an interview. “It keeps them in a democratic environment in terms of making rules and, because of the transparency between them, allows firms to take the risk of sharing information that could at times be commercially competitive.”      Read more: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule      In June 2019, the FATF issued guidance requiring VASPs to share know-your-customer (KYC) data between a transacting originator (sender of funds) and a beneficiary (receiver). This personally identifiable information (PII) must “travel” concurrently with digital asset transfers of over $1,000.      In order not to simply rebuild SWIFT, a 50-year-old interbank messaging system, the industry has to think about onboarding and governance frameworks, said Shyft co-founder Joseph Weinberg.      “The one thing that you can’t get away from is you still need to onboard the VASP to the network,” Weinberg said. “It’s really about defining the onboarding governance framework, an open mandate for the best practices for any VASP that has to join into the network. What are the rules?”      Despite the fact crypto was specifically designed to be pseudonymous, the industry has responded energetically with an array of technical solutions and a universally agreed-upon messaging standard.

Another key area here is interoperability, Weinberg said; “Everyone’s talking about it,” he added, but it should be governed by the exchanges rather than protocol teams.      No firm should be precluded from accessibility but VASPs globally should be given the tools and provided with a baseline to determine how counterparties are expected to share information with counterparties, said Weinberg.      “It’s an inclusive working team that’s open to any other VASPs to join,” Weinberg said of the Veriscope effort. “It’s for the users of the system.

The move lower pushed the largest cryptocurrency back toward the middle of its range over the past month, between roughly $10,500 and $12,400.      Mati Greenspan, founder of the digital-asset and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, put a positive spin on bitcoin's recent performance in a note to clients on Tuesday.      ""One can't help but wonder whether the underperformance of bitcoin in this market is actually a further sign of it moving toward being considered a safe-haven asset,"" Greenspan wrote. ""If all the risk assets are outperforming, then surely the property of stability should count for something.""    Market Moves    Trading volumes are surging on Uniswap and other so-called decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, challenging established venues like Coinbase while driving up fees and congestion on the Ethereum blockchain.      Uniswap, a semi-automated platform for matching buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, saw its trading volume climb to $953.59 million on Tuesday, a more than ten-fold gain over the past month, according to the website uniswap.info. The 24-hour trading volume has crossed above $1 billion – at least 50% higher than daily trading volumes observed on Coinbase Pro, the largest U.S.-based centralized cryptocurrency exchange.      The rise of decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, represents a new chapter of this year’s boom in decentralized finance. The fast-growing ecosystem, known as DeFi, consists of automatic lending and trading platforms, built atop distributed computing networks like Ethereum and constructed from open-source software and programmable cryptocurrencies. They aim to provide more efficient and less costly ways of conducting transactions currently handled by banks and traditional exchanges.      “It indicates that the DeFi flippening is real and already here,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “Flippening” is crypto jargon, used loosely to indicate the hypothetical moment when one blockchain or digital-asset trend overtakes another.      Read More: DeFi Flippening Comes to Exchanges as Uniswap Topples Coinbase in Trading Volume      -Omkar Godbole    Meanwhile, traditional market exchanges are struggling with outages long familiar to their crypto counterparts.    Both crypto exchanges and popular online trading platforms including Schwab, TD Ameritrade and Robinhood have a rising number of young investors who, working from home during the coronavirus pandemic, spend some of their work hours trading for their own personal accounts.      These platforms have another thing in common: outages in the midst of high volume.      On Monday, login issues were reported from customers on Robinhood, along with a few other similar trading platforms including giants TD Ameritrade and Schwab. The outage was allegedly caused by the stock splits of Apple and Tesla. Silicon Valley-based Robinhood was the subject of more than 400 complaints reported to U.S. regulators during the first half of 2020.      Like traditional platforms, crypto exchanges have been troubled by outages for a long time, even after they pledge to take more steps to improve stability and reduce outages. These mainstream companies may be able to learn something from the experience of crypto exchanges.      One main cause of outages at crypto exchanges is hardware failure, and the solution is to build in redundancy, Dave Weisberger, co-founder and CEO of execution provider CoinRoutes, told CoinDesk in a phone interview. By now, most exchanges have built fully redundant systems, he said, and as a result any outages caused by hardware failures are usually short-lived.      The other cause, more common, is a change in a new piece of code that was not thoroughly tested. Bugs in the new code can be triggered at a later time by an unplanned situation such as a surge in trading volumes, resulting in an outage.      “Building software which scales to serve so many users is really hard, and the operational work to make sure servers stay up and running is quite difficult,” Tushar Jain, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, told CoinDesk in a Twitter direct message.

""Corrective pressures are giving the greenback a reprieve,"" according to Marc Chandler, a former chief currency strategist for the giant British bank HSBC.  The dollar is most oversold in 40 years and could continue to gain altitude in the short-term, keeping bitcoin under pressure.  The cryptocurrency's technical charts are also signaling scope for temporary pullback.  Bitcoin's repeated rejection above $12,000 observed over the past four weeks is suggestive of bull fatigue.

The new BRIE think tank will bring together a gaggle of European industry leaders, academics, policymakers, entrepreneurs and researchers, according to a joint press statement.      The goal: Getting large companies through the “trough of disillusionment” currently surrounding “enterprise blockchain.”      “We were not focused on what is typically called enterprise blockchain,” Alex Tapscott said in an interview. “I think that’s just a misnomer.”      Instead, BRI is focused on “blockchain for enterprise,” which offers a wider canvas on which distributed technologies can play out.      “Saying ‘enterprise blockchain’ is like saying ‘enterprise internet.’ There’s just one internet,” Tapscott said. “From the very beginning, we saw public protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum as being the foundation technology that would be used by enterprises.”      Read more: Salesforce Among 12 New Members to Join Blockchain Research Institute      One particular area of growth: stablecoins.      “Stablecoins were never part of the enterprise blockchain toolkit until recently,” he said. “From first-hand experience talking to banks, supply chain, shipping and logistics companies, all of them are trying to understand how the stablecoin boom is going to transform enterprise.”      Tapscott said BRIE’s aim is to recruit large European corporates to join the BRI consortium, which includes mainly U.S. member firms like FedEx, Exxon, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, IBM and Microsoft.

The fast-growing ecosystem, known as DeFi, consists of automatic lending and trading platforms built atop distributed computing networks like Ethereum and constructed from open-source software and programmable cryptocurrencies. They aim to provide more-efficient and less-costly ways of conducting transactions currently handled by banks and traditional exchanges.      ""It indicates that the DeFi flippening is real and already here,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “Flippening” is crypto jargon, used loosely to indicate the hypothetical moment when one blockchain or digital-asset trend overtakes another.      Uniswap’s usage has grown so rapidly that it’s taken over the top spot among fee payers on the Ethereum network, where most of the DeFi development is taking place. The total value locked in the DeFi applications, the most common metric for measuring the activity, has increased 13-fold this year to about $9.2 billion, according to the data-tracking website Defi Pulse.      Uniswap has now moved into the top spot in total value locked, at $1.7 billion, CoinDesk reported Tuesday, while overall decentralized exchange volumes nearly tripled in August to $11.6 billion from July levels.      “As DeFi assets approach $10 billion, one narrative we may see is that crypto is a completely separate, new sphere of economics and finance,” according to a blog post Tuesday by Fintech Blueprint, curated by Lex Sokolin of the Ethereum-focused developer ConsenSys. “It does not need to connect to the old world. It simply needs to be left alone to perform.”      Traders on Uniswap have paid $5 million (10,805 ETH) in transaction fees in the past 24 hours, according to data source etherscan.io. That's more than double the amount paid for transfers of the dollar-linked stablecoin tether (USDT), which had been the top contributor, according to ethgasstation.info.      Uniswap is designed to be more customizable than centralized exchanges like Coinbase. Instead of listing specific assets available for trading on the platform, traders can choose and list the tokens they want to transact in; currently the platform boasts more than 6,020.      And SushiSwap, a five-day-old unaudited project that’s an adaptation of Uniswap, has already moved into to the No. 3 spot of payers of Ethereum “gas,” which is the unit used to calculate fees for token transfers on the Ethereum blockchain.      Sushiswap, which went live on Aug. 28, pays out rewards to liquidity providers in its tokens – ticker SUSHI – in addition to a share of trading fees.      There’s already $81 million of liquidity for sushi on Uniswap, and the 24-hour trading volume of $151.42 million exceeds that of spot-market cryptocurrency trading volumes on mid-tier exchanges like Binance US, Gemini and Poloniex.      The “fear of missing out” on SUSHI reveals the “the DeFi craze,” according to a report Tuesday from the Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm Arcane Research.      Press officials for Coinbase, which is reportedly considering an initial public stock offering, didn’t respond to a request for comment.      DeFi has grown so quickly that centralized exchanges from Binance to FTX have rushed to roll out indexes – and new trading contracts like futures and perpetual swaps linked to those indexes – to give investors a way to bet on the industry segment’s growth.      But, according to Vinokourov, DEXs might represent a more existential threat to the centralized exchanges.      “Those already trading on DEXs fully realize that growth will only accelerate,"" Vinokourov told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | UNI | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/02/defi-flippening-comes-to-exchanges-as-uniswap-topples-coinbase-in-trading-volume,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20146f5998e908d072e1190dea5722aa697ae4b4-1400x889.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422117,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKnHS,1599041575,US Moves to Seize $400M From Convicted OneCoin Money Launderer,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) is seeking to confiscate nearly $400 million from the attorney who helped accused crypto Ponzi scheme OneCoin launder hundreds of millions of dollars.    The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York asked the U.S. District Court judge responsible for sentencing Mark Scott – convicted last November – to impose a ""forfeiture money judgment,"" in a submission Monday.  Between 2015 and 2018, Scott created a network of fake investment funds for OneCoin that laundered a total of $392,940,000 – the amount the DoJ is now seeking to reclaim.  These entities received funds from a series of shell corporations, ostensibly investors, that were actually linked to OneCoin.  The money was then transferred out as loans that were not repaid or wired to a series of bank accounts, some linked directly to OneCoin founder, Ruja Ignatova – who disappeared in late 2017.  As payment, Scott transferred $50 million to himself.  U.S. prosecutors have previously estimated that OneCoin took in more than $4 billion from investors through its cryptocurrency scheme – making it one of the most successful Ponzis ever.  Scott was found guilty last year on one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud.  Per Monday's submission, the DoJ wants to freeze Scott's assets until he has forfeited the near $400 million sum he laundered for OneCoin.  If approved by the court, the U.S. government will be able to confiscate funds and assets, as well as any other property Scott owns, until the amount has been satisfied.  This would include several seaside villas, sports cars, jewelry, watches and a yacht that he purchased with proceeds from OneCoin.  He would also face losing control of the bank accounts that he used to launder OneCoin's funds.  Scott faces a prison term of up to 50 years when he's sentenced on Oct. 9.

42422124,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKnhI,1599037403,Ethereum Classic Labs Airs New Plan to Stop Future 51% Attacks,"The leading organization supporting the Ethereum Classic network hopes to better safeguard against future 51% attacks by going after platforms that rent out hashing power.    In a Medium post on Tuesday, Ethereum Classic Labs singled out crypto-mining marketplace NiceHash for allegedly facilitating multiple attacks against the network.  The firm said it would take ""all steps necessary to secure the Ethereum Classic network,"" including pursuing ""legal action against those who conduct or facilitate malicious attacks.""  It also plans to bring in law enforcement and engage global regulators to provide ""accountability"" and ""transparency"" for hash rentals.  Malicious actors are claimed to have repeatedly purchased hashrate (computer processing power on the network) from the NiceHash marketplace to execute the so-called 51% attacks.  A 51% attack on a proof-of-work blockchain occurs when an actor manages to take control of the majority of the network's hashrate (that is, 51% or more) enabling that person to reorganize (or rewrite) transactions.  Ethereum Classic has been hit by three such attacks in the last month, resulting in millions of dollars' worth of its cryptocurrency (ETC) being double spent.  ETC Labs said is already working with authorities in ""relevant jurisdictions,"" adding that it will share more information as it becomes available.  NiceHash is no stranger to controversy, with its former chief financial officer and co-founder Matjaz Skorjanec having been arrested in Germany in late 2019 following U.S. charges that he ran the cybercrime forum Darkode.  After the first two of the recent attacks caused hashrate to plummet, ETC Labs said in late August it was implementing ""a defensive mining strategy"" to try and keep levels more consistent.  While the exact details of the strategy were not revealed at the time due to confidentiality, the initiative failed to stop the third attack.  The lower the hashrate of a network, the more easy (and affordable) it is to attack.  ETC's hashrate has now dropped to its lowest point in over three years – around 1.56 TH/s, according to Ethereum Classic Explorer.  CoinDesk reached out to ETC Labs for more information on its new legal plan, but had not had a reply by press time.

According to a Tuesday press statement by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), 26-year-old Bryan Connor Herrell received an 11-year prison term from U.S District Court Judge Dale Drozd.  Herrell was responsible for settling disputes between vendors and consumers concerning trades in illicit goods such as drugs and guns, often paid for using bitcoin.  He was also responsible for monitoring attempts to defraud users of the darknet marketplace and operated under the monikers ""Penissmith"" and ""Botah.""  ""This sentence serves as further proof criminals cannot hide behind technology,"" said U.S. Attorney McGregor Scott.  People should think again before buying or selling drugs online: ""You will be caught,"" Scott said.  Prior to being shut down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in July 2017, AlphaBay was a popular marketplace for illicit items including stolen identities, credit cards and narcotics.  In February, 36-year-old Ohio resident Larry Dean Harmon, former CEO of Coin Ninja, was charged by U.S. law enforcement with laundering more than $300 million in bitcoin for AlphaBay.  Harmon's family denied he was ever involved directly with AlphaBay, with his brother claiming the marketplace used Harmon's cryptocurrency mixer Helix without his consent or input.  Mixers allow users to obfuscate the source of a cryptocurrency payment by outputting different coins than are sent.  Alphabay users traded using cryptocurrency like bitcoin because payments are outside the banking system and are semi-anonymous.  However, transactions are traceable on most blockchains and can ultimately be used by law enforcement to link criminals to their activities.
