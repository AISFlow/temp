42377119,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6z8WP,1397253074,Robotic Charlie Shrem Appearance Unlikely at Toronto Bitcoin Expo,"Bitcoin Expo 2014, the Toronto-based bitcoin exhibition organised by the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, started today (11th April) and will run through the weekend.  However, one of the most promising parts of the show - a disembodied Charlie Shrem that was rumored to be appearing via a sophisticated robotic device - seemed unlikely to materialise at press time.  While seemingly far-fetched, the unconventional conference appearance would have followed Shrem's Skype-based appearance at the Texas Bitcoin Conference in Austin earlier this year.  The event, taking place over three days, brings together bitcoin speakers from across the globe. One of the prevailing themes will be the development of next-generation digital currencies, said organiser Anthony Di Iorio  Di Iorio told CoinDesk:  ""There has been a shift to the next generation of cryptocurrency. A lot of the talks are moving beyond the bitcoin space into what we can expect in the future.""  He cited Mastercoin, Open Transactions and the as-yet unlaunched Ethereum as examples, before adding:  ""I think quite a few talks will be about what's to come in the decentralised application space.""  Hackathon entrants woo investors  To this end, there is a hackathon focusing on decentralised applications and next-generation digital currency sponsored by bitcoin angel investment group BitAngels.  The hackathon is a good place for development teams who want to get in front of investors. BitAngels counted 50,000 bitcoins between its angels last year, but has just launched its first 10,000 bitcoin structured fund. The firm had already invested $7m in bitcoin startups as of January.  Di Iorio also has his own accelerator, and is hoping to pick up some candidates for his first cohort this weekend.  ""We think that hackathons are an amazing way to get teams together. We will do a lot of those in the future.""  The conference is designed to have a community feel, added Di Iorio. He said that the bitcoin conference which most impressed him in the past was the Argentinian bitcoin conference.  He explained:  ""It was a community-driven event, with people driven by monetary strangleholds. It was a passionate community with people risking their safety. Speakers were in a tight group and it was a good community feel. That's what the goal of this one will be.""  Di Iorio dismissed suggestions that Inside Bitcoins, the New York-based show held earlier this week, may have cast a shadow on his own. ""I believe we have some of the best community speaker lists,"" he said. ""People are extremely excited about our event more than Inside Bitcoins.""  The speaker list is star-studded. For example, Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer at Blockchain.info and a luminary in the bitcoin space, will act as emcee.  Surprise Shrem appearance unlikely  At publication, it seemed unlikely that one of the most fun parts of the conference had happened.  Charlie Shrem, the former CEO of now-defunct bitcoin buying and selling service BitInstant, had been negotiating with a company that makes robotic videoconferencing avatars, designed to give someone a mobile virtual presence.  Shrem is now under house arrest, but the plan was to have Shrem's robot - effectively a motor carrying around a display on a stalk - travel the show and speak to people remotely.  Earlier this week, Shrem said that he was negotiating with a company to make it happen, but that staff were nervous about being represented by someone ""in a legal bind such as myself"".  Shrem failed to return inquiries about the plan later this week, and Di Iorio said that he hadn't heard back about going forward with the proposal.

The Cyprus Mail  reported that an arrest warrent has been issued for Brewster, who earlier this month was reportedly accused of defrauding customers.  The embattled CEO has been named as a ""person of interest"" in an investigation of the troubled Cyprus-based bitcoin savings and payment network, and three formal fraud charges have been filed against Brewster, law enforcement sources told the media outlet.  Police may also issue a European warrant for Brewster's arrest.  Trouble grows for Neo & Bee  Neo & Bee is at the center of a growing controversy after its CEO abruptly departed the country earlier this month, reportedly seeking investment to keep the company afloat. Brewster, however, indicated that he would not return following allegations that threats were targeted at his daughter.  The statements by Brewster followed allegations from two customers that they paid €15,000 and €20,000, respectively, for bitcoins they never received.  Problems for Neo & Bee first began when questions regarding the company's solvency were first raised earlier this month.  Neo & Bee's future uncertain  Neo & Bee first opened to a good deal of enthusiasm in the community, with some commentators hailing the opening of the bank-like company as a step forward for popular acceptance of digital currencies.  These problems worsened when tradeable shares for LMB Holdings, the company that owns Neo & Bee, plunged in value on the Havelock Investment exchange.  Brewster, whose exact location is unknown, has said in the past that he plans to sell his equity in the company. It remains unclear whether or not the arrest warrant will change the calculus of any sale of his stake.

42377126,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6z8ch,1397248860,Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges Prepare to Move Operations Overseas,"Major China-based bitcoin exchanges Huobi and OKCoin are reporting that they have received word from banking partners indicating that certain deposit services would be terminated by 14th April.  The news follows the 10th April statements issued by BTCTrade, BTC100 and Huobi confirming that they had bank accounts terminated by financial partners. OKCoin was previously contacted by a third-party payment processor, which prompted it to stop servicing deposits via prepaid voucher with this partner on 2nd April.  While the two new announcements brought news of more account freezes, they were perhaps most notable as they illustrated that major China-based exchanges are already looking to put in place contingency plans to maintain operations should the PBOC decide to further restrict its state-backed financial service providers from interacting with the industry.  Huobi indicated in its post that it is ""actively developing business cooperations with onshore financial institutions"", and that it has ""reached agreements with many institutions to ensure that Huobi can have normal RMB deposits and withdrawals"".  The exchange also implied it is open to continuing operations outside China, stating:  ""Huobi has already registered for and opened overseas incorporation and offshore accounts, and can use them at any time.""  Similarly, OKCoin offered a two-point restructuring plan in its post that included the potential for opening an overseas website designed to provide a ""more stable, more secure trading platform"", which it suggested is currently under construction.  The announcements provide the latest evidence that the original rumours of enhanced restrictions first reported by Caixin on 27th March will come to pass.  No official documentation received  Though the exchange received new notices, neither provided any hard evidence as to the change in PBOC policy.  Huobi's statement notes:  ""No bank branch has received official documents requesting the termination of business relationships with bitcoin exchanges"".  Its statement continued, explaining why information from major China-based exchanges has not been consistent in recent weeks.  ""Each bank's interpretation and execution of the policy is different, and so it may be that the current situation is an over(ly careful) reading of the policies by the authorities, and so it is not necessarily the case that all banks will stop business with bitcoin exchanges.""  More details  OKCoin released its statement on 6:00 GMT confirming that it had received oral notice from China Merchants Bank that its deposit services would be terminated.  Huobi's statement followed shortly thereafter at 9:00 GMT, and stated that China Merchants Bank had requested to terminate the exchanges withdrawal services by 14th April.  Said Huobi in an online post:  ""User withdrawals will not be affected, and Huobi will announce immediately any additional news.""  OKCoin said withdrawals were not affected either, and that its other bank accounts were still active. In addition, it offered a plan for how it will continue operations, using a recharge code, or voucher, service for deposits and withdrawals.  Users would be able to use the recharge service to withdraw yuan, before transferring the code. There is no fee for withdrawals or deposits to code. These codes can then be traded among exchange users.  The exchange also continued its optimistic outlook, stating:  ""We believe firmly that policy adjustment won't make China Bitcoin decline, but [provide] a test for exchange platforms.""  Huobi issues warning to PBOC  Of the two responses, Huobi's was perhaps the best at putting the events in general context, stating that it believes the PBOC is tightening restrictions due to concerns about money laundering and the security of its domestic financial system.  The statement suggested that the PBOC should be careful not to force its exchanges to close down or relocate abroad, arguing that exchanges would be the easiest points in the system to regulate.  Read the statement:  ""If online trading platforms that are following the rules have to stop services, bitcoin transactions will go offline where they will be unmonitored, and will result in even more difficulty regulating.""  The news follows the 11th April statements made by PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan, who said that the central bank will not ban bitcoin despite its latest policy shift.

42377121,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6z8Yv,1397243377,Fear of Russian Ban Caused Bitcoin Moscow Conference Cancellation,"The Bitcoin Moscow Conference, originally planned for 23rd March, was postponed indefinitely last month.  Though recent reports suggest Russia is still evaluating how to regulate bitcoin, fears that the country has enacted a bitcoin ban caused the event's ultimate delay.  Nikita Andriyanov, one of the conference organisers, told CoinDesk:  ""[A] huge part of sponsors, partners and speakers refused to participate, referring to [the] situation in Russia with bitcoin and even with Crimea.""  But, organisers remain positive about the future, and are waiting for the situation to turn around.  In February, the Russian central bank advised against using digital currencies, a stance that was soon expanded on by the Prosecutor General’s Office in a statement citing Russian Article 27 of Russia’s Federal Law:  “The official Russian currency is the ruble. The use of any other monetary instruments or surrogates is forbidden.”  The agency issued additional warnings about the dangers of bitcoin in a report that suggested the use of digital currencies in drug purchases, money laundering, international crime and terrorism.  The efficacy of the ban  A few things should be noted. Russia did not legally “ban” Bitcoin.  The statement issued can be interpreted as a position of digital currencies relative to the legal framework. What it said can be understood as ""bitcoin is not welcome"", as Russia to date has not taken any definitive steps toward implementing the ban.  Many media outlets reported on the “ban,” but today you can still buy bitcoins in Russia without any issues.  Russians still like bitcoin  Similar to the conference postponed just one month earlier, Bitcoin Conference Russia is scheduled for 23rd April.  Conference coordinator Natalie Gavrilenko said that although the Bank of Russia's statement dealt them a blow, there is still big interest in Russia. Trading bitcoins is not forbidden, she said, and the topics that will be discussed are within legal limits. To ease fears, participants will be allowed to remain anonymous.  On the future of digital currencies, Gavrilenko said:  “It is very hard to say. One who controls the information, controls the world.”  The political landscape of Russia and Ukraine  A lot has changed since February, however.  The political balance in Eastern Europe is shattered. The ousting of former Ukranian president Viktor Yanukovych sent waves across the region; Crimea seceded and joined Russia, and currently, there is large unrest in parts of Ukraine that have a minority Russian population.  The situation in Ukraine remains fragile, but the hope is that it will soon be stabilized. Talks between major parties will take place next week. Gavrilenko said another bitcoin conference in Kiev is forthcoming, but in the meantime, the Central Bank of Ukraine has limited the amount of money that can be converted to foreign currency.  Such restrictive policy comes as a consequence of increased demand, considering the political instability. The past shows that black markets form when the state does not provide services. Will bitcoin become another case?  Digital currencies and proponents of change may find themselves in the midst of a political confrontation between global superpowers. When considering sanctions, bitcoin could become an alternative currency, an event that could put it in the crosshairs of big players.  The conversations amongst people in Russia are ambiguous. With so many unknown variables in the giant unsolved equation that Russia is, only time will tell the future.

42377114,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6z8Sd,1397240449,Survey Results: 25% of Bitcoin Merchants Enjoy 10% Sales Boost,"This is Part Two of a three-part series aimed at learning more about the merchants who accept bitcoin and support the wider digital currency ecosystem.  The results are based on a survey issued 17th March that received more than 200 responses. Part One of this series sought to better define the merchants who are taking part in the bitcoin ecosystem.  In the first installment of our merchant survey, we uncovered that the majority - 59% - of merchants are accepting bitcoin to better support the bitcoin ecosystem. However, the bigger takeaway from this statistic is that the main driver of bitcoin adoption is not its cost-cutting benefits when compared to traditional financial tools.  While bitcoin benefits from adding like-minded merchants to the ecosystem, the true expansion of bitcoin as a currency and payment method will likely rest on convincing those who may not believe fully in bitcoin's underlying political motivations and ideology.  As such, it's arguable that the most important question when it comes to merchant expansion is, if the savings bitcoin provides isn't a major factor: Do merchants that accept bitcoin see a sales increase for doing so? And if so, do they make enough to convince those who might have reservations about joining the movement?  To date, we know that major retailers are achieving this result. Online retail giant Overstock topped $1m in sales in just under two months of accepting bitcoin, and TigerDirect followed suit, passing this milestone in a similar timeframe.  What isn't clear, though, is if smaller and mid-size merchants are achieving similar results.  In Part Two of this series, we’ll seek to examine more broadly how merchants are accepting bitcoin and what their success to date has been.  25% attribute more than 10% of their monthly sales to bitcoin  In total, our survey found that 24.5% - or roughly one-fourth - of respondents indicated that more than 10% of monthly sales are attributable to bitcoin purchases.  It's important to note that an unknown number of these respondents are likely bitcoin-only businesses, but that we do know that some merchants are achieving similar results even when accepting fiat currency.  The majority of merchants (56%), however, say that bitcoin is attributable to 0% to 2% of their total monthly sales.        Percentage of Monthly Sales Attributable to Bitcoin | CoinDesk      The graph also shows that about one-fifth of merchants see a sales increase of between 3% and 10%,      Though, it should be noted that Part One of our survey showed half of respondents have only been accepting bitcoin for under three months, meaning this figure may be due to the initial bump in sales most merchants report.    44% say it's 'very easy' to accept bitcoin    The survey also asked merchants to rate how difficult it was to start accepting bitcoin, and in the process debunked a long-standing myth that accepting bitcoin is an onerous process.      Overall, 42.7% said it was 'very easy' to begin accepting bitcoin, while an additional 35.39% said it was 'easy'. Just 1.12% reported that it was 'difficult' to begin accepting the digital currency.          How Difficult Was it to Start Accepting Bitcoin? | CoinDesk      On a scale of one to 10, with 10 representing the highest difficulty, respondents, on average, reported that accepting bitcoin had a difficulty level of 2.    44% use BitPay    Our survey also sought to examine which business partners are most popular for merchants, and revealed BitPay to be the clear frontrunner in the market, capturing 44% of the vote.      Coinbase came in second with 36% of the total vote, while the standard-issue Bitcoin-QT wallet came in third in terms of total responses.      Smaller percentages were observed for merchant processors GoCoin and BIPS.

Washington, DC USA  Surrounded by reporters and camera crews from some of the world's largest news organisations, more than 50 members of the US Congress lined up in Rayburn House on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC to test a Robocoin ATM.  Presented by Robocoin's management team at the invitation of Representative Jared Polis (D-CO), the Robocoin machine received an enthusiastic response from other members.  Polis said:  ""The innovation of online currency will be an important economic driver for the future that allows people and companies to reduce transaction costs and facilitate international transactions.""

Charleston, SC, USA  Another US Robocoin appeared in Charleston, South Carolina, at the Dig South Interactive Technology Festival. This machine comes courtesy of company Southeast Bitcoin, ""the South’s only Bitcoin ATM operator.""  Helsinki, Finland  Newcomer Cointter has launched two very utilitarian bitcoin machines in Helsinki, Finland.  Looking a little like a cross between a payphone and a hotel safe, the machines are northern Europe's first two-way bitcoin ATMs, buying and selling bitcoins for cash.  One is in Helsinki's Delish store and the other in the Kynsilaukka restaurant. Both were developed in cooperation with LocalBitcoins.com.  Cointter promises future models with a more refined design, which it plans to ship to other European locations including France and the UK.

The paper told newsBTC that around 11.3% of new orders over the past week were paid for in bitcoin.  The Chicago Sun-Times claims it usually receives a few dozen subscription orders per week. This week the paper got 62 orders: 23 were placed online using a credit card, 32 came from the paper’s call centre, while seven were paid for in bitcoin.  Surprised by demand  Keep in mind that these are figures for the first week of bitcoin sales. While 11% isn't much, it's not bad, either.  A representative of Chicago Sun-Times publisher Wrapports LLC, said he is “blown away” by the orders. It appears that the paper wasn’t expecting a double-digit share for bitcoin orders.  He added:  “The key metric will be measuring this over time – we got a really nice initial PR boost with this, now the question is how will this affect sales over the next 3, 6, 12 months?”  The representative also said the paper is looking at ways of repurposing and modifying marketing as bitcoin adoption grows and more consumers start to appreciate the advantages of bitcoin payments.  The paper launched a voluntary paywall trial in February and it was a success – receiving small donations from more than 700 readers.  Content for coins  The Chicago Sun-Times bitcoin paywall is significant as it might pave the way for similar solutions from other content providers. A number of small publications are accepting bitcoin donations and some are experimenting with paywalls. However, few big publishers seem to be interested.  The financial world is taking notice too, as digital microtransactions could redefine the way that paywalls operate. The Chicago Sun-Times is selling standard subscriptions for bitcoin. Hence, the paper is merely applying a new payments system to a traditional product, ie a standard subscription.  However, bitcoin has the potential to offer custom subscriptions or even an 'a la carte' approach to paywalls. In other words, readers could simply buy a single story rather than a full subscription.  This is not practical with traditional payments services, as the fees are too high – few people would be willing to “buy” a news piece or column for $0.50 and pay a $2-$3 fee on top of it.  PriceWaterhouseCoopers published a report  on the possible impact of digital currencies on the media industry in January and the takeaway was very positive indeed. PwC concluded that digital currencies could transform the way content is monetised, thus benefiting artists, authors and other content creators by enabling direct sales through economically viable microtransactions.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/11/chicago-sun-times-gets-11-of-new-subscriptions-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc84840ef9d21649e9e88e1e9589d13d683c37f0-1000x684.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Silbert has big plans for the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which is expected to open for public investors sometime in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the time being, the trust is a private investment vehicle but once it opens to the general public, the fund is expected to attract a new breed of bitcoin investors.  Silbert  believes the 100,000 mark is a big milestone for BIT, and it’s hard to argue otherwise. After all, this grand total amounts to almost $40m at press time.    Big milestone today for Bitcoin Investment Trust -- now holds over 100,000 bitcoin http://t.co/nBzlaGupy4 cc @BitcoinTrust      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) April 10, 2014    Slow progress  As it stands, Silbert’s BIT and the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust are vying for the same market, both must overcome a number of hurdles. However, BIT appears to have an advantage: it is not an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Hence, Silbert does not need approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, but the Winklevoss twins do.  Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss filed their bitcoin investment fund with the SEC back in July 2013. Last month the Winklevoss' chief legal counsel Kathleen H Moriarty told CoinDesk that the ETF should be approved by the end of the year.  White the BIT does not have to jump through SEC hoops, it does have to meet some unique requirements to remain exempt from the SEC approval process. Silbert explained the process and outlined his plans for BIT expansion in an interview with CoinDesk two weeks ago.  Reshaping the bitcoin investment landscape  Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust and the Pantera Bitcoin Partners fund could change the way people invest in bitcoin, but more importantly they could change the way investors feel about the currency.  These organisations are not designed with speculators in mind, however. Bitcoin investment funds are going after traditional investors who do not have a habit of entering unregulated markets and investing in speculative investment vehicles.  It is still too early to say whether these funds can broaden the investor base and make digital currencies more appealing in traditional circles. Regardless of how much traction they get, they are likely to improve public perception among many who are reluctant to enter the niche.

According to reports  , during Boao Forum, Xiaochuan offered his opinion on the nascent technology, saying that China would not seek to ban bitcoin and other digital currencies entirely.  Said Xiaochuan:  ""It is out of the question of banning bitcoin as it is not started by central bank.""  Xiaochuan continued his statements, offering a potential new potential classification for bitcoin, and suggesting that the PBOC may be actively considering how to treat bitcoin.  Xiaochuan said:  ""Bitcoin is more a kind of tradable and collectible asset, such as stamps rather than a payment currency.""

Likewise, the price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk CNY BPI was up 12.9% at press time to reach ¥2630.70, up from the day's open of ¥2,329.99.  Uncertainty lifts  News of the statement first surfaced at roughly 7:00 GMT, with the publication of a report by China Securities Network, a news outlet that provides real-time financial reporting, and later resurfaced on a number of similar news channels.  Though the remark may simply amount to an informal statement, it seemingly dispels fears percolating since March that China would potentially seek to ban bitcoin altogether.  Though, the PBOC is still likely looking to step up enforcement of past rules aimed at separating domestic banks from the alleged risk posed by the nascent digital currency industry.  In recent weeks, the price of bitcoin has dropped rapidly, from above $500 to below $400, on the news that China would seek to freeze the ability of major exchanges to conduct yuan deposits. Major exchanges have begun receiving notifications of account closures, and at present, Xiaochuan's statements do not suggest a change in this policy.  CoinDesk is continuing to monitor this developing story.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/11/chinas-central-bank-governor-pboc-wont-ban-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a68875164bd04ea31789425f3916819495af032a-658x408.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374516,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCcd,1397214967,We Deliver Local Brings Bitcoin to the High Street,"More than 40 independent and local shops in the UK are now accepting bitcoin. Some of them don’t even know about it.  As of April 1st, We Deliver Local, a UK-based e-commerce solution for local shops added bitcoin as an official payment method.  We Deliver Local allows registered customers to buy products online from their nearby greengrocers, butchers, fishmongers and delicatessens. The company also provides a delivery service for a flat fee of £2 where drivers pick up all the orders from shops and bring to the customers’ address.  Below is a short video produced by We Deliver Local on how their system works:  Supporting two communities at once  If a customer were to pay in bitcoin, We Deliver Local would take about a week to remit the shops in Pound Sterling.  “Some of the shops probably don’t even know they are accepting bitcoin,” said We Deliver Local’s director and developer, Lee Parkinson. “Many of them don’t even know what bitcoin is.”  However, according to Parkinson, the decision to accept bitcoin is good for both the local shops, and the bitcoin community. Bitcoiners looking to spend their digital currency now have another outlet, and the local stores just got themselves a new set of customers.  Parkinson said:  “The great thing with bitcoin is that the entire bitcoin community is so passionate. We put a press release out and it started trending on reddit. So that drove a lot of traffic to the site and people were keen just to use bitcoin and buy something in bitcoin. It’s almost like people are looking for an excuse to pay in bitcoin.”  In the last 11 days of bitcoin payment integration, We Deliver Local has received about four bitcoin payments.  A growing company  We Deliver Local was launched in April 2013 and it currently serves many of the major UK cities including: London, Manchester, Bristol and Sheffield. However, the entire network only has 40 stores as of now.  Parkinson said that the company is regularly adding more shops to its network across the UK.  “We are a new company, but we are growing quite quickly,” added Parkinson.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | SPONSORED,Roop Gill,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2014/04/11/we-deliver-local-brings-bitcoin-to-the-high-street,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4df651e72f59a512c1d1186c6b9448fff63c5d0a-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397549,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbBXdV,1397211697,Ripple Labs' Grand Plan to Build a Global Payment Protocol,"It's no coincidence that Ripple Labs was formed in 2012 to be a part of a payments revolution.  In 2013, the price of bitcoin hit a high that many had not thought possible, creating a sentiment that new and distributed technologies could change the global financial order on a fundamental level.  This enthusiasm is the driving force behind Ripple, and one of the reasons that it has already raised $6.5m in angel and seed funding from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.  The company says it has raised capital in its early stages because it aims to build the best global payment protocol, and it needs to hire talented people to do so.  ""You need a big team,"" explained Ripple CEO Chris Larsen. ""If this is really going to be a global protocol, it needs that [team].""  He added:  ""In the bitcoin world I’d say a lot of that value is going into mining. Whereas we’re focusing that stream of monetization towards building that team.""  Consensus  The concept of bitcoin mining is what has made that network itself so powerful.  At the time of writing, bitcoin's global network power is around the 48PH/s mark. However, all of that mining power requires electricity (and money) in order to complete blocks and transactions.  With the Ripple protocol, that type of consensus is conducted without any monetary incentive and instead relies on gateways to move money along with something called validators, which establish trust within the network.  The company's CTO Stefan Thomas says that unlike Ripple, bitcoin mining could potentially result in serious issues down the road:  ""The nice thing about not having an incentive is you avoid a whole string of economic problems where people are trying to game the system just to get to the incentive.""  People who have an interest in seeing Ripple succeed are better off with its protocol than a monetary incentive, at least from Ripple Labs' perspective.  Thomas makes a comparison with the concept of ISPs. They are 'stakeholders' in the internet, but do not directly own a piece of it. This, Ripple believes, is a prime example of how a truly global payment protocol should operate.  Its open-source nature also means that Ripple could change this in the future, although it doesn't plan to just yet, Thomas added:  ""If we need an incentive, we can add one. But its reasonable to start out without one and see how far you get.""  Removing barriers  Even with today's technology, it remains unrelentingly difficult to move money around the globe. Ripple plans to change this by building the best currency-agnostic payment protocol for financial companies to use.  According to the company, an international bank transfer today from the US to India might look something like this:  Ripple's use of distributed gateways and market makers could make this process much easier.  It would also benefit the community within a system that supports the Ripple protocol instead of banks just making fees from clearing, settlement and currency exchange:    What appears different at face value is that one company essentially replaces the role of several banks.      But the reality is that Ripple Labs' plan is only to develop its payment protocol, and allow an ecosystem around it to take the place of the traditional banking system to create shorter transaction paths. Thomas added:      ""What Ripple looks for is the shortest connection between your account and the other person’s.""            XRP  A payment system of any kind needs a unit of account. Existing digital payment systems, such as PayPal, use fiat money like the US dollar.  But here's where PayPal runs into a problem: with so many countries using different forms of government money, PayPal has to separate its businesses by each country that it does business in.  This makes for a relatively inefficient global platform. For example, with PayPal, one person cannot send Chinese Yuan to another who wants to receive bitcoin.  However, Ripple can do just that, and it uses its own method of account called XRP to help facilitate ""pathways"" to find a route of least resistance to move value around.  Because there is no mining, XRP, also known as a Ripple, has already been allocated within the protocol.  According to the company-owned Ripplecharts, there are approximately 100 billion XRP within the system. The idea is that as the protocol becomes popular, XRP will be needed as a unit of account for stakeholders to push value through the system.  XRP, in this way, is not designed to be an effective currency. ""It’s designed for a very specific purpose, it doesn’t have to be very fancy,"" said Thomas, the CTO.  He added:  ""It [XRP] doesn’t have to be very good [as a currency] in order to fulfil that anti-spam measure purpose for which it’s designed.""  Gateways and the protocol  XRP's use is to help build up Ripple as a protocol, but without Ripple gateways there wouldn't be any way to move money in and out of the system.  Gateways are similar to what exchanges do for the Bitcoin network in the way it allows people to trade currencies.  Right now, the most popular Ripple gateway is owned by Bitstamp, the exchange that has reportedly raised $10m from Pantera Capital, an all-bitcoin investment fund backed by Fortress Investments, Benchmark Partners and Ribbit Capital.  Gateways are the key to regulatory hurdles that many new financial technologies such as Ripple face. Thomas added:  ""The idea is that rather than us worrying about some global compliance strategy we provide the language, the graph for the different relationships. And then the gateway operators, they know their local jurisdiction.""  Identity and compliance  With compliance comes the question of identity verification. And that poses another potential problem Ripple is trying to tackle: leaving know your customer (KYC) to all of its gateways would prove rather problematic.  Anyone who has done business with more than one bitcoin exchange has dealt with verifying identity documents over and over again. This is an issue that Ripple is working to solve.  Greg Kidd, Ripple's chief risk officer and a former director at Promontory Financial Group, said:  ""There’s sort of the balance between security, knowing everything about everybody. And then there’s privacy, knowing nothing about anyone.""  The idea Ripple has is to use OpenID connect to be able to allow people to have a digital payments profile. This would give people ownership over their own financial history – and it could potentially be used globally, even for people in countries that don't use credit scores.  Said Kidd:  ""It means everybody in the world can have a payment identity. And they own it – that’s the cool thing, not the government, not the bank.""  Moving money  Since Ripple wants to be a payment platform, it is courting developers and bitcoin enthusiasts to get involved.  Some cryptocurrency investors have realized the potential to move cryptocoins and currencies from one place to another, said Thomas:  ""Our biggest constituency and the people who get the most value out of the system are bitcoiners trying to move money between different exchanges.""  Andrew White, who won a Ripple contest at a developer event for his 'One Million Gateways' concept, believes his idea is an example of the potential that exists for the protocol to be used to move money much easier than every before:  ""I believe One Million Gateways will be used for prototyping services by enterprises looking to get into the space.""  Services that could use the concept include remittances businesses, currency exchanges and payment processors.  Users don't necessarily need to know that Ripple is being used as the ""pipe"" but companies could use Ripple to facilitate these types of transactions.  Smart Contracts  Several efforts already exist to implement smart contracts that don't require a third party.  Ideas like Ethereum and colored coins exist because block chain technology allows for a system of enforcing contracts to protect the average person like never before.  The rise of legal technicalities like arbitration clauses have inadvertently taken away rights from consumers to fight contracts in court. However, smart contracts offer more logic and less legal minutiae.  Ripple is working on a smart contract enforcement system that will compliment its payment protocol.  Said Thomas:  ""You have to come up with interfaces, between the sandbox where these contracts are running and the rest of the network functionalities.""  If smart contracts are to be adopted, they have be trusted. This is something that Thomas has spent over two years thinking about, and the best system that he has found relies on x86 machine code that is very tight, meaning it has no flaws conceptually.  Thomas says that Ripple will use Google's Native Client, a solution that directly uses hardware-based machine code:  ""What Native Client does, the sandbox that it uses, it relies on this mathematical model which means that you can verify that it won’t break out of the sandbox.""  Native Client could be the best way to enforce a digital contract with low-level control, by using a very small codebase as a ""sandbox"" to protect from any abnormalities that could happen at a higher, web-based level.  Focus on protocol  There have been numerous detractors that have dismissed Ripple because it doesn't operate like most other cryptocurrencies.  But other than bitcoin, litecoin and perhaps dogecoin, most crytpocurrencies aren't payment mechanisms anyhow.  Ripple's focus on developing an open-source core payment protocol is different because there is no central figure directing the course of development. The company currently has eight core protocol developers, and is looking for more.  There is also a startup accelerator. CrossCoin Ventures, an independent entity but up two floors from the Ripple HQ, is looking for talent that can leverage the protocol.  LibraTax  , a company that does virtual currency tax returns, is the first tenet there. The impact of having a protocol prepared for mass adoption is something that developers should not dismiss, according to Larson, the Ripple CEO:  ""The protocol can just exist. That kind of macro opportunity should not be wasted.""  Relying on a community of developers, investors and financial companies is what Ripple is trying to foster. At the same time, focusing on the core technical aspects of its payment protocol is the company's real goal.  Ripple is hoping that the rest will be taken care of by those who seek an opportunity to change the current system of financial payments and contract enforcement.  ""That’s the beauty of it,"" said Asheesh Birla, the company's head of product. There are a lot of options to be involved with Ripple: Gateway, market maker or app developer leveraging the Ripple API, he said:  ""You can either do all of it, or you can separate it out and leverage the existing ecosystem.""

42397538,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbBXSg,1397189611,BitInvest’s Coincard is a Prepaid MasterCard for Bitcoin Lovers,"Leading Brazil-based digital currency exchange BitInvest has launched the Coincard, a bitcoin-friendly prepaid MasterCard.  The concept is simple. The card can be topped up with bitcoins, but you can use it pretty much like any other MasterCard.  Similar concepts have been employed by Cryptex and BitPlastic. BitPlastic has been around for a while, though it has attracted plenty of criticism over its pricing scheme, among other issues.  Cryptex, on the other hand, is new to the game: it announced its AML/KYC compliant Cryptex Card earlier this week, which can be used in 80 countries.  Coincard available globally  Since it uses MasterCard's vast network, BitInvest is planning to make Coincard available globally.  However it should be noted that when you send your bitcoins to the charging address, your balance will increase, but it will do so in Brazilian Reals (BRL). BitInvest points out that before the transaction you will know what exchange rate you are about to get and what sort of fees to expect.  The cards can be ordered, registered and funded using the Coincard website. BitInvest will ship the card just about anywhere, though there is still no exact shipping date and do details about its fees have been released.  The future for crypto cards  The concept of a bitcoin card that can be accepted worldwide seems promising indeed, but like most enticing ideas, it also has a number of potential problems.  Regulation might be an issue in some parts of the world, but fees and exchange rates are a bigger concern at this point.  BitInvest and Cryptex have not said much about fees, meaning it might be too early to evaluate either service, though the companies are expected to reveal more pricing info soon.  Whether or not we will get to see more crypto cards will likely depend on how these early entrants to the market perform in the long run. If Cryptex and Coincard gain traction in parts of the bitcoin community, we might see similar cards appear in different markets.  If on the other hand you fancy yourself as an early adopter, the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil sounds like a good place to burn some bitcoins and reals, as long as you don’t root for Messi’s Argentina, of course.
