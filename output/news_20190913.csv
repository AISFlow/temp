42382640,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sXAh,1568416392,Largest Bitcoin ATM Network Coinme Raises New Funding from Ripple's Xpring,"Coinme, which provides kiosks and ATMs for digital currencies, raised $1.5 million in a Series A-1 financing round that included Ripple’s subsidiary Xpring and Blockchain Finance Fund, the company said.  Proceeds from the funding  will be used for additional licensing to expand its U.S. and international coverage.  Co-founder and CEO Neil Bergquist told CoinDesk that Coinme is licensed to operate bitcoin ATMs in 29 states and will apply for further state licenses in the near future. As for international markets, Coinme has set its eyes on Europe, Central and South America given the high popularity of cryptocurrencies in these countries, Bergquist added.  Xpring is Ripple’s developer initiative  that focuses its investments in blockchain technology companies and is the firm’s first investment in the bitcoin kiosk industry.  Bergquist said Coinme raised $4.5 million in total in its previous financing, including $3.5 million in convertible debt, partly from Coinstar over the last few years, and $1.5 million from a venture fund in early 2017.  With more than 2,500 locations, Coinme currently services the largest bitcoin kiosk network in the world. Coinme began as a bitcoin exchange in 2014 and integrated its services with the coin-to-cash Coinstar machines in January.  The Coinstar kiosks allow customers to exchange bills and coins for a code sent to their mobile device that can be used to redeem up to $2,500 of crypto. The partnership was announced earlier this year with the kiosks mainly placed in public venues such as supermarkets.  Crypto kiosks and Bitcoin ATMs have quickly grown in popularity as coin use proliferates.  Data from Coin ATM Radar shows a nearly five-fold increase in the number of active crypto ATM installations since 2017. Earlier this summer, bitcoin ATM LibertyX surpassed 1,000 kiosks under service.  Outside of the kiosks, Coinme provides concierge trading, high-volume transactions for institutional investors, and cryptocurrency retirement options such as a self-directed IRA and 401(k). Bergquist said one of the services provides white-gloved transaction services to high-net-worth individuals with a minimum investment of $5,000.  The new funding will also go towards developing online wallets for retail investors to help them use cryptocurrencies for payments and remittance.

Tagomi’s COO Kevin Johnson told CoinDesk that its new platform addresses issues that stymie institutional crypto shorts.  Many large-scale investors could not short cryptocurrencies as rapidly as they might short an equity position because the existing borrowing process for crypto is too complex, Johnson said: “It's multiple steps, it’s a lot of work.”  “First, you have to either find an exchange that's able to lend, or talk to one of the centralized lending counterparties, negotiate rates, settle that, borrow, and then you could get to be in the process of actually selling the coin short.”  Johnson said this has been the biggest barrier for institutional investors.  Co-founder Marc Bharvaga said the service brings Tagomi closer to becoming a full-suite prime brokerage, which is how institutional investors prefer to manage their trading.  “Having a full prime brokerage functionality, which we now have through being able to do best execution, being able to custody, being able to lend, being able to short and there's quite a few other things on the road map as we think about the [crypto] space,” Bharvaga said.

42382632,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sX4P,1568383120,Facebook's Libra Pushes Back at Claims Project Is Threat to Financial Stability,"The head of the Facebook-led Libra Association has responded to claims that the cryptocurrency project threatens nations' financial stability.  In interview with French daily Les Echos on Thursday, Bertrand Perez, the association's managing director and COO, played down concerns over potential disruption to the monetary policies of central banks with currencies included in the Libra reserve – a basket of fiat currencies and government bonds that will back up the Libra digital currency.  Such claims ""do not seem to us to be justified,"" he said. ""It is their monetary policies that will influence the Libra through the basket and not the other way around.""  Perez justified the comments by offering details on the reserve, which he said will comprise of the U.S. dollar, the euro, yen, pounds sterling and the Singapore dollar (but not the Chinese yuan).  The reserve, he said, will be invested in the basket currencies and in ""very short-term"" government debt (of less than a year) of the countries of those currencies. At maximum, the reserve would amount to ""probably no more than $200 billion,"" Prerez said, though he provided a range from a ""few tens of billions"" and up.  While the reserve might seem huge, he argued that it's actually a ""low"" amount in the global financial markets. ""We are not going to become a new BlackRock,"" Perez added in reference to the U.S. investment management giant that has around $6.84 trillion in assets under management.  The Libra Association chief also spoke of what might happen if there was a crash in one of the currencies included in the basket.  ""If there is a catastrophe on a currency or a crisis between now and the Libra [launch], we could remove it from the basket, but this decision should be put to the vote and taken by a two-thirds majority of the members of the association., he said. While the association is still to decide on how to wight the basket, the U.S. dollar ""should be very significant, around half,"" according to Perez.  Currently with 28 member companies, including notable firms such as Visa, MasterCard, Paypal and Uber, Libra aims to have 100 on board next year.  These will be selected ""objectively,"" Perez said, ""based on rules and criteria defined according to their areas of activity"" such as NGOs, commercial entities and blockchain groups. Libra has also seen over 100 requests to join the association, with firms having to contribute ""at least $10 million.""  Of course, since the project was officially revealed, Libra has seen tremendous pushback from regulators. Most notably, perhaps, the French Economy and Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Thursday (presumably after this interview was conducted) that, due to the threat to monetary sovereignty, ""we cannot authorize the development of Libra on European soil.”  Perez in the article touched upon these issues, saying that Libra deliberately planned to launch its initial service a year after the white paper was published in June ""to solve all these problems.""  He further suggested that Libra was about to be authorized as a payment system in Switzerland, but that there is still plenty of work to do on the regulation front.  Even so, ""we are firmly maintaining our launch schedule, between the end of the first half of the year and the end of 2020,"" Perez said.

Under its new rules, anyone can deposit bitcoin, ethereum, or the gemini dollar and allegedly get up to a 6.2 percent annual return.  BlockFi told CoinDesk on Friday that while the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has risen substantially since BIA's launch in March, it dropped its minimum deposit requirement because of consumer demand. BlockFi previously mandated a 0.5 BTC, 25 ETH, or 2,500 GUSD minimum on deposits before the rule change.  Early withdrawal penalties have also been lifted on the BIA product and users can receive up to one free withdrawal per month.  “This update to our terms will make our products more widely accessible - which is a key theme of the crypto sector and part of our mission at BlockFi,” CEO and Founder Zac Prince said in a statement.  The company is eyeing an imminent Latin America market push which complements a launch in India earlier this year.  ""By making BIA open to all, we plan to target clients in Latin America, where banking services and credit reporting are limited. BlockFi's platform leverages blockchain rails to make wealth management products available on a much broader scale,” said Co-Founder and VP of Operations Flori Marquez in a statement.  ""US-grade financial products have typically only been available to high net worth individuals in countries like Argentina and Costa Rica,"" he added.  The product launch comes a month after the closing of an $18.3 million Series A round led by Valar Ventures.

42382639,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sXDD,1568372444,"Bitcoin Eyes Move to $10,950 Hurdle After Price Breakout","View  The 4-hour chart is reporting a bullish breakout. As a result, bitcoin could challenge key resistance at $10,956 in the next few days.  Daily chart indicators also indicate scope for a retest of recent highs.  A UTC close above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high) would activate twin bullish cues and open the door to $12,000.  A high-volume break below Wednesday's low of $9,855 would revive the bearish view, although, that looks unlikely.      Bitcoin has regained poise in the last 48 hours and could revisit recent highs in the next couple of days, charts suggest.  The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization picked up a bid at lows below $9,900 on Wednesday and rose past $10,100 yesterday, confirming a falling-wedge breakout on the 4-hour chart.  The falling wedge pattern, comprising of converging trendlines connecting lower highs and lower lows, was created during the pullback from last Friday's high near $10,956 (bearish lower high of Aug. 20) to Wednesday's low of $9,855.  The low-volume correction, however, ended with a bullish breakout on Thursday and the cryptocurrency is now looking north, and a re-test of the bearish lower high of $10,956 could be in the offing in the next couple of days.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,320 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $10,458 earlier today.  4-hour chart  The falling-wedge breakout is backed by an above-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI). The indicator has also breached the falling trendline.  Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is printing bars above the zero line, indicating bullish conditions. Meanwhile, the Chaikin money flow (CMF), which takes into account both prices and trading volumes, is also holding above zero – a sign of strengthening buying pressure.  As a result, further gains to levels above $10,900 look likely.  Daily chart  BTC created a long-tailed candle on Wednesday, indicating seller exhaustion below $10,000. Similar daily candles (marked with arrows) have consistently marked temporary bottoms and fueled minor price rallies over the last 10 weeks.  Hence, there is a strong case for a rise to the bearish lower high of $10,956.  BTC also appears to be forming the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern with the neckline resistance near $10,956.  So, a UTC close above that level would activate twin bullish cues: invalidation of bearish lower highs and an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.  The latter would create the room rise to $12,590 (target as per the measured move method).  On the downside, $9,855 (Wednesday's low) is the level to beat for sellers, although that looks unlikely at press time.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) authorized CF Benchmarks as an administrator on Friday, affirming that financial institutions can use the company's indices in any European financial products after the BMR takes full effect on Jan. 1, 2020.  Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks – which notably provides the indices used by CME Group for its bitcoin futures contract – told CoinDesk that this marks a first for cryptocurrency companies in the EU.  ""Here in Europe the use of indices and provision of indices is regulated, so for all regulated firms in Europe if they use a benchmark then they have to make sure that it comes from a regulated benchmark provider,"" he explained.  The regulatory scope for benchmarks in the EU for financial institutions is ""very broad,"" Chung said, noting that large banks and asset managers use indices for a number of purposes.  ""They're all captured, all in scope of regulatory requirements, and this will come into full force in January 2020,"" he said.  For example, any fund manager looking to issue an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks an index must track a regulated index.  Chung said:  ""There are a lot of regulated firms – there was a potential stumbling block for them if they did want to consider issuing products referencing cryptocurrency indices because they had to make sure if they wanted to market on Jan. 1 2020 [that they used a regulated index].""  While Chung said he could not name any specific companies at this stage, he has heard from firms interested in launching products which would track an index in the coming months.  Moreover, CF Benchmarks will maintain this license even if the U.K. exits the EU in the next few months, Chung said.

Armor’s Threat Resistance Unit (TRU) research team said in the report:  ""There are plenty of hackers willing to simply transfer stolen funds to the bank account or PayPal account of your choice or send you the funds via Western Union.""  The team said the new service had been spotted within the last year and it has bloomed into a ""key offering"" on the dark web.  Those using the service will get what appears to be a real bargain, gaining cash for bitcoin at roughly 10–12 cents on the dollar. For example, a customer can pay the seller $800 in bitcoin and $10,000 will be transferred to their account of choice.  Aside from being cheap, the service makes things much simpler for customers, since they no longer have to buy stolen online bank account credentials, set up a ""money mule"" account to receive the funds, and log into the stolen account to transfer the money.  Armor calls it a ""seamless turn-key money laundering service.""  There is a reason dark web sellers are offering such low prices, of course.  The service appeals to sellers because they are not taking possession of the funds themselves. Just transferring the cash puts the bulk of the risk on the buyer.  More generally, the report says that bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency, being used ""almost exclusively"" in dark web transactions. Cryptos with more privacy features, like monero, dash, and zcash are sometimes used, but tend to require more technical expertise on the part of victims, Armor said.

The investment hub allows qualified investors to participate in equity funding rounds for firms like Coinbase and Kraken, helping to attract traditional investors who are less than totally familiar with digital assets.  “The big challenge for the industry is investors want to invest in security tokens because they offer additional liquidity. But the liquidity is not there yet, as the asset class is very new,” Dixon said.  BnkToTheFuture has an existing network of 87,000 qualified investors. The new service will help issuers stay compliant with securities laws, Dixon said, and will make use of Diacle's experience with the tokenization process.

The event follows the first conference, in April 2019, which attracted 100 people. It was declared a success by the North Koreans, and a larger second conference was promised.  The 2020 event is being sponsored by the Spanish Korean Friendship Association and organized by the North's Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. According to the conference's official website, ""top ten market cap cryptocurrencies"" are assisting on the technical side, though it is not clear from the announcement what that means exactly.  As was the case in the first conference, restrictions appear to be liberalized. U.S. citizens are again welcome, and digital devices can be brought in for the conference. Internet access will be available.  The conference will run from Feb. 24-25 and be held at the Pyongyang Science and Technology Complex, a bizarre atom-shaped structure opened by Kim Jong-un in 2016. On the 26th, private business meetings may be arranged.  North Korea has been accused of stealing about $2 billion worth of crypto currencies and using them to support its weapons development. South Korean and Japanese exchanges have been identified as targets, with phishing being utilized to hack into user accounts.  More generally, the borderless nature of crypto has raised concerns that the North may use coins to get around international restrictions on trade and financial exchanges.  In addition to possibly helping the North achieve crypto advances, the conference may also have propaganda value, both telegraphing a sense of openness while also sending a warning to the West.  On a less obviously sinister level, conferences are a roundabout way for North Korea to boost tourism, and the 2020 crypto event includes an extensive travel itinerary, with everything from a tour of the Tower of Juche Idea to a two-day ski trip.

In an interview with Bloomberg  , the Singapore-based Shin said he had early talks to ensure a BCH futures contract would be available on an exchange regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). He also said Bitcoin.com hoped to partner with a retail brokerage.  No CFTC-regulated exchange offers bitcoin cash futures. Bitcoin cash is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, behind bitcoin, ethereum and XRP. Shin said the push into futures would increase trading volumes and liquidity, and ultimately boost BCH’s market cap.  Bitcoin cash was trading Thursday afternoon around $300 a coin with a market cap of nearly $5.4 billion dollars, according to CoinDesk data. This is half the market cap of XRP, the next-closest coin, and 1/35th the value of market leader bitcoin.  Crypto futures are new to US investors.
