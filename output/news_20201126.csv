42389370,4pHPaGKu7LL5ERBnY3JK1A,1606410198,Previously Unpublished Emails of Satoshi Nakamoto Present a New Puzzle,"Newly discovered emails between Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, and the late Hal Finney deepen the mystery around the cryptocurrency’s origins.  The three emails come from Bitcoin’s earliest days, when its future was uncertain. They show how closely Satoshi collaborated with early supporters at the time of Bitcoin’s launch.  While anything written or coded by Satoshi is intrinsically valuable to the community, perhaps the most intriguing parts of these messages are neither words nor code, but something seemingly prosaic: the timestamps, which present a new riddle.  Michael Kapilkov is an adjunct professor at Pace University in New York; since discovering Bitcoin, he has been interested in its origin story.  They were shared with me by journalist and author Nathaniel Popper, who during his work on “Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money” was provided access to Finney’s correspondence.  Finney, who died in 2014, was the recipient of the first Bitcoin transaction. A legend in his own right, he developed the first reusable proof-of-work system, among other achievements.  [Editor’s note: In preparing this article for publication, CoinDesk contacted Fran Finney, Hal’s widow, who confirmed she had provided his correspondence to Popper, who in turn confirmed sending the messages to the author. “In March of 2014 we sent Nathaniel Popper those files, documenting email exchanges between Hal and Satoshi,” Fran Finney told CoinDesk. “The files were retrieved from the computer Hal was using for personal email in 2009 and were provided with Hal's consent.”]  November 2008 was when Satoshi opened Bitcoin to public scrutiny. Until then, the project Satoshi had spent a year and a half coding was only shared privately with a select few. On Aug. 22 of that year, he emailed Wei Dai, the author of “b-money” and, sometime before that, Adam Back, the creator of Hashcash (whose proof-of-work function is used in Bitcoin).  The initial reception was less than ecstatic, Finney later recalled.  “When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best,” he wrote in 2013 in his penultimate post on the Bitcointalk forum. “Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee-jerk reaction.”  Sometime around Nov. 16, 2008, Satoshi shared a pre-release version of the Bitcoin code with several members of the Cryptography Mailing List, including James A. Donald, Ray Dillinger and Finney. The first of Satoshi’s emails I received from Popper was sent a few days later.  ‘How large do you envision it becoming? Tens of nodes? Thousands? Millions?’  In that first email from Nov. 19, Finney thanks Satoshi for some corrections and asks about the aspired-to size of the Bitcoin network as it would affect scalability and performance. Notably, Donald, the first person to respond to Bitcoin’s public announcement on the mailing list, had raised the same concern. “It does not seem to scale to the required size,” he wrote. This was a harbinger of the scaling debate that eventually led to the creation of splinter cryptocurrencies including bitcoin cash and so-called layer 2 solutions such as sidechains and the Lightning Network.  For Finney, this was not just a technical issue. Apparently in his mind, it has a bearing on Bitcoin’s future monetary value. A couple of months later, he stated that if Bitcoin became the world’s dominant payment system, then its value “should be equal to the total value of all the wealth in the world.” Extrapolating this logic further, he arrived at $10 million per bitcoin.  In a 2018 interview, Dillinger said the discussion that started on the public mailing list moved to private emails and eventually led to Finney and himself helping Satoshi with certain parts of the Bitcoin code:  “It was when we started talking about floating-point types in accounting code that I learned Hal was involved in the effort. Hal was reviewing the transaction scripting language, and both the code he had and the code I had interacted with the accounting code.”  Also, soon after the Nov. 19 email (sometime in the first half of December 2008), Satoshi added Finney to Bitcoin’s repository on Sourceforge, a site for managing open-source projects similar to GitHub.  ‘Thought you’d like to know’  Although the Bitcoin Genesis block is dated Jan. 3, 2009, Bitcoin’s public network did not go live until five days later when the source code was released to the public and the first few blocks were mined.  It is assumed that in the first few months of Bitcoin’s existence, most of the hash power was provided by Satoshi. However, Bitcoin’s creator was fully aware that if his peer-to-peer electronic cash were to succeed, he needed others to join.  The following two emails are from Satoshi to Finney. In the first one, from Jan. 8, 2009, Satoshi notified Finney about the release of version 0.1 of the Bitcoin software. It was sent just a few hours after Satoshi made an analogous public announcement on the Cryptography Mailing List.  It appears that Finney had replied to Satoshi, letting him know that he would try to look at the code over the weekend (Jan. 8 happened to fall on a Thursday).  The following day, Jan. 10, Satoshi also updated Wei Dai (whom he had emailed a few months earlier to inquire about the proper citation format for Dai’s “b-money”):  “I think it [Bitcoin] achieves nearly all the goals you set out to solve in your b-money paper.”  On the same day, a discussion between Satoshi and Finney ensued on Bitcoin’s own recently created mailing list on Sourceforge and through private emails that Finney later provided for publication to the Wall Street Journal. (In that exchange, uncharacteristically, Finney used his Gmail account instead of hal@finney.org; also worth noting, most of the email header data was stripped, the significance of which will become apparent later). In the middle of these technical discussions, on the eve of Jan. 11, the first-ever bitcoin transfer occurred, transferring 10 BTC from Satoshi to Finney.  Curious timestamps  In the January 2009 emails, Satoshi’s time zone appears to be eight hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). If you assume he actually was Japanese as his handle suggested, one might assume this reflects his ancestral land. However, Japan was nine hours ahead of GMT at the time. Even more intriguing is that somehow Finney’s email server had received both emails before Satoshi’s email server, which presents a conundrum.  Derek Atkins, a long-time colleague and friend of Finney, who was also a member of the Cryptography Mailing List, helped us compare these emails to Satoshi’s other emails to the list that Atkins happened to preserve in his archive. Atkins suggested the issue might be attributed to the way Satoshi’s computer was configured:  “Let's assume the sender's system is set in local time instead of GMT (which is/was common for Windows), but also assume there is a misconfiguration in the local timezone of the sending computer. That could explain the discrepancy.”  Then, we compared it to the first email Satoshi sent to the Cryptography Mailing List. While the headers of that email are generally consistent with our emails, its timestamps are also internally consistent. Atkins suggested the discrepancy could arise from the clock change:  “However, if the system is set up for local time and NOT set up for DST [Daylight Saving Time], then that would also explain the discrepancy. On Oct. 31, 2008, there was a 12-hour difference from EDT to ‘GMT+8,’ whereas in January there would be a 13-hour difference because the [U.S.] returned back to standard time.”  In the United States, the clock was moved one hour back on Nov. 2, 2008. Thus, the difference between the U.S. and Japan increased by one hour (Japan does not do clock changes). At first, this appeared to be a plausible explanation (assuming that Satoshi was not actually based in Japan), yet Satoshi’s emails to the Cryptography Mailing List from Nov. 8, 2008, and Jan. 8, 2009, do not have contradictory timestamps either.  It is possible Satoshi had initially set his computer’s clock to Japan time based on the pre-DST time difference and later forgot to make the adjustment. But it would not explain why his other post-DST emails do not exhibit the same abnormality.  Based on Satoshi’s email to Finney from Jan. 12, we know that at around this time he was at some place with limited connectivity, so perhaps his computer’s internal clock was out of sync:  “Unfortunately, I can't receive incoming connections from where I am, which has made things more difficult. Your node receiving incoming connections was the main thing keeping the network going the first day or two.”  It is possible that immediately after sending out an email with “normal” timestamps on Jan. 8, Satoshi had travelled to a location in a different time zone with limited connectivity from which he emailed Finney the following day.  Another possibility is that Satoshi Nakamoto (or the various team members behind the moniker) used several computers, some of which were configured accurately while some were not. But none of these theories feels quite satisfactory.  A more outlandish theory hinges on the popular hypothesis that Finney himself was Satoshi. If we assume he had connected Satoshi’s email to his main email account (hal@finney.org) for convenience, so he would not have to log in into his Vistomail account every time, then this might explain why the Finney.org server would receive it before the Anonymousspeech.com server.  This would also explain why Finney chose not to share these emails with the Wall Street Journal and why those he did share were missing most of the header data. But we must admit that just like the other theories mentioned above, we do not have any hard evidence to support it.  Satoshi remains ever-mysterious  These emails do not turn Bitcoin’s genesis story inside out, nor do they introduce any new, unlikely characters to the cast. They do not appear to resolve the eternal mystery surrounding Satoshi’s identity either.  At the same time, they present us with a new little puzzle. It has taken Sergio Demian Lerner seven long years to figure out the famous “Patoshi” pattern. Hopefully, it will take a bit less time for the community to suggest a better explanation for the odd timestamps.  The emails also provide additional insights about the close collaboration between Satoshi and early adopters like Finney during Bitcoin’s launch. Later on, understandably, Finney chose not to highlight his early involvement. “When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin,” he wrote in his final post to the Bitcointalk forum, without mentioning their communications before the release.  Yet, almost seven years later, we must agree with Finney’s other remark from the same farewell post:  “Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery.“  CORRECTION (Nov. 30, 20:40 UTC): An earlier version of this article mistakenly said the first BTC transfer was not referenced in any of the correspondence between Nakamoto and Finney. The latter mentioned it in one of the emails published by The Wall Street Journal: “I see you sent me a payment, thanks!”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Michael Kapilkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/26/previously-unpublished-emails-of-satoshi-nakamoto-present-a-new-puzzle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/206d9c7cee58984474ae9b8009d975408a641ea1-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This year, shoppers can spend or earn bitcoin on discounted deals from all over the world: the Bitcoin Black Friday event is back with over 300 merchants and nonprofits, more than 330 deals, and a chance to win 1 bitcoin (BTC), still currently worth around $17,000.      “It’s the way to draw attention from your average buyer around the world. … We're trying to attract the same people who are looking for deals to do the same thing with bitcoin,” John Riggins, head of international operations at BTC Media and organizer of Bitcoin Black Friday, told CoinDesk.      Read more: What Is Bitcoin?      A number of crypto firms are also offering special discounts on products and services available to users everywhere.      Riggins and some participating merchants told CoinDesk that tech upgrades have improved transactional use of cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. Combined with the recent bitcoin price run and the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies across the world, this could make Black Friday 2020 the one to beat.      “Some of these deals are available to people around the world only in bitcoin. If they're in Vietnam and want to make a purchase from Newegg Australia, or if they're in a country that faces extra scrutiny and can't use their credit card or bank account to buy things online, they can still use bitcoin and take advantage of these deals,” Riggins said.    Bitcoin Black Friday deals    The event will feature deals from hardware manufacturers including Trezor, Foundation Devices and Nodl.      Secure wallet provider Ledger is offering 40% discounts through Nov. 30 on Nano S and Nano X wallets, Benoit Pellevoizin, VP of marketing at Ledger, told CoinDesk.      Pellevoizin added the Nano S has a small storage capacity (two to three coins), ideal for backup, while the Nano X has a bigger stretch capacity and is Bluetooth-connected so you can use it on the go.      Shoppers can also browse through deals from online retailers for electronics (like Newegg) as well as food and home goods (shopping.io).      Part of this year’s Bitcoin Black Friday promotion includes Fold’s bitcoin-backed debit card, where users will get the chance to win 1 bitcoin if they sign up for and refer others to the card’s waitlist.    A special year    Bitcoin Black Friday was founded in 2012 as a grassroots initiative with a few dozen participating vendors by crypto enthusiast Jon Holmquist. In 2013, the event featured 600 businesses but momentum has slowed somewhat since. According to Riggins, although the event continued to a lesser degree, 2016 was the last year it was bitcoin-focused and had “effort put behind it” until now.      Technical advancements in Bitcoin since 2017, including scaling and Lightning Network solutions, combined with better payment processors with upgraded functionality, makes this a special year for Bitcoin Black Friday, Riggins said.

BitPay’s VP of marketing, Merrick Theobald, believes crypto payments have proven to be a safe and convenient way to shop online for both the business and consumer.      “This year, even more so than past years, we have seen an increase in people choosing to shop online, especially for the holidays,” Theobald told CoinDesk via an email.      Ian Balina, CEO of AI-driven cryptocurrency research platform Token Metrics, noted his company has had its best month so far on YouTube, with more people watching explainers and other content around crypto, thanks to bitcoin’s price going up.      “The interest level in bitcoin and crypto is high, much higher even for us than it was in August during the DeFi (decentralized finance) interest,” Balina said.      Token Metrics is celebrating its first anniversary this week with a special Black Friday deal, offering 40% off all of its subscriptions plans from Nov. 27 to Nov. 30.      Pellevoizin also agreed 2020 is far different from bitcoin’s previous price run in 2017.      “I think the current crisis and the fact that for six months you had a lot of newcomers entering the space makes this year’s Black Friday special,” Pellevoizin said.    Hodl or spend?    With bitcoin’s price recently approaching all-time highs, investors may be more inclined to buy and hold the asset for future gains. But BitPay’s Theobald doesn’t believe that will get in the way of big Thanksgiving spending this week.      “Historically, when the price of bitcoin goes up, consumers feel good and seek ways to spend these newfound gains. … Many hodlers have a target amount in mind and when crypto reaches a certain price point, they sell,” Theobald said.      Going a step further, Riggins suggested that devoted hodlers can always spend their bitcoin on discounted goods and services, then buy it back later.      Read more: 3 Reasons Bitcoin Crashed by $3,000 – And Why It’s Still Bullish      “We think it's the time to start promoting bitcoin’s payments use case again. Hodling bitcoin is still important, but to support a circular economy, we need both sides going,” Riggins said.      He added that some companies, such as Strike, will let users pay for purchases this Black Friday without actually selling any of their own bitcoin or incurring any capital gains taxes.      Users can pay with Strike’s bitcoin, which they can access through bitcoin and Lightning QR codes using the fiat in their bank accounts, Jack Mallers, founder of Strike, told CoinDesk via an email.      In 2019, Americans spent a whopping $7.4 billion online on Black Friday. By offering deals to shoppers from around the world, crypto could potentially turn the nation’s dedicated day for consumerism into a worldwide phenomenon.      “The best gift is a crypto gift because crypto is the future of money,” Balina said.

42405480,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMcn2,1606402419,"3 Reasons Bitcoin Crashed by $3,000 – And Why It’s Still Bullish","Bitcoin suffered a price crash earlier on Thursday, having missed record highs by a narrow margin earlier this week.      The top cryptocurrency by market value fell from over $19,300 to $16,327 during the early European trading hours and was last seen trading near $17,200, representing a 10% drop on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The sudden fall caught many traders off-guard, given the cryptocurrency was trading just 2% short of its record high of $19,783 on Wednesday.      So, what’s behind the $3,000 decline? Here are three of the primary factors responsible for the price drop:    1. Excess leverage    ""Bitcoin has fallen victim to a large unwinding of leverage trades in derivatives listed across major exchanges,"" Matthew Dibb, CEO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk.      Nearly $2 billion worth of derivative positions have been liquidated in the past 24 hours. Of that, more than $1.6 billion worth has been closed in the past 12 hours, according to data source Bybit.      The unwinding of leverage trades had been expected, as the cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures market, also known as the funding rate, had risen sharply to a multi-month high of 0.098% in the past few days – a sign of overleveraging, or overheating, in the market. The funding rate is decided and paid every eight hours.      Also read: Bitcoin Faces Volatility Rise as Futures Market Shows Signs of Overheating      With the price drop, the funding rate has fallen back to 0.011%, according to data source Glassnode. In effect, excess leverage has been crowded out.    2. Technical pullback    Bitcoin's rally from $10,000 to $19,400 seen over the past seven weeks looked overstretched on the technical charts.      The momentum was so strong that the cryptocurrency consistently traded above its 10-day moving average (MA) throughout the ascent, despite an overbought reading on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).      Assets seldom see a 90-degree rally, as speculators tend to book profits at regular intervals, pushing prices down to their short-term moving averages. The cryptocurrency has seen several pullbacks of 20% or more during the previous bull markets.      The price drop seen today has taken the cryptocurrency well below its 10-day average and allowed the RSI to realign in a more bull friendly-manner. ""It's a healthy pullback,"" Stack Funds' Dibb said.      According to chart analysts, price rallies with regular pullbacks are more sustainable than the near-90 degree ascents.      Some traders had positioned for the pullback by buying put options, or bearish bets, as noted by Deribit Insights.    3. Other factors amplified sell-off    According to trader and analyst Alex Kruger, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong's tweet thread about the U.S. Treasury Department’s rumored plans to track owners of self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets weakened the bullish move, allowing a price pullback.      ""This [regulatory concerns], against a backdrop of euphoria and unsustainable high leverage among longs led to the largest 24-hour drop since March,"" Kruger told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      ""However, if what Armstrong talked about comes to be, it would be extremely bearish. As of now, I see that as highly unlikely (in the short-term),"" Kruger said.      The downward move may also have been amplified by prominent cryptocurrency exchange OKEX's announcement it would resume withdrawals.      ""Most of the frozen bitcoin [on OKEx] had traded up around 70%, so there were a lot of unrealized profits locked up there,"" Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, said in a statement provided to CoinDesk. ""Once these coins were free to move, it's likely many traders sold them for dollars and stablecoins to realize those gains, adding greater momentum to the selling.""      Bitcoin had already fallen to around $17,600 when the exchange lifted the suspension at 08:00 UTC today, and fell to $16,350 in the following hour. OKEx suspended withdrawals on Oct. 16 when bitcoin traded near $11,500.      Also read: OKEx Sees Biggest Bitcoin Outflow in 6 Months Soon After Resuming Withdrawals    Still bullish    The path of least resistance for bitcoin remains on the higher side. ""The latest price drop is a noise against the larger bullish trend,"" Kruger said.      Indeed, bullish macro factors such as increased institutional participation, record money printing by central banks, and the search for yield remain intact despite the price drop.      Holding sentiment remains strong on Thursday, with the number of coins held on cryptocurrency exchanges at 2,384,913, the lowest level since Aug. 2018, according to data source Glassnode.      The data suggests investors view the current drop as a bull market pullback and remain confident about the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects. The metric has declined by over 17% this year, meaning there's been a liquidity drop in the market.      Lastly, today's price plunge has cleared out the excessive leverage, as noted above. With the cost of holding long positions normalized, bitcoin can now chart a more sustained rally to record highs.      Crypto Broker's Heusser expects the cryptocurrency to consolidate in the range of $17,500 to $19,000 in the short-term before resuming its uptrend.      Also read: Bitcoin Price Drops Almost $3,000 With Sharpest Sell-Off in 12 Weeks      ""Bitcoin is yet to peak,"" said Siddharth Menon, co-founder and COO of Mumbai-based WazirX exchange.

All of those complaints were thoroughly investigated, one through an internal investigation and two by separate third-party investigators, all of whom found no evidence of wrongdoing and concluded the claims were unsubstantiated.""

On Thursday, the company announced an ""end-to-end tokenization solution,"" comprising of both a primary market issuance platform called Desygnate, and SygnEx, a secondary market trading venue.      The solution will provide issuers a way to raise capital, grow liquidity, transfer ownership and manage corporate actions, Sygnum said. It will also bring investors access to tokenized assets, with targeted markets being venture capital, ""mid-cap"" companies, real estate, and art and collectibles.      With distributed-ledger technology underlying the solution, Sygnum claims instant settlement around the clock and seven days a week, as well as reduced counterparty risks with the platform powered by its own Swiss franc-linked stablecoin, Digital CHF (DCHF).      ""With Desygnate and SygnEx, we bring a blockchain-powered business solution to market which opens up a world of new opportunities for capital market participants to do business,” said Mathias Imbach, CEO-designate of Sygnum Group, in the announcement.      A number of companies are already using, or will soon start to use, the tokenization solution, according to Sygnum. It lists asset manager Azimut Group, property investment firm ImmoZins, real-estate token provider CrowdliToken, electric vehicle company BAK Motors and wine investment firm Fine Wine Capital AG.      Also read: Gazprombank Switzerland Executes First Bitcoin Trades, Announces Payments Initiative      As an alternative to traditional capital markets, Sygnum said it can help companies raise funding while avoiding high costs and extensive listing requirements.

Cryptocurrency exchange OKEx recorded a major bitcoin outflow just minutes after it lifted a five-week-long withdrawal suspension at 08:00 UTC Thursday.      About 2,822 BTC was moved from OKEx in block number 658,728 mined at 08:12 UTC. That's the biggest single-block outflow since May 2019, according to blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.      Of the 2,822 coins withdrawn, 456 were transferred to cryptocurrency exchange Binance and more than 400 were moved to other exchanges. Meanwhile, 54 accounts or addresses took direct custody of some coins.      OKEx halted withdrawals indefinitely on Oct. 16 after one of the exchange’s key holders went ""out of touch” with the exchange because they were held by authorities to ""assist an investigation.""      Some analysts have associated bitcoin's recent meteoric rise to 35-month highs above $19,000 with a supply shortage due in part to OKEx's suspension of crypto withdrawals. That's because the price rally began after OKEx's decision, dated Oct. 16.      Also read: OKEx’s Withdrawal Suspension Isn’t Behind Bitcoin’s Rally: Analysts      However, many market observers do not see a strong reason to link the latest price rally with OKEx’s issues.

At around 2:15 UTC, bitcoin (BTC) began to tumble significantly as its value dropped below a previous area of support at around $18,474.      Spot volume across major exchanges also rose sharply as bitcoin's 24-hour range fell to between $19,474 and $16,514 – its sharpest decline since the wider markets crash in March, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Today's fall marks an over 12% drop over 24 hours.      Bitcoin was last seen trading up slightly at $17,040.      ""I think this is a correction before we break $20,000,"" said Ki Young Ju, CEO at analytics firm CryptoQuant. ""Other long-term on-chain indicators like BTC and stablecoin reserve say the potential buying pressure still prevails so far.""      While the reason for the drop isn't entirely clear, the sell-off move comes at a time when Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong voiced his concerns on Wednesday night over the U.S. Treasury Department’s rumored plans to attempt to track owners of self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets.      It also came soon before an expected flood of bitcoin onto the market that had been frozen on the OKEx exchange due to an absent key holder. OKEx restarted withdrawals at 08:00 UTC, well after the main portion of Thursday's drop.      The plunge liquidated $950 million worth of positions across major exchanges, as noted by derivatives data provider Bybt. Nearly $90 million worth of positions on Compound Finance was also liquidated as the price of dai on Coinbase, which the platform's price oracle uses to execute liquidations, spiked 30 percent.      ""The latest BTC price drop is the first of many tests for new money on whether they have the vision and stomach to truly invest in BTC and the future of digital finance, or if they'll simply repeat 2018 and wash out of the market,"" said Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic.

42433235,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO44Nh,1606356934,Coinbase CEO: Trump Administration May 'Rush Out' Burdensome Crypto Wallet Rules,"Brian Armstrong is worried the Trump Administration is about to send the cryptocurrency industry a parting gift.      The Coinbase CEO took to Twitter Wednesday night to blast the U.S. Treasury Department’s rumored plans to attempt to track owners of self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets with an onerous set of data-collection requirements.      If the whispers are to be believed, outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is preparing to tamp down on one of the fundamental tenets of the cryptocurrency ethos: the ability of the individual to hold his or her own crypto unmolested.      “This proposed regulation would, we think, require financial institutions like Coinbase to verify the recipient/owner of the self-hosted wallet, collecting identifying information on that party, before a withdrawal could be sent to that self-hosted wallet,” Armstrong tweeted.      If true, the regulation would represent a broadside against the U.S. cryptocurrency industry like few ever levied by the federal government. It would force corporations to know every counterparty to their users’ crypto transactions, keeping logs, tracking movements, and verifying identities even before a transfer could take place.      It would also bring to pass the worst-case scenario envisioned by industry players when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body, told its member countries to apply the so-called Travel Rule to crypto businesses last year. This long-standing rule requires financial institutions to collect information about the sender and receiver of a money transfer. But it was ambiguous what that would mean when someone sends bitcoin from, say, a Coinbase account to an address controlled by a private key on a sheet of paper kept in a sock drawer.      Read more: Crypto ‘Gray’ Markets Could Be Unintended Consequence of FATF Travel Rule      The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    Widespread impact    And it would not just affect those who store their coins on a hardware device like Trezor or Ledger. Many crypto services use non-custodial wallets. Decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts. Software wallets, paper storage. All would need to prove their provenance to transact with regulated entities under the rumored rule.      Such a sweeping interpretation of FATF guidance has already been applied in Switzerland and the Netherlands. There, virtual asset service providers (VASPs) must prove the ownership of non-custodial crypto wallets ahead of transfer.      Armstrong said Wednesday that such a regulation “would be a terrible legacy and have long-standing negative impacts for the U.S.”      “This additional friction would kill many of the emerging use cases for crypto. Crypto is not just money – it is digitizing every type of asset,” he said.      To date, regulation of decentralized cryptocurrency networks had been mostly limited to the on/off ramps between the networks and the traditional finance system, according to Jacob Farber, partner at blockchain law and consulting firm Ouroboros LLP.      This state of affairs left the industry ""mostly unregulated"" and private, such that it has been able to offer a real alternative to traditional finance, Farber said.      ""Imposing a KYC [know-your-customer] requirement on transactions between on/off ramps and every wallet that transacts with them expands the reach of regulation over crypto exponentially,"" Farber added. ""More importantly, it changes what crypto can be, at least at scale.""      He called Armstrong's concerns justified and said these potential regulations should be taken seriously by the cryptocurrency community.    Preemptive strikes?    Armstrong’s tweets appeared to break long-simmering industry fears over this kind of regulation into full public view.      In recent days, multiple cryptocurrency lobbyists and advocacy groups have staged what in hindsight appears to have been a soft influence campaign to shape public opinion of non-custodial wallets.
