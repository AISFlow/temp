42426554,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZHh,1444422628,Commonwealth Central Bankers Raise Bitcoin Policy Questions,"Commonwealth central bank governors say they want to look more closely into the impact of digital currencies on monetary policy before adopting a stance toward the technology.  The comments came earlier this week during a meeting of about 30 central bank governors from the Commonwealth – an intergovernmental organization composed of 53 member-states. Held on 6th October and chaired by Bangladesh Central Bank governor Aitur Rahman, the event centered on bitcoin in the context of global remittances.  Government ministers and other officials were also in attendance.  The topic of digital currencies and cross-border payments served as part of a broader conversation about the negative impact of regulation on remittances, particularly the closure of accounts for money-related businesses that banks deem too risky to work with.  Many startups working in the digital currency industry today, even in countries with more advanced understandings of the technology like Australia and the US, continue to struggle to gain access to even basic banking services.  The meeting  was intended to look at ""the potential of virtual currencies to decrease costs and improve the efficiency of transfers"" and included a presentation by London School of Economics historian and CoinDesk contributor Garrick Hileman on the state of digital currencies.  While the potential for digital currencies to address remittance pain points was acknowledged by those in attendance, some governors at the meeting raised questions ""about the implications for monetary policy and financial stability"", according to the Commonwealth Secretariat.  Jwala Rambarran, central bank governor for Trinidad and Tobago was quoted by the Commonwealth Secretariat as saying:  ""The Commonwealth Secretariat has a key role to play in sharing knowledge and developing research on the potential and implications of this new technology. If we decide to regulate virtual currencies, we are unaware of the financial instability risks posed by this currency. This is an area we need to determine carefully.""  During the meeting, representatives also discussed best practices for describing the technology.  Hileman characterized the meeting as a positive one, telling CoinDesk:  ""There was significant interest shown by many Commonwealth member countries in the potential of cryptocurrencies to have a positive impact on reducing costs and other inefficiencies in traditional remittance services.""

42426561,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZJh,1444416366,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Gemini’s Stellar Debut,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of bitcoin media coverage and its impact.    It's been a busy week in bitcoinland, with the launch of Gemini – the Winklevoss brothers' long-awaited bitcoin exchange – leading the digital currency's narrative in the mainstream press.  More positive news came from Santander InnoVentures – the Spanish megabank's VC firm – in the form of its contribution to Ripple's Series A funding round. The estimated $4m investment is the latest sign that major banks are still optimistic about the blockchain and media outlets are just as in love with the story.    Elsewhere, bitcoin saw its share of naysayers receive air time, with one reporter questioning whether the environmental impact of running the bitcoin network was worth the cost.    Gemini arrives  As put by the Financial Times' Philip Stafford, the ""twins best known for their dispute with Mark Zuckerberg over the creation of Facebook"" launched a bitcoin exchange this week.  Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss secured approval on Monday from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the state's banking regulator, for an application for a limited liability trust company, launching Gemini to the public on Thursday.  Stafford wrote  :  ""The exchange will act as a gateway for users who want to trade bitcoins but also have it linked with a normal bank account. However the launch comes as some startups struggle to turn their ideas into long-term sustainability.""  Having noted how US financial service regulators had recently cracked down on unlawful virtual currency trades, Stafford then went on to comment on many banks' willingness to explore the use of the blockchain, ""the security, trade affirmation and settlement technology behind bitcoin"", noting the VC interest in the technology.  Nathaniel Popper, a reporter at the The New York Times, also covered the news, noting the long build-up to the exchange's launch as a result of various regulatory hurdles.  He wrote:  ""Wall Street banks have recently been expressing growing interest in harnessing the technology underlying bitcoin. But it is still unclear whether they and other large financial players will want to trade bitcoin itself, as the Winklevoss twins are betting. Much of the interest from Wall Street is in the technology that allows direct digital transactions.""  'Bitcoin island'  Moving on to highlighting bitcoin's largely stagnant price over the last year, Popper touched on the Winklevoss' involvement in bitcoin.  ""The first company they backed, BitInstant, did not survive. They quickly began working on a bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund, which is expected to trade on the Nasdaq exchange. That fund is still waiting regulatory approval,"" he said.  However, the twins, Popper added, have publicly stated their willingness to work with regulators rather than challenge them.  Cited in the piece, Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini's chief executive, described the potential impact of his company in the space in a rather poetic way:  ""Bitcoin is an island right now, and Gemini is building a bridge to the financial mainland ... Gemini is simple and easy-to-use for a first-time bitcoin buyer while at the same time powerful enough and feature-complete for a professional trader.""  Bitcoin respect  Fortune's Daniel Roberts, titled his piece ""With Gemini, Winklevoss brothers seek respect in bitcoin"", a nod to their lingering affiliation in the public mind with Facebook.  Roberts began by saying that the brothers had taken the approach of asking for permission as opposed to asking for forgiveness.  ""That's why they waited for months to obtain licensing from the New York [State] Department of Financial Services before launching Gemini,"" he added.  Regulation, Roberts said, has been the ""hot-button issue in digital currency recently"" whilst highlighting that a series of startups had decided to stop serving New York-based customers instead of applying for the state's BitLicense.  ""But a BitLicense isn't what the Winklevosses wanted. Rather, they sought authorisation to operate Gemini as a chartered LLC trust company. To service institutional banking clients, the BitLicense, they say, isn't sufficient – hence their play for a trust charter,"" explained Roberts.  Houman B Shabab, a professor at New York Law School, has previously written for CoinDesk about the advantages of being granted a banking charter as opposed to a BitLicense.  A funding boost  Just when you thought that you'd heard the last of another bank joining in the blockchain and distributed ledger fun, Santander InnoVentures – the VC arm of Spanish megabank Santander – comes along and contributes an estimated $4m to Ripple's Series A round.  Business Insider's Oscar Williams-Grut covered the megabank's support, writing:  ""Santander has made its first investment foray into the hot field of blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin. Santander InnoVentures, the bank's $100m tech investment fund, has invested an estimated $4m in Ripple, a Silicon Valley company adapting the blockchain for mainstream finance.""  Despite it not being a huge investment, Williams-Grut noted that it did represent a strategic stake for Santander that will allow the bank to keep up with developments in the blockchain space, adding:  ""Blockchain, or distributed ledger, technology is one of the most hotly anticipated technology developments in finance in a generation.""  Auction announced  Silk Road and bitcoin were together again in the news this week.  The US Marshal's announcement that it will seek to auction off $10.6m of Ross Ulbricht's confiscated bitcoins captured the attention of a slew of journalists, resulting in wide press coverage.  The Daily Mail ran with ""US Marshals to action dark web drug dealer's $11 million bitcoin fortune: Bidders get the chance to buy Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht's fortune ... at a discount"".  In the piece  , Darren Boyle, said:    ""The 32-year-old criminal created the Silk Road website on the dark web which facilitated more than $200 million of anonymous online drug dealing all paid with the digital currency bitcoin.""              Boyle continued: ""Ulbricht claims that he did not acquire the bitcoins by illegal means and insists that he is the legal owner. Since they were seized, the bitcoins have lost almost three-quarters of their value.""      Just another example of how the digital currency continues to be linked to the criminal underworld.    Bitcoin delusion    In less positive news, John Quigg wrote an opinion piece titled ""Bitcoins are a waste of energy - literally"" for, The Drum, a commentary website with a sister TV show on Australia's ABC TV.      Quigg's piece was one of the more roundly criticized of the week. It began:      ""Vast amounts of electricity go into feeding the bitcoin delusion. Fortunately, it's unlikely that the digital currency will survive long enough to generate the environmental disaster that would arise if it became a major part of the financial system.""              Only a handful of insiders, Quigg said, have noticed a threat inherent in bitcoin's very design: that of ever-increasing environmental damage from electricity used in the 'mining' of bitcoins.      ""In essence, the creation of a new bitcoin requires the performance of a complex calculation that has no value except to show that it has been done,"" he wrote. ""The crucial feature, as is common in cryptography, is that the calculation in question is very difficult to perform, but, once done, is easy to verify.""    Fortunately, he added, it is unlikely that bitcoin will survive long enough to generate the environmental disaster that would arise if it became a major part of the financial system. ""The same design feature that requires the use of so much electricity is the fatal flaw in bitcoin as a currency,"" he noted.  Whether bitcoin survives in the long-term remains to be seen, but the truth is that most other commodities out there, and even networks like the Internet, have an inherent carbon footprint.  The question is whether bitcoin will come to be seen as a public good that's worth the cost.

42426569,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZdh,1444388948,"Remittance Firm Toast Pivots from Bitcoin, Raises $850,000","Singapore-based remittance startup Toast, previously known as Cryptosigma, has pivoted away from bitcoin and blockchain technology and reportedly raised $850,000 (S$1.2m) in seed funding.  The startup – which seeks to facilitate remittances for Filipino workers living in Singapore – announced its re-branding in a blog post in July and said it would for now operate as a ""bitcoin invisible"" solution.  The post read:  ""We realised as wonderful as bitcoin is, it is still not mass market suitable and we wanted to help make it so by deploying a product that a) solved a big problem right now (not 10 years from now) and b) a product that appealed to a large enough group of people with problem 'a'.""  A Startupbootcamp alumnus, Toast will now allow consumers to load its smartphone app – due to be released to Google's Play store – with a local offline travel card or bank account and send money to their relatives in the Philippines, thus bypassing traditional remittance agents.  In so doing, Toast will tap into the Philippines remittance market, which according to a 2010 World Bank study is the second largest recipient for remittances in Asia, accounting for 10% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2014.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/09/remittance-firm-toast-pivots-from-bitcoin-raises-850000,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f61953eb807436919b4b052f6dbd6d7dd7cc7037-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398719,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRBY,1444382495,Could Card Networks Take Bitcoin Mainstream?,"Ed Boyle is CEO at Blade, a payment processing platform that brings digital currencies onto traditional payment rails. In this article, co-authored by co-founder Daniel Delshad, he argues that, in order to cross the chasm into mass adoption, bitcoin needs to connect with existing debit card networks.  The amount of active bitcoin wallets and the number of daily transactions have increased significantly over the past year, but, still, most people have never used bitcoin (nor have plans to, as per a recent Goldman Sachs survey).  While the bitcoin adoption curve is arguably better than that for the Internet, it is slower than that for cell phones. The Internet was under the radar for years and didn’t really take off until a network started to develop and the network effect kicked in.  Cell phone adoption was quicker and steeper, largely because a new network of users wasn’t needed. Cell phones, from the beginning, were interoperable with legacy telecom rails (ie landlines).  To date, the bitcoin industry has been focused on creating a new, distributed network for applications like mining, storage, exchange and commerce.  Arguably, it has fallen short in its efforts to enable bitcoin to be spent like sovereign money. Not one of the top 100 global merchants accepts bitcoin. In fact, according to CoinDesk’s most recent State of Bitcoin report, 100,000 merchants accept payment in bitcoin, which is just 0.3% of the number that accept payment by credit card.  The rate of merchant acquisition is not increasing rapidly, despite the extremely small baseline costs associated and the number of funded merchant processors, such as Coinbase and BitPay, pursuing them.  Without the ability to spend bitcoins at most merchants, it will never reach mass adoption as a currency. American Express, Discover Card and PayPal each still battle the perception of their lack of merchant acceptance, despite being accepted at 100 to 250 times the number of merchants as bitcoin.  The reality is, 99.9% of the world’s population does not own bitcoin and why should they? You simply can’t spend it everywhere you can spend money today.  Crossing the chasm  To cross the chasm from early adopters to mass adoption, merchant acceptance has to be the norm, not the exception.  When bitcoin can be used to buy groceries and pay bills where people live and work, it will start to have utility for the masses. Until then, it will remain a niche application.  It’s time to consider inter-operability and connect bitcoin to existing debit card networks. By linking bitcoin to these networks, consumers get immediate access to over 28 million merchants around the world.  [post-quote]  Users don’t need a new app or behavior at point-of-sale and there is no need for merchants to be sold into a new program. Give users the ability to spend their bitcoin whenever and wherever they want and watch the adoption curve greatly steepen.  But, issuing debit cards is not easy. Virtually all banks outsource their card programs to specialists. Further, there are ever-changing regulations that vary from state to state and country to country.  For bitcoin companies, which are generally multinational by nature, it’s quite risky to deploy a card program. Many attempts have been shut down for lack of compliance and some well-funded companies have made high-profile mistakes getting a card program to market.  The same way you might not expect to see bankers setting up wallets and mining operations, we should not expect bitcoin companies to build card programs in-house.  It makes more sense to leverage outsourcing professionals with experience in the space who can expertly manage chargebacks, refunds, fraud, KYC, AML, velocity limits and risk management.  Bitcoin debit cards are still uncommon and many programs have been unsanctioned and short-lived, often cobbled together by companies with little or no experience in this (regulated and conservative) space.  Cards can become a key enabler for bitcoin companies, especially if they become long-standing offerings.  Great potential  Bitcoin and the blockchain both have the potential to be the greatest financial and technological breakthroughs ever.  As history shows with the Internet, it takes years for major technology shifts to reach mass adoption and for the benefits to affect our daily lives.  While mass adoption of bitcoin and the blockchain may still be years away, enabling near-ubiquitous payments acceptance will greatly improve the utility of bitcoin and, therefore, increase its underlying value and accelerate its proliferation.  While numerous companies are working on developing end-to-end solutions for the blockchain and bitcoin, debit cards will have an immediate impact on accelerating adoption to mass adoption.
