The native token of the Terra ecosystem was recently down over 53% over the past 24 hours after the organization's UST stablecoin continued to fall well short of its dollar peg, and amid a report that the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), the non-profit established to support the Terra network, was aiming to raise $1 billion to restore this parity. The decline followed a 30% drop on Monday. UST was recently in the red over 6%.  Meanwhile, bitcoin's roughly 1.4% upturn represented an improvement over the previous day when the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dove below $30,000 in early Tuesday trading – the first time since July 20 it had fallen below this threshold. Bitcoin was recently trading just above $31,000.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, outperformed over the same period, rising approximately 3.5%, and was changing hands around $2,350. Other cryptos were mixed for much of the day with AXS recently off over 6%, but CRO and meme coin SHIB in the green more than 8% and 10%, respectively.  The crypto industry continued to feel the shockwaves of wider geopolitical and economic turmoil. Crypto exchange giant Coinbase (COIN) missed its first-quarter revenue estimates amid a 44% decline in trading revenue from the fourth quarter. Miner Riot Blockchain (RIOT) also missed analysts predictions for its first three months of 2022.  Cryptos' less tumultuous Tuesday tracked equity indexes, which were mixed with the tech-heavy Nasdaq rising about a percentage point and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling slightly. Investors will be eyeing the April consumer price index report, which is widely expected to show that inflation slowed but prices remained high.  In emailed comments, Jaime Baeza, CEO of Miami-based crypto hedge fund ANB Investments, noted the pressure of macroeconomic events, including inflation and a tightening of central bank monetary policy on stocks and digital assets but attributed the most recent drop-off in bitcoin ""to the de-peg of the UST."" Baeza wrote that LFG's decision to defend the peg by selling bitcoin reserves ""accelerated the sell-off of the broader crypto market as panic spread, and a more black swan systemic-risk event loomed closer.""  In an interview on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Joseph Kelly, CEO of bitcoin financial services firm Unchained Capital, called the depegging ""a scary headline thing.""  But he added optimistically: ""It's one of those things that you get to hold in contrast to bitcoin as a more sound, more explainable asset that isn't overpromising and trying to do things like maintain a dollar peg. It's one way that Bitcoin continues to shine in the long run.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,001 +0.2%  DJIA: 32,160 -0.2%  Nasdaq: 11,737 +0.9%  Gold: $1,839 -0.8%  Insights  Predicting crypto markets is challenging  The last week in crypto has shown an immense volatility, that few if any assets can match. Markets have lost more than $1 billion as Terra’s UST stablecoin was thrown off its 1:1 dollar peg and the crypto majors collapsed, bringing with it plenty of liquidations.  There’s a lot to unpack about the collapse of Terra’s UST. Probably the least understood part of it was the Luna Foundation Guard’s decision to lend out almost the entirety of their reserves to market makers to support the $1 UST peg by specifically making trades marked to $1. Somewhere there’s theoretical merit to this, but the market saw LFG’s reserves at critically low levels and pushed to liquidate as much as it could.  The timing of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s report on stablecoins couldn’t have been better.  “These vulnerabilities may be exacerbated by a lack of transparency regarding the riskiness and liquidity of assets backing stablecoins,” the report read, with Nellie Liang, the Treasury Department’s undersecretary for Domestic Finance, adding at an event, “They have the potential to generate destabilizing runs if the value of the assets backing the stablecoin decline abruptly.”  In many ways, stablecoins were one of the post-March 2020 legacies. They were supposed to create real utility and acceptance for the asset class and reflected growing institutional interest. After all, before March 2020, stablecoins had a market cap of just over $5 billion. Now that number is closer to $175 billion.  Some might think that this triple whammy of the de-pegging of UST (and its likely failure), a violent decline in crypto prices and a condemnation of stablecoins by the Fed would put the asset class in a precarious position. It would be a test of faith and conviction.  Sure, some data suggests that very thing. Bitcoin is flowing into exchanges at a pace not seen since November 2017.  Just over 50,000 bitcoin went into exchanges on Monday. Traditionally, exchange inflow means that traders are getting ready to sell their assets, which is seen as a bearish signal for prices. But it also means that traders might be preparing to make a play for the derivatives market. In this scenario, they would open long positions to accelerate their gains as the price of crypto recovers.  Consider what happened during November 2017. As Glassnode data shows, there was plenty of bitcoin on exchanges. It was the peak of the initial coin offering bubble and the price of bitcoin continued to appreciate – despite all these bitcoin on exchanges. Yes, there was a derivatives market, as BitMEX launched in 2014, but at the time it was still relatively unsophisticated and wouldn’t come of age until 2018.  The point is, this asset class, in the grand scheme of things, is still in its infancy. There are many signals we can use to help navigate through the market, but at the end of the day, crypto’s unpredictability means these indicators signify predictions and are not definitive.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holding Support at $30K, Resistance at $35K  Bitcoin (BTC) stabilized at around the $30,000 support level, which could keep short-term buyers active. Still, upside appears to be limited, initially toward the next resistance level at $35,000.  BTC rose by as much as 4% over the past 24 hours. It's down by 16% over the past week. Several alternative cryptos (altcoins) are outperforming BTC over the past 24 hours, suggesting a greater appetite for risk among short-term traders.  Typically, BTC declines less than altcoins during market recoveries because of its lower risk profile relative to smaller tokens.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising from extreme oversold levels, which could support a brief relief rally similar to what occurred in late January. This time, however, negative momentum signals have increased the chance of additional breakdowns on the chart.  Further, the 14-day moving average of volume (based on Coinbase exchange data provided by TradingView) ticked higher, which could be an initial sign of capitulation. Still, current volume levels are lower than June of last year when BTC settled at about $30,000.

However, since most investments might not guarantee 100% profit, that makes them to be risky. In a crypto winter, there are players in the market that are exposed to more losses than others. Some of them include: Short term investors Unskilled traders Decentralized Finance projects Crypto miners Short term Investors Some investors have a short-term plan for their investment. In a situation where the investment was followed by a season of continuous market downtrend known as crypto winter for a duration which sometimes might be up to 3 years: the investor will need to cash out. Cashing out means that all the losses can&apos;t be regained. This makes short-term investors at a very high risk of losing some parts of their investments during crypto winter. Unskilled traders The volatility of the cryptocurrency market makes it to be prone to more risk than the Forex market. This is because it is unregulated. Institutional investors can easily manipulate the market to ensure that their open positions in the leverage market ends favorably. This is because, the market is mostly controlled by the sellers and one with a high portfolio can easily change the direction of the market. This makes it important for traders to check the percentage of holdings in private wallets before trading on cryptocurrencies with low market capitalization.

42423401,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YyTh,1652225119,UST’s Bitcoin Reserve Too Late in Coming to Save Dollar Peg,"Luna Foundation Guard (LFG)'s proposed cryptocurrency reserve to guard against a collapse of the UST stablecoin came too late to guard against the past week's market turmoil.  As digital assets plunged along with traditional markets, the lack of an established formal structure in place for the project's forex reserve – designed to head off a crisis of confidence in UST's dollar peg – left the stablecoin vulnerable to a market rout.  Instead, officials found themselves scrambling to improvise solutions, offering some $1.5 billion of cryptocurrency loans to maintain the peg and later reportedly scrambling to line up fresh capital to back the project. (A spokesperson for the project didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.)  LFG accumulated more than $3 billion in its reserve, mostly in bitcoin (BTC), before UST first lost its 1:1 dollar peg on Sunday. However, the plan to connect the reserve to the blockchain with a smart contract to stabilize UST in a crisis was still weeks away from launching.  As of late Tuesday, UST was changing hands below 80 cents.  “The reserves had reached its desired size, but the infrastructure to utilize the reserves was not in place,” Vetle Lunde, analyst at the Norway-based crypto research firm Arcane Research, said. “Add a bleeding market and poor weekend liquidity to the mix, and you've got yourself a great opportunity to attack.”  UST is the largest algorithmic stablecoin, with a market capitalization that topped $18 billion before losing its peg to the dollar during the weekend, falling to as low as 68 cents on Monday, and its implosion sent shockwaves through the crypto market.  Read more: UST Stablecoin Veers Wildly From Dollar Peg. Here's the Latest  Algorithmic stablecoins are supposed to maintain their price peg through a system of trading incentives based on game theory. In the case of UST, that meant a decentralized blockchain protocol that involves creating and reducing supply of a related token, LUNA.  To address those fears, Terraform Labs, the firm that developed the Terra blockchain, coordinated with other investors to create an organization called the Luna Foundation Guard and started to accumulate a reserve that would support UST’s peg in a crisis.  LFG went on a buying spree, filling up the reserve with about $3.5 billion worth of crypto assets and became one of the largest single bitcoin holders on the market – but without a working system in place to deploy the reserve if a crisis happened.  Under a proposal by Jump Trading, a trading firm and an investor in LFG, the reserve would work like this: If the UST price fell below 98 cents, traders could swap UST to bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies in the reserve) at the price peg, creating demand for UST with an arbitrage incentive.  Read more: Bailout Fund, Backstop or Bouncy Ball? Here's How LFG's Bitcoin 'Reserve' Might Work  But the crisis happened before the system could be put in place.  Jose Maria Macedo, a council member of the Luna Foundation Guard, told CoinDesk the bitcoin swap mechanism was expected to be shipped by the end of next week by the developer team of Astroport, a token exchange built on the Terra blockchain.  Do Kwon, co-founder of Terra developer firm Terraform Labs, tweeted Monday that the testnet launch was a few weeks away.  There has been a lot of talk about the chokepoints of algorithmic stablecoins lately, with critics saying that they are inherently unstable in a market downturn, and vulnerable for market participants to exploit weak points in the design.  Sean Farrell, analyst at FundStrat, wrote in a report Tuesday that “we have ample reason to believe that the ‘run’ on UST was not a coincidence, but a deliberate exploit of UST’s (clearly fragile) architecture.”  According to Farrell, here is what led to the turmoil:  Before any panic, LFG removed on Saturday approximately $250 million from the UST-3pool on the stablecoin exchange platform Curve in two transactions, reportedly preparing for the launch of the upcoming 4pool.  Immediately following the first transaction, a seller swapped $85 million of UST for USDC on Curve, and pushed the UST-3pool, which held UST, USDC, USDT and DAI stablecoins, out of balance.  The seller dumped the UST at a pace that exceeded marginal demand, creating a positive feedback loop that brought the price of UST down to 98 cents.  LFG loaned $1.5 billion from the reserve to traders tasked to restore the peg, and almost succeeded in bringing UST back to $1.  When traditional markets opened Monday and continued to sell off, the original short seller apparently continued with its market swaps on Curve, knowing that few buyers would want to step in to save the algorithmic stablecoin.  Market makers started selling bitcoin to support UST, but then realized that it would only make things worse because falling prices were reducing the ammunition available to support the peg.  “It's reminiscent of [billionaire George] Soros' attack on the Bank of England in the 1990s, albeit attacking the UST peg is a far more low-hanging fruit for sufficiently capitalized entities to attack,” Arcane Research’s Lunde said. George Soros’s successful hedge fund bet against the British pound's exchange-rate mechanism made him a fortune on the trade.  UST's credibility  Even if LFG somehow manages to restore the peg, much damage has already been done to UST.  Investors are pulling money out of from Anchor, the largest yield-earning protocol built on the Terra blockchain that drove most of the demand to UST. Some 60% of its deposits have fled in just a few days, according to the protocol’s dashboard.  Kwon tweeted Tuesday that he was “close to announcing a recovery plan for UST,” while LFG is reportedly in talks to raise $1 billion to prop up its reserve.  Lunde said that LFG “may succeed in the short run” in bringing back UST to the peg, “but the long-term reputational effects and the trust in UST has surely gotten a hit by this.”  At press time, UST resumed its downward spiral, exchanging hands at 73 cents, while the price of LUNA stood at $13.68, dropping 66% in value in 24 hours.",NEGATIVE,BTC | LUNA,BTC | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/10/usts-bitcoin-reserve-too-late-in-coming-to-save-dollar-peg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4203373c9895eea462b82f9b1b26f4c6650ddeb7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Terra’s shaky stablecoin has struggled to maintain its $1 target since this weekend’s dips began; it reached as low as 68 cents Monday in a swan dive that prompted billion-dollar rescue efforts from reserve overseer, the Luna Foundation Guard.  Crypto market participants, regulators and critics are keenly watching UST’s flailing to measure up to the concept of algorithmic stablecoins, which rely on programs (over full collateral) to stay at $1 a coin.  “I think that simply illustrates that this is a rapidly growing product, and that there are risks to financial stability and we need a framework that's appropriate,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said of UST at a U.S. Senate hearing Tuesday.

In its simplest DeFinition, yield farming is an option that allows crypto investors to lock their holdings to reap the rewards later on. It is also a process that offers you an opportunity to earn a fixed or variable interest by investing crypto in a DeFi Market. Yield farming involves the lending of cryptocurrency through the Ethereum network. When banks offer loans via fiat money, they expect lenders to pay back the amount they lend out with a certain percentage of interest. It also follows this concept. It lends out a cryptocurrency that should be stored in a wallet following the DeFi protocols to get a return. DeFi Yield farming is carried out using ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. The rewards also come like an ERC-20 token as well. With a huge potential for this change in the nearest future, the Ethereum ecosystems carry out the majority of the yield farming transactions. How does DeFi yield farming Work? The first thing you need to do in DeFi yield farming is to add funds to the liquidity pool. These are important smart contracts that contain funds. These pools fuel a marketplace where users can easily exchange, lend tokens or borrow. Once you do this, you have become a liquidity provider officially. As a result of you sealing up your funds in the pool, you will be rewarded with generated f...",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | ICO,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/putting-pension-funds-into-defi-yield-farming-in-the-right-direction/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=putting-pension-funds-into-defi-yield-farming-in-the-right-direction,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Despite the miss, the miner posted record quarterly revenue, which rose 244% from the quarter a year ago, according to a statement.  “Our vertically integrated business strategy of owning, operating and manufacturing has accelerated our growth while helping insulate us from continuing global supply chain issues,” said CEO Jason Les in the statement.  The miner said mining revenue margin was $38.9 million (67% of mining revenue), which compares with $15.6 million (68% of mining revenue) for the same three-month period in 2021.  “The consistent mining revenue margin was primarily due to operating efficiencies driven by a greater number of new-generation miners currently being deployed at Riot’s Whinstone,” the company Riot bought last year, according to the statement.  Riot expects that by January 2023, total self-mining hash rate capacity will reach about 12.8 EH/s, staying consistent with previous guidance.

According to The Block, LFG will use the cash to help restore UST’s dollar peg. On Monday the algorithmic stablecoin fell as low as 60 cents amid broader crypto market turmoil. It has been around 90 cents on Tuesday.  Jump, Celsius, Jane Street and (perhaps) Alameda are reportedly in talks for a deal that will allow them to purchase LUNA, Terra's token, at a 50% discount. The tokens would be subject to a one-year lockup and vest monthly in year two, according to The Block. The firms did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  LFG did not comment on the funding round when reached by CoinDesk. Earlier Tuesday, Do Kwon, the founder of Terra creators Terraform Labs, tweeted: “Close to announcing a recovery plan for $UST. Hang tight.”  UST uses blockchain-based mint and burn mechanisms to, in theory, keep its price at exactly $1. It uses LUNA as a sort of shock absorber for UST volatility by guaranteeing that 1 UST can always be swapped for $1 in LUNA, which has a floating price.  When UST fell as low as 60 cents on Monday, it sent shockwaves through the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) industry, even sparking comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on the risks of crypto stablecoin bank runs.  As UST cratered and the price of LUNA dropped nearly 50%, LFG deployed over $1.5 billion of its newly formed bitcoin (BTC) reserves to defend UST’s peg.  With the help of professional market makers, the reserves appear to have successfully lifted the price of UST back up to 92 cents at press time.

Bitcoin's (BTC) price stabilized at around $30,000, which is the bottom of a year-long trading range. The cryptocurrency appears to be oversold, similar to what occurred in late January, which preceded a brief relief rally. Still, some analysts are cautious, pointing to risks in the stablecoin market.  On Tuesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen discussed ongoing distress in stablecoin UST during her testimony before a U.S. Senate panel. Yellen's comments came just hours after the purportedly dollar-pegged token plummeted to a low of $0.61 over the past 24 hours and at least one platform halted trading it.  ""I think that simply illustrates that this is a rapidly growing product, and that there are risks to financial stability, and we need a framework that's appropriate,"" Yellen said.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Most alternative cryptos (altcoins) outperformed bitcoin on Tuesday, suggesting a greater appetite for risk among short-term traders. For example, Polygon's MATIC token rallied by as much as 19% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 15% rise in SHIB and a 4% rise in BTC over the same period.  Typically, BTC declines by less than altcoins during market recoveries because of its lower risk profile relative to smaller tokens.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Exchange inflows spike  The chart below shows the recent spike in the transfer volume of BTC onto exchanges. The latest uptick is the highest since March 2020, when BTC fell by 50% during the coronavirus pandemic-induced sell-off.  Theoretically, exchange inflows suggest that traders are looking to sell their crypto assets, whereas outflows occur when traders are moving tokens to storage (digital wallets) and by doing so will incur a transaction cost.  The latest uptick in BTC exchange inflows could be a sign of capitulation, similar to what occurred at previous price bottoms. Further, bitcoin's trading volume exceeded the recent peak in January and sentiment indicators show extreme bearishness among traders. That typically results in a relief rally.  Bitcoin's extended drawdown  Bitcoin's drawdown, or the percentage decline from peak to trough, suggests a short-term price low, similar to what occurred in January. During bear markets, however, drawdowns can extend toward 60%-80%, compared with the current 53% peak-to-trough decline.  Bitcoin has experienced lower drawdowns since the 2018 crypto bear market, which is consistent with its long-term uptrend, defined by a series of higher price lows.  Still, unlike previous conditions, bitcoin's current correlation with the S&P 500 is at an all-time high. That means the cryptocurrency is more sensitive to traditional market influences such as interest rates and current events.

Shares fell 15.67% in post-market trading.  Revenue for the first quarter was $1.17 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.5 billion, according to FactSet. Coinbase also reported a quarterly net loss of $430 million, compared with a profit of $840 million in the fourth quarter.  Trading volume was $309 billion in the first quarter, missing estimates for $331.2 billion and down from $547 billion in the fourth quarter. Monthly transacting users (MTUs) were 9.2 million, compared with 11.4 million in the fourth quarter and analyst estimates of 9.9 million.  For the second quarter, Coinbase said it expects lower MTUs and total trading volume than the figures from the first quarter. The exchange also sees subscription and services revenue to be “similar to modestly lower” in the second quarter compared with the first quarter.  Separately, Coinbase also filed a shelf registration with the SEC, saying in a blog post that “while we have no immediate plans to offer securities at this time, by filing the shelf registration statement now, we will be able to offer and sell securities in the future should we choose to do so.”  Coinbase added the shelf filing gives the company a chance to issue securities in a faster timeframe, potentially a matter of days, giving it the ability to capitalize on volatility or “short windows of favorable market conditions should we choose to do so.”  Company's outlook  In a statement accompanying its earnings, Coinbase said that its outlook for 2022 remains largely unchanged and that it will continue to invest significantly in ""building the future of crypto.""  ""While we are navigating uncertain and volatile markets, we have a decade of experience to draw from and will continue to invest wisely to drive long-term growth,” the company said. “We continue to expect that during a prolonged and stressful scenario for our business, we will aim to manage our 2022 potential Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) losses to approximately $500 million on a full-year basis.”  Wall Street had been lowering its expectations for Coinbase heading into the earnings release as the exchange previously said it was expecting lower trading volumes in the first quarter because of a drop in crypto asset volatility and macroeconomic factors.  On its earnings call, Coinbase said it is working on connecting its NFT product to its retail app and Coinbase wallet. Additionally, Coinbase said it wants to eventually allow for users to complete NFT drops, mint their own tokens and decentralize the overall NFT experience.  Coinbase shares have fallen 71% year to date and dropped more than 50% in the last month alone as the prices of cryptocurrencies have tumbled.

Although LUNA is firm, the upside is capped and resistance at $45. Past Performance of Terra Terra has been decimated at spot rates, reading from the performance in the daily chart. The LUNA coin is down 43 percent in the last trading day alone and a massive 63 percent in the past trading week versus the USDT. Changing hands at $30, the LUNA token is at a new 2022 low and back to October 2021 territory. Terra Technical Analysis Terra is under immense liquidation pressure and LUNA coin is free-falling when writing. Although buyers are holding steady, soaking in sellers, the path of least resistance is defined. The immediate resistance is at $45, flashing with Q1 2022 lows. Therefore, every attempt to retest January 2022 lows could be an offer for sellers to unload while targeting this week&apos;s lows of $23, which coincides with September 2021 lows. Any surge above $45 may embolden buyers, a base for further recovery following sharp losses on May 9. What to Expect from LUNA?

Bitcoin CDD Inflow Indicator Jumps Up, Showing Long-Term Holders Have Been Selling As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, the recent price drop has pushed long-term holders towards selling their BTC. &apos;Coin days&apos; are the number of days a Bitcoin has remained dormant for. An example: if 1 BTC doesn&apos;t move for 5 days, it accumulates 5 coin days. When such a coin would be transferred or moved, its coin days would be &apos;destroyed&apos; as the number will reset back to zero. Related Reading | Bitcoin Slips Below $33k As Exchange Inflows Reach Highest Value Since July 2021 The &apos;coin days destroyed&apos; (CDD) metric naturally measures how many of these coin days are being destroyed in the entire market at any given time. A modification of this indicator, called the &apos;Bitcoin exchange inflow CDD,&apos; tells us about only those coin days that were destroyed by a transfer to exchanges. A high value of the inflow CDD generally suggests that long-term holders (who accumulate a large number of coin days) are moving their coins to exchanges. Investors usually transfer their Bitcoin to exchanges for selling purposes, so LTHs transferring a large number of their coins can be bearish for the price of the crypto.

42423392,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YyFh,1652206648,Past-Peak Inflation Might Be Misleading as Price Pressures Continue to Mount,"After months of rising inflation, a fresh U.S. government report this week may finally show a deceleration in price increases. But don't be fooled: It won't necessarily mean that upward pressures are easing.  The U.S. Labor Department is scheduled to publish on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for April.  Bitcoin (BTC) traders will be watching because the largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been swayed heavily by macroeconomic indicators recently. Specifically, the prospect of aggressive monetary tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve – in response to the highest inflation rate in four decades – helped send bitcoin this week to a 10-month low of around $30,000.  Forecasters expect headline inflation to have climbed 8.1% year over year in April, according to data from FactSet, which would be lower than the 8.5% reported for March.  But comparing the year-over-year change could be misleading because the CPI saw a big jump in April 2021. That data point could skew the interpretations of this week's report.  “There is the problem of year-over-year comparisons since last spring saw the big jump in inflation,” said John E. Silvia, former chief economist for Wells Fargo (WFC) and founder of Dynamic Economic Strategy.  Eric Winograd, senior vice president and director of developed-market economic research at AllianceBernstein, agrees. “The year-on year-numbers are going to come down, almost no matter what. That isn't particularly meaningful, because it doesn't tell us what's really going on with prices right now. It tells us what went on with prices a year ago,” he said.  Energy prices – in particular gasoline, which accounted for over half of the all-items monthly increase in March – have been more stable in April, one reason why economists expect headline inflation to have slowed.  Core inflation  Instead, traders will be more closely watching ""core"" inflation, which is expected to have increased 0.4% from March, signaling higher inflation on a month-to-month basis. Core inflation excludes any impact from food and energy prices, which tend to experience bigger swings than other goods and services.  “It's really the core inflation numbers that matter,” Winograd said. “There's a widespread perception that supply and demand are out of balance in the economy, and that's likely to keep core inflation relatively elevated.”  “Issues with rents may be showing up, and so the core CPI may not have peaked,” Silvia said.  According to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the main drivers for inflation right now are supply chain disruptions and consumer demand, but there is a new concern that wage pressure might start to appear. Last week, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. job market in April remained tight, which tends to drive wages up.  The U.S. employment cost index also showed that employment costs jumped by the most in two decades last month.  As for how Wednesday’s report will influence Federal Reserve officials, their minds might already be made up. Powell said last week that a 75 basis point (0.75 percentage point) rate hike is not being considered and that ""50 basis points should be on the table for the next couple meetings.”  “It takes something very dramatically different for them to change that path,” Winograd said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/10/past-peak-inflation-might-be-misleading-as-price-pressures-continue-to-mount,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae08c3abd2e4fae12e47ecf53447fda1a9e57f1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A letter sent to the White House on Tuesday is calling for a series of policies that will combat what the groups see as the adverse effects on communities hosting bitcoin miners including environmental degradation, noise pollution, electricity price hikes and hogging renewable energy resources.  The letter calls on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement stringent reviews on proof-of-work (PoW) mining operations; the Office of Management and Budget to create a registry of PoW miners to improve the industry's transparency; the Department of Energy to institute energy efficiency standards for PoW operations, study how to implement power density limits and how to protect ""low-cost public power allocations"" from being ""siphoned"" to PoW mining operations ""at the expense of local ratepayers""; and financial regulators to require greater transparency on miners' electricity use and climate pollution, limits on their environmental impact and fight ""misleading claims"" of bitcoin mining's environmental impact.  The letter was signed by Environmental Working Group and Greenpeace, which are also leading an advertising campaign to change bitcoin's code to proof-of-stake (PoS). The ad campaign is funded by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen.  Also signing the letter were Earthjustice, the Sierra Club and Seneca Lake Guardian. The latter two groups have gone to court a number of times to shut down Greenidge Generation's (GREE) bitcoin mine in New York.  In addition, the League of Conservation Voters, Friends of the Earth and the Milwaukee Riverkeeper signed the letter.  The groups have also appealed to state regulators for similar laws and regulations, a representative for the coalition said during a press conference on Tuesday.  Representatives of local NGOs and communities from New York, West Virginia, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Kentucky were at at the press conference.

42411120,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gizUh3,1652204776,Can You Really Build a ‘Crypto Empire’ in the Empire State?,"Every Monday night in Midtown Manhattan, members of New York City’s cryptocurrency scene meet up and talk shop over cocktails in an upscale food hall. Industry veterans mingle with newbies; business cards are exchanged, and new connections are made.  They’ve all come together for CryptoMondays, a long-running networking event for New York’s crypto enthusiasts. The Meetup group-turned-decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) started in New York in 2018 and has since expanded to 70 cities around the world, but the New York chapter remains the largest and most active.  CryptoMondays has been so successful that Imani Jones, the DAO’s director of events, decided it needed an expansion: In February, she organized a party at the New York Blockchain Center, complete with crypto-accepting vendors, an NFT exhibition and a band. She imagined it would be the “culmination of fashion, art, music and tech.”  “If you want to whet your appetite and find out what crypto is about, it’s perfect,” Jones said of the party, which she hopes will be the first in a monthly series. “It’s a space where you can ask basic questions.”  Jones, a Brooklyn local who got into crypto after deciding to start accepting crypto payments for her small business, is hopeful that New York City Mayor Eric Adams can make good on his plans to make the city the “center of the cryptocurrency industry.”  “I’m enthusiastic about Adams accepting his first three paychecks in bitcoin,” Jones said. “I think it shows he’s serious about making New York one of the hubs of crypto innovation.”  Adams’ promise to get paid in bitcoin (BTC) was one of many attempts to court the city’s crypto industry throughout his run for office, including hobnobbing with crypto elites at a fundraiser thrown by Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz.  But there’s a problem: New York has a laundry list of inherently unattractive qualities that have discouraged many in the crypto industry from setting up shop in the Empire State.  High taxes and a high cost of living put off companies that could theoretically work from anywhere. And, most significantly, a crushing and opaque regulatory regime crowned by the notoriously difficult-to-obtain BitLicense, a special license required to do business as a crypto company in New York.  The worst part? There’s pretty much nothing Adams can do to fix the situation because most of the hurdles are the result of state laws that, as mayor, he has no control over.  All Adams can really do to sweeten the pot is maintain friendly relationships with the industry and hope the perks of being in the Big Apple will do the rest. New York is the largest and wealthiest city in the United States and the financial capital of the world. It’s also an increasingly popular hub for tech companies ranging from small startups to titans like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL), making it a rich hunting ground for educated employees and deep-pocketed customers.  For a growing number of industry players, those perks make New York’s hoops worth jumping through.  They also explain why, despite seemingly doing everything in its power to scare the crypto industry off, New York has emerged as the implausible capital of crypto in the United States.  Crypto in the Big Apple  The cryptocurrency industry is global but has established a U.S. stronghold in New York – even despite the state’s regulatory challenges. Beyond sitting at the intersection of the technology and finance industries, New York provides a rich and deep pool of both qualified talent and wealthy potential customers.  Major players in the crypto space like NFT marketplace OpenSea, blockchain research firm Chainalysis, Ethereum-based tech company ConsenSys, and exchanges like Gemini have gotten their start in New York and maintained their headquarters in the city.  New York-based crypto startups (of which there are over 80) raised $6.5 billion last year, accounting for nearly half of all investments that poured into American crypto companies in 2021 and approximately 12% of all tech investments in New York City.  In the final quarter of 2021 alone, New York crypto companies including NYDIG and Fireblocks, which provides crypto custody services to institutional investors, raised a collective $3.2 billion – the largest quarter for crypto investments on the books.  Investors like Fred Wilson – the city’s leading venture capitalist who has made numerous bets on crypto – of Union Square Ventures also call NYC home. And, outside of the city, crypto companies like Digital Currency Group (the parent company of CoinDesk) and Celsius have offices in nearby Connecticut and New Jersey, respectively. DCG maintained its headquarters in New York until late 2021.  “New York City has been a pinnacle in the crypto industry,” said Michael Shaulov, CEO of Fireblocks, one of New York’s growing number of crypto “unicorns” (startups with a valuation above $1 billion).  “Being in NYC lends well to not only an unbeatable pool of talent, but the world’s biggest financial institutions. It has been very advantageous for our network of customers,” Shaulov added.  But crypto startups don’t need to be worth $1 billion to take advantage of the city’s benefits. Scrappy startups and would-be entrepreneurs have also found that the chance for success makes New York worth the trouble.  One of those is Jake Heid, who moved to New York from Philadelphia five years ago for college. Heid and his business partner, Ahmet Oz, met in the dormitories of Baruch College and decided to start a crypto company together – an NFT marketplace specifically for memes – inspired by what Heid described as the “hustler culture” of Baruch.  According to Heid, Baruch has been an incubator of sorts for the city’s crypto industry. He said his classmates have gone on to work for investment banks and start their own crypto projects, and many of Heid’s professors – including Lawrence Zicklin, for whom Baruch’s business school is named – have embraced crypto and made it a focal point of business classes.  “Almost all of them, even if they don’t understand it, think blockchain is the future,” Heid said.  Heid hasn’t been put off by the challenges of starting a crypto company in New York.  “I know it’s hard, but I want to make it work. I love New York,” Heid said. “There are a lot of justifiable complaints about regulation and taxes in New York, but I’m willing to pay more to live here. I think it’s worth it.”  Longtime crypto investor and founder of CryptoMondays Lou Kerner sees things differently. After living in New York for years, Kerner moved out of his New York apartment in June 2020 and has been living a lifestyle he described as “nomadic” ever since, though he says he still spends roughly half of his time in the city.  “New York is the financial center of the U.S. and arguably of the world,” Kerner said. “So it's not surprising even given the horrific regulatory framework in New York that it's a thriving ecosystem.”  But, when push comes to shove, Kerner said many would-be founders who may have gotten their start in New York, decide to leave the city to actually start their companies.  “This is the center of everything, of course people want to move here. But as they start focusing more on actually starting a business, they realize it’s a horrific place to be,” Kerner said.  Heid, however, doesn’t see himself becoming one of those leaving New York for Puerto Rico or Miami.  “A lot of companies don’t have loyalty to the city that built them,” Heid said. “That’s kind of disappointing, I think.”  Navigating New York’s muddy regulatory landscape  To do business in New York, crypto companies must obtain a BitLicense – a business license for virtual currency activities distributed by the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS), the same regulator that oversees New York’s banks.  The BitLicense is a golden ticket to operate in New York, but getting one is difficult, expensive and rare. Just 22 crypto companies currently hold a BitLicense. Only one new BitLicenses was issued in 2021, and only three have been issued in 2022 so far.  DFS's slow regulatory approval is a byproduct of the careful review process, according to a spokeswoman for the agency.  ""DFS's first-in-the-nation virtual currency regulation is designed to protect consumers; preserve safety and soundness of companies; ensure cybersecurity compliance; and root out financial crimes like money laundering and terrorist financing,"" a DFS spokeswoman told CoinDesk.  ""The Department is committed to keeping New York at the center of technological innovation and forward-looking regulation by hiring more experts to our virtual currency unit; streamline the BitLicense application process without sacrificing regulatory rigor; strengthening our supervision; and increasing our engagement with all stakeholders to ensure appropriate regulation and supervision in this fast evolving space,"" she added.  According to NYC-based attorney Max Dilendorf, whose practice helps wallets, exchanges and decentralized protocols enter U.S. markets, the BitLicense has made New York the most difficult state in the country in which to do business as a crypto company.  Dilendorf told CoinDesk the process of obtaining a BitLicense takes close to three years on average – something he and his clients find frustrating. The prospect of long wait times and mounting legal fees are enough to keep many crypto companies out of New York but, even for companies willing to pay up and be patient, additional requirements can make getting a BitLicense impossible for some.  “They need to have a compliance officer who has 15 years of experience,” Dilendorf said. “When a company runs a [money transmitting] operation in the States, they need to have two compliance officers, with one dedicated to the New York office. And it’s really hard to find people that have this much experience.” (Note: After the publication of this article, a spokeswoman for NYDFS told CoinDesk there is no mandated experience requirement for a compliance officer.)  “The whole thing is – I don’t want to say that it’s a joke, but it’s a joke,” Dilendorf added.  David Yermack, chair of NYU Stern School of Business’ finance department, has been teaching crypto since 2014. After learning about bitcoin in 2011, Yermack has watched the crypto industry ebb and flow in New York for the past decade.  “Some of the earliest [crypto] ventures like Charlie Shrem’s BitInstant were in New York,” Yermack said, referencing an early bitcoin exchange that operated between 2011 and 2014. “But what you then saw was a very counterproductive over-regulation of the industry.”  “The infamous BitLicense was one of the least successful regulatory things I’ve ever seen. It just grossly overreached,” Yermack added. “It’s a crushing piece of regulation that has chased a lot of people out of New York … the burden it places on people in New York is grotesque and completely unnecessary.”  Crypto regulation in New York is the strictest in the U.S., especially compared to more crypto-friendly states like Texas and Wyoming, which have moved quickly to create a regulatory atmosphere that is welcoming to the crypto industry.  Adding to the crypto industry’s hurdles in New York, however, is that DFS isn’t the only regulator in the state that has an opinion on crypto.  The New York State Attorney General’s office (NYAG), helmed by Letitia James, has also turned its eye towards the crypto industry.  Under New York’s strict blue sky laws – which give the attorney general’s office broad powers to investigate and prosecute suspected securities fraud – James’ office has gone after major players in the crypto space, including stablecoin issuer Tether. Last October, the NYAG also ordered two crypto companies to shut down operations in New York.  Andres Munoz, a crypto-focused litigation partner at Romano Law, says the AG’s aggressive stance towards crypto companies is relatively new.  “It used to be that [NYAG] would defer to DFS because they came up with the BitLicense,” Munoz said. “But in the past few years, the attorney general has taken increasingly aggressive steps to regulate many of these cryptocurrency platforms.”  “Essentially, the AG has put these virtual currency businesses on notice that obtaining a BitLicense is not enough,” Munoz said.  The regulatory hurdles faced by crypto companies in New York are the result of state-level activities – which means Eric Adams has little to no authority to change them.  “Municipal government has nothing to do with this,” Yermack said.  Andrew Rasiej, chairman of the New York Tech Alliance and co-chair of Mayor Adams’ tech transition committee, seconded this.  “New York City has zero say over the rules or policies associated with crypto. New York State obviously has a little bit more say, but as far as the city of New York is concerned, there really isn’t much it can do,” Rasiej said.  “It can encourage crypto by inviting firms and investors to recognize New York as a center for crypto development,” Rasiej added. “But as far as infrastructure goes, there’s not much it can do.”  If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere  For crypto founders willing to jump through New York’s hoops, however, the intense regulatory requirements offer companies some perks, including access to New York’s wealthy population and a reputation for being compliant with regulators (i.e., safe).  And because the process is difficult, it weeds out some of the competition.  “The companies that have had the resources and decided to go through the trouble of getting [the BitLicense] have benefited because of it,” said Omid Malekan, who teaches blockchain technology at Columbia’s business school.  “They can turn around and tell the market, their customers and other U.S. regulators, ‘Hey, we have the hardest-to-get crypto license in America.’”  Thomas Hook, chief compliance officer for BitStamp USA, which has had a BitLicense since 2019, said the license – and the regulatory compliance it indicates – is a “feather in the cap” for his company.  “New York is a very exacting regulator,” Hook added. “They have detailed requirements, which is helpful. When you know the rules, you're going against, it's easier to comply with them and hold yourself accountable.”  Hook, who started his career in the cybercrimes unit of the New York County District Attorney’s office, said New York regulators have to be strict because New York is the center of the global financial market.  BitStamp’s access to the New York markets has, according to Hook, offered the company access to “a huge hub of talent, customers, and partners.”  Malekan pointed out that NYC-based crypto companies are raising enormous sums from investors, most of which will go towards hiring people.  “There’s a huge labor shortage in crypto. The opportunities are there. The wages are very high, very competitive,” Malekan said. “Eric Adams is smart – the job of any mayor is to create an environment for economic growth with high wage, high quality jobs.”  “There’s going to be a turf war, and we’re going to see more and more cities and states fighting to get a piece of that pie,” Malekan concluded.  For some, the grass in Miami grows greener  Miami has emerged as the biggest competitor – at least domestically – to New York as a hub for the crypto industry.  Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has made attracting crypto companies to Miami a priority for his administration, and he has been successful. Last summer, Blockchain.com announced that it would be moving its U.S. headquarters from New York City to Miami, with promises to add 300 high-paying jobs.  Crypto companies like eToro and FTX US have announced plans to expand their presence in Miami, with the latter even buying the naming rights to the former American Airlines Arena.  In addition to comparatively lax regulation, Suarez has pointed out that it’s simply cheaper to do business in Florida than New York – which he believes is a big draw for some crypto companies.  “There is a cost of living differential, which is about two-to-one right now,” Suarez told NPR last December. “It’s twice as expensive to live in New York as it is in Miami.”  Suarez said the influx of crypto companies and other mainstream financial firms like Citadel Securities into Miami has brought with it $1.2 trillion worth of assets under management (AUM) since 2019 – an enormous boon for any city’s economy, but particularly so for Miami’s, which was 60% service-sector based prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.  And Florida isn’t the only state competing with New York for the crypto crown: Texas, Wyoming, Tennessee and other states – as well as Puerto Rico – have all taken steps towards establishing crypto hubs of their own.  Beyond U.S. borders, countries like Singapore and Malta have emerged as crypto hotspots. In January, Hong Kong-based crypto exchange Xapo announced it would be renouncing its BitLicense to focus on its international products.  But it’s not just crypto companies that New York stands to lose: Crypto investors are also leaving the state in droves to escape New York’s high tax rates.  “If you’re trading crypto assets, you’ve probably outperformed your peers, which means you care more about things like income taxes – I think that’s part of why we’ve seen this migration to places like Miami and Puerto Rico,” Malekan said.  The ‘city that never sleeps’ isn’t sleeping on crypto  Though New York’s regulatory requirements might be onerous enough to push away some companies, the reality is that the city’s crypto industry is continuing to grow despite them.  “New York is, and has always been, a mainstage player in the crypto industry,” said Jackie Zupsic, head of communications and co-chair of the crypto practice and fintech group at Tusk Strategies.  “It goes without saying that New York is the financial capital of the world,” said Walter Hessert, head of strategy at Paxos, a New York-based crypto firm that provides brokerage and settlement services to financial institutions.  Paxos was the first crypto company to receive regulatory approval from NYDFS. Hessert said that being compliant with regulations is key to Paxos’ mission, and is critical for Paxos’ clients, many of whom are also regulated by NYDFS.  Hessert said that New York’s history of being an exacting regulator has set a “gold standard” for financial regulation, including crypto.  “Regardless of what you think about the BitLicense, what I’m seeing is New York continuing to thrive,” Zupsic said. “Few places rival New York when it comes to talent and capital availability.”  “Now New York will just need to figure out how to keep people there,” Zupsic said.

42421600,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoiD7,1652204166,"Bitcoin Is Down, but You Don't Have to Be","Bitcoin has been in a five-day rout that has brought its price, which is maybe what we care about most, to its lowest level since last July. Other coins are seeing similar gutting, amid a larger economic fallout.  The Wall Street Journal reports:  “Cryptocurrencies have fallen in lockstep with the broader stock market in recent days. The trend for bitcoin and other digital assets to fall alongside stocks is one that has become more pronounced in recent years, investors say, as traditional money managers such as hedge funds and family offices have entered the space. Such funds may be more likely to sell crypto holdings during periods of volatility rather than hold them.”  This nut graph (journo speak for a summary) gets at the changing conditions of the crypto industry in relation to the wider economy. Public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are open markets. They are experiments with financial and computer systems to open a wide array of economic and cultural activity to anyone, similar to how the internet leveled access to information and social media flattened social hierarchies.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Crypto is often seen as a retail man’s game. You can buy bitcoin from banks, brokerages and trading apps like Robinhood – with no pre-approval or advising necessary. And so people do. Some small investors have a game plan: They dollar-cost average (or make consistent purchases over a length of time regardless of the market price to try to avoid “timing the market”). Others “ape in,” spurred by a sense of “missing out” as a market’s Ponzi-like mechanisms kick into gear.  See also: Bitcoin Holding Support at $30K; Resistance at $35K  But there are now big, big, big players in crypto. These are individuals or institutions that have “size,” or an amount of capital that can move markets or cause slippage depending on how they play. A few “crypto-native” names: Alameda Research, a trading outfit co-founded by crypto luminary Sam Bankman-Fried, hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz.  It might be easier to list traditional firms that aren’t involved in crypto, in at least some way. Most notably, Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway isn’t seeking crypto exposure.  It’s not always easy to tell who loses most when markets contract. We, or at least I, have a tendency to sentimentalize the economy knowing how people’s retirements and livelihoods are tied up in capital. And so “corrections” appear to be more personal than just the mechanizations of money. People are making decisions to buy or sell or hold, after all, often based on incomplete, contradictory or confusing information.  It seems clear enough, however, that the market turmoil is tethered to the Federal Reserve’s commitment to raise interest rates amid a period of surging inflation. New York Times columnist Jeff Sommer said this policy decision is “stunning,” considering the past two decades of “easy money,” where interest rates were kept low to encourage people to move into riskier investments to find yield.  The economy is now slowing by design. And investors “don’t know how to react,” Sommers writes. It’s a difficult play especially because it’s never clear what direction things could move, or what other events – like a global pandemic, a European war, worsening geopolitical tension between the U.S. and China, lockdowns – could take place.  The Wall Street Journal cites analysts who say prices could return to “pre-pandemic” levels or lower, after a two-year rally that brought the market for tech stocks up 60% and crypto astronomically high.  See also: Wipe Away Your Tears: Crypto Is About More Than Prices | Opinion  So, decisions need to be made to potentially protect your wealth as decisions are being made to theoretically protect the economy. Some people have it incredibly hard: Do Kwon, founder of the breakout crypto ecosystem Terra, is working to salvage his risky algorithmic stablecoin after it lost its one-to-one peg to the U.S. dollar. Terra’s backers had previously planned to purchase $3 billion in bitcoin as a backstop, and yesterday took the incredible move to sell a significant chunk of it as UST, the stablecoin, dropped as low as $0.61. CoinDesk columnist David Z. Morris called this “Kwontitative easing,” playing on one of the Fed’s generous policies to spur economic growth through spending.  Michael Saylor, CEO of a software company turned quasi-bitcoin fund, also made a decision. His MicroStrategy has bought more than 129,000 bitcoins at an average price of $30,700 since August 2020, and has taken out loans on a portion of those assets to buy more bitcoin. As bitcoin falls below Saylor’s purchase price, he may have cause to sell (in part to collateralize his company’s loans). Today, he said he will never sell – following the popular mantra among bitcoiners to “hodl,” thinking that, long-term, all assets will depreciate against the hard-capped BTC.  There’s a chance that you, dear reader, may also need to make decisions. It may not always be clear what to do, and who knows what your financial situation looks like or will look like if the economy worsens. As Sommers notes, “The current situation is anything but normal.”  He’s putting his money in “broadly diversified index funds that track the overall market,” which are being hit as hard as anything else but historically have been safe plays.  Lily Francus, an exceedingly bright market commentator and “quantitative memeticist,” noted that even if crypto is tracking tech stocks now, these digital assets are fundamentally different because they don’t pay dividends or offer future cash flow. Crypto assets are basically risk embodied, floating signifiers that move based on people’s desire or fear. And so they could rise or fall accordingly, she said. The direction is as open as the market.  That may not seem like sage advice, but at a moment where all things seem chaotic and out of your hands, it’s worth evaluating what you may hold. You cannot make decisions for other people, you cannot change the Fed’s policy, but you could act with conviction.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/10/bitcoin-is-down-but-you-dont-have-to-be,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ffe4ca0af0cd7da88a2cb08f6f0f3b9f3a7c6cf-2048x1356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411122,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gizUkM,1652202065,Argentina Bears Down on Crypto Miners Amid Power Shortage,"BitPatagonia, one of the largest registered crypto mining companies in Argentina, was recently hit with a 400% increase in its electricity bill, the result of a policy change affecting miners there, the startup’s industrial director, Pablo Holmes, told CoinDesk.  BitPatagonia’s mine is in Tierra del Fuego on Argentina’s southernmost tip, where the cold climate supports up to 22 crypto mining companies, local sources told CoinDesk. But the government isn’t happy about the consumption of energy by mining companies. So in January, it imposed a 170% increase in the wholesale electricity rate of Tierra del Fuego, targeting digital asset miners specifically.  Argentina’s government, alerted by the growing crypto mining activity, began an investigation in December to identify mining companies and measure their energy consumption. The goal, it said at the time, was for the miners to “face the payment of the price of energy equivalent to the cost of supply, being inequitable that they pay the price of a residential user.”  Argentina’s government pays big subsidies to different entities that provide electricity and gas, ultimately reducing the final rate for taxpayers. In February, the budget for energy subsidies increased by 207% compared with the same month of 2021, according to a report published by the Argentine Association of Budget and Public Financial Administration.  The country, at the same time, is also running out of U.S. dollars to continue importing energy, as its reserves averaged $38.5 billion in March, according to Argentina's Central Bank. Net reserves are $1.65 billion, and liquid reserves are minus $1.9 billion, local investment firm Allaria reported recently.  Electricity subsidies are a great opportunity for miners taking advantage of residential rates, but not for registered mining companies, which have to pay industrial rates.  Moreover, Holmes added, the control measures taken by the government don't encourage companies and residents mining crypto off the radar of the tax collection agency, AFIP, to register with the government.  “Nobody is going to say that he is illegally mining in industrial parks, offices or homes just because he receives a letter from a public office. It is like responding to a letter from the central bank asking if your address works as a cave [an illegal exchange house] for buying and selling dollars. However, we understand that the officials are making their best efforts,” he added.  Moisés Sorloza, Tierra del Fuego’s Energy Secretary, recently said that the province’s government has gathered data from registered farms, but he also acknowledged there are “micro miners” working in homes that still need to be regulated nationwide.  He added that because of its “obsolete” electric system, Tierra del Fuego has “no way it can sustain the increase of high-energy consumption enterprises.”  Due to rate increases and what he calls unfair competition between registered and illegal miners, BitPatagonia is considering leaving Argentina to set up operations in other countries, Holmes said, without specifying a destination.  Santiago Miranda, CEO of CriptoLab, a crypto mining company registered in the central province of Córdoba, said the company pays the full electricity rate but that mining is still “very profitable.”  When talking about illegal mining and regulatory attempts, however, he warned that “no one is going to provide information unless there is some benefit for the taxpayer.” CriptoLab is working with different provincial governments to create a “friendly framework that is not only for collection.”  Low prices, high costs  According to the Argentina-based data-checking organization Chequeado, a 300 kilowatt-hour (kWh) monthly residential bill costs $5 in Buenos Aires, but averages $30 in the U.S.  That difference attracts many Argentines to turn to crypto mining and earn income in a foreign currency, amid constant devaluations of Argentina’s peso and inflation that exceeds 55%.  Without being registered as official miners, Manuel and Pedro – who requested their full names be withheld to remain anonymous – are friends and businessmen who five months ago invested $16,000 to mine ether in the center of Buenos Aires, Argentina’s capital.  “With one day of mining, we cover the surplus we receive in the monthly electricity rate for the activity,” they said, detailing that they receive an income of $30 per day.  Regarding the potential taxes or energy restrictions, the miners said that they aren't too concerned because “regulations will run behind technology, which is always one step ahead.”  Manuel and Pedro plan to recover their investment in 15 months. Although so far they have kept their earnings on crypto, eventually they plan to convert to fiat in one of the illegal exchange offices known as “caves” that trade at the unofficial U.S. dollar rate and are usually hidden behind traditional businesses, such as jewelry stores.  Lucía, who requested that her last name be withheld, started mining in January and found an alarming increase in her electricity rate. Despite the subsidies, the cost tripled from $8 to $25.  “When I received the electricity bill, I was worried. But I am confident in the long-term investment,” she told CoinDesk. After choosing to mine ether, she now plans to recover her initial investment of $4,800 in eight months.  Lucía, Manuel and Pedro raised concerns regarding the change in the ether protocol, but still hope to recover their initial investments before Eth 2.0 comes into play.  A mainstream niche  Home crypto mining has become so common in Argentina that even mining influencers have appeared, explaining to novices how to acquire machinery and make the necessary investments.  Valeria Frías has more than 12,000 followers on Instagram and receives inquiries daily. In her spare time, she assembles, configures and sells processing equipment for crypto mining.  Frías made an initial investment of $20,000 in four pieces of equipment and recovered it in nine months after mining ether. Aware of the protocol change, she now plans to start mining other coins, such as ravencoin, conflux or ethereum classic.  “We have a huge tax burden and people are always looking for an activity that gives them profitability so as to be able to maintain their standard of living, to beat inflation or to avoid falling below the poverty level,” Frías said.  Among her clients, adults over 80 years of age stand out, because they are seeking to generate an extra income on top of the average retirement salary, whose minimum was $153 in April.  For Argentine retirees, mining can be an even more profitable activity than for the rest of the population, because the national government may subsidize between 60% and 100% of their electricity bills.  Low pensions are not the only problem in Argentina's economy. According to the latest report from the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC), 37.3% of the population is under the poverty index.  “A lot of people turned to cryptocurrency mining because it's like an escape,” Frias concluded.

Lawmakers from the European Parliament have said that crypto-asset providers shouldn't be authorized to offer services in the bloc if they’re from shady jurisdictions like Panama, but Commission officials, mediating late-stage talks on the law known as the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), don’t agree.  “No such prohibition exists in other sectoral legislation,” and it’s not clear why they should apply only to crypto, said the paper, produced to influence talks taking place between governments and lawmakers that are seeking to hash out a final version of the MiCA law.  “Such a prohibition … might create barriers to the provision of services in the EU and therefore might be seen as constituting a breach of international commitments taken” at the World Trade Organization, it added.  Officials “have serious doubts about the feasibility and proportionality” of a blacklist of non-compliant crypto asset service providers, which lawmakers wanted to see maintained by the EU securities-market watchdog ESMA.  Read more: EU Lawmakers to Vote on Blocking Anonymous Crypto Payments, Documents Show  The Commission paper said the criteria for the list were unclear, and that any such initiative would be better left to a wider redraft of anti-money laundering (AML) laws that covers sectors such as banking and the legal profession.  “We would urge the [European Parliament] to reconsider and if still deemed necessary await discussions on the AML Regulation,” the paper said.  The Commission document is badged as a “non-paper,” meaning it does not represent a formal view of the institution. The Parliament voted on its favored version of the draft law back in March, narrowly avoiding restrictions on energy-intensive proof-of-work technology that some characterized as a bitcoin (BTC) ban.  The EU blacklists jurisdictions which it views as encouraging tax avoidance or having sloppy money-laundering controls.

Valuation was not disclosed.  Haun, a Coinbase (COIN) director and former U.S. prosecutor, left a16z in December and raised $1.5 billion in March to split between an early-stage and an “accelerator” fund. Last week, Haun Ventures announced its first investment, leading a $50 million round for NFT tooling protocol Zora at a $600 million valuation.  “We have a vision of making Web 3 accessible and intuitive and simple for mainstream creators and mainstream fan bases,” Highlight co-founder and CEO Nathaniel Emodi told CoinDesk in an interview. “As a fan, there’s always been this idea of fan clubs. And we think with Highlight and with Web 3 you could build the music fan club of the future.”  Other participants in the funding round included venture capital firms 1kx, Polygon Studios, Coinbase Ventures, SciFi VC and Thirty Five Ventures.  How Highlight works  Highlight offers an end-to-end solution for creators wanting to build a community without the need for crypto or coding experience.  With a few clicks, creators can customize the visual appearance of their community, deploy their own smart contracts on the Polygon blockchain, design and mint NFTs and then sell or distribute the tokens to fans through a variety of distribution channels. An example would be a musician creating QR codes for fans to claim or purchase NFTs at live events, explained Emodi. There’s also the ability to create token-gated Discord channels, merchandise sales and access to media content.

Africa is a fast-growing region for crypto, with 1,200% growth in the market in the year ended June 2021 to $106 billion, according to the World Economic Forum. Last month, the Central African Republic adopted bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender, the second country in the world to do so after El Salvador.  “As Paradigm’s first investment in Africa, we couldn’t be more excited to partner with the Jambo team in this next phase of growth,” said Paradigm partner Casey Caruso. “We see massive Web 3 potential in Africa and it’s clear that James and Alice are uniquely positioned to build a durable on-ramp for the continent.”  In November, Paradigm launched a record-breaking $2.5 billion crypto fund, topping the prior $2.2 billion record held by Andreessen Horowitz.  Jambo raised $7.5 million in a seed round in February, with Coinbase (COIN) and Alameda Research among the backers.

Co:Create Raises $25M to Help NFT Projects Launch Tokens,"Non-fungible token (NFT) startup Co:Create has raised a $25 million seed round to help NFT collections launch their own tokens, the company announced Tuesday.  The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) with participation from Gary Vaynerchuk’s VaynerFund, Packy McCormick’s Not Boring Capital, Amy Wu and RTFKT.  The startup uses its “factory method” protocol to generate customizable tokens and treasuries for participating projects, allowing royalties to be paid out in that native token with a decentralized exchange (DEX) swapping method, according to a press release.  “We want the NFT to do more than just sit in your wallet, in a thoughtful way that makes it a utility and not a security,” Tara Fung, CEO of Co:Create, told CoinDesk in an interview. “I think we need more guidance from the SEC and other regulatory bodies. I'm hopeful that in the future we'll get more clarity and less ambiguity.”  The push for token-tied NFTs comes in the wake of ApeCoin’s ongoing success, which is the token tied to Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT collections.  ApeCoin (APE) launched in mid-March, with a portion airdropped to NFT holders of various Yuga Labs collections.  Following some early price volatility, the token now sports a nearly $3 billion market cap. Yuga Labs used the token for its recent “Otherside” land sale, which priced NFTs tied to virtual plots of land exclusively in ApeCoin for its initial sale.

42395424,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASx111,1652190198,Cipher Raises Year Hashrate View While Cutting Power Guidance,"Bitcoin miner Cipher Mining (CIFR) increased its expectations for the total hashrate capacity for the remainder of the year by 0.5 exahash/second (EH/s), according to a Tuesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  In its annual earnings report for 2021, Cipher Mining had said it expected to deploy a total of 8.5 EH/s, with 7.2 EH/s going to its self-mining operations, by the end of 2022. The miner now expects 9 EH/s in total hashrate, 7.5 EH/s of which will go towards its own mining operations.  The increased hashrate is due to improved machine allocation from MicroBT, according to the filing. The firm has contracts for 27,000 rigs with Bitmain and 60,000 rigs from MicroBT, CEO Tyler Page said in Tuesday's earnings conference call.  Cipher is ""having conversations"" with virtually every mining rig manufacturer, including new entrants like Intel, Page said.  At the same time, Cipher Mining reduced its expectations of power capacity. The firm expected to have 405 megawatts (MW) of total capacity by the end of 2022, 305MW of which would go towards its self-mining operations, but now has updated its forecast to 345MW, with 275MW used for self-mining, the filing said.  The filing also shows that phase 2 of development of Cipher Mining's Bear and Chief facilities has been pushed back to 2023. Page said during the earnings conference call that the Bear and Chief facilities operate as ""front-of-meter system"" where the power must pass through an electric meter before reaching a consumer. Owing to this setup, Cipher and its joint venture (JV) partners work with transmission and distribution service providers for their power supply. These providers informed the company that the required modification of the substation infrastructure needed to be pushed back out until 2023 or mid-2023, which affected the Phase 2 timeline.  However, the CEO said in Tuesday's call that the electricity capacity is more than enough to host machines that are scheduled for delivery throughout the year. The facilities could accommodate more mining rigs, should the firm find opportunity to buy them at competitive pricing, he said.  Cipher Mining closed its first loan to finance the purchase of equipment, it said earlier in May, securing $46.9 million for its Alborz facility from BlockFi. The firm believes lenders are and will continue to ""be comfortable"" with Cipher Mining's model, given its low costs, despite unfavorable market conditions, Page said.  Given its current contracts, the firm has anticipates its cost of electricity to be $0.0273 per kilowatt hour and the cost of machines to be $45.01 per TH/s, according to the filing.  The firm believes lenders are and will continue to ""be comfortable"" with Cipher Mining's model, given its low costs, despite unfavorable market conditions, and expects multiple debt deals in the future.  Shares of Cipher slumped about 46% on Tuesday, underperforming its mining peers, which have somewhat recovered from a brutal selloff. Meanwhile, bitcoin finally caught some bids and rose above $31,000.  UPDATED (May 10 17:58 UTC): Updated headline, fifth and last bullet point to add comments from conference call about the cut to power capacity expectations, as well as share price performance.

Problems with existing weather information technology Weather intelligence platforms collect weather-related information from distributed radar and satellite systems. While this is useful for gathering data from remote corners of the world, it limits the scope of weather forecasts to wider geographic regions, such as cities and states. These generic weather forecasts don&apos;t provide details on how the weather will change in a specific street or neighborhood. But having this type of information empowers businesses to make more informed decisions. Why industries need better weather data Weather data is collected in various ways globally, but the most popular data collection methods are satellites and hyperlocal sensors. While satellites cover a wide range of geography, they compromise accuracy in specific areas that hyperlocal data can mediate. Hyperlocal data collection is the most efficient form of data collection. One of the largest industries relying on weather updates is the agriculture sector, and the more detailed the weather forecast, the better.

""MicroStrategy has a $205 million term loan and needs to maintain $410 million as collateral,"" said Saylor. Linking to his company's Q1 investor presentation, Saylor noted that of MicroStrategy's 129,218 bitcoin (BTC) stash, 115,109 (or more than $3 billion at current prices) remains unencumbered.  Bitcoin would need to fall all the way to $3,562 before the company would run out of enough of the crypto to pledge for that loan, but even at that point, MicroStrategy could post some other collateral, said Saylor. His implication is that theoretically there's almost no price low enough at which his firm would need to be a forced seller of bitcoin.  The sharp downturn in the crypto market – which last night saw bitcoin fall below $30,000 for the first time since July 2021 – had ramped up chatter about MicroStrategy facing a margin call. Indeed, on the company earnings call last week, outgoing CFO Phong Le said as much, suggesting about $21,000 as a trigger point.  The Saylor tweet and presentation slides appear to make clear, however, that the company for now has an overwhelming amount of unencumbered bitcoin available as additional collateral.

The firm will also kick off a roadshow in Dubai to court potential backers, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk.  The initial SPiCE I fund was a $50 million tokenized vehicle (meaning the fund’s assets were turned into tokens to provide liquidity to investors) that started raising money in 2017 when blockchain technology was generally used in financial verticals. The fund’s portfolio included three companies that went public last year: digital security platform INX Limited (INXD), online lottery platform Lottery.com (LTRY) and crypto exchange Bakkt (BKKT).  SPiCE II is launching after blockchain use has spread to a wider range of industries, including gaming, retail, healthcare and supply chain management.  “The focus of [SPiCE II] is the same. We invest in companies that are building significant pieces of the blockchain ecosystem, and companies that are building infrastructure. Companies that are building on distributed ledger technology to significantly change industries,” Tal Elyashiv, co-founder and managing partner of SPiCE VC, told CoinDesk in an interview. “ [But] the breadth is much bigger. So we expect more diversity in SPiCE II versus SPiCE I.”  SPiCE II’s structure and focus  SPiCE II has a more traditional venture capital structure with a tokenized portion, the size of which will be determined by investor interest, explained Elyashiv. The larger size of the fund means SPiCE VC can take the lead role in more rounds and invest in more companies than with the SPiCE I.  Whereas SPiCE I raised funding from family offices, small funds of funds and high net worth individuals, SPiCE II is targeting the participation of institutional investors. SPiCE VC has already seen investor interest in Dubai, where SPiCE has an office, making it the natural kickoff location for the roadshow.  “The environment in Dubai is very vibrant. We’ve seen a lot of deals move relatively quickly there, so it’s a good place to start,” said Elyashiv. “Dubai is also driving growth in terms of local adoption of blockchain. So there’s much more awareness of blockchain [there] in a broader scope than just crypto.”  The second SPiCE fund is launching as crypto venture capital investments continue at a steady pace after last year’s record-breaking fund launches from Andreessen Horowtiz and Paradigm, despite the recent decline in digital asset prices.

The agenda, known as the Queen's Speech, is usually presented by the 96-year-old monarch, who was unable to participate due to ""episodic mobility problems.""  One new law aims at ""supporting the safe adoption of cryptocurrencies,"" a government briefing published Tuesday alongside the speech said. A separate Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill will create ""powers to more quickly and easily seize and recover crypto assets, which are the principal medium used for ransomware.""  There will also be a civil forfeiture power for those who cannot be criminally prosecuted.

Although it is a cryptocurrency exchange token, global market pressure cannot stop or ignore any cryptocurrency project. However, it is at the fall of the entire crypto market that you can find strong altcoins in which investors are interested. KCS is one of them. If we analyze the KCS price fall wave from April 2022, we can see that investors are very reluctant to sell it. https://www.tradingview.com/x/aja3bh2S/ Compare the April wave of fall with the January one. In January, sellers managed to lower the KCS price by 35% thanks to one weekly candle. It took sellers 6 weeks to achieve the same result in April. In addition, the reluctance of investors to give their medium-term and long-term positions on KCS is noticeable, and the fact of updating the local low. On 9 May 2022, sellers updated the local low from January 2022. Though, after this, the price fall did not continue due to stop orders from buyers. This means that most KCS investors were holders and for them, there was no clear signal to sell. In the worst-case scenario in the cryptocurrency market, we allow the price to fall by 15%.

The fund is backed by investors with large holdings of the network’s native token, FLOW, as well as equity in Dapper Labs itself. They include Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Coatue, Union Square Ventures, Greenfield One, Liberty City Ventures and CoinFund, among others.  The fund is the largest ecosystem backing of its kind, and will go towards boosting “gaming, infrastructure, decentralized finance, content and creators” in the Flow ecosystem, according to a press release.  “It’s a diverse fund in a few ways, the first being in terms of kind of location, we’ve got Asia, Europe and North America covered,” Dapper Labs Chief Business Officer Mik Naayem told CoinDesk in an interview. “But also in terms of expertise and accelerators, from a16z down the list, it makes us well-rounded.”  Will Flow grow?  Flow’s blockchain is known for snappy transaction speeds and low costs, with most of its traffic being to Dapper’s own suite of NFT platforms – NBA Top Shot, NFL ALL DAY and UFC Strike.  The fund looks to reach beyond just Dapper’s own products, attracting developers to the blockchain at a time when Ethereum alternatives remain in competition for their piece of the NFT pie.  Naayem predicts the space is moving towards a “winner take most” scenario, with the best technology likely to attract the lion’s share of users.  The announcement comes in a macro NFT environment that’s quieted down in previous months, or at least compared to when Dapper Labs raised $250 million at a $7.6 billion valuation in September. Coatue led the raise, which also included a16z.  Read more: Dapper Labs Said to Reach $7.6B Valuation in $250M Funding Round  NBA Top Shot volumes have mostly decreased month-by-month since the highs of last spring, though usage on the platform continues to grow.  “Although we’ve seen the overall volumes go down, there’s been an uptake in usage,” Naayem said. “What we’re seeing with NFTs right now is probably an overcorrection from when enthusiasm outpaced where the industry used to be.”",POSITIVE,FLOW,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | FLOW,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/10/dapper-labs-debuts-725m-ecosystem-fund-for-flow-blockchain-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/770e032fb59f10c8a3ad72396bd1820690a76a0e-3266x2333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Boba will also provide a 25% discount for users that opt to pay in BOBA. This would allow the usage of BOBA as the fee token for all Boba services. Users will still have the option to use ETH for gas payments, however.  Boba Network scales Ethereum with fast transactions and fees up to 60x lower. It previously raised $45 million in a Series A round of funding at a valuation of $1.5 billion.  Layer 2 networks require users to hold two tokens — the native coin, along with some ETH for paying gas, or transaction, fees during the token-bridging process that links the network to Ethereum. Previously, only ETH was used for gas fees, with BOBA used for voting and delegating votes in the BobaDAO.  “Providing options to pay in BOBA and Ethereum is a layer 2 world first and a big win for Boba Network users,” explained Alan Chiu, founder of Boba Network, in a prepared statement.  “It also scales the native token to another level and adds even more utility to the network and the BOBA token. We’re not mandating BOBA over ETH – users can choose what suits them,” Chiu added.  In case users want to pay for transactions in BOBA but do not hold ether on Boba, they can select the “emergency swap” option that would allow for the purchase of ether with BOBA at market rates.

Sellers managed to implement our alternative scenario, which we talked about in the previous article. The alternative scenario was activated after the sellers broke the $70 mark. The poorly closed weekly candle of 18 April showed the complete apathy of buyers to accumulate positions in the range of $70. Thus, the trend line of buyers from September 2021 was broken and an aggressive fall wave began. The main target of sellers is the mark of $37. During the trading week of 10 May, sellers were unable to touch AVAX main liquidity zone. And it was from the $37 range that the first global correction of the cryptocurrency began in the spring of 2021. https://www.tradingview.com/x/jxadCjN9/ Given the mood in the cryptocurrency market and the sharp BTC price fall, the probability of a continued fall is quite high. So keeping your limited purchase orders in the $35-$37 range is a good idea in our opinion. However, investing in AVAX, it should be understood that the prospect of falling below $37 exists. Dividing the deposit to invest in AVAX should be divided into several parts. Below $37, the next limit purchase order should be in the $20 range. We doubt that sellers will be able to lower the AVAX price below $20 without a global medium-term correction and price rebound.

Casa builds what is known as a “self-custody” bitcoin (BTC) wallet that leaves users in control of their private keys. This differs from the custodial model employed by exchanges that take control of the crypto asset, and is favored by bitcoin diehards who live by the “be your own bank” mantra.  With the new round closed, Casa said it wants to make wallets more intertwined with their owner’s digital fingerprint. Its new “Casa API” will help businesses, such as Swan Bitcoin and Choice IRA, authenticate their customers’ financial identity when approving loans or making retirement investments, a press release said.  The round was led by Acrew Capital, with contributions from Positive Sum Ventures, Naval Ravikant and Scott Belsky, according to a press release. Last February, Casa raised $4 million in seed funding.  “Our investors will play a crucial role in driving the global self-sovereignty revolution in the years to come, ensuring we continue to drive the industry forward by delivering new solutions – like Casa API – that add to the richness, utility and, above all, security of Bitcoin,” said CEO Nick Neuman in a press release.

42395422,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASx0y4,1652181645,The FCA Is Holding Its First CryptoSprint: Here’s What the Digital Asset Community Wants From It,"The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is holding a two-day CryptoSprint, a forum for the financial regulator to discuss oversight of the industry with experts and participants.  Many in the crypto community are hoping the event, which runs Tuesday and Wednesday, will help the U.K. become more crypto friendly, in line with the announced policy of the Treasury, the government's finance arm. The FCA said last month it has been more critical of crypto in the past.  FCA sprints allow the financial regulator to focus on a specific topic. It invites experts from the relevant industry to answer questions on the ramifications of regulating a particular way, said Christopher Kiew-Smith, chief compliance officer at Zodia, a crypto custody provider. Kiew-Smith worked at the FCA from 2015 to 2017 as a senior associate, according to his LinkedIn profile.  “Our hope from the CryptoSprint is that this is the start of the process of accelerating the regulator up to the speed that the government – and the industry is trying to move at,” said Nick Jones, CEO of Zumo, a U.K.-based crypto wallet provider.  The FCA became the U.K.'s authority for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism in 2020, requiring crypto companies to register. A temporary registration regime (TRR) allowed them to continue operating while their applications were considered. So far, 34 companies have full registration and five companies remain on the TRR.  International crypto companies  Grayscale, a U.S.-based crypto asset management company, is considering doing business in the U.K., CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an interview. Grayscale shares a parent company, Digital Currency Group, with CoinDesk.  “You do need a new set of rules and regulations that can act as a tailwind to support job growth [plus] product and services development,” Sonnenshein said, talking about the U.K.  Kevin Yang, managing partner at Gate Ventures, crypto exchange Gate.io’s venture capital arm, told CoinDesk it was “paying attention to the progress of crypto regulations” in the U.K.  “We need to encourage innovation, right? On the other hand, we have to protect investors, so it's more like how can you balance these two sides,” Yang said.  New policies?  The crypto community is calling for a “collaborative joined-up approach and more government departments to write new fit-for-purpose regulation for the digital age,” Ian Taylor, the executive director of CryptoUK, a trade association for the industry, said in an interview.  The U.K. announced that it will be working on a new crypto regulatory package and has plans to regulate stablecoins. The U.K. already has a manual on how the HM Revenue and Customs, the government's tax arm, will tax crypto.  Read more: UK Crypto Industry Hopes for More Clarity From Planned Stablecoin Rules  Custody  A key question that will be tackled at the CryptoSprint will be: What gaps need to be addressed in the existing custody regulatory framework to protect consumers?  “It’s a critical topic, because the processes and procedures required are fundamentally different to those used to custody financial products or physical assets,” Sabrina Wilson, the chief operating officer at Copper, a custody solution provider on the TRR list, said in a statement.  Custody providers offer storage and security services for cryptocurrencies.  The FCA will also explore how clients' ownership rights of crypto assets are proven and protected.  Having something like the Financial Services Compensation Scheme to compensate clients of crypto firms that have gone out of business could give people more security, Zumo’s Jones said.  In an ideal case, “there's no financial crime, there's no money laundering, the company is likely to still exist in a year's time because the regulator is doing checks on whether there is enough cash in the business to keep going and there's enough cash to pay people back,” he said.  “The sector won’t be able to truly go mainstream without these protections,” Kene Ezeji-Okoye, co-founder of Millicent, a U.K.-based stablecoin provider, said in a statement, talking about consumer and anti-money laundering protections.  Information on crypto assets  Another question the FCA will consider is how information relating to the issuance of crypto assets should be disclosed to investors. Retail investors without access to financial advice are likely to need clearer messages regarding risks than institutional investors.  “The issuance stage is the most appropriate stage for information relating to the asset to be disclosed to users, as it will help to inform users whether to participate or not,” Ryan Shea, a crypto economist at France-based Trakx, a crypto index trading platform with a U.K. presence, said in a statement.  Updates should be provided when specific events that affect the token occur, Shea said.  Regulatory obligations  The FCA will also discuss where regulatory obligations on crypto asset models should be placed.  Regulators need to balance capturing relevant activity that poses a risk to consumers whilst also enabling innovation, the FCA said on its website.  Most of the responsibility will fall on centralized entities that can easily be identified, Jones said. But it needs to be balanced. Excessive oversight of the crypto sector could cause companies to move to other jurisdictions, Jones said.  The FCA will also have to find ways to regulate decentralized systems that do not have a central player.  “Regulating a decentralized crypto asset model is much more challenging than centralized asset models because they do not easily line up with geographic boundaries of national regulators,” Shea said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/10/the-fca-is-holding-its-first-cryptosprint-heres-what-the-digital-asset-community-wants-from-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6db8cd206ec3786ffaf00fd353af905e9c39f27-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395435,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASx1En,1652175316,"Chilean Digital Peso Would Need to Work Offline, Central Bank Governor Says","Chile's central bank digital currency (CBDC) would need to accept offline payments, the central bank governor said at an event on Tuesday. Governor Rosanna Costa promised a policy paper on the topic later this week, but added that no final decision had been taken on whether to issue a digital form of the Chilean peso.  A recent survey from the Bank of International Settlements, an organization that is owned by central banks, suggests that nine out of 10 central banks are considering issuing their own virtual assets, in part because of competition from the likes of bitcoin, but they are grappling with design issues to ensure access and privacy.  The CBDC should “should operate both online and offline,” Costa said at an event hosted by the BIS, adding that the technology to do so is “not necessarily efficient today.”  The system should “allow the authorities to trace the transaction afterwards,” while safeguarding personal data, Costa said.  The CBDC would have to coexist with and be convertible with cash and commercial banks, and be secure, she added, saying that pilot projects could be implemented after further discussions with public and private sectors due later this year.  In jurisdictions such as the European Union, officials are considering how to balance ability to make discreet cash-like transactions with the need to track illicit finance – and are considering offering more private means of payment for small purchases. Ghana has also considered making its CBDC available offline.  Read more: Europe's CBDC Designers Wrestle With Privacy Issues  Others think that the issue is a waste of time and that central banks should be focusing on areas where payments are now difficult.  “We are barking up the wrong tree with retail CBDCs,” Ravi Menon of the Monetary Authority of Singapore said at the event, arguing that existing payment networks are enough to deal with the needs of ordinary citizens.  “The tree we should be barking up is wholesale CBDCs for cross-border payments,” Menon added, implying that banks could make big international transactions without traditional tools like the SWIFT messaging service, which he called “laborious” and “archaic.”  International standard setters have been broadly supportive of moves to issue CBDCs, but worried that might mean central banks lose their power to tell citizens what to do with their money.  “In many countries with weak institutions, citizens might have incentives to move money out of the country,” said Tobias Adrian, director of the International Monetary Fund's monetary and capital markets department. “The vast majority of countries have some forms of capital controls, and there's both direct and anecdotal evidence that crypto assets are used for that.”  The IMF recently said countries should extend their laws to ensure measures such as restrictions on overseas payments include crypto assets.

Terra’s LUNA fell 50% as its UST stablecoin lost its peg with U.S. dollar, while meme coin dogecoin (DOGE) fared relatively better than the market with just a 6% drop.  Bitcoin temporarily fell under $30,000 during early Asian trading hours, buoyed by a weak broader market. Nasdaq ended Monday 4.29% lower, while Asian markets began Tuesday over 1% lower.  Such price action led to this year’s biggest liquidations losses so far. Data shows traders of bitcoin futures lost $346 million, ether futures lost $321 million, and LUNA futures lost $87 million – a higher-than-usual figure for traders of that asset.  More than $793 million of the total liquidations arose from long traders, or those betting on higher prices, which represented 74% of the futures trades. Some $257 million of that occurred on crypto exchange OKX, followed by Binance at $181 million and FTX at $102 million.  Open interest, or the amount of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled, fell 5.6%, implying traders closed their positions in anticipation of a further drop.

42435419,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxr2D,1652151486,UST Stablecoin Veers Wildly From Dollar Peg. Here's the Latest,"The Latest:  UST dropped as low as $0.65 on Monday, suggesting a potential collapse of the market’s leading algorithmic stablecoin.  LUNA, UST’s shock absorber, dropped 50% to $30.  Luna Foundation Guard, the entity in charge of maintaining the stablecoin’s peg, drained its $1.5 billion bitcoin reserve and bought $850 million more in BTC in a bid to defend UST’s peg.  The move may have created sell pressure contributing to bitcoin’s 10% price dip on Monday.  On Tuesday morning, UST returned to $0.90 following LFG's deployment of additional bitcoin to preserve the peg.  Algorithmic stablecoin UST lost its $1 peg for the second time in three days Monday, falling as low as $0.65 according to the most recent price estimates from CoinMarketCap. As UST has ""depegged,"" the price of LUNA, its sister token, has dropped 45% to $33 in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  The price action prompted the custodian of Terra’s bitcoin reserves, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), to snap up and quickly deploy 28,205 bitcoin (BTC) in a bid to defend the peg by buying up UST and providing liquidity on exchanges. That action coincided with a modest recovery in UST’s price; it surged from lows in the $0.65 range to $0.78 as of press time.  On Tuesday morning, UST returned to $0.90 as LFG's bitcoin reserves outweighed the exhausted supply on exchanges. Luna has also recovered from a low of $23.16 to $28.81.  As bitcoin sunk by 10% on Monday alone, UST’s believers and detractors alike pondered how much LFG’s salvation attempts exacerbated a bitcoin sell-off that brought BTC to its lowest price since July 2021.  As Terra supporters continued to signal confidence on Monday, a crowd of longtime critics were quick to say, “I told you so.” Some even drew parallels between Terra and IRON Finance, a stablecoin that fell to zero last year in what was called crypto’s first large-scale bank run.  “There's still ample reserves to support the peg,” Jose Maria Macedo, a member of LFG’s council, told CoinDesk earlier in the day as UST’s depegging was first becoming evident.  UST, a so-called algorithmic stablecoin, works with LUNA to maintain a price of $1 using game theory and a set of blockchain-based mint and burn mechanics. In an ideal world, these mechanics are supposed to ensure traders can always swap $1 worth of UST for $1 worth of LUNA, which has a floating price and is meant to serve as a kind of shock absorber for UST price volatility.  Centralized stablecoins like USDC and tether form the foundation of decentralized finance (DeFi) with their fully collateralized answers to the digital dollar, but Terra’s “decentralized” UST stablecoin has been nipping at their heels as of late with a market cap of over $18 billion.  Terra says its algorithmic stablecoin will rip power away from centralized institutions and failed monetary policies. Skeptics allege the entire system is a ponzi scheme propped up by memes, fake fundamentals and whales.  A UST collapse would send ripples through the entire DeFi industry, and it will sound alarm bells for regulators who notice retail investors holding the bag.  The shape of things to come  Trouble began brewing for Terra this past weekend, when major UST sell-offs from a Terra whale and precipitous withdrawals from UST’s Anchor money market briefly brought UST as low as $0.985 on Saturday.  Last Friday, 75% of circulating UST was deposited in Anchor, which has in the past wooed investors with 20% annual returns.  Anchor’s UST deposits nosedived from $14 billion to around $7 billion amid UST’s 72-hour price cratering.  Read more: Investors Flee Terra’s Anchor as UST Stablecoin Repeatedly Loses $1 Peg  UST’s heavy reliance on Anchor has long caused tension between the stablecoin’s boosters and critics who say that Anchor’s yields are artificially inflated by Terraform Labs (Terra’s creators) and its big-money backers, like Jump Crypto and Three Arrows Capital.  Over time, critics say, Anchor would’ve been forced to reduce yields to the point where users would no longer have any incentive to lock up UST with the platform. In a world where there are few other uses for UST, such a scenario would have spelled trouble for the fledgling currency.  To allay these and other concerns, Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon went on a massive bitcoin buying spree in order to create a kind of partial reserve for UST. The bitcoin reserves, which have no concrete link to the smart contracts that power Terra’s UST stablecoin, went into the hands of the newly formed LFG.  On Monday LFG announced that it would, for the first time, loan out the reserves to professional market makers in an attempt to defend UST’s peg.  The reserve funds, topped up by an additional $850 million on Monday, have been used to defend UST’s peg on exchanges like Binance and Curve.  While Macedo, the LFG council member, expressed optimism to CoinDesk that the BTC reserves would be enough to bring UST back to $1, not everyone agrees.  According to Kevin Galois, a hedge fund manager and Terra critic, “[Terra] barely bought themselves a day with their $750 million peg defense play.”  “At this point they either let LUNA bleed out max convertible amount per day or recapitalize the UST debt for cents on the dollar. So either haircut the UST holders or let the LUNA holders take massive losses,” Galois wrote to CoinDesk.  Perhaps the most consequential outcome of Monday’s price action is that Luna’s market cap has fallen below that of UST's. This potentially jeopardizes UST's entire stabilizing mechanism, which is built upon the idea that 1 UST can always be swapped for $1 of LUNA.  If UST is more valuable than LUNA, Terra risks becoming insolvent should there ever be a bank run.  What people are saying  Throughout Monday, Terra’s Korea-based founder, Do Kwon, remained uncharacteristically silent: “Deploying more capital – steady lads” was his only tweet.  Amid Kwon’s silence, retail boosters of Terra, so-called “LUNAtics,” appeared to be grappling with the possibility of a Terra collapse. One member of the 31,000+ Discord community bemoaned the price drops as a “massive hurdle” preventing observers from accepting “the whole entire concept of Terra + UST: decentralization.”  By 9:00 p.m. ET, Terra’s Discord moderators had set “slow mode” to one hour to keep the LUNAtics’ anxiety at bay.

Whether it&apos;s a targeted attack or a mass attack, phishing is always persistent. The reason behind this persistence is that it&apos;s a detrimental attack vector. Airdrop Phishing attacks are effective because they target users&apos; emotions rather than their intellect. Airdrop phishing is a unique type of phishing in how it&apos;s carried out. While it is not a new attack vector, more organizations have started using this attack vector on users in recent times. Now we will look at the causes, effects, and ways to protect yourself from airdrop phishing. What is Airdrop Phishing? Airdrop phishing is a type of phishing that uses social media as the medium to spread its fake links. Scammers post fake links on Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms. The links look real, but they will redirect you to a fake website that promises airdrops if you click on them. Airdrop phishing is a social engineering attack involving the deceptive use of social media to obtain sensitive information from unsuspecting users, including usernames and passwords. These phishing scams take advantage of people&apos;s trust in their friends and contacts to trick them with fake links appearing to be sent by a friend.

The founder, known as the Twitter user Zagabond, chronicled his NFT history in a blog post that detailed his involvement with the projects CryptoPhunks, Tendies and Cryptozunks, all of which were abandoned by their original founding team.  Zagabond credited much of Azuki’s success to learning from the other project’s failures.  “During these formative times, it’s important that the community encourages creators to innovate and experiment,” Zagabond said in the blog post. “Additionally, each experiment comes with key learnings.”  The announcement was met with backlash from the broader NFT community, with many believing the information was going to be made public in the coming days by way of on-chain sleuthing.  The post has reignited the conversation around NFT founder transparency, a debate which peaked in February after the real identities of the founders of the Bored Ape Yacht Club were revealed by BuzzFeed.  The price of an Azuki on the secondary marketplace OpenSea dropped from 19 ether (around $42,000) to as low as 10.9 ETH (around $24,000), but has since rebounded to 12 ETH (around $31,000) at the time of writing.

Monday's decline left bitcoin at a 10-month low and set its lowest price this year. The last time the largest cryptocurrency by market cap fell below the $30,000 threshold was on July 20, 2021, when it hit $29,301 before rebounding.

Meanwhile, futures on Nasdaq 100 Index rose 1.86% a day after valuations plummeted to the lowest in two years. S&P 500 futures were up 1.15%.  BTC down: What experts are saying  Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:  ""The recent crypto slide is strictly based on the tech share-led sell-off and not fundamentals for the cryptoverse. Bearish momentum could take bitcoin towards the $28,500 level, but that might start to be where some long-term bets come into play. The long-term fundamentals remain in place for bitcoin, but a return to record highs will take a long time. Bitcoin will start to stabilize when the bloodbath on Wall Street ends and right now many investors are still in panic-selling mode.""  Steven McClurg, Valkyrie chief investment officer and co-founder, told CoinDesk TV on Monday:  ""If the Fed continues to raise rates through June and July, we'll probably continue to get markets going down all the way through the summer. My expectation though is that due to midterm elections coming up in November, we'll probably see the Fed pausing or even lowering rates starting at the September meeting, so that will be the catalyst. We could see the market going back up at that point.""  Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, wrote in a report:  ""This is just a buyer strike of ultimate proportions, and it remains to be seen what (if anything) will bring buyers back.""
