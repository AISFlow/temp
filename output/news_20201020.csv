42405286,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLl2f,1603226537,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Tests $12K; Ethereum Fees Fall to 3-Month Low,"Bitcoin’s price passed $12,000 for the first time since September as Ethereum fees dipped.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,910 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.8% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,673-$12,058  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price continued to make gains Tuesday following Monday’s steady price appreciation. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency breached $12,000 around 17:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET), going as high as $12,058 before settling in at $11,910 as of press time.      The last time bitcoin was over $12,000 was back on Sept. 1, according to Bitstamp spot pricing. (CryptoCompare, using index-weighted pricing, puts it at Aug. 19.) David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at ExoAlpha, says bitcoin could hit $12,500 at some point soon but will face a struggle. “The real resistance level is around $12,500-ish, so until a meaningful breakout above that level, nothing is done, $12,000 is just a psychological level.”      Lifchitz said that while the price level is notable, it could lead to bitcoin staying in a sideways pattern around this level similar to when it crossed $10,000. “Bitcoin, having held above $10,000 for more than two months in a row, was a bullish sign, even if it had been trading sideways in a $2,000 range.”      Nevertheless, the last time bitcoin traded below $10,000 on the spot market was back on Sept. 9. This piece of data appears to be bolstering some investors’ faith.      “We continue to break the record each day for the longest streak a bitcoin trades above $10,000, so overall investor confidence is growing I think,” said Michael Gord, chief executive officer of trading firm Global Digital Assets.      Read More: Crypto-Friendly Signature Bank Raked In $4B in Deposits in Q3 2020      Bill Noble, cryptocurrency strategist for analysis firm Token Metrics, said momentum is shifting from Ethereum-based decentralized finance, or DeFi, to bitcoin. “ETH and DeFi are watching BTC awaken like a sleeping giant,” he said. “The BTC move to $12,000 is sending the altcoin universe scrambling for cover.”      Bitcoin dominance, a metric that calculates the cryptocurrency’s share versus other assets on the market, has been trending up since the start of October. The last time dominance was at this level was at the end of August.      “Although there is positive sentiment around BTC, bull runs usually lead to a bear market in alt coins,” noted Melvis Langyintuo, a market strategist for the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin.      Market conditions may mean DeFi discounts could develop for traders, Token Metrics’ Noble noted. “A BTC move above $12,000 could result in a DeFi dip that could be bigger than most expect,” he said. “Any such move could be a golden opportunity to pick up the survivors of the DeFi shakeout at discounted prices.”    Ethereum fees get cheap – for now    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Tuesday trading around $369 and slipping 2.6% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Validators Drop Off Ethereum 2.0 Testnets as Mainnet Release Looms      On Saturday, Oct. 17, the daily average fee on the Ethereum network hit a three-month low, at 0.00246199 ETH. That’s a level not seen since July 12 when the average was 0.00211437 ETH. Fees, which are trending back up from Sunday’s low, are required on Ethereum to send transactions, including to smart-contract based DeFi platforms.      Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of Tellurian Capital, an investment firm that has followed cryptocurrencies since 2014, said deflation of DeFi hype is causing fees to go down. “Gas fees are lower as the recent enthusiasm for DeFi tokens, [decentralized exchanges] and [automated market makers] has hit a wall for now,” Bonnefous told CoinDesk.      If DeFi heats up again, expect higher fees, Bonnefous added. “We could be in for a few weeks of consolidation before another push higher for DeFi tokens, which will most likely see gas costs flaring again. The problem of high gas fees won't go away without structural enhancements.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed, mostly red on Tuesday.

Why this matters to the crypto world:  1. Because the price of bitcoin and equities have been strongly correlated in recent months. Because the stimulus package would be a boost for stock markets, it could also provide a lift to the price of cryptocurrencies.  2. Crypto investors have been betting all year that the flood of government and central bank spending to fight the pandemic-caused economic slowdown will eventually lead to inflation, which would also be beneficial for cryptocurrencies.  3. All the stimulus is calling into question the independence of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which in the interest of preventing economic ruin in the short term has been basically printing money with abandon, leaving itself open to criticism about the mountain of debt these spending sprees is creating.  Meanwhile, Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a Bloomberg Television interview that progress was being made on ""key provisions"" and legislative language is being drafted.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate will take up the stimulus package if Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reach an agreement and the resulting measure passes the House, Bloomberg reported.  McConnell didn't say whether he'd back the measure. Several GOP senators are backing a much smaller package.

42405276,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLkrq,1603220271,"With COMP Below $100, a Look Back at the 'DeFi Summer' It Sparked","The curtain has fallen on DeFi Summer – not that the sector is done, but the wild buzz seems to be.      The changing of the seasons is marked by Compound's governance token, COMP, falling below $100 early Tuesday. COMP kicked off the yield farming craze way back in June as a new mechanism for luring assets onto what is now the sixth-largest decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, and the first to briefly topple MakerDAO as the industry leader.      COMP has been hovering right around $100 since a big drop on Oct. 6 brought it down close to our arbitrary threshold, and it's finally lost that sweet third order of magnitude.      Compound Labs founder Robert Leshner declined to comment for this story.    How DeFi got here    After Compound's June surge, things started to get interesting as DeFi's money legos began stacking up.      First introduced on Ethereum by Synthetix in July 2019, ""liquidity mining"" is what inspired this summer's boom. The prospect of giving people a fresh new token above and beyond normal returns on deposits quickly drove COMP up higher than anyone had seemed to anticipate. On June 21, COMP reached its zenith at $372.      Read more: First Mover: Compound's COMP Token More Than Doubles in Price Amid DeFi Mania      The governance token's runaway success led other dapps to follow suit, such as with the multi-token pool maker Balancer, the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Rarible and others.      But events would quickly become comical in ways they only can in crypto.      First, a prominent automated market maker (AMM) would have its governance token accidentally released early, then vegetable coins would take over everyone's imagination and the final drama would introduce vampirism and a convoluted exit scam.      Ultimately, leading AMM Uniswap would release its governance token, UNI, with its own liquidity mining scheme.      ""I personally consider UNI issuance is the peak of this farming movement,"" Primitive Ventures' Dovey Wan told CoinDesk in an email.    Endless summer    The takeaway from DeFi Summer for Wan is the power of the fair launch narrative that was kicked off by Yearn.Finance. Yearn had already been a tool to optimize returns when COMP was first released, but the excitement engendered by yield farming sparked a lot of innovation.      Yearn's creator, Andre Cronje, created the YFI governance token and urged liquidity providers to earn it rather than buy it. Setting aside no pre-mine for himself, this sent already hyped-up yield farmers into overdrive.      Read more: What Is Yearn Finance? The DeFi Gateway Everyone Is Talking About      ""The biggest value of this hype is bringing the fair launch back to the game,"" Wan wrote. ""The fundraising or bootstrapping liquidity mechanism itself, through farming, quickly gains mindshare and adoption. This will definitely bring value to the industry as an alternative to the previous VC presale game.""      Other observers are taking a similarly long view on the sector's staying power.      ""It's obvious to anyone who studies this space that DeFi has major structural advantages compared to CeFi,"" Spencer Noon, an investor at DLT Capital, told CoinDesk in an email, referring to traditional, or centralized, finance. ""This is because, among other factors, protocols don't have employees, physical locations, or incur other expenses that traditional finance companies do.""      In a provocative twist, the final rays of DeFi Summer coincided with U.S. enforcement actions against crypto exchange BitMEX that cast a new light on the benefits of decentralization.      ""If we look at the big picture, the recent indictment from [the Department of Justice] on BitMEX is another alert why we need a true decentralized finance alternative where it can have minimal exposure to potential regulatory haul,"" Wan wrote, who added that bubbles are moments for innovation and adoption.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Even as DeFi Summer cooled, the coin that kicked it all off held onto value as the narrative it had launched moved on. It wasn't until Sept. 4 that COMP would sink below $200.      But Kain Warwick, of Synthetix, the firm that birthed liquidity mining into the crypto lexicon, is undeterred by the cooling of 2020's DeFi buzz.      He believes that underneath it all, an actual industry has been proven out.      ""[Decentralized exchange] volumes and usage as well as [total value locked] are still 10x+ up from earlier in the year. So while the irrational exuberance has been tempered we are still directionally in a good place in terms of traction,"" Warwick said, adding:    ""At some point we need to transition from hype to reality. The big difference between this cycle and the previous one is that the reality is here and it is sustainable.""",NEUTRAL,COMP | UNI | YFI,COMP | MINING | UNI | YFI | ZRX,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/20/with-comp-below-100-a-look-back-at-the-defi-summer-it-sparked,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fe53d2331ace50d97795d2b6046639067c45abd-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Kik and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have proposed settling their dispute over a 2017 token sale with a $5 million fine.      The proposed judgement for injunctive and monetary relief, which also enjoins the Canadian firm against future U.S. securities law violations, still needs approval from presiding federal District Court Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein, according to public court documents. If approved, the settlement would cap off a yearlong legal fight between the two.      Kik must give the SEC 45 days' notice on any transactions related to its Kin token treasury under the proposal. That notice order expires three years after the judgment takes effect. CEO Ted Livingston declined to comment.      A similar lawsuit filed by the securities regulator against messaging platform Telegram saw that firm's blockchain project, the Telegram Open Network, abandoned before it could launch.      But Kik's proposed deal has a critical difference from Telegram's ill-fated TON outcome: it would not destroy the defendant's tokenized dreams. Mandating that Kik notify the SEC of any kin sales within the next three years is the settlement's only effect.      The judgement would tie up a legal bout that only 20 days ago appeared to be heading toward a resounding loss for Kik.      Kik originally announced it hoped to fight the SEC in court, potentially creating a precedent for how token sales might be treated under U.S. securities law. However, it backed away from a jury trial request in March, and lost a motion for summary judgement last month.      At the time, a judge ruled that Kik's issuance of Kin was an investment of funds in a joint enterprise that sought to boost the token's price, satisfying the prongs of the Howey Test, a U.S. Supreme Court case used as a precedent for evaluating whether assets are securities.

In a live interview Tuesday with Hedgeye CEO Keith McCullough, Saylor said bitcoin volume is being reported at a wildly inflated $24.76 billion, referencing the current volume on Apple’s Stocks application. That number is similar to 24-hour bitcoin volume of $20.3 billion reported by CoinGecko.      This data ""ships to a billion devices in the world,” Saylor noted, referring to Apple. “It’s garbage.”      ""I know for a fact you can’t buy more than $35 million a day without people knowing, so there’s no freaking way there’s $24 billion trading,” Saylor explained, adding that he thinks bad data is ""holding back bitcoin."" “It’s just awful.”      Estimates of what volume is ""real"" are ""still all over the map,"" said Galen Moore, senior analyst at CoinDesk Research.

Non-profits have rejected bitcoin donations made from hackers. And a FinCEN investigation raises questions about bitcoin mixers and the Bank Secrecy Act. Here's all the news people are talking about in crypto today.    Top shelf    Corporate DeFi? R3’s open-source variation of its enterprise blockchain, Corda Network, will see the addition of a native cryptocurrency. The new coin, called XDC, will open the gates to build central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and decentralized finance applications (DeFi) on the network. Programmed by the Cordite Society, a group of former bankers building decentralized tools, the XDC system will have compliance baked in to meet anti-money laundering (AML) standards, as every node represents a legal entity, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports. The Cordite Network is welcoming new members to vote on the rate of supply of XDC and other points of governance going forward.      Ironic outcome Uniswap’s first voting process demonstrated the need to overhaul its governance system, Dharma CEO Nadav Hollander has said, following a ""disappointing outcome."" The vote was over reducing the token threshold required to make and pass proposals on the protocol. Despite 98% of the votes cast being in favor of a proposed change, the total number needed for a successful vote fell short of the 40 million required by about 400,000. A successful vote would have seen this requirement drop by around a third. Hollander also said the vote ""galvanized users to delegate in much higher numbers,"" which was a ""healthy outcome for Uniswap.""      Dirty money Robinhood-esque hackers who stole from corporations to give to charities have seen their donations rebuked. Members of the hacking group Darkside attempted to give bitcoin donations to two non-profits, Children International and The Water Project. The group used ransomware to steal from profitable companies with the intention of giving “some of the money” to charity, according to a BBC report citing a darknet blog. To make the donations, the cybercriminals used the service offered by The Giving Block, a U.S.-based project that converts donations into dollars for charities not set up to handle cryptocurrencies. ""If the donation is linked to a hacker, we have no intention of keeping it,"" Children International said.      CBDC platform LINE Corporation, operator of the popular messaging app, is jumping into the CBDC game with a platform to allow central banks to develop digital currencies. The platform reportedly will help central banks develop customized, blockchain-based CBDCs by offering tools to issue digital tokens, tokenize assets and run decentralized applications (known as dapps). LINE is not alone. Mastercard recently released a platform allowing central banks to test how proposed digital currencies would work in real life. A LINE representative told South Korean newspaper Chosun that ""major"" Asian nations are already in discussions with the firm, though they could not disclose which ones.      Deposit growth Deposits at crypto-friendly Signature Bank grew by $4.11 billion, an 8% increase, in the third quarter of 2020. Over the past year, deposits have grown by $15.28 billion, or nearly a 40% increase, according to the bank's earnings release. Signature reports $54.34 billion in total deposits. ""Crypto firms are often a rich source of low-cost deposits for the few banks that openly serve the sector. As such, analysts have paid close attention to deposit growth at Signature, Silvergate Bank and Metropolitan Commercial Bank,"" CoinDesk's Nathan DiCamillo reports.

Bitcoin mixers are services designed to anonymize the source of funds. The U.S. financial watchdog hailed these civil charges as the ""first"" action against a bitcoin mixer.      It was also said to be the first time the U.S. Department of Justice explicitly called bitcoin mixing a ""crime,"" casting a shadow on any service that obscures bitcoin's publicly accessible path, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported.      Prosecutors allege Harmon ran the unregistered money services business Helix from 2014 to 2017, conducting 1,225,000 transactions for customers and is ""associated with virtual currency wallet addresses that have sent or received over $311 million."" From 2017 on, prosecutors say Harmon provided money transmission services via Coin Ninja.      Each of these transactions are said to be in violation of the Banking Secrecy Act. Prosecutors also said Harmon had a responsibility to file suspicious activity reports and systemically flouted U.S. money laundering laws.      “If you're in the crypto space you're about to become as familiar with the BSA as you think you are with the 33 and 34 acts and the Howey test,” Stephen Palley, a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Anderson Kill, tweeted. “Each one of these violations is a separate violation of the BSA. That is why the penalty is so massive.”      “The max penalty is $209,144,554. That's a gobsmackingly enormous number because BSA non-compliance is heavily penalized and because FinCEN really really wants you to comply and really really wants you to be in pain if you don't comply,” Drew Hinkes, an attorney with Carlton Fields, tweeted.

42405283,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLkyj,1603209104,The US Risks Getting Left Behind on CBDCs,"This week, as world leaders gather virtually for DC Fintech Week in Washington, D.C., a key focus will be on central banks issuing their own digital currencies (CBDC). A pivotal player here is the United States, which faces an increasingly urgent decision: whether to take serious steps towards issuing a CBDC, as the Bank of China and others have begun. The sooner it decides, the better.      Many countries are addressing this issue seriously and quickly, as surveyed by tracking projects at the Atlantic Council and elsewhere. Pilot programs are ongoing in multiple nations, most notably China, which recently ran a trial with 50,000 residents of Shenzhen – reigniting concerns about its rapid progress and geostrategic implications. By contrast, the U.S. remains comparatively cautious and quiet.    The authors are attorneys and advise digital currency projects at the law firm of Schnapper-Casteras PLLC. JP Schnapper-Casteras is also a Non-Resident Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council, focusing on CBDCs and financial technology regulation.    On CBDCs, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said this week that it is more important for the U.S. to “get it right than to be first.” The most concrete CBDC exploration is at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which is collaborating with MIT to survey 30-40 available technologies over two to three years. Treasury Department officials hint more work is happening behind the scenes, but little has been made public.      If the U.S. wants to lead on CBDCs, there is much more it could reasonably do, and soon – even short of being “first.” It could test out several pilot projects at the same time, as underscored by the Digital Dollar Project (a group led by Chris Giancarlo, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission) and along the lines of what the Bank of France and People's Bank of China are already undertaking.      U.S. stakeholders, including Congress, should start wrestling with the crucial and complicated issues of the digital dollar’s design, including the paramount issue of privacy. Giancarlo stressed that may turn out to be “ace to play in the contest for the future of digital money” and could help contrast the “digital dollar” against other nations’ CBDCs that reflect different values and priorities.      If, on the other hand, the U.S. wants to continue waiting while other countries move forward on CBDCs, it could lean into a substantial role for the private sector. The prospect of private sector “digital dollars” scared some policymakers when Facebook announced its libra cryptocurrency last June, but recently Powell and his colleagues have started looking favorably at different forms of private-sector collaboration. In the absence of a clear national policy, the private issuance of “digital dollars” is already happening, evidenced by the surge in privately issued “crypto-dollars,” a phenomenon profiled by Coin Metrics cofounder Nic Carter.    What could be even worse is waiting, and getting left behind.    Moreover, the Treasury’s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently gave banks the okay to hold bank reserves on behalf of certain “digital dollar” issuers. If the U.S. engages the private sector, we believe it should embrace and demand the model that worked for the early internet: open-source and interoperable technology standards.      At one level, the Federal Reserve’s current “wait and see” approach is understandable: It is a historically conservative institution and, as the issuer of the world’s reserve currency, has much to lose if its CBDC efforts flounder. Cybersecurity flaws might scotch a digital dollar launch, for example.      Still, there is surely a greater cost to all this waiting.      As CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert candidly admitted on Monday at DC FinTech Week, “The only thing that scares me is the U.S. falling behind [on CBDCs].”      See also: Chris Giancarlo - Don’t Rush Digital Dollar During COVID-19 Crisis      Other countries that move earlier on CBDCs may stand to gain from that first-mover advantage: reaching or surpassing the United States on infrastructure, establishing industry standards or expanding their spheres of influence via digital currency adoption.      Domestically, moving too slowly and maintaining the status quo could deprive the U.S. of new and important fiscal and monetary tools, including the ability to rapidly and precisely disseminate stimulus funds directly to citizens during a recurring pandemic or lingering depression.      In the worst case, the U.S. would muddle along the next few years with the worst of both worlds: neither material progress on national financial infrastructure nor enhanced regulatory clarity or open standards for private providers.      The United States faces a pressing decision about whether to join other countries and start working, openly and urgently, on a digital currency that would complement paper cash. As tough as the decision may be, what could be even worse is waiting and getting left behind.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"JP Schnapper-Casteras, Misha Guttentag",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/20/the-us-risks-getting-left-behind-on-cbdcs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/237ac65eddc96696d2c6787bfa7380247cfa4657-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405282,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLkzi,1603205467,"CBDCs Mean Evolution, Not Revolution","Who wants a central bank digital currency (CBDC)?      Plenty of people, apparently; industry groups are advocating digital cash, millions of people have reportedly signed up to a lottery to receive digital renminbi in Shenzhen as part of the Chinese central bank’s pilot project, and the Libra Association wants to “integrate” CBDCs. Technology firms, banks, NGOs and consultancies are now jostling to ride the next wave of innovation.    Benoît Cœuré is head of the Innovation Hub at the Bank for International Settlements and a member of the bank's Executive Committee. Previously, he was a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank. From 2013 to 2019, he chaired the BIS' Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures.    Earlier this year, 80% of the world’s central banks had already started to conceptualize and research the potential for CBDCs, 40% were building proofs-of-concept and 10% were deploying pilot projects, according to BIS research.      Central bankers believe digital cash could be a useful addition to their toolbox, combining the safety of central bank money with electronic convenience. Safe electronic money is hardly revolutionary. For most people in advanced economies, good banking services with deposit insurance are freely available. Nonetheless, concerns have been raised that a super-safe, super-convenient new kind of money could crowd out bank deposits and starve an economy of credit in normal times, while nascent insecurities could snowball into faster-than-ever bank runs thanks to how easy it could be to move savings into digital cash.      For a start, a CBDC would ensure that, as our economies go digital, the general public would retain access to the safest form of money – held as a claim on a central bank which can never go bust. And, this will be in a form they could use freely in their daily lives.      A CBDC would be a kind of digital banknote and, as such, could satisfy more use cases than paper while the issuer, being a central bank, could support liquidity, settlement finality and trust in the value of the currency. As a result, it could promote payment diversity, help make cross-border payments faster and cheaper, foster financial inclusion and even facilitate fiscal transfers in times of crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.    They are not a revolution or an end in themselves. Yet, they might be a way of achieving a more inclusive, accessible, safe and convenient form of money.    Balancing these opportunities and risks is a significant practical and technical challenge. A recent report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the central banks of Canada, the euro area, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States sets out the principles and offers a guide to navigating these uncharted waters.      It also puts forward the equivalent of a monetary Hippocratic oath – pledging that any potential CBDC should “do no harm” to central banks’ monetary and financial stability mandates. In fact, it goes one step further, stating that a CBDC should complement – not replace – cash and safe, private money in a new monetary ecosystem that nurtures innovation and private competition. CBDCs are more than just another way to pay. They could be the evolutionary foundation for new, publicly accessible platforms to encourage diverse ecosystems of banks and fintechs, avoiding the “winner takes all” networks we have seen emerging in our daily digital lives, and making sure innovation benefits the many, not just a few.      The exact design will vary by jurisdiction, as well as the extent to which a CBDC will seek to be a neutral means of payment or a new way to do monetary policy. Answers will vary by central bank, as will many other design choices, and will likely involve extensive consultations with the private sector and the public at large.      See also: Ajit Tripathi - 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital Currencies      But if a CBDC is a matter of national taste, why (and how) should central banks work together across borders? That is where the Bank for International Settlements and its Innovation Hub come in. The BIS is owned by, and run for, more than 60 central banks around the world. We started out in 1930 but we focus on the future.      We are serious about exploring CBDCs because central banks realize that this provides an essential opportunity to pool knowledge and resources as well as build systems that complement each other and help make many cross-border payments faster, more transparent and cheaper.      The Innovation Hub is building technological capacity with its hosts to help central banks design workable solutions to emerging challenges. By the end of this year, we plan to publish our first wholesale CBDC proof-of-concept with the Swiss National Bank.      This will pave the way for experiments on the building blocks of a retail CBDC, which might include interlinkages with existing payment systems, application programming interfaces for distribution, digital identity rails, compliance monitoring, cyber and counterfeiting resilience and offline functionality. To help this, we will grow our own blockchain capacity.      This work is directed towards practical solutions rather than the conceptual research of recent years. CBDCs will not usher in an age of prosperity or solve a raft of societal issues – this is beyond the scope of any currency. They are not a revolution or an end in themselves. Yet, they might be a way of achieving a more inclusive, accessible, safe and convenient form of money. They might support a more diverse payment ecosystem, nationally and internationally and, if developed astutely, provide a new form of global public good.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Benoit Coeure,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/20/cbdcs-mean-evolution-not-revolution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cba751e3b42cab38754f949e0bd8fa840e06d0b9-1417x1209.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405267,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLkkx,1603201909,"Signature Bank Gains $1B Deposits in Q3, With Notable Growth From Stablecoin Issuers","The Takeaway:    Deposits at crypto-friendly Signature Bank grew by $4.11 billion in the third quarter, an 8% increase from the previous quarter.  Over the past year, deposits have grown by $15.28 billion or nearly a 40% increase, according to the bank's earnings release. Signature reports $54.34 billion in total deposits.  Crypto firms are often a rich source of low-cost deposits for the few banks that openly serve the sector. As such, analysts have paid close attention to deposit growth at Signature, Silvergate Bank and Metropolitan Commercial Bank.    The $1 billion in deposit growth from digital asset banking at crypto-friendly Signature Bank was driven in part by the bank holding the dollars backing stablecoins, CEO Joseph DePaolo said on a third-quarter earnings call Tuesday.      Prominent stablecoins like USDC, PAX and TUSD are backed by actual dollars held in bank accounts. While it's unclear which stablecoin issuers Signature is serving, the statement by DePaolo is the first time the bank has said it's banking such firms.      For years, Signature has been one of the handful of banks to offer accounts where crypto firms could securely hold fiat. The New York-based bank competes with California's Silvergate Bank and other institutions for low-cost crypto deposits by offering an Ethereum-based payments platform called Signet, which rivals the Silvergate Exchange Network as a fiat on-ramp. The bank also extended around 40 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to firms in the crypto space this year.      Signature’s disclosure Tuesday comes after the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency published new guidance in September clarifying that national banks could hold fiat for stablecoin issuers.      Read more: SEC, OCC Issue First Regulatory Clarifications for Stablecoins    By the numbers    The banking team at Signature that focuses on crypto companies added the same amount of new deposits it produced in the second quarter. DePaolo attributed the back-to-back billion-dollar quarters to clients becoming used to Signature's presence in the space.      ""The clients we're bringing on board were hesitant at first,"" he said. ""They wanted to see that we were going to stay in the business.""      The $1 billion added in Q3 made up a quarter of the bank's $4.11 billion new deposits, an 8% increase.      Around 30% of Signature's $54.34 billion in total deposits, or $16.2 billion, are non-interest-bearing, which usually accounts for crypto-industry deposits. Signature's cost of deposits increased slightly to 66 basis points from 56 basis points in the second quarter.

Only 36% of the necessary 66% participants needed to secure the Medalla testnet have stuck around, according to beaconcha.in.      That’s echoed by the more recent Zinken testnet, which has just under the 66% needed to function properly as of Monday, according to beaconcha.in. Those testnets – meant to practice the launch of Eth 2.0’s Phase 0 this fall – launched in September and October, respectively.      “Medalla has entered a finality issue again due to user confusion around which testnet they should run.

The low testnet participation rates are mirrored by rhetoric from Eth 2.0 developers who say they are ready for Eth 2.0’s Phase 0 to begin.

42405262,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLj8b,1603198838,First Mover: Monero Leads Privacy-Coin Rally as Bitcoin Trips on Path to $12K,"Bitcoin (BTC) was gaining for a fourth straight day, approaching the $12,000 price threshold the cryptocurrency failed to hold in August when it last rallied past that level.      “The market has started to move again,” the Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm Arcane Research wrote Tuesday in a report.      In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open as investors bet U.S. lawmakers could reach agreement on a new stimulus bill.    Market moves    Privacy coins like monero (XMR) and zcash (ZEC ) are suddenly in vogue – despite regulators' efforts to crack down on them.      These digital tokens, which come with features allowing users to obfuscate their identities and hide the amounts transferred, have surged in value this year. Monero’s price has nearly tripled in 2020, and zcash has doubled. According to the data firm Messari, a group of 21 digital assets with anonymity-enhancing features has gained 142% this year, compared with bitcoin's 60% gain.      The bullish market tone comes even as U.S. Internal Revenue Service recently hired blockchain analytics firms Chainalysis and Integra FEC to develop transaction tracing tools for monero and other protocols used to obscure identities. And the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this month published an extensive report on its enforcement framework for digital assets, citing the use of anonymity-enhancing cryptocurrencies as a risk to anti-money-laundering programs and efforts to combat terrorism finance.      Some cryptocurrency analysts say the jump in prices for privacy tokens might just be coincidental, a function of speculation on the part of traders keying off price-chart patterns or algorithms. But it might be that traders think privacy tokens will occupy a key spot in fast-developing, international digital-asset markets and payment systems – precisely because so many users don't want to transact business under the glare of monitoring by governments, banks or exchanges.      ""Cryptographers and researchers are always going to be one step ahead on privacy,” Riccardo ""Fluffypony"" Spagni, one of the Monero network's maintainers, told CoinDesk in an interview.      In other words, the regulatory inquiries could turn out to be net positives for monero.      “It gets visibility in the market,” David Jevans, CEO of blockchain forensics firm CipherTrace, told CoinDesk in a telephone interview. ""People should be able to pay for day-to-day expenses without having to fear hitting regulators’ radar and provide identity proofs.”      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Cryptographers Are Always Going to Be ‘One Step Ahead’ of Regulators: Monero’s Spagni    Bitcoin watch    The path of least resistance for bitcoin is to the higher side.      The cryptocurrency jumped more than 2% Monday, confirming a descending triangle breakout. The pattern indicates the rally from the Oct. 8 lows near $10.,500 has resumed.      Open interest in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is considered synonymous with institutional interest, jumped over 20% to a seven-week high of $624 million Monday, validating the bullish breakout on technical charts.      Further, macro factors look to be aligned in favor of the bulls. The likes of the European Central Bank and the Reserve Bank of Australia are expected to ramp up monetary stimulus over the next two months – a long-term positive development for the perceived store of value assets like bitcoin and gold. Traditional markets are pricing additional inflation-boosting U.S. fiscal stimulus.      But a number of big sell orders appear positioned around $12,000, which could make it harder for bulls to engineer a quick move past that mark.      As such, the focus has shifted to resistance located at $12,476 (August high). On the downside, the Oct. 16 low of $11,200 is the level to target for the bears.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin Closes on $12K But a Wall of Sell Orders Awaits: Analyst    Token watch    Filecoin (FIL): Decentralized file-storage protocol releases token rewards in advance after crypto miners rebel against ""unfair"" economic model.

42405256,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLj2h,1603198812,Binance-Backed Privacy Mavens Release Tokenomic Lynchpin: 'Proof-of-Relay',"Decentralized privacy protocol HOPR is releasing “proof-of-relay” (PoR), the lynchpin of its incentive mechanism that ensures payments go to users that help shuffle data traffic among other nodes on the network.      HOPR had already invited participants to test the network, resulting in 500 or so nodes joining. Wednesday’s launch of the HOPR Basòdino testnet is the first time the complete protocol plus PoR will be made available, said the startup’s CEO, Sebastian Bürgel.      “To draw some analogies, most people have heard of proof-of-work [PoW] or proof-of-stake [PoS], which are mechanisms to protect blockchains and guarantee integrity,” Bürgel said in an interview. “In a similar fashion, when relay nodes in HOPR are doing work, which is relaying packets, they’re providing a proof to the network, and for providing the proof they get rewarded in HOPR tokens.”      All rewards gathered on the testnet will be made available when HOPR tokens launch on the live mainnet towards the end of this year, Bürgel explained. Users can now open and fund payment channels with xHOPR tokens and send messages that hop via one or more nodes before reaching their destination. If you act as a relay node, you’ll earn tickets, which can be redeemed for xHOPR, he said.      Read more: Binance Labs Leads $1M Seed Round in Crypto Tor Alternative HOPR      HOPR obscures internet communication from prying eyes by incentivizing a network of nodes to mix data packets with other traffic before sending them on. This makes it near-impossible for third parties like telcos or internet service providers (ISPs) to trace bits of metadata and work out who’s communicating with who.      As such, HOPR offers a blockchain-based internet protocol in the same vein as Tor (the onion router) or a virtual private network (VPN). In terms of crypto-focused efforts already out there, privacy startup Nym has a bitcoin incentive program for users to run its mixnet, and the Orchid protocol also offers a system based around Ethereum-compatible ERC-20 tokens as an incentive.      Read more: Privacy Startup Nym Will Pay You in Bitcoin to Run Its Mixnet      The recent explosion of interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) has brought congestion to the Ethereum blockchain and with it skyrocketing transaction costs. HOPR gets around this by using a layer 2 scaling system on Ethereum called Matic chain. The latter removes punishing gas fees and enables high transaction throughput.      “Matic is the blockchain that we run our payment scheme on, because if we have 500 people that do a bunch of transactions and we had to pay them between a few dollars to $10 per transaction, that would be prohibitively expensive,” said Bürgel. “Matic allows you to settle for a fraction of a cent in seconds, as opposed to minutes on the Ethereum blockchain.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/20/binance-backed-privacy-mavens-release-tokenomic-lynchpin-proof-of-relay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57ac1d931416c4869fd5358d9d2237cab67896a4-1400x1050.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405259,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLj4f,1603198800,"Zcoin Employs Burn-and-Redeem Privacy Model, Offering Alternative to Coinjoins","The project behind privacy coin zcoin is launching the privacy protocol Lelantus on its testnet today. Lelantus allows confidential and anonymous blockchain transactions with short verification times. Using a burn-and-redeem model, users are able to destroy coins of arbitrary amounts and to redeem new coins, such that there is no previous transaction history associated with them.      The burn-and-redeem model is an alternative to other privacy methods such as coinjoins or using other people's transactions as decoys for possible sources and destinations. Instead, it allows you to destroy your coins and add them to a general pool of all the other coins that other users have destroyed.      “At any time in the future, you can submit a cryptographic proof that proves you destroyed/burnt coins without revealing which coin it was,” said Zcoin Project Steward Reuben Yap in an email. “This proof, once accepted, will allow you to redeem coins that do not have any previous transaction history or linkages.”    Zcoin’s new Lelantus functions    Lelantus uses a one-out-of-many proofs cryptographic concept, which proves that you are one of the many people who burned the coins, without showing which coins you actually burned. It also lets users redeem partial amounts of coin when they want. Previously, users had to redeem the total amount of coin they burned when redeeming.      Yap likens the Lelantus burn-and-redeem model to buying a ticket for a carnival ride. When you go to the turnstile, you just have to show a ticket.      Read more: Cryptographers Are Always Going to Be ‘One Step Ahead’ of Regulators: Monero’s Spagni      “The ticket acts like a receipt of payment, but it doesn’t have to show that I was the person who paid for it or the exact bank notes that were used to purchase it,” said Yap. “The same principle is applied to the burn-and-redeem model for zcoins. As long as my receipt checks out, I can redeem it for new coins.”      With the Lelantus protocol, and partial redemption, what this means is a 24-hour ticket could be used for a few hours one day, none the next and then the remainder the following day.      “With previous burn-and-redeem systems such as Zerocoin and Sigma, if I burnt a 100 dollar note I had to redeem a 100 dollar note” said Yap. “Lelantus' main innovation is that I can burn a 100 dollar note and redeem any amount that is smaller without revealing that it even came from the 100 dollar note.”    No trusted setup required for privacy focus    Lelatnus also requires no trusted setup. In cryptographic terms, a trusted setup creates a cryptographic system by generating certain initial parameters which will later be destroyed. It’s called a trusted setup because you must trust the person creating it to destroy said parameters.      Read more: Privacy Startup Nym Will Pay You in Bitcoin to Run Its Mixnet      Using a trusted setup offers a point of failure and goes against the blockchain motto of “Don’t trust. Verify.”      “A compromised trusted setup in zero-knowledge proofs allows someone to forge the proofs, meaning that coins can be created out of thin air leading to hyperinflation,” said Yap. “In privacy coins where amounts are obscured, such inflation can also remain undetected.”    Lelantus 2.0 to come?    The mainnet launch of Lelantus is currently scheduled in four to six weeks, depending on testnet feedback.      “We’re already working on Lelantus 2.0 or Aura, which allows you to pass the right to redeem to someone else, and the amounts are hidden,” Yap added. “You do not have to redeem the coins yourself, instead you can transfer that right which offers the very highest level of privacy.”      Zcoin was launched in 2016 and is based on the Zerocoin protocol, which used zero-knowledge proofs to protect user transactions. It is not to be confused with Zcash, which is based on the Zerocash paper. While the Zerocoin paper and Zerocash paper have some overlap in authors and use zero-knowledge proofs, they rely on different cryptography, according to Zcoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | XMR | ZEC,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/20/zcoin-employs-burn-and-redeem-privacy-model-offering-alternative-to-coinjoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9eb93f93c46e0bd7c96e0c07ec7fd8047345f0b2-2560x1714.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto analyst Lark Davis believes bitcoin is now positioned for a notable rally.  However, a number of big sell orders positioned around $12,000 may make it harder for the bulls to engineer a quick move above $12,000.  ""The supply wall is still looming at around $12,000. We are seeing roughly 1,000 BTC sitting on offer [sell orders] on Coinbase up to $12,000 (Bitfinex, Binance, and Coinbase together have roughly $4,000 BTC on offer up to $12,000),"" Heusser noted.  That said, the underlying sentiment looks quite bullish if bitcoin can push past these offers.  The cryptocurrency has seen a steady price increase from $10,000 to $11,800 over the past five weeks despite negative news like the BitMEX charges, KuCoin's hack, the OKEx key drama, President Donald Trump's health scare and a stock market sell-off.  Further, the likes of the European Central Bank and the Reserve Bank of Australia are expected to ramp up monetary stimulus over the next two months – a long-term positive development for the perceived store of value assets like bitcoin and gold.  Traditional markets are also pricing in additional inflation-boosting U.S. fiscal stimulus.  Open interest in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, considered synonymous with institutional interest, jumped by over 20% to a seven-week high of $624 million on Monday, according to data source Skew.  A rise in open interest along with a rise in price is often said to confirm an uptrend.  Open interest rose sharply from $364 million to $948 million in the four weeks to Aug. 17. During that period, bitcoin rose from $9,100 to levels above $12,400.  A break above the immediate resistance at $12,000 would shift the focus to the August high of $12,476.  ""If we move below $11,200, I will start worrying about my long position and will reduce it,"" Heusser said.  Disclosure: The author holds small positions in bitcoin and litecoin.

Despite 98% of the votes cast being in favor of a proposed change, the total number needed for a successful vote fell short of the 40 million required by about 400,000.  The vote had been intended, somewhat ironically, to decide whether or not to reduce the token threshold required to make and pass proposals on the protocol.  The final tally in the vote ending earlier on Tuesday, stood at 39,596,759 for, and 696,857 against.  The Ethereum-based protocol utilizes an automated market-making system leveraging liquidity pools so users can exchange or ""swap"" between ether (ETH) and any ERC-20 standard token.  Last month, Uniswap became the first DeFi protocol to surpass the $2 billion milestone in terms of total value locked.  Currently, only individuals holding 1% of the network's native token, UNI, may initiate proposals.  A successful vote would have seen this requirement drop by around a third, while only 30 million votes would be needed to see a proposal passed.  ""Disappointing outcome,"" said Nadav Hollander, CEO and co-founder of crypto lender Dharma, in a tweet because the vote itself demonstrated the need for the proposal.  Dharma had proposed the changes.  However, Hollander also said the vote ""galvanized users to delegate in much higher numbers,"" which was a ""healthy outcome for Uniswap.""

NSX said Tuesday its DLT-based Digital Exchange Subregister System (DESS), part of the ClearPay platform, was approved by the Australian Council of Financial Regulators at its October meeting. It is now working with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on finalizing the process and the date it can go live on the Australian Securities Exchange.      It is aiming to access ASX Clear under the Open Access and Trade Acceptance Service regimes.      DESS is already ""technically and operationally ready for service to commence data accumulation and writing to the blockchain,"" the company said.      As previously reported, DESS is joint venture between NSX and financial services firm iSignthis.      John Karantzis, CEO of iSignthis and NSX, had previously accused the ASX of blocking the venture access to its clearing services. The stock exchange suspended trading in iSignThis shares last October.      ASX said the suspension was in order to hold a review after a market research group raised concerns about iSignthis' disclosures, governance and shareholder structure.      ASX has itself been building a DLT-based clearing house system to replace its ageing CHESS system since 2017.      In a recent announcement, ASIC and the Reserve Bank of Australia told ASX to push on with development with minimal further delays.      NSX said its Nasdaq trading engine will initially be written to both the DESS and CHESS systems.      Unveiled in February, ClearPay uses distributed ledger technology to facilitate same-day settlements and up-to-date accounting between trading participants, the share registry, and the exchange.

42405252,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLiwn,1603166403,R3 Corda Network Set to Go DeFi With XDC Digital Currency,"A group of former bankers building on R3’s public Corda Network are touting the first digital currency for that ecosystem, dubbed XDC.      Announced Tuesday, the Cordite Society, a co-operative registered in the U.K., released the XDC crypto token on public Corda, the open-source version of R3’s network. The new regulation-friendly cryptocoin will open the door, say its creators at Cordite, to various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications running on Corda’s distributed ledger technology (DLT).      R3 began life as a pay-to-join DLT consortium of big banks, which over time realized the value of hosting a large developer community and created the open-source Corda Network alongside the commercial version of the software.      In fact, the idea of a “Corda Coin” was floated at last year’s CordaCon, the annual developer gathering, but only as a research project at that time. Now a reality, the Cordite Society will be minting the first run of 1 million XDC to lubricate applications on Corda. This cooperative is taking advantage of existing U.K. legal structures for mutual societies, a provision also used by DeFi risk mitigation platform Nexus Mutual.      “XDC is a digital currency in its own right,” said ex-RBS banker and Cordite CEO Richard Crook. “It is issued as an exchange token to Cordite Society members, and as it’s minted or created, will be evenly distributed among those cooperative society members.”      The XDC and Cordite Society announcement is timed to coincide with this year’s CordaCon event. R3 did not return requests for comment by press time.      Read more: 85% of Italian Banks Are Exchanging Interbank Transfer Data on Corda      Crook said membership for the newly convened Cordite Society is now open, and members will vote on the rate of supply of XDC and other points of governance going forward. Firms participating in the Cordite decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) will have compliance baked in, Crook added, since R3 designed the Corda network such that each node represents a legal entity, identified by a trusted identity certificate.      This ensures that XDC meets the G20-sanctioned Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards on digital assets to deal with anti-money laundering (AML) risks, a challenge that Ethereum-based DeFi projects continue to be unable to address, Crook said.      “Regulators have set the requirements for what a digital currency needs to be, and that’s exactly where XDC fits in,” said Crook. “It meets the requirements of most jurisdictions as a digital currency and is therefore a step ahead. We’re a next-generation Bitcoin or XRP.”    XDC DeFi    In addition, Crook said the XDC code will pave the way for things like central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to run on Corda (especially since federal regulators in the U.S. recently announced that national banks can hold reserves for stablecoin issuers), and also allow for what he called “a cleaned-up” expansion of DeFi.      “Anything in finance needs to solve the know-your-customer identity problem out of the box, as well as provide privacy between the parties that are transacting,” said Crook. “With many DeFi projects to date, if the technology doesn’t solve that, they seemingly ignore those requirements and wait for regulators to give chase.”      The XDC system, with its reliance on the U.K.’s mutual societies legal structure, shows that the core tenets of DeFi are actually centuries old, said Crook.      Read more: R3 Corda Partners With Kaleido After Ethereum Startup Spins Out of ConsenSys      “It takes us back to that ability for legal entities to come together and share equity or debt and work together for a common aim,” Crook said. “That’s why cooperatives were created in the first place. And that’s why we are showing that with XDC you can mix the legal and the technology components to solve this DeFi requirement set.”      U.K.-based institutional crypto player BCB Prime Services (which works with Bitstamp, Coinbase, Galaxy and Kraken) will provide OTC liquidity and custody services for XDC.      “A globally scalable ‘currency’ use case of cryptocurrencies has been elusive in over a decade of innovation in this space,"" Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, founder and CEO, BCB Group, said in a statement. ""One of the barriers has been closer alignment with existing systems of money, regulations and government, in a way which still preserves the decentralized ethos of the asset class. The XDC digital currency is one of a tiny handful of projects which meets all these complexity criteria and I’m excited to back this project from all angles.”",POSITIVE,XDC,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | XDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/20/r3-corda-network-set-to-go-defi-with-xdc-digital-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ba1b49a742a99375ede4092118f5f780235e580-1500x978.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
