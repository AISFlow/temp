First, Sofus Mortensen, product manager for DAML, DA’s smart contract programming language, has left the company. DAML or Digital Asset Modelling Language is an important part of DA’s strategy to spread its technology beyond the closed proprietary implementations the firm is working on with the likes of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  Mortensen returned to the banking arena, joining Danske Bank, the largest bank in Denmark, as head of architecture and markets IT, according to his LinkedIn profile. Prior to spending almost two years with DA, he was a chief quant at another Nordic institution, Nordea for close to eight years.  In addition, Sallie L. Krawcheck, CEO and Co-Founder of Ellevest, and one of the most notable women in financial services, has quietly left the board of DA. Her name was removed from the company's website a few weeks ago.  Krawcheck joined the DA board almost exactly three years ago, saying at the time that distributed ledger technology (DLT) offered ""a once in a generation opportunity to strengthen financial services as a whole.""  Neither executive responded to requests for comment by press time. DA declined to comment.  Comings and goings  One of a handful of big enterprise blockchain providers, DA has seen a steady exodus of executives since its iconic leader Blythe Masters suddenly departed the company last December.  Last month saw the departure of Gavin Wells, head of Europe, whose client-facing responsibilities were taken over by Oliver Hugh-Jones, head of business development for Europe.  Also in February, James Powell, CIO and CTO of engineering at Digital Asset, left the software company. Powell’s responsibilities at DA were assumed by Shaul Kfir, the CTO of architecture and a member of the founding team.  The 175-employee DA has also been hiring, however. Zohar Hod, a trading technology veteran, was brought in as its chief strategy officer, coinciding with Powell’s departure. Hod reports to co-founder and chief operating officer Yuval Rooz.  DA is busy replacing the ASX's CHESS clearing and settlement system. Although the deadline for that project has been pushed back to early 2021, ASX told CoinDesk in an interview last year that Masters’ departure would not affect its timeline.

The National Council of Clerks (NCC) project has already undergone tests involving four court clerks and IT providers, IBM said Thursday, and the system is planned to go into full-scale production in the first half of 2019. The goal is to allow clerks in commercial courts who maintain the country's Register of Commerce and Companies do their job better and faster.  The clerks will use the system to share regulatory information about the difficulties companies experience, as well as changes in their status, like a change of court office in which a company is registered, name changes, and new branch office openings. When this information needs to be updated, the process can involve multiple regions, so that local registries need to coordinate, and here is where the ""single source of truth"" afforded by blockchain tech can help.  In a pilot, IBM said, making an update to the registry took one day instead of several days. While enhancing the speed and transparency of the system, the technology can also make the French Commercial and Corporate Registry a technological leader in the European Union, IBM believes.  ""This initiative is a first in the justice sector in France and is a perfect example of blockchain's role in helping regulated professions as they transform,"" Vincent Fournier, senior manager for blockchain at IBM France, said in a press release. ""Blockchain's qualities are ideal for this use, improving the clerks' business processes and adapting to the ever-changing nature of their missions.""

As a result of persistent imbalances in the token's supply and demand since February, DAI has been trading below $1 on exchanges – hitting lows of $0.96 on major cryptocurrency exchange platforms such as Coinbase.  Issued via an open-source software, DAI uses what is known as a“Stability Fee” that charges an outstanding fee proportional to the amount of DAI being returned by the user. The fee can be paid in either MKR tokens or DAI. Holders of MKR, however, also participate in decision-making on how the protocol that produces DAI should function and “stake” their tokens in votes.  MKR holders have ratified three different proposals to raise this fee incrementally in the past few weeks. The last increase, executed on Friday, was by far the largest in the history of the project, raising the Stability Fee to 3.5 percent and prompting some concerns about whether the MakerDAO protocol can support a stable cryptocurrency.  In a weekly governance meeting today, risk management lead at the MakerDAO Foundation Cyrus Younessi noted that DAI prices as a result of Friday’s fee hike were “trending in the general right direction pointing to a chart depicting DAI market value weighted across “several different cryptocurrency exchanges.”  However, pointing out that over-the-counter trades of DAI have been unaffected by this fee hike and persist well below the dollar mark, cryptocurrency trader and partner at blockchain-focused VC fund Distributed Capital Partners, Joseph Quintillian, said:  “I’m not seeing good trades above one or even close to $1 … We’re kind of in this $0.95 to $0.99 [over-the-counter range] but nothing over $0.99 yet.”  Echoing this sentiment, head of research at crypto asset manager Wyre Capital, Louis Aboud-Hogben, also said during today’s governance meeting that while “spot prices have moved up a bit … we haven’t been able to clear any trades.”  Aboud-Hogben added:  ""It’s important we don't get lured into a false sense of security here.”  Higher fees  As such, founder of the MakerDAO Foundation Rune Christensen was of the mindset that stronger, more pointed action was warranted by MakerDAO token holders.  “If we’ve seen no effect, I’m of the opinion that we should do a 4 percent increase,” said Christensen, adding that former Stability Fee increases thus far have had only “superficial effects on markets.”  Wanting to move ahead with some sort of actionable vote ""as soon as possible,"" Christensen suggested a vote for a more measured increase of 2 percent from the current 3.5 percent. The suggestion, however, was regarded as too hasty by some community members.  Pushing back on setting ""arbitrary"" numerical values to the next potential fee hike without proper data analysis, Richard Brown – head of core community at the MakerDAO Foundation – directed the discussion to be further debated on the community Reddit channel.  “Let’s make sure this debate doesn’t peeter out and that it continues on our Reddit channel … [Our decision] needs to be scientifically-based,” emphasized Brown.

42381694,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oJD5,1552577411,Bitfury Integration to Bring Bitcoin Lightning Payments to More Merchants,"The Bitfury Group has partnered with business payments processor HadePay to bring lightning network-based bitcoin payments to merchants in the U.S., Canada and the EU.  Bitfury announced Thursday that it has integrated its web-based lightning network Peach Merchant API (application programming interface) with HadePay’s platform, allowing businesses to accept payments over the lightning network and ""improving the efficiency and lowering the costs"" of bitcoin transactions.  After payment is made, merchants can “immediately” convert bitcoins into another currency through HadePay's platform, Bitfury said.  “By bringing the Lightning Network to HadePay’s payment processing platform, we are making it easier for businesses across the United States to accept bitcoin payments,” said Pavel Prikhodko, head of Lightning Peach, Bitfury’s team of lightning network developers.  Bitcoin payments via HadePay are now available in all 50 U.S. states, Bitfury added.  HadePay runs on a hybrid model, processing both fiat and blockchain payments. The platform can also be used by merchants around the world to accept payments through PayPal, Apple Pay, Square and more.  HadePay CEO and founder Brian Nichols said:  “Bitcoin has always been a good low-cost alternative to fiat payments, but with this integration Bitcoin payments are now equally convenient as our fiat payment processing services, thereby paving the way for mass adoption in commerce.”  It's worth noting that the lightning network, a second-layer scalability protocol that operates on top of the bitcoin blockchain, is still a beta project (several projects, actually) with some risks attached to its use. Its several iterations continue to develop and see support from the community, however.  Some big name firms and individuals have been supporting the technology in an ongoing experiment known as the Lightning Torch, with financial services giant Fidelity Investments, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey all recently taking part.

In a speech before the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress on Tuesday, McCarthy said that blockchain is “revolutionizing” the security of the financial industry and that it can also help transform the “transparency of our own legislative process.""  “Why would we wait around and why wouldn’t we institute blockchain on our own?” he asked, adding:  “As technology continues to change our life, let’s make sure Congress has the same ability to do it ... to make this place more effective, more efficient, and most importantly more accountable.”  McCarthy also gave a couple of examples of how embracing innovative technologies through passing new legislation in the past has helped improve government processes.  Such bills, he said, include the Tested Ability to Leverage Exceptional National Talent Act (TALENT) Act, establishing a bug bounty program for the Department of Homeland Security through the Strengthening and Enhancing Cyber-capabilities by Utilizing Risk Exposure Technology Act, and the Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses Act.  “So as technology continues to change our life, let’s make sure Congress has the same ability to do it,” McCarthy said, concluding:  “What I’m looking for is building greater confidence in the institution that we have – utilizing the 21st century technology to make us more customer friendly but at the same time give us greater information that can hold us accountable in this process.”  Last July, McCarthy, along with a group of U.S. lawmakers, also proposed the creation of a blockchain pilot as part of a wider effort to combat infectious fungal diseases.

The new text states that while its stablecoin is 100 percent backed, its reserves may at times include other assets.  The website reads:  Every tether is always 100% backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities (collectively, “reserves”).  However, Tether’s previous terms, as seen on the Internet Archive in mid-February, indicated full fiat backing:  “Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves. So 1 USD₮ is always equivalent to 1 USD.”  Tether has been at the center of questions over whether the firm has sufficient reserves to back its 1.9 billion USDT in circulation, although one report suggested it did, at least during specific time windows.  Last December, Bloomberg News reported that it has seen Tether bank statements indicating that, over four separate months at least, the company held sufficient dollars to back the USDT tokens on the market.  Much of the controversy around the firm arises from the fact that Tether has never provided a full independent audit of its dollar collateral. However, in November it released a letter from Bahamas-based Deltec Bank as proof of reserves.  Tether and its sister firm, crypto exchange Bitfinex, were reportedly subpoenaed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in December 2017 although it was not stated why at the time.

The institution added that the move is aimed to make investors' experiences faster and more convenient, as well as ""opening up new investment opportunities.""  In the third quarter of 2019, Thailand’s capital market will see “a real transformation” in two areas, the SET said. Firstly, there would be full digitization of infrastructure, including paperless account opening process, electronic payment of stamp duty and direct-debit registration processes.  Secondly, to access more investment opportunities, the stock exchange's FundConnext mutual fund platform – which is currently connected to 19 asset management firms in Thailand – will be linked with Vestima, a global fund processing platform operated by Clearstream.  Also in Q3, the exchange said it will improve its interbank payments process to make it “more effective” both operationally and financially for securities firms.  The SET first revealed its plans to offer a digital assets platform back in January, saying it was planning to apply for a license from the country’s Ministry of Finance to operate the platform.

According to an analysis by Keybanc reported by CNBC, the move now gives Kaleido clients access to more than 80 percent of cloud infrastructure clients, with support for the top two providers of cloud services. According to the company, this means that potential future Kaleido clients don't need to worry about which their business partners use.  ""Our customers’ digital ecosystems can now grow and scale wherever and however the participants require,"" Steve Cerveny, Kaleido Founder and CEO, said in a release. The news means that Kaleido clients should have less friction adopting its products, because they don't need to worry about persuading business partners to move from Microsoft's cloud infrastructure to Amazon's (or vice versa).  Launched in May 2018, ConsenSys-backed Kaleido was built to make it easier for large organizations to move from blockchain pilots to production. Originally created as a collaboration between AWS and the Brooklyn-based venture studio, it was launched with support for business consortiums in mind.  In its announcement, Kaleido cited building blockchain networks with established brands, such as T-Mobile, Sony, Fox, UnionBank and others.  One Kaleido client, Komgo, provides information for commodity traders, so that single source of truth is available to all market participants. By running on both Azure and AWS, Kaleido makes it easier for potential participants in the network to choose to use Komgo as a source of information, according to blockchain firm.  “As networks on-board new members and scale, these sorts of capabilities from Kaleido are critical to remove friction and tear down barriers to adoption,” Souleïma Baddi, CEO of Komgo, said in the release.  Indeed, as ZDNet reported, many potential enterprise customers have chosen to use more than one major cloud service provider, meaning interoperability between cloud services is key to broadening blockchain adoption.  Kaleido's Cerveny noted:  ""We’ve built our platform across the leading public clouds including Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services to give our clients the ability to create global, cross-cloud networks.

42381708,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oJTR,1552561824,Bitcoin Trades Flat While Altcoins Tease Bull Breakout,"View  Bitcoin is lacking clear directional bias for a ninth straight day, neutralizing the bullish view put forward by a long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. As a result, a return to levels below $3,700 cannot be ruled out.  A UTC close above the March 9 high of $3,950 would revive the short-term bullish outlook and possibly yield a rally toward the recent high of $4,190.  While a few alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) have recently witnessed a longer-term bull reversal, the altcoin market as a whole is yet to exit the bear market. That could be about to change, though, as there are growing signs of seller exhaustion.  A bull breakout in the altcoin market would be confirmed if and when the overall altcoin market capitalization beats the long-term falling trendline resistance, currently at $64.28 billion.  Bitcoin's struggle for direction continues amid growing signs of a bull reversal in alternative cryptocurrencies.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is trapped in the range of $3,800 to $3,900 for a ninth straight day, contradicting the quick move toward the recent high of $4,190 suggested by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. The immediate outlook, therefore, is neutral.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is flatlined at $3,847 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.10 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Further, BTC is reporting a meager 4 percent gain on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, as opposed to stellar gains in few altcoins. For instance, litecoin, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently up 83.9 percent on a YTD basis.  Binance coin (BNB) and holochain (HOT) are up at least 140 percent each, while EOS (EOS) and ontology (ONT) have gained 40 percent and 69 percent, respectively, according to OnChainFX.  Meanwhile, both the BTC and USD pairs of LTC, BNB, Tron (TRX) and Maker (MKR) have found acceptance above their respective 200-day moving average (MA) – a widely followed barometer of bull/bear markets.  As a result, speculation that the altcoin market has entered the bull market is gathering steam. However, while few alternative cryptocurrencies seem to have witnessed a bull reversal, the altcoin market as a whole is yet to violate the bearish trend, as seen in the chart below.  Altcoin market cap  On the weekly chart, the altcoin market capitalization (market cap) printed a higher low near $45 billion in early February, signaling bearish exhaustion. However, the trendline connecting January 2018 and April 2018 highs is still intact.  A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $64.28 billion (trendline resistance) could be considered an early sign of longer-term bullish reversal.  A bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, would be confirmed, if and when, the market cap jumps above $68.61 billion – a bearish lower high created on Dec. 24.  Bitcoin's daily chart  The week-long price consolidation in the range of $3,800-$3,900 seen in the above chart has weakened the bullish case put forward by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27. As a result, the 100-day MA support at $3,670 could again come into play.  On the higher side, a UTC close above $3,950 is needed to revive the short-term bullish outlook.

42381692,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oJAZ,1552557661,"Cryptocurrencies Pose Risks to Banks, Warns Basel Committee","The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a group of international banking authorities, has warned that the growth of cryptocurrencies poses a number of risks to banks and global financial stability.  The committee – part of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), widely considered the central bank of central banks – published a statement on Wednesday, saying that potential risks for banks include liquidity, credit and market risks, operational risk (including fraud and cyber risks), money laundering and terrorist financing risk, and legal and reputational risks.  Although banks currently have “very limited” direct exposure to cryptocurrencies, institutions should still ""at a mimimum"" carry out extensive due diligence and disclose any exposure to crypto assets to minimize the risks, the committee said.  Banks should further have a “clear and robust” risk management framework to deal with the “high degree” of risk posed by cryptocurrencies.  The risk management framework should be “fully integrated” into banks’ overall risks management processes, including those relating to anti-money laundering (AML), combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) and evasion of sanctions, the committee said.  A “comprehensive” assessment of the risks should be incorporated into their internal capital and liquidity adequacy assessment processes, it added.  Additionally, supervisory bodies should be informed of actual or planned cryptocurrency exposure, along with assurance that the institution has fully assessed and mitigated the risks.  Finally, the committee said that it is working with other global standard-setting bodies and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to arrive at guidance on “prudential treatment” of banks’ exposure to cryptocurrencies in order to “appropriately” reflect the risks.  Last June, BIS said in its Annual Economic Report that it's hard to see if cryptocurrencies solve any specific economic problem yet. “Transactions are slow and costly, prone to congestion, and cannot scale with demand,” it said at the time.

42381691,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oJ83,1552555806,Court Rules Quoine Exchange Liable for Reversing Bitcoin Trades Worth Millions,"The Singapore International Commercial Court has ruled against cryptocurrency exchange Quoine after it reversed trades for a total of 3,092 bitcoins (BTC) by crypto market maker B2C2 two years ago.  The court published a case summary Thursday, stating that it found Quoine liable for the “breach of contract and breach of trust” in reversing B2C2’s trades made at an “abnormal” exchange rate back in April 2017.  B2C2 had made seven trades in which it sold ether (ETH) at an exchange rate of 10 BTC per token – approximately 250 times higher than the market rate of about 0.04 BTC to 1 ETH at the time, according to the court document.  The proceeds of the trades were then automatically credited to B2C2’s account by Quoine, and the corresponding amount of 309 ETH was debited. But, a day later, when Quoine discovered the abnormality, it canceled the seven trades and reset the balances to their pre-trades state.  In August 2017, B2C2 sued Quoine, aiming to recover the 3,092 BTC (worth almost $12 million at press time) from the exchange.  B2C2 at the time said that Quoine “had no contractual right unilaterally to cancel the trades once the orders had been effected.”  While the court has sided with B2C2 in its ruling, it declined to order Quoine to transfer 3,092 BTC back to B2C2, given that the price is “substantially higher” than the price in April 2017 when the trades were executed. Back then, a bitcoin was worth around $1,300, while today the price is around $3,850.  “Instead, the plaintiff’s [B2C2] remedy lay only in damages which, if not agreed, will be assessed at a subsequent hearing,” the court said.  This is one of the court's first judgments involving cryptocurrencies, in which it found that cryptocurrencies have the “hallmark characteristics of property.”  In response to the ruling, Quoine issued a statement on Thursday, stating that it was disappointed with the judgement.  Quoine CEO Mike Kayamori said:  ""We are reviewing the judgment and considering our options, including the possibility of an appeal.”  Gavel and bitcoin image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,ASIA | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/14/court-rules-quoine-exchange-liable-for-reversing-bitcoin-trades-worth-millions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f0d61f30f262d548f343bc4b663a16f8c75dcdce-1500x953.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced today, the exchange now allows companies to list their security tokens previously issued on other platforms. Institutional investors in Europe can purchase the tokens on the exchange for fiat, bitcoin, ether, tether and XRP.  However, to start with, only one such token will be listed on DX.Exchange – its native IGWT token.  Eventually, the platform's co-founder Daniel Skowronski told CoinDesk, the company will roll out its own technology for asset tokenization, but for now, it will facilitate the trading of existing security tokens.  As for the native token, 18 million IGWT will be offered in a closed security token offering (STO) for a limited time, and afterward, 10 percent of the company's profits will be regularly distributed to the token holders, DX.Exchange pledged.  Currently, the platform is functioning in a closed regime for some 8,000 pre-registered users, Skowronski told CoinDesk, with the main launch planned for April. Users can currently trade 10 cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ether, litecoin, bitcoin cash, OmiseGo, XRP and others.  They can also purchase and trade ERC-20 tokens backed by real-world securities, such as stocks of Tesla, Google, Facebook, Amazon and 30 more. The stocks are purchased and held by the brokerage MPS Marketplace Securities Ltd. registered in Cyprus.  “Our vision is to bridge the gap between the old world and the new digital world,” Skowronski said in a press release. “We believe that all assets whether its securities, art or real-estate will be tokenized. This tokenization has many benefits but the strongest is the ability to help create wealth for people all over the world no matter their social economic situation.”  Because of the regulatory hurdles, the company doesn't offer its service to the U.S. users and isn't planning to do so in the coming months, Skowronski told CoinDesk.

42381710,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oEXj,1552539613,Privacy Cryptocurrency Grin Votes to Fund Third Full-Time Developer,"Long-time Grin coder “Ignotus Peverell” will receive financial support to work on the cryptocurrency, a move that makes him the nascent project's third paid team member.  In a weekly governance meeting Tuesday, developers voted to fund Peverell for his work on Grin with roughly $10,000 per month. With 4,919,040 GRIN tokens in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap, the estimated market capitalization of the cryptocurrency is well over $13 million.  Grin, being a relatively new blockchain, went live in mid-January in a bid to implement the privacy-enhancing protocol “MimbleWimble,"" designed to obfuscate transaction details such as amount and account addresses. Named after a tongue-tying curse in J.K. Rowling’s best-selling Harry Potter books, the name Ignotus Peverell itself is a pseudonym that references a character within the series.  In the context of the Grin community, Peverell was one of the original creators of the Grin project who back in 2016 started the first implementation of the mimblewimble protocol on GitHub.  A user by the name of “Antioch Peverell” – another Harry Potter character reference – was similarly voted up by the community in late February. Before this, user “Yeastplume” was the sole full-time funded Grin developer.  Yeastplume told CoinDesk:  “There’s no [official] roles. We just continue to work on what we see fit, which so far seems to be working okay.”  Emphasizing in a public Gitter channel that being funded for Grin development work was “risky employment,” Yeastplume later characterized the financial support as more akin to donations.  Audit ahead  Tuesday's governance meeting also confirmed the “contract and payment” of security auditing firm Coinspect.  Having decided to conduct a third-party review of Grin’s “cryptographic and consensus-critical code,"" community members unanimously voted to employ Coinspect over other auditors such as Quarkslab and NCC last month.  Now, having paid a fee up-front to the company of roughly $17,000, Grin community members expect a draft report by April 20. “It’s going to come quickly. They’ve also already produced one excellent vulnerability report,” stated Ignotus Peverell.  As stated on a Github, the estimated cost of the audit is roughly $80,000.  Funds are sourced from the “Grin General Fund,” which back in December of last year raised 17.28 BTC, with an estimated worth at press time of $66,500 specifically for the purposes of this security audit.

42381688,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oEcl,1552533656,"Crypto Mogul Moshe Hogeg's ICOs Have Unusual Patterns, Analysis Finds","Best-known internationally as the chief executive of the blockchain smartphone startup Sirin Labs, Moshe Hogeg is becoming known for something else in Israel – mounting lawsuits.  As reported extensively by regional news outlets, a lawsuit filed in January claims Hogeg misappropriated funds from the sale of new cryptocurrencies for both his own gain and to benefit his investment portfolio, including Sirin Labs. The judge has reportedly given Hogeg until March 15 to settle with the plaintiff, Chinese investor Zhewen Hu. (Update, March 14, 22:05 UTC: Israeli judge Judge Michal Amit-Anisman has given Hogeg and the plaintiff another two months to settle the conflict out of court, according to Globes newspaper.)  This follows an earlier case involving Hogeg’s company Invest.com that has since been settled.  Specifically, in the case of the ICO for the startup Stox, a company co-founded by Hogeg and endorsed by boxer Floyd Mayweather (resulting in a fine from the SEC), the lawsuit claims Hogeg inappropriately withdrew proceeds from its $35 million ICO and used the funds for other projects, including Sirin Labs, his VC firm Singulariteam and the blockchain startup Orbs.  The Stox lawsuit, which focuses on several sections of the startup’s white paper, alleges Hogeg encouraged people to invest in the Stox ICO by touting a partnership with his own firm, Invest.com, having effectively “made a contract with himself” to inflate interest in the offering. It also says Hogeg presented himself on Telegram as a mere investor rather than a leader of the project, giving the illusion of more participants.  As for the lawsuit related to Stox, Hogeg told CoinDesk: “The whole matter is completely made up” and “will be quickly resolved in court.”  The Stox lawsuit also mentions allegedly mismanaged funds going to Sirin Labs, the startup of which Hogeg is currently CEO. Sirin raised more than $157 million in a 2017 token sale and is now seeking distribution partners for its Finney smartphone. Hogeg said he is himself one of the leading investors in Sirin Labs. After leaving Stox in 2017, he took the reins of the company from Kazakhstani investor and Sirin Labs founder Kenges Rakishev.  The lawsuit claims some of the funds Hogeg allegedly mismanaged during the Stox ICO, before he joined Sirin Labs, were distributed in some fashion to the blockchain company Orbs.  Beyond the Stox ICO, Hogeg was listed that same year as an advisor to the LeadCoin ICO, launched by a startup called Webydo that Hogeg also invested in through Singulariteam. Singulariteam’s second managing partner is Rakishev.  Tangled web  In light of the questions that have been raised about Stox and Sirin Labs, CoinDesk partnered with the blockchain analytics firm Alethio, part of the Brooklyn conglomerate ConsenSys, to use its new reporting tools to explore the ICOs in which Hogeg has been involved.  Alethio prepared a three-pronged report detailing its analysis, which covered the Stox ICO, the Sirin Labs ICO and the LeadCoin ICO.  The report concludes that all three ICOs have a single top holder in common, a wallet that as of February 2019 still held roughly 3 percent of the supply of all three tokens, respectively. This wallet, 0x8c373ed467f3eabefd8633b52f4e1b2df00c9fe8, also engaged in a unique pattern of transfers during the LeadCoin ICO, which will be explored below.  Although the blockchain analysis by Alethio doesn’t show who controlled any wallets, and Hogeg’s spokesperson declined to clarify if they are aware of the owners, the blockchain analysis did show that the wallet with all three tokens received LeadCoin tokens indirectly, through a repeating pattern of proxy transfers, from the LeadCoin sale itself.  Separately, Alethio also found that during Sirin Labs' SRN token sale, one wallet received 4,564 ETH from the SRN sale’s official wallet. This second wallet (0x59b681402bcb2c8460a506a88d75be1cf1326528), later sent back the same amount of ETH to the SRN sale’s account, potentially creating the appearance of more activity.  Alethio data scientist Danning Sui explained that her team “found a circle of ETH transfers” related to the SRN ICO. Lastly, this second wallet eventually received 50 percent of all SRN tokens, according to Alethio’s analysis. Many of the SRN tokens from this wallet appeared to end up on exchanges shortly after the sale.  Both of these examined wallets have transaction histories that are publicly recorded on the ethereum blockchain.  Hogeg’s spokesperson said they could not share information about the wallet that recycled ETH funds in the Sirin Labs ICO and eventually received half of the token supply, except to say: “This wallet participated in Sirin Labs’ presale.”  When asked why this wallet received SRN tokens from the sale, Hogeg’s spokesperson replied: “We cannot share additional information.”  What the blockchain says  Sui explained that the blockchain data does not suggest any connection between the parties that operated these wallets involved with withdrawals from the LeadCoin sale and Sirin Labs sale, respectively.  Nor does the data suggest there is a pattern that connects these three sales other than common investors, such as the wallet 0x8c373ed467f3eabefd8633b52f4e1b2df00c9fe8, which is a top holder of tokens from Sirin Labs, LeadCoin and Stox.  Regardless of who operated that top holder wallet during the LeadCoin token sale, Alethio’s analysis showed patterns of it receiving LeadCoin tokens from 14 wallets. The source of those LeadCoin tokens, albeit with proxy transfers in between, can be traced back to the original sale contract, as illustrated below:  In short, tokens appear to have gone from the official LeadCoin issuance contract, through numerous independent wallets, to a single wallet that also happened to be one of the top-10 holders of SRN and STX, according to Alethio’s analysis.  Sirin Lab’s spokesperson said this wallet from the LeadCoin sale has nothing to do with Singulariteam group nor Hogeg’s secondary consulting firm Alignment Group, adding:  “Chances are it belongs to one of the brokers in this industry. If it has LeadCoin tokens it’s probably because the owner has invested in LeadCoin.”  Alethio’s new suite of investigative tools are not intended to guide interpretation of the data, Sui said. Instead, these tools are merely meant to help people make more informed decisions based on understanding the flow of funds.  Alignment Group  Aside from the above-mentioned lawsuit, it appears that some of Hogeg’s relationships with other companies across the crypto ecosystem may now be strained.  Since joining the blockchain sector in 2013, Hogeg has invested in and worked with many of Israel’s crypto startups. Hogeg is the owner of both the VC fund Singulariteam and the blockchain consulting firm Alignment Group. A press release issued in 2017 indicated that Alignment was being founded as a “blockchain hub” by Hogeg’s Singulariteam, the blockchain firm BlockchainIL and crypto investment group CoinTree Capital, run by Uriel Peled, also the founder of Orbs. The press release also noted that Alignment’s clients included Bancor, and features a photo of Bancor co-founder Eyal Herzog.  The Bancor company logo remains listed on the consulting firm’s portfolio page. However, while Sirin Labs partnered with Bancor in the SRN token sale and Bancor published a Facebook post about SRN, a Bancor spokesperson told CoinDesk that “no Bancor founders have ever worked with Moshe Hogeg as an investor” and they did not have any “agreement with Alignment Group.”  The company logo for Orbs also appears on the Alignment website. An Orbs spokesperson told CoinDesk that although ""several Orbs founders initially considered involvement in Alignment,” none of them officially took part. Orbs founder and former CoinTree CEO Peled was also featured as a LeadCoin advisor on that ICO’s website in 2017, a connection Orbs denied as well.  Hogeg told CoinDesk that within a few short weeks after establishing Alignment, both of the other entrepreneurs – Peled and Herzog – left the advisory firm, leaving him as the sole owner. While an Orbs spokesperson denied involvement with any of Hogeg’s crypto projects, CoinDesk was able to confirm with the Orbs team that Hogeg invested in Orbs through Singulariteam.  Avishai Ziv, CEO of both Singulariteam and Alignment, told CoinDesk that his companies invested in both Bancor and Orbs. Ziv explained these investments sometimes took the form of services provided by Alignment, traditional fiat investments through Singulariteam or cryptocurrency sent by Hogeg, depending on the context.  “Singulariteam, as a venture company, is not allowed to participate in any ICO,” Ziv said of current legal restrictions in Israel. “So, maybe sometimes Moshe is doing it on a personal level. Maybe sometimes other partners are also doing it on a personal level. Alignment mainly gets payments in light of service agreements before the ICO.”  Singulariteam CFO Guy Elhanani is also simultaneously the CFO of Sirin Labs.  As for the lawsuit, it claims that Hogeg urged investors to participate in the Stox ICO by claiming the token could be listed on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The consulting firm Hogeg owns called Alignment Group lists Binance on its portfolio page.  However, a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""We have no affiliation with Alignment Group. Our guess is that the firm has included the Binance logo on their website to indicate their personal portfolio of projects, ie. they may be holders of Binance Coin (BNB). We have no affiliation with STOX or Moshe.""  Sirin Labs  Much like both the Stox and LeadCoin tokens, Sirin Labs’ SRN token suffered in the broader market since ether prices dropped.  According to ICO-class-action.org, there are now 52 people interested in filing a new lawsuit against Sirin Labs because that SRN asset and its blockchain ecosystem may not have sufficient value. As of the time of press, it is unclear who the plaintiffs would be or what the details of this alleged case would be, although a representative from the site confirmed that documentation for this prospective case is proceeding.  Speaking of the broader market sentiment that might have influenced how people view his projects, Hogeg told CoinDesk:  “We’ve seen a lot of value that was invested in the [blockchain] industry but there was not a lot of value created for real users.”  As for Sirin Labs, a Ukrainian retailer called Legio LLC confirmed it will soon start selling Sirin phones in Ukraine. A Sirin Labs spokesperson told CoinDesk more than 10,000 phones have been manufactured so far and the company plans to open a flagship store in Tokyo this April.  Hogeg said such “real products” will take the blockchain technology “to mass markets,” concluding:  ""What I see right now is a lot of bullshit is getting out of the industry and the real people who really understand the industry, the philosophy and the potential behind it, they are staying.""
