42425837,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgRJh,1403906169,How Hive's New Web Wallet Attacks Bitcoin Adoption Roadblocks,"Hive, a startup specializing in cryptocurrency wallets, recently released Hive Web, a browser-based wallet that can be used on any device that supports HTML5, a feature now common on most smartphone devices.  Hive Web complements two other wallets in Hive’s lineup: one for Mac OS X and a mobile version on Android.  Hive  CEO Wendell Davis told CoinDesk his company started working on Hive’s HTML5 wallet in February after Apple removed all wallet apps with bitcoin sending functionality on iOS.  ""The original idea was that we couldn’t make an iOS app. So let's make really nice, native feeling HTML5 wallet.""  Apple has since updated its policies to allow bitcoin apps, though Wendell believes Hive Web has a lot to offer consumers, even those who may now have a broader range of wallet apps to choose from.  Unique product  Davis believes that Hive has created something not previously available in the cryptocurrency space with its latest release.  In a crowded industry full of cryptocurrency wallets, no other company has yet issued an HTML5 product built for ubiquitous, standalone cryptocurrency storage and payments, he argues:  ""There’s none like this. HTML5 wallets specifically, mobile targeted, a lot of people have talked about releasing one of these. But, I think we’re the first to [do this].""  The HTML5 offering is a fairly minimalist wallet so far – partly because the initial version still needs to be integrated with contacts and Hive's own app store. But, Davis says those features are coming soon.  This should give a boost to the product, since Hive’s integration of third-party cryptocurrency applications within its internal app store is a big differentiator from other wallets on the market.  Waggle  The ability to transmit payments with a brand-new feature called 'Waggle' is also unique to the web wallet. Waggle uses location-based services to allow easy payment within the wallet, a feature that attacks a major consumer pain point.  Bitcoin is excellent as a remote digital payment, but is still seeing growing pains at the traditional point of sale. While many wallet users transact bitcoin with the use of QR codes, Waggle frees people from the often-onerous task of scanning these tools at the point of sale.  Davis elaborated:  ""Waggle actually lets you make local payments. You turn Waggle on, and it basically broadcasts your general location.""  Clicking on the Waggle button from inside the wallet will bring up a map that shows nearby Hive users. This makes it easy for one party to pay another.  Access to 'tokens'  Bitcoin is and will continue to be king, but the Hive team also strongly believes in alternative cryptocurrencies.  As a result, the company plans to make its wallet cryptocurrency agnostic – the first wallet from the company to offer support for an altcoin, with its implementation of basic litecoin support.  And litecoin is just the beginning. In Hive’s view, all block chain technologies are 'tokens'. As such, the company’s product roadmap is to allow for the addition of more altcoins.  Davis explained:  ""The vision is that we want Hive to basically support everything. We’re not making judgments about what’s valuable and what’s not.""  Hive plans to offer its users a distributed API that will be able to access the web wallet’s GUI, a preview of which is here:  The API will enable developers to add tokens – an enticing feature for organizations that might be looking for a custom-tailored cryptocurrency wallet.  Davis says that he believes there is a bright future not just for coins as payment, but also things like digital contracts and other assets. In essence, the company is ensuring it is prepared to support new block chain technologies as they come along.  New wallet technologies  Hive Web is a BIP32 hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet. An HD wallet has a few advantages. One of them is that it allows a user to generate large numbers of key pairs from one master key.  The master key in an HD wallet is able to recover all child keys, which eliminates the need to backup a wallet as long as a user controls the master key. This only requires the safe storage of a password, Davis says:  ""All you need is that 12-character passphrase and it can regenerate the structure of your wallet. There’s no need to do backups of wallet files anymore.""  The concept is similar to having separate bank accounts. It’s quite normal to have a checking and a savings account, for instance.  Hive believes that HD wallets are the future and that it is clear that the technology surrounding cryptocurrency storage has been improving over the past year as more people are using various wallets.  Both HD and multi-signature technologies will be important for cryptocurrency wallets going forward.  Hive's products and its use of HD are squarely focused on consumers being able to access different stores of coin from any location or device.  BitGo  , another startup focusing on wallet tech, is using multi-signature concepts, and aims to cater to enterprises, another nascent yet promising market.  Mobility  With the addition of Hive Web, Hive now has three separate products. Each exists on a different platform: PC, smartphone and now the browser, and they all are different in design and functionality.  Davis says that Hive plans to consolidate the company’s wallets down to a unified software version. ""All these products are going to start to come together. It’s difficult to gauge on a roadmap when that’s going to happen. But it is on our agenda,"" he said.  What’s important for Hive, according to Davis, is to focus on mobile functionality.  ""People don’t travel everywhere with their laptop or desktop computer.""  Because of this, Hive believes that creating a wallet for everyday spending is key for the company’s success.  Competition  Davis says that other wallet providers such as Kryptokit and Blockchain are rumored to be working on HTM5 wallets, so the company does expect to have some competition in this particular space at some point soon.  With competition in mind, and in order to remain well funded, the company is planning to launch a crowdsale to raise money. Davis says the crowdfunding effort is going to happen ""soon"", with the funds raised being used to keep pushing the company's wallet technology forward.  Hive wants to continue building ubiquitous access to cryptocurrencies, whether its tokens, coins – no matter what specific name users want to use for distributed forms of value.  Whatever the future holds, Hive wants to be there to enable users to spend these digital assets in any form.  Davis concludes:  ""Our goal is to try and raise $5m in cryptocurrency on the platform of ‘token neutrality’.""

42425839,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgRLh,1403902308,Vericoin: The Altcoin You Can Spend Wherever Bitcoin is Accepted,"Vericoin has launched an innovative and potentially game-changing approach to gaining merchant acceptance that could shake up the altcoin world should the service gain broader usage.  Launched in May, vericoin is a proof-of-stake altcoin that features a variable interest rate which fluctuates depending on how many coins are staking. As more coins are used to stake and support the network, the interest rate climbs.  One of the ways in which alternative digital currencies seek a broader audience is through expanding merchant acceptance. Companies like Coinkite and CoinPayments.net enable payments in altcoins, but it remains unclear exactly how successful these efforts have been at expanding the number of merchants that take alternative digital currencies as a payment method.  To date, roadblocks have emerged owing to the infrastructure an altcoin needs to be accepted by merchants and the varied willingness on the part of these businesses to accept a potentially volatile digital currency.  Enter VeriBit  Vericoin sidesteps these obstacles entirely with VeriBit, a value-added service to the network that enables people to make smaller bitcoin purchases with their vericoin. VeriBit acts as a go-through for vericoin spenders, facilitating purchases for consumers at any business that accepts bitcoin.  This new service opens up the tens of thousands of merchants currently accepting bitcoin to consumers who wish to use vericoin.  CoinDesk spoke with co-creator Patrick Nosker, who said that prior to a feature like VeriBit, those who wanted to use an altcoin to make a payment had to exchange a set amount for bitcoin. But, because of factors such as exchange fees and the natural volatility of a marketplace, consumers face the real risk of losing value prior to making their purchase.  Nosker said:  ""It’s not very simple for a beginner. So what we made is a transaction layer between exchanges and the user.""  VeriBit is geared toward smaller transactions rather than large ones. Currently, there is a spending limit of 0.15 BTC (roughly $87 at press time), though according to Nosker, this cap is expected to rise in the future.  How VeriBit works  VeriBit is designed to be a user-friendly way to pay for bitcoin purchases using vericoin. The vericoin development team acts as a payments processor for these transactions, operating one wallet for vericoin to be deposited into by a paying consumer and another one that pays out to the payment destination in bitcoin.  To make a payment, you first enter the address you want to send bitcoin to and how much BTC you wish to transfer. After you’ve entered in the information, VeriBit calculates how much vericoin you need to send, plus a 2 VRC transaction fee.  You then have 20 minutes to send your vericoins to the address, after which the wallet operators - currently the vericoin development team - complete the transaction and send out the BTC to its destination.  According to Nosker, the feature stays funded through donations and the exchange of vericoin fees for more bitcoin. He said that VeriBit was developed largely to build more services into the network rather than make money off of user transactions, saying:  ""We didn’t want to get into the exchange business or make tons of money doing this. It’s really just to make vericoin usable immediately. [The fee] just covers the cost of doing it.""  Ultimately, he said, the goal is to create an incentive for consumers to use an altcoin by allowing them to spend it wherever bitcoin is accepted.  Vericoin’s anonymity service  In addition to VeriBit, the vericoin team has also developed several other services that appeal to both mainstream consumers and more seasoned altcoin users.  One of the major forces in altcoin at this time is the anonymous transaction movement. This cluster of altcoin projects, led by projects like darkcoin and XC, focuses on anonymizing transactions to render them invisible to detection efforts.  Nosker noted that anonymity, by and large, is not a feature that appeals to most people. But in acknowledgement of demand for such functionality, the team produced a tool to hide transations though it stopped short of instituting it across the vericoin network.  VeriSend  is a transaction-mixing service that, for a fee, scrambles vericoin transfers and makes them harder - but not impossible, Nosker clarified - to detect.  He added that the vericoin team at one point looked into creating a standard anonymizing system, but ultimately passed on integrating one.  In the future, VeriSend will be added to the alt’s wallet, at which time users can opt to use VeriSend or not.  Text-based management  Another vericoin-based service, VeriSMS, functions as text-based gateway and wallet system that links the cell network to the vericoin network. Vericoin users can load vericoins onto this wallet and use the SMS network to make transactions.  VeriSMS works on an international level. According to the VeriSMS webpage, there are a variety of gateway numbers that can be used in the US, Europe and Asia.  The service offers three commands to users. The balance feature can be used to actually create a wallet address and later utilized to check the amounts currently deposited. Users can type in addresses to send transactions and set passwords for their wallet. This creates a simple security feature should a person’s phone be compromised.  Nosker cautioned that VeriSMS remains in the alpha stage, and that there are risks to using it, telling CoinDesk:  ""It’s not perfect. We’re still ironing out bugs with it.""  Nosker added that the team is exploring other projects, including one that could facilitate vericoin-to-fiat transactions, that tie in to the ultimate goal of making an altcoin that is as consumer-friendly as it is functional.

42395316,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLSc,1403897714,Timeline Silk Road: From the Black Market to the Auction Block,"Though the bitcoin economy waits with bated breath for the end of today's US government auction of 30,000 BTC, at press time, the price of bitcoin has remained resilient, even rising in the face of the day's uncertainty.  Still, industry observers may be curious to learn more about why the auction was initiated as well as the agency conducting the event.  For those answers, we'll take a look at the history of both Silk Road, the online black market from which the bitcoins were seized, and the US Marshals Service (USMS), the federal agency tasked with overseeing the auction.  Who are the US Marshals?  One of the duties of the USMS is to dispose of seized assets.  This graphic below shows the value of assets they held over three years. In 2010 these assets were comprised of 91% cash and financial instruments, 3.5% real property and 3.4% vehicles. That's 4,400 vehicles in all for the year. Data is missing for 2011.  Besides getting rid of seized assets, the Marshals are also in charge of transporting prisoners within the penal system. The airborne method by which it transports prisoners is known as 'Con Air'.  This term also serves as the title of a 1997 Nicholas Cage movie about prisoners being transported by air, of course.  The Marshals also apprehend fugitives from the law. They maintain a '15 Most Wanted' list of individuals, which it warns are ""armed and dangerous"". In May, for example, it apprehended a man that was an alleged 'enforcer' for a street gang called 'Zoe Pound'. The man is wanted for a triple homicide, among other serious crimes.  The USMS says it has captured 211 'Most Wanted' fugitives since 1983.  What is Silk Road?  Though once one of the largest contributors to the overall bitcoin economy, Silk Road was shut down in October of last year by the US FBI, though another online black market, Silk Road 2.0, quickly rose to take its place as the market leader.  These events were the product of Silk Road's long rise to prominence in the industry, as well as the lengthy investigation into its ringleader, the Dread Pirate Roberts.  To learn more about the entire history of Silk Road and its role in the bitcoin economy, revisit our full timeline here.

42425841,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgRTh,1403892033,"CoinDesk Mining Roundup: Dividend Coins, Viper Updates and a CloudHashing Giveaway","In the past two weeks several key companies in the bitcoin mining space have released updates regarding their latest ASIC developments. These announcements are no doubt welcome news to customers eagerly awaiting the next upgrades to their mines.  Academic interest in mining is also growing. New studies have come out dissecting various parts of the ecosystem, including an environmental report by researcher Hass McCook and one by security firm McAfee regarding the threat of mining botnets.  Indeed, these signs raise a key question: will industrial mining be the next big thing for bitcoin investors? If bitcoin’s rising difficulty is any indication – standing at 13,462,580,115 and primed to grow, according to BitcoinDifficulty.com – the next year could be a pivotal one for the mining industry.  So, as June winds to a close and many parts of the world – and a few mines – begin to heat up for the summer, let’s take a look at some of the latest happenings in the world of bitcoin mining.  Vault of Satoshi launches ‘divcoin’ mining  Toronto-based digital currency exchange Vault of Satoshi has launched a new revenue-generating feature to its cloud mining service called 'dividend coin', or divcoin.  Calling divcoin a “no-risk, no-obligation investment opportunity”, VoS is pitching the initiative as a new way to generate revenue in bitcoin. Each divcoin, according to the company, is worth 1 GH/s worth of mining. So, someone who owns 10 divcoins will receive daily payouts in bitcoin for the 10 GH/s of hashing power they control.  VoS is planning an initial launch phase of 5,000 divcoins. The company stated on its website that, should demand for divcoin increase, it will issue more, saying:  “As demand for divcoin rises, more coins will be available for purchase. To make this even more interesting, we will add the hardware before issuing more coins so that those currently invested will see an improved return for one to two days before we issue more coin.”  Additionally, VoS will host a divcoin market where traders and investors can buy and sell coins. While some may be concerned about the value of divcoin – considering the volatility inherent in any altcoin marketplace – the company said that all divcoin contracts will cease if mining becomes unprofitable.  Alpha Technology issues Viper update, unveils enclosure re-design  UK-based mining hardware manufacturer Alpha Technology has issued a new update on its upcoming Viper scrypt ASIC.  The company apologized for its infrequent updates to customers, but said that the development team is working hard in anticipation for the arrival of the Viper ASIC chips. Alpha originally announced that the ASIC tape-out had begun in April.  However, it said that the work is paying off, which the company said means that its customers will likely receive more powerful devices than previously expected.  Alpha stated on its official blog:  “In terms of the tweaks due to the increased hash rates: each board will now be 50Mh/s thus the 250Mh/s unit will have 5 boards and of course the 50Mh/s will have 1. 1.2Mh/s per chip was our original worst case figure but we now know each chip will be able to give 1.4Mh/s. A single one of our boards will have provision for 36 chips thus the boards will be slightly higher at a minimum of 50.4Mh/s possibly more we will know when we get the final chips and of course inform you.”  Additionally, the company said that it had reconfigured the Viper enclosure, and included schematics for the new design.  The company also stated that a more substantial update is pending, and issued a second apology to those who have been seeking contact with its payments team. Alpha added that it will begin contacting customers once it is able to begin processing payments, saying “we guarantee it will be before July”.  Bitmain announces specs for new 28nm chip  China-based bitcoin hardware maker Bitmain announced last week that it has begun testing its new 28nm chip, BM1382. According to a post on the Bitcoin Talk forum, the testing is going smoothly, with strong performance being reported during this phase.  The company said:  “BM1382 has achieved 15.75 Gh/s in hash performance, consuming less than 9.33 W on chip level at 0.75V. This means 0.59 J/GH on chip. If the core voltage is at 0.63V, the efficiency will be 0.40 J/GH on chip.”  The company added that this next generation of chips represents a substantial improvement over the previous serious, stating that “BM1382 represents a 20% power saving on its previous generation of 55nm chips and nearly 10 times of better physical densification”.  As well, Bitmain offered updated specs for the Antminer S3. It said that the mining hardware is capable of producing 504 GH/s, consuming roughly 390w. This, the company estimated, results in an efficiency rate of 0.77 J/GH.  Bitmain also announced that that sales for the Antminer S3 will open in the next few days on its official website, but stopped short of offering a set start date.  CloudHashing launches free contract giveaway  Cloud mining service CloudHashing is hoping to give one lucky Facebook user a free contract worth $999.  The company announced earlier today that it is holding a contest on its official Facebook page in order to drum up interest and support among users and potential customers. The contest runs through the next two weeks, with the winner being announced on 11th July, according to a press release.  In order to participate, users need to ‘like’ CloudHashing’s Facebook page. Additional entries can be gained by sharing the page with other users. The winner will be selected randomly by using a number generator, with each entry being assigned a number.  CloudHashing stated that there are no restrictions on applications, meaning that both new and existing customers are welcome to try and win the $999 mining contract. Facebook members who have already liked the page are being automatically entered into the contest, the company added.  BIOSTAR pitches new mining-ready motherboard  Since bitcoin mining took off in popularity in the past year and a half, computer hardware manufacturers of all stripes have sought to pick up some of the businesses the mining community has brought. This includes motherboard manufacturers, who are pitching their products to both bitcoin and altcoin miners.  Hardware maker BIOSTAR recently released its TB85 Ver. 6.x motherboard, which is geared for high-performance activity that includes specifically bitcoin mining. The motherboard sports a total of six PCI-E slots, making it a solid choice for those building their latest rig.  The TB85 carries support for the fourth-generation Intel Core i7 and i5 processors. The motherboard offers SATAIII 6 Gbps data transfer speeds, as well as range of security and performance-enhancing capabilities. Like many motherboards geared for bitcoin mining, the TB85 can also be purposed for high-performance gaming and graphics design work.  This motherboard isn’t BIOSTAR’s step into the bitcoin mining realm. In March, the company released a 64-chip mining board, the BTC-24GH, that released to some underwhelming reviews.  One reviewer, Hardwareluxx.com, said: “all in all, the only thing that’s left to say is that the BIOSTAR BTC-24GH unfortunately comes too late and is too slow.”  With the TB85 still fresh in the market, it remains to be seen whether BIOSTAR’s efforts to make inroads in the mining community will be successful.

Inside Bitcoins Hong Kong took place this week in the Special Administrative Region of China that has so far proved to be one of the more permissive places in Asia for bitcoin entrepreneurs.  Following the heavy media controversy generated by the ultimately successful Beijing-based Global Bitcoin Summit in May, Inside Bitcoins Hong Kong featured a number of influential speakers from China's bitcoin community, including Huobi CEO Leon Li, OKCoin CEO Star Xu and keynote speaker and BTC China CEO Bobby Lee.    Though smaller in scale than the Global Bitcoin Summit, Inside Bitcoins Hong Kong saw more international attendees than its predecessor and overall succeeded at increasing awareness of emerging China-based bitcoin companies with enthusiasts abroad.    Prominent international members of the community, including Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, Hive CEO Wendell Davis and BitAngels chairman Michael Terpin were also in attendance for panels covering topics such as bitcoin investment, the rise of altcoins and more.  The event itself produced big announcements from bitcoin ATM operator Bitcoinnect and bitcoin wallet specialist Hive, which introduced its web wallet during the event.  Despite these big names, the exhibition may have been the highlight as it connected exhibitors in a tight-knit environment that allowed for discussion between attendees and visitors.  Asia's bitcoin mining ecosystem may have seen the most success, however, as some attendees successfully secured equipment sales at the event.

42425824,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgQvh,1403884961,Singapore Government-Owned Investment Firm 'Experiments' With Bitcoin,"A triple-A rated investment company owned by the government of Singapore has been ""experimenting"" with bitcoin, according to a report in Today Online.  Temasek Holdings  has a $172bn portfolio and had a net income of $12.1bn in 2013. According to the news report, the firm launched its first office in New York City yesterday, throwing a lavish party and promising that it will ""seize opportunities in the entire American continent"".  The most surprising part of the launch came in Chairman Lim Boon Heng's speech, in which he said the company had recently conducted a company-wide ""bitcoin experiment"", with all staff at the company – over 400 people from drivers to board members – taking part.  The experiment involved everyone getting their own bitcoin wallet and practicing by using it to donate to charity, Mr. Lim said.  Cryptocurrency endorsement?  While Temasek itself has not announced any large-scale plans to invest in bitcoin businesses as yet, the staff experiment, and its high-profile mention by the chairman, is significant in that it tacitly endorses the technology.  Several elements within other large banks and financial institutions are known to be interested in cryptocurrency and keen to invest in bitcoin companies, but none have admitted it openly and most still balk at any mention of their name in the same sentence as 'bitcoin'.  About the company  As a government-owned investment firm, Temasek Holdings is hardly radical in its investment choices or behavior, although 'forward-looking' is part of its official charter and it invests heavily in areas like telecommunications and technology, industrials and life sciences. Its total portfolio covers almost the entire economic spectrum.  Temasek is often referred to as a 'sovereign wealth fund', but is never referred to as such by its government owner, despite being listed in Singapore's constitution. Described on its website simply as ""an investment company based in Singapore"", the 40-year-old company behaves more like a private firm, paying taxes and distributing dividends.  It is also one of the few companies in the world to have a corporate credit rating of AAA from Standard & Poor's and Aaa from Moody's, ratings it has held for 10 years.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/27/singapore-government-owned-investment-firm-experiments-with-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f07e14856e051cde24b9cfdc504373435d1b19a-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425825,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgR1h,1403881609,Controversial Italian Newspaper il Giornale Now Accepts Bitcoin,"Il Giornale, a conservative and sometimes controversial Italian newspaper serving the metropolitan area of Milan, has started accepting bitcoin for subscriptions to its premium PDF edition.  An annual subscription costs 42 euro cents per day and the PDF version is optimised for Android and iOS smartphones and tablets.  The paper already accepts all major credit cards and PayPal. It now claims to be the first newspaper in Italy and Europe to accept bitcoin.  Italian bitcoiners react  The community response to il Giornale’s decision to embrace bitcoin has been largely positive, but some political questions persist.  The paper was bought by Italian media mogul and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi in 1977. After Berlusconi decided to try his luck in politics, he sold the paper to his brother Paolo Berlusconi and veteran journalist Vittorio Feltri.  ""I heard that today on a national TV interview Paolo Berlusconi (yes, his brother), told that it will possible to buy his newspaper 'il Giornale' with bitcoin. It's basically an endorsement [of bitcoin],"" said bitcoin entrepreneur and Bitcoin Foundation member Davide Barbieri.  Coin Capital’s Sebastiano Scrofina shares the sentiment:  ""This is good news. Unfortunately, il Giornale is heavily politically sided, so this could stir up controversy and label bitcoin as a right-wing conservative thing.”  Scrofina hopes other newspapers will follow in il Giornale’s footsteps, just to balance things out from a political perspective.  No Chicago Sun-Times  The Chicago Sun-Times became the first major US newspaper to accept bitcoin in April 2014. However, the US publication is doing things a bit differently.  Like il Giornale it is selling standard subscriptions, but in addition to annual subscriptions it is also experimenting with micropayments. Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad has experimented with with bitcoin micropayments, too.  Selling standard subscriptions is just a part of the puzzle, but it is hardly innovative. Bitcoin enthusiasts have been advocating the use of bitcoin for micropayments in the content industry for a while.  The standard argument is that bitcoin would allow users access to cheap ‘à la carte content’ by making frictionless microtransactions viable. News junkies could simply choose to read a single report, or subscribe to a publication for a day or two without having to pay credit card fees.  Earlier this year, PriceWaterhouseCoopers examined the possibility of using bitcoin to buy and sell content and its findings were generally positive.  Of course, more work is needed to implement a simple, cheap and reliable micropayments system, but micropayments are already recognised as promising niche market for digital currencies.

Now Citi, the New York-based financial services giant, has made its opinions known too, examining the impact of the impending sale in a note sent out late yesterday penned by research analyst Steven Englander.  The bitcoins to be auctioned were seized by the US Marshals Service (USMS) following the shutdown of online drugs bazaar Silk Road. The USMS told CoinDesk that it is not certain whether it will issue information about the winning bidders for the funds.  However, a list of potential bidders was leaked last week, which included some big industry names, such as SecondMarket, Pantera Capital and Binary Financial.  Effect on price  According to the note, the firm's foreign exchange division, CitiFX, estimates that the auction will account for about 40% of the average daily volume of bitcoin transactions, and therefore is likely to have an impact on prices.  Furthermore, it says, the presence of big bidders is not the only problem facing small investors who were hoping to get in on the action:  ""Pumping such a large quantity into the market should weigh on prices. The terms of the auction make it difficult for small bidders ($200k deposit, each of the nine blocks valued around $1.8m), so the downward pressure is probably exacerbated by the limited number of investors interested in and capable of bidding.""  Citi also points out that the auction takes place between 6am and 6pm EDT, so any bidder will have to consider possible price fluctuations. Citi speculates, therefore, that ""ordinary buyers"" could choose to wait until the last possible moment to place their bid.  Furthermore, the note adds that the USMS is selling only about 20% of the total seized Silk Road bitcoin stash, so more auctions are likely to follow in the future.  Cautious prediction  Due to a number of factors and the belief that the upcoming auction has contributed to the 10% price drop since 11th June, Citi believes the bitcoin price will hit bottom during the auction:  ""Normally, we would expect the price to hit bottom around the time of the auction or soon after. Bitcoin isn’t that liquid so the sale will be hard to swallow. It is unlikely that anyone will bid above the market price – it would make more sense to just to buy in the market in bits and pieces and it’s not as if there is indication that there is bitcoin demand that is unmet because it is hard to buy lumpy amounts. There is simply little demand for lumpy amounts.""  The possibility of further auctions is also weighing on bitcoin's value, as many bidders anticipate the price pressure that these auctions are likely to exert. Citi believes this issue will cause ""more extended downward pressure"".  The document further questions the wisdom of putting the bitcoins up for sale in an auction, concluding that the auction structure is ""unnecessary and probably suboptimal"" due to the supply-demand imbalance it is likely to create.  ""The USMS could hire a couple of tech-savvy college kids to dribble its bitcoin holdings into the market, benefiting from the pseudonymity of bitcoin transactions. Selling bitcoin with its somewhat liquid market is not the same as auctioning off a 1998 Chevy with a couple of bullet holes in the driver’s door. The concentrated selling may lower prices more than needed, reducing the revenues collected,"" Citi argues.  No industry consensus  The auction has attracted a lot of media coverage and interest, but so far there is no clear consensus on what its impact on the market will be. While Citi expects prices to drop following the auction, some other analysts and industry leaders do not.  Gil Luria, who keeps track of bitcoin for Wedbush Securities, believes the auction should not have much of an impact in the long term. Similarly, CEO of Vaurum, Avish Bhama, expects a rally after the auction.  In any case, the elephant in the room is the rest of the stash, the remaining 144,000 bitcoins seized from Silk Road. It remains unclear when the government plans to auction them off, or whether it will decide to choose another model for the sale of these coins.

Although still relatively young, the Singaporean exchange has expanded rapidly. At the end of last year, itBit received $3.2m in venture capital, bringing its current funding total to $5.5m.  The Bloomberg Professional service has more than 320,000 subscribers and the decision will undoubtedly give the Asian exchange greater exposure worldwide.  Targeting professionals  ItBit describes itself as a bitcoin exchange for professionals, with reliable deposits and withdrawals, robust KYC and AML policies and good customer service. The Bloomberg deal will likely give it another credibility boost, too.  The exchange has been on a roll for weeks. It started offering generous incentives for bitcoin traders eager to switch exchanges in February and by June it had slashed prices and added a few new features, including an improved API.  The company has also attracted talent from the payments industry. In May its ranks were bolstered by a former senior manager at PayPal and an analyst from SecondMarket.  Bloomberg’s position hasn’t evolved much  Although Bloomberg started providing bitcoin prices through its professional service earlier this year, the financial services giant remains tight-lipped about the currency.  The move was viewed as a key stamp of approval for bitcoin, but Bloomberg took a very conservative, even cautious approach.  At the time Bloomberg emphasised that it was not endorsing or guaranteeing bitcoin, pointing out that the currency could be the biggest tech innovation since the internet, or just another crash-and-burn fad.  The company also added the Winklevoss’ bitcoin price ticker to its service earlier this month, under 'WINKBTCO'.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/27/bloomberg-terminals-now-track-bitcoin-data-from-itbit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4a43135a17a825498e62febdb5dfc2a2aebb6f0-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425821,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgNbh,1403864689,"Mark Karpeles: Mt. Gox Grew Too Fast, Too Quickly","CEO of Mt. Gox, Mark Karpeles, has finally broken his silence to tell the world how it feels to lose 850,000 bitcoins.  In an exclusive interview with the Wall Street Journal’s Tokyo reporters Takashi Mochizuki and Eleanor Warnock, Karpeles revealed he was ""scared, frustrated and angry"" in February when he realized the extent of the now-defunct exchange's losses, which total $499,027,945 at today's exchange rate.  The weakest point  He lamented that as the head of the company, it had been his mission to protect customers and employees, admitting that ""The weakest point of my company was management,"" for failing to lay out appropriate corporate structures or hire experienced executives.  Karpeles also admitted the company grew too fast for him to handle, something often suggested by both supporters and enemies alike.  Many of Mt. Gox's former customers and staff will no doubt be pleased to hear these confessions in the absence of any other compensation. Karpeles believes now that aside from the 200,000 BTC subsequently recovered, no further bitcoins will be found.  He does plan to auction off his domain name assets in one attempt to return some funds, including bitcoins.com and akb.com (a popular name in Japan thanks to pop group AKB48).  Then and now  Karpeles now lives alone with his cat in his upmarket apartment in the south-west of central Tokyo, where he still operates his web services company Tibanne.  Responding to accusations from angry creditors that his lifestyle choices remain extravagant, Karpeles said:  ""I swear I haven’t been doing anything too luxurious. Some people say I still own bitcoins or have a yacht, but that’s not true.""  The CEO added that he would like to attend Tokyo's weekly bitcoin meetup ""when things settle down"" to explain the course of events to users in his own words.  According to the WSJ report, he has also had many sleepless nights, always worried about the fate of Gox's bitcoins and apparently himself:  ""If anyone wants to start a bitcoin exchange, I would say, 'Be sure to have 24-hour security guards'.""  As well as the hacking attack that saw 850,000 BTC vanish, there had also been physical break-ins at the office and one former employee stands accused of stealing sensitive data.  Speaking of a rescue  Karpeles is still officially the CEO of Mt. Gox, though he no longer has any control over the company's remaining funds and a police investigation into what happened is ongoing.  There are at least two competing groups trying to take control of Mt. Gox with differing plans for reactivating the company and attempting to make creditors whole: Sunlot Holdings' SaveGox, and a team of Tokyo locals supported by Chinese exchange OKCoin.  Karpeles said he supported a rescue plan, but added that whatever customer funds remained should not be touched, ""Any buyers should use their own money to rehabilitate the exchange, not Mt. Gox’s.""  When asked if he regretted buying the exchange, the CEO mused, ""Half-yes. I learned a lot, but I lost a lot.""

42425803,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgNBh,1403837479,"DNA Block Chain Project Boosts Research, Preserves Patient Anonymity","Justin Zimmerman leads business development at Black & White Technologies (BWT), which works on merchant acceptance, remittance and smart contracts in the cryptocurrency space, and also consults on Japanese-Israeli market entry.  Israeli startup DNA.Bits has announced plans to store genetic and medical record data using block chain technology similar to that which underpins the bitcoin network.  The novel concept will make the genetic information fully accessible to the researchers who need it, while using strong private keys to maintain digital DNA-wallet privacy and individual anonymity.  Dror Sam Brama, DNA.Bits’ CEO, is a local leader in a global revolution to give medical patients an unprecedented level of privacy, access and control over their personal medical records and genetic data – while simultaneously making the genetic data of the human race accessible to all.  Hospitals will still be able to monetize that patient data, meaning healthcare systems will be better equipped to heal patients, and by receiving access to such data, pharmaceutical companies will be able to produce superior drugs.  Monetizing the data  Patient data would live on a 'side chain', and when there is a need for a monetary transaction, it would move onto the 'main' (ie: bitcoin) blockchain.  Possible revenue streams for DNA.Bits would be licensing of the platform to data hosts, or a percentage of the contracts that run on the platform. There could also be market-maker revenues from the connections between holders of medical data, holders of genetic data, health organizations and consumers.  Brama sees the company's potential customers as the holders of those records and anyone conducting research, whether they be genetics companies, pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions or government public health departments.  The global pharmaceutical market is now worth $1tn. In the US, close to 20% of drugs are bioengineered products and, every year, the specialized genetic medicine market grows by 18%.  Game changer  The pharmaceutical industry, in addition, is enormously hungry for patient genetic and medical-record data. DNA.Bits is building a system to funnel that data to the researchers who need it, but in a way that prevents patient privacy rights from being trampled.  Smadar Horowitz-Cederboim from The Jerusalem Center for Genetics and Society (JCGAS), said:  ""The ability to cross reference large sets of dynamic medical and genetic records anonymously is a game changer in the fields of drug discovery, personalized medicine and genetic counseling.""  Saving lives  Dr. Efrat Levy-Lahad from the Shaare Zedek Genetics Institute said, in Israel, approximately 1,000 women die from breast cancer every year, for example. With a nationwide DNA screening and analysis programme, experts at Jerusalem's Department of Medical Genetics at Shaare Zedek Medical Center estimate that up to 200 lives could be saved annually.  What holds true for breast cancer in Israel is also applicable to countless other diseases across the world. The main stumbling block for such programmes, though, is the question of privacy.  Patients, of course, have no reason to trust governmental agencies, hospitals, insurance companies, healthcare companies, pharmaceutical firms, or even non-profits with their private data.  The beauty of block chain technology is that it enables the building of 'trustless systems' that remove the need for patients to put their faith in institutions or individuals.  Innovating around the block chain  Israel is probably the perfect place for a project like DNA.Bits to get off the ground. The country is often regarded as one of the most innovative on the planet. This is true for technology in general, but these days it is also being applied to the nascent field of block chain technology.  It's not just about novel digital currencies, either – Israel was one of the first communities to lead the surge into use of the block chain for non-currency focused activity.  So far Israel has given the world the mastercoin protocol, the colored coins project, Xennet, Lazooz, along with some academic innovation for online privacy, such as ZeroCash, Ghost, and Snark.  Elsewhere, other companies are also employing block chain tech outside of the world of finance.  CoinDesk recently reported on how Proof of Existence is allowing content providers to publish their work on a block chain to protect their intellectual property rights. Even digital democracy could be revolutionised by using an altcoin called votecoin to hash and verify votes.
