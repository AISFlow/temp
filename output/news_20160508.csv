42399032,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1YZ,1462725099,Building a Better Bitcoin Fee Market,"Over the past year we have seen the fee market for bitcoin transactions evolve at a rapid pace. As transaction volume continues to increase, so does the demand for block space, which remains in limited supply of 1 megabyte (MB) approximately every 10 minutes.  Since we have debated the issue of increasing the supply of block space ad nauseum, this article will focus on the history and current state of bitcoin transaction fees.  The fact is that the pressures resulting from high contention for block space have degraded user experience and thus incentivized bitcoin wallets to make adjustments in order to keep their users happy by ensuring timely confirmation of transactions.  However, we're a long way from operating an optimal fee market.  The History of Transaction Fees  For the first several years of bitcoin’s existence, transaction fees were optional – they were considered a donation to miners.  Wallets paid the same fee on every transaction – defaulting to whatever fee the wallet developer thought was appropriate.  Bitcoin Core  's default fee changed several times over the years as the bitcoin exchange rate increased, from 0.01 BTC to 0.0005 BTC to 0.0001 BTC. There were also rules around ""priority transactions"" that enabled users to send transactions with no fee if the inputs were old and high value enough, though miners have mostly phased those out at this point.  We learned over the years that hard-coded static transaction fees are terrible for several reasons:  It's not the absolute fee that matters to miners, but rather the fee rate per bytes of transaction data. From the miner’s perspective, they only have 1 MB of space into which they want to insert as many transactions as possible in order to collect more fees. As such, a 200 byte transaction with a fee of 0.0001 BTC is preferable to a 1,000 byte transaction with a fee of 0.0001 BTC, because they can insert five of the former and collect five times as much in fees.  From the user’s perspective, if you always set a static fee, you’ll likely eventually create a large data size transaction (due to spending many low value inputs) with a very low fee rate that may never get confirmed.  Wallets with static fees can't adapt to quickly changing market conditions, resulting in users broadcasting transactions that are either overpaying or underpaying. The former won't get transactions confirmed much faster, while the latter will result in long confirmation times because miners pass them over in favor of more profitable transactions to confirm.  The release of Bitcoin 0.3.15 in November 2010 included a change to start calculating fees relative to the transaction’s data size, but not every wallet software followed suit and many users continued blindly setting the same static fee on every transaction. This was generally not a problem until we started bumping up against the max block size, because miners would confirm pretty much any valid transaction that was successfully relayed to them.  As blocks began to fill up in 2015, it became clear that the best practice is to use a dynamic fee algorithm because it can respond to changing conditions on the network.  Bitcoin Core started calculating dynamic fee estimates as of the 0.10 release in February 2015, and Alex Morcos has been steadily improving them since then. Core's fee estimate algorithm is rather complex; you can view its code here and the english explanation here.  A Fee Market Emerges  Antoine Le Calvez, developer of p2sh.info, provides a historical analysis of dynamic and static fees.  Here are the past two years:  We can see significant jumps in dynamic fee usage during the network stress tests and attacks last fall.  However, I suspect that this was not due to normal users switching to dynamic fee wallets, but rather the attackers themselves paying fees that they intentionally set to be higher than the static fees being used by most wallets at the time.  Some of the more sophisticated users adjusted their hard-coded fees during the attacks, but these were likely a small minority of the total transactions. We can also see a jump at the beginning of March 2016 – this is likely partially a result of Blockchain's new wallet deploying dynamic fees about a month earlier.  Rusty Russell performed an excellent analysis of the emerging fee market in December 2015, which showed that more transactions are using dynamically calculated fees, and that the average value of a transaction is increasing as tiny payments are getting priced out of the blockchain.  AJ Towns followed up on Rusty’s post with more in-depth analysis. He identified eight distinct fee market phases over the course of bitcoin’s history:  Towns continued his investigation in a second post and came to several conclusions about the effects that the emerging fee market has had upon users.  These were:  A significant number of wallets are dynamically calculating fees, at a per-byte granularity.  Many wallets still don’t calculate fees dynamically, or even calculate fees at a per-byte level.  Market-driven fees will only be able to rise further with increased adoption of wallets that support dynamic fee estimates.  Significantly overpaying the market rate will not get your transaction confirmed any quicker.  There have been two fee events that have impacted wallets with static fees, and a third fee event is coming soon.  Wallets that dynamically calculate fees pay substantially lower fees on average than those that don’t.  I've been tracking Bitcoin Core's fee estimates with Statoshi; here you can see that they have tripled over the past six months as contention for block space continues to increase.  Calvez also provides a dashboard with all of the publicly available fee estimate APIs and their historical estimate data:  Interestingly, it appears that 21, BitGo, and Blocktrail’s fee estimates appear to be the most responsive to changing market conditions while BitPay, Blockchain, and BlockCypher have less volatile estimates.  However, it would be negligent for me to broadly recommend everyone switch to using dynamically calculated transaction fees without first noting the dangers involved.  As the saying goes, every solution leads to new problems. Dynamic transaction fees are no exception.  Dynamic Difficulties  Dynamic fee estimates will never be perfect because they are an attempt to predict the (near) future.  As Danish physicist Niels Bohr once quipped: ""prediction is very difficult, especially about the future"". If a fee estimate algorithm fails to correctly predict the future state of the fee market then users get stuck in a ""fee trap"" as noted by Dr Washington Sanchez of OpenBazaar.  This can occur if you broadcast a transaction with a perfectly reasonable fee for the current market conditions, but immediately after doing so, many other higher fee transactions get broadcasted by other users, which essentially push your transaction to the back of miners’ priority queue. The problem is that you can't, without Replace By Fee (RBF), update your ""bid"" in order to compensate for the new market conditions.  Bugs in fee estimate algorithms also have potential to wreak havoc on the fee market. Take, for example, a recent user error that resulted in someone creating a transaction with a whopping 300 BTC fee. This was bad enough for the unfortunate user who likely fat-fingered the ""fee"" and ""value"" amounts into some poorly coded software, but it also had ripple effects:  [embed]https://twitter.com/khannib/status/725090752531959808[/embed]  This is an educated guess, but it appears that BlockCypher’s ""1 to 2 block target"" is using a fee estimate algorithm based upon a weighted moving average of fees from the past two days of blocks. As a result, when the 300 BTC fee transaction was mined, the recent fee average and thus their estimate spiked by 800%.  But this is not meant to pick on BlockCypher, as we have seen many wallets have issues with transaction fees. Not even Bitcoin Core is exempt, as I recently observed an unexpected spike in the fee estimates from Bitcoin Core 0.12.0:  I noticed that Statoshi.info’s ""two block target"" fee estimate surged from 44 to 112 satoshis per byte on 27th February for no apparent reason. My other bitcoin nodes did not report the same spike.  This could perhaps be explained by differences in mempool transactions since Core’s fee estimate algorithm only uses fees from transactions that were first received as unconfirmed.  It is concerning and is a demonstration of a downside to extrapolating the future based upon your node’s view of the network, which is not guaranteed to be the same as everyone else's.  Macro meltdown  While there are plenty of challenges presented to bitcoin developers on a per-transaction basis, we should also be cognizant of the effects upon the fee market as a whole.  I'm concerned by a couple potential scenarios that could drive fee rates up faster than necessary:  Poorly coded dynamic fee algorithms could create a feedback loop that drives the fee rate up with no ceiling as transactions continue to flood the network with no regard for the mempool backlog. This is not a huge concern if most transactions are being initiated by humans who are then seeing a fee displayed and deciding whether or not it is too high for their tastes. However, if many transactions are being created automatically without any human decision making and the algorithms creating them don’t have any sanity checks on the maximum fee paid, the market could run away until the engineers who wrote those algorithms notice and make changes to them.  Frustrated users (or lazy developers) who are still relying upon hard-coded fees may keep manually updating their wallet settings until their transactions start getting confirmed, likely overpaying significantly, but eventually forcing other static fee users to do the same in order to remain competitive. Dynamic fee users will be pulled upwards as a result. I've already observed the former happening, though not yet to the extent that it has affected dynamic fees significantly.  [embed]https://twitter.com/lopp/status/713095965155192832[/embed]  One recent development that hasn’t received much attention despite the fact that it has the potential to affect the fee market is the development of secondary miner fee markets.  This can take the form of special customer incentive programs such as BTCC’s BlockPriority service or it can take the form of private prepaid block space purchases. This spells trouble for any developers who are writing fee estimate algorithms because now there are opaque fee markets that are invisible to the rest of the world.  To quote BTCC’s press release:  ""BlockPriority prioritizes all BTCC’s customers’ transactions, including those who pay zero transaction fees.""  This should not be a problem for Bitcoin Core’s fee estimate algorithm because it requires 95% of mempool transactions with a given fee rate to be confirmed in X blocks after being seen, but it could affect more naive algorithms. The lesson for developers is that just because you are seeing transactions at a low fee rate of X being confirmed no longer means that it’s safe for your service to broadcast transactions at that fee rate.  It may make economic sense for mining pools to sell prepaid block space contracts because it gives them a new predictable revenue stream.  However, my warning to pools is this: you won’t be able to hide this activity if it becomes a significant portion of your mined transactions. There are plenty of wallet engineers such as myself who are monitoring for this type of behavior, and if it becomes a problem, we will go public. I suspect that any public mining pools found to be participating in this behavior will not fare so well if the individual hashers discover that the pool has been mining lower fee transactions and not sharing the profits from the private block space contracts.  This could result in hashers moving to a pool that they think will be more profitable.  Segregated Witness will also likely have an effect upon the fee market. It will offer a 75% fee discount in an attempt to rebalance the costs of creating versus consuming unspent transaction outputs.  This is expected to encourage users to favor the use of transactions that minimize impact on the UTXO set in order to minimize fees and to encourage developers to design smart contracts and new features in a way that will also minimize the impact on the UTXO set.  David Harding wrote up a helpful breakdown of the data savings provided by SegWit.  [embed]https://twitter.com/lopp/status/705122188106604546[/embed]  I think this is the right path to take, though I’m not sure that 75% is the optimal number. It seems to me that the most fair discount would be dynamic and based upon the ratio of the output’s data size to the corresponding data size of the same output when it is spent as an input.  Though this would certainly be much more difficult to implement, if it’s even possible at all.  Moving forward  There are still many wallets and bitcoin services that have not implemented dynamic fees. You know who you are, and your inaction is likely resulting in a poor experience for some of your users. If you haven’t implemented dynamic fees, then every transaction you broadcast fits into one of two categories:  You're overpaying the market rate and not getting confirmed significantly faster.  You're underpaying and transactions are getting stuck, resulting in a poor user experience.  It's highly unlikely that a transaction broadcast with a hard-coded fee is hitting the sweet spot and paying the optimal rate to match current market conditions.  Wallet developers should add safety mechanisms such as sanity check thresholds at the micro level and circuit breakers at the macro level to prevent users from shooting themselves in the foot.  Wallets should set a minimum threshold that is higher than just the minimum relay fee. By observing the minimum fee transactions that make it into blocks, we can clearly see that as of today if you’re paying under five satoshis per byte, you’re going to have a bad time.  Wallet developers should think adversarially about their fee estimate algorithms and write them to be robust against edge cases that could occur due to mistakes in other wallet software or malicious attacks by entities trying to manipulate the fee market. They should also monitor their fee estimate data and set alerts to notify them if the estimates become more volatile than expected.  But, we should recognize that there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" fee estimate algorithm – it really depends upon the use case your bitcoin transactions fall under.  Bitcoin Core's algorithm aims to be as generic and conservative as possible so that it's incredibly reliable, but for some use cases it may result in overpaying. Each wallet and service will need to decide what trade off they are willing to make to balance the risk of delayed confirmations against the reward of saving money on fees.  As such, I encourage all bitcoin wallets to make their fee estimates accessible via public APIs. I suspect that the fee estimate algorithms themselves will become a point of competition and often remain closed source, but it the estimates are public then we can more easily watch for abnormal activity. Perhaps someone will even build a ""Bitcoin Average"" aggregator for fee estimates!  We should recognize that the ""fee market"" isn’t exactly a market in the traditional sense of the word.  Users can place a ""bid"" by broadcasting a transaction, but miners don’t publicize their ""asks"" – wallets have to guess based upon the transactions miners have recently confirmed and by what transactions are currently waiting to be confirmed.  Konrad S Graf stated his thoughts on the ""fee market"" recently:  ""Fees are paid; products and services are bought. So, this term already obscures the real product. Users submit transactions with a fee as an open bid in hopes of confirmation. I describe this as a market for transaction-inclusion services. Users bid to have miners include transactions in candidate blocks. Inclusion in more candidate blocks—especially in relation to the total hashrate mining for those candidates – raises odds of quicker confirmation. Users prefer quicker confirmation to slower, other things equal, so the time element of scarcity is key. It is a market for confirmation priority, a time market.""  Perhaps if mining pools published public APIs with their mining policies and ""going rates"", then it could help wallet services make more informed decisions when calculating dynamic fees rather than forcing developers to rely upon guesswork. This could also help alleviate problems caused by miners who create opaque secondary fee markets via private block space contracts.  Bitcoin users should not need to keep track of the current state of block contention.  Wallets should be handling the complexities of the fee market under the covers, giving the user several simple options when sending a transaction. One potential route would be for the user to authorize a max fee depending upon the transaction urgency and have the wallet use RBF to ramp up the fee paid after each block that passes without it being confirmed.  Transaction fee values should be displayed to the user in terms of their preferred unit of account, such as dollars. It would probably also make sense to display the fee in terms of a percentage of the transaction's value if it exceeds a certain threshold, such as 1%. This will make it easier for users to decide if the current state of the fee market is too contentious and that they would prefer to delay making the transaction until they can safely do so at a lower fee rate.  When we are discussing transaction fees, bitcoin users should stop saying that they paid ""X cents"" or ""Y bits"" in transaction fees because this type of statement is nonsensical without knowing the size of the transaction. We should standardize using fee rates in discussions, preferably denominated in terms of satoshis per byte. It’s simpler for humans to write and keep track of ""20 satoshis per byte"" in comparison to ""20,000 satoshis per kilobyte"".  The evolution of bitcoin's transaction fee market has been a rocky road up to this point.  At first fees were set manually by developers, then manually by users, and now we're at a more chaotic and potentially dangerous point where developers are playing a more active role in steering the economics of this emerging market.  Kristov Atlas eloquently noted the risks we take by centrally planning economic changes to bitcoin without fully studying them; developers should keep this in mind when writing fee estimate algorithms. We should strive to ensure that the fee market remains driven by humans with the aid of machines, not the other way around. Wallet developers must be careful when building their fee logic so that we can provide a smooth user experience without taking away users' freedom of choice, which is necessary for maintaining a functioning fee market.

42399027,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Sf,1462716761,What Investors Should Know Before Trading Ether,"Given the increasing prominence of the idea blockchain tech will impact enterprise business, both retail investors and investment institutions are optimistic the market could soon develop into a vibrant new asset class.  However, to date, there have been few alternative digital assets that have offered a value proposition that differs from that of bitcoin, the oldest publicly traded blockchain-based cryptocurrency.  Today, bitcoin appeals to investors with both a high tolerance for risk and those who believe the digital currency could one day become a stable store of value and financial rail competitive in global commerce. Though often cited as volatile, bitcoin’s market remains one of the more stable among digital currencies, with a market cap today in excess of $7bn at press time.  Many alternative digital currencies, in turn, have offered a similar value proposition, and comparably more pronounced volatility.  Amid this landscape, ether, a currency transacted through the Ethereum platform, is perhaps emerging as a contender for more adventurous portfolios. Despite a recent slump in price, ether volume has seen strong growth as more global exchanges add the asset to their offerings.  Ether provides unique benefits not offered by alternative digital currencies, including bitcoin, but it also comes with its own set of risks and considerations. Interested investors can benefit from learning the basics of ethereum, as well as the key variables that influence ether’s price movements.  What is Ethereum?  A platform for decentralized applications, Ethereum was invented by Vitalik Buterin and announced in early 2014. At the time, Buterin indicated in public appearances he was keen to create an alternative blockchain-based system that would offer a superior arsenal of tools to global developers.  Launching in beta in July 2015 and in a production version this March, Ethereum’s big innovation is that it runs Turing-complete smart contracts, applications that rely on if-then scenarios to execute specific terms of an agreement.  Basically, smart contracts ensure that once a predetermined condition is met, the corresponding clause contained in the contract is fulfilled, and the Turing-complete factor has been heralded as allowing developers a new expressiveness in writing such code.  Today, smart contracts can run on the public Ethereum blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that is used to keep track of all related transactions and agreements.  The smart contracts that run on its blockchain could have widespread applications, as developers could use them to create markets, execute transactions based on agreements created long ago and keep track of pledges made by different counterparties.  Many users have already begun taking advantage of these myriad options, developing a wide range of apps that can be used to set up ridesharing applications, sports bets and even investment schemes, The New York Times has reported.  But as open-source technology, corporations are free to create their own private blockchains based on Ethereum that do not use the public Ethereum blockchain, and as such, don’t use Ethereum’s token, ether.  How ether's market works  Unlike bitcoin, ether is not designed to function as a global digital currency. Instead, it is meant to pay for specific actions on the Ethereum network, with users receiving it for using their computing power to validate transactions and for contributing to its development  However, ether’s market is currently supported by many of the same exchanges and infrastructure that has built up around the bitcoin network. For example, users who have historically bought bitcoin and other digital currencies on venture-backed exchange platforms such as Bitfinex and Kraken can today buy ether on these websites.  But, ether’s market did not develop in the same manner as bitcoin’s market.  In bitcoin, users were once able to process transactions on the network using a home computer, and then eventually, home mining equipment. Bitcoin grew in value as the number of participants in the network expanded. Ethereum arguably developed under different circumstances.  In a bid to galvanize a global development community around its idea, Ethereum launched a pre-sale of ether tokens in 2014, raising more than $14m in what has been called a crowdfunding effort, but bears resemblance to a kind of informal initial public offering (IPO).  Donations collected for this sale were the driving factor behind the initial supply and the rate of issuance that existed after. As a result of this event, contributors of the presale received 60m ether. Another 12m went to the development fund, with the majority of this amount going to early developers and contributors. The Swizterland-based non-profit Ethereum Foundation received the remainder of this amount.  These numbers added up to an initial ether supply of 72m ETH. Following this event, Ethereum’s protocol permitted the creation of 5 ETH for every block mined. In addition, a maximum of 18m ETH were allowed to come into existence every year following this event.  In the bitcoin network, the supply rate is more consistent. Due to hard-coded rules in the software there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins (unless the rules are changed), and the rate at which new tokens are introduced is 25 BTC roughly every 10 minutes today.  Investors should note that such consistency is not guaranteed in the ether market.  The Ethereum Foundation announced at the time of launch that ether’s rules would soon change, and that starting some time in 2017, the network would follow the rules of Casper, a consensus algorithm still being developed.  As of mid-April, the total number of ether transactions stood at 3.3 million, resulting in an ether supply of 79m ETH, Etherscan figures reveal.  In addition, ether was trading at 0.0197 BTC, or about $9.25.  How does mining affect price?  As stated above, one of the biggest factors on bitcoin’s price is the steady introduction of new bitcoins through payments to the computer operators that process transactions (miners).  Mining affects price by increasing the supply, and through the decision of miners to hold or sell bitcoin. Ethereum’s current version, Homestead, leverages a proof-of-work based consensus algorithm, rewarding computers that contribute to its security in the same way.  Under this system, miners create a new block every 15-17 seconds, resulting in the creation of 5 ETH, according to figures provided by Ethereum.org. Miners that contribute to discovering a solution, but don’t get their block included, can receive two or three new ethers, which is called an uncle/aunt reward.  Once Ethereum starts using Casper, a proof-of-stake protocol, this rate is expected to change, as many anticipate Casper will provide a smaller mining subsidy. Under the new protocol, nodes will not be able to validate transactions and therefore produce blocks unless they provide a security deposit.  Should the protocol determine that a node, or ""bonded validator,"" has produced anything invalid, the node will lose both any deposit provided and also the ability to participate in the consensus process. Currently, bonded validators face no penalty if they produce blocks considered invalid by the protocol.  By changing incentives, it is expected that Casper will be more efficient, but the change could also mean that ether’s value is adjusted to the new realities of the network’s operation.  Security questions  With seven years of development (and few major issues), the bitcoin network is often heralded by supporters as the most secure blockchain. Even enterprise businesses have expressed a value in its strong network effects and diverse mining network.  Ethereum has faced criticism for potential security problems for several reasons, though most center on the fact that the software is in its early stages and has only been available for a few years. The network has suffered fewer attacks than bitcoin, and as a result it has undergone less testing than its older digital currency.  The differing compositions of ether and bitcoin’s mining pools are also worth noting. While bitcoin’s mining community has sometimes drawn criticism for being dominated by a small number of players, this situation seems replicated in Ethereum.  While Blockchain.info figures show five companies control about 81% of bitcoin’s hashrate distribution, five companies accounted for more than 85% of ether’s hashrate distribution by mid-April.  Further, though the largest bitcoin miner (F2Pool) accounted for 26% of the digital currency’s hashrate distribution in this 24-hour block, the biggest ether miner (dwarfpool) supplied 41.8% of this currency’s hashrate.  Going forward, developers continue to work on newer versions of Ethereum, but critics have predicted that ether will face greater security problems than bitcoin. There is only one way to find out.  Price volatility  Because of the infancy of the platform, Ether has experienced sharp price fluctuations. At the time of report, the digital currency had logged one-day, one-month and since-inception changes of 31%, 16.7% and 53.7%, respectively.  While this volatility might make the currency look less valid in the eyes of some, these gyrations provide opportunities for traders.  Market participants can buy and sell ethereum using both fiat currency and bitcoin. Such transactions are available through numerous exchanges, as several organizations have started offering these trades in recent years.  Because of the digital currency’s sharp volatility, some traders speculate on its future price movements in an attempt to turn a profit. Others use ether to hedge bitcoin, as well as alternative digital currencies.  Charles L.
