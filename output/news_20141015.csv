42377706,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73BGJ,1413409318,Court Delays Ross Ulbricht Silk Road Trial Until January 2015,"The case against alleged Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht has been delayed until next year.  Wired reporter Andy Greenberg first reported on Twitter that Ulbricht’s defense counsel had sought to postpone the start of trial, which was scheduled to begin on 10th November. US District Judge Katherine Forrest then adjourned the trial until early January.  Ulbricht has pled not guilty to charges of drug trafficking, money laundering, hacking and criminal enterprise, and in August pled not guilty to additional drug and conspiracy charges.  The prosecution is arguing that Ross Ulbricht is the mastermind of the now-defunct Silk Road marketplace, but friends, family and supporters say that Ulbricht is the target of an unfair legal inquisition.  Ulbricht defense counsel Joshua Dratel said that his team sought the delay in order to resolve several scheduling issues.  He told CoinDesk:  “The court did not provide its reasons for the adjournment, but we asked for it earlier this week based on a couple of factors: the danger that the trial would run into the Christmas holidays, which would affect juror availability and the continuity of the trial; some technical and logistical delays (owing to the limitations inherent in Mr. Ulbricht's pretrial confinement) in getting Mr Ulbricht access to some discovery; some other scheduling issues.”  The move gives the Ulbricht team more time to pore over the prosecution’s case, which includes terabytes of server data that the defense says was unlawfully procured by federal authorities.  Trial to go on  The adjournment until January is notable, given prior attempts by the defense to have the case dismissed outright by the court. In July, Judge Forrest rejected a motion to dismiss filed by the Ulbricht team, which at the time contested a money laundering charge.  Earlier this week, the defense suffered a key loss when it tried to contest evidence obtained from Silk Road servers hosted in Iceland. Ulbricht’s team argued that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) violated the Fourth Amendment by illegally seizing the servers.  According to court documents (hat tip to newsBTC and Andy Greenberg), Judge Forrest rejected the motion because Ulbricht never claimed ownership over the servers in question. Therefore, she said, his assertion that those servers were private property was invalid.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2014/10/15/court-delays-ross-ulbricht-silk-road-trial-until-january-2015,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78135d3fb21b523976806e9b032dee36d9d56ba8-1654x859.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377709,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73BLL,1413407440,California Attorney Investigating Potential Class Action Against KnCMiner,"UPDATE (16th October 12:43 BST): New background information about Butterfly Labs and Alpha Technologies has been added to this article.      A potential class action against bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner is beginning to take shape.  California-based attorney Charlotte C Lin has announced that her firm is investigating unlawful activities related to the sale and distribution of KnCMiner's Titan and Neptune mining products. These include breach of contract, false advertisement and public misrepresentation, which were detailed on the initiative's official website.  KnCMiner, which raised $14m in Series A funding last month, has faced complaints from customers regarding late shipments, defective hardware and other business practices in the past.  Lin’s firm specializes in areas of personal law such as employment and immigration, and in recent months has become more directly involved in the digital currency industry. Her law firm also accepts payments in bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin.  Lin released a press statement to CoinDesk saying that the move stemmed from what she characterized as a growing chorus of dissatisfied miners.  She explained:  “I myself have a lot of colleagues and friends who are actively engaged in mining, trading cryptocurrencies, or own mining equipment. I have heard many complaints from them about not getting refunds back, equipment not working, or under-delivering hashing power.”  Her office added that it is still determining what, if any, damages will be sought as a result of the possible class action.  Notably, Lin appeared recently at the Hashers United conference in Las Vegas where miners discussed the potential suit and, in some cases, pledged their support to the effort.  KnCMiner responds  KnCMiner director of marketing and public relations Nanok Bie confirmed with CoinDesk that the company is aware of the potential class suit taking shape.  Bie stated that the bitcoin mining industry, and the ecosystem as a whole, is “a high-pressure business with a lot of strong feelings”, but argued that the class action being explored by Lin’s office will not succeed.  “There is no basis for legal action,” Bie said, later adding, ""There's a lot of these things happening in the business. We are, on the contrary, a transparent and honest company. We show journalists around our facilities, and our final accounts are public.""  For now, no actual legal measures have been taken, and as Lin’s office noted in its press statement, it is reaching out to customers and building out its case. Though short on specifics, the statement said that more updates on its case against KnCMiner are pending on the potential suit’s official website.  Industry complaints    In a highly-competitive industry prone to design issues, missed deadlines and squeezed margins, customer complaints are common.      Alpha Technology, a rival scrypt mining outfit based in the UK, has attracted criticism from consumers for its conditional refunds policy, though plans for a civil action have fallen through. Managing director Mohammed Akram has denied any wrongdoing, stating: “This refund policy is fair as we are not taking 100% [of customer deposits] upfront.”      One of the oldest hardware companies in the space, Butterfly Labs, is currently battling to resume full business operations following an enforced shutdown by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) last month.      The FTC said it received nearly 300 customer complaints against the company, again related to refunds, shipping delays and false advertising. Butterfly Labs, which is now overseen by a court-appointed receiver, responded that it intends to address “a number of unsubstantiated claims” in due course.

42377704,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73BF3,1413376881,Lawsky: Bitcoin Developers and Miners Exempt from BitLicense,"Developers, miners and individuals using bitcoin will generally not be regulated by the impending 'BitLicense' proposals, according to Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  Speaking at the Benjamin N Cardozo School of Law, New York, Lawsky clarified that many individuals and companies working within the bitcoin space will not need regulatory approval or a BitLicense to operate in New York State.  ""We are regulating financial intermediaries. We are not regulating software development,"" he said, adding:  ""To clarify, we do not intend to regulate software or software development. For example, a software developer who creates and provides wallet software to customers for their own use will not need a license. Those who are innovating and developing the latest platforms for digital currencies will not need a license.""  However, Lawsky stressed that companies involved in safeguarding customers' money will not be exempt. ""We do not, for example, let someone run a bank out of their garage,"" he said.  Banking and tech 'collide'  According to Lawsky, the banking industry and the tech industry are starting to ""collide"" and create new challenges for regulators.  The NYDFS was forced to operated with money transmitter regulations drafted at a time when there was no Internet or cryptocurrencies, he said, explaining that the department has an obligation to license and regulate such companies.  On a positive note, Lawsky said the NYDFS quickly recognised the potential of block-chain technology:  ""As we began looking at bitcoin last year and getting deeper into it, we began to see the power of the technology that underlies it.""  The technology has the potential to provide cheaper fees and remittances, he said.  New York residents who send money abroad usually pay fees of 8-9%, while digital currencies could operate with fees of about 1%, Lawsky pointed out. Digital currencies do not require people to disclose their credit card information and offer faster transactions, he added.  Lawsky clarifies provisions  The NYDFS started working on the first controversial BitLicense drafts following the fall of Mt Gox, earlier this year, said Lawsky.  The comment period for the original proposal was extended following requests from industry leaders. The revised proposal will take those comments into account and, once published, a new comment period for the revised regulation will begin.  He made it clear that the NYDFS does not intend to request more than once license for digital currency businesses and, in most cases, they will not have to obtain money transmitter licenses. Like developers, individual bitcoin users will not be affected by the regulation.  Lawsky went on to dismiss a number of criticisms of the original proposal as unsubstantiated, saying they were the result of misunderstandings.  One complaint alleged that banks would not have to comply with the new regulatory framework, but that is only true if banks do not choose do deal in digital currencies, he explained.  Regulation with benefits  Lawsky also addressed speculation regarding the department's position on bitcoin mining:  ""Mining per se will not be regulated. To the extent the miner engages in other virtual currency activities, however – for example, hosting wallets or exchanging virtual currency – a license may be required for those activities. For mining itself, there will be no license requirement.""  The NYDFS will also try to keep compliance costs down, he said, thus allowing startups to thrive.  In his speech, Lawsky conceded that some companies may choose to operate from unregulated jurisdictions to avoid the state's regulatory requirements, but if they chose to do so, such companies may end up sacrificing competitiveness.  He explained:  ""Our hope is that companies recognize, or at least some of them do, that appropriate, effective regulation will help create a race, not to the bottom, but to the top; that it will foster greater confidence and trust from both customers and investors who want to do businesses committed to customer protection. That will spur a cycle of greater adoption of virtual currencies.""  It is possible to innovate, play by the rules and make a profit at the same time, he concluded.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/15/lawsky-bitcoin-developers-and-miners-exempt-from-bitlicense,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c821bc15829036da881d7d6beff1f497a58d9d9-2560x1959.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377728,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73BMb,1413370005,How Bitcoin's Block Chain Could Stop History Being Rewritten,"Despite the recent drop in bitcoin's price, cryptocurrency startups are now attracting more investment than ever and stories about major developments in the bitcoin ecosystem are being picked up by mainstream media on a regular basis.  The New York Times reported the news that popular bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain had raised $30.5m in financing. Last week, Time published an article titled How Bitcoin Can Save Journalism and the Arts, exploring bitcoin’s micropayment capability for creating a new model of content distribution that is free from advertising.  Yet, long before this new interest and innovation sparked outside the tech community, WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange was seeing the promise of the bitcoin technology beyond currency.  The confluence of this stateless digital currency and the iconic whistle-blowing site first emerged when WikiLeaks faced a financial blockade by Bank of America, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union, which reportedly blocked 95% of their revenue.  Bitcoin was used to circumvent the banking blockade. Here the advocates for the free flow of decentralized currency joined the fight for free speech.  The WikiLeaks-bitcoin alliance  In his conversation with Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt documented in his new book When Google Met WikiLeaks, Assange described bitcoin as “something that evolved out of the cypherpunks” and explained in detail the underpinning technology that made it possible for WikiLeaks to counteract the state’s economic censorship.  However, it seems this is just the tip of the iceberg of the WikiLeaks-bitcoin alliance and the revolutionary potential hidden within the encryption-based network. The ramifications of bitcoin technology go far beyond the economic domain.  Appearing in the form of a hologram at The Nantucket Project conference, Assange spoke of the significance of the block chain, the underlying technology of bitcoin, particularly in relation to journalism and holding those in power to account.  Assange addressed the use of the block chain to create an historical archive. Calling bitcoin “the most interesting intellectual development on the Internet in the last five years"", he described how the underlying architecture can be used for “providing proof of publishing at a certain time”.  See a video of Assange's comments below:  The block chain’s premise seemed to unite with WikiLeaks’ mission. In April 2010, Assange took the stage at the Oslo Freedom Forum, where he warned of the enormous force of control and power within the Internet and increasing censorship that threatens the free flow of information.  He spoke of the vital role of human intellectual content in civilization and described how, in this age of technology, everything is moving to digital. This power, often accrued by an unelected few, has increased through control of digital storage and access to information. This makes possible the erasing or altering of information that is critical to the historical record. He pointed out:  “We are now approaching the state of Orwell’s dictum, perfect dictum, that ‘he who controls the present controls the past’. He who controls the Internet servers controls the intellectual record of mankind, and by controlling that, controls our perception of who we are, and by controlling that, controls what laws and regulations we make in society.”  Preserving history  Dismantling this force of control has been WikiLeaks’ mission. By employing its method of transparency in the form of 'scientific journalism', they aimed to open governments and reveal their actions behind closed doors.  Through liberating the flow of information that had been stagnated by secrecy, complexity and manipulation, the organization strove to break Orwell’s dictum and bring the power to shape history into the hands of ordinary people.  Four years later, WikiLeaks is still on the front lines of this battle. In his new book, Assange again addressed the escalating implementation of Orwell’s dictum.  Giving an example of an incident where the Guardian pulled six articles from 2003 without explanation, he emphasized how WikiLeaks’ primary focus was to preserve “politically salient intellectual content while it is under attack” by going after information that has been suppressed or deleted.  Doing away with trust  Assange found a solution in the evolving block-chain technology. This provides decentralized solutions to the problems of centralized time stamping, as this requires trust in central authority, making it susceptible to third-party alteration and intervention.  Bitcoin’s distributed trust network can offer immunity from central control of any historical record. Assange described the basic premise of this technology as a network of consensus where “you can prove a particular statement, particular consensus and particular contract that happened at a particular time globally and it requires the subversion of every single jurisdiction where people are running bitcoin to overturn that”.  [post-quote]  In a nutshell, he noted: “bitcoin’s underlying technology breaks Orwell’s dictum”.  Some people have already used the block chain to store more than just transactions. In his blog, Ken Shirriff documented the result of his search through the block-chain 'database', reporting his discovery of interesting things including Satoshi Nakamoto’s white-paper, an image of Nelson Mandela and a 2.5-megabyte WikiLeaks cablegate backup. This information is now securely documented and cannot be erased or modified by anyone.  Proof of Existence  is an example of the application of decentralized proof. This online service provides a way for people to publicly prove the existence of documents without revealing the data or their identity through bitcoin’s decentralized trust network.  It is a continuation of the earlier waves of decentralization of information seen in the last decade with the rise of Wikipedia, through its open-source collaborative production of a historical record – an online decentralized encyclopedia.  Freedom from control  Just as the Internet brought the everyday person the power to create their own narratives, the invention of the block chain further empowers people and challenges the insidious culture of ownership and control.  With unprecedented currency crises and government corruption, people are increasingly looking for alternatives to state and corporate control. As more begin to move into bitcoin to avoid government debasement, it isn’t far-fetched to imagine how this stateless public asset ledger could also become a new safe haven for investigative journalism and whistle-blowers.  A lot has happened since that day in Oslo when Assange identified the conundrum of our age. As the battle to break Orwell’s dictum intensifies, we now have in our hands a great tool to open up society.  Bitcoin can not only be used to fund revolutionary journalism like WikiLeaks, but also offers a decentralized platform for anyone to directly combat state censorship of information and create transparency for those in power.  The invention of bitcoin is just one crest of the continuous waves of a cryptographic revolution. As Assange said, this could free us from Orwell’s dictum.  In a time of seemingly universal deceit, reclaiming our past on the block chain is quickly becoming a revolutionary act.

42377708,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73BK5,1413347417,"Moolah Announces Bankruptcy Plan, MintPal Transition Amid Money Crisis","Moopay LTD, the digital currency services business better known as Moolah, has announced that it is shutting its doors and filing for bankruptcy protection.  The move follows the failed relaunch of the MintPal altcoin exchange, which, after weeks of preparation, was marred by chronic user and platform issues. According to Moolah, its closure stems from an unexpected rise in operational costs and the loss of critical business partnerships in the past month.  In its announcement, Moolah said that customer funds are secure and that users of its consumer and merchant money management platform can process withdrawals until 31st October, after which time Moolah will shut down.  The company also said that MintPal will continue to operate as a separate business, but prior to the appointment of a new leadership team will be put offline in order to address what the company called “critical errors” in the platform's security infrastructure.  At press time, the MintPal website was not accessible and contained a message reading that the new leadership, once in place, will release a statement.  Moolah CEO and founder Alex Green said that it no longer had the funds to continue functioning as a business after incurring high legal and operational costs during the past 10 months.  He told CoinDesk:  “Quite simply, we ran out of cash. Rather than end up in massive amounts of debt, we made the decision to close down the business. We can no longer afford to pay our operational and staffing expenses, and we feel that we have made the best decision all around.”  Moolah’s shutdown ends a long chapter for both the dogecoin and altcoin communities, as the United Kingdom-based company was a significant provider of services to the dogecoin userbase and had invested heavily in the relaunch of MintPal, which suffered a debilitating hacking attack earlier this year.  The startup was not without controversy though, as tensions between Moolah and members of the altcoin community often played out online for all to see.  The closure itself sparked a social media firestorm, with users taking to the dogecoin subreddit, Twitter and IRC to both search for answers and weigh in on the developments. Many customers of both Moolah and MintPal expressed fear that the closure would affect withdrawals from both platforms.  Canceled deals triggers crisis  In its bankruptcy announcement, Moolah said that efforts were made to secure new revenue streams, which included a last-ditch attempt to build partnerships in Asia.  The company said:  ""A number of the team have spent the past 10 days in Asia (personally funded, not company funded) attempting to secure vital contracts that would ensure the future of the company, but these attempts proved fruitless given general opposition by the businesses in question into entering into agreements with non-Asian companies.”  According to Green, Moolah’s expenditures included $45,000 per month in labor costs, along with an additional $22,000 in legal and operational expenses. He added that the company does not hold substantial amounts of debt, but owes some of its suppliers for past payments.  Green left the door open to a potential future for the company, telling CoinDesk that in the days ahead alternative options to closure will be explored.  “We will be waiting until the last possible moment to fully wind down the company, in order to explore any and all avenues that may present themselves,” he said.  He added that Moolah is seeking to retain a company to assist it in winding down its operations and transition to a new management team, saying that several outside parties have expressed interest in Moolah’s technological portfolio as well as the company itself.  Future uncertain for investors  For now, some of the biggest questions surrounding the Moolah shutdown focus on the future of those who took part in the investment initiative it ran.  The company offered few details on the future of funds owed to investors in its so-called PIE program, which raised 750 BTC during three investment rounds and sparked controversy within the dogecoin community. Moolah said that it expects to liquidate its assets and pay off creditors, after which “the remaining funds will be divided accordingly between investors in the company”.  Many of the investors in the PIE initiative came from the dogecoin community, and the altcoin’s subreddit has seen an influx of comments from stakeholders concerned about what, if any, restitution they might receive following bankruptcy.  Dogecoin co-founder Jackson Palmer told CoinDesk that the Moolah closure demonstrates the risks of crypto crowd sales and the businesses that conduct them. Calling the practice “a legal grey area and a possible minefield”, Palmer reiterated his past opposition to Moolah’s past actions.  Palmer continued:  “What saddens me the most is that Moolah took their funding from random Internet-goers as opposed to rich venture capitalists who can afford to take the risk and financial hit. These 'investors' are now in a position where they'll never see their money again, and have minimal legal recourse.”  He added that he expects incidents like the Moolah closure will trigger involvement from financial regulators, particularly securities and investment watchdogs like the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). However, Palmer predicted that the dogecon community will recover and “come back fighting”.  “At the end of the day, it's a stark reminder to always investigate who you're doing business with prior to entrusting your money with them,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/15/moolah-announces-bankruptcy-plan-mintpal-transition-amid-money-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fc80ddaec635d2a2f524f958173e6fbadff051f-2560x1706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
