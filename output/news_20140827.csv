42377574,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX727M7,1409175905,Bitcoin Malware Attack Exploits Russia-Ukraine Crisis,"A hacker group is trying to leverage the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine as it distributes malware that is capable of targeting bitcoin wallets.  A report by Bitdefender Labs, a cybersecurity firm that focuses on the digital currency market, highlights how an alleged hacker group disguised one form of malware as another. According to the report, the perpetrators distributed software that they described as capable of disrupting the digital activities of Western governments fighting against Russia.  In reality, the program secretly installs a malware package called Kelihos. This malicious program, first identified nearly five years ago, is capable of stealing the contents of a user’s bitcoin wallets, among other negative effects.  Notably, the most recent attack targeted Ukrainian Internet users disproportionately, accounting for roughly 40% of those impacted. In a statement, Bitdefender analyst Doina Cosovan explained:  “Some of the IPs might indicate the origin of servers specialized in malware distribution or other infected computers that became part of the Kelihos botnet. As most of the infected IPs are from Ukraine, this either means that computers in the country were also infected, or that Ukraine itself is home to the main distribution servers.”  Beyond bitcoin theft, the Kelihos malware is capable of enslaving a host computer to a global botnet, allowing a hacker to use that machine to distribute spam, scan data or even continue the spread of the malicious software.  Masked as nationalist initiative  Bitdefender indicated that the hackers tried to pass off their “software” as a way for affected users to create problems for the Russian government. Notably, the message accompanying the malware claimed that the hacker group was located inside Russia itself.  The message read:  “We, a group of hackers from the Russian Federation, are worried about the unreasonable sanctions that Western states imposed against our country. We have coded our answer and bellow [sic] you will find the link to our program. Run the application on your computer, and it will secretly begin to attack government agencies of the states that have adopted those sanctions.”  As Bitdefender explained, the message included a link that downloads the Kelihos program – and with it, the capability for the hackers to begin seizing control of the computer.  Malware threat still exists  Despite improvements in the ways that people can store their digital currency, the threat of malware attacks targeting bitcoin balances remains.  Recent reports suggest that attempts to steal bitcoin are growing more common. As noted by Kaspersky Labs, 22% of malware attacks related to finance targeted bitcoin. Malware attempts have been disguised in a number of ways, including wallpaper apps on the Google Play store.  The malware problem has attracted the attention of government officials and financial regulators, and often forms the basis for consumer and investor warnings on the topic of digital currency.  Agencies such as the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Securities Exchange Commission have weighed in on the issue. Overall, the malware problem is cited as a key reason for users to be wary of digital currency.

42377579,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX727Pt,1409158734,Banking Survey: 65% of US Consumers 'Unlikely' to Buy Bitcoin,"A new study suggests that many consumers remain cautious about the prospect of purchasing or using digital currency.  The report was written by the Massachusetts Division of Banks (MDB) in conjunction with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), who canvassed more than 1,000 consumers with an online survey that focused on digital currency.  The CSBS, which is a national organization of bank regulators, previously held a hearing on the topic of digital currency in May.  The survey data shows that while a slim majority of respondents (51%) have heard of digital currency, 65% stated that they are “unlikely” to ever buy or use a technology like bitcoin.  Eighteen percent of participants indicated that they were “likely” or “very likely” to use a digital currency, and only 3% of those who had heard of bitcoin said they had actually bought some.  Research phase  According to the CSBS, the Emerging Payments Task Force – the organization’s working group that focuses, in part, on bitcoin – will use the data as it continues to develop its policies for digital currency.  In a statement, the chairman of the task force and Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks David Cotney said that the study fits into the broader research phase currently taking place.  He explained:  “State regulators welcome innovations that lead to greater choice and lower costs, but we also want to understand any consumer and marketplace risks as we evaluate the overall benefits of virtual currencies.""  Concerns highlighted  Fears regarding security and regulation, as well as concerns regarding the lack of consumer protections afforded in the traditional financial system, were highlighted in the study.  Sixty-one percent said that the overall security of their bitcoins would factor significantly into whether or not they used or purchased some, while 43% of study participants stated that bitcoin’s tax status would be a major factor. Forty-eight percent reported that concerns of insurance might stop them from buying bitcoin.  The report highlighted answers from roughly 350 participants who gave additional comments on the topic of digital currency. Twenty-five percent suggested that, because of their concerns, they would never buy bitcoin. The overall safety of the process was questioned by 13% of respondents, while 14% suggested that they didn’t know how digital currency might be used.  Age and affluence a factor  The data also highlighted how knowledge and perception of digital currency breaks down by age demographics. Overall, younger respondents expressed far greater levels of enthusiasm for bitcoin than older participants.  Forty-three percent of those in the 18–24 age bracket stated that they were “likely” or “very likely” to purchase or use digital currency. Only 8% of those over the age of 55 shared that sentiment, and 75% of respondents who were at least 65 years old said they would most likely not use or buy bitcoin.  The MDB report also showed that affluence has played a role in how consumers learn about digital currency. In the study group, 70% of those who made more than $100,000 annually had heard of bitcoin, while 43% of respondents from lower-income households said they knew about or had used digital currency.  The study also noted that those who had graduated from college were more likely to know about bitcoin compared to those with a high school diploma or lower qualification.

42377590,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX727dj,1409153420,Bootstrapping a Bitcoin Startup Amid Argentina's Financial Uncertainty,"While innovative ideas aren't in short supply in the bitcoin community, bootstrapping a bitcoin business remains a risky proposition no matter how promising the market.  For example, despite the widespread perception that Argentina has emerged as the leading bitcoin market in Latin America, the country still poses a significant challenge for entrepreneurs given its lack of regulatory clarity and history of capital controls.  Despite these challenges, however, Argentina's entrepreneurs are seeking to bring the benefits of bitcoin to the market. One such entrepreneur is Matías Bari, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin brokerage SatoshiTango, a Buenos Aires-based business that styles itself as a Coinbase for the country's bitcoin users.  A former chemical engineer and e-commerce industry veteran, Bari first learned about bitcoin in 2013 upon reading about the then-unfolding saga of Silk Road. Like many, Bari's initial interest soon blossomed into a fascination with cryptography. Bari told his friend and current partner Mariano Craiem about bitcoin, and both were soon hooked on its potential.  Bari recalled:  ""For three to four months, everyday we were saying let's do something with bitcoin, we have to do something with bitcoin, so we started to learn, we bought bitcoin, we sold bitcoin, we lost money, we made money, then we said 'OK, let's do this, let's start a business.'""  Together with two additional partners, Bari and Craiem launched SatoshiTango with the goal of making bitcoin buying and selling easy for the average Argentinian, putting their savings on the line in the process.  The power of prepaid  For SatoshiTango, Bari is seeking to create a user-friendly system that avoids the clutter and financial jargon of a traditional bitcoin exchange, while leveraging financial tools that are more familiar to Argentinian shoppers.  One notable design aspect is that users don't buy bitcoin directly from the SatoshiTango website. Rather, they order a prepaid card featuring a 16-digit code that they can then use online to purchase bitcoin.  Bari explained:  ""We believe that if people are familiar with prepaid cards, why not use these? People are very happy because they understand when they buy a prepaid card, the card is ready to buy bitcoin, and the exact amount they have in their hands is what they can buy.""  Argentinian consumers, Bari said, are used to pre-paying for purchases, and that such buying behavior is common among cellphone users, who pay for minutes as needed, rather than on a monthly basis.  Notably, the idea to use prepaid services as an onboarding tool is not unique to SatoshiTango. Argentina-based merchant processor BitPagos, for example, recently launched Ripio, a service that allows bitcoin users to make purchases using a popular mobile phone recharging service.  Sellers, in turn, can choose to receive their money by wire transfer or in cash, although the cash delivery service is available only to residents in Buenos Aires. SatoshiTango charges a 2% fee for all transactions.  Finding solutions  Of course, given the difficulties of operating in Argentina, Bari indicated that the SatoshiTango service is not yet as advanced as it aspires to be.  For example, he notes that while he is happy with SatoshiTango's prepaid payment system, his company is currently barred from more advanced solutions like those in the US that might be more consumer friendly.  ""We cannot do the same thing that Coinbase does. We cannot take money with an ACH [automated clearing house transaction], with an automatic debit from a bank account, it's not legal in Argentina,"" Bari explained.  As a self-funded startup, Bari also noted the challenge of handling legal costs to ensure his service is compliant with local laws. However, Bari said, his startup intends to shoulder this burden using their personal funds, adding:  ""You can really spend a lot of money on advising, but we're willing to spend that money, we're using our savings and trying to figure out how to make the next step.""  In spite of the company's efforts to offer an introductory service, Bari suggests that mainstream user adoption of bitcoin is still far off, noting that most of the company's users are early bitcoin adopters.  Real risk remains  Bari acknowledged that Argentina's government is still learning about bitcoin, and that his belief is that its officials still harbor certain reservations about its use.  In part, Bari said, this is due to misconceptions about bitcoin that the community can take action to help dispel. Referring to the recent restrictive policies embraced in Ecuador and Bolivia, he said:  ""We need to help the authorities to understand that this is not a way to launder money. [...] I think that most of this banning takes place because of fear and misinformation.""  When asked about fellow Argentina-based bitcoin exchange Unisend and its issues securing a bank account, Bari acknowledged the possibility that his business could face similar operational challenges.  Still, he chose instead to focus on the benefits that persevering through this period of uncertainty would bring, saying:  ""It's a challenge, but once you succeed in Argentina, you can go to other countries in Latin America. It's much easier. You get trained here, you have to work so hard for things that in other places are not that hard.""  Sweat and struggle  Bari said that SatoshiTango is currently a four-man operation and, for now, the founders plan to keep it that way, although they do recognize they will need the capital to realize their goals down the road.  Working at a bootstrapped business means all four members juggle multiple tasks, speaking to customers, adding new features to the site and keeping up to date on an evolving industry.  Here again Bari emphasized the positive aspects of working in such an operation where the founders' ""sweat and blood"" are the main ingredients for success.  He concluded:  ""I wake up earlier than before, because I like to start my day with SatoshiTango, and I believe that is the great advantage. We really enjoy this.""

42377569,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX727H5,1409144793,Apple's New Digital Wallet Patent References 'Virtualised Currencies',"Many analysts expect Apple to enter the mobile payments space soon and a recent patent application that has just been made public appears to back those claims.  The patent application reveals the backend architecture for a versatile mobile ""omni-wallet"", and, notably for the cryptocurrency community, also references ""virtualised currencies"" – although this does not necessarily mean Apple will enable digital currency functionality.  Unlike Google, which uses an open approach with Android, Apple enforces very strict policies in its iOS ecosystem. The Cupertino-based tech giant vets every app submitted to its app store and for some months refused to all allow cryptocurrency apps in its walled garden.  That changed in June, with a revision of its App Store Review Guidelines that opened the floodgates for iOS bitcoin apps once again.  QR, Cloud and NFC functionality  The backend patent application describes a comprehensive wallet system that can handle digital debit and credit cards, along with coupons issued by merchants and other organisations.  The ""virtualised currency"" reference does not necessarily suggest the wallet will be capable of storing digital currencies like bitcoin and is general enough that it could cover a wide range of concepts, ranging from store credit to various loyalty schemes offered by merchants, or even Apple itself.  There is another alternative: Apple could choose to introduce a digital currency of its own, similar to Amazon Coins. The US Patent and Trademark Organisation (USPTO) published an Apple patent application for 'iMoney' last year.  Putting the pieces together  Apple does not have a habit of launching incomplete products. The company is renowned for polishing and, perhaps, overdesigning its products, both in the software and hardware departments. So we expect nothing less from its upcoming payments push.  And while the company usually keeps a tight lid on leaks, it does seem to be setting up the building blocks for a comprehensive mobile payments service.  Last year’s iPhone 5S launched with Touch ID, a simple fingerprint sensor that enables biometric authentication. With the iOS 8 Touch ID API, the company will open up the sensor to third-party apps. It is also rumoured that Apple will integrate Near Field Communications (NFC) in upcoming iPhones, which could launch in a matter of weeks.  The company’s iBeacon technology is based on Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy and it is already available on a wide range of Apple devices running iOS 7. The technology has a number of potential applications in brick-and-mortar shops.  On their own, none of these technologies deserve the 'killer app' moniker. However, Apple already has upwards of 800 million user accounts and the sheer size of its user base could prove more important than the technology behind its products and services. Quite what that technology is, we'll just have to wait and see.

42377585,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX727Zx,1409140090,DigitalBTC's New Mining Centre Powered 100% by Renewable Energy,"Australian bitcoin firm digitalBTC has announced a multi-year hosting and power supply agreement with Verne Global – a UK-based company specialised in ""power-conscious"" data centre solutions.  Under the agreement, digitalBTC will instal mining hardware at Verne Global's data centre campus in Iceland, which is powered exclusively by renewable energy, and will source approximately 50% of its power needs from the company.  The remainder of its Icelandic electricity requirements will also be sourced from green suppliers, digitalBTC indicates.  Cutting operating costs  DigitalBTC highlights a number of advantages provided by the new deal. It expects significant savings on power costs of up to 40%, which will in turn help increase the return on investment (ROI) from its bitcoin mining operations.  The savings will also enable the company to extend the life of the mining hardware, as cheaper power means mining hardware remains economically viable for longer periods of time.  Lastly, using dual-sourced renewable energy will significantly reduce the carbon footprint and allow for more expansion.  Zhenya Tsvetnenko, digitalBTC executive chairman, said the agreement would provide the company with stable, cheap and green power in the long run:  “As well as basing our operations on clean renewable energy, we are also able to drive significant power cost reductions, which will flow straight through to our bottom line, and significantly reduce our carbon emission through the use of green energy. Additional power is very hard to secure in many locations, where the capacity has already been reached.”  Tsvetnenko concluded the contract with Verne Global gives digitalBTC more room to grow and will be factored into the company’s decisions on potential expansions.  Green power, free cooling  Verne Global sources power for its data centre campus from Iceland’s power grid, which almost completely relies on geothermal and hydroelectric power.  Furthermore, the company uses 'free-cooling', which essentially means it relies on the naturally low air temperature to keep server temperatures down. This helps the firm save money on cooling, as server rooms usually need a lot of costly air-conditioning to avoid overheating.  Verne Global CEO Jeff Monroe said digital currency is moving into the mainstream and it is becoming clear that digitalBTC is making “sound business decisions” that indicate they will be a significant player in the digital currency industry for years to come.  As far as mining hardware goes, digitalBTC has decided to stick with BitFury. The company ordered its first $2m batch of BitFury miners back in March, with additional tranches following later.  As of 30th June, the company claimed to hold an estimated 3,600 BTC awaiting liquidation and, by July, had mined a total of 8,600 BTC. In a regulatory filing, digitalBTC said it had achieved “complete payback” on $4m-worth of BitFury mining hardware.  In a recent feature, CoinDesk examined how and why bitcoin mining companies are moving to regions with cheaper cooling and energy, with Scandinavia and Iceland proving especially popular.

42377578,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX727R9,1409133293,BlockSign Utilises Block Chain to Verify Signed Contracts,"A new company, BlockSign, lets customers digitally sign legally binding contracts and preserve them in the public domain.  Running on the block chain, the decentralised public ledger that records transactions on the bitcoin network, the BlockSign platform provides a way to sign, timestamp and later verify documents on the web.  How BlockSign works  From a user perspective, BlockSign works as a web application. A PDF signed with the program will indicate where a signature is to be placed, and the user places a stamp in a stylized font there. Into this signature is encoded an email address and the date.  The BlockSign service then creates a cryptographic hash of the entire document, which it stores in a 40-byte slot included in every bitcoin block, called OP_RETURN. That slot can be used for storing messages and other arbitrary data.  That means that the hash is logged in the block chain. “We verify the document, running it through the hashing function, and we search the block chain for the string to see if it has been logged,” said founder Nicholas Thorne.  A verification record stored by the company on the user’s behalf enables users to check that a particular document is signed and valid.  The system’s security relies on two-factor authentication. It sends a confirmation request to the user via email to confirm their identity. Of course, email is notoriously insecure, so Thorne hopes to use private keys at some point.  Misuse of the block chain?  Not all developers are enthusiastic about the idea of using bitcoin for timestamping documents.  “In my opinion, ideally the bitcoin block chain should be used for bitcoin payments,” says Adam Back. He developed Hashcash, the algorithm bitcoin uses to generate and verify currency, and has also been working on a system for application-specific block chains, linked to bitcoin’s own.  OP_RETURN’s 40 bytes were originally meant to be 80 bytes. Today, the 40-byte limit compares to an average recent transaction size of 570 bytes, which makes its theoretical limit roughly 7% of the average block size.  BlockSign doesn’t use all of that OP_RETURN space. It only uses 32 bytes for its hash – and the slot is not used by many people at all today. Roughly a quarter of blocks used OP_RETURN in a recent 80-block block chain sample.  Businesses welcome  Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn isn’t worried about more companies using OP_RETURN for their networks.  “Bitcoin’s limiting factor today is actually growing legitimate usage and traffic,” he said. “The more users we have, the more political immunity we have, so if some of those users care more about time-stamping documents than buying things, that’s OK by me. I’m sure bitcoin can scale to accommodate everyone.”  Having said that, if use of OP_RETURN for applications like BlockSign's caught on, it could be more expensive, Hearn said. ""Like any bitcoin transaction, you have to pay for it using either fees or coin priority. If some company were to start using lots of these transactions, the fee costs would start to increase.""  Both Hearn and Back recommend using a Merkle tree structure, which enables many timestamps to be compressed into a single OP_RETURN output. ""This would be a way to save money for only a little bit of extra code,"" Hearn says.  However, Thorne says that the team hasn't used the Merkle tree system in its first release, arguing that the company wanted to get a product out there that was simple to use. However, the team is considering Merkle tree storage for a future release, he says, arguing that the venture doesn't yet have the volume to make it an issue. BlockSign will have to swallow more transaction fees in the meantime.  Giving back to bitcoin  There is another question, however: should companies piggyback private, for-profit activities on the block chain without investing time in supporting bitcoin development?  Thorne admits that his team of three developers isn’t contributing to bitcoin’s open-source project.  “They would love nothing more than to be able to push up a change that was accepted, and I think they’re working hard to do that, but they probably just haven’t done it yet because they’re still learning a lot and building this one implementation,” said Thorne, adding:  “But I think that will allow us to learn and make recommendations over time and contribute meaningfully to what’s going on.”  Bitcoin core developers have complained about the lack of help from for-profit businesses in the past, and Hearn has pointed out multiple times that protocol development is suffering.  Bitcoin’s lead developer Wladimir van der Laan echoed the need for more support. “There are huge investments in bitcoin companies, but only very little of that ends up helping bitcoin core development,” he said.  About BlockSign  Thorne’s team was originally formed a couple of years ago, as part of Basno, a digital badge company that Thorne founded.  That team raised $1.225m in a seed funding round in summer 2013. Basno is now a revenue-generating business, and the company is using the funding at a “pretty slow burn rate,” Thorne said, adding that BlockSign is a subsidiary of Basno.  Not contributing to the bitcoin protocol's core development while aiming to use it for profit isn’t something unique to BlockSign by any means.  Van der Laansaid:  “Of all the companies in the bitcoin space (including mining pools, mining hardware producers, exchanges, payment processors, wallet vendors), as far as I know it is still only BitPay that has significant contributions to Bitcoin Core.""

42377584,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX727Uv,1409105797,Japanese Politician to Crowdfund Bitcoin Research Tour,"Japanese politician and bitcoin supporter Mineyuki Fukuda has taken a novel approach to bitcoin research, launching an online crowdfunding campaign to conduct a research tour of bitcoin businesses in the US.  So far, Fukuda has raised 52% of his target ¥600,000 ($5,785) needed to fund the mission, which he is conducting independently. By taking the tour as a private citizen, he is not drawing any taxpayer funds.  Fukuda  , a member of parliament with the governing Liberal Democratic Party, has been a pioneer for digital currency acceptance in Japanese politics. As head of the government's IT Strategy Committee, he has frequently met with representatives from the bitcoin community at his office and even attended local meetups.  His efforts have led to the formation of Japan's digital chamber of commerce group the Japan Association of Digital Asset (JADA), which has the government's blessing and will liaise between businesses and relevant government departments.  Crowdfunding campaign  Fukuda's crowdfunding campaign site describes the mission as one that will find the politician ""visiting the frontline"" of the bitcoin and digital currency industry with the intent to exchange opinions and ideas.  ""Bitcoin is called the greatest invention since the Internet,"" it continues.  The campaign details page also lists some basic background and information about bitcoin, and mentions that Japan's own homegrown digital currency, Monacoin, has received international attention.  Donor rewards  As with most crowdfunding campaigns, there is a rewards hierarchy based on the chosen level of participation:  ¥1,000 ($9.60) will earn donors a published copy of Fukuda's research report  ¥3,000 ($28.90) lets you join Fukuda as he makes a street-side 'stump speech' and even speak yourself for three minutes  ¥5,000 ($48.10) allows you to attend a live seminar where Fukuda will present his findings  ¥10,000 ($96.30, limited to 30) gets you a seat at a dinner presentation Fukuda will host (dinner not included)  ¥50,000 ($481, limited to nine) takes you on the full tour of Japan's Parliament House, with Fukuda as a guide and lunch provided.  All donations receive a copy of the report.  Ironically, perhaps, the Japanese crowdfunding platform used, ShootingStar.jp, does not accept bitcoin.  Japanese digital currency policy  Despite the interest shown in digital currencies by Fukuda and other individual members of Japan's parliament from both major parties, the government has no plans for new legislation. Its only official statement has been, “We’re in charge of money. If it’s not money, it’s not the Ministry of Finance/Financial Services Authority’s jurisdiction.”  For now, this is a benefit to bitcoin businesses, as the government has not sought to regulate the industry. Instead it is putting its trust in representative organizations like JADA to form guidelines and help the industry self-govern.  On the other hand, creditors of failed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox (which collapsed before any of the initiatives mentioned here were created) have bemoaned the lack of official consumer protection for bitcoin business users.

42377571,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX727IL,1409099208,Australian Government Portal Publishes Bitcoin Business Guidelines,"The Australian government's online business information portal has published a 'Bitcoin for business' page to advise operators of their tax and other regulatory obligations.  As well as a basic explanation of what bitcoin is and how it works, the business.gov.au page also features sections on accepting bitcoins, tax implications, risks, and paying employee salaries with digital currency.  With headings like ""What are digital currencies and crypto-currencies?"", ""How do I accept Bitcoin in my business?"" and ""Should I accept Bitcoin payments?"" and links to more detailed information, the page is intended for newcomers as well as seasoned digital currency users.  In its closing section headed ""Have your say on the future of digital currencies in Australia"", the portal invites business owners to ""shape the future of digital currencies in Australia"" by leaving feedback.  Unfortunately, there are no guidelines for managing banking relationships or the know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering/counter-terrorism-financing (AML/CTF) regulations – which banks will expect bitcoin businesses to understand, and which often raise their risk profiles above some banks' tolerance levels.  Draft tax guidelines  It follows the recent release of formal draft tax guidelines on bitcoin-related business obligations from the country's revenue collection agency, the Australian Tax Office, which received a somewhat mixed response from the local bitcoin community.  For future tax purposes, Australians transacting in bitcoin will need to keep records on the date of the transaction and party being transacted with (a bitcoin address is adequate), the Australian dollar (AUD) value of the transaction according to reputable exchanges at the time, and a note of what the transaction was for.
