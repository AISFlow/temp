42423518,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aWNh,1650238220,First Mover Asia: Terra Is 2022’s Version of Corporate Bitcoin Buying; Cryptos Hold Steady in Weekend Trading,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin was trading just under the $40,000 threshold where it started the weekend.  Insights: Luna Foundation Guard's bitcoin accumulation differs from purchases by publicly traded companies.  Technician's take: (Editor's note: Due to the long holiday weekend, Technician's Take will not appear. In its place, First Mover Asia is republishing a column by CoinDesk columnist David Z. Morris on Block co-founder Jack Dorsey.)  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $39,928 -1.20%  Ether (ETH): $3,O26 -1.23%  Bitcoin, other major cryptos were flat for the holiday weekend  Bitcoin ended the week perched roughly where it spent much of the past few days, a little above $40,000, and with few signs of a rally.  ""Last week we shared concerns around bitcoin's ability to maintain upward momentum,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote in comments to CoinDesk. ""We highlighted $40K as the struggling point on the downside and that has been the state of the market this week.""  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $39,928, a little lower from where it stood 24 hours earlier and about the same as where it started Friday during the holiday weekend. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was trading at about $3,026, a level from which it has barely budged since last Monday. Other major cryptos were largely in the red, albeit slightly, although SOL was one of the few exceptions rising about 1%.  Trading over the long weekend was light as investors continue to process rising inflation, the possibility of a recession and the latest developments from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Markets, which were closed Friday, were down on Thursday with the tech-focused Nasdaq off more than 2% and the S&P 500 falling 1.2%.  Russia pressed forward with its attacks on major Ukraine cities, including the capital Kyiv, and demanded the surrender of the strategic Black Sea port of Mariupol in the southeast. Ukraine Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Sunday that discussions with Russia about establishing humanitarian corridors for civilians to evacuate major Ukraine cities had broken down.  Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager BitBull, was pessimistic about the coming week, noting that support could form well below $40,000. ""Things still don't look particularly bullish for bitcoin, and we continue to look for a reaction around $37K,"" he wrote. ""For any upward move, BTC will need to consolidate around $42K in the coming week – an unlikely scenario in the absence of major news or catalysts.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,392 -1.2%  DJIA: 34,451 -0.3%  Nasdaq: 13,351 -2.1%  Gold: $1,974 +.05%  Insights  Terra Is 2022’s Version of Corporate Bitcoin Buying  Michael Saylor really wants corporations to follow his lead and put bitcoin on the balance sheet. In early 2021 the MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO held a seminar on that topic, and claimed to have an audience of 1,400 firms. Having bitcoin in the corporate treasury alongside equities and bonds was supposed to cement the asset class in the history books, and lead to it hitting $6 million.  A year later, corporations don’t seem overly interested. According to CoinGecko’s tracker of public companies, there aren’t a lot of new entities that have added crypto to their balance sheets over the last year. The only non-major crypto or payments firm to have it is Tesla (TSLA). Block (SQ), the former Square, has it as it allows its clients to trade crypto, while a few game developers have it as part of a Web 3 gaming push or because they accept crypto as a payment method.  Saylor continues to add it to the MicroStrategy balance sheet, saying in a recent note to investors, “Adopting bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset set us apart from conventional competitors and elevated our brand.”  But he just can’t convince others to do the same. For listed firms, bitcoin is notoriously difficult to deal with from an accounting perspective. The narrative that bitcoin’s value will hit all-time highs because of corporate faith in it just didn’t materialize.  But in this void, Terra has stepped in with its frequent bitcoin buys, which pushed the Luna Foundation Guard’s (LFG) bitcoin holdings to nearly $1.7 billion. Founder Do Kwon has expressed a wish for that number to hit $10 billion. The current total makes Terra/LFG the second-largest corporate holder behind MicroStrategy’s $3.9 billion.  Does the market care about this narrative? Not really. The correlation between LFG’s bitcoin buys and the price of bitcoin is weakening; the last few buys didn’t stop bitcoin’s decline.  CryptoQuant’s data suggests that institutional interest continues to be strong for crypto, but hedge funds, family offices and high-net-worth individuals aren’t listed corporations. They would have a different investment thesis, and tempo, than what Saylor prescribed for corporations.  LFG’s mandate for buying crypto is also different from what a listed firm would do, and it is important is to look at the scale of the HODLing as well as the tempo.  LFG isn’t a listed Fortune 500 company, so the market doesn’t apply the same prestige to the purchases as bitcoin continues to stay correlated with equities and decline in value. Which, in turn, is the same logic that tells corporate treasurers that perhaps bitcoin isn’t the best asset for their books.  Technician's take  Jack Dorsey, Block and the Perils of Making Crypto User-Friendly (by CoinDesk columnist David Z. Morris)  Last July, payments startup/giant (can you be both?) Square announced that it would be developing a hardware cryptocurrency wallet. The prospect of a wallet designed by the same folks who build the world’s fastest-growing point-of-sale technology promised exciting advances in ease of use and adoption. And that was months before Jack Dorsey flipped the tech world table by resigning from Twitter to focus on Square (now Block) full time, even further upping the stakes.  But, for perhaps the first time in Dorsey’s years-long flirtation with Bitcoin (“crypto,” not so much), there’s a significant disconnect between his plans and crypto long-timers’ preferences. In a Friday blog post, Block (SQ) announced its hardware wallet would make fingerprint identification the primary and default method for users to access their funds. Block does say it will “evaluate additional access methods that customers could opt into.”  At least in the case of consumer goods like cell phones, the motivation for adding biometric access control is usually simple convenience, but the ultimate implications could be dire. Another Web 2 holdover, Sam Altman, a former president of Y Combinator, a firm that helps fund tech startups, introduced a token called worldcoin over the summer of 2021. Critics including Edward Snowden pointed out that the scheme would risk exposing users’ biometric data with potentially severe and permanent consequences for victims. When the ruthless capitalists at the American Enterprise Institute think your plan is anti-social, you know you’re in trouble.  To be fair, the Block plan is different from the worldcoin one in crucial ways that make it more defensible. In part because the planned wallet is a single-user device, it will be able to create and store its biometric credentials locally, as your phone does. Worldcoin, by contrast, seemed likely to require a centralized database of iris-scan hashes, an absolute five-alarm fire of poor security architecture.  But even local processing and storage is a real risk – ultimately, no local data that can be reached via the internet should ever be considered truly secure. And the literally lifelong consequences of a compromised fingerprint make even the remotest exposure worth seriously interrogating.  Equally worrisome, making a fingerprint the main way of authorizing a crypto wallet could mean less emphasis on private key management. That could introduce an added risk vector for users: if your hardware wallet is the only home of your private keys, and that hardware is controlled by a fingerprint, the risk of losing all your money just went up rather than down.  Block seems well aware of the risks here, based on both the content and timing of the announcement. “We're aware of limitations [of fingerprint security] we'll need to design around,” the announcement states. And in the communications business, Fridays are when you drop news you don’t want anyone to pay too much attention to – reporters are largely finishing up their assignments and looking forward to a blissful weekend. So it’s a good bet Block was seeking to minimize blowback here.  All that said, Block is trying to thread an extremely tricky needle, and its current plans deserve a thoughtful rather than knee-jerk response. The announcement post makes clear the priority was to design a wallet that can be used “securely, but with ease,” balancing user experience with safety.  “We don’t want to force new behaviors on customers with a novel interface on the hardware component of the wallet we’re building,” the announcement continues. “Instead, making the mobile application the center of the experience will lead to familiar, intuitive interactions.”  For better or worse, we’re very used to using fingerprint unlocks on smaller devices. So using them makes absolute sense from a Silicon Valley hardware designer’s perspective. The presumption that something should be a mass-market product, ideally usable by even the slowest kids on the bus, is baked into the business models and culture of even relatively agile entities like Block.

Morris - Jack Dorsey Takes Square Deep Down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole  The logic also, however, aligns with many calls within the crypto industry to prioritize making user experience better and more intuitive, not just for wallets but also for decentralized exchanges (DEX) and everything else. The problem, as crypto and security experts including MetaMask’s Taylor Monahan have pointed out, is that a smooth user experience is almost inextricable from security risks. In fact, she specifically cites another “ease-of-use” feature that led people to not save their private keys properly. It's about a feature of an early version of MyCrypto/MEW, the wallet Monahan built before joining Metamask recently. Specifically, the feature was an automatic download/display of all the wallet information that people apparently forgot to write down pretty often.  Ultimately, there will eventually be crypto products that strike the right balance between security and usability. But frankly, I think companies rushing in that direction now are shortchanging the entire ecosystem by de-emphasizing education. In fact, the assumption that front-end design can make a crypto system just as smooth and effortless to use as a Web 2 system may well prove to be fundamentally flawed: The complexity of crypto is inextricable from its decentralization, and methods of “abstracting away” that complexity almost always add new attack surfaces for people who want to take your money.

A flash loan in crypto allows a user to borrow and repay a loan in a single transaction, which minimizes risk for lenders and can streamline processes for borrowers. In the Beanstalk Farms hack, the hacker borrowed nearly a third of the BEAN supply, roughly 32 million tokens and utilized Curve Finance&apos;s $3Crv tokens to generate a unique tokens &apos;BEAN3CRV-f&apos; and &apos;BEAN3LUSD-f.&apos; The attacker utilized these two new tokens to deceive Beanstalk&apos;s governance model and gave the hacker a massive majority holding of &apos;seeds,&apos; the platform&apos;s governance token.

The attack was flagged on Twitter by blockchain security firm PeckShield, which said the attacker made away with at least $80 million in crypto, although the losses suffered by the protocol were much larger.  The market for Beanstalk’s BEAN stablecoin collapsed as a result of the attack. At press time, the token was down 86% from its $1 peg, according to CoinGecko.  When reached for comment, Beanstalk pointed CoinDesk to a post in its Discord server summarizing how the attack occurred.  According to the summary, the attacker took out a flash loan on lending platform Aave, which was used to amass a large amount of Beanstalk’s native governance token, stalk. With the voting power granted by these stalk tokens, the attacker was able to quickly pass a malicious governance proposal that drained all protocol funds into a private Ethereum wallet.  According to PeckShield, the attacker laundered all stolen funds through Tornado Cash, which enables users to send and receive crypto while obfuscating its source.  Project leads wrote in the attack summary:  “Beanstalk did not use a flash loan resistant measure to determine the % of Stalk that had voted in favor of the [governance proposal]. This was the fault that allowed the hacker to exploit Beanstalk.”  Beanstalk’s smart contracts were audited by the blockchain security firm Omnicia. However, the audit was completed before the introduction of the flash loan vulnerability, the firm said in a Sunday post-mortem.  Beanstalk declined to provide details to CoinDesk regarding whether funds would be reimbursed to users, saying more news will be coming in a town hall event scheduled for Sunday.  The attacker appeared to donate $250,000 of the stolen funds to a Ukrainian relief wallet, according to PeckShield.  This is the latest in a string of major decentralized finance (DeFi) exploits to occur in the past few weeks. In March, Axie Infinity’s Ronin Blockchain was exploited for $625 million in an attack that U.S. officials have linked to North Korea.

42394233,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaToP,1650207000,Is Bitcoin a Risk-On or a Risk-Off Asset? Maybe It’s Neither,"Google (or DDG) “inflation” and you’ll find articles with headlines from basically every media outlet saying something like: “US Inflation Jumps to Fresh 4-Decade High of 8.5% in March.” That’s a big number. When inflation fear enters the conversation, investors go “risk-off,” and they pile into inflation hedges and store-of-value assets like gold and … like bitcoin?  Well then, why didn’t bitcoin’s price rocket up after the inflation print came out last week? Is bitcoin a bad inflation hedge? Is it ever going to be a store of value? For all its promise, Bitcoin’s sound money properties should predispose it toward being a useful inflation hedge and store of value. That has fallen flat. So what gives? How aspirational is the “bitcoin as a store-of-value” narrative? Are bitcoin investors screwed? Why is bitcoin acting like a tech stock?  That (and maybe more) below…  – George Kaloudis  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Prevailing economic theory is built upon three pillars: output, money and expectations. The people and groups that run economies want to increase economic output and strengthen their sovereign money against other currencies while managing expectations for the future to avoid economic downturns. There’s not enough room in a column to dive into the gory details of all of these concepts, but let’s zoom in on money, expectations and the entity responsible for those two in the U.S., the Federal Reserve, and tie it into recent inflation woes (and Bitcoin!).  The Fed has been given responsibility for monetary policy in the U.S. and aims to ensure “maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.” The Fed has three levers it can pull to achieve its goal: 1) open market operations (i.e. “print money”), 2) the discount rate (i.e. “interest rates”) and 3) reserve requirements (i.e. “vault deposit rules”). Printing money (by buying bonds and “stuff”) and changing interest rates (by changing the rate it charges banks to lend money overnight) are the main mechanisms we’ve seen the Fed employ in recent memory.  And, wow, does the Fed have its hands full right now.  “Stable prices'' is a goal for the Fed, and that has historically meant an arbitrary 2% target for inflation each year, meaning the Fed wants things to cost 2% more each year. Well, last week the consumer price index, a means to measure inflation, jumped to a four-decade high of 8.5% year-over-year in March. Basically, last year’s $10 burrito is now $10.85. That is not a good thing. On top of that, year-over-year CPI metrics have exceeded 2% every month since March 2021. Inflation is clearly not transitory.  I’m not going to talk about how unprecedented money printing and near-zero interest rates might have led us here. Instead, I’m going to talk about what investors are doing to protect their portfolios.  In times of high inflation and economic uncertainty, investors go risk-off, and there’s a “flight to quality.” In practice, when sentiment flips risk-off, investors sell their risky tech stocks and buy something like bonds, or if they really fear inflation, something sound like gold.  And you know what’s better than gold? Gold 2.0 of course. Bitcoin (or the Reserve Asset 3.0). We have high inflation, and so everyone piled into bitcoin and its price shot up, right? Not quite…     What gives? This is sound money, right? This is a store of value with a known current supply and emissions schedule, right? Isn’t bitcoin provably scarce? I thought the emissions schedule of bitcoin didn’t change as demand for the asset increased?  That’s all true: Bitcoin has a known monetary policy with a hard cap and a predetermined minting schedule; anyone with a full node (a basic computer with some software) can tell you how many bitcoins are in circulation and if the price of bitcoin went to $1 million tomorrow, the coins wouldn’t be mined any faster than they are today.  But there’s one thing missing.  Narrative.  On a 60-day lookback, bitcoin’s price has been somewhat correlated (> 0.20 correlation coefficient) with the technology stocks in the Nasdaq for about 50% of trading days in 2022. I think the reason for that is quite simple. While bitcoin’s hard money properties make it a risk-off asset for its supporters, investors see a risk-on asset because of its volatility and technology-like asymmetric price upside. When investors want to cut risk, they sell stocks alongside bitcoin. So bitcoin isn’t a risk-off or risk-on asset yet. Instead, I think it’s better to call it “risk everything.”  As such, it is probably more accurate to refer to bitcoin as an aspirational store of value. Yes, a borderless, permissionless, uncensorable, sound monetary system-of-value transfer with a predictable monetary policy is theoretically a great store of value, but until that narrative penetrates more than 100 million people, the other 7.8 billion people won’t view that system as a store of value, and that narrative will prevail.

A close below this mark may see ILV slide to $480. Past Performance of Illuvium The Illuvium token remains under pressure at spot rates, under-performing the USDT. In the previous trading week, ILV is down 10 percent and continues to slide, aligning with steep losses of early this week. Overall, sellers have the upper hand as per the Illuvium candlestick formation in the daily chart. ILV Technical Analysis The coin is within a bear breakout formation below the middle BB reading from the performance in the daily chart. Although buyers are optimistic, sellers have their best foot forward, unwinding gains of 2021. In the daily chart, ILV is down 50 percent from 2022 highs. Since Illuvium buyers didn&apos;t close above February highs of around $735, confirming gains of early March 2022, sellers have the upper hand. Thus far, ILV prices are capped within the April 11 bear candlestick, swinging price action to favor sellers in the short term. A close below $520 may trigger a sell-off forcing Illuvium to 2022 lows of around $480. Conversely, a high volume expansion swinging prices above $585 may be the basis for another leg up to March 2022 highs of $680. What to Expect from Illuvium? Technically, sellers have the upper hand. A close below this week&apos;s lows at $520 will place more liquidation pressure on ILV, possibly forcing it back to Q1 2022 lows.Th...",NEGATIVE,USDT,ICO | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/illuvium-ilv-is-down-50-from-2022-highs-as-it-finds-relief-at-480/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=illuvium-ilv-is-down-50-from-2022-highs-as-it-finds-relief-at-480,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

54410,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=231971,1650175554,Here’s Why Ethereum Gas Fee Reached Its Lowest In Six Months,"Calculated in small units of Ether called gwei, gas fees are payments paid by users to the Ethereum blockchain for the computer energy necessary to process and confirm transactions on the network. These gas fees are majorly influenced by transaction demand between miners and users of Ethereum. The demand for transactions can become so high that miners can opt to prioritize those who pay the most, which will in turn encourage users to pay more in exchange for the ability to have their transactions completed fast. Ethereum&apos;s gas fees are known to be more expensive than those of other cryptocurrencies. This may be related to the increase in the price of ETH as well as the increase in the quantity of traffic on the network. The value of ETH is increasing, and transaction fees are becoming higher when compared with fiat. As more and more Ethereum decentralized applications are being adopted, the gas fees tend to go higher. For instance, the average gas fees were as high as $68 in May of last year, around the same time DeFi and NFTs gained a lot of popularity. As the demand for ETH increased with more people buying NFTs, the gas fees increased in tandem with the rise in the crypto price.
