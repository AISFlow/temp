As investors began their countdown toward a 75 basis point interest rate hike that the U.S. central bank is widely expected to announce later this week, they continued to back off riskier assets, pushing bitcoin well below $22,000 for the first time in a week.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $21,6000, down nearly 5% for the past 24 hours. Bitcoin began to sink early Monday (UTC time) as investors renewed fretting about the Federal Reserve and other central banks' ability to tame inflation without throwing the economy into a steep recession. Bitcoin has fallen four consecutive days since topping $24,000 last Wednesday and inspiring hopes that it had bottomed out.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap after bitcoin, was recently changing hands under $1,500, off more than 8% during the same period and well off its most recent high above $1,600. Other major altcoins were also swimming in red, with AVAX and MATIC both off over 10% at one point.  ""Cryptocurrencies are broadly weaker as investors await [a Federal Open Market Committee] decision that will likely conclude with a 75 basis point rate increase and reaffirm a commitment to fighting inflation,"" wrote Oanda Senior Analyst Americas Edward Moya in an email, although he added, ""Rising geopolitical tensions might provide some underlying support for the dollar, which could drag down risk appetite, which would weigh on cryptos.""  Stocks and earnings  Crypto's decline veered somewhat from equity indexes, which traded sideways on Monday. The tech-focused Nasdaq dropped a few fractions of a percentage point but the S&P 500, which has a heavy tech component, declining slightly. The traditional safe-haven investment gold also dropped a few ticks, following its gradual downturn of the past few months.  Aside from monetary policy, investors will also be eyeing earnings from Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Facebook parent company Meta Platforms (FB) to gauge the severity and speed of the expected economic contraction. They are hoping the pace will be gradual, an at least somewhat soft landing that would suggest the Fed has made progress taming inflation.  Monday also offered its latest twist on one of the debacles that is likely to haunt the crypto industry for at least the near future with lawyers representing bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital calling a proposal by FTX to offer early liquidity to Voyager customers a ""low-ball bid dressed up as a white knight rescue"" that only benefits FTX. Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this month. And troubled cryptocurrency exchange Zipmex said it has received an investment offer from an interested party.  A few up signs  Not all signs pointed downward. As CoinDesk Senior Markets Reporter Omkar Godbole reported, bitcoin's Monday plunge came even as Chicago Board of Options Exchange's volatility index (VIX), a measure known as Wall Street's fear gauge, slipped to 22.41 in early Asian hours, its lowest level since April 21, indicating calm ahead of the Fed decision. Meanwhile, layer 1 blockchain Aptos Labs, which is made up of former employees from Meta, raised $150 million in a Series A funding round that was led by FTX Ventures.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Eric Chen, co-founder of the decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange Injective Protocol, said that the Fed's likely 75 basis point increase had relieved markets who had been fearful of harsher medicine. ""Overall, the market is in a more optimistic spot than it was a week or two ago,"" he said.  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.

By Sam Reynolds  In 2021, when Coinbase listed its stock, the exchange described a distant but real threat in the form for registering a stock listing.  Decentralized exchanges (DEX).  Then, DEXs were a minor headache, a problem that could be ignored but not an existential threat. Now, they have evolved into something that’s scraping away an entire customer segment. Let’s consider why.  Declining value  Coinbase is cash-rich, has no exposure to Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital or Voyager Digital, and still is an appealing stock pick for institutional investors. Granted, its stock's value has declined faster than the price of bitcoin, but there are other reasons for that involving regulatory premiums. These aren’t the problems.  The current bear market means there are natural dark, stormy clouds over Coinbase: The enthusiasm for bitcoin at $21,000 just isn’t what it was at the base of the bull market in early 2021.  But even this isn’t the reason why there’s concern within Coinbase.  Equal volume  Data from Kaiko shows that Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, now has almost equal volume to Coinbase.  Coinbase does $1.2 billion in daily volume versus Uniswap’s $1.14 billion. Kaiko chalks this up to a significant drop in Ethereum network fees and the growing role DEXs play in stablecoin swaps.  In all, Coinbase was able to push $7.8 billion in revenue in 2021. Uniswap generates $534 million. From this, Coinbase has a net margin of 32.8% (which is still higher than Nasdaq’s net margin of 19.25%).  The gap in these numbers may appear huge, but the major issue is efficiency. Coinbase has a headcount of just over 3,700. Uniswap has a headcount of 53.  Although trading volume is getting close to equivalency, the difference in revenue is a product of how the exchanges are structured. DEXs must pay their liquidity providers that enable each trade to happen, from 0.05% for high-volume pairs to between 0.3% and 1% for pairs without the same volume.  Different products  While Uniswap is nipping at one metric of Coinbase’s, these are also two different products. Coinbase’s entire existence is predicated on the ease of onboarding retail investors and enabling them to trade. It does offer some advanced features, but it isn’t aiming to be what Uniswap is.  Likewise, Uniswap isn’t a user-friendly platform and is not aiming to take on Coinbase’s primary market – retail. It's definitely a platform for power users.  But if retail decides to sit out the crypto recovery, and enters the market trepidatiously, Coinbase isn’t going to see its volume and revenue grow. If degens once again double down it will be Uniswap that’s pushing more volume.  So on the surface, some might say the two don’t really compete. But it was Coinbase that wrote this in its S-1 form:  “We compete against a growing number of decentralized and noncustodial platforms and our business may be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively against them,” the exchange wrote in its S-1. “Such platforms have low startup and entry costs as market entrants often remain unregulated and have minimal operating and regulatory costs.”  Important events  European Blockchain Conference – Barcelona  ECB forum on central banking  Federal Open Market Committee  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Is FTX’s High Stakes Offer a Good Deal for Voyager?

Bankruptcy expert Thomas Braziel of 507 Capital joined ""First Mover"" to discuss the latest developments in the case.

415310,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496611,1658790048,Ethereum Weekly Exchange Net Flow Points To Growing Accumulation Trend,"Ethereum had been one of the largest winners of the rally that rocked the crypto market last week. The network had seen a boost when one of the developers of Ethereum announced that the upcoming Merge would likely happen sometime in September. It triggered a ripple effect that spread to the other digital assets in the space. But it seems Ethereum investors are nowhere close to being done, given the on-chain metrics from the last week. Exchange Outflows Ramp Up In the last week, large and small Ethereum investors alike have been ramping up in terms of accumulation. This shines through in the among of ETH that was recorded, leaving centralized exchanges versus the number that was going into them. The disparity between the two is stark and shows exactly how investors are feeling when it comes to investing in ETH. Numbers for the last week have shown that $3.3 billion total in ETH had flowed into centralized exchanges. However, the volume of ETH flowing out was about 100% higher. Data from Glassine shows that $6.5 billion flowed out, leading to a -$3.1 billion net flow. This shows that investors are accumulating by moving their ETH out of exchanges and presumably to personal wallets for safekeeping. It also points to long-term hold sentiment among these investors. Additionally, it means that the sell pressure that has weighed down the market over the last couple of weeks has begun to ease. In its place is now a high buying pressure, leaving investors to accumulate as much ETH as possible. ETH price falls to $1,500 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.comEthereum Merge Draws Closer The majority of the gains recorded by Ethereum over the last week have been attributed to the updates made about the upcoming Merge. Ethereum had gained more than 40% on the back of that announcement alone, but the price has not been the only thing affected by the announcement. The ETH staked on the Ethereum network ahead of the Merge had been on the rise over the last couple of months but witnessed a jump after the announcement was made. At the time of this writing, the number of ETH staked on the network had reached a new all-time high of 13,152,149 ETH, and this number is expected to grow as the date draws closer. This means that more than $20 billion in ETH is now being held in the ETH 2.0 deposit contract. Now, this is not the highest point it has been in terms of dollar value, but it is nonetheless significant given that the price of ETH is down more than 70% from its ATH.

413910,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496636,1658787525,The Inside Story Of The Roger Ver Vs. CoinFLEX Conflict,"The infamous Roger Ver is back in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Like many players in the industry, the derivatives exchange CoinFLEX recently ran into financial trouble. Surprisingly, they blamed it all on Roger Ver and the circus started. Luckily for us, Chinese journalist Colin Wu covered “the entire insider details through a source close to the situation” in his newsletter. However, as you can see, it’s an anonymous source. So, take the story we’re about to analyze with a grain of salt. The summary of the situation according to Wu: “On June 24, 2022, the exchange CoinFLEX announced that it made the decision to halt user withdraws, and the price of the platform Token FLEX subsequently plummeted, from $4.30 to less than $1.50 in four hours. At the same time, FlexUSD, the platform’s stablecoin, also began to de-peg, with prices dropping as low as $0.23.” The funny thing is that both entities were clearly in business together. On May 14th, Roger Ver tweeted, “Interest paying FlexUSD by CoinFLEX is on its way to being the default stable coin for the whole SmartBCH ecosystem if USDT & USDC don’t move quickly.” How did everything deteriorate so fast? That’s what this article’s about. Interest paying #FlexUSD by @CoinFLEXdotcom is on its way to being the default stable coin for the whole @SmartBCH ecosystem if #USDT & #USDC don’t move quickly.https://t.co/HG14Ik6U0o — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) May 14, 2022 Roger Ver Vs. CoinFLEX, The Play By Play The story starts with CoinFLEX announcing to their partners that they “opened a special account for Roger Ver.” The account’s characteristics guaranteed that Roger Ver “would not be liquidated immediately if it fell below the maintenance margin, but rather that he would be given sufficient time to make a margin call.” Nothing special here, the man is a high-net-worth individual, deals like this are a dime a dozen in high finance. As a guarantee, Roger Ver offered “a margin of BCH,” valued “at around $400.” Then, the Terra collapse happened and the whole crypto market crashed. By the time CoinFLEX ”faced a liquidity crisis,” Bitcoin Cash was worth around $120. It’s still at that price range at the time of writing. This is where things get insane. The biggest revelation of Wu’s story is at the end of this paragraph. “If that were all, CoinFLEX would have been able to cover its shortfall. However, prior to this, CoinFLEX had issued its own stablecoin, FlexUSD, like other exchanges. At this point, CoinFLEX used FlexUSD to buy a large amount of FLEX from the secondary market and opened short position to hedge the spot price. However, the counterparty to this short position was also Roger Ver!” As we’ve seen happen again and again, “when the withdrawal restriction announcement was made, CoinFLEX’s total funds began to fall in a cyclical fashion.” And all hell broke loose. BCH price chart on Coinbase | Source: BCH/USD on TradingView.com An All-Out Twitter War On June 27th, the company’s CEO Mark Lamb tweeted, “CoinFLEX made the decision to halt user withdrawals on June 23, shortly after a long-time customer of CoinFLEX went into negative equity. ” Immediately after, the rumor that Roger Ver was that “long-time customer” began circulating. Recently some rumors have been spreading that I have defaulted on a debt to a counter-party. These rumors are false. Not only do I not have a debt to this counter-party, but this counter- party owes me a substantial sum of money, and I am currently seeking the return of my funds. — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) June 28, 2022 The Bitcoin Cash leader went on the offensive and tweeted a statement obviously written by a lawyer. “Recently some rumors have been spreading that I have defaulted on a debt to a counter-party. These rumors are false. Not only do I not have a debt to this counter-party, but this counter-party owes me a substantial sum of money, and I am currently seeking the return of my funds.” How could those two statements be true? Remember that “the counterparty to this short position was also Roger Ver!” He had a long track record of previously topping up margin and meeting margin requirements in accordance with this agreement. We have been speaking to him on calls frequently about this situation with the aim of resolving it. We still would like to resolve it. — Mark Lamb 💪 (@MarkDavidLamb) June 28, 2022 However, Mark Lamb was not having it. Even though both parties were negotiating, Lamb took to Twitter and stated, “CoinFLEX also categorically denies that we have any debts owing to him.” Plus, “Roger Ver owes CoinFLEX $47 Million USDC. We have a written contract with him obligating him to personally guarantee any negative equity on his CoinFLEX account and top up margin regularly.” Even if CoinFLEX is right in this instance, did they have to air their dirty laundry in public? Roger Ver Vs. CoinFLEX, The Aftermath Back to Colin Wu’s newsletter: “In the end, Roger Ver’s position was completely worn out and turned into negative equity, while CoinFLEX was left with a lot of delisting FLEX. It was revealed that CoinFLEX had a real loss of $120 million, including losses from the de-peg of the stablecoin FlexUSD and the loss of withdrawals (less than $10 million) due to the collapse of the SmartBCH cross-chain bridge, which was built by CoinFLEX.” And the fact of the matter is that, even if Roger Ver’s debt caused this, CoinFLEX’s risk management team has a few questions to answer. “Roger Ver became almost the only counterparty to the exchange, and this only counterparty had the privilege of not replenishing the margin in time,” Wu concludes. It was an unfortunate sequence of events, but both parties signed those deals and both parties took to Twitter to resolve what should’ve been a private matter. Shame all around.

The two larger cryptocurrencies by market cap still record some gains over higher timeframes but seem poised for a dicey week. Related Reading | Bitcoin Puell Multiple Lifts Off From Buy Zone, Bull Momentum To Follow? At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $22,100 with a 3% loss in the last 24 hours. In the meantime, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $1,520 with a 6% loss over the same period. The crypto market faces some hurdles with this week’s public companies’ earnings reports. If public companies failed to meet market expectations, risk-on assets could resume their bearish trend. Jurrien Timmer, Director of Macro for investment firm Fidelity, believes this earnings season has been “boring”. So far, only 104 companies in the U.S. public market have released their reports with Meta, Apple, and other major entities still to go. In addition to that, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) could announce a decision on interest rates hike. Most market participants expect a 50 basis point to 75 basis points increase, anything higher in combination with a poor earnings season could trigger downside volatility for crypto assets. On the second week of this earnings season, Timmer said the following sharing the chart below: After all the handwringing about “the next shoe to drop,” a boring earnings season would be a relief. Q2 so far appears to be just that, with 72% of companies beating (lowered) estimates by an average of 4.3%. Only 104 companies reported so far, but it’s good start. Should Crypto Investors Prepare For The Worst? Further data provided by Timmer hints at an extension of July’s bullish price action for the S&P 500. This major index records a 16% drop since January 2022 and could trend higher forming a “risk rally” if “earnings growth” continues to hold. In the past months, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the crypto market have seen positive appreciation after a major Fed event. This Wednesday, the financial institution will hold its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. According to Timmer’s conclusions, if earnings remain “boring” the crypto market seems likely to push further upwards. However, the Fed might push down risk-on assets with a 100-bps hike.

42374259,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYBhB,1658786800,"Rate Hike at Fed's July Meeting Provides a Credibility Test, With Cuts Already on Horizon","As the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to announce an expected steep interest rate hike this week, traders in traditional markets are already preparing for a rate cut coming as soon as next year.  Most economists and investors believe the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee will raise interest rates by 75 basis points, or three quarters of a percentage point, at the FOMC’s two-day meeting in Washington, D.C. That meeting will be followed on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET by a highly anticipated statement outlining the decision.  Some traditional market analysts, however, seem to be pricing in rate cuts by the Fed coming early next year, ostensibly as part of a future move to stop the U.S. economy from a deeper recession. Those analysts might be thinking the economy is too weak to handle higher rates, or they doubt the Fed’s resolve to maintain tight financial conditions if markets continue to swoon, or some combination.  The futures market for federal funds on Chicago’s CME exchange shows that traders are pricing in an expectation of rate hikes through next January, but betting that the Fed will start cutting rates in February and continue doing so for at least the next several months.  Such a pattern would be similar to the Fed’s tightening in 2019, when central bankers first decided to take a “wait-and-see-approach” after hiking four times in 2018. The FOMC ultimately started cutting rates in October 2019 because of a slowing economy, admitting it was wrong about the outlook on the U.S. economy.  Inflation is still running at a four-decade high of 9.1%, largely a result of strong consumer demand resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. The Fed is trying to curb that demand by raising interest rates.  But this week could provide one of the most crucial tests of the Fed’s credibility if it ultimately ends up backing off from its campaign at, for instance, 6% inflation, well before inflation drops back to the target of 2%.  “If they go back into easing mode with inflation still at 6%, they’re pouring money into an economy with inflation at 6%,” said Bob Iaccino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank. “They shouldn’t do that, but they might.”  Decisions made by the Federal Reserve are closely monitored by bitcoin traders and crypto analysts, because broader traditional market sell-offs resulting from the macroeconomic environment have correlated strongly with movements in crypto markets.  Bitcoin fell about 3.5% in early Monday trading hours in anticipation of the Fed’s decision on Wednesday.  While a 75 basis point hike would bring the federal funds rate to 2.25% on the lower end, many economists argue that a more aggressive hike, for example 100 basis points, would be more appropriate and bring the Fed to where it wants to be, which is 3.25%.  “If you listen to the Fed’s own narrative about where policy needs to be, it's pretty clear that they now believe monetary policy should be restrictive,” said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. “There would certainly be a very clear logic to go 100 basis points, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's what they did.”  As the de facto global bank to the world, the Fed has to respond to conditions in the foreign-exchange market, which is why the recent decision by the European Central Bank (ECB) to raise interest rates by 50 basis points could force the U.S. central bank to hike more aggressively.  The surprising rate hike by the ECB put pressure on the euro in the short term, according to a report from Coinbase (COIN). It was also in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) outperforming many of the most heavily traded currencies in the world, including the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to insist the U.S. economy is far from a recession because of the strong labor market, but opinions differ widely. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Sunday on CNN that a soft landing is “very unlikely.” He added that “we do need strong action from our central bank,” but didn’t say if he thinks a 75 basis point or 100 basis point move would be more appropriate.  Some, like Ark’s Cathie Wood, think the U.S. is already in a recession.  The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is set to release a new report showing a decline in economic activity in the second quarter of 2022 as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP).  A popular tracker from the Atlanta Fed, the GDPNow gauge, predicts that GDP declined by 1.6% in the second quarter of this year, which would be the second consecutive quarter of declining economic activity, which is what most economists were taught is the definition of a recession. But according to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a declining GDP on Thursday won’t be a reason to worry.  “The Fed can’t say that they’re trying to push the economy into a recession, but in my opinion they are, because that’s the only thing that’s going to slow down prices,” Iaccino said.  “It wouldn't surprise me if they shocked us with 100,” he said, referring to a 100 basis point rise. “They’re trying to drive the economy into a mild recession and they know that asset prices are going to suffer, but they need that, if it’s in a slow controlled way.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/25/rate-hike-at-feds-july-meeting-provides-a-credibility-test-with-cuts-already-on-horizon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5a441ff5b587ba33a2764ff30e6b3d9b3b6f027-3829x2872.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374195,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYBN3,1658785831,Binance CEO Sues Bloomberg’s Hong Kong Partner for Defamation,"Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao on Monday filed a lawsuit against Bloomberg Businessweek’s Hong Kong publisher Modern Media CL claiming defamation over a translated Chinese language article title that portrayed the crypto exchange chief as running a “Ponzi scheme.”  The suit stems from Bloomberg Businessweek’s June 23 profile of Zhao: “Can Crypto’s Richest Man Stand the Cold?” But in Hong Kong, Modern Media ran a different headline designed – according to Zhao’s representative – to spur “hatred, contempt and ridicule” for the world’s richest crypto billionaire: “Zhao Changpeng’s Ponzi Scheme.”  Zhao demanded a retraction, called for the edition’s removal from newsstands and for a restraining order to stop the defendants from further spreading the portrayal. Modern Media has already obliged in part.  Zhao separately filed a motion for discovery against Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, claiming “defamatory allegations” in the profile piece.  There, Zhao took issue with the article’s portrayal of Binance as “sketchy” and with an anonymous quote from a trader that called Binance a “massive [s**tcoin] casino.” These statements “were obviously designed to mislead readers into believing” that Zhao was breaking the law, the motion read.  The dual legal actions continue Zhao’s aggressive image protection strategy for Binance. Binance sued Forbes in 2020 over allegedly defamatory statements but dropped the suit last year. (It later made a strategic investment in Forbes that was tied to a flopped SPAC deal). Zhao sued venture capital firm Sequoia claiming defamation in 2019.  The U.S. court filings underscore the extent to which Binance closely protects its reputation and how it is perceived. It recounts a back-and-forth between legal teams that resulted in Modern Media scrubbing the Ponzi headline and pulling the physical copy from print earlier this month. But “various online websites” were still selling the print edition, the filing states, prompting Zhao to go to court.  ""We understand that Binance has filed a lawsuit against Modern Media, a company based in China that publishes a Chinese language edition of Bloomberg Businessweek and that published a translated version of a Businessweek story that first ran on June 23,"" a spokesperson for Bloomberg News told CoinDesk.

42374217,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYBiR,1658785045,"US Stablecoin Bill Delayed, but Draft Language May Soon Emerge","A potential bipartisan bill to regulate stablecoins has been bogged down in negotiations, according to three people familiar with the talks, but lawmakers developing the legislation are considering releasing some draft language that may spur wider input.  With Congress’ legislative efforts, it’s common to see a fast-moving bill suddenly slowed down by debate as it gets close to the finish line. The hangups over this U.S. effort to establish rules for stablecoins – digital tokens designed to maintain steady valuations by being tied to assets such as the dollar – are expected to delay it until September, when the lawmakers return from their summer break, the people said.  Meanwhile, the committee is talking about issuing a discussion draft – a document that would include the legislative language the members are working on, the people said. That could happen much sooner.  The narrowly focused bill aims to establish a U.S. oversight regime for stablecoins, on which crypto markets depend to counter the volatility of more speculative assets. The bill is expected to set a path for nonbank firms to be able to issue stablecoins, though they’d have to meet new capital and liquidity standards. The bill would also ban commercial companies from becoming issuers, people familiar with the effort have said. And when the Treasury Department sought to expand the bill into another area of consumer protection, the negotiations slowed, one of the people said.  Stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC represent a relatively small slice of the $1 trillion in overall crypto value but are traded at very high volumes because they’re often used by investors to move in and out of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other coins.  If lawmakers from both parties can find common ground by September, Chair Maxine Water (D-Calif.) of the House Finance Committee can schedule a markup, which is an open session inviting debate or changes to the details of legislation before it gets a vote in the committee. She’s been negotiating with the panel’s ranking Republican, Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), and in recent days, the two have briefed the other members of the committee, the people said.  Treasury Department officials – including Secretary Janet Yellen – have also been involved in the discussions with lawmakers, according to one of the people. An administration push for further investor protections caused the latest rift in the talks over the weekend. The Treasury Department and Democrats added a request that the bill include safeguards for customers' wallets, specifically that their money be walled off from the assets of crypto platforms hosting the wallets. The Biden administration has been seeking answers for this consumer hazard since Coinbase (COIN) disclosed that customer funds may be vulnerable in a hypothetical bankruptcy and other crypto firms began freezing customer accounts as they faced their own real-world failures.  Republicans pushed back on that widening of the bill's scope and argued in favor of state-based standards for wallets, but Treasury officials have made it clear that the department won't endorse a bill without the federal protections, the person said.  If the bill manages to survive the House, the next hurdle could be Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. He’s been highly distrustful of the crypto industry, but his views on this legislative effort aren’t yet clear.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | USDT,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/25/us-stablecoin-bill-delayed-but-draft-language-may-soon-emerge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e19325b09959e704ac5291d716cd4f22e1fe7abd-5083x3812.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite the volatility this year, the long-term bullish case for Bitcoin as the leading cryptocurrency and store of value remains in play. A pullback in the Dollar strength may be a catalyst for the next leg higher in Bitcoin through the rest of the year. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and the broader crypto sector across alts, blockchain tech startups, DeFi players, and digital mining companies have been nothing short of a disaster. From the strong momentum for much of 2021, BTC fell nearly 75% from its high when it briefly traded under $18,000 amid the broader market selloff last month. Favorably, the trading action has turned more positive and we have several reasons to believe that ""the low"" is in. We last covered Bitcoin back in May, heralding the start of a "" crypto ice age "". While that article worked at the time, signs of a crypto spring thaw with a new outlook that this current rally has legs warrant an update. We Saw A True Capitulation in Bitcoin We likely saw a true capitulation in June. When BTC moved under $20k, the volatility effectively wiped out gains from any investor purchase since Q4 2020 when Bitcoin first took out the old 2017 highs. This is important because the move worked to wring out the speculative ""hot money"" into the sector while also consolidating positions into more committed investors. Holding ~$20k was a big deal with the result being that BTC has now formed a strong bottom of support. source: finviz As a recap, the headlines have been brutal. This year we've seen major crypto players collapse, including crypto-lending platform Celsius which at one time noted it had over $25 billion in assets under management. The brokerage platform, Voyager Digital Ltd. (VYGVQ) is another example of a recent sector bankruptcy . There was also the crash of stable coins like TerraUSD ( UST-USD ) losing its peg to the Dollar. In this regard, it's impressive to us how well Bitcoin has helped up over the past 2-3 months despite all these pressures. If the apocalyptic bearish calls for BTC to become worthless and trade down to zero were to come true, this was the time for it to happen, yet here we are as BTC is currently up over 35% from its recent $17,592 low and over 20% higher in just the past week. A report from Coinbase Global Inc ( COIN ) which said it does not have any exposure to bankrupt firms provides some confidence that the sector is ready to move forward and the worst days are in the past. source: finviz Bitcoin's Underlying Strength The latest feather in its cap is from Tesla Inc ( TSLA ) quarterly report when the company noted it had liquidated 75% of its holdings to raise nearly $975 million in cash to deal with corporate liquidity purposes. BTC continued trading higher on the day despite the report. The support of crypto from Tesla CEO Elon Musk was long seen as a major boost to the asset class credibility and it's encouraging to see BTC brushing aside this surprising turn of events. In many ways, the combination of all these developments and Bitcoin's ability to survive help reaffirm its more structural long-term bullish thesis. Fundamentally, the strong factor supporting an outlook for a higher price of Bitcoin over the long-run is its supply limit of 21 million coins, while over 19 million have already been mined. The reality is that digital assets and related blockchain technologies still have enormous potential which will generate an organic level of demand growth as digital payments and transaction volumes climb. Web 3.0 incorporates concepts like decentralized finance and blockchain platforms that are still in the early stages. Bitcoin here benefits as the ""gold standard"" of crypto as evident by its outperformance of several other high-profile alternative cryptocurrencies this year Data by YCharts As it relates to volatility, the moves are all relative. Considering Bitcoin's performance since its December 2017 high, nearly 5-years ago, someone loading up on BTC that day would be sitting on a 32% gain while several ""blue-chip"" S&P 500 stocks are down over the period. BTC has also outperformed most major market indexes since 2019. The aspect of Bitcoin being a store of value is still in play. Data by YCharts We See Bitcoin Climbing Back Above $30,000 In 2022 We are bullish on Bitcoin, but we don't see any scenario for a heroic ""v-shaped"" recovery. The all-time highs are likely out of reach for the foreseeable future but we can take it one step at a time. It likely won't be a straight line higher but we highlight 3 reasons to expect more upside from the current level. The ability of Bitcoin to weather the onslaught of negative headlines reaffirms the underlying strength of its long-term bullish thesis. Bitcoin capitulating under $20k suggests the bottom is in place with a compelling chart setup for continued momentum. Positive shifting macro dynamics including pullback in US Dollar. We like to use technical analysis in conjunction with fundamental developments. Ultimately Bitcoin will need stronger sentiment toward risk-assets to really build momentum and breakout significantly higher. We can look for to the July CPI report in early August that may confirm inflation has peaked and is ready to trend lower. From there, a sense that the Fed's strategy is working may ease up further rate hike expectations and support a narrative towards a macro rebound. An early signal would be a pullback in the dollar compared to its recent strength. This week, a key headline was the European Central Bank moving to hike the Euro policy rate by 50 basis points , the first increase in a decade. This is important because it works to support the Euro against the Dollar through a narrower interest rate differential. Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency traded against the Dollar can end up benefiting from USD Index weakness from here. source: finviz First, we note that BTC currently at $23,350 is trading above its 50day moving average, breaking out of a downtrend channel that had been in place since April. Similarly, the relative strength index (""RSI"") above 60 along with the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) momentum oscillator implies the bulls are regaining control. From here, $30k as upside resistance and eventually the $35,000 level representing the 200day moving average are the next targets. source: stockcharts Final Thoughts it's always worth covering the risks with an understanding that the segment remains speculative with ongoing volatility. A deterioration in the macro environment from here could open the door for another leg lower in BTC through financial contagion. There is also the possibility that global governments take a more assertive effort to regulate or even ban digital assets which would undermine some of the long-term bullish cases in crypto. Being a crypto investor has been tough, but the takeaway here is that calls for its demise and the end of crypto may turn out to be wrong - again. There is still a bullish case with significant upside potential looking out over the next several years. In the near term, the $20k range of price support will be a critical level to watch.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4525649-bitcoin-3-signs-warming-up-into-new-crypto-spring?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/412376.jpeg

42411439,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlNL,1658784076,Why Sports and Crypto Getting Together Is a Win-Win,"Cryptocurrency is the fastest-growing sponsorship category in sports advertising for a reason.  The crypto industry adds immense value for leagues, franchises and athletes worldwide. In turn, leagues, franchises and professional athletes are looking to connect with younger audiences, like GenZers and millennials, an elusive and critical demographic for the sports industry that crypto has in spades.  And so, sports and crypto tie-ups are a win-win.  Simon Yu is CEO of StormX, a crypto exchange that sponsors the Portland Trail Blazers U.S. professional basketball team. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Sports Week.""  Meeting people where they are  Globally, sports sponsorship is a $40 billion industry. More than $3 billion has been spent on sports sponsorships in the past year alone – increasingly by crypto firms.  It may not seem like an obvious place for audience overlap, but crypto brands are using the massive reach of sports to grow awareness of a relatively new industry. Through sponsorships – such as Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange's logo on baseball umpire shirts and in ads during the Super Bowl – brands can meet people where they are.  The crypto industry is seeking to humanize what can feel like a complex and intimidating technology to the average person just getting started. When a recognizable athlete endorses a product, whether it's Wheaties cereal, Gatorade sports drinks or a pair of shoes, consumers are more inclined to try that brand.  For people already using that product, their decision feels validated and, in so doing, brand loyalty increases. In fact, celebrity endorsement can cause the value of stocks to rise and increase sales by about 4%.  Winning back a lost generation  Likewise, attracting young viewers is mission critical for the major sports leagues. GenZers, having grown up during the past 15 years with a smartphone in their hands and continuous internet connection, are the prototypical digital native. They are avid gamers, social media users and crypto enthusiasts.  But only 23% of Gen Z said they were passionate sports fans. Comparing this with the 42% of millennials, 33% of Generation Xers, and 31% of baby boomers, it's obvious why the GenZ category is such an important one for the sports industry. They are the future.  GenZers are more likely to believe that crypto is the future. In fact, 94% of crypto buyers are in the Gen Z/millennial cohorts. They inherently understand the digital world and that a digital currency native to the internet, such as crypto, is inevitable. They see the old way as just that, past its prime and outdated.  In other words, by associating themselves with crypto through these partnerships, the sports industry is signaling they ""get"" the younger generation. It's a way for them to on-board the next fan base that is so critical to the industry's future success.  And athletes are doing the same. Too many pros to count are using crypto in new and creative ways as to grow and monetize their personal brands. They're using social tokens, launching non-fungible tokens and signing ad deals with the hottest crypto firms.  For crypto brands, the sports industry provides the opportunity to deliver a wider audience within the demographic that digital asset players in the space want to reach. When in sponsorship deals, they can be extremely effective in building and retaining customer interest, loyalty and trust. This type of trust building happens incrementally.  Your court  Of course, sports sponsorships don't come without vocal and vituperative critics. But that's to be expected.  Crypto is criticized for its environmental impact, and for the retail speculation that sometimes hurts small-time traders. Sports teams are sometimes called out for contributing to the mania around crypto investing.  Mark Cuban, the billionaire trader, crypto enthusiast and owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, responded to this in an interview with The Athletic.  ""Facebook, Amazon and Apple have lost more in market cap than the entire crypto market. A ton of tech companies have lost 80% or more of their value. I don't see anyone questioning sponsorships by those companies,"" Cuban said. He has a point.  Moreover, although it's not perfect, leagues and franchises do vet potential advertisers (i.e., reviewing company financials, conducting character assessments of those in leadership and more). At the end of the day, both parties want to ensure that they will have long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships.  In some sense, criticism of crypto-sports tie-ups is proof these sponsorships are working. They are a catalyst for a conversation, a crypto ice breaker. Like any nascent technology, there is a learning curve. That curve might be a little steep but it's a natural process.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Simon Yu,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/25/why-sports-and-crypto-getting-together-is-a-win-win,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12938a4434856484fac214525525daba1cd2a7b9-2992x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422659,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0oA5h,1658781532,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Starts the Week in Negative Territory,"Hi, I'm Glenn Williams Jr., here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  Bitcoin (BTC) declined 4.3% on Monday to trade below $22,000 on Monday. The price decrease is a retracement following last week’s 14% advance. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down 54% year to date.  Bitcoin has dropped five of the last six days on volume that aligns with its 20-period exponential moving average (EMA). In Sunday trading BTC prices advanced 0.6% on below average volume. The tepid move higher following the recent declines, implies profit taking by traders at the $23,000 mark.  In traditional equity markets, the S&P 500 was up 0.34% while the Nasdaq declined 0.26%. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is up 1.8%, while gold declined by 0.6%.  Ether's (ETH) price declined 5.28% on Monday, on average volume.  Other altcoins were in decline in Monday trading activity as well, with Avalanche’s AVAX falling 8.4% while XRP decreased by 5.84%  Today’s edition of ""Market Wrap"" was produced by Sage D. Young.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $22,201 −2.4%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,529 −5.2%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,966.84 +0.1%      ●Gold: $1,718 per troy ounce −0.6%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.82% +0.04       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

BTC Retraces in Monday Trading, Pares Gains From Last Week  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Recent on-chain activity showed an increase in BTC being sent to exchanges over the last 24 hours. Investors should note that the Exchange Netflow Total (pictured below), is an indicator that tracks net deposits on exchanges and compares the current figure to the average of net deposits over the prior seven days.  An increase in net deposits is often interpreted as traders sending BTC to exchanges, from which they can more readily exit their BTC position. We suspect that following last week’s 14% increase in BTC’s price traders began to take profits, sending BTC to exchanges to ultimately be sold.  From a technical vantage point, BTC’s price has fallen into a window between its 10- and 20- day EMAs. Given that the 10-period EMA crossed above the 20-period EMA on July 14, we expect that some traders may interpret this as a buying window.  However, it should be noted that in July, daily trading volume for BTC has surpassed its average 20-period volume on just nine days out of 25. In our view, there does not appear to be significant conviction among long or short traders at the moment. We expect that BTC prices will continue to be range-bound in the short term, with short-term support at $20,500 and resistance at approximately $23K.  Readers should note that our expectations for support coincide with the “point of control” value indicated (below) in the Visible Range Volume Profile tool. For context, the VRVP displays trading activity over a period of time, across specific price levels (via histogram). The point of control represents the price level with the highest amount of activity, and gives an indication of where a substantial amount of agreement on price exists.  On the macroeconomic front, we expect most investors will be looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments this week following the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) interest rate decision. As we’ve mentioned previously, our expectations are that the rate will be increased 75 basis points. More important, in our view, will be the tone of Powell’s speech, particularly as it relates to upcoming FOMC decisions.  Additionally, we will be paying attention to Thursday’s GDP growth figures, where the consensus of analyst estimates is for an increase of 0.5%. A GDP figure below 0.5% will likely be interpreted as bearish across both traditional and digital asset markets. A negative figure would suggest that the economy is soon headed for recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.

In the coming months, fans will also be able to use their Moments to win prizes by competing in official challenges.  Launched at the tail end of 2021, NFL All Day is the latest product offering from Dapper Labs, the same creators of the hit NFT Marketplace and NBA Top Shot.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  What is a ""Moment""?  A Moment is a digital video clip of an iconic play from a National Football League game that has been stored on the blockchain. Moments are immutable, meaning they can’t be edited or deleted and can be stored forever on a blockchain.  Like physical trading cards, Moments come in different types and tiers with unique digital serial numbers to guarantee ownership and authenticity. The rarer the Moment, the more valuable it is in the marketplace.  Read more: 5 Ways to Earn Passive Income From NFTs  What are NFL All Day Moments and packs?

Josh Gottheimer Proposes $3M Boost to Treasury’s Crypto Crime-Fighting Unit,"U.S. Congressman Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) has proposed an amendment to the federal budget bill that would give the Treasury Department an additional $3 million to fight crypto-related crime in fiscal 2023.  Gottheimer has proposed that the Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intellience – the unit tasked with overseeing crypto crime and ransomware attacks – could use the money to buy better blockchain analysis tools, provide officers with better training and add investigative support to the unit.  The Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence has been asking Congress for more money since 2021, along with several other Treasury units, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Internal Revenue Service, to improve its ability to oversee and investigate cybercrimes.  Gottheimer’s proposed amendment to the budget bill would offset the $3 million in additional funding from the Federal Buildings Fund, a unit under the General Services Administration that oversees federal office buildings.  The bill, which provides funding to the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and several related agencies, doesn’t otherwise provide funding to the Treasury Department or any of its agencies.

42421147,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWVZ,1658780704,Is FTX Proposal Offering Voyager Customers a Good Deal? One Bankruptcy Expert Weighs In,"Cryptocurrency billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s offer to basically buy out the insolvent crypto brokerage Voyager Digital is “incredibly opportunistic,” according to one bankruptcy expert.  Thomas Braziel, a founder of investment firm 507 Capital, said there are probably a lot of firms, and not just in crypto, that would be interested in helping Voyager restructure. On Friday, crypto exchange FTX and Alameda Research – two firms founded by the 31-year-old Bankman-Fried – offered to buy Voyager’s assets and loans (minus a bad debt to Three Arrows Capital) at cash value and open accounts for its customers on FTX.  “That’s a good deal” for FTX, which would essentially be acquiring customers at zero cost, Braziel said Monday on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program. But possibly not for Voyager or its customers.  “We haven’t seen bids from other players yet,” Braziel said. “The best deal is to try to be patient and let the bankruptcy court process run a full auction,"" he added later.  Braziel, whose firm specializes in financing distressed debt and participated in the legendary Mt. Gox liquidation, said it’s still the early stages of what will likely be a long bidding process.  Meanwhile, lawyers at beleaguered broker Voyager Digital have since responded, stating the the offer from FTX is a “low ball bid dressed up as a white knight rescue that only benefits FTX.” In response, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said in a tweet the offer is good and attempts to negotiate will likely hurt consumers.  “The consultants, for instance, likely want the bankruptcy process to drag out as long as possible maximizing their fees. Our offer would let people claim assets quickly,” Bankman-Fried said.  Braziel said other firms are likely to make bids above FTX’s offer. Moreover, Voyager has “a responsibility to market the assets” and weigh options to recoup any value from its balance sheet for investors, employees and its clientele.  “There are other people in the debt structure behind customer count claimants, including the equity holders,” he said.  Braziel, however, said he “doesn’t really support the plan” from FTX, which “out of the box” seemed to captivate customers looking for a quick pay out. He added that Bankman-Fried was overstating the idea that competing restructuring deals would mostly benefit the lawyers involved.  “The best deal is to try to be patient and let the bankruptcy court process run a full auction,” he said. “I think it's just a little short sighted to pick the first deal that came along that provides nothing but liquidity.”  Braziel said Voyager customers could likely expect “50 to 60 cents on the dollar before attorneys fees,” based on his reading of the bankruptcy filing.  At the same time, Braziel said he could understand Bankman-Fried’s strategy, which is essentially to acquire Voyager’s customers at no cost, but take on an “execution risk” in addition to a failing business.  “Crypto native” customers might also see this as an easier option, and may not be interested in going through a complicated litigation process, he said. “Let's just get the crypto back, let's get liquid and start trading again. Let's start DeFi-ing [and] yield farming again,” he added, speaking for a hypothetical trader.  As a debtor, Voyager has a 120-day period to work out a restructuring plan under Chapter 11 bankruptcy law, Braziel noted.  Braziel notes the bankruptcy process could be surprisingly pretty fast in the U.S. and suggested people could be reimbursed and “trading around the holidays.""

42411095,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC8Sw,1658777117,Introducing CoinDesk's Sports Week,"As Web3 has hit the mainstream this past year, it has brought sports and sports fans with it. Crypto companies like Crypto.com and FTX have pumped fortunes into naming stadiums and advertising behind home plate at baseball games. Crypto sponsorship dollars topped $200 million across the leading five pro sports leagues in the U.S, according to Axios. And that’s before you consider massive overseas markets, like the English Premier League in soccer, where startups are lining up to adorn jerseys and advertising hoardings.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  The crypto industry promises new forms of engagement, handing fans the chance to participate in new types of quizzes, challenges and experiences. It also promises big money. Socios, which is working with many leading soccer clubs, told Premier League teams they could make an additional $180 from each fan token holder, a huge sum when many fans are already over-extended in outlays to their favorite clubs.  Meanwhile every major athlete, it seems, from Tom Brady to Megan Rapinoe has issued their own non-fungible tokens (NFT). Though, as reported by George Kaloudis, prices for these digital assets have fallen hard during the crash, there’s no lack of enthusiasm: NFTs give sports stars another way to engage with fan bases outside the control of teams or leagues.  Projects like Socios – arguably just a turbo-charged loyalty rewards scheme – are a glimpse of what’s possible. More ambitious are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) for sports that could give fans a say over club management, player recruitment, the styling of sportswear and even ownership. Though DAOs haven’t yet bought a major pro sports team, there have been attempts (notably in the case of the National Football League's Denver Broncos), and, as Jeff Wilser details in a new feature, games like golf and yachting all have prominent DAO projects.  The big question going forward isn’t just how clubs and athletes can use Web3 to generate revenue and engage with fans. It’s what fans themselves might do with the technology to impact how sports is run. Few activities in life generate as much loyalty and excitement as sports. When participatory networks, like DAOs, harness that, the combination could be … game changing.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/25/introducing-coindesks-sports-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b42fb929573ebb383c77d06bf957c76f51d3e3e9-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Puell Multiple Has Gone Up In Value During Recent Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC puell multiple is currently breaking out of the historic buy zone. The “puell multiple” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the daily miner revenues (in USD) and the 365-day moving average of the same. What this metric’s value tells is how much Bitcoin miners are currently making compared to the average for the past year. When the value of the indicator rises, it means miner revenues are going up right now. This leads to miners becoming more likely to sell and the price may be called “overvalued.” Related Reading | On-Chain Data: Bitcoin Whales With 10k+ BTC Have Been Growing On the other hand, decreasing values of the metric can suggest the price is becoming more undervalued as miner revenues are moving down. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin puell multiple over the last several years: The value of the metric seems to have observed some rise recently | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin puell multiple was in the “buy” zone until just a little while ago. Historically, this zone with indicator values less than 0.5 has been a sign that the price of the crypto is currently undervalued. Bear bottom formations have taken place here. Related Reading | Bitcoin Funding Rate Remains Positive, More Decline Soon? There is also an opposite area, the “sell” zone, which represents values of the multiple greater than 4. Naturally, BTC is overvalued in this region. Very recently, the puell multiple has seen some uplift and has now just broken out of the green zone. During the past, this has usually been a sign that the crypto is now heading towards bullish momentum. One thing should be noted, however, that in the past a breakout from the region doesn’t mean a rally would necessarily begin immediately. There could still be a few more months of buildup before a proper run can begin. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $21.9k, down 1% in the last seven days.

407506,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=243840,1658775521,APE Technical Analysis: Will Rising Channel Break Above $7.2?,"The Apecoin(APE) price action shows a bullish attempt to break above the ascending resistance trendline. However, will bulls break the bearish influence? Key technical points: The APE prices dropped by 2.84% in the last 24 hours. The rising channel attempts to break above the $7.2 resistance level. The 24-hour trading volume of Apecoin is $429 Million, indicating a gain of 23%. Past Performance of APE On June 18th, the APE price recovered from the lowest low support of $3.12. The fight between bears and bulls was resolved by a significant increase that has shown 52% gains in the last two weeks. The price climbed above that overhead support of $5.58, suggesting that the buyers are looking for a second leg upwards. Additionally, the coin price has the record highest of $6.9, which could be the weekly high. Source- Tradingview APE Technical Analysis The post-retest rally accompanied by a long-wick rejection and declining volume indicates a loss of bullish momentum in the APE/USD chart. However, the short support trendline forms a rising channel teasing a potential uptrend continuation. RSI slope decreases despite a price increase, indicating an increase in the underlying bearishness. This divergence confirms the pullback theory expected. However, the MACD indicator showcases a solid bullish spread between the MACD and signal lines sustaining above the zero line. Hence, the technical indicators showcase a bullish trend. In a nutshell, the APE technical analysis maintains a neutral point of view and suggests the traders wait for price action confirmation. Upcoming Trend If selling pressure sustains, a slight retracement could likely occur, dropping the APE price by 12% to 15% and retesting the $5.33 support. But, the post-correction recovery could propel the altcoin to rise 40% over the $5.33 support level and then to the overhead supply zone of $7.3.

42411105,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC900,1658773614,Crypto Is Coming to Esports: The Games and Economics of Tomorrow,"Video games are big business. In 2022, they had sales of $200 billion globally. Esports tournaments, with skilled pro gamers battling it out for big prizes, rocketed to $2 billion in total payouts. Even watching games has become a booming business as Twitch said it racked up 770 billion minutes watched in 2022 alone with five months still to go before year's end.  All of that is a hell of a surprise to adult me.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  I'm old enough to remember when my cousin got an Atari 2600 with blocky little sprites bouncing back and forth on the screen. The only tournaments were my cousin and me throwing down on Tennis, which usually ended with me in a headlock whether I won or lost. Fast forward to college and the biggest tournaments were me and my roommates getting stoned and going to the local Kwik-E Mart to fight it out in notorious quarter-guzzlers like Street Fighter II or X-Men Children of the Atom.  In the early 1990s, Street Fighter II heralded the humble beginning of esports tournaments. The 1980s was the golden age of arcades but by 1991 they were already in decline after home consoles invaded the scene. Who wanted to pay a quarter per game when you could buy a console and play all night after your parents went to bed? But Street Fighter II recharged the industry, driving kids back to the arcade to see who reigned supreme in the area. Those college and high school battles blossomed into something much bigger as the fighting game swiftly created a thriving competitive scene, with local contests. Towns across America and Japan knew their top players by heart. A console perfect port to Super-NES only energized the competition because now you could practice at home for free and then race to the arcade to earn eternal gladiatorial glory as you battered virtual foes to a chorus of cheering kids.  But back in the 1990s the biggest tournaments boasted a top prize of only a few hundred bucks. Fast forward to today and you've got consoles selling 100s of millions of units, mega-tournaments filling stadiums and professional gamers (with adoring groupies) making millions of dollars. The top-five pro players in DOTA 2 all earned more than $5 million in prize money over the course of their careers.  As a futurist I've spotted some big trends coming long before they ever happened, but I totally missed esports going mainstream. It was hard to imagine, back when the only prize was your friend buying drinks that night because you beat his punk ass with a perfectly timed upper cut. I missed it the same way I missed comic book movies becoming the biggest blockbusters of all time, with the Marvel Cinematic Universe commanding $26 billion. As a kid buying comics with my allowance I just couldn't imagine any adult ever green-lighting those superhuman stories for the silver screen. I forgot that kids grow up and become the very adults who hold the purse strings. They end up making all the stuff they loved as kids into something bigger.  That's the key to evolution of technologies and a window into how they might evolve in the future: Kids grow up.  Read More: Watch Out for Illicit Actors Gaming Crypto Games  Max Planck said that ""science advances one funeral at a time."" He meant the young rarely convince the old to change and incorporate new ideas, the old simply retire or die off and the young grow into the people who are in charge. Naturally they turn to the ideas that seemed crazy or even dangerous to the people who came before them.  It's already happening. Mark Zuckerberg grew up a fan of sci-fi, reading Neil Stephenson's “Snow Crash” that pioneered the idea of the metaverse in a more concrete engineering form than earlier works like William Gibson's “Neuromancer.” Zuckerberg’s company, Meta (FB), is betting billions of dollars that we'll all be donning virtual reality (VR) goggles and gaming Ready Player One style. Apple (AAPL) and others are going the other way, betting on Augmented Reality (AR) and readying for release cutting edge specs to get us all hooked.  All of that will take years. The hardware, the interfaces and the games all have to catch up. For AR you need glasses that just look like normal glasses or shades, not bolt-on cameras that make you look like a weirdo in a bar or a stalker at the beach. Apple may get us there, with its legendary power to make impossible form factors work. But people underestimate just how challenging that is with Apple already missing expected announcement windows. It will take some miracles of miniaturization. It may happen sooner than later, with companies like Mojo Vision already moving to human trials of AR contacts ripped straight from the pages of William Gibson's “Mona Lisa Overdrive.”  In other words, we'll get to the metaverse but it won't be tomorrow. After the hardware gets good enough we'll need the apps that drive adoption and we'll need newer generations. It was hard to explain to friends why I bought the iPhone 1 when it basically just had chat, a calculator and maps but not much else. Most people didn't buy until many generations later.  But one dangerous idea is poised to change competitive gaming even faster than new immersive AR/VR hardware: crypto.  It's already happening.  To understand why, you just have to understand a little about why games and crypto have always shared a remarkably similar trajectory.  Crypto and gaming: an inevitable evolution  Crypto and gaming have a natural affinity. Both were both born as rebellious outsiders from the computer revolution. Both are controversial and have fierce opponents.  While video games have largely shed their controversial image, crypto is still a target of hatred, fear, uncertainty and doubt. The difference between them is mostly time. Crypto is a much younger industry. Its lifetime is short, dating back barely a dozen years with the release of Bitcoin in 2009. Video games go back to the 1970s and early 1980s, with prototypes even going back to the 1950s and 1960s. As the technology matured, it powered up companies like Sony (SNE), which took in over $25 billion in 2020 from its perennial console powerhouse, PlayStation, and the software services that surround it. A 50-plus year timeframe saw the games industry grow into the mega-business that it is today.  Read More: The Metaverse Will Make Gamers of Us All  But it's easy to forget just how controversial games were at various points in their history. Critics screamed that video games made kids fat and lazy while destroying their social skills. Worst of all they were linked to violence. Like the Satanic Panic of the 1980s revisited in the fourth season of the show “Stranger Things,” politicians of the 1990s and crusading lawyers turned on games with a vengeance. In 1997, now-disbarred attorney Jack Thompson went on the warpath, targeting video game makers with massive lawsuits. The Columbine High School massacre ratcheted up video game panic to new heights when it came out that the shooters were violent video games fans and Columbine families filed lawsuits against 25 game companies for supposedly causing the shooting spree. In 2022 the U.S. Congress proposed legislation that would make it a crime to sell violent video games to anyone under 18.  Over time, the tide turned. Throughout most of the 2000s, an increasing number of leading figures, like the Surgeon General, said there was no link to video games causing violence, instead the main factors were a shift in home life and mental instability. By 2011, the Supreme Court struck down a California law banning violent video games to minors as unconstitutional. By the mid-2000s, as hundreds of millions of people played games and didn't go on killing sprees, it suddenly seemed that everything bad was now good for you.  All of that is a remarkable turnaround. If it sounds familiar, that's because the history of politics is often the history of people in power reacting with fear and loathing to new technology, which happened with everything from telephones to steam engines to the telegraph, radio, TV and VHS videotapes.  Today it's crypto that's in the crosshairs, with Nobel prize winners slamming cryptocurrency, multiple governments banning or attacking and vocal social media reactionaries, and critics writing letters to congress to get it banned. But, with time, crypto will trace the same trajectory from hated outsider to mainstream staple. It will get more mature, faster, safer, smarter.  Its evolution will mirror the jump from 8-bit sprite level technology to photorealistic gaming engines like Unreal 5. Currencies will get built-in password reset capabilities, and stronger protections on wallets and it will get so easy to set up that Grandma could do it. It will get woven into those next-gen AR contacts and glasses so people can zip money around in the blink of an eye. Kids who used it on the Darknet or flipped it on exchanges around the world or to trade with their friends will grow up into the people making the policies of tomorrow and the video games of tomorrow, too. It's not just science that proceeds one funeral at a time; it’s ideas, technologies, cultural evolutions, law and more.  Increasingly, game designers will find crypto a natural fit with video games; the two have a shared history of moving from outsider to insider.  Today, most of the money that powers million-dollar prizes comes from crowdsourcing or small subscription fees that raise money to drive the tournaments. Crypto will make it easier to raise that money, with localized tokens generated by the games themselves or by large pools of games. It will also make paying international players directly a lot easier, as gamers from nations outside the modern financial system loop get paid without having to open a banking account and navigate the convoluted and complex system of today.  It's not hard to imagine rookie and pro gamers making a living, grinding through notorious loot fest games, like Diablo III, hunting for gear that they can flip on an open market or that pays them simply to play. Early players may work their way up or just get some summer spending money by playing games, the way kids worked a paper route in the 1980s to earn extra cash. Some will go on to be the pro players of tomorrow.  Inevitably, that will breed blowback and controversy, with new reactionaries screaming about whether crypto laced games have fair wages or are even a real job but the trend will persist despite them. Rewards are a foundation of game design and crypto can give those rewards real world value. Suddenly earning extra health or more magic potions or the new glowing frost sword of absolute power will translate to real-world wealth.  It would be nearly impossible to do this with fiat money. Bank accounts and money transfer systems can't take constant micro-payments or hold magical items without getting frozen in seconds as anti-money laundering algos and checks kick in. Money just didn't move that fast in the old world and the system can't handle the load. It's like trying to stick mag-level bullet trains on old steam engine railroads. It simply won't work.  We need a much faster and more fluid system with money that can zip as fast as light moves down a fiber optic cable. Small payments, coming fast and furious, hundreds or thousands of transactions hitting someone's account over an hour as they rack up wins and losses. Today, credit cards would cut people off in minutes and you'd be calling the company to unlock it before they just canceled your card a few days later.  Economically, it makes little sense without crypto in video games and pay-as-you go tournaments. A video game company would have to set aside a pool of dollars or euros or yen to pay people, cutting into their profits. That's because they'd first have to raise all that cash only to give it away, a bad economic model if there ever was one. But with a powerful chain or token they create and mint money and reward points and non-fungible tokens (NFT) themselves and that means they can payout continually.  Eventually, several chains that are dedicated to gaming will become dominant, with easy ways for video games companies to pay into the pool while generating a larger swath of rewards to give away in-game, which will move games beyond siloed one-off, single game currencies that nobody wants. Just as nobody wants to buy celery in the grocery store with celery coin and then switch to bread coin to buy a ciabatta roll, nobody will want World of Warcraft coin when you've got a general purpose coin that easily works across DOTA 2, WOWIII, Diablo, Counter Strike and anything else coming down the pike.  And, of course, so much of today's games are built around the ideas of special items. Armor. Magic swords. More powerful guns. Better super powers. Secret door keys. Virtual land deeds. That's also natural territory for NFTs, those much maligned, non-fungible tokens. NFTs are already taking root in games like Spinterlands, Gods Unchained and Axie Infinity. People can earn special NFTs, win them, flip them on built-in markets and more. Games like Axie proved super popular in developing countries like the Philippines where the local currency isn't strong and the banking system isn't trusted at a deep level.  All that is not without its problems, too.  Crypto has the potential to take ""grinding"" to a depressing new level. Grinding is when you do the same boring, repetitive tasks over and over in a game to level up and get to the good gear and make it easier to face the game's Big Bads. Add in earning NFTs or crypto payouts to grinding and suddenly you've turned gamers into virtual wage slaves. It's already happening.  Axie Infinity, a Pokemon-like game with breedable battle monsters, created a kind of digital serfdom, with rich Axie owners in the Philippines renting out their NFTs to players to grind for them. Then again, breeding digital monsters for fun and profit might beat earning your allowance or weekly paycheck through mowing lawns or getting a part-time summer job stacking boxes at Amazon (AMZN).  Even worse, games with actual money behind them present a brand new and lucrative attack surface to hackers and crackers. In March 2022, Axie Infinity saw hackers take the game for $620 million in crypto in a single, audacious attack. The FBI linked the assault to two North Korean hacking groups, Lazarus and BlueNorOff (aka APT38;. APT stands for Advanced Persistent Threat). Those are nation-state or military-backed hacking groups that have the time and money and tools to keep hitting something they really want until they get it. It makes them incredibly dangerous because computer security is often a patchwork of hard-to-secure platforms. In computer security, defenders have to play perfect defense and hackers just need to succeed once.  The attack itself was ingenious in its diabolical ingenuity. The APTs planted fake job ads and targeted employees at Infinity only, offering lavish comp packages. They even conducted interviews. One senior engineer went through multiple rounds of interviews and showed interest in taking the fake job. The APT sent him a PDF with supposed details of the offer but that PDF contained a Trojan that gave them access to his computer and credentials, allowing them to take control of validators from the chain.  The damage may kill Axie Infinity. They likely won't be the last game to fall until the technology and security improve enough to defend against such sophisticated attacks. But the threats will persist, as long as there is real money to be made.  As Willie Sutton said when asked why he robs banks, that's where the money is.  Powerhouse games with big pools of prize money will make fat and juicy targets for hackers big and small. A single breach could crush a game, putting it out of business almost instantly and burning years of development and marketing in a flash.  Games are expensive to develop. The free-to-play masterpiece, League of Legends, cost $12 million to develop back in 2008. Cyberpunk 2077 cost an estimated 1.2 billion Polish zloty (US$313 million) to develop. That's not even counting on-going hosting costs and ongoing development and support.  A single bad hack could wipe all that out overnight.  But on a long enough timeline, games continue to mature and so does crypto, catching up to its older brother. Security will improve. So will rewards and payouts. And it might be just in time for the Big Tech companies of yesterday to deliver on the AR/VR dream of an infinite and ever expanding metaverse, one where crypto zips around as native currencies in a digital flurry of bits and light and information.  The games and economics of tomorrow  The way technologies and industries can grow out of nothing into masters of the universe can take even the closest industry observers by surprise. Turn your back on a tiny niche industry and suddenly it's worth billions. That's what happened to games and game tournaments and it will happen to crypto, too.  I've got a long history of watching technology, and it follows that familiar pattern of hated outsider to boring mainstream mainstay. There are always people in society who fear what's coming. How will it change things? Will it make things worse? Will it destroy our way of life?  The answer is always yes. Technology changes things in both good and bad ways, always, no matter what it is. Some people may hate earning their salary playing a virtual game. Politicians will certainly turn on that kind of way to make a living. Social media pundits will scream that it's not “real work” and that society has now reached a depressing new low. And, of course, it will mean exploitation in some places, a kind of digital serfdom as people grind for money to rich overlords.  CoinDesk Podcast: Playing to Win: How Gamers Are Using Crypto and Where the Market Is Going  But at the same time, not everyone's experience will be the same. For some it will be a path out of poverty. In the developing world, where good jobs might be few and far between, jumping on line to grind for magic swords might just lift some kids out of starvation and struggling to keep the lights on. It may help them find their way to becoming doctors and lawyers and coders and other coveted jobs of the future we can't imagine yet.  Tournaments will get bigger and prizes will get bigger too as the pools of money increase rapidly with the rise of crypto payouts. More and more people will make a living in the virtual world and live a very good life in the real world too. It will likely be a life that's location independent and the envy of many other people who'd rather do that than hawk t-shirts or stack boxes in a soulless warehouse to make ends meet.  Technology is neither good nor evil, it's both and everything in between. Technology is not outside of us, it's a part of us, a part of who we are and what we want. What we do with that technology is what makes it good or bad.  The marriage of video games and crypto will straddle both ends of the spectrum. It will offer brand new opportunities and livelihoods to some, exploit others and make still others fabulously wealthy. If that sounds like the way things are today, morphed into a new mold, that's because that's exactly what it is. Video games intertwined with crypto will follow the same well-worn paths of the past but do it with a new twist, as it has with all technologies since the dawn of time.

406344,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496622,1658773459,Is Ethereum Stronger Than Bearish Macro Factors? Why ETH Will Be Tested This Week,"Ethereum has lost bullish momentum over the weekend and hints at a pullback in the short term. The cryptocurrency is still leading the current crypto market recovery with a 14% profit over the past week but might be negatively impacted by macroeconomic factors. Related Reading | Bitcoin Bulls Try To Recoup As BTC Dislodged From $22,000 Level At the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $1,530 with a 5% loss in the last 24 hours. According to a senior analyst at research firm Messari, the second cryptocurrency by market capitalization will face several challenges this week. As NewsBTC reported, Ethereum was at the heart of the current market relief rally. ETH core developers set a date for “The Merge”, the event that will complete its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The highly anticipated event will take place in September this year, but the announcement might be insufficient to mitigate current macro conditions. The Messari analyst believes this week will be key in shedding light on ETH’s price future price action. Since last week, major corporations in the United States have been publishing their earnings reports. So far, big tech companies have been showing relatively good results. In the next few days, Apple, Meta, Google, Exxon, Ford, Amazon, Intel, and other behemoths will release their earnings. If the results are favorable, Ethereum and the crypto market might continue rallying beyond critical resistance. The opposite will be true if these companies failed to meet market expectations. The analyst said the following while sharing the image below showing ETH and BTC’s correlation with the S&P 500: Eth correlation with stocks is rolling over. If we have big misses on earnings, a bad reaction to the fed and stocks rolling out this week will be THE test is the merge > macro. As the chart shows, ETH’s price has been decoupling from the traditional market, specifically the S&P 500 since the start of July 2022. Most likely as a reaction to “The Merge” announcement, this trend could reverse on the back of a bad earnings season. What Lies Ahead For Ethereum On the other hand, if companies record losses, the S&P 500 and other Indexes could trend lower and finally hint at a potential macro bottom for the multi-month bearish trend across global financial markets. The analyst noted that only 21% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported their earnings. This leaves a majority of this Index to determine the upcoming trend in legacy markets and the crypto markets. The analyst added: If big tech misses and guides lower we finally could see the mark down in stocks to reflect the forward p/e folks have been waiting for. Earnings est are still historically high for any period, forget one with a war, record high infl, a pandemic etc. Related Reading | More Than 57,000 Traders Liquidated As Bitcoin Declines Below $22,000 If Ethereum can go through the next week unscathed by the turbulence in equities, the bullish momentum could extend. $1,700 is still a major resistance point to measure bull conviction, if these investors can push ETH beyond this point, the cryptocurrency could be set to reclaim much higher levels.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-ethereum-stronger-than-bearish-macro-factors-why-eth-will-be-tested-this-week/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Will this downtrend crack under $20? Key technical points: The AVAX prices dropped by 8.24% in the last 24 hours. The falling prices retest the broken range’s resistance at $22. The 24-hour trading volume of Avalanche is $524 Million, indicating a gain of 15%. Past Performance of AVAX The recovery in the AVAX/USDT currency pair started after it reversed to the $13.79 lowest on 19 July. The rise has now reclaimed the $20 mark and, most recently, the $22.1 resistance. On July 22nd, the altcoin hit the highest level ever recorded at $26.1 and then reverted within minutes, displaying the long-wick rejection. Source- Tradingview AVAX Technical Analysis The current retracement may be due to profit booking by traders with short-term contracts, reducing AVAX prices by 15.3%. But, this retest phase, coupled with a decrease in volume, indicates that traders are more in long-term positions. In addition, the AVAX price is retesting the broken resistance of $22. This could be the catalyst to restart the rebound rally. The daily-RSI slope slid under the 14-day SMA. However, it is still above the midline, which suggests that the market is buoyant. Therefore, the momentum indicator supports the theory of recovery. Moreover, the MACD indicator showcases a sell signal with the bearish crossover of the fast and slow line. Hence, the momentum indicators project a high possibility of a price correction before the coin price could continue the bull run. In a nutshell, the AVAX technical analysis displays a correction phase gradually gaining trend momentum. Upcoming Trend A bounce back from the $22 support that was flipped could propel the coin’s price 26.2 percent higher and reach the $28 mark. However, although things are looking better for buyers, If a daily candle closes just below $21.2 will discredit the bullish view and send the AVAX price back down to $16.

The dilution could come at an unfavorable time for shareholders given that both stocks have suffered amid the global crypto price and equity market routs. Shares of Coinbase and Robinhood are down about 73% and 51% for the year to date, respectively.  “Coinbase and Robinhood, like their tech-company peers, issue substantial equity to company employees allowing companies to both attract and incentivize employees while keeping cash compensation lower,” JPMorgan equity research analyst Kenneth Worthington said in a note to clients.  Given the sharp drop in share prices, JPMorgan expects Coinbase and Robinhood to lower employee equity grants via RSUs, though it still expects “share creep from RSU issuance will drive dilution to a still substantial 7% pace annually in coming years.” The bank estimates if that 7% pace were to persist for five straight years, it could reduce the value of each company to existing shareholders by 30%.  As crypto and equity markets remain under pressure, many public and private companies continue to embark on cost control efforts. In June, Coinbase said it was laying off around 1,100 employees, while Robinhood said it was cutting roughly 9% of its full-time workforce in April.  JPMorgan has a neutral recommendation on Coinbase, and is underweight on online brokerageRobinhood.

Bitcoin together with Solana, Ether, and Polkadot were all knocked over at the start of the week. Bitcoin was off-course and shaved off the gains it made over the past few days which allowed it to get to its glorious one-month high of $23,000 until it plunged below $22,000 levels on Monday.

Suggested Reading | Cardano (ADA) Spikes 8%, Overtakes XRP In Last 24 Hours BTC Price Can Retest $25K In Coming Days Bitcoin has been steady and holding it at the $23,000 level with very minimal drop in prices seen in the past few days especially with the sellers dominating the crypto market. The crypto was able to successfully breach the ascending pattern and now retests the pattern’s resistance levels. BTC is now eyeing the next key resistance level at $31,300. The price could still hit the $24,000 level in the next couple of days, if not weeks. BTC recently slid into a downside correction. A break under the key bullish trend was spotted closely at the $22,700 level for the BTC/USD pair. The pair is predicted to suffer a massive drop once it moves below $21,450. If BTC cannot stay afloat or above $21,800, it may continue to drop. Support is seen to sit close to the $21,500 level. A close that happens below that may send the price way down or near $20,000. BTC total market cap at $418 billion on the daily chart | Source: TradingView.com Bitcoin Downtrend Due To Elon Musk BTC Announcement? The downward trend of Bitcoin happened last week when Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that he sold roughly 75% of his total BTC holdings. Bitcoin was pushing above $24,000 but the bears caught up at the $23,800 zone. The last high was at $23,744 before it retreated. Following a quick rally, Bitcoin sharply dropped to the $22,000 level right after it has outstretched above $23,000 as seen in the past week. In spite of the decline in the selling pressure, BTC was able to maintain its 6% gains from the earlier week.

42411443,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlds,1658768441,Why the EU’s Rushed ‘Travel Rule’ for Crypto Should Be Struck Down,"We appear to be reaching an end stage in negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on a plan to extend the EU’s financial-surveillance regime over the cryptocurrency industry. Alas, lawmakers were in such a rush that they appear not to have noticed that the hastily crafted legislative package violates fundamental tenets of the EU’s founding treaties.  Prominent within the package are new anti-money laundering and terrorism-financing rules for the crypto space.  Mikołaj Barczentewicz is a senior scholar with the International Center for Law & Economics. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Most notably, the EU would extend the so-called travel rule, which currently applies to wire transfers managed by global banks, to require crypto-asset service providers to collect and report data about the originators and beneficiaries of crypto-asset transfers.  But the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the EU’s highest court, is likely to find that the travel rule constitutes a broad and indiscriminate surveillance regime for personal data.  The CJEU has previously established strict conditions that such legally mandated invasions of privacy must satisfy to be considered valid under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Barring some fundamental changes to the proposal, the court would likely impose significant limitations on the travel rule, much as it struck down a controversial data retention directive in 2014.  The EU’s existing travel rule dates to a 2015 wire transfer regulation designed to prevent, detect and investigate money laundering and terrorist financing. The wire transfer rule is likely to be replaced by a new transfer-of-funds regulation (TFR) on which EU lawmakers reached a tentative deal in late June.  In addition to the existing obligations on payment-system providers, the TFR would require providers of crypto-asset transfers to collect information that would allow state authorities to personally identify both sides of a transfer and to link those identities with a blockchain address.  See also: Here's What Still Needs to Happen Before the EU's MiCA Bill  These obligations are general and indiscriminate, in that the rule would not make distinctions based on the likelihood that a given transaction is connected with criminal activity.  The TFR also obligates service providers to verify the accuracy of the identifying information “on the basis of documents, data or information obtained from a reliable and independent source.”  The scope of this obligation is vague, but based on the requirements already spelled out in the EU’s anti-money laundering directive, service providers are likely to require customers to provide copies of passports, national ID documents, bank or payment-account statements and utility bills.  Such data is overwhelmingly likely to go beyond just customers’ civil identity and will almost always allow for sensitive personal data to be inferred.  Meanwhile, Article 7 of the EU Charter grants that everyone has “the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications” and Article 8 stipulates “the right to the protection of personal data.”  A pressing question is whether the TFR’s far-reaching restrictions of the rights established in Articles 7-8 are strictly necessary and proportionate.  Defenders of the current regime focus on evidence that it contributes to preventing or prosecuting some crime.  However, there’s a basic problem in that there is no reliable data on the relative effectiveness of measures like the travel rule. Are these measures as or more effective than alternative, less costly and more privacy-preserving alternatives?  See also: Crypto ‘Gray’ Markets Could Be Unintended Consequence of FATF Travel Rule (2020)  One conservative estimate holds that compliance costs with the EU’s anti-money laundering regime were 120 times the amount successfully recovered from criminals.  The fact is that the travel rule has been imported to EU law from U.S. law, where the standards of constitutional protection of privacy are much different – a fact that would likely be noticed by European courts in any putative challenge to the TFR. This is why the court may be likely to find that the TFR lacks the precision required under CJEU case law.  But legal arguments about the financial surveillance regime’s incompatibility with the EU Charter should be accompanied with concrete alternatives to achieve the goals of preventing and combating serious crime that, according to the best evidence, the regime does ineffectively.  We need more regulatory imagination, rather than just mount a clumsy attempt to do “something” about crypto and crime without a serious, evidence-based reflection on how best to do it.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Mikołaj Barczentewicz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/25/why-the-eus-rushed-travel-rule-for-crypto-should-be-struck-down,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/17c7d13249ee86ee7f444540635c18ccbc543d2f-2133x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As expected, it has come with its own consequences for those in the crypto market. Most prominent have been in the liquidations, which have ballooned in the last 24 hours. With the most recent crash, more than 57,000 traders have seen their positions liquidated. Bitcoin Dip Triggers $151 Million Liquidations Over the last 24 hours, more than 57,000 traders have been liquidated in the crypto market. This has led to a total of $151 million in assets liquidated over the last day. The most prominent of these has been the Ethereum liquidations. Ethereum, which had taken the lead during the market recovery and rallied higher than $1,600, had led the short liquidations and now, continues to lead in terms of long liquidations. Ethereum liquidations alone have crossed $70 million in the last 24 hours and $20 million in the last 12 hours. Related Reading | TA: Bitcoin Price At Clear Risk of Sharp Drop, Indicators Turn Red Others include bitcoin, which has only seen half the volume of liquidations compared to Ethereum. In total, there have been more than $30 million in bitcoin liquidations in the past day, accounting for 1.38K BTC. This makes it the second-largest liquidation for a digital asset in the last day. The majority of liquidations have been from long traders at 63.96%.

So basically, while this is turning out to be a big week for the financial market, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the market would see any good price action. Bitcoin had also not been able to beat its 200-week moving average, and the resistance faced at this point has brought the price to a lower support point.

42422654,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0o9ph,1658768400,Chia Network Reissues Its Asset Token to Address Security Vulnerability,"Chia Network, the energy-efficient blockchain and smart transaction platform, will replace its 7-month-old chia asset tokens (CATs) with a new token to address a security vulnerability that it uncovered after an outside auditor detected potential weaknesses with the token’s standard, the company said in a blog post.  Chia will halt what it now is calling CAT1 on July 26 at 5 p.m. (UTC) after block height 2,311,760 and begin supporting its re-issuance as CAT2.  San Francisco-based Chia, the brainchild of BitTorrent founder Bram Cohen, discovered the weak point after the auditor, Trail of Bits, “raised a potential class of vulnerabilities,” prompting Chia to probe more deeply, the blog post says. Chia determined that while holders’ CATs were safe, one risk area was potentially significant enough to warrant the change to CAT2.  “It took quite a bit of digging on our part to get to a high degree of confidence that this isn’t just a window dressing level of vulnerability. This is a serious vulnerability. We should end-of-life CAT1, patch it and upgrade everybody to CAT2,” Paul Hainsworth, Chia’s vice president of product, told CoinDesk in a phone interview. Hainsworth added that the firm had installed a round-the-clock monitor shortly after Trail of Bits noted its concerns to ensure no one’s CAT had been compromised.  A number of blockchain protocols hire auditors to look for weaknesses, but token re-issuances are infrequent. Hainsworth said that as “an enterprise and institutional-focused blockchain,” the company has made security issues a priority and conducts regular audits of new releases. Chia engaged Trail of Bits, a respected security audit firm, in December, a month before launching the CAT.  Chia created CATs as cryptographic primitives that allow individuals to issue tokenized versions of stocks, bonds and other assets, on top of the Chia blockchain. They are separate from the Chia blockchain’s native XCH cryptocurrency. Cryptographic primitives are algorithms that serve as building blocks for cryptographic protocols in computer systems. “CATs are an artifact that are actually built on top of XCH,” Hainsworth said. “It’s a separate type of asset altogether.”  He added that the upgrade would not affect XCH, although Chia will ask holders to cancel in-progress offers to sell XCH for CAT1s, so they don’t wind up with “worthless tokens.”  Next steps for CAT token holders  The CAT1 end-of-life point will serve as a reference for re-issuance of CATs. For example, holders with 1,000 USDS in CAT1 in their wallets at the end-of-life block height will receive the same amount in CAT2 via an issuer, such as Stably.  Chia has asked holders to upgrade to a 1.5.0 wallet to enable the re-issuance. The company has created a website that can also be reached via the wallet to view historical CAT1 balances and compare them to CAT2 balances in the new wallet.  Separately, Chia has asked holders to cancel any offers that may be in progress  “End users should be made ‘whole’ on the CAT1 holdings,” the company said in a statement that will be available on the Chia blog.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/25/chia-network-reissues-its-asset-token-to-address-security-vulnerability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37ddb2d6c244e8825ea61ee4100b42f3af6008fa-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422655,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0o9xh,1658764436,"Tether, Bitfinex, Hypercore Launch Encrypted Communications Protocol Holepunch","Tether, the issuer of popular stablecoin USDT, along with sister company crypto exchange Bitfinex and peer-to-peer (P2P) infrastructure platform Hypercore have launched Holepunch, a P2P platform intended to allow developers to build Web3 applications.  Holepunch is a fully encrypted protocol that is designed to ""unlock global communications, empower freedom of speech and combat censorship around the world,"" according to a company statement.  The platform, which will move to open-source code at the end of this year when alpha testing is complete, will launch a series of peer-to-peer applications over the coming weeks and months.  The companies have invested a total of $10 million to aid with the development of new start-ups on the protocol. Holepunch is also seeking further investment.  Form a 'swarm' with Keet  Keet, a free-to-use video calling app that utilizes peer-to-peer connections, is the first project to be built and released on Holepunch.  The app facilitates real-time video calls, text chat and file sharing by using a stack of distributed technology including distributed databases, which users can connect to in order to form a ""swarm.""  A swarm is created by a technique called ""Distributed Holepunching,"" which allows users to connect to each other around the world using only cryptographic key pairs.  Keet leverages this technology to eliminate central points of failure and reliance on third-party platforms or servers.  Digital communication apps Zoom and Google Meet, as well as Discord, Slack and Telegram have all experienced a sharp increase in users since the start of the coronavirus pandemic as employers shift toward remote working.  But Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino said in the company statement he believes these Web2 applications are fraught with issues, notably surrounding privacy and use of data.  ""Web2 requires users to give up control of their data, which has led to the rise of monopolies and growing privacy concerns,"" Ardoino said. ""That is why Tether and Bitfinex chose to participate in the development of Holepunch and Keet. It believes that freedom of choice, communication and finances are the lifeblood of the future, and anything that will enhance those freedoms is worth amplifying.""  Holepunch CEO Mathias Buus, who has been heavily involved in peer-to-peer and Node.js ecosystems for more than 10 years, reiterated Ardoino's stance in the statement. He said open-source technology ""will play a big role in liberating communication channels for billions of people around the world.""  Tether said USDT tokens will be supported as the micropayments system for companies that want to build products on Holepunch.  Lightning Network comes to Holepunch  While the Holepunch platform is designed to be blockchain agnostic, it will integrate a built-in payments API powered by the Lightning Network, a popular Bitcoin layer 2 scaling solution that was conceptualized in 2016.  The integration with peer-to-peer apps like Holepunch and Keet, both of which hope to make an impact on a global scale, will demonstrate whether the Lightning Network has the functionality to operate in the world of Web3 applications.  The capacity of the Lightning Network has steadily increased over the past year, especially as bitcoin has been accepted as legal tender in developing nations including El Salvador and the Central African Republic.  According to BitcoinVisuals, there is currently 4,304.996 BTC, equating to around $100 million, in liquidity flowing through the Lightning Network.  However, while the Lightning Network serves a purpose for in-store merchants accepting bitcoin, it has struggled to have a similar impact with decentralized applications (dapps) as users often opt for more established altcoin networks including Ethereum, Solana, Tron and Binance Smart Chain.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | USDT,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/25/tether-bitfinex-hypercore-launch-encrypted-communications-protocol-holepunch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dffcb880e5caf54dd8b68324621b31ddc4ac13c6-3912x2934.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The filing elaborated on information and statements provided in Tesla’s quarterly earnings release and call on Wednesday.  On the earnings call, Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn said the company “converted a majority of our bitcoin holdings to fiat for a realized gain, offset by impairment charges on the remainder of our holdings, netting a $106 million cost to the [Profit and Loss Statement] included within restructuring and other.”  In its 10-Q on Monday, Tesla said it recorded the $170 million impairment charge and $64 million gain in the six-month period through June 30. Because it didn’t add to or reduce any of its holdings in the first quarter, nor did it record an impairment charge then, all those results must have occurred in the second quarter.  Tesla first acquired $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in the first quarter of 2021 but did not disclose its average purchase price. Later in that first quarter the company trimmed its bitcoin position by 10%, a sale that boosted that quarter’s earnings by $272 million. It hadn't added to or reduced its holdings until the most recent quarter, a move CEO Elon Musk said was taken to raise cash in the face of COVID-19 lockdowns in China, one of its largest markets.  The company did not reveal the selling price for its bitcoin in the second quarter but a rough calculation shows the average price would be of around $29,000 per bitcoin, helping Tesla avoid a much more substantial impairment charge. Bitcoin ended the second quarter at a price of about $18,700.

ADA has now outstripped XRP in terms of market cap with now valued at $17.6 billion and XRP at $17.5 billion. Nevertheless, ADA still suffered a massive decline of 83% from its all-time high in September. The upcoming launch of hard fox seems to be the impetus for the recent price spike. It was supposed to be launched in June but was postponed because of some technical problems. The date of the hard fork launch will be announced soon by the Input Output team. Suggested Reading | Solana (SOL) To Hit $166 By 2025, Despite Current Bearish Conditions ADA Trading Between Two Critical Levels For the first time, XRP was scrapped from CoinMarketCap’s top 5 list in February due mainly to U.S. SEC controversies and lawsuits. Now, Ripple has decided to hedge on Cardano. ADA price peaked last year which in turn powered up smart contracts on the blockchain. Still, ADA has a lot of catching up to do in order to keep up the pace with BNB that currently has a market cap of $42 billion. Cardano’s price ended Sunday in the red at -$0.005. It closed in red for the second consecutive time seen in the last three days. ADA price is currently trading sliced between two critical levels. And the bulls are trying to revert to the $0.64-$0.67 range. On the other hand, the bearish ADA traders are seeking to pivot and dispatch ADA’s price down testing the $0.395-$0.43 range. In 2021 this exact date, ADA price was at $1.22. The average ADA price seen in the past 30 days was at $0.47 which is up by 8.89% following the same span of time. ADA total market cap at $16.5 billion on the daily chart | Source: TradingView.com ADA Spikes By 25% In Last 7 Days ADA price spiked by 25% last week, followed by massive liquidations. While the price reversal pushed the price lower, the bears did take the blows while trading the coin. ADA ended the week in flying colors as it skyrocketed by 25%. ADA price also managed to maintain its price at $0.5. With that, Cardano outperformed its competition and now ranks as the sixth most significant coin in terms of market cap at CoinMarketCap. It has a current capitalization of $17.7 billion which keeps ADA ahead of SOL, DOGE, XRP, and BUSD. So, will Cardano continue to dash in the green light? Well, it will all depend on the condition of the crypto market. ADA traders are very optimistic and vested in ADA but apart from upgrading the Vasil network, the Cardano community is also weathering the crypto winter and economic recession.

399805,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496598,1658761095,The Metaverse; A Likely Winner in the Development of Tomorrows’ Digital Ecosystem,"The Metaverse will likely grow into a $1 trillion market according to a November 2021 report by Grayscale. With barely two years since the concept gained popularity, virtual worlds have become common amongst crypto natives, celebrities and big tech corporations, including Meta and Microsoft. Today, this nascent crypto ecosystem is touted as one of the promising niches, combining the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR) and Blockchain. So, what exactly is driving adoption in the metaverse? First and foremost, blockchain-oriented virtual worlds are perhaps the closest we are to unlocking the possibilities of Web 3.0, also referred to as the decentralized web. In this new paradigm of the internet, users will have the autonomy of control, enabling them to vote on critical developments based on an incentivized economy model. More importantly, the metaverse enriches the Web 3.0 experience by introducing a way for people/institutions to replicate real-world activities in a virtual world. A concept that will provide enormous opportunities for advanced interactions in modern-day work settings or casual events. Imagine a virtual world where one can move around as an Avatar or acquire property to develop and host virtual events, that’s the idea of the metaverse. “When we talk about the metaverse, we’re describing both a new platform and a new application type, similar to how we talked about the web and websites in the early ’90s. It’s no longer just playing a game with friends. You can be in the game with them.” explained Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella during a keynote address. A New Paradigm of Digital Interactions The world of technological innovations is ever changing, from the yahoo era to Web 2.0 and now the much anticipated decentralized web. Is it possible that future netizens will exist within virtual cities? From the look of things, it seems that globalization is not only a matter of connecting economies but also bridging the gap in social interactions. Well, the metaverse is gradually proving to be a perfect vehicle for the latter. What started with the debut of Non-fungible token (NFT) infrastructures has paved the way for development of virtual worlds such as Decentraland and The Sandbox. These two ecosystems were the pioneer metaverse platforms to launch and now host some of the most expensive virtual land parcels. In one instance, an investor parted ways with $450,000 just to acquire a piece of property next to Snoop Dogg on The Sandbox. While such an investment may not add up to most people in today’s world, it is certainly making sense to celebrities and creatives. To this end, we have more advanced metaverse ecosystems such as CEEK which mainly focuses on adding value to the creator economy. The project recently launched an exclusive land sale, featuring 10,000 parcels of land where the owners (creatives and celebrities) can host virtual events or showcase their work. “This is the first step to launch the first truly community-owned metaverse where creators get a meaningful share of their hard work.” noted Mary Spio, CEO of CEEK. For a long time, this has not been the case, celebrities and artists have often been limited by geographical boundaries. Additionally, Web 2.0 service platforms end up taking the lion’s share of a creator’s revenue when disseminated through channels such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. With the arrival of the metaverse, tides will gradually change in favour of the creators; no wonder tech giants are also trying to capture a share of this growing market. “Our hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers.” said Mark Zuckerberg in Meta’s 2021 Founder’s letter. Looking Into the Horizon As it stands, it might be too early to predict which direction the metaverse will take. Is it going to be built by centralized intermediaries or on decentralized blockchains like Ethereum? The perfect scenario would be a combined effort to create interoperable worlds but only time can reveal what the future holds. That said, one thing is almost certain; we are heading to an era where people will be living inside computers.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | ICO | MARKET,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/the-metaverse-a-likely-winner-in-the-development-of-tomorrows-digital-ecosystem/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Withdrawals were unexpectedly blocked last week by the Zipmex exchange, which blamed a “combination of circumstances” outside its control, including “volatile market conditions.” The withdrawal halt coincided with Bitcoin’s (BTC) multi-week highs exceeding $24,000.

42422661,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0oA7h,1658759702,First Mover Americas: BTC and ETH Outperform Traditional Markets in July Despite the Dollar's Strength,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  In today’s newsletter:  Price Point: Bitcoin trades down slightly on the day but outperforms traditional markets over the month of July. Also: FTX is planning to offer early liquidity to customers of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital.  Market Moves: Digital asset investment funds saw inflows of $30 million last week, suggesting investor confidence is slowly growing.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading down 3% on Monday as stock futures edge up ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary-policy meeting this week and corporate earnings reports.  On Wednesday the Fed is expected to deliver another 0.75% point interest rate increase as it attempts to cool rising inflation. BTC is still trading up 3% on the month at about $22,000.  Ether (ETH) is down 5% over the last 24 hours to $1,540.  “Clearly ETH has outperformed due to EthCC in Paris last week, but I wonder if it has now run out of steam since we tested $1,600,” Laurent Kssis, head of Europe at Hashdex, a crypto asset management firm, referring to the Ethereum Community Conference.  “A bearish stance is not to be dismissed for the next two weeks as the crypto market is still not out of the woods, but last week's rally has offered optimism to many retail investors,” he added.  Other cryptocurrencies were in the red on Monday, with Cosmos’s ATOM down 8%, AVAX down 7% and Cardano’s ADA down 6%.  In other news, crypto trading platform FTX is planning to offer early liquidity to customers of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital. The proposal comes two weeks after Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Lawyers representing Voyager Digital called the proposal a ""low-ball bid dressed up as a white knight rescue"" that benefits only FTX.  Across the Atlantic, U.K. bank Barclays is expected to be among the investors in cryptocurrency custody firm Copper's funding round this week, according to a report by Sky News.  Additionally, CoinDesk’s chief insights columnist, David Z. Morris, wrote about Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s influence over the crypto market and whether markets are still fazed by Tesla’s moves.  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Avalanche AVAX −7.2% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM −7.1% Smart Contract Platform Cardano ADA −6.0% Smart Contract Platform  Market Moves  Crypto funds saw inflows totaling $30 million last week, according to a report from CoinShares. The prior week saw inflows corrected from $12 million to $343 million, marking the largest single week of inflows since last November when BTC and ETH hit all-time highs.  BTC saw inflows of $19 million last week and ETH had inflows of $8 million. The prior week, Ethereum had $120 million in inflows.  “These inflows imply a turning point in sentiment after a recent 11-week run of outflows,” James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, wrote in the weekly report.  “It also suggests that as the Merge progresses to completion, investor confidence is slowly recovering,” Butterfill said. The Ethereum network’s software update knowns as the Merge is set to take place in September.  Digital-asset fund inflows are $294 million so far in July.  Chart of the Day: Crypto Shines Despite Dollar Strength  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin and ether have outperformed traditional markets by a big margin this month.  The top cryptocurrencies have chalked up double-digit gains despite the dollar's strength, deviating from its record of moving in the opposite direction of the greenback. The dollar index, or DXY, which gauges the greenback's strength against major fiat currencies, was up 2.5% for the month at press time. Still, it may be too early to say bitcoin has decoupled from the dollar. The 90-day correlation coefficient between the two stood at -0.65 at press time, indicating a negative or inverse relationship.  The dollar may reassert its dominance if the Federal Reserve downplays the ""inflation-has-peaked"" narrative later this week, forcing markets to reprice continued aggressive monetary tightening for the rest of the year.  ""Things have to get far more critical before that [Fed pivot] event occurs. This allows room for dollar dominance,"" Francis Hunt, founder and director at The Market Sniper, said during an interview with Real Vision Crypto.  Ether-Bitcoin Rally Stalls at Trendline From December Peak  The ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio is struggling to penetrate a valid resistance line drawn from December and May peaks.  A break higher may allow smooth sailing toward the May 11 high of 0.076. The daily chart indicators, notably the RSI (relative strength index) and the EMA (exponential moving average) ribbon, have flipped bullish.  Ether picked up a strong bid early this month after Ethereum developers announced Sept. 19 as the tentative date for the completion of the supposedly bullish and long-awaited transition from a proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

Note that blockchain-based web3 was designed as a decentralized version of the internet. The funding proceeds will be used to ""build the reliable foundation web3 has been waiting for,"" Aptos said. ""We are working with our strategic partners to identify consumer needs, and address them by shipping the most performant and upgradable blockchain technology."" Aptos Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Seeking Alpha.

He asserted that 75% of the company assets were still in the corporation, questioning why customers did not get any money back. He assumed the lawyer might also be trying to extort more money from their clients by prolonging the bankruptcy process. 1) Voyager lost customer assets, but it still has the majority left. Why haven't those been returned to customers yet? Sad facts from a bankruptcy process. — SBF (@SBF_FTX) July 25, 2022 Sam Bankman-Fried Complains Before paying back the assets (if any) obtained from Three Arrows Capital, SBF contends that the current amount should be returned to the clients. The FTX CEO claimed in a series of tweets that numerous bankruptcy agents were “bleeding the customer’s frozen assets dry with consulting fees.” According to SBF, the lengthy, drawn-out process during which the funds stay frozen results in the customers losing in a “conventional” approach before obtaining their assets back. “See, if a customer had 1 BTC on the platform, and BTC was worth $30k… and then it takes years to go through bankruptcy… what do they get back? 1 BTC, or $30k? Probably, whichever is worth less. So the longer the process drags out, the more optionality customers lose.” The clients will be forced to continue paying the Voyager consultants more fees out of their own pockets as the bankruptcy procedure “drags on.” According to SBF, the goal of the proposed rescue agreement between FTX, FTX.US, and Alameda is to prevent further money losses for the clients. He states that the offer would enable clients to “receive the remaining assets back immediately” without paying any fees or taking different haircuts. Bankman-Fried claimed the affected customers have “gone through enough” and should be entitled to retrieve their assets sooner.

Audius launched its mainnet in October 2020 with the aim of shifting the “balance of power and profits from intermediaries, such as record labels and centralized DSPs [digital service providers], to artists and platform users,” the report says.  The platform plans to distribute 90% of revenues to artists and 10% to node operators by removing intermediaries, resulting in a “decentralized DSP that shifts power, profits, control and governance from record labels and centralized DSPs to artists and fans,” the note says.  The streaming service said last week that it was offering a new feature for creators to monetize their content by allowing listeners to send tips to artists via its governance token AUDIO.  Bank of America said the music industry is ripe for disruption. Still, Audius’ adoption trends and limited music offering relative to larger DSP’s are likely to limit “short-term disruption risk,” however, disruption over the longer term is still possible.  Competition is an issue, as leading DSPs have built “economic moats” around their businesses by offering large music offerings through record labels and by leveraging personal data to improve the user experience, the note says. Smaller DSPs, such as Audius, are faced with a “Catch-22 scenario,” as user adoption is needed to push artists onto their platform, but it also needs artists to join to drive user adoption, it added.  The bank notes that while Audius’ platform has attracted mainstream artists, including deadmau5, Diplo, Skrillex and Weezer, its usage growth has slowed since December 2021.  There are also potential legal risks related to Audius’ inability to remove music that infringes on copyright that should not be ignored, the note added.  The platform said Saturday that it was aware of reports of an unauthorized transfer of AUDIO tokens from the community treasury after it was the victim of a hack.

42411113,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC9QS,1658758299,For the Fans: How DAOs Could Change Sports,"It’s the year 2036. It’s the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LXX. Patrick Mahomes, now 40 years old, is on the brink of winning his fifth title.  Three seconds left on the clock. The Chiefs just scored to pull within a point.  Now they have a choice.  They could kick the PAT, tie the game, and try their luck in overtime. Or they can go for two and win the game outright.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  What do they do?  Or, more accurately, what do you do?  Because you are part of the Chiefs DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, you are technically a part-owner of the Chiefs. You get to help make decisions. So you grab your phone and cast your vote: Go for it.  Within seconds, thousands of other Chiefs owners/fans have just voted as well, and the “Go for it” crowd wins 57% to 43%.  More from Sports Week: Sports NFTs: How to Get in the Game  Mahomes snaps the ball … and lunges into the end zone on a QB sneak. He wins. The Chiefs win. You win. Not only have your beloved Chiefs won the Super Bowl, but a tiny sliver of the team’s revenue has just been zapped to your crypto wallet – as an owner, you share in the profits.  Welcome to the world of Sports DAOs.  Buy the Broncos  In a very literal sense, the above scenario is unlikely to ever become a reality. It’s easier to imagine the Browns winning a Super Bowl than it is to see the NFL relinquishing game-time decisions to the fans. That’s more sci-fi than prediction.  But in a deeper sense, it’s also true that there are several Sports DAO projects – with millions in their treasuries – that have ambitions to one day own a sports team. Some are long shots, some are imminent. And if these DAOs succeed, they could revolutionize the very nature of what it means to be a fan … or even a player.  “Fans are clamoring for the ability to not just be a fan, but to also have a voice,” said Sean O’Brien, co-founder of the DAO called BuytheBroncos that recently tried to, well, buy the Denver Broncos.  Based in Utah, O’Brien owns and runs a few small businesses with his wife – a mix of real estate, apparel and payment processing. He also dabbles in crypto. In 2021, he was intrigued by DAOs, as they seemed like the “great equalizer” that could help the little guys compete with the billionaires.  Then he had a wild idea.  “We knew the Broncos would be going up for sale,” O’Brien said, given that longtime owner Pat Bowlen had passed away in 2019, and the team had since been run by a trust. “We were pretty sure it would be in 2022.”  So O’Brien did his homework. He knew the NFL and the Securities and Exchange Commission would be reluctant to acknowledge some goofy-sounding Web3 entity, so along with longtime friend James Wigginton, he spent months developing the legal foundation. (O’Brien has a J.D./MBA; Wigginton is a lawyer who worked for years at white-shoe law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.)  Read More from Sports Week: Micah Johnson: From MLB to NFT Superstar  Now they think they have one. As O’Brien describes it, the NFL officially acknowledges five different types of ownership structures: independently wealthy individuals, an association, a partnership, a corporation or the fifth category of an “other entity.”  They think the DAO can slide into the “other” category, because the DAO is a co-op. “This is a solid legal framework, Wigginton said. “Cooperatives have worked for hundreds of years.” Farmers use co-ops. REI is a co-op. When you pay your $30 membership to REI, you are technically a part-owner and you receive year-end dividends when you buy tents and skis and sleeping bags. “This could potentially revolutionize fan ownership,” Wigginton said, “because a cooperative – unlike a corporation – allows the users of the product to own the product.”  BuytheBroncos started with just O’Brien and Wigginton. Once they realized it had legal legs (they vetted it with more lawyers and accountants), they began making calls and invited other to join – football fans, Web3 folk and even former NFL players. They started to grow. They began to get some press. “We know it sounds a bit crazy, but it’s also a bit badass,” O’Brien told CNBC in February. “The purpose essentially is to establish an infrastructure so that fans from all walks of life can be owners of the Denver Broncos.”  Even high-profile fans began to listen. “I would be excited to be part of it myself,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said at ETHDenver in February. He acknowledged that the Broncos asking price (at least $4 billion) was daunting, but said that “if your imagination is big enough, then it can happen. And anything I can do to make it happen, I’d be happy to.”  Others felt the same way. Roughly 1,000 people are now involved in BuytheBroncos, said O’Brien – an unlikely mix of Web3 enthusiasts and football junkies. There are teenagers and old men. This has made it tricky to even agree upon a communication platform. “There are some people who don’t know what Discord is, and some people who [preferring encrypted channels] don’t want to use text,” said O’Brien. When they first launched the DAO’s website, the landing page said 'JERD,' for 'jocks and nerds unite.'”  So if O’Brien succeeds, would fans be deciding whether the Broncos should kick the field goal or go for it on fourth down?  O’Brien sees zero chance of this, and it’s not part of his pitch or his vision. “The DAO needs to be nurtured,” he said, and several times he stressed that the goal is not to give fans real-time decision-making, or to let them help draft players or run the front office. “At least for the moment, the DAO shouldn’t interject itself in day-to-day operations,” O’Brien said. “We don’t want to be electing Russell Wilson to kick the PAT.”  The same thing that user generated content did for e-commerce, fan-generated content can do for sports teams.  Fans might not be calling the plays, but in O’Brien’s framework, they’ll have more of a voice. They’ll have a “seat at the table.” If a team is considering leaving the city and relocating to Los Angeles? The fan/owners could vote that down.  The DAO could even empower NFL players. “We haven’t made it public yet, but we have close to a dozen current Broncos who have said they’re onboard with us,” O’Brien said, along with “a few dozen” former NFL players. The pitch: If current NFL players are allowed to own a sliver of their team, this will both give them agency and boost their loyalty.  “Players would greatly appreciate owning a piece and having a small say,” said Ben Garland over text, a retired 11-year NFL veteran and former Bronco. Garland has been helping pitch BuytheBroncos to other NFL players, and he says there’s interest. “Just about every player I talked to was excited about the possibility.”  Garland thinks that a DAO would “incentivize players both to come to a team and stay with a team. Which adds value to that team.” He cites Tom Brady as an example. What if Brady, through a DAO, had a partial ownership of the Patriots in 2019? It’s hard to imagine him bolting for the Buccaneers. “I would want to end my career with the team I owned,” Garland wrote, “instead of selling my ownership and moving to another team for the last few years of my career.”  The Brady example isn’t even that hypothetical. As O’Brien points out, when Brady briefly retired in February, there was speculation that he almost joined the Dolphins – arch-rival of the Patriots! – just to get a slice of ownership once he retired. “The man controls every room he walks into,” said O’Brien, but even a post-retirement partial ownership was “almost enough to get him to go there.”  But then there’s reality.  NFL franchises, of course, are not cheap. And on June 7, the Broncos announced they had reached a deal to sell the team to the Walton-Penner family, which includes Walmart heir Rob Walton and company chairman Greg Penner, for $4.65 billion.  O’Brien was not prepared to go on the record with how much the DAO has raised, but he acknowledged it was nowhere close to $4.65 billion.  The dream looked dead. But the NFL isn’t the only avenue for Sports DAOs …  Golfing and yachting  It costs $4.65 billion to buy the Denver Broncos.  But how about buying a golf course?  That’s relative chump change.  The average course costs $3.1 million, according to Links magazine, which puts it easily in the striking distance of crypto budgets, even in a bear market.  Enter LinksDAO, a group of 5,300 golf enthusiasts who are trying to buy a golf course. “We’re rethinking the concept of what a golf community can be,” said Jim Daily, the DAO’s founder (along with Mike Dudas), who views the DAO as a way to make the exclusive world of golf “more fun and inclusive and egalitarian.”  LinksDAO has $9 million in the treasury, according to Daily, which was raised through a non-fungible token (NFT) drop that sold out in less than 48 hours. So unlike the more quixotic quest of buying an NFL team, a DAO-infused golf course feels likely to happen. (Daily clarifies that they will not use the DAO’s treasury to purchase the course, but instead do an “equity raise with more traditional capital,” and that in a technical sense, the DAO members will not actually own the course.)  Read More from Sports Week: DeShone Kizer: From NFL Star to NFT Trailblazer  Daily, who now spends much of his time “humping around the country looking at golf courses,” said the DAO is an easy way for golfers to nerd out over golf. It’s a way to find your tribe. (A tribe that might now include … Bill Murray?) “If you’re a golfer, you play the game for life,” Daily said, “and there are so many different areas where you can really lean in with other people.” The community obsesses over things like the optimal putting technique, clubs, accessories, coaching and the best courses to play. Just ask any nongolfer who’s forced to listen to other golfers talk about golf – it can be insufferable.  Then there are the real-life benefits. Through partnerships with high-end apparel companies such as Holderness & Bourne and Devereux Threads, members get immediate discounts in the real world. Not just in the future. This is happening today. At TopGolf locations throughout the U.S., members get discounts on food and drinks. “One of our LinksDAO members had $2,600 worth of value in partnerships,” Daily said. “And this has only been around for six months.” (O’Brien has a similar vision for BuytheBroncos, which would give perks to the fans/owners: discounts on Broncos merchandise, early access to seats at the game and digital goodies in the metaverse.)  With the NFL, O’Brien has worked hard to distance BuytheBroncos from the zanier idea that fans will control real-time granular decisions. “Democracy doesn’t equal chaos,” he said. “Just because you have a DAO cooperative doesn’t mean there are 10,000 people sitting in the room deciding whether we turn the AC to 71 degrees.”  LinksDAO, in contrast, is leaning into the idea of fans controlling the decision-making. That’s part of the fun. Every question of the course’s strategy and management could be decided by the DAO. Should they redesign the course, and if so, what architect do they choose? What are the rules for the clubhouse? How much are the fees? In LinksDAO’s Discord, members are already brainstorming ways to give the course a Web3 twist. One inspired or ridiculous idea is to install constantly running cameras on the par-3 holes, and if you get a hole-in-one it automatically mints you a hole-in-one NFT.  LinksDAO is not the only sports DAO to embrace the more sweeping potential of granular decision-making by fans.  Wanna buy a yacht?  The sailing league SailGP, founded by Larry Ellison, co-founder and chairman of Oracle, is working with the Near blockchain protocol to offer the sale of a team through a DAO.  The average person can’t afford to buy a yacht. But if thousands of people pool their resources? Suddenly the barrier to entry is lowered. And then they can start calling the shots: Who captains the crew, how much the team should get paid, which sponsors to use, which nation’s flag (if any) should unfurl from the boat and how to upgrade and tweak the yacht. The DAO could pick the sponsorships. “Do you want, for example, Philip Morris on the boat? You might not, and you can have a say in that,” said Chris Ghent, global head of brand strategy and partnerships at the Near Foundation.  Then the DAO could make even more granular decisions. Ghent says that in every sailing race, each day, the boats provide 8 billion data points that can be analyzed. This fire hose of data includes second-by-second variables like wind speeds, crew decisions and pressure on the trampoline. The DAO could monitor and react to this data in real time. “When you think about the ability to swap players out, is that possible? Absolutely,” said Ghent. Or perhaps the DAO makes a snap-decision vote on what the crew should do, and then that’s an “advisory” input that’s shared with the coach. All of these scenarios are up to the discretion of the DAO.  Ghent says that SailGP has worked with lawyers at Proskauer Rose to hammer out the legal framework. “We’re only months away from the beginning of this,” said Ghent, who predicts that a DAO-owned yacht will enter the waters in 2023.  The SailGP DAO, like LinksDAO, feels imminent. But there’s one SportsDAO that’s already up and running.  Ball Hogs  The pseudonymous “Flex Chapman” is a 30-something software engineer who’s a lifelong basketball fan and player; he once played in the AAU against the likes of Kevin Durant and Dwight Howard. (He clarifies that he “didn’t stand a chance” of playing in the NBA.) In May of 2021, purely as an experiment, Chapman decided to launch “Krause DAO,” with the name a cheeky reference to longtime former Bulls’ General Manager Jerry Krause.  Krause DAO had a simple goal: “We’re a community of hoop fanatics crazy enough to buy an NBA team.” As Chapman wrote in the project’s white paper (or “hype paper”), “Team ownership shouldn’t be limited to a handful of billionaires, but rather a movement of individuals that want to be a part of the greatest professional league in the world.”  Then Chapman articulates the logic that undergirds all of these Sports DAOs: “Fans breed life to the organizations in which they attach, so isn't it reasonable to accept a shared portion of the ownership and upside? We don't think it's merely acceptable, but mandatory.”  The growth rate of these DAOs is astonishing, even by the standards of crypto. When I first wrote about DAOs in the fall of 2021 (reporting on how the exchange ShapeShift had converted into a DAO), I first noticed KrauseDAO and dismissed it as a joke; at the time it only had 392 members. Mea culpa. KrauseDAO’s membership has swelled to 7,000. Thanks to a lucrative NFT sale, it now has a treasury of more than $4 million.  It’s going to happen. Someone’s going to do it.  It costs a lot more than $4 million, of course, to purchase an NBA team. (In 2019, the Brooklyn Nets sold for $3.3 billion.) But KrauseDAO actually owns a basketball team. The DAO purchased a team called the “Ball Hogs,” which plays in a more casual three-on-three league, the “Big 3,” that was founded by Ice Cube.  Podcast: Taking the NBA to the Next Level With DAO Ownership  The Big 3 is entertaining. It’s packed with former NBA All-Stars (like Joe Johnson and Baron Davis) and has a 4-point shot. Big 3’s motto is “we’re changing the game,” which makes it the ideal testing ground for a Sports DAO.  KrauseDAO has already put the collective hive to use, such as sending a scouting report to their coach, NBA Hall of Famer Rick Barry, breaking down their upcoming opponent’s strengths (including rebounds per game, steals and blocks per game) and weaknesses (such as 3-point shooting). “Thanks for the breakdown,” Barry texted back. “This is very helpful.”  “We want to add value not only to the team, but also the players,” Chapman said. This could mean getting them new sponsorships. Chapman said that when power forward Stacy Davis casually mentioned he enjoys Lara protein bars, the members of KrauseDAO used their connections and landed him a sponsorship deal.  But Chapman realizes there are limits to what the DAO can realistically do. When he first hatched the idea, his “little kid brain” loved the idea of fans getting to act as general managers who signed and cut players, made all the roster decisions and commanded the draft-night “war room.”  The more Chapman dug into what actually happens at NBA front offices, he realized that a general manager’s job is “way more high-touch and about personal relationships than one would think.” That was “a bummer to hear.”  But there are other ways that a DAO-infused fanbase can contribute. The way that NBA teams scout for international players, Chapman said, is still at times rudimentary, or “a lot like scouting in the 70s,” where it’s simply impossible to canvas the entire globe for talent. Teams have finite budgets. What if you could tap into a network of amateur scouts that’s free, decentralized and able to reach even the most remote gyms in Cambodia? “We could have people all over the world,” said Chapman. Even if these are not professionally trained scouts, at the very least they could record footage of the games, or perhaps take notes on players’ body language. Chapman said he described this idea to an NBA executive and “their eyes widened.”  DAO fan/owners could bring a team more content. “The same thing that user generated content did for e-commerce, fan-generated content can do for sports teams,” Chapman said. “Every team should be their own Bleacher Report, or be their own ESPN.” The reason this doesn’t happen now, he said, is because teams lack the bandwidth; some front offices employ only seven people. They’re all busy and they might not have time to launch a new media vertical. “There’s no reason why the Warriors shouldn’t have four podcasts, three YouTube channels, and a TikTok account,” Chapman said. A DAO could organize its energy and help make that happen.  On a more philosophical note, Chapman sees the DAO as a way to empower the fan. To give them agency. “Fans are like the atomic unit of the NBA,” he said. Fans are the reasons the stadium is so big. Fans are why franchises are worth billions of dollars. “Fans are why the NBA is in business, but they are typically viewed as fungible assets,” he said. “Everyone is wearing the same colors in the stadium. They come and clap for an hour or two and they go home.”  Chapman considers the historic model of fandom as “value extractive” – fans are just leeched as consumers of popcorn and jerseys and ticket sales. But they have more to offer. “There’s this nuclear energy sitting in the stadium,” said Chapman. “The people who are going to the games are lawyers and marketers and software engineers.” With the DAO, fans can harness their abilities to help the team win. “Our goal is to build that conduit,” he noted. This conduit would help fans contribute to their team not just financially, but through their own work and creativity, “to help them win more games and more championships.”  ‘It’s going to happen’  It does not, as of this writing, appear that Sean O’Brien will miraculously pony up $4.6 billion dollars to buy the Broncos.  But there’s a twist to this story. BuytheBroncos does not need to purchase 100% of a team to succeed. Raising $4.6 billion might be a stretch, but what about $460 million, or enough to snag a 10% slice? Or even $230 million for a 5% chunk? Given that the ConstitutionDAO raised $47 million in seven days, a sum of $230 million is not inconceivable.  This has not been reported by the press (to my knowledge), but BuytheBroncos has quietly been meeting with the other suitors of the Broncos, hoping to join their bid as a minority partner. What if the combination of Suitor B and BuytheBroncos DAO could outbid the Walton family?  That was O’Brien’s hope. “Being pragmatic, the better play was to align ourselves with these other bidders,” he said. He was surprised by the June 7 announcement that the Broncos were selling to the Walton-Penner family. He thought the bidding process would last for another few weeks, and he had planned to use that time to “hit the green button” and go more public to raise capital. “Until we could confidently say that we had an agreement in place to be a partial owner, we wanted to hold off on the public side of the raise,” said O’Brien.  The idea of the DAO as a “partial NFL owner” might be less colorful than you calling the Chiefs’ play at the end of the Super Bowl, but it still has the potential to revolutionize the NFL, or at least NFL fandom. And the idea might even be embraced by unlikely allies: NFL owners.  True, it’s hard to imagine NFL owners – a group of wealthy old men – caring about the decentralized principles of Web3. But it’s easy to see them caring about money. A lot of money. As O’Brien sees it, if Jerry Jones wanted to open up, say, a 20% ownership stake to a Cowboys DAO, “he would put $2 billion in his pocket overnight, and he would have the most rabidly loyal fans.”  Or look at the Green Bay Packers. They are the only team in the league that’s owned by the fans: 360,584 stockholders. It can’t be a coincidence that this is one of the most loyal fan bases in the NFL, even if all the “owners” can really do is proudly hang stock certificates on the wall. “The sun will explode and life on Earth will cease to exist before the Green Bay Packers move out of Green Bay,” O’Brien said. “That’s how all teams should be, essentially. Every current owner could open up 10%, 15% or 20% of their ownership stake, put immediate liquidity in their pocket, and become gods in their respective cities.”  This is why even if O’Brien fails in the bid to outright buy the Broncos – that seems inevitable – he’s confident that the framework of a DAO is so logical, so compelling and so lucrative that it’s bound to catch on somewhere. Teams from “every major sports league in this country have reached out to us,” said O’Brien. “That includes the MLB, NHL, NBA and the MLS, in addition to the NFL.”  O’Brien knew that buying the Broncos was a long shot. He knew that by “going first” he faced stiff resistance. “It’s kind of like how the first person through the door always gets shot,” he said. “We knew we were going to get shot in a lot of ways.” But he’s confident that the DAO can be a blueprint for the future. Maybe for another NFL team. Maybe for the NBA.  “It’s going to happen,” O’Brien said. “Someone’s going to do it.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/25/for-the-fans-how-daos-could-change-sports,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/397eb840a870e57f647d386a70d7a47f1f333eee-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But unfortunately, XRP saw a sharp decline at the start of the new trading week. Since it could not reach $0.4 levels, the current market movement had little effect on the price of XRP.

Fulfilling the Lambo Dream via Crypto Crypto profits have boosted supercar ownership, particularly Lamborghinis, a car popular among crypto bros to denote as a status symbol to prove their success in the crypto world. Research suggests that ownership of luxury cars in the United Kingdom has jumped up from 15,229 vehicles in 2020 to a record 18,186 in 2021, according to data shared with City A.M. In addition to crypto profits, the combination of a sharply recovering post-Pandemic economy and low-interest rates have also boosted ownership of these cars. Additionally, there are also reports of many fraudulently spending money from Government-backed CBILS and BBLS loans on supercars for themselves. Notably, some high-net-worth individuals were able to buy these supercars with the increased savings brought on by cost-cuttings from travel and leisure during the lockdown. Commenting on the development, David Kendrick, partner at UHY Hacker Young, the country’s top chartered accountant company, said: “After a very difficult pandemic period, a lot of wealthy individuals treated themselves to a supercar last year. The wash of money from the government and central banks into the economy has inadvertently helped supercar sales in unexpected ways such as ‘overnight’ cryptocurrency millionaires and extremely low cost finance for supercars.” “Ferrari remains the biggest selling supercar, but Lamborghini is quickly becoming the supercar of choice among crypto investors,” he added.

Morgan","Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ) stock is dropping 2.0% and Robinhood Markets ( NASDAQ: HOOD ) shares are slipping 0.6% in Monday premarket trading after J.P. Morgan analyst Kenneth Worthington calculated that the companies' declining stock prices could increase share dilution by 7% annually in coming years. In the past year, Coinbase ( COIN ) stock has dropped 69% and Robinhood ( HOOD ) plunged 74% as seen in this chart . Like their tech peers, both companies issue substantial equity in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees as a way to incentivize their staff while keeping cash compensation lower, the analyst wrote in a note to clients. With both stocks falling in the past year, that would force Coinbase ( COIN ) and Robinhood ( HOOD ) to issue even more shares to provide the same amount of value to employees. When companies issue or sell more shares and share equivalents, the larger number of shares outstanding reduces existing holders' percentage stakes in the company, a dynamic known as dilution. At current stock prices, ""the value granted historically could drive 10%-15% annual dilution,"" Worthington said. But he expects both to reduce the equity granted to employees in the form of RSUs. ""We estimate the level of share issuance and dilution would reduce the value of each company to existing shareholders by 30% were 7% dilution to persist for five consecutive years,"" the analyst said. The note likely isn't the only reason that Coinbase ( COIN ) is dropping. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is falling 2.3% on Monday, slipping below $22K. J.P.

SEBA Bank Goes On A Hiring Spree According to a Bloomberg report from today, SEBA Bank AG is looking to increase its workforce in Hong Kong and Singapore to more than 20 staff from its current seven people, adding legal, compliance, and relationship manager staff. Additionally, the bank is also seeking licenses in both cities, according to Eugene Sun, the bank’s head of corporate development for Asia told the publication. On being asked, what makes them go on a hiring spree amid the recent slumping markets, Sun replies: “We are finding the selloff to provide an opportunity commercially and in the war for talent, as clients and talent alike seek a more secure and more regulated platform for the promising future of digital assets.” SEBA Bank looking to establish itself in Hong Kong and Singapore is a considerable choice. For instance, the Singapore government recently expressed its intention to broaden the scope of cryptocurrency regulations. It is likely that the revised rule will further restrict retail investors’ access to crypto and widen the ambit of restrictions.

Singapore-based Zipmex announced via its Twitter account on Sunday that its ""conversations with various interested parties have progressed significantly.""  ""One of those parties has offered terms in an MOU, which includes confidentiality obligations so as to be able to commence due diligence,"" Zipmex said, referring to a ""memorandum of understanding"" agreement.  CoinDesk understands that Zipmex is seeking offers for investment, as opposed to a buyout.  Last week, CoinDesk reported that Zipmex was facing losses on loans lent to Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance. Babel froze withdrawals in mid-June amid the sharp downturn in the crypto market that triggered a flurry of liquidations defaults relating to overleveraged firms like Three Arrows Capital and Celsius Network.  The company is owed a net $48 million by Babel Finance and $5 million by Celsius, Zipmex said in a statement on its website.  Zipmex had previously blocked users from taking direct custody of their coins because of volatile market conditions, the same step taken by Babel and Celsius.

The hacker claimed that the Audius community had accepted the transfer of 18 million AUDIO tokens from the community treasury. Using the smart contract function “initialize,” he declared himself the contract’s sole guardian. To save additional money from the community treasury from being lost, Audius initially suspended smart contracts and AUDIO tokens. They were able to restore smart contract functionality quickly. Both the foundation treasury and the community treasury are secure repositories for money. The firm declared that it would probably publish a thorough post-mortem tomorrow. The $AUDIO token is fully functional once again. Remaining smart contract functionality is being unpaused after thorough examination / mitigation of the vulnerability. Thank you all for your patience and understanding. Full post-mortem likely to come tomorrow. — Audius 🎧 (@AudiusProject) July 24, 2022 Hacker Lowers the Price of AUDIO The hacker stole 18 million tokens worth $6 million and sold them for $1.08 million on the decentralized market Uniswap, which led to a drop in the value of the AUDIO token. Slippage, which can state as a percentage or a dollar amount, is the discrepancy between the predicted price of a token and the price at the time the order executes. One investor offered a buyback to avoid a selloff that would further push the price down. Another investor gave Audius the following request: recover or get out. Initial research by blockchain security firm Peckshield identified an inconsistent storage arrangement as the issue’s primary cause, which Audius has already resolved at the time of publication. The exploit cannot be used anymore. The AUDIO governance token holders can now tip their preferred artists on the platform, and the artists can respond with emojis. Audius recently introduced this functionality. The AUDIO token is an ERC-20 token based on Ethereum but connects to Solana via a bridge to speed up transactions and cut costs.

Is it safe to hold now? Key Technical Points: The UNI prices dropped by 4.7% in the last 24 hours. The coin price wavering between the $7.5 and $6.65 level shows a no-trading zone. The 24-hour trading volume of Uniswap is $245.4 million, indicating a gain of 43.12%. Past Performance of UNI Amid uncertainty in the crypto market, the UNI/USDT pair formed an inverted head and shoulder pattern in the daily chart. On July 9th, altcoin gave a massive breakout from the $5.82 neckline, indicating early signs of a trend reversal. The post-retest rally surged 40% higher to the $7.5 mark. Source – Tradingview UNI Technical Analysis Following the $6.66 breakout, the UNI price trend lost bullish momentum, leading to a consolidation range between the $7.5 and $6.65 barriers. This small consolidation can be referred to as a short break for buyers before continuing the prevailing recovery. While the price action walks a lateral path, the daily-RSI slope plummets lower, indicating a loss of bullish momentum. Thus, if bearish divergence continues to sink lower, the altcoin is likely to breach $6.65 Moreover, the MACD indicator showcases a sell signal with the bearish crossover of the fast and slow line. Hence, the momentum indicators project a high possibility of a price correction before the coin price could continue the bull run. In a nutshell, the Uniswap (UNI) technical analysis displays a consolidation phase under rising bearish momentum. Upcoming Trend A bullish breakout from $7.5 resistance would resolve the current uncertainty in the market in buyers’ favor. Thus, the potential rally may surge the UNI price to its first target of $8, registering a 7.7% gain. On a contrary note, a breakdown from $6.6 support would call for a significant retracement which may plunge the altcoin to the $5.8-$5.6 support zone.

In its latest 10-Q filing, the automaker indicated it received yet another subpoena in June “seeking information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement” previously reached in the matter. The inquiry also requested information on model 3 production rates in relation to the take-private pronouncements. The filing indicated that Tesla ( TSLA ) is currently cooperating with the investigation. The EV manufacturer also updated investors on legal proceedings related to its “toxic workplace culture.” The case of Diaz v. Tesla, which alleged workplace discrimination on the basis of race had originally concluded with a reduced award of $15M, cut from over $136M, awarded to the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff rejected the reduced award and instead opted for a new trial to challenge the auto manufacturer. That trial has been set for March 2023. Related to that case, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a civil complaint against Tesla due to race discrimination and hostile workplace claims. A hearing on Tesla’s motion to dismiss the case is set for late August. These proceedings add to the latest lawsuit filed by two shareholders on June 16, alleging a “breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment.” Elsewhere, the impairment charges incurred as a result of the automaker’s Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) sales were detailed. According to the filing, the company recorded “$170M of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $64M on certain conversions of bitcoin into fiat currency” during the first six months of 2022.

But, will the support trendline reverse this bear trend? Key Technical Points: The KSM prices dropped by 7.22% in the last 24 hours. The Kusama market value retests the $60 support level. The 24-hour trading volume of Kusama is $35.58 million, indicating a drop of 11%. Past Performance of KSM As mentioned in our previous analysis, KSM price action sustains above the $60 support level and the ascending trendline in motion. The recent bearish retracement has decreased the inflation rate over the last two weeks from 45% to 35%. Moreover, the drop in the trading volume during the correction phase supports the reversal possibility. Source – Tradingview KSM Technical Analysis The KSM price chart shows a drop to the support trendline today but the lower price rejection in the daily candle. Hence, despite the downfall in the last two days, the price action supports the reversal possibility. The RSI slope shows a double bottom reversal in the nearly overbought zone falling to the 14-day average line. If the RSI slope drops below the middle line, the possibility of a downfall below the support trendline increases Moreover, the MACD indicator showcases a drop in the buying pressure as the bullish histograms decreases. Hence, the possibility of a bearish crossover between the fast and slow lines increases. In a nutshell, the KSM technical analysis shows the high likelihood of a bullish reversal reaching the $82 mark. Upcoming Trend If the KSM price finds bullish momentum after the upside reversal from the support trendline, the market value may shoot up to the $82 mark. However, a downfall below the support trendline and the $60 support level to the next psychological support level of $50 is possible.

Wallets connected to Teddy Doge’s deployer contract exchanged TEDDY tokens for thousands of wrapped BNB, a BNB equivalent issued on Ethereum, from several accounts over the weekend, security firm PeckShield said on Monday.  “The deployer deployed the contract and transferred a large quantity of $Teddy to 0xdbe8ef79a1a7b57fbb73048192edf6427e8a5552, then pump and dump the price of $Teddy,” PeckShield said, terming the actions as a “soft rug pull.”  South Korean blockchain security firm Sooho also termed the project a ""soft"" rug pull. ""Rather than cheating on the code, it seems that the distribution allocated to the manager's account was divided and sold in bulk,"" said Jisu Park, CEO of Sooho. ""It's not a hack, it's a rug. But it's unclear whether they've abandoned the project, so we can call it a “'softrug.'”  Addresses connected to the project exchanged TEDDY for wrapped BNB, which in turn was exchanged for over 10,000 BNB and 2 million BUSD, PeckShield added. The converted funds were then sent to crypto exchange Binance.  This was possible as the rogue developers controlled the project's liquidity pools. Liquidity pools refer to the token pairs held by smart contracts on decentralized exchanges, such as PancakeSwap, with developers initially seeding both sides of a token pair.  In decentralized finance (DeFi), rug pulls are scams where the developers conduct legitimate work on a blockchain and then drain the liquidity pools from the project, essentially ""pulling the rug"" from under investors and causing a sharp fall in related tokens.

We have closed the cross-chain bridge and are in the process of fixing it,” the admins said, adding that TEDDY holders would soon be given DRAC, a new token, as the project was in the process of rebranding to Drac Network.  Teddy Doge, which offers token swap, non-fungible token (NFT) and cross-chain products, had raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in an initial token offering.

393479,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496588,1658749410,Introducing Crypto Commerce – How Blockchain Is Changing Commerce,"E-commerce has become an essential part of our daily lives, redefining commercial activities worldwide. Internet penetration has done wonders for the industry and contributed to its growth significantly. The global e-commerce industry was valued at $13 trillion in 2021 and is expected to reach $55.6 trillion by 2027. The Asia-Pacific nations account for more than 70% of all e-commerce activities. For example, China alone contributes $740 billion in e-commerce sales, while the United States accounts for more than $560 billion. This multi-trillion-dollar sector is now evolving to its next level, thanks to innovations in Web3. To this end, traditional e-commerce organizations are beginning to recognize the potential of technologies like blockchain and crypto. While blockchain provides secure and reliable infrastructure, cryptocurrencies introduce novel financial aspects and opportunities. And with these factors combined, we are now witnessing the rise of a new commercial paradigm, namely crypto commerce. Crypto Commerce: The New Word in Town Crypto commerce refers to buying and selling goods or services online using cryptocurrencies. C-commerce platforms are blockchain-based and thus support cryptocurrency transactions. However, unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that accept crypto payments, c-commerce provides additional crypto-based utility. It also incentivizes or rewards users for purchasing and referrals. The most distinctive feature of c-commerce is that it simultaneously benefits consumers and platforms. This is mainly due to the speed, cost-efficiency, and global accessibility of blockchain transactions. Moreover, users can easily create secure and cryptographically verifiable digital identities. And most interestingly, customers can earn by shopping in c-commerce. C-commerce also helps businesses scale better and faster. Its borderless nature lets merchants expand their outreach and scope for innovation. Additionally, crypto payments minimize chargeback frauds since transactions on the blockchain are tamper-proof and irreversible. Platforms like Shopify are thus accepting crypto payments nowadays, while blockchain-native cCommerce platforms show much potential. The Rise of Utility-Driven C-commerce Startups The e-commerce industry has been around for more than a decade, whereas the crypto revolution has only just begun. However, emerging startups are taking crypto seriously and developing utility-driven c-commerce stores. Exeno, for example, is one blockchain-based startup building a spectrum of a crypto-commerce ecosystem. The platform is a shopping marketplace powered by its native exeno coin ($EXN). It features a wide range of products that customers can purchase using their favorite cryptocurrencies and payment gateways, besides offering an immersive user experience. Moreover, it is one of the first to provide complementary features such as ID management, messaging, and bridges. The Future of E-commerce is on the Blockchain The transition from traditional e-commerce firms to blockchain-enabled ones has already begun. Blockchain technology significantly enhances e-commerce enterprises’ security, productivity, and transparency. This will enhance the user experience, allowing e-commerce platforms to attract new consumers while retaining existing ones. Furthermore, this may aid platforms in increasing revenue and consumer satisfaction. The nature of blockchain and the utility of cryptocurrencies have the potential to create a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity for e-commerce platforms. With the crypto market gradually becoming more prominent, e-commerce may transition to c-commerce.

Audius, a tokenized music streaming project, relies on community voting and governance to make decisions. On Saturday, a malicious proposal saw attackers put up a fake post and manipulate token votes to steal funds.  The attackers initially floated “Proposal #84,” which delegated 10 trillion AUDIO internally to the staking contract (with no token supply change). That transaction failed because no votes were cast on the proposal.  Attackers then floated “Proposal #85,” which requested the transfer of 18 million AUDIO tokens in a governance vote. The attackers were then “able to call initialize() and set himself as the sole guardian"" of that governance contract, Audius developers explained in a post-mortem report on Monday.  The initialize() function gives a program its initial data point in a smart contract. That allowed the attacker to control the governance proposal solely and transfer tokens as the proposal was passed.  After Proposal #85 was put up, a transaction was executed that delegated 10 trillion AUDIO toward the votes, thus skewing the proposal in favor of the attacker. Circulating supply was unaffected, but the proposal passed as the erroneous votes were able to trick Audius’ smart contacts.

42422660,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0oA3h,1658747294,Bitcoin Drops Even as Wall Street's 'Fear Gauge' Indicates Calm Ahead of Fed Decision,"Bitcoin fell even as the Chicago Board of Options Exchange's volatility index (VIX), a measure known as Wall Street's fear gauge, showed an absence of investor anxiety ahead of an expected U.S. Federal Reserve rate increase on Wednesday.  The top cryptocurrency by market value changed hands near $21,900, down 3.5% in the past 24 hours. The price jumped 8.5% in the seven days through Saturday, the biggest weekly gain since March, alongside gains in stock markets on speculation the Fed may become less hawkish in coming months.  Fed funds futures indicate traders expect the central bank will raise interest rates by 75 basis points this week, with a small likelihood of a 100 basis point move. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.  The price drop is a surprise given the VIX index slipped to 22.41 in early Asian hours, its lowest level since April 21, indicating calm ahead of the Fed rate decision, and S&P 500 futures traded little changed. Bitcoin tends to move in line with risk assets and closely follows sentiment on Wall Street.  Bitcoin's renewed weakness may be a signal the Fed is set to stick to its path of aggressive tightening. Many traders, including Mobius Capital Partners' Mark Mobius, consider bitcoin a leading indicator for stock markets.  When the VIX spikes upward, it means investors are buying significantly more put options – or bearish bets – relative to calls – or bullish bets. A rising VIX represents a higher level of concern, while a declining VIX indicates less market fear and stability.  Experts call for caution  Investors could be in for a rude awakening should the Fed stick to a hawkish script.  ""With the VIX at 23, it is currently at its lowest level this year, heading into an FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, which I find bizarre,"" Michael Kramer, founder of Mott Capital Management, wrote in a market update published Sunday, adding that the positioning makes assets vulnerable to a potential Fed shock.  ""This complacency may be happening because the market has convinced itself that the Fed is close to pivoting, caving in and going back to its old ways of supporting asset prices,"" Kramer noted. ""This week's meeting may change the market's mind on how serious the Fed is regarding its battle against inflation and that it doesn't view the economy as weak or heading for a recession.""  Expectations that the Fed is close to opting for smaller hikes for the rest of the year and may eventually reverse course likely stem from signs inflation has peaked and concerns the economy could soon dip into a recession.  ""The market seems to be discounting that the Fed will blink in the face of bad economic data and we don't know that it will – all signaling so far has stressed their focus on inflation, and it's likely that we'll see continued determination until either inflation has showed definitive signs of peaking or the economy is in a lot worse shape,"" Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading, said. (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  The Fed has pledged not to let up its policy tightening until inflation moves materially lower toward its 2% annual target. The central bank's preferred measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditure (core PCE) price index, came in at 6.3% for May. Any Fed pivot may also be contingent on a marked decline in the consumer price index, which includes the volatile food and energy component and affects the spending habits of Americans. In June, the CPI soared 9.1% from a year earlier, a 40-year high.  ""Although the news on renewed wheat shipments and prices back to pre-invasion levels will help, as will continued downward moves on other commodities, the price increases in the CPI and PCE so far have been broad-based which hints at stickiness,"" Acheson said, referring to food exports from Ukraine and its war with Russia.  And while cracks are appearing in the housing sector, the broader economy looks resilient, thanks to strong jobs and wage growth. When it was last reported on June 30, the Kansas City Labor Market Conditions Index was at its highest since the late 1990s. The Atlanta Fed's wage growth tracker reached its highest since 1997 at the end of June.  The data provides the Fed with room to continue tightening, meaning the so-called hawkish Fed trade, which involves buying dollars and selling risk assets, could continue to roil markets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""I don't think the hawkish Fed trade has peaked,"" Acheson told CoinDesk. Since March, the Fed has raised borrowing costs by 150 basis points, lifting the benchmark interest to the 1.5%-1.75% range.  Worst may be over  Although the hawkish trade appears to have legs, other factors may ensure limited downside in crypto.  ""The narrative decoupling is likely to become more apparent as global economic fractures widen,"" Acheson said. ""And there is also the Ethereum Merge trade, the DeFi (decentralized finance) trade and other signs of progress to further distance crypto market performance from stock market performance in coming months.""  David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase Global, said the bullish positioning in the dollar appears overdone and could reverse depending on what the Fed signals later this week.  A recently published Bank of America fund manager survey cited long U.S. dollar, long oil and short stocks as crowded trades. Such extreme risk-off or bearish positioning often portends a trend reversal higher. Several indicators have flashed signs of a bear market bottom recently in bitcoin.  That said, according to Duong, a bull revival will take time.  ""But even though the worst for crypto is probably over, I think we still need a few more months for things to stabilize before digital assets like bitcoin can start to recover in earnest,"" he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/25/bitcoin-drops-even-as-wall-streets-fear-gauge-indicates-calm-ahead-of-fed-decision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3dd4b9c0befd2bca487f848bb181d0ec0808c45d-1707x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Barclays is expected to invest a sum in the ""millions of dollars"" as part of the raise, Sky News reported on Sunday, citing sources. The funding round values Copper at $2 billion and is expected to close in the coming days.  Copper has chosen to become regulated in Switzerland, after it was unable to register with the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority.  Former Chancellor Philip Hammond serves as an adviser for Copper.  Barclays is one of the U.K.'s biggest banks with total assets of around $1.4 trillion as of 2021.  Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said the bank's move ""does not come as a surprise,"" given Barclays' prior investment in institutional crypto services provider Elwood Technologies in May.  ""This shows that although crypto faces significant hurdles, due to the macro environment and a lack of buyers, financial institutions are showing an increase in interest, and the long-term value continues to expand,"" Sotiriou said.  Neither Barclays nor Copper immediately responded to requests for comment.

Key Technical Points: The GALA prices dropped by 6.96% in the last 24 hours. The market value of the gaming token fails to exceed the 50-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Gala Games is $219 million, indicating a drop of 8%. Past Performance of GALA As warned in our previous analysis, GALA prices fail to break the resistance trendline as the increased selling pressure restarts another bear cycle. The falling prices retraced by 15% in the last five days and tested the psychological mark of $0.50. However, the similar declining trend in the intraday trading volume over the crypto market supports the possibility of an upside reversal to break the resistance trendline. Source – Tradingview GALA Technical Analysis The GALA price chart shows a drop of 5% today, teasing a downtrend continuation this week. Hence, the opposing price action and declining trading volume trend suggest traders wait for the price action confirmation. The substantial bearish influence above the halfway line keeps the RSI slope within the nearly oversold zone. Furthermore, the slope dips under the 14-day SMA, reflecting an increase in underlying bearishness. Moreover, the MACD indicator showcases a declining trend in the buying pressure as the MACD histograms lose intensity. And due to this, the MACD and signal lines prepare for a bearish crossover. Additionally, the MACD indicator displays an increase in selling pressures as the MACD histograms diminish in size. In turn, the MACD and the signal lines prepare for a bearish crossover. Thus, the momentum indicators predict the possibility of a downward trend that continues below the 50-day SMA. In a nutshell, the GALA technical analysis shows the technical indicators and price action supporting the bearish intent. Upcoming Trend If the GALA price does not hold over the $0.050, the selling spree could fall to the $0.045 level. Then, the traders can anticipate the fallout rally hitting the support trendline at $0.030. However, an early bullish reversal will sabotage the bearish rally, help regain the $0.050 value, and reach the overhead resistance of $0.070.

387851,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=243785,1658738751,Argentine Central Bank Rules Bar Crypto Investors From Buying Dollars,"A new set of regulations from the Argentine Central Bank now applies to people and businesses who bought cryptocurrencies to hedge against currency devaluation. To stop the exchange rate from rising, the bank will only sell dollars at the official rate to people and businesses that haven’t bought cryptocurrency in the 90 days before the operation. The transmission, bearing the reference number 7552, states that the person will have access to the official dollar markets. It is necessary to meet these limitations 90 days in advance before buying dollars on the official market. Closing The Gap And Regional Responses Local sources claim that the proposed limitations would aim to close the loophole. Some businesses take advantage of the exchange control channels by buying cheap dollars at the official rate, using those dollars to purchase cryptocurrencies, and then exchanging those cryptocurrencies at a higher cost. To prevent the instances mentioned, the Argentinian Central Bank also implemented a new rule prohibiting purchasers of these dollars from purchasing any cryptocurrency 90 days following the transaction. Argentina Looking For Switch From Traditional Exchanges Most of the Argentinians’ reactions were negative, and some even questioned the wisdom of such a move. Economist Agustin Monteverde has challenged the reasoning for this action. Argentina is already looking to switch from traditional exchanges, which must disclose cryptocurrency transactions, to peer-to-peer-based discussions, where the transactions can be private between two individuals.

They have been accused of selling unregistered securities and making false statements about the stability of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin and its related LUNA token. Terraform Labs And Others Face Second Class Action Suit According to a press release from Sunday, U.S. law firm Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., has filed a class action lawsuit against Terraform Labs, Do Kwon, and other associates in the Northern District of California on behalf of investors who bought Terra-issued tokens between May 20, 2021, and May 25, 2022. Other defendants in the case include Jump Crypto, Jump Trading, Republic Capital, Republic Maximal, Tribe Capital, DeFiance Capital, DeFiance Technologies, GSR Markets, Three Arrows Capital, and Nicholas Platias. The lawsuit is the second class action lawsuit to be filed in the U.S. involving the above parties since the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May. To cite one example, in June, Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP launched a similar class action lawsuit against Terraform Labs. Following the infamous collapse of Terra’s UST and LUNA token, investigations into the underlying causes have heated up. South Korean investigators raided the home of Terraform Labs co-founder Daniel Shin and several exchange offices earlier last week. According to reports, officials seized records in an attempt to prove that Do Kwon and his associates were involved in a fraud against Terra investors.

However, should you hope for a reversal? Key Technical Points: The ENJ prices dropped by 7.39% in the last 24 hours. The market value of Enjin retraces to the 50-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Enjin is $74.82 million, indicating a drop of 12%. Past Performance of ENJ As mentioned in our previous analysis, Enjin (ENJ) breaks the bearish trend as the market price exceeds the resistance trendline and the 50-day SMA. However, the prices fail to sustain above the $0.58 support level and retrace 12% over the last week to retest the broken trendline. However, the declining trend in the intraday trading volume over the past supports the possibility of a bullish reversal from the resistance trendline. Source – Tradingview ENJ Technical Analysis As the Enjin (ENJ) price action shows higher price action in the daily candles, the possibility of prices crossing below the 50-day SMA increases. However, the weak bearish commitment depicted by the intraday trading volume supports the possibility of a post-retest reversal. The increase in underlying bearish sentiments is evident in the technical indicators in the daily chart. The RSI slope falls to the halfway line as it fails to sustain in the nearly overbought zone. However, the 14-day SMA supports the RSI slope and keeps the possibility of a reversal feasible. Moreover, the MACD indicator showcases a declining trend in the buying pressure as the MACD histograms lose intensity. And due to this, the MACD and signal lines prepare for a bearish crossover. Hence, the momentum indicators project a high possibility of a downtrend continuation under the 50-day SMA. In a nutshell, the ENJ technical analysis displays the technical indicators and price action analysis under the bearish influence. Upcoming Trend If the Enjin (ENJ) price fails to sustain above the 50-day SMA, a selling spree will break the $0.50 psychological mark. Traders can expect the fallout rally to reach the $0.45 support level. Optimistically, the post-retest reversal can nullify the bearish planning and reclaim the $0.60 value to reach the overhead resistance at $0.77.

Borisov described how the government had frozen his bank accounts without informing him of the situation on his website Art is Crime. The developer who received the money from 3,557 NFT releases noted in the case chronology that the case processes began in February of this year. Still, he didn’t learn about the situation until May. No Regulation of Cryptocurrencies The developer claimed that he approached the Latvian State Revenue Service (VID) about how to legitimate his bitcoin revenue because there aren’t any clear crypto tax regulations. As a result, throughout 2021, he had to pay €2.2 million in income taxes. After being urged by the organization to declare himself a “self-employed person” and pay taxes on the euros withdrawn, he obliged by paying the taxes. He made money during the NFT boom of 2021 and identified himself as one of the successful musicians in the market, which is notable. Through his attorney’s assistance, Borisov could contest the freezing of his bank account, and on June 30, the court issued orders allowing him to access the money. The Case Appeal The account, however, was never unfrozen, and a subsequent investigation revealed that the case’s lead investigator had quit. It’s interesting to note that the newly appointed prosecutors also secured urgent warrants to take his possessions. On July 19, he claimed to have given the authorities a thorough account of his activities and earnings history as evidence of the money’s legitimate source. Former Meduza employee Borisov, who filed the case appeal, emphasized that no prosecutor had attempted to contact him about the proceedings. Consequently, the developer appealed against the ruling but anticipated further delays because of the cumbersome processes.

The 24-hour trading volume of Bitcoin is $27.02 billion, indicating a hike of 10%. Past Performance of BTC As mentioned in our previous analysis, Bitcoin (BTC) loses the weekly gains as it retests the broken resistance at $21,875 after cracking under the 50-day SMA. After forming a streak of small-bodied candles over the 50-day SMA, the prices have dropped by 3.4% today, increasing the deflation rate to 6% in the last five days. However, the declining trend in the trading volume supports the possibility of a bullish reversal after a successful retest. Source – Tradingview BTC Technical Analysis As the Bitcoin (BTC) prices fail to sustain above the 50-day SMA, the market sentiment takes a bearish turn. The possibility of prices coming back within range increases which may result in a drop under the $20,000 mark. The momentum indicators reflect the increasing fear of Bitcoin investors as the underlying sentiments worsen. The RSI slope falls sharply over the last five days resulting in a dip to the 14-day SMA and the halfway line. Moreover, as the bullish histograms decline, the MACD and signal lines are ready for a bearish crossover.

According to Sky News, the bank will participate in a capital round involving other investors and will be finalized soon. As stated by the publication’s sources, Barclays is anticipated to invest a “tiny sum in the millions of dollars.” In recent months, Copper has sought to fund at least $500 million, seeking an evaluation in the billions of dollars, but has encountered regulatory challenges in the UK. Barclays Raised $50 Million Funding In a Series B funding round last year, the company raised $50 million and later received an extra $25 million from billionaire British macro investment icon Alan Howard. Philip Hammond, a former UK chancellor, is one of its advisors. Established in 2018, Copper provides institutional investors custody, prime broking, and settlement services. According to a May Financial Times article, Barclays has experience with cryptocurrency and has already invested in Elwood Technologies, a provider of institutional crypto services. The bank participated alongside Goldman Sachs and Mike Novogratz’s company in a capital round that gave Galaxy Digital a $500 million valuation. Crisis in Crypto Industry Earlier this year, it was planning to raise at least $3 billion in financing. Still, it has subsequently pulled that back in light of the escalating crisis in the more significant crypto-assets industry. Several significant market players, including Three Arrows Capital and Celsius, have declared bankruptcy recently, eroding faith in the sector’s once-rapid expansion. As a result of its dissatisfaction with the approach taken by UK financial regulators, Copper decided to build a hub in Switzerland.

FTX’s Bid was ‘Dressed Up as a White Knight Rescue’ On July 22, the founder and CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, offered to give early liquidity to Voyager Digital’s customers. West Realm Shires Inc., FTX US, and Alameda Ventures made the offer. Under the plan, Alameda would buy all Voyager digital assets and digital asset loans, other than loans to Three Arrows Capital, in cash at market value. FTX would offer the customers of Voyager an option to receive their share of claims by opening a new account at FTX. In response to the bid, Voyager lawyers stated the offer was nothing more than a “white knight rescue.” They said, “The AlamedaFTX proposal is nothing more than a liquidation of cryptocurrency on a basis that advantages AlamedaFTX. It’s a low-ball bid dressed up as a white knight rescue.” Voyager’s lawyers further stated that the bid from FTX and Alameda was “designed to generate publicity for itself rather than value for Voyager’s customers.” It undermined a competitive process, declared no value in Voyager and its intellectual property, and ignored tax consequences, among other things. The attorneys remarked that Voyager reserves all rights and remedies against Alameda and FTX for the “clear and intentional” interference with the bankruptcy process and any resultant damages incurred.

Despite the bullish streak, it hasn’t been able to move past the $1 psychological level. Technical indicators have remained bullish on the chart and pointed towards chances of reaching the $1 price ceiling. Over the last week, MATIC surged 22% and on the daily chart the coin moved up by 7%. MATIC had managed to touch the $0.97 mark however a small fall in buying strength caused the altcoin to fall on the chart briefly. Buying strength was positive displaying that bullish strength hadn’t faded away. A pullback can bring MATIC down to the $0.77 level. If buying strength remains consistent, then the coin can attempt to break above the psychological price ceiling of $1. At press time, MATIC had secured itself above the $0.75 support line. The global cryptocurrency market cap today was at $1.09 Trillion, a 2.6% positive change in the last 24 hours. MATIC Price Analysis: Four Hour Chart The altcoin was trading at $0.87 at the time of writing. The coin had briefly touched the $0.97 mark but was met with selling pressure. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $0.92, a move above which could force MATIC to touch the $1. Local support for the coin stood at $0.77, fall from that level will cause MATIC to reach $0.60. The amount of MATIC traded over the last trading session fell slightly which indicated that buying strength fell on the chart. The altcoin had visited the overbought zone a couple of times, however as the coin fell in value buying strength dipped. At the time of writing, buying strength remained more than selling strength. The Relative Strength Index was pictured above the half-line which meant that buyers were more in number. Price of the altcoin was above the 20-SMA line which meant that the buyers drove the price momentum in the market. This was a sign of bullishness for the altcoin. Related Reading | Bitcoin Funding Rate Remains Positive, More Decline Soon? The altcoin registered a small dip in buying strength and the technical indicator displayed the same. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence depicts the price momentum and change in that. MACD underwent a bearish crossover and formed red signal bars. These red signal bars represent sell signal for the altcoin. Awesome Oscillator portrays the price trend and also points towards chances of a reversal, the green signal bars still represent bullish strength. If the coin continues to keep up with the pace then buying strength has to support the coin. Broader market strength shall also help MATIC to achieve its psychological target of $1.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin trades sideways on Sunday but drops below $22.4K.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading around $22,300, down a percentage point over the previous 24 hours. Bitcoin had reached a more than one-month high on Wednesday, cracking $24,000, and was still trading comfortably over $23,000 early Friday before investors revisited their anxieties over inflation and the economy to back away from riskier assets.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was trading at $1,560, also down slightly for the same period. Other cryptos were largely in the red, with YGG and AXS both off more than 7%. The crypto Fear & Greed Index has improved over the past two weeks, but remains in fear territory, reflecting deep concerns about conditions potentially affecting crypto.  To be sure, market observers have viewed bitcoin's recent tenacity above $22,000 positively amid an unexpectedly high consumer price index (CPI) this month, slowing economic indicators and poor earnings. But crypto markets this week also struggled to make sense of Tesla's (TSLA) decision to jettison $936 million of its bitcoin holdings, the latest pivot in company founder and crypto influencer Elon Musk's ever-changing relationship with digital assets. Bitcoin has increasingly responded to the wider environment, including stock prices, which have plummeted this year.  ""BTC did see some positive price action following its resilience, post the CPI data earlier this month,"" wrote Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, in an email to CoinDesk. ""The fact that news of Tesla selling its BTC holdings did not crash the price is also a positive sign for the bulls.  FOMC meeting  Investors will now be eyeing this week's interest rate decision by the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC is widely expected to approve a 75-basis point hike, robust enough to satisfy critics of Federal Reserve timidity in tackling inflation but reasonable enough to encourage those who prefer a more moderate approach that is less likely to spur a steep recession and affect assets.  ""With this month's FOMC around the corner, we will be taking a conservative approach until the Fed's future direction becomes clearer,"" DiPasquale wrote.  Crypto declines tracked major equity indexes on Friday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell nearly 2% and the S&P 500, which has a heavy tech component, dropped almost a percentage point. Stocks, like cryptos though, had their best week in a while after months of losses. Gold rose slightly, although it has also steadily fallen from March highs over $2,000.  In a weekly review to investors, First Republic Bank noted weakening in the once-hot housing market, a sign that rising interest rates may finally taking a bite from demand. The National Association of Home Builders index dropped for a seventh straight month. U.S. housing starts in June were also unexpectedly weak, among other falling indicators.  Three Arrows Capital  Meanwhile, the founders of insolvent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, described the firm's collapse as ""regrettable,"" but denied claims they pulled money from the fund before its collapse, according to Bloomberg report. Three Arrows' implosion stemmed from the fall Terra ecosystem that has rippled through the industry since May. Investors are claiming Three Arrows still owes them $2.8 billion.  Yet in a report, banking giant Citi said that crypto contagion fears tied to recent events, including digital asset lending platform Celsius' failing, have peaked. Staked ether’s discount to ether (ETH) has narrowed, which suggests some liquidity stress may have passed, the report said, adding that the “acute deleveraging phase” has now ended given many of the large brokers and market makers in the sector have disclosed their exposures. In a further positive sign, stablecoin outflows have been stemmed, the bank said, and outflows from crypto exchange-traded funds (ETF) have also stabilized in recent weeks.  DiPasquale wrote that ""if the Fed remains aggressive"" with rate hikes, ""we could easily see BTC return to $20,000 or lower."" But he added optimistically that ""accumulation in that range could be a promising long-term opportunity.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,961 -0.9%  DJIA: 31,899 -0.4%  Nasdaq: 11,834 -1.8%  Gold: $1,727 +0.4  Insights  Coinbase's Enduring Allure Among Institutional Investors  Coinbase’s stock is down nearly 70% on the year, outpacing the declines of bitcoin. While many funds have used the onset of the bear market to reduce their stake in the exchange, there are also many institutional investors that have used the chance to acquire shares for what they perceive as a discount.  According to data compiled by Whale Wisdom, which tracks quarterly filings of the form 13F that discloses fund managers’ new investments, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest, exchange-traded fund issuer Exchange Traded Concepts, Cullinan Associates and Utah-based Refined Wealth Management all significantly added COIN to their portfolios as per filings dated June 30.  Ark Invest’s Wood has been a long-time Coinbase bull, highlighting in May that the U.S.-based exchange had no exposure to either the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin or the luna (LUNA) token.  “Given its inherent profitability, competitive position and massive opportunities, we believe the company is right to focus on investing in its derivatives offerings, [non-fungible token] platform and international expansion,” Wood wrote in a note outlining her bullish thesis on the company.  2.6 million shares  Whale Wisdom data shows that all firms that filed a 13F by June 30 collectively bought 2.6 million shares.  The Wall Street Journal said that 14 analysts it polled gave Coinbase a buy option for retail investors while nine gave it a hold, and two ranked it a sell.  The average stock target price from the polled analysts is $106.05, which would give it a $23 billion market cap.  Before the company did its initial public offering last year, its pre-IPO contracts were trading as high as $317, which would give the exchange a valuation of over $75 billion. Its current market cap is just under $20 billion. Even under the most conservative appraisals, there’s room to grow.
