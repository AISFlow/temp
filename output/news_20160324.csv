42398946,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjO2,1458853875,Dutch Central Bank to Create Prototype Blockchain-Based Currency,"The Dutch central bank has committed to developing an internal blockchain prototype dubbed ""DNBCoin"", according to a recent publication.    Buried in the latest annual report from the De Nederlandsche Bank, published on 16th March, is a tiny item detailing the experiment. Elsewhere in the report, DNB posits that blockchain tech could improve its business – a possible indication of how it may look to apply lessons learned from the DNB project.      Described only as a ""prototype coin based on blockchain technology"", there are no details on the project's release or objectives. DNBcoin is mentioned under a heading that loosely translates to ""aims for 2016"", suggesting that the project is a priority for in-house developers this year.    Mentioned on several occasions during the report, blockchain technology is offered as possible cost-saver in the financial industry, though the central bank concedes it's early to say what possible applications might take shape in the years ahead.  The report states:  ""[Blockchain technologies] can affect the revenue models [of] banking systems, they can also benefit with new ways to generate revenue and [reduce] costs.""  As pointed out by payments and banking consultant Simon Lelieveldt, the development signals a desire on the part of the Dutch central bank to explore blockchain tech as an avenue for swapping physical cash with digital replacements.  ""So when we now see central banks moving forward in the electronic cash domain (now conveniently labelled: blockchain/FinTech) it might be to no longer spin it off to the market, but to create a permanent digital replacement of cash,"" wrote Lelieveldt. ""Therefore, this time it might be different.""  Central banks and blockchains  In recent months, a growing number of central bank officials from around the world, particularly the Bank of England, have suggested that blockchain technology could be applied to create more centralized digital currencies.  Yet the process of doing so, it has been argued, could have a lasting impact on the legacy banking system.  In a speech earlier this month, Bank of England deputy governor for monetary policy Ben Broadbent – who indicated his belief that bitcoin won’t see major adoption – reckoned that a central bank-issued digital currency could reshape depositor behaviors and, in extreme cases, inhibit the ability of banks to extend loans should consumers migrate to the digital currency.  These concerns haven’t stopped ideas from being proposed focusing on how a central bank could issue its own cryptocurrency.  Researchers in the UK have gone as far as to propose a new kind of cryptocurrency, dubbed ‘RSCoin’, which was inspired by recent work done by the BoE but did not actively involve the central bank.

42398937,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjGA,1458852661,New York Fed Report Highlights Bitcoin Market Discrepancies,"Two analysts at the New York Federal Reserve Bank today published the results of analysis on how friction between bitcoin transactions could lead to price differences.  If true, their conclusion that fees charged by exchanges discourage arbitrage could help explain why many still don’t view bitcoin as a safe or stable store of value.  ""There are significant frictions when bitcoins trade in exchange markets, resulting in meaningful and persistent price differences across bitcoin exchanges,"" wrote Asani Sarkar, assistant vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, adding:  ""These exchange-related frictions reduce the incentive of market participants to use bitcoin as a payments alternative.""  The argument goes that since every bitcoin is the same as any other bitcoin, they should all be valued equally. The price differences across exchanges should be offset by arbitrageurs buying bitcoin from one exchange for a low price and immediately selling it on another exchange at a higher price.  As a case in point, the bank presents data from BTC-e, Bitfinex, and Bitstamp, three of the larger bitcoin exchanges in the world. According to the authors' interpretation of the data, bitcoins bought on BTC-e ""consistently"" trade at a lower price than those bought on either Bitfinex or Bitstamp at an average of 2% and as much as 20%  To account for this difference, the authors argue that fees charged by the exchanges for transactions, withdrawals and deposits of traditional currency disincentive arbitrageurs and lead to the price differences.  ""These fees reduce the profits from arbitrage, and may explain the observed price differences,"" the authors write.  The idea that bitcoin is a poor store of value compared to more traditional investment vehicles is nothing new, but companies like LedgerX are waiting for permission from the CFTC to create options that could help off-set risk.  An increased interest from family offices in investing in bitcoin could help provide the incentive to fix potential market problems.

42398949,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjQz,1458840688,Vitalik Buterin Charts Ethereum's Path Forward at Coinbase HQ,"Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin gave a presentation at the headquarters of San Francisco bitcoin startup Coinbase this week in which he outlined the road ahead for the open-source blockchain project.  Fresh off the launch of its first production-ready version Homestead, a number of bitcoin industry startups have begun to take a closer look at Ethereum, exploring its capabilities as part of pilot projects. Coming amid the ongoing block size debate, as well Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s pointed criticisms of the bitcoin network, the event sparked speculation on social media forums in the days leading up to the event.  However, while Coinbase co-founders Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam were present at the event, there were no major announcements or indications that the startup was moving to formally embrace or begin building products on top of the technology.  Comprising roughly 30 slides, Buterin's presentation gave an overview of Ethereum’s path forward, which will include two additional releases, dubbed Metropolis and Serenity, to be launched at later dates.  Buterin discussed network statistics including the number of decentralized applications running on the platform, the price of its native token, ether, and the rising number of global meetups dedicated to Ethereum.  Still, Buterin sought to downplay expectations for the platform, indicating that, despite assertions, the toughest work for Ethereum's development team lies ahead.  For example, Buterin said that ensuring optional privacy on the network and proving it can scale are current points of concern. Elsewhere, slides touched on the platform’s three-stage planned transition from proof of work to proof of stake transaction validation, and proposed improvements to its Ethereum virtual machines which handle the blockchain's internal state.  The event was open to the public, and according to its Meetup page, drew roughly 40 attendees.

42398947,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjQ0,1458839281,French Legislators Highlight Blockchain Tech at National Assembly Event,"France’s legislature, the National Assembly, is holding a blockchain symposium today. Notably, the day features a closing statement by Emmanuel Macron, France's Minister of Economy, Industry and Digital Data.  The event, titled ""Blockchain: Disruption and Opportunities"", features three panels and is set to host a range of representatives from the French public and private sectors, including France's bitcoin and blockchain community. Startups represented include Paymium, Stratumn and Slock.it, among others.  The aim of the event, according to a Google Translation of its French-language notice, is to educate “parliamentarians, senior officials, business leaders, opinion leaders and teachers” on the subject of blockchain tech.  ""It is likely that the blockchain phenomenon [will cause], in the months and years to come, a real upheaval of the Internet economy,"" the notice states.  The event is free and open to the public. The majority of the event's runtime is comprised of three panels, which explore the basics of the technology; its use-cases and the make-up of the ecosystem surrounding it; and the impact of blockchain technology on the French economy.  France's young Minister of Economy, Macron, previously worked in the banking industry, and was identified earlier this year by The Times in the United Kingdom as a possible candidate to be France's next leader.  Parliamentarians also in attendance, according to the notice, include Jean Launay, Thierry Benoit, André Chassaigne, Corrine Erhel, Jeanine Dubie, Alain LeBeouf and Lionel Tardy. State senators in attendance include Pierre Camani, Patrick Chaize, Jean-Claude Frecon, Bernard Lalande, Philippe Leroy, Hervé Marseille and Bruno Sido.

42398954,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjWt,1458837060,How OpenBazaar’s Early Adopters Are Testing the Online Market,"Back in April 2014, DarkMarket, a decentralized anonymous marketplace with a name guaranteed to fuel the nightmares of conservatives everywhere, was forked and given a more widely acceptable title.  The resulting, friendlier-sounding, OpenBazaar, was a fully functional, free to use, peer-to-peer (P2P) market platform with robust decentralized infrastructure that enabled commercial activities to be conducted outside the control of third parties.  If that sounded like a formula for another illicit drugs marketplace such as the notorious Silk Road, the project lead Brian Hoffman stressed that that wasn’t the aim.  Speaking to CoinDesk in June of that year, Hoffman spelled out the central value proposition for OpenBazaar as being the freedom of two parties to transact without needing to rely on the security and integrity of a questionable centralized service, adding that the team behind the project will push for lawful uses of its service.  A redesigned and improved OpenBazaar launched in test mode on 2nd March. The test period during which the site only accepts ""testnet bitcoin,"" which has no value, is intended to help the developers identify as many bugs as possible, with as little risk as possible.  The project's test version has been downloaded more than 19,593 times and early vendors are up sporadically, with service to the site itself still being rather spotty.  OpenBazaar co-founder Sam Patterson told CoinDesk the market has released four new versions based on lessons learned from the tests and expect at least one more before the final launch in ""the next few weeks.""  Not willing to wait for the release of a field-tested version of the software, a ""handful of eager users"" downloaded and ran the ""mainnet version"" of OpenBazaar at their own risk, according to this Reddit post, which Patterson verified.  On 3rd March, the first OpenBazaar transaction for three ""SuperBitcoiner"" keychains was conducted between Shayan Eskandari, a blockchain software engineer at BitAccess and Tyler Smith, author of the Reddit post. Shortly thereafter Smith made two more purchases: two sets of two OpenBazaar pins from Patterson and a single can of Red Bull from the other co-founder, Brian Hoffman.  While the potential for illicit sales on OpenBazaar has led to widespread coverage even before its launch, a closer look at what’s actually on the site — besides keychains and Red Bull — reveals a decidedly mild list of offerings, which perhaps shouldn’t be a surprise.  “We anticipate trade on OpenBazaar will reflect society in general,” Patterson told CoinDesk. “Only a small portion of people do morally or legally questionable trade, and that fact shouldn't prevent the vast majority of uncontroversial trade from being allowed to happen.”  Curious to see what the project's earliest vendors are up to? Below are some the ways in which users have already begun standing up digital storefronts using OpenBazaar.  Vintage Clothing  ID: 81a1afd9ba91b5bdc2cc7a9256b31c7f80567150  If you dream of the silver screen and fancy adopting the glamour of the time, the Vintage Fashion store provides a host of dresses, swimwear and more that will have people stopping you in the street and asking for autographs.  The store even sells tweeds, vests and more for the stylish gents out there.  All prices are currently set to 0.0100 BTC while the marketplace is in test mode, but expect those to change once it goes fully live.  Bitcoin Full Node from Europe  ID: 49594fa38782012d083b3d1317d788c5e3d7f4c7  Offering well-meaning bitcoin advocates a way to support the network, this ‘store’ is selling bitcoin node hosting as a service.  It provides a full node, running Bitcoin Core, from servers located in Eastern European countries.  Three different plans are currently on offer, providing either 1, 3 or 6 months of uptime, at prices ranging from 0.0359 BTC to 0.1029 BTC.  Within 24 hours of purchase, the seller says, purchasers will be provided with a dedicated full node IP address and a second page where statistics can be monitored.  Jacob Ian Long, Esq. (Moderator)  ID: 00a68cde7741e12f5b92dc8900ead830336845e7  Some of the more unusual products currently available on OpenBazaar are the services of a moderator.  There are two kinds of fees ways to pay a vendor on the platform. The first, direct payment, could be considered risky unless the buyer knows and trusts the seller. As with all bitcoin transactions, there are no charge-backs for products or services not rendered.  The other payment option is called Moderated Payment, where the buyer sends the bitcoin purchase amount into an escrow account and the funds are later released when the transaction is completed.  The moderator doesn’t do anything for successful transactions. In the instance of a dispute the moderator decides which side is at fault and decides whether or not to release the funds. For the services, the moderator is compensated with a fee.  Both vendors and moderators are subject to a reputation grade that over time can achieve a value of its own.  When a moderator first joins, OpenBazaar predicts he or she will leverage their reputation in real life to help gain trust, as it appears is the case with the above lawyer. Incidentally, in addition to being a moderator, this profile, which purports to be that of a licensed Florida attorney, sells educational materials for 0.0024 BTC.  Ledger  ID: 72aceac3d5d0b7aa5d209b003f4e1d6cf616778  Not surprisingly, a fair amount of bitcoin services are available via the OpenBazaar platform, including one vendor selling products from bitcoin hardware startup Ledger.  Other cryptocurrency-related vendors offer to sell other virtual currencies — including Litecoin and Dash — in exchange for bitcoin.  Distributed Tees  ID: de92d20920cd781900f5f8a02797b6caa9bcc4bf  For the hipster shopper with an occasionally economic bent, this store, which identifies as being based in the United States, sells screen printed t-shirts for 0.0239 BTC.  ""Squatters""  ID: various  There's a notable contingent of what appears to be squatters on the site. These are more sophisticated vendors than your typical generic avatar profiles with no content, but for whatever reason, don't yet have any offerings.  One good example is BazaarGaurd, described as a ""moderation and buyer safety guide,"" which has a OneName verified account, a Twitter account, a GitHub account and an email address, but under services there's nothing more than a note explaining : ""More information soon.""  In an email to CoinDesk, one of the site's organizers confirmed he is preparing a ""dispute guide for market-goers"" in advance of the market's formal launch. With nine people already following the account its easy to imagine the potential benefits of being an early adopter at OpenBazaar, assuming it takes off.
