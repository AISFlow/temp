42398715,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgR7c,1444078887,Commonwealth Central Bankers to Discuss Bitcoin's Role in Remittances,"Central bankers and senior finance officials from the Commonwealth are set to discuss bitcoin and digital currencies within the context of global remittances during a meeting tomorrow.  The event is part of a two-day gathering of officials from the intergovernmental organization on 6th and 7th October.  Comprised of 53 member-states, the Commonwealth is among a growing number of intergovernmental bodies to conduct work on digital currency issues. In late August, the Commonwealth Secretariat's Virtual Currency Working Group advocated that member nations move toward regulating the technology.  Bitcoin and digital currencies will be discussed within the context of a meeting on ""maximising the potential of remittances, a significant source of external finance for many developing countries"", according to the Commonwealth.  Bangladesh Central Bank governor Aitur Rahman is set to chair tomorrow’s meeting, according to Commonwealth Secretariat spokesperson Hannah Murphy.  Murphy told CoinDesk:  “Commonwealth central bank governors will meet on 6th October to consider a number of policy recommendations to increase and protect remittance flows including the potential of virtual currencies to decrease costs and improve the efficiency of transfers.”  The organization said in a press statement that other topics up for discussion include tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing during the two-day event.  A statement from the group is expected to be released after the conclusion of the meeting.

42398698,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgOl1,1444067405,Europol and Interpol Partner to Fight Digital Currency ‘Abuse',"Europol and Interpol have agreed to work together on issues related to the criminal use of digital currencies.  The partnership became official during this year's Interpol – Europol Cybercrime Conference, an annual gathering of international law enforcement officials, held in The Hague. The event, Europol said, drew more than 350 attendees.  According to a statement from Europol, the partnership will see coordination ""against the abuse of virtual currencies for criminal transactions and money laundering"".  The statementhttps://www.europol.europa.eu/latest_news/europol-%E2%80%93-interpol-cybercrime-conference-makes-case-greater-multisector-cooperation  said:  ""[The partnership] will include actions around policy, stimulating operation cooperation and the development and delivery of training to fight the criminal use of virtual currencies, enabling detection, seizure and forfeiture of criminal assets.""  Other organizations have been invited to join, according to the statement.  The announced partnership comes on the heels of a Europol report that asserted bitcoin could become a common currency for criminals in the European Union. In the past, the agency has pointed to digital currencies as a driver of the ""crime-as-a-service"" business model.  Interpol has long worked on digital currency related initiatives, including the development of its own cryptocurrency and the launch of a war game series geared toward law enforcement.

42398699,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgOmz,1444061730,Fed Chair: Bitcoin's Popularity Unrelated to Central Bank Policy,"US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen has issued new comments on how she believes the country's financial regulators should address bitcoin and blockchain technologies, stating that these agencies must be careful not to ""stifle innovation"".  The statements were issued in response to a question submitted to Yellen by US Representative Mick Mulvaney following a 15th July meeting of the House Committee on Financial Services' Monetary Policy and Trade, of which he serves as vice chairman.  In his 11-page submission, Mulvaney sought clarity as to how the central bank viewed the increasing popularity of bitcoin after this summer's economic crisis in Greece, notably asking Yellen if the technology's increasing popularity implied the public may be losing faith in the Fed's ability to conduct monetary policy.  Yellen responded:  ""We do not interpret bitcoin's popularity as having a relationship with the public's view of the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy.""  Despite asking two questions, Yellen focused most of her response on how she believes regulation should develop in the US, emphasizing that the Federal Reserve and federal banking agencies have ""limited authority over the operation of digital currency systems"" as a whole.  ""Where a banking organization supervised by the Federal Reserve provides services to a business or individual that is an administrator or exchange of a digital currency, the Federal Reserve seeks to ensure that the banking organization fully complies with all applicable regulations,"" Yellen stated.  Other federal and state regulators, she continued, may have different authorities over the technology, depending on their specific mandates.  The remarks are consistent with past public statements given by Yellen in regards to the development of bitcoin and blockchain technologies.  Yellen first addressed the technology in a Senate Banking Committee meeting last February, at which time she stated that the US central bank does not have the authority to supervise or regulate digital currency systems such as bitcoin.  Costs and benefits  Yellen suggested that US authorities weigh the ""costs and benefits"" of new statutes or regulations carefully.  Aspects to consider, she suggested, include how such laws could ""strengthen the soundness of virtual currency schemes and increase public trust in the products"" and whether the technology represents a ""significantly different or greater risk"" than other new payment systems.  Yellen cautioned that the ""evolving nature"" of the technology means that such laws should not stifle innovation, a balance that regulators have so far stressed they are seeking to strike with mixed success.  ""Some may refrain from investing in or using digital currencies due to a perceived legal uncertainty and/or lack of consumer protection,"" she continued.  New York's state-specific regulatory regime for digital currencies, for example, has come under fire by industry supporters for being overly vague while imposing high costs on startups.  Other attempts, such as those ongoing in California, have been met with equally mixed public responses.

42398701,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgOm0,1444059500,"US Government to Sell 44,000 BTC in Final Silk Road Auction","The US Marshals Service (USMS) has announced it will sell 44,341 BTC (worth approximately $10.6m at press time) in an online auction due to take place on 5th November.  To be held from 12:00 UTC to 18:00 UTC, the six-hour auction, open only to pre-registered bidders, represents the final sale of bitcoins in connection with civil forfeiture actions taken against convicted Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht.  The bitcoins will be sold in 21 blocks of 2,000 bitcoins, with the remaining 2,341 BTC to be sold in a separate block. Winners, the agency said, will be notified on 6th November.  The agency continued:  ""The registration period starts 19th October and runs until noon 2nd November, at which time potential bidders must have completed all registration requirements. Registration documents that were submitted for the Marshals’ previous bitcoin auctions are not valid for this auction; interested bidders must submit new registration documents to be considered for this auction.""  The announcement comes one month after the USMS revealed to CoinDesk that it was likely to set a date for its final auction of the assets before the year's end.  In total, the USMS seized more than 144,000 BTC (then worth $122m) from Ulbricht in late 2013. The majority of the holdings – 100,000 BTC – have since been liquidated by the agency in two public auctions.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/05/us-government-to-sell-44000-btc-in-final-silk-road-auction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb93eb117b4ba977328178df3be7943aa1bcb1d1-1456x650.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398714,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgOzm,1444051809,Bitcoin Exchange Gemini Approved for Launch in New York,"Gemini, the much-anticipated bitcoin exchange led by entrepreneurs and investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has received approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services to begin serving US customers in 26 states as well as Washington, DC.  First announced in January, the New York-based startup was advertised as a ""fully regulated US bitcoin exchange"" for individual and institutional customers, one that its founders suggested could growth to become the ""NASDAQ or Google of bitcoin"".  Gemini said it is now onboarding customers and will officially open for trading on Thursday, 8th October at 13:30 UTC. Transfers to and withdrawals from the exchange will be free, though a charge of 25 basis points the value of every trade will be applied to both buyers and sellers.  The exchange launch coincides with increasing activity in the US bitcoin exchange sector, following Coinbase's entrance into the market in January and itBit's in May. The exchanges have raised $106.7m and $23.3m, respectively, but despite the headstart in the market, Gemini president Cameron Winklevoss said he believes there is room for an improved offering.  Winklevoss told CoinDesk:  ""We have seen a lot of inbound interest now that people know we’re an entity, we have a long queue of individual and institutional of people waiting to sign up. I think the demand is there.""  At launch, the exchange will feature email and voicemail support, and offer market and limit orders. ""We’re starting off aiming to be basic and understandable,"" he said. It will not offer discounts to new users of the platform, with Cameron Winklevoss suggesting the company was seeking a more elite clientele.  ""We’re trying to build a business and we want customers who are serious, not people who are here for a discount. You pay for what you get,"" Winklevoss said.  New customers of the exchange will need to verify bank accounts through online bank statement verification and answer questions related to their credit history.  User interface  Winklevoss stressed that Gemini is seeking to become the most intuitive and easy-to-use exchange for US customers, a feat it has tried to accomplish through visualization.  Exchange users, for example, will be able to observe how their orders might affect the market prior to placing either buy- or sell-side trades.  ""We’re running a simulation of other exchange engines in your browser. If you have this order, it will show you the estimated price. Even if you’re buying $50 worth of bitcoin, it will show you something interesting,"" he continued.  More front and center is the exchange's clean design and cool color scheme, as well as alternative visualizations for buyers and sellers, a small nuance that Winklevoss suggested would better help traders avoid simple mistakes.  ""Financial products tend to look wonky and we wanted to try to avoid that altogether. I think you can have a powerful product and have it be very clean and simple,"" he said.  Digital asset exchange  When asked about the company's long-term strategy, Winklevoss suggested that the exchange has ambitions to move beyond the sale of a single asset, but that this path forward is unclear.  ""We’re a digital asset exchange, we happen to be doing bitcoin right now, but we have the ability to incorporate other digital assets,"" Winklevoss continued, adding:  ""There will be digital assets that do things that bitcoin is unwilling or unable to do. It’s a total possibility we will be doing more assets in the future. What those assets are remains to be seen.""  Winklevoss suggested that, initially, this would include expanding beyond the ability to handle only US dollar deposits to other fiat currencies. ""That’s not something that happens overnight, you have to take approaches in different areas to be compliant,"" he added.  As for the interest in bitcoin trading, Winklevoss cited the recent macro-economic crisis in Greece as an example of why digital currencies remain a promising asset class despite declines in the price of bitcoin.  ""Bitcoin has been behaving like a global macro-economic asset,"" he said. ""Institutions are definitely a focus of our customer base. People who want to trade around global events will be attracted to and using Gemini.""  Other initial customers for the exchange, he suggested, would be miners and retail traders.

42398706,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgOpw,1444049400,Ukraine's National Bank Issues Bitcoin Warning,"Ukraine's National Bank has warned against the associated risks that come with digital currencies such as bitcoin.  A statement from the bank dated 1st October, first reported by Ukrainian news site Finance.ua, said it should not be held liable for any losses incurred by consumers using digital currencies to settle transactions.  Instead, it urged banks, consumers and payment organisations to use approved payment systems that guarantee consumer protection.  Touching on the lack of an international virtual currency regulatory framework, a loosely translated version of the statement reads:  ""The National Bank of Ukraine will continue to study the experience of introducing innovative products to market payments and track policies of central banks and government agencies of other countries in order to settle the issue of virtual currencies in an European and global context.""  The statement also said that the bank was closely monitoring the development and use of new payments services. Although it believes that new participants should have an equal opportunity to enter the market, the bank noted that ensuring the security of payments was a priority.  A 'considered view'  Alexander Shelkovnikov, a founding member of Ukraine's Bitcoin Foundation, told CoinDesk that the central bank's recent recommendation was a more considered view than what it offered last year.  He said:  ""We see this statement as a step which justifies our existing collaboration with the Ukraine Central Bank in working out a considered regulatory position related to crypto currencies and market participants. Central Bank has not officially released any regulation towards cryptocurrencies to date and has only been recommending to treat these with care and consider all the associated risks.""  The news comes after reports in March this year that the Ukranian government was planning to block bitcoin accounts belonging to separatists operating in the East of the country.

Respondents in the 18–22 demographic were most likely to make that change, whereas those in the 58–68 bracket indicated the least willingness.  18% of respondents said that they would shift to a specific retailer if they provided ""social engagement as a form of currency redeemable for discounts or coupons"".
