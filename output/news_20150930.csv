42426527,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtPph,1443652511,Europol: Bitcoin May Become Sole Currency for EU Cybercriminals,"Europol has said in a new report that it believes bitcoin could become the go-to currency for digital criminals in the region.  The European Union's top law enforcement agency released its Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment for 2015 on 30th September, outlining its view of the top cybercrime threats facing the European Union.  The report focuses on the topic of bitcoin and digital currencies in a number of contexts, including the state of criminal financing and specific elements of illicit activity involving the technology.  Europol said that, according to its data, bitcoin accounts for as much as 40% of criminal-to-criminal payments online, with PayPal accounting for 25% of those reported. The figures build on previous statements from the agency regarding cryptocurrencies as a key factor in the development of the so-called ""crime-as-a-service"" ecosystem.  The agency noted in its new report:  ""Although there is no single common currency used by cybercriminals across the EU, it is apparent that bitcoin may gradually be taking on that role. Bitcoin features as a common payment mechanism across almost all payment scenarios, a trend which can only be expected to increase.""  OpenBazaar seen as threat  The report includes a section on the progression of law enforcement activities surrounding dark marketplaces, noting developments in the ecosystem since Operation Onymous, a November 2014 operation that resulted in the shuttering of Silk Road 2.0 and a number of other illicit sites.  Europol, pointing to that effort as ""a message"" to cybercriminals, acknowledged in the report that ""hidden services continue to grow, multiply and evolve"" despite the crackdowns.  As part of a look at future threats regarding dark markets, Europol identified OpenBazaar as an area of concern for law enforcement officials due to its peer-to-peer nature.  ""As the 'market' is peer-to-peer, there would be no website or server to be targeted by investigating law enforcement and intervention is a considerable challenge, mirroring the issues law enforcement currently has with investigations involving bitcoin,"" the report noted, adding:  ""Payments on the OpenBazaar use a multi-signature approach involving a third-party ‘notary’ to control the release of funds. This means that there is no possibility of performing an exit scam with customers’ and vendors’ funds.""  The report recommended that law enforcement officials work “to pursue investigative and research opportunities related to emerging technologies such as decentralised marketplaces like OpenBazaar” in conjunction with the private sector and applicable academic sources.  Regulatory effectiveness questioned  The report's authors cast doubt on the effectiveness of regulation being developed by both EU-level bodies as well as countries within the region.  The Europol report stated:  ""Any regulation of cryptocurrencies would likely only be applicable and enforceable when applied to identifiable users such as those providing exchange services. The inability to attribute transactions to end users makes it difficult to imagine how any regulation could be enforced for everyday users.""  It further added that ""it is clear that cybercriminals will continue to use whichever payment mechanism is convenient, familiar or perceived to be safe, including those that are already regulated and maintain anti-money laundering controls"".  Europol went on to encourage broader cooperation between law enforcement agencies on digital currencies, and further suggested that agencies ""monitor the alternate payment community"" for further intelligence into payment mechanisms.

42426546,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtQHh,1443643844,Russian Payments Firm Qiwi Seeks 'Bitruble' Trademark,"A Russian payments firm is pushing ahead with a plan to release its own cryptocurrency, reportedly submitting an application to register a trademark for the initiative.  According to Russian news agency Interfax, Qiwi is seeking to trademark the term ""Bitruble"". An application has been sent to the Federal Service for Intellectual Property.  The filing follows the company's move to acquire domain name space related to the term ""bitruble"", as reported by Kommersant earlier this month. Qiwi has also indicated that the cryptocurrency could be backed by some form of commodity.  The proposal drew attention given Russia's still uncertain stance on bitcoin and digital currencies.  Shortly after the payments firm disclosed its plans, Russian government officials denounced the concept as ""illegal"". More recently, the country's Ministry of Finance has moved to endorse criminal penalties for activities connected with ""money substitutes"" such as bitcoin.  A bill  that would prohibit money substitutes remains under consideration.  The developments further follow statements earlier this summer from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who entered the country's ongoing debate about digital currencies by stating during a television appearance that ""there are serious, really fundamental issues related to its wider use, at least, today.""

42426545,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtQFh,1443639686,Boost VC Investment in Blockchain Startups Tops $50 Million,"Boost VC has released new figures about its investments in startups focusing on bitcoin and the blockchain.  The San Mateo incubator, which has pledged to invest in 100 industry startups through 2017, revealed in a Medium post this week that it has invested in 52 bitcoin and blockchain companies since its founding in 2012.  According to figures provided to CoinDesk by Boost, bitcoin and blockchain startups have so far raised $52 million, compared to the $86 million across companies in all of its target sectors.  The figures suggest bitcoin and blockchain startups have so far captured 60% of the accelerator's total investments, with the average startup having raised $961,538.  The new data comes during a bid by Boost VC to attract a new class of startups to its program, and follows a shift in the incubator's emphasis to focus on virtual reality firms. Based on figures it has released, Boost's Tribe 6 includes just five bitcoin startups, compared to the 21 featured in its last 24-firm fund.  Boost VC CEO Adam Draper has recently been critical of developments in the industry, suggesting that early-stage industry startups may be suffering from a lack of vision, writing in a post earlier this year:  ""We are looking for crazy ideas, we are looking for big ideas from fearless founders, we are looking to push the evolution of the next stage of bitcoin and the blockchain.""

42426538,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtQ5h,1443634515,SEB: Blockchain Could Make Banks 'Radically More Efficient',"Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB), a Stockholm-based financial services firm with 1.7tn SEK ($202bn) in assets under management, announced yesterday that it was among 13 major banks that had joined the top-secret work underway at R3CEV.  Since R3 unveiled its mission this summer, the distributed ledger tech startup has so far signed on 22 banking partners to the project, all of whom are now participating in its bid to create a blockchain-based ""Global Fabric for Finance"" for banks.  Though public details about the project are relatively scarce, Rasmus Järborg, head of strategy at SEB, said that the bank saw the partnership as a way to further its ongoing research into blockchain technology, which it contends began in 2010 and intensified as the price of bitcoin spiked in late 2013.  Järborg identified payments, trading markets and securities settlements as the use cases SEB is most interested in exploring as a result of the partnership, telling CoinDesk:  ""As a leading corporate and institutional bank, the business-facing applications are immediately of more interest to us. However, we are a universal bank in Sweden and the Baltic countries and as it is quite early to predict which part of our business will be impacted first. We are looking at both [consumer and business applications] at the moment.""  According to its 2014 fiscal report, SEB's most successful product lines are in merchant banking, retail banking and wealth management, with the majority of its more than 1.5 million customers identifying as private individuals.  Järborg went on to suggest it is looking for R3 to ""create an environment for rapid prototyping and testing"" around the technology so it can yield solutions for its client base.  ""We believe these technologies will impact our business by making a number of our processes radically more efficient and less costly for our customers,"" he added.  SEB has its roots in one of Sweden's first private banks, Stockholms Enskilda Bank, which would later merge with Skandinaviska Banken in 1972. Earlier this summer, the bank was notably involved in a controversy surrounding the sale of funds to retail investors.  Evaluating opportunity  In statements, Järborg provided insight into work at R3, suggesting the banks involved ""regularly collaborate"", and that they are sharing innovations and insights as a result of the deal.  Järborg also spoke highly of R3 and its facilitation of these processes.  ""R3 has a very competent team with the right mix of experience, blending banking and markets with technology,"" he added.  SEB was also keen to highlight its status as one of the first banks in its region to announce a more concentrated effort in this sector of the FinTech space, while noting that the ""level of interest"" among its peers in Europe is high.  Järborg concluded by painting Europe as a market where conditions are ripe for an early stage technology, such as the blockchain, to be more widely adopted, concluding:  ""The Nordic market is tech savvy and electronic and mobile banking is extremely well-spread. This makes our consumers more prone to adopt new technologies and our entrepreneurs to start businesses in that space.""

42426532,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtQ1h,1443615674,Global Bitcoin Film Competition Calls for Submissions,"Bitfilm, the international bitcoin and blockchain-themed film festival, has released its call for entries today.  Founded in 2000, Bitfilm previously showcased films using digital technology creatively. Having experimented with bitcoin as prize money in 2011, it rebranded as bitcoin-only last year.  Managing director Aaron Koenig told CoinDesk the event aims to expand the reach of the technology beyond the usual crowd:  ""We want to reach a broad audience: people who are interested in bitcoin and want to know more about it, but who would not attend a bitcoin meetup or conference, as it seems too geeky for them.""  Kicking off in Berlin on 6th November, its finalists will be screened at different bitcoin hubs across the globe including San Francisco, Mexico, Budapest and Amsterdam. Winners in its two categories – best feature film and best short film – will be announced at Mexico City's LaBitConf on 5th December.  At the festival, bitcoin will be both prize money and a voting tool. Each film will have its own bitcoin address, with viewers donating to the submission they like best. The film with the most amount of funds when voting closes on December 4th will be the winner.  Could this leave the festival open to abuse, with filmmakers effectively paying their way to the prize? Sure, Koenig said. ""A film maker who motivates all his fans to donate for his film has better chances to win, but every filmmaker has that same chance, so I don't see it as problematic,"" he added.  Bitcoin on film  In the seven years since its inception, a flurry of filmmakers have taken up bitcoin's story. The biggest release so far, Tribeca-listed documentary The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin, hit number one on the iTunes download chart following its debut last October.  On the more salacious end of the spectrum, ex-DEA agent Carl Force (now awaiting sentencing on charges of money laundering and fraud) was said to have signed a deal with 20th Century Fox worth $240,000 for the inside scoop on Silk Road.  According to The Hollywood Reporter, the demise of Mark Karpeles – CEO of failed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox – is also being shopped around Hollywood by Creative Artists Agency.  Besides documentaries, Koenig himself is hoping to gather investment for a bitcoin-themed thriller via his other business, Bitfilm Production. Entitled Satoshi's Last Will, the feature-length film follows a detective as she sniffs out the bitcoin creator's murderous heir.

42426524,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtPrh,1443608609,Dutch Bank’s Innovation Chief Dismisses Bitcoin,"The head of innovation at ABN Amro has said the Dutch state-owned bank wants to stay away from bitcoin, but is interested in blockchain technology.  According to a report  , Arjan van Os, the head of the bank's innovation centre, cited the bitcoin's associations with drug trafficking and illicit activities as the reason behind the bank's decision to distance itself from the digital currency.  He said:  ""We want to prevent bitcoin's poor image reflecting on what we do with the blockchain, it's underlying technology. We see many opportunities [in the blockchain]. Bitcoin itself is outmoded.""  His comments follow an article, titled 'The Next Big Thing' and published on the bank's website in which he explained the basic principles of distributed ledgers and posed the question of how banks could remain at the forefront of innovation.  ""[Blockchain technology] has been tested, it is proven that it works and is used. However, the degree to which it is applied is still limited ... This is the time when we need to gather as much information as possible, should try all possibilities and should form networks of financial institutions, FinTech companies, start-ups and software experts ... We must be prepared to assume a new role in the financial sector. The digital world is indeed constantly in motion,"" he wrote.  Blockchain trend  Van Os' comments come amid an increasing interest in blockchain technology from some of the world's biggest banks and financial institutions.  Just yesterday, distributed ledger startup R3CEV announced the addition of 13 new banking partners – including Bank of America, BNY Mellon, Citi and HSBC – bringing the total number of banks involved in its project to 22.  Further afield, the chairman of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) recently addressed blockchain's potential to transform the financial system during a speech made at Australia's Carnegie Mellon University.  Earlier this year, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc made the headlines as reports suggested it was exploring how a blockchain-based solution could change the way in which shares are sold and transferred manually.
