42374532,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlGvL,1395496083,Why Bitcoin Needs its Own 'Got Milk?',"Adam Hanft is a brand strategist and founder of Hanft Projects, a consultancy firm that has worked with, among others, McKinsey, Microsoft, Conduit, Fidelity and Match.com. Here he shares his opinions on why bitcoin, the brand, is in dire need of some work.  The fiercely emotional debate about bitcoin – which is simultaneously an argument about the currency itself as well as a set of fixed views about governments, markets and economic structures – highlights a stunning gap in the bitcoin ecosystem.  On one hand, bitcoin is a brand – it’s the name of a currency and payment platform, like the euro or PayPal – but it’s a brand with no leadership at the top. As a brand, it's like an unguided missile, which is what you would expect since it’s a peer-to-peer framework with no governing locus or central authority. Bitcoin is like the weather or the ocean – it answers to no one.  📷  That can change, though. If one of the companies leading the bitcoin revolution started to adopt smart consumer marketing practices, others would follow – and they might even start to fund a consortium like the dairy cooperatives who bankroll “Got Milk”, or the Cotton Council, or one of hundreds of other trade associations.  Brand attentiveness  The last couple of months have demonstrated the need for this level of deep brand attentiveness, bitcoin has been bounced and bruised by the Mt. Gox bankruptcy; its association with the Silk Road shutdown; and dramatic volatility in pricing. Most recently, you can add buffeting to the bouncing and bruising, as Warren Buffett has said that while bitcoin can be an effective way to transfer money, so is a check, and ""the idea that it has a huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view”.  Because of its anarchic, distributed nature, the bitcoin brand can be created by anyone, and is at the mercy of everyone. Which means the arguments made on its behalf are not just diverse, but become platforms for bitcoin’s defenders to weave in their larger worldview, which is so often tendentious that it actually undermines the argument by distraction. That leaves most people confused and vulnerable to negativity, setting back the bitcoin adoption curve.  An example of what happens when extraneous commentary is dragged into the discussion – and I don’t want to pick on Ariel Deschapell who made this point in a piece for CoinDesk last week – is this quote.  “However Bitcoin is not just a currency that promises to eventually end the trend of patchwork national currencies that exist for the almost sole purpose of allowing governments to endlessly fund their own deficit spending.”  I know that when Mt. Gox went down, there was an open letter from some industry leaders that reinforced the long-term prospects of the currency – but a one-time communication is no substitute for a focused, strategic, disciplined effort to manage the bitcoin brand and brand it for the mainstream.  So as a thought experiment, if I was named CMO of the Bitcoin Council – formed to brand the otherwise amoebic and borderless bitcoin – here are some things that I would do.  1. Eliminate “cryptocurrency” from the vocabulary  “Crypto” is a prefix that has nothing good about it, especially as far as the mass market goes (and currency is the ultimate mass market product, after all). The word raises all the negatives of bitcoin – mysterious, not trustworthy and dangerously complex. It also triggers other “crypto” associations – like crypto-fascist, crypto-Nazi, and cryptosporidium, a germ found in fecal material that causes diarrhea. Not exactly the neural associations you'd want for your brand.  Because advocates aren’t marketers, the word appears all over bitcoin company websites – there’s even a “Cryptomining Blog”.  The alternative? Well, since we’re talking about something as deeply psychological as money, we need to understand how the mind is organized to think about it. George Lakoff, a brilliant semiotician and author of “Metaphors We Live By” has studied the way language actually shapes the mind and influences judgment and perception.  For bitcoin, that means the virtual currency runs up against the metaphorical construct of money as something real and solid. Just look at some metaphors and you’ll quickly see the pattern:  'Bring home the bacon'  'He holds onto every nickel'  'Cash on the barrelhead'  'That money in the bank is a real cushion'  'Bet your bottom dollar'  'He’s on the gravy train'  'Pay me in hard cash only'  'You can take it to the bank'  Or even: 'Peanuts'  Interestingly, “trust"" is also metaphorically physical, as in “I put my trust in him” or “I lost my trust” or “I misplaced my trust”. These are very powerful frameworks.  So the descriptor for bitcoin has to work within those existing metaphorical structures, rather than challenge them. That’s just what “wireless” accomplished; it worked within the construct of a landline phone – while making the point, first, that it was an outgrowth of something you were already familiar with.  For example, bitcoin could describe itself as “hard virtual currency” or “real virtual currency” or even “bankless money” to remind people how much they dislike banks. “Currency” is abstract, “money” is real.  2. Stress that bitcoin is in early days  Much of the bitcoin rhetoric is overheated – as most of the language of movements and rebellions always is.  As a mythical CMO of bitcoin I would dial all that back. I would avoid grand promises about upending the conventional money system, and calmly invite people to join us on a journey to create a new, trusted form of digital payments between individuals.  I believe that part of the volatility we’re seeing is the result of grand pronunciamentos that raise expectations to the fragile point where any negative news shatters the façade. They also make bitcoin advocates into unreasonable zealots.  Scientist Roy Amara famously said that we overestimate technology in the short term, and understate it in the long term. Bitcoin should calmly remind its detractors of the Amara Law.  3. Build confidence at every turn  For example, reinforce credibility by letting people know – in one central place – which retailers are accepting bitcoin. If you Google “Who accepts bitcoin” you don’t get a simple answer.  Social media can help, but most bitcoin social media functions are at the VC and investor level, not at the Joe Schmo level. It feels like the messaging in a political campaign, not that in support of a consumer product. There’s no storytelling about the advantages of using it – the fun, the convenience, the emotional rewards.  Also, over-communicate. Companies in the space should use their websites to tell their story, simply and powerfully.  4. Don’t insert bitcoin into ideological battles  Avoid using bitcoin as an ideological platform.  Some bitcoin advocates may think the Federal Reserve is the devil incarnate, others may think that the NSA is behind efforts to discredit the currency.  The point is that no successful payment system ever attracted users by an argument; you can’t build a mass brand in this category by winning debating points, but by demonstrating convenience and confidence points.  All of these strategies would be the first order of business for a bitcoin CMO. Can it happen without an industry association – recognizing that the structure of bitcoin makes it really hard for a focused and disciplined brand to emerge? I think it’s possible. We’ve seen examples where unstructured entities can maintain a common ethic and voice; Wikipedia is a great example.  Either formally or informally, the faster that bitcoin gets itself into consumers’ heads as a trusted brand, the faster it will get into their (metaphorical) wallets as a trusted currency.

42397428,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9M5H,1395489010,Inside New York's Bitcoin Centre,"New York is a city that continues to capture the world's imagination. It has long symbolized wealth, the heart of the American economy, and a land of freedom and limitless economic opportunity to immigrants everywhere.      For all the storied history of New York, a single trait has made much of it possible: its long standing position as the financial capital of the world.      The financial district in Manhattan is home to many historic landmarks and institutions. Buildings, some over a hundred years old, are home to the world's oldest and largest banking institutions. In particular, Broad Street is home to the likes of JP Morgan and the New York Stock Exchange, which has been a barometer of America’s economic health for almost 200 years.      A stone's throw from Wall Street with its neo-classical facade, the NYSE may be the ideal vestige of the old American hegemony; the exemplification of the powerful financial status quo. But just 100 feet down the road at 40 Broad Street is a newcomer, an upstart – a David surrounded by Goliaths.    Something for everyone    The Bitcoin Center NYC is a sparse, modern space, and is, as befits its purpose, missing the dramatic stone columns and ornate decor of many of the street's other buildings. But what it lacks in exterior detail it more than makes up for in openness and excitement.      It is the preeminent bitcoin location in the area, and currently hosts countless classes, talks, and a trading floor on Mondays and Saturdays.      On my visit, it became apparent the Bitcoin Center offers something for everyone, whether new to bitcoin or an experienced veteran. Perhaps what is most important about what the Bitcoin Center has to offer, though, is the atmosphere.      The individuals working at the Center, and those just dropping by, perfectly capture the feel of the cryptocurrency community, and what makes the bitcoin movement so fun to be a part of. All are extremely friendly, knowledgeable, but above all, contagiously enthusiastic.      These people will tell you all you need to know about the Center, and the greater bitcoin movement.    The co-founder's story    The Bitcoin Center NYC opened at the start of 2014, thanks in large part to co-founder Nick Spanos.      Spanos proved to be very mathematically and technologically minded from a young age. He went on to study computer science at the New York Institute of Technology, only to drop out and pursue real estate after making $80,000 in the field over just one summer.      [post-quote]      Spanos became a spirited entrepreneur throughout his life, founding multiple businesses and websites. He later went on to work for the Ron Paul presidential campaign, working in database management and analysis, and is a self-identified libertarian.      It was through his political involvement that Spanos met James Barcia, the Communications Director of the Bitcoin Center, and heard of bitcoin itself for the first time.      “We were talking about competing currencies in one of those conventions,” he recalled, “and someone brought up bitcoin – this was back in 2010.”      Considering his background, it was no surprise that bitcoin would capture his interests. If there was a stereotypical list of attributes that bitcoin supporters commonly share, Nick Spanos has all of them, as a self-made, libertarian tech entrepreneur.      Of the Bitcoin protocol, he said:      “Truth has a place in our society now. There is now, for the first time, universal, chronologically verifiable truth in the monetary system. As a protocol, it’s better for us”.            Moving on up    The NYC bitcoin community originally met outdoors in Union Square, resembling more a loose club than any organization.      Spanos recalls the incident that spurred him to seek better accommodation for the renegades.      “It was late, and we were leaving the park at night when someone working at a restaurant accidently dumped all this trash all over me when I was walking by. I think at that point I told myself ‘We’re better than this. We belong in Wall Street’.”      The group eventually moved within spitting distance of America’s most famous street after Spanos and some of his real estate partners acquired the location at 40 Broad Street. Bitcoin was moving up to the big league.    'Ground zero'    Many at the Bitcoin Center, like the bitcoin community at large, all have similar political or social history that made them particularly conscious of flaws in monetary systems that most others in developed countries take for granted.      However the Bitcoin Center is not without its diversity either.      Alex Andros, who is responsible for external relations, is Greek and Spanish, and has first-hand experience with inflating currencies and over-extended governments, as well as being a financial analyst by trade.      He first heard about bitcoin from a friend who was directly affected by the banking crises in Cyprus, and was immediately interested in its significance from an economics perspective.      On the other hand, Andrew Vecchio didn’t know much about bitcoin when he first walked into the Center pursuing internship opportunities in the Big Apple, but was immediately captivated by the protocol's decentralized nature and the choice it offered consumers.      Already clearly affected by the energy of the bitcoin community he explained, “I just love being at ground zero.”    Open doors    While many in the bitcoin community believe the sky's the limit, there are definite hurdles that have yet to be overcome. One of those hurdles is simple education.      While bitcoin has made exponential gains over the past year, many have either not heard of it, don’t understand it, or even worse are completely misinformed about various aspects.      That’s where a physical location like the Bitcoin Center comes in – a place where anyone is welcome to walk in and learn more about bitcoin in person. Indeed the Center has seen everyone from curious individuals to small business owners to professional economists.      Explained Alex Andros:      “All kinds of people come to our classes to learn how to take advantage of bitcoin. That tells you a lot about how widely appealing cryptocurrencies are. One of the funny things you often see here is the younger guys are usually teaching the older ones how things work, not the other way around. It’s the newer generation especially that is taking to bitcoin”.              As a whole the Center has received overwhelmingly positive media and community reactions, a reflection of the quality individuals there.    Big plans    Beyond basic education, however, the Bitcoin Center is starting to reap the benefits of New York's most valuable attribute: its networking capacity.      As the most densely populated city in the US and the financial capital of the world, New York is a pool of both talent and resources.      In addition, continuous regulatory development will likely give bitcoin businesses in New York increased legitimacy, something that Nick Spanos intends to take full advantage of:      “We want to be the first regulated exchange in the world. It’s going to be more like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange than anything, with a daily live floor and an online counterpart.”              He went on to explain “We don’t want to hold anyone's funds like Mt. Gox or these other exchanges. They’re using these old models that just don’t work well with bitcoin. People will be responsible for their own funds, we just bring them together […] keep the whole thing decentralised.”      Spanos added:      “We’re not just a kid with a computer like Mt. Gox, we’re not amateurs. We have connections in business, in Wall Street, and we have experience.”              Such a move would no doubt have massive implications in a market currently plagued by security breaches, theft, and exchange shut downs.      The community will likely have to wait until a later date for more details, but Spanos hopes to launch the full-time exchange sometime later this year, and promises it won’t interfere with the Bitcoin Center's continuing educational operations.    Lesson from history    Plenty still harbour doubts about whether bitcoin has long-term potential, let alone if it can challenge the entire global financial system. Indeed, despite its location, the rather unassuming Bitcoin Center NYC will probably do little to change the minds of critics by appearance alone.      Yet when comparing it to the much older and more powerful institutions around it, it’s important to keep some historical perspective. Over four centuries ago, in 1607, a group of traders in Amsterdam spent their days haggling with one another on one of the main commercial streets in the city, the Warmoesstraat.      However these traders weren’t exchanging goods or even, to the confusion of many, anything tangible for that matter. They were trading shares for the Dutch East India Company – the very first joint-stock company on the planet.      The market for that single stock became so active that an indoor exchange was built the following year, near the town hall, to accommodate the traders. It was in that unassuming building and from humble origins where a financial revolution that would shape the history of the world was beginning.      Today the New York Stock Exchange and the rest of the financial district in Manhattan stand as the pinnacle of that revolution, and are now witnessing firsthand what, to history, is an all too familiar scene.      If these Goliaths aren’t worried about the newcomer down the street, then they should be.
