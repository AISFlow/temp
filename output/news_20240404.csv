25235791,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601487,1712271639,"Bitcoin NFT Market Thrives, Franklin Templeton Remains Bullish, Binance Ends Support","Franklin Templeton‚Äôs digital assets division has released a note to its investors introducing Bitcoin-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs), highlighting a surge in activity within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The asset manager attributes this increased momentum to various factors, including the emergence of Bitcoin (BTC) NFTs called Ordinals, the development of new fungible standards like BRC-20 and Runes, the growth of Bitcoin Layer 2 (L2s) solutions, and the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Ordinals Shine According to the Bitcoin ETF issuer‚Äôs report, activity in the Bitcoin NFT space is gaining momentum. In particular, Ordinals have seen a significant increase in trading volume over the past few months. This growth is evident in Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance in terms of trading volume, which surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in December 2023, as shown in the accompanying chart. Related Reading: Trouble Ahead? Binance Coin Futures Market Under Pressure With Negative Funding Rates In addition, several collections of Bitcoin Ordinals are emerging as dominant players in the NFT market, both in terms of trading volume and market capitalization. These collections include NodeMonkes, Runestone, and Bitcoin Puppets, which have an aggregate market cap of $353 million, $339 million, and $168 million, respectively. They are the most notable collections. In terms of trading volume over the past 30 days, the report shows that these three collections recorded trading volumes of $81 million, $85 million, and $38 million, respectively, over the past month. The asset manager further claimed that what distinguishes BTC Ordinals from NFTs on other blockchains, such as Ethereum or Solana, is that they contain raw data recorded directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This feature contributes to the attractiveness and growing popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals, as evidenced by market cap and trading volume figures. Franklin Templeton, known for its involvement in the ETF market, was one of the issuers that launched a spot BTC ETF in the United States earlier this year. Its ETF, which trades under the ticker name ‚ÄúEZBC,‚Äù has seen total inflows of 281.8 million since its January 11 launch, according to BitMEX research data as of April 3. Despite its zero-fee structure, Franklin Templeton‚Äôs ETF has seen a significant difference in flows compared to the leading players in the newly approved ETF market, such as Blackrock (IBIT) and Fidelity (FBTC), which have seen flows of over 14 billion and 7.7 billion, respectively. Binance To Discontinue Support For BTC NFTs In a recent blog post, crypto exchange Binance announced it would discontinue support for Bitcoin-based NFTs on its marketplace. Less than a year after their introduction, Binance will no longer facilitate airdrops, benefits, or utilities associated with BTC NFTs, citing a need to streamline its product offerings in the NFT space. Related Reading: Injective Whales Go On $24.8 Million Buying Spree, Is This The Next Solana? Binance states that users who own Bitcoin NFTs are advised to withdraw them from the Binance NFT marketplace via the Bitcoin network before May 18, 2024. Effective April 18, 2024, users can no longer purchase, deposit, bid, or list NFTs via the BTC network on the Binance NFT Marketplace. Any existing listing orders affected by this change will be automatically canceled simultaneously. Currently, BTC is trading at $68,300, up a modest 3% in the last 24 hours. It is approaching the significant milestone of $70,000, a level the cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain several times.

He made this statement while providing an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs current price action. Bitcoin To $100,000 Is ‚ÄúInevitable‚Äù PlanB stated in a video on his YouTube channel that he believes Bitcoin hitting $100,000 this year is ‚Äúinevitable.‚Äù Interestingly, he suggested that $100,000 is likely just the starting point for Bitcoin‚Äôs price in this market cycle. He noted that the Bitcoin stock-to-flow (STF) indicator hinted at $500,000 being the average price level for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Shiba Inu To Rally 100% To $0.000062? Analyst Reveals Why This Is Possible However, he added that this doesn‚Äôt mean Bitcoin‚Äôs price will jump overnight to $500,000. He claims that the Bitcoin top will not come this year but sometime in 2025. Elaborating on what price would signify the top for Bitcoin‚Äôs price, PlanB stated that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could rise to as high as $1 million from an STF perspective. The crypto analyst mentioned that Bitcoin needs a top much higher than the $500,000 average level, so $1 million is a huge possibility. PlanB joins a short list of analysts who believe Bitcoin could attain such an ambitious price level. The CEO of Jan3 and Bitcoiner Samson Mow is another individual who has also predicted that Bitcoin could hit $1 million. Unlike PlanB, though, Mow believes such an exponential price surge could happen this year. Mow alluded to the imbalance between Bitcoin‚Äôs supply and demand as the primary reason he holds this belief. He expects Bitcoin‚Äôs price to ‚Äúreact accordingly‚Äù once miners‚Äô rewards are cut in half during the Bitcoin Halving. Corrections Are Normal Even In A Bull Market PlanB warned Bitcoin holders that there would be a lot of volatility in this bull market and that these moves won‚Äôt only be to the upside as investors should also expect ‚Äúmultiple -20% to -30% dips.‚Äù He added that this is ‚Äúvery normal,‚Äù and the best thing to do is not to panic at those dips. Related Reading: Analysts Say XRP Price Is Ready To Breakout, Here Are The Targets PlanB‚Äôs statement echoes the sentiments of Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, who warned that the market doesn‚Äôt move straight up even in bull markets.

42408548,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKRL5,1712262647,Crypto Has 'Too Many Tokens' and Mergers Are Coming,"Projects with commoditized technology that have high liquidity, but not a very active team could become targets of hostile takeover.  Traditional players could also be scooping up Web3 projects that are ""most innovative.""  M&A in the memecoin sector could reach a ""fever pitch,"" leading to the creation of tokens such as ""ShibaPepes' and 'FlokiDoges.""  Between tokens that replicate complex financial instruments like rehypothecation to many ""a dog with a hat"" type projects, there are a lot of tokens in the crypto ecosystem these days. Too many, according to some experts, who are predicting a wave of consolidation in the coming weeks and months.  With more than 13,000 tokens and about $2.5 trillion market cap, the question becomes - why are there so many tokens when the utilization and adoption of the technology are not even close to where it should be?  Enter mergers and acquisitions (M&A) which could help clean up the sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi) to NFT projects and even memecoins, according to industry observers.  Similar to the late-90s dot-com era, heavy interest from venture capital and the general public during the 2021 bull run has led to capital flowing into too many different crypto projects trying to solve similar problems, creating more tokens than needed.  ""Venture capital and excessive funding rounds during bull markets have led to the creation of a slew of projects often looking to solve similar challenges, just taking a slightly different approach,"" said Julian Grigo, head of institutions and fintech at smart-wallet infrastructure provider Safe.  Taking a cue from the traditional sectors such as the internet, semiconductors and health care, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) can solve the problem for crypto.  ""There are already too many tokens and too many 'projects' for not enough adoption and utility,"" said Chiliz network CEO Alex Dreyfus, who previously said he is looking at ""some aggressive M&A"" this year. ""Eventually, consolidation will be key,"" he added.  In fact, there is already a three-way merger that happened last month as artificial intelligence (AI)-related crypto projects Fetch.ai, SingularityNET and Ocean Protocol said they are merging to create one 7.4 billion dollar token that will make an AI collective to fight the Big Tech firms.  Deals are 'infinitely harder'  But that's just one recent example of somewhat large-scale M&A. Why aren't there more?  The simple answer might be that the industry is still very young and needs more time to reach a level where mergers can become more frequent. ""The crypto M&A market is still in its infancy and, as such, there often isn‚Äôt a template or rulebook in place which can make deals more difficult and complex,"" said Safe's Grigo.  Another unique challenge to crypto is the nature of the token markets. ""M&A is harder in crypto, because there is a lot of money in crypto trading and therefore, unlike traditional finance, where a ‚Äòstock‚Äô could die ‚Ä¶ crypto never dies. Everything is always a trading opportunity,"" said Dreyfus.  One way this can potentially be managed is by doing the deals at the token level rather than corporate, meaning each team ""can work on their own initiatives while supporting and growing the same ecosystem. It will make more decentralized ecosystems and also have very powerful network effect,"" he added.  But that's not an easy task to accomplish, according to Shayne Higdon, co-founder and CEO of The HBAR Foundation, part of the Hedera ecosystem. ""With crypto, where the ethos is open-sourced and decentralized, what are you actually buying or merging? Are you merging operations or just a token? The former is incredibly difficult to do when the business is centralized and will be infinitely harder in a decentralized world,"" he said.  ‚ÄúIn crypto, it‚Äôs about growing the ecosystem and subsequent network effects. Having a common goal is paramount to ensure communities vote to merge. These communities also hope, as a result of a merger, that they will make more money in the long run,"" Higdon said.  M&A in crypto may lead to ""short-term token appreciation,"" but may dilute value in the long-run. ""Without the presence of clear, non-redundant roles and responsibilities for the company, teams, and personnel, it will be difficult to reach efficient, economies of scale,"" he added.  That's not to say the fundamentals of M&A can't work for crypto.  The first rule of any M&A would be to ensure synergies between the companies or projects and if the new company can get an edge over the competitors by merging. ""From an infrastructure side, we will increasingly see interoperability play a crucial role in aligning these ambitions and likewise, I expect to see increased M&A activity amongst projects that share a common goal,‚Äù said Safe's Grigo.  Next would be figuring out the tokenomics and incentives for holders to vote for the deal - similar to how bankers would structure a merger or acquisition offer, may it be friendly or hostile. ""For projects where founders, investors, or teams control the bulk of circulating supply, it is easy to negotiate the deal with a small number of players,"" said Oleg Fomenko, co-founder of the decentralized app Sweat Economy.  ""Whereas for sufficiently decentralized projects, it is easy to launch a ‚Äòhostile takeover‚Äô making the offer for tokens to all token holders in order to accumulate a sufficient amount to influence the governance of the protocol,"" Fomenko added.  Other considerations are figuring out if a merger can increase the project awareness, reach a larger community, creating a stronger team to achieve a common goal, said Fomenko adding that lack of central medium to deliver a potential takeover offer as one of the biggest barrier right now for the Web3 ecosystem. In decentralized systems, you often don't know all the token holders. There's no proxy agency who can contact holders to get then vote - as there would be with traditional companies.  Regulation: blessing or a curse?  In traditional finance, one of the biggest hurdles for a deal to finish is the regulatory uncertainties. TradFi is littered with such high-profile M&A failures, including the more than $40 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors by tech giant Qualcomm that failed after China blocked the deal. Another example was when Canada thwarted mining giant BHP Billiton's $39 billion hostile takeover of Potash Corp.  Crypto's relatively immature regulatory landscape could be a net positive for the industry, according to Sweat Economy's Fomenko. ""Given the track record of Web3, it is likely to have the opposite effect and projects with significant treasuries, active teams, and communities are likely to take advantage of the current regulatory climate and acquire other businesses before M&A regulation emerges in this field,‚Äù he said.  Conversely, a better regulatory regime might incentivize bigger M&As as it could encourage larger financial institutions to step in as they'll have a better idea of how regulators will see a potential deal, according to Safe's Grigo.  A 'ShibaPepe' coin?  So, if deal-making takes off in the digital assets space, what should investors be watching?  Naturally, projects that aren't able to compete with the larger competitors will look to merge their businesses to stay afloat. ‚ÄúThe next wave of M&A is likely to occur in sectors where there is a high degree of fragmentation, like Layer 1 chains that didn‚Äôt break Top 10, DEXs, DeFi protocols, node operators, and possibly even NFT projects,‚Äù said Aki Balogh, co-founder and CEO of DLC.Link  Meanwhile, Safe's Grigo sees M&A playing out ""right across the board,"" as he doesn't see any one specific area that is immune to consolidation. He also expects traditional players to scoop up Web3 projects that are ""most innovative.""  However, projects that are only high-quality will be able to garner top dollar for potential M&A. ""The big winners of this trend are likely to become businesses that have very sophisticated cross-chain analytics capabilities as well as businesses able to deliver the message to the holder of the specific token about the potential offer,"" according to Sweat's Fomenko.  He said projects with higher liquidity that lack active teams could become targets of hostile takeovers. ""I foresee that this will likely happen in the fields where technologies are largely similar between different players ‚Äî decentralized exchanges (DEXs), collateralized liquidity providers, and liquid staking protocols. However, any project with a token that is a governance token might become a target.""  Fomenko thinks that this might become a dominant force within the memecoin sector.  ""My prediction is that this will reach a fever pitch in the world of memecoins where I foresee the emergence of 'ShibaPepes' and 'FlokiDoges' in no time.‚Äù  Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is Poised to Unleash Darwinism on Miners",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/04/crypto-has-too-many-tokens-and-mergers-are-coming,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb43c9fbf18dbed4b37e26a0381013bd20390dab-4067x2288.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
25230977,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601432,1712262620,Bitcoin: Will This ‚ÄúDry Powder‚Äù and Historical Trends Fuel A Price Boom?,"While Bitcoin has dipped from its recent highs of around $74,000, some analysts are urging investors to stay calm and even see this as a buying opportunity. So far, Bitcoin prices have remained under pressure, trickling lower in the past trading week. Are There Similarities With The Bitcoin Bull Run Of 2020? Though the downward momentum is slowing down, and there has been no confirmation of the April 2 dump, the failure of bulls to convincingly flow back and drive the coin above $71,000 remains a concern for some traders. Even so, taking a bullish stand, one analyst on X¬†compares¬†the current formation with that of 2020. Pointing to the cyclic nature of prices and the inevitability of retracements from bottoms and peaks, the trader expects prices to bounce. Related Reading: Fantom Supply On Exchanges See Drastic Increase, A Cause For Alarm? The trader said that in 2020, when Bitcoin prices fell, shaking out weak hands, the recovery sparked a bull run that forcefully saw the coin surge above previous all-time highs of $20,000. The analyst seems to allude to the retracement before the breakout as a catapult that eventually fed the ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù bull run, which saw Bitcoin float to as high as $70,000. Based on this comparison, the trader is adamant that it may, reading from history, be the best time to ‚Äúsell‚Äù at around spot levels. Still, for now, buyers can consider doubling down until there is a clear trend definition and shake-off of the current bear formation. Currently, BTC has strong rejections in the $71,700 to $72,000 liquidation zone, marking last week‚Äôs highs. Watch Out For The ‚ÄúDry Powder‚Äù Besides technical candlestick formation, another trader thinks buyers better HODL even with sellers in control. In a post on X, the analyst said Tether Holdings, the issuer of USDT, and Circle, the issuer of USDC, recently minted billions. On April 2, Tether issued 1 billion USDT on Tron, while Circle issued 250 million USDC on Solana. This development, the analyst¬†said, means there is ‚Äúplenty of dry powder.‚Äù Stablecoins like USDT and USDC offer stability in the crypto markets, providing a refuge for crypto holders whenever prices tumble. However, they can also act as conduits of liquidity from the traditional market, providing an avenue for interested users to get exposure to top coins or even engage in activities such as decentralized finance (DeFi).

In late afternoon action, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were each lower by nearly 1% ‚Äì not a huge loss, but about a 2% reversal off of earlier session highs. Behind the moves lower were hawkish comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari.  ""If we continue to see inflation moving sideways, then that would make me question whether we [need] to do those rate cuts at all,"" said Kashkari at a virtual event on LinkedIn. Kashkari has been among the more hawkish Fed members this cycle so his remarks shouldn't have been too unexpected, but stocks quickly reacted to the downside. His comments were also at odds with those yesterday from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who told an audience at Stanford that he continues to expect rate cuts at some point this year.  Nevertheless, the rate outlook could come more clearly into focus on Friday with the release of the government's March employment data. To date, those hoping weakening jobs numbers might prompt the Fed to move more quickly to a rate cut cycle have been disappointed, with employment growth maintaining robust levels throughout 2023 and so far in 2024.  Economist estimates are for 200,000 jobs to have been added in March, a strong number, though down from 275,000 in February. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.9%.

Dilkinska helped executives launder hundreds of millions in fraud proceeds.  She is the latest OneCoin executive to be brought to justice for her role in the $4 billion crypto Ponzi scheme.  OneCoin‚Äôs former head of legal and compliance was sentenced to four years in prison on Wednesday for her role in the infamous $4 billion crypto ponzi scheme.  Instead of ensuring OneCoin was operating within legal and regulatory parameters, prosecutors say Bulgarian national Irina Dilkinska helped with the day-to-day operations of the scheme and, after its collapse in 2016, helped executives launder their ill-gotten gains by working with American lawyer Mark Scott to squirrel away $400 million to the Cayman Islands.  Scott, a former partner at international law firm Locke Lord, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the scheme earlier this year.  Dilkinska, 42, was extradited to the U.S. in March 2023 and charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. She pleaded guilty to both charges in November 2023. New York District Court Judge Edgardo Ramos also ordered Dilkinska to forfeit $111.4 million.  Dilkinska is the latest OneCoin executive to be put behind bars for her involvement in the scam, which started in Bulgaria in 2014 and shut down in early 2017.  OneCoin‚Äôs co-founders, Bulgarian national Ruja Ignatova and joint U.K. and Swedish citizen Karl Greenwood, promoted the fictitious cryptocurrency ‚Äì which never existed on any blockchain ‚Äì through a kind of multi-level marketing scheme, paying initial investors to bring in more investors. By the time OneCoin was revealed to be a scam, an estimated 3.5 million people had fallen victim.  Greenwood was sentenced to 20 years in prison in September 2023 and ordered to forfeit $300 million.

The FBI has suggested she could have altered her appearance with plastic surgery or may be traveling on a German passport in the Middle East or Eastern Europe.  There are also rumors that Ignatova may be dead.

Now, he has published a list of altcoins that he believes can provide investors with maximum returns. Chainlink Is Top Of The List In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Van de Poppe listed Chainlink (LINK) as the number one altcoin he believes has so much potential. He explained that Chainlink‚Äôs valuation is currently at a cycle low and has dropped by 40% since its recent peak. As such, this decline presents a ‚Äúmassive opportunity‚Äù since LINK is still likely to make more moves to the upside. Related Reading: Analysts Say XRP Price Is Ready To Breakout, Here Are The Targets The second altcoin that Van de Poppe listed is Celestia (TIA). He noted that TIA is a relatively new project and would likely be a ‚Äúmassive gainer‚Äù in this market cycle. Considering that TIA is currently down 61% from its recent peak, the crypto expert claims this is a ‚Äúgiant opportunity‚Äù for those interested in investing in the token. The third token on Van de Poppe‚Äôs list is Arbiturm (ARB). The crypto expert alluded to the massive ARB token unlock in March, which caused a lot of selling pressure. He also suggested that this is probably one of the reasons its valuation has dropped by 60% in the past month. However, he is bullish on Arbitrum as he considers the network a ‚Äústrong Layer 2 Rollup system‚Äù and believes the ARB token could be one of the strongest gainers in this cycle. Polkadot (DOT) is the next altcoin Van de Poppe mentioned. The analyst claims DOT‚Äôs valuation is still at a cycle low, which has opened up a ‚Äúlarge opportunity‚Äù to invest in it. ATOM (Cosmos) is another altcoin that the crypto expert believes is still greatly undervalued and could provide significant returns for investors. Other Altcoins On The List Van de Poppe mentioned DYDX (DYDX) as another altcoin with great potential. He revealed that the crypto token is reaching a cycle-low level in the Bitcoin pair. He expects the token to make a significant move to the upside once it is done consolidating. The crypto expert also listed WooNetwork (WOO) as another DeFi token that is greatly undervalued. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Encourages Investors To Buy The Dip As Bitcoin Price Falls To $64,000 Meanwhile, SEI (SEI), like TIA, is another relatively new project he believes will likely outperform other major crypto tokens in this upcoming cycle. He also acknowledged that newer coins also have the potential to enjoy more gains than tokens that have been around for a while. Skale Network (SKL) and Covalent (CQT) completed Van de Poppe‚Äôs list of ten altcoins that he believes are undervalued and could do well in this bull run.

42408536,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKQe6,1712255873,What Does Ripple‚Äôs Stablecoin Mean for XRP?,"Ripple has declared the death of {{XRP}}. Well, to be fair, to be accurate, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the exact opposite when announcing the Silicon Valley crypto mainstay would launch a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin later this year. But in the grand scheme of things, XRP‚Äôs usefulness is dwindling. (Sorry, XRP Army, it‚Äôs my job to speak it how it is.)  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The Ripple stablecoin, expected later this year, will apparently be backed 1-to-1 by cash equivalents including U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. government bonds and other low-risk investments, according to the company‚Äôs announcement. The idea is reportedly to create a more trustworthy alternative to assets like Tether‚Äôs {{USDT}} and Circle‚Äôs {{USDC}}.  Indeed, as many others have pointed out, the $150 billion stablecoin market is crowded ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also highly lucrative. Tether, the first and largest stablecoin that currently dominates the market, is essentially being used as a cash cow to fund Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino‚Äôs many wild ambitions (from AI to decentralized messaging).  It‚Äôs possible, facing as much as a $2 billion fine from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple is looking for a new, proven revenue source. Garlinghouse is apparently unfazed by the crowded competition, telling CNBC: in the future the stablecoin ‚Äúmarket will look different, certainly based on size.‚Äù  In many ways Ripple‚Äôs existing business model ‚Äî selling financial services based around its XRP Ledger as well as On Demand Liquidity and RippleNet protocols ‚Äî is falling short. Although Ripple has seen some success forming partnerships, it seems increasingly clear legitimate financial institutions do not want to take on the volatile currency risks of working with unpegged digit assets.  Over Ripple's decade-plus history, it often seemed better at building community (the XRP Army) and being a crypto cause (taking the SEC to court over the crucial question of whether tokens are securities). It's been less successful at building products companies and individuals actually want to use.  ‚ÄúNobody is using XRP itself as the method of payment, just like nobody is really using BTC much for that,‚Äù Columbia Business Professor and former Paxos stablecoin fund manager Austen Campbell said in a direct message.  Of course, that isn‚Äôt totally true. Diameter Pay CEO David Lighton said he partnered with Ripple on an early pilot experiment of xRapid (rebranded as Ripple ODL) to send remittances between the U.S. and the Philippines. While he no longer uses that particular service, he does use the RippleNet messaging platform for some cross-bank transactions, which doesn‚Äôt rely on XRP.  ‚ÄúRipple has sort of a best in class data structure, most of the banks are kind of behind,‚Äù Lighton said. ‚ÄúIt's a good product, but they don't really sell it that much anymore. I think that they're sort of keeping it alive for their legacy clients ‚Äî it's not entirely clear to me why that is.‚Äù  Lighton said he stopped using ODL when he left the consumer remittance business, but found it also to be a useful product. It helped him manage currency risk by providing real time settlements for small tokenized trades. ‚ÄúIt's not entirely clear how all of that has been put together, because I'm not currently using it. But it's reasonable to say there's some value added because it helps firms reduce their cost of working capital,‚Äù he said.  See also: In Their Own Words: Real Companies Talk Ripple XRP Pilots (2018)  However, many of Ripple‚Äôs higher profile partnerships have fallen through.  Santander, one of the largest banks in the E.U., put Ripple on ice after the bank realized using XRP wouldn‚Äôt work for its customers‚Äô needs. A storied relationship with MoneyGram ended due to the increasing costs associated with cross-border XRP payments, and the need for MoneyGram to form third party relationships with crypto exchanges in dispersed regions.  MoneyGram terminated the deal with Ripple, which invested $30 million in the remittance giant in 2019 to use RippleNet, after a class-action lawsuit was filed by shareholders alleging MoneyGram should have been aware that XRP could have been deemed a security and thus impact MoneyGram‚Äôs bottom line.  The question of whether XRP is a security won‚Äôt really be answered until Ripple‚Äôs four year legal battle with the SEC ends after appeals. Right now it‚Äôs a complicated situation. Judge Analisa Torres found last year that XRP is NOT a security by default (specifically when traded on exchanges), but it does represent an investment contract when Ripple sells the token to qualified investors.  And that‚Äôs the rub. For years, Ripple has essentially funded itself by selling quarterly tranches of XRP for hundreds of millions of dollars to investors. The SEC alleged that Ripple and two of its executives raised over $1.3 billion from the sale of XRP through unregistered securities offerings, about $770 million of which in institutional sales was found to violate Section 5 of the Securities Act.  It‚Äôs unlikely, no matter the appeals process, that that activity will be able to continue on the same scale. It‚Äôs hard to get a sense of Ripple‚Äôs financials as a private company. But, in many quarters leading up to the SEC‚Äôs suit, these programmatic sales represented a decent chunk of non-bot XRP trading activity.  Ripple has claimed in the past it has had over 200 clients for RippleNet from central banks and financial institutions across over 40 countries. But often, beyond the initial announcement that companies will be using XRP for cross border liquidity, there is very little indication how often Ripple‚Äôs financial services are actually used. Often times the pilots are just internal, and not used for consumer-facing applications.  See also: Ripple Exec on Palau Stablecoin Trial on XRP Ledger  Bank Dhofar, Omar‚Äôs second largest bank, for instance, announced it would use RippleNet in 2021 and offers customers the option to ‚ÄúDeposit up to OMR 1,000 to deposit accounts in India instantly through Ripple.‚Äù But that is the only mention on the bank‚Äôs website. Many others ‚Äî including payments apps and remittances services ‚Äî make no mention of Ripple at all on their corporate sites.  Lighton said he‚Äôd consider using ODL again if it was ‚Äúa good enough commercial proposition‚Äù and that if he could ‚Äúget comfortable with the regulatory and compliance risks,‚Äù but when it comes to financial services there‚Äôs a lot of up- and downstream relationships that do internal risk ratings to figure out whether to work with you that aren‚Äôt yet comfortable with crypto.  ‚ÄúIt's really a tough environment right now to do something cool and sexy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI'm a regulated entity. My top loyalty is to our anti-money laundering obligations.‚Äù  See also: Crypto Remittances Prove Their Worth in Latin America  Asked whether he‚Äôd be more comfortable using stablecoins or stablecoin-based services, Lighton said he‚Äôs even more hands off there following the Federal Reserve‚Äôs Novel Activities Supervision Program instituted last summer, which dialed up the heat on entities using stablecoins.  ‚ÄúThere's some brilliant ideas behind stablecoins. The problem is no one is really sure how to regulate them,‚Äù Lighton said. He mentioned that PayPal is allowed remittances through its PUSD stablecoin on its Western Union-like platform Xoom, which might be an avenue that Ripple goes down.  To be fair, Ripple‚Äôs XRP-based financial tools are largely meant to work in the background ‚Äî though many would still likely prefer financial rails built on fiat rather than a free floating currency. That may be why a growing number of crypto companies and projects decide to go down the stablecoin route.  In fact, Ripple‚Äôs soon-to-be competitor, Circle, issuer of the second largest stablecoin, went through a number of corporate reevaluations ‚Äî going from a peer-to-peer payments platform to a bitcoin wallet ‚Äî before it landed on the stablecoin business. Maybe that is the natural crypto lifecycle.",NEGATIVE,USDT | XRP,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT | XRP,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/04/what-does-ripples-stablecoin-mean-for-xrp,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea59f03b1552e14738359087a0f44588fbb52e6d-2684x1510.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Coinbase has been seeking to expand in Canada since last year, even as it fights U.S. regulators for similar considerations.  Coinbase's expansion into Canada has cleared the hurdle of a ""restricted dealer"" registration, the company said on Thursday, making it the biggest registered crypto exchange in that jurisdiction.  The U.S. exchange had been seeking this status from the Canadian Securities Administrators since the country set up new crypto policies last year, and the new registration signed by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) sets Coinbase on a path of government-approved operation that has so far eluded it in the U.S.  ‚ÄúThis is a significant milestone in Coinbase‚Äôs journey in Canada,‚Äù said Lucas Matheson, the CEO of Coinbase Canada, in a statement.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Have Transferred Huge Volume In Loss To Exchanges As analyst James Van Straten pointed out in a post on X, the BTC short-term holders have recently participated in a large amount of loss-taking. The ‚Äúshort-term holders‚Äù (STHs) are the Bitcoin investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. The STHs make up one of the two main divisions of the BTC market, which is done on the basis of holding time, with the other cohort being known as the long-term holders (LTHs). Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders No Longer Extremely Greedy: Rebound Signal? Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the STHs would reflect the weak-minded side of the market, while the LTHs would be the persistent diamond hands. Given their fickle nature, the STHs usually easily react whenever a notable sector change occurs, like a price rally or crash. Recently, BTC has registered a significant drawdown, so these investors would likely have made some moves. Indeed, on-chain data would confirm this. Below is a Glassnode chart shared by Straten, which reveals the trend in the transfer volume in loss (in USD) going from the wallets of the STHs to centralized exchanges. The value of the metric appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: @jvs_btc on X As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin short-term holders have recently deposited a large number of tokens holding a loss into exchange-affiliated wallets. Exchange inflows usually suggest demand for using the services these platforms provide, which can include selling. As these latest deposits from the STHs have come following a sharp drop in the price, it would appear possible that the panic-sellers indeed made these inflows. As the Bitcoin price is currently near the all-time high (ATH), most of the STH group would be holding a profit. So, all this loss volume can only come from those who bought at the recent highs. This isn‚Äôt the first time the market has observed such quick capitulation from FOMO buyers this year. The chart shows that the exchange transfer volume in loss from the STHs also spiked very high during the plunge that followed the latest price ATH. The spike back then was even greater in scale than the one witnessed recently and suggested the shakeout of the holders who the news of the ATH had driven in.

It's since retraced to the current $67,600, giving bulls some hope that new records are imminent. At least one sentiment indicator, though, indicates that the price correction has more room to run.  The so-called futures funding rate ‚Äì payments to traders based on the difference between perpetual contract markets and spot prices ‚Äì is around a record high level, reports CryptoQuant. ""Funding rates represent traders' sentiments in the perpetual swaps market and the amount is proportional to the number of contracts,"" the team explained. Positive funding rates indicate that long position traders are dominant and are willing to pay funding to short traders.  Positive funding rates, CryptoQuant continued, suggest long traders ‚Äì those betting on higher prices ‚Äì are dominating the market and willing to pay funding to shorts, i.e. those betting on lower prices.  The last time funding rates were this high was in April 2021. Bitcoin subsequently collapsed from above $60,000 to below $30,000 just three months later.  Interestingly, the CryptoQuant report comes alongside recent data from the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showing record futures short positions from hedge funds and commodity trading advisors (CTAs).

This would undoubtedly be a much-needed relief for the INJ token, which has dipped significantly in the last seven days. Crypto Whales Buy $24.8 Million Worth Of INJ Data from the market intelligence platform Santiment shows that Whale Addresses recently bought $24.8 million worth of INJ, bringing their total holdings to 10.69 million INJ. This purchase is significant considering the impact that crypto whales have on the market. As such, a purchase of such magnitude could provide a much-needed boost to INJ‚Äôs price. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Encourages Investors To Buy The Dip As Bitcoin Price Falls To $64,000 Injective, like the broader crypto market, has been on a steady decline over the last week, dropping by over 14% during that period. The crypto token has also suffered a reversal of fortune, as it currently has a year-to-date (YTD) decline of over 9%. That is shocking for a token that enjoyed a 3000% gain in 2023 and even outperformed Solana (SOL), whose rally was one of last year‚Äôs major talking points. However, a major correction like this was expected for INJ‚Äôs price, which enjoyed a sustained rally last year, suggesting it was possibly overbought at some point. A price decline like this one is necessary for the crypto token to once again establish itself and make another move to the upside. Injective Could Follow Solana‚Äôs Trajectory Crypto analyst Crypto Dona recently suggested that Injective could follow a similar path to SOL‚Äôs price action in 2021. Back then, SOL is said to have been stuck between the $20 and $40 price range for more than 100 days. However, just when everyone was about to give up on SOL, it went on a massive run and saw a ten times increase in its price. Related Reading: Shiba Inu To Rally 100% To $0.000062?

Injective, being an AI (artificial intelligence) coin, is also likely to keep attracting much attention heading into the latter stages of this bull run. That could reflect positively on its price since more liquidity will flow into its ecosystem. The recent purchase by these crypto whales also underlines the bullish sentiment toward the crypto token despite its current unimpressive price action.

A total of 47.3% respondents of the American Association of Individual Investors, or AAII, Sentiment survey showed optimism about where the market is headed in the next six months, compared to 50% of those polled a week before. The historical average stands at 37.5%, while the 1-year bullish high is 52.9%. Meanwhile, the percentage of surveyors who felt bearish about the market also fell slightly this week. It came in at 22.2%, compared to the 22.4% figure last week. Neutral sentiments rose this week, with 30.5% of the investors polled by AAII seeing no change in the market direction. The number was 27.6% the week before. The survey results came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday repeated the need for more evidence before cutting rates, indicating that a slight possibility of rate cuts later this year. Powell said he doesn't expect ""that it will be appropriate"" to lower the policy rate until ""we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2%."" This has led to Wall Street‚Äôs main stock indexes gain on Thursday. However, a recent Seeking Alpha analysis by Michael Kramer pointed out that ‚Äúrising commodity prices and warning signs indicate that inflation readings in the coming months may not be favorable, reducing the likelihood of rate cuts in 2024.‚Äù Separately, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed that U.S. services growth slowed in March, with PMI falling to 51.4 versus 52.6 in February.

In today's main article, Scott Sunshine of Blue Dot Advisors shares his thoughts on financial governance in a blockchain world.  In Ask an Expert, Cato Fel√°n III from La Hoja Capital Partners explains how bitcoin is used as collateral in structured credit portfolios.  Happy reading.  You‚Äôre reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk‚Äôs weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  From Accountability to Accessibility: Financial Governance in a Blockchain World  In today's rapidly evolving financial landscape, the adoption of blockchain technology is revolutionizing traditional corporate governance practices. This innovative technology offers a transparent, immutable and decentralized platform that can significantly benefit financial advisors‚Äô clients. By leveraging blockchain-based governance, financial advisors can enhance trust, improve accountability, streamline operations and unlock new investment opportunities for their clients. Here's how:  Transparency as the New Gold Standard  One of the most compelling advantages of blockchain technology is its ability to provide unparalleled transparency. Blockchain creates an interference-proof ledger that records all corporate actions and transactions, making it easier for financial advisors to verify information and trust the companies they invest in. This increased transparency can lead to greater confidence in investment decisions, reduce the risk of fraud or mismanagement and ultimately strengthen the relationship between financial advisors and their clients.  Corporate Accountability and Performance in a New Digital Era  Blockchain's immutable nature ensures that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted without consensus from the network. This feature promotes accountability among executives and board members, as all actions and decisions are permanently recorded and traceable. Companies that prioritize good governance practices, facilitated by blockchain technology, are more likely to perform well over the long term. This performance can translate into higher returns and reduced investment risk for clients, making it a win-win situation for both financial advisors and their clients.  Democratized Decision-Making and Shareholder Engagement  Blockchain platforms can facilitate direct participation in voting and governance activities, allowing clients to have a more active role in the companies they invest in. This democratization of decision-making can lead to better-aligned corporate strategies, more responsive management practices, and ultimately, a more robust and resilient investment portfolio for clients leading to better investment outcomes.  Streamlined Operations and Cost Efficiency  Blockchain technology can automate and streamline various governance processes, reducing administrative costs and improving operational efficiency. Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, can automate routine tasks such as compliance monitoring, dividend distribution, and proxy voting. By eliminating manual intervention and reducing administrative overhead, financial advisors can pass on these cost savings to their clients through lower fees, better investment opportunities or higher returns on investment.  Enhanced Security and Data Protection  Security is a top priority in the financial industry, and blockchain technology offers robust solutions to protect sensitive client data and investment information. Blockchain's cryptographic algorithms and decentralized architecture make it highly secure against tampering and unauthorized access. By storing data on a blockchain, financial advisors can enhance data protection, reduce the risk of data breaches and identity theft, and comply with stringent data privacy regulations, providing clients with peace of mind.  Regulatory Compliance and Risk Mitigation  Navigating complex regulatory landscapes can be challenging for financial advisors. Blockchain technology can help by providing real-time transparency, traceability, and auditability, making it easier to demonstrate compliance with laws and regulations. This enhanced compliance monitoring can mitigate regulatory risks, facilitate smoother interactions with regulatory authorities, and ensure that clients' investments comply with legal requirements, protecting both financial advisors and their clients from potential legal pitfalls.  In conclusion, corporate governance practices in a blockchain world offer significant benefits to financial advisors‚Äô clients. From enhanced transparency and trust to improved accountability, streamlined operations, enhanced security, and regulatory compliance, blockchain technology is revolutionizing the way financial advisors and their clients interact and collaborate. By embracing blockchain-based governance solutions, financial advisors can better serve their clients' interests, help them achieve their financial goals, and build stronger, more resilient investment portfolios for a prosperous and sustainable future.  - Scott Sunshine, managing partner, Blue Dot Advisors  Ask an Expert  Question: How do managers use bitcoin collateral in their real estate lending portfolios?  Bitcoin is used in a hybrid collateral model where loans are underwritten based on the value of the real estate asset and a portion of bitcoin to be purchased with loan proceeds, thus creating two collateralized assets to secure the loan.  Question: Why would a borrower want to do that?  These hybrid loans are designed for borrowers who already participate in bitcoin and are comfortable with the asset. The bitcoin is held in a joint partnership between lender and borrower, with both parties benefiting from the asset‚Äôs long-term appreciation.  Question: How does this affect portfolio risk?  This is a new model, the risk of which is still being assessed. Managers who engage this strategy rely on the macro trend of bitcoin price appreciation despite historical periods of short-term volatility. Managers analyze bitcoin‚Äôs cyclical price performance to guide portfolio management and increase returns as bitcoin price reaches certain thresholds. There is some decrease in traditional credit risk as bitcoin‚Äôs growth potential allows managers to abstain from using traditional levers to increase return, mainly the use of leverage and adding riskier, higher-interest loans to the portfolio.  - Cato Fel√°n III, managing partner, La Hoja Capital Partners  Keep Reading  BlackRock‚Äôs tokenized USD Institutional fund (BUIDL) has registered over $240 million in deposits since its recent debut.

Ethereum Layer 2s Poised For Significant Increase In Valuation According to VanEck researchers, Ethereum Layer 2 scaling networks are expected to soar to the aforementioned market valuation by 2030. Leading the comprehensive prediction were Patrick Bush, the senior investment analyst at VanEck, and Matthew Sigel, the head of digital research. Related Reading: Ethereum Layer 2 Networks Just Set A New Record Specifically, the bold forecast was carried out while evaluating Ethereum Layer 2s in five distinct important areas. These include Layer 2s transaction pricing, developer experience, user experience, trust assumptions, and L2s ecosystem size. In addition, it was made by first assessing the amount of assets in the Ethereum ecosystem and then projecting that ETH would account for about 60% of the market share among public blockchains. It is noteworthy that Layer 2s, by managing the majority of transactions off the main blockchain, addresses scalability issues. In this case, Zero-knowledge roll-ups (ZKUs) and optimistic roll-ups (ORUs) are the two major forms of layer 2 networks. Given the limits of the main blockchain‚Äôs transaction processing, these L2 technologies may be able to generate more funds than Ethereum since they handle scalability by processing transactions off the main network. As the researchers stated, in the future, a few general-purpose L2s will be in control, but a plethora of roll-ups tailored to certain use cases will also arise, making it possible to host social media networks on different rollups. The report read: Beyond the dominance of a few roll-ups among general-purpose L2s, we forecast a future of thousands of use-case-specific roll-ups. These L2 will be segmented by sector, application, or function. Other types of chains may be specifically geared towards hosting a whole sector, such as a roll-up that hosts a social media network, as well as applications that want to build products and services for that social media network. This forecast by VanEck primarily points to the possibility that L2 solutions could perform better in terms of value than Ethereum in the next six years. The report also claims that Layer-2 blockchains will benefit from Ethereum‚Äôs restricted processing power, as well as its data-storing and computation capabilities. ETH Price Experiences Bearish Activity Presently, Ethereum‚Äôs price is declining after failing to rise above the $4,000 mark once more. Even though the market is currently correcting downward, a positive bounce is still anticipated to occur soon. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Fails Again, Signs Of More Losses Below $3,300 Compared to other notable coins in the crypto market like Bitcoin, ETH has underperformed over the past month. Consequently, there have been speculations within the cryptocurrency community, if a further decline is imminent. ETH has seen a decrease of more than 10% since March, following a surge to $4,091 ahead of the Dencun upgrade. As of press time, Ethereum was trading at $3,343, displaying an increase of 1% in the past day. Its market cap is now valued at $401,42 billion, with a 1% rise in the last 24 hours. However, its daily trading volume has plummeted by over 30%, pegging at $13,50 billion.

Digital asset adoption continued after the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, the report said.  Risks include the exchange‚Äôs ongoing lawsuit with the SEC, Oppenheimer said.   Coinbase (COIN) is well positioned to benefit from the long-term adoption of blockchain technology, broker Oppenheimer said in a research report on Wednesday raising its earning estimates for the crypto exchange.  ‚ÄúWe estimate that COIN‚Äôs 1Q24 trading volume would be up 95% quarter-on-quarter and 107% year-on-year to $300B,‚Äù analysts Owen Lau and Guru Sidaarth wrote, noting that the ‚Äúadoption of digital assets continued after the approval of spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMore importantly, liquidity in this space has continued to increase, with the average market cap of USD Coin (USDC) increasing 12% quarter-on-quarter to $28b (or $31B at 1Q24-end),‚Äù the authors wrote. USDC Is a stablecoin issued by Circle, which is itself backed by Coinbase. The exchange earns gross interest income on USDC outstanding balances.  Given the company‚Äôs improving outlook, the broker raised its price target for the stock to $276 from $200. Coinbase shares were trading 2.5% higher at $258 at publication time.  Oppenheimer notes that since January the stock is up over 100% versus a measly 6% rise for the S&P 500 index. ‚ÄúAt this level of trading, we are cautious about the near-term volatility, but remain positive on the long-term adoption of blockchain technology.‚Äù  Still, there are some potential headwinds. While the stock may have strong momentum behind it, there are risks that investors need to be aware of, the report said. The broker had previously expected approval of a spot ether {{ETH}} ETF in May, but now says there is a low probability of this happening.  The ongoing lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is also an overhang on the stock. ‚ÄúWe currently believe that this case will be a long legal battle and will likely go to the Supreme Court to get the final decision,‚Äù the report added.

42408547,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKRHm,1712241883,DAOs Beware: Neo-Imperialism Is on the Rise in Crypto-Land,"Sometimes I have to read a text twice before grasping its full implications.  This happened to me with a recent blog post by the legal team of Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the largest venture capital firms active in crypto. The text introduces the Wyoming DUNA, a newly created legal entity type designed to cater to the needs of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).  At first sight, everything seems perfectly reasonable with DUNAs, short for a ""decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association."" But read again more carefully, as someone who is truly passionate about the principles of decentralization left me with an uncomfortable feeling. Where did this discomfort come from?  Before answering that question, let me clarify two things:  First, I believe that DUNAs are a great legal innovation. The U.S. state of Wyoming is doing a stellar job in creating legislation that supports the crypto industry in general and DAOs specifically. I think the DUNA structure is likely going to be a good fit for many project teams and hope that it will be a success.  Second, I acknowledge that there is a faction within the crypto community that has strong ‚Äúanti-VC‚Äù sentiments ‚Äì but I am not one of them. To the contrary, I think that venture capital is ‚Äî overall ‚Äî a positive force in crypto, and while some criticism is warranted, much of it is unfair or exaggerated. Firms like a16z contribute to the growth of crypto in multiple ways. Investing other people‚Äôs money in a sector as volatile and fast-moving as crypto is not a laid back affair, and we should applaud the people that have the courage and vision to do so.  See also: Wyoming Grants DAOs New Legal Structure  With that out of the way, let me tell you what concerns me about a16z‚Äôs blog post:  By their own account, a16z intends to make DUNAs ‚Äúthe industry standard for blockchain networks.‚Äù They intend to do so not just by providing operational support and educational material, but, where appropriate, by making the adoption of a DUNA structure ‚Äúa condition of investment.‚Äù In other words: If good arguments do not convince DAO operators, probably the threat of withdrawing funding opportunities will.  This doesn‚Äôt sound right.  Haven‚Äôt we all signed up for the promise that we can build a new type of internet that works independent of nation states? And now a U.S.-based venture capital fund is telling us that this doesn‚Äôt work ain‚Äôt so. Instead, we should all locate all our ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù activities in wait for it ‚Äî Wyoming, USA?  Forgive me for becoming emotional, but this feels a bit too much like neo-imperialism entering crypto-land.  But emotions aside, let‚Äôs dissect a16z‚Äôs arguments. As I will show in the following, none of them are particularly convincing ‚Äî unless you‚Äôre a U.S.-based VC:  Legal status  A16z argues that DAOs need ‚Äúlegal existence.‚Äù They go on to make claims that failing to adopt internte structures has limited the growth of blockchain networks ‚Äî however, without providing any evidence to back up this claim.  These types of blanket statements are not helpful and likely to be wrong in many circumstances. Without a doubt, there are DAOs or blockchain networks that benefit from adopting a traditional legal entity structure, but definitely not all. Imagine Satoshi had started bitcoin {{BTC}} by setting up a legal entity before releasing the Bitcoin code. Do you think we would be where we are today under this scenario? Certainly not.  The choice of legal structure should follow an analysis of what it is that you want to achieve. By prescribing a specific legal entity type before a sound analysis of the requirements of a project, you are putting the cart before the horse. A DUNA may or may not solve project teams‚Äô issues, and there are many other alternatives that might be better, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case at hand.  Taxes  Maybe the most surprising argument that the authors make is that DUNAs are great because they empower the DAO to pay taxes in the U.S.  Wait what? Did they really write that? As a PRO argument for DUNAs?  For someone who has worked in the structuring of international businesses, this sounds bizarre. Typically, great efforts are expanded to minimize tax exposure to the U.S. as much as possible. For DAO members who are not U.S. tax residents, I have a hard time imagining how a DUNA can improve their tax situation.  As the authors rightly point out, you really need to understand ‚Äúindividual facts and circumstances‚Äù to find an optimal tax structure. But if we can generalize at all, I doubt that DUNAs would even make the Top 10 list of structuring options unless the DAO is purely U.S.-based.  By the way, I do understand that from a tax perspective, the DUNA might be a good structure for a16z. As a U.S. entity with substantial interests in many DAOs and networks, I can imagine that dealing with U.S. entities reduces their tax risk substantially. But to be blunt, this is primarily their tax problem to deal with. What is best for them should not dictate the terms for everyone else.  Liability  The authors argue that currently, members of many DAOs face significant liability risks since the legal status of DAOs is unclear. This is absolutely true and is an issue that urgently needs to be solved. What is not true, however, is that a legal entity wrapper is the only way to address this problem.  One alternative is a set of private contracts between DAO members, as implemented for example in the project I founded, Q Protocol. This legal technique effectively lets members ‚Äúopt out‚Äù of their local jurisdiction by ‚Äúopting in‚Äù to privately agreed rules. Contrary to what a16z claims, such structures are not ‚Äúfantastical.‚Äù They have been tried-and-tested in the ‚Äúreal world.""  Of course there are limits to what can sensibly be structured via private contracts, but this is true for every structuring option.  See also: Regulators Everywhere Should Follow Wyoming's DAO Law  Wrapping a DAO under a single legal entity might be the ‚Äúlazy‚Äù version of reducing liability risk, but likewise, there are limits, and not all liability risks evaporate only because you have a legal entity. At the end of the day, again, there is no substitute for an analysis of each DAO.  Other considerations  There are more reasons why the desire to create a de-facto standard legal entity structure for DAOs is misguided.  First, the crypto landscape and the legal frameworks around it are still evolving. To believe that we have already found one optimal structure is na√Øve. As an industry, we would be much better off if we continue to innovate and keep an open mind about legal structures. DUNAs are great, but I would be surprised it they are the ultimate form for DAOs. Converging to one standard to early is a sure way to stifle innovation.  Second, jurisdictional diversity is a key element of decentralization. When designing networks that have autonomy as an explicitly stated goal, it is simply unwise to put the fate of those networks into the hands of one specific legislator. Again, this is not an argument against DUNAs. I believe that they are a great new addition to the tool set available to DAO and protocol designers; they just shouldn‚Äôt be relied on without alternatives.  Legal entity or not  DUNAs are great, but let‚Äôs take them for what they are: One option among many if you are structuring DAOs or decentralized networks. There is a world outside the U.S. where many options exist already today. But we should not lose sight of the most important one, which is for code and communities to exist autonomously without a legal wrapper around it. Anyone selling a specific solution as THE standard will be wrong.

The upcoming bitcoin halving event in April 2024, where the block reward paid to miners will decrease, suggests a potential shift in the supply/demand balance toward demand outpacing supply, which could lead to upward pressure on the price of bitcoin. ETF buying has outpaced the creation of new bitcoin since the launch of the ETFs, indicating increased investor interest in gaining exposure to bitcoin through familiar brokerage platforms. By Christopher Gannatti, CFA One of the biggest stories of the first quarter of 2024 in U.S. ETFs has been the launch of 11 distinct spot bitcoin strategies. January 11, 2024, is truly a date that will go down in ETF history, similar to the launch of SPDR's gold trust in 2004 1 or even SPDR's S&P 500 Index trust in 1993. 2 As we write these words, roughly $60 billion in assets under management are represented by these 11 spot bitcoin ETF strategies. 3 As is often the case, this $60 billion represents a wide dispersion, with a few quite large strategies, some mid-sized and some smaller. The Halving In April 2024, an event referred to as ""the halving"" will occur within the bitcoin protocol. This is widely anticipated, in that it is written into the code that the block reward paid to bitcoin miners will shift from 6.25 bitcoin to roughly 3.13 bitcoin. Bitcoin's protocol has a so-called ""halving cycle"" of about four years, so we have seen these events before-rewards started at 50, dropping first to 25, then 12.5 and then 6.25. This will keep happening between now and 2140, when all 21 million bitcoin slated to ever be created will exist. Figure 1 is a chart that we have shown before, noting that if we scale bitcoin's price on the day of a past halving to 1.0, we see that over the subsequent roughly 2.5-year period, there was further appreciation in each of the three cases. On the one hand, we can think about bitcoin on a supply/demand basis. If demand is outpacing supply, there should be upward pressure on the price. The halving indicates that there is less new bitcoin supply coming into the world, so if demand merely remains the same, the supply/demand balance immediately shifts more toward demand outpacing supply. To be balanced, we have to also recognize that many things influence the behavior of investors across the overall bitcoin market. Prior halving cycles being associated with bitcoin's price appreciation cannot tell us with certainty what will occur in the future. Figure 1: Bitcoin's Price Behavior after Three Halving Cycles So Far Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A New Source of Demand One of the most-loved attributes of bitcoin regards the certainty of supply based on the protocol's code over time. For instance, we know that in 2140, there will be 21 million bitcoin, and we know that nothing can occur to change this. We know, as stated with the halving, the minting of new supply coming online is being reduced, by half, roughly every four years. This is in direct contrast to fiat currency systems, where governments can decide to print more units of currency on an unlimited basis. Throughout history, we've seen examples of fiat currencies losing their value and primacy due to further and further printing. We have seen the U.S. dollar lose value over time after breaking the link to gold in 1971, 4 allowing the U.S. government to print more and more currency without needing it to be backed by units of gold. It was hypothesized that, if the Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin ETFs, new sources of demand to hold bitcoin would open up. In 2004, a new option opened up for investors who did not want to go through the hassle of acquiring and storing physical gold bars. In a similar fashion, in 2024, an option opened up to allow investors to gain exposure to spot bitcoin through familiar brokerage platforms on which they trade ETFs backed by other types of assets. Now, a little more than two months into the journey, we can review how the supply/demand story has been evolving in bitcoin and whether we can clearly see any influence from the ETFs. Figure 2 shows us: It looks like many are interested in bitcoin: One hypothesis advanced before the ETFs launched regarded an increase in investor types-those that were precluded from setting up their own crypto wallets, for example-being able to gain exposure. The daily net flow of BTCs into ETFs is absolutely skewed to the positive end of the spectrum, and we note that there were still many investors working at firms where central home offices have not yet issued blanket approvals to use these products across the board. ETF buying has outpaced bitcoin issuance: Bitcoin purchases by ETFs has outpaced the creation of new bitcoin, over this specific period, by roughly 153,294 units. This may not always be the case, and we note that the overall value of the bitcoin market is over $1 trillion, as we write, but there are large volumes of bitcoin that are proven to not trade with a high frequency. The space is transparent-we can see the ETF buying, we can see the wallets, we can see how long it has been since individual units have moved. The only thing we do not know is exactly when or why owners may trade. Figure 2: ETF Demand vs. Bitcoin Issuance Conclusion: Bitcoin is about Supply and Demand There is no shortage of different models that can create a potential price or range of price levels that might be appropriate for bitcoin. The space is so new, only starting in 2009, that there is not yet a universally accepted valuation methodology-as opposed to, for instance, discounted cash flows for stocks or bonds. While investors continue to search and refine better ways to develop price targets, we find it more informative to consider supply and demand. Right now, it appears that ETF demand is high, and we also know that the halving is coming. Now, ETF demand can change quickly-this is the beauty of the structure-but this will be visible and transparent, and we (as well as others) will be able to monitor these trends in nearly real time. 1 The SPDR Gold Shares Strategy (GLD) launched on 11/18/04.

Important Risks Related to this Article Crypto assets, such as bitcoin and ether, are complex, generally exhibit extreme price volatility and unpredictability, and should be viewed as highly speculative assets. Crypto assets are frequently referred to as crypto ""currencies,"" but they typically operate without central authority or banks, are not backed by any government or issuing entity (i.e., no right of recourse), have no government or insurance protections, are not legal tender and have limited or no usability as compared to fiat currencies. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use, transfer, exchange and value of crypto assets, and regulation in the U.S. and worldwide is still developing. Crypto asset exchanges and/or settlement facilities may stop operating, permanently shut down or experience issues due to security breaches, fraud, insolvency, market manipulation, market surveillance, KYC/AML (know your customer/anti-money laundering) procedures, non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations, technical glitches, hackers, malware or other reasons, which could negatively impact the price of any cryptocurrency traded on such exchanges or reliant on a settlement facility or otherwise may prevent access or use of the crypto asset. Crypto assets can experience unique events, such as forks or airdrops, which can impact the value and functionality of the crypto asset. Crypto asset transactions are generally irreversible, which means that a crypto asset may be unrecoverable in instances where: (i) it is sent to an incorrect address, (ii) the incorrect amount is sent, or (iii) transactions are made fraudulently from an account. A crypto asset may decline in popularity, acceptance or use, thereby impairing its price, and the price of a crypto asset may also be impacted by the transactions of a small number of holders of such crypto asset. Crypto assets may be difficult to value and valuations, even for the same crypto asset, may differ significantly by pricing source or otherwise be suspect due to market fragmentation, illiquidity, volatility and the potential for manipulation. Crypto assets generally rely on blockchain technology and blockchain technology is a relatively new and untested technology which operates as a distributed ledger. Blockchain systems could be subject to internet connectivity disruptions, consensus failures or cybersecurity attacks, and the date or time that you initiate a transaction may be different then when it is recorded on the blockchain. Access to a given blockchain requires an individualized key, which, if compromised, could result in loss due to theft, destruction or inaccessibility. In addition, different crypto assets exhibit different characteristics, use cases and risk profiles.

25217998,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601369,1712239217,Trouble Ahead? Binance Coin Futures Market Under Pressure With Negative Funding Rates,"The outlook for Binance Coin (BNB) has turned cloudy, with both futures market data and technical indicators flashing bearish signals. Based on our analysis of Coinglass data, negative funding rates and declining open interest in BNB futures contracts paint a picture of growing pessimism among traders. Related Reading: XRP Battle Cry: Must Rally 70% To Reconquer $1 Peak After Market Turmoil A negative funding rate suggests that more traders are holding short positions, anticipating a decline in the price of the asset. This sentiment was confirmed on April 1st, when BNB‚Äôs funding rate dipped into negative territory at -0.012%. Binance Coin Funding Rate And Open Interest Down Further fueling the bearish narrative, BNB‚Äôs futures open interest has also witnessed a slight decline of 0.15%. Open interest reflects the total amount of outstanding futures contracts that haven‚Äôt been settled yet. A decrease in open interest suggests traders are exiting their positions without opening new ones, potentially signaling waning confidence in the market. Source: Coinglass Funding rates are a crucial mechanism in perpetual futures contracts that keep the contract price aligned with the spot price. When the contract price trades higher than the spot price, long position holders pay a fee to shorts, resulting in positive funding rates. Conversely, negative funding rates materialize when the contract price dips below the spot price, indicating that short sellers are currently paying fees to longs. Source: Coinglass More Traders Close Their Positions As negative sentiments mount, this open interest is expected to plummet further. This would imply that more traders are closing their positions and not opening new ones, suggesting a potential price drop for BNB. The bearish sentiment isn‚Äôt confined to the futures market.¬†The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), another technical indicator, is suggesting a possible resurgence in selling pressure. There‚Äôs an indication that the MACD line might cross below the signal line, typically interpreted as a bearish sign signaling the return of sellers to the market. It‚Äôs noteworthy that since March 18th, the MACD lines for BNB have been positioned for a downtrend. BNB market cap currently at $87.9 billion. Chart: TradingView.com BNB Price Retreat In The Offing? Considering both the futures market and technical analysis, there‚Äôs a potential for a short-term decline in BNB‚Äôs price. However, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that market sentiment can shift rapidly, and technical indicators aren‚Äôt infallible predictors of future price movements. At the time of writing, BNB was trading at $587, up 6% in the last 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap shows. Related Reading: Fear Grips XRP Market As Liquidations Top $6 Million ‚Äì Details Meanwhile, a closer look at BNB‚Äôs technical indicators on the 24-hour chart reveals another trend. The Directional Movement Index (DMI), used to gauge trend strength, displayed a bearish crossover where the negative directional index sits above the positive directional index. This positioning suggests that bearish momentum is currently dominating the market. Analysts commonly interpret this particular crossover as an imperative signal prompting traders to consider exiting long positions and initiating short positions. This strategic move aligns with the prevailing trend indicated by the DMI, reinforcing the notion of a prevailing bearish sentiment within the market ecosystem.

Going by trends in the crypto market of when the exchange balances of a particular coin goes up, there might be some pain ahead for FTM investors. Fantom Supply On Exchanges Rise By 16 Million The Fantom price had increased over the last month to reach a new three-year high above $1.2. However, this rally was only short-lived and the altcoin has begun to eliminate its gains from the month of March gradually in the past week. Related Reading: Shiba Inu To Rally 100% To $0.000062? Analyst Reveals Why This Is Possible One culprit for this decline in price is the high level of selling that have been taken place among FTM holders, majority of which have been holding their coins for a rather long time. As a result, the available supply of Fantom on centralized exchanges continued to balloon as investors rush to sell off their tokens and capitalize on gains. Data from the on-chain tracking website Santiment shows that in the last week of March, there was a considerable number of FTM flowing into centralized exchanges. This saw their available balance go from around 654 million to over 670 million in the space of a week, with over 16 million flowing into exchanges. This inflow trend coincides with the drop in the Fantom price from above $1.1 to $0.84, suggesting that it is indeed the selling pressure from these FTM investors that is responsible for the price decline. Given this, there would have to be a reversal in this selling trend is the FTM price is to recover from here. Bullishness On FTM Not Dead The inflow of millions of FTM into centralized exchanges is bearish, but this could only last for the short term. As a rule of crypto, eventually, these sellers will run out of coins to sell, leaving room for demand to catch up with the available supply. At this point, the FTM price will begin to see a reversal in the trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Outflows Are Ramping Up Again, What Does This Mean For BTC Price? There is also the fact that adoption has been increasing on the Fantom chain as founder Andre Conje has been actively talking about it on X (formerly Twitter). Santiment‚Äôs data shows that the FTM holder base also grew alongside the price in March. In the week of March 17 and 28 alone, the chain‚Äôs holder BASE jumped from 109,000 to over 111,000. This shows that while the trends are bearish right now, there could be a change soon as the price could resume another leg up. The Fantom price has also established support at $0.8 which could serve as the bounce point for another rally. Presently, the FTM price is sitting at $0.84, with a 5.48% and 18.2% decline on the daily and weekly charts, respectively. Its market cap is at $2.37 billion, making it the 51st largest cryptocurrency in the space.

""The stablecoin market is over $150 billion today and is forecasted to exceed $2.8 trillion by 2028,"" Ripple said in a statement shared with CoinDesk. ""There‚Äôs clear demand for stablecoins that deliver trust, stability and utility.""  The company said the token, which it plans to release ""later this year,"" will be ""100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government Treasuries and other cash equivalents."" The stablecoin will be deployed onto Ripple's institution-focused XRP Ledger along with the Ethereum blockchain to start out, and it will be based on Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard.  Ripple's announcement comes as stablecoins have proven one of the most popular types of digital assets among crypto traders, free (in theory) from the price volatility witnessed in larger cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum's ether (ETH).  Read more: What is a Stablecoin?  ""What we think is going to be our differentiator is going to be the fact that the assets are going to be in dollars, Treasuries ‚Äì rock solid,"" Ripple CTO David Schwartz told CoinDesk in an interview. ""We're not trying to juice the last couple of decimal points out of this. We're looking to conquer the market and be in it for the long term.""  As for why Ripple ‚Äì still battling an enforcement case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ‚Äì has decided to jump into the stablecoin game, Schwartz said that the decision, in part, came down to simple ""dollars and cents.""  ""Part of it is just opportunistic. It's a growing market,"" he said. ""You could be a bank that pays no interest. That seems like a pretty good business opportunity.""  Schwartz said the new stablecoin could also help breathe some life into the XRP Ledger's decentralized finance ecosystem, which has a decentralized exchange but relatively low usage relative to other chains.  According to Schwartz, transparency ‚Äì historically a key point of scrutiny for stablecoin issuers ‚Äì will be a key focus for Ripple as it rolls out its new token.  ""We're gonna have public audits on a monthly basis, hopefully by a top-tier accounting firm and will disclose more on that later,"" said Schwartz. ""We're aiming for complete transparency. You know, we'll do whatever we need to do to address those issues.""  Beyond the promise of transparency, Schwartz emphasized that the potential growth of the stablecoin market ‚Äì currently dominated by Tether's USDT token and Circle's USDC ‚Äì serves as a disincentive for Ripple or any other stablecoin provider to act dishonestly. Coinbase, the publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange, is an investor in Circle.  ""In the early days of Tether, people were expecting it to blow up any day, and they felt like it was really sketchy,"" said Schwartz. But now, ""if you're Tether, it wouldn't make sense for you to run off with people's money,"" said Schwartz. ""Even if that was your plan, you'd wait to do it"" because ""the market is only growing.""  In Ripple's case, ""we're not trying to squeeze a couple of extra pennies out ‚Äì we don't need to,"" said Schwartz. ""Our balance sheet is rock solid.""  The Ripple CTO said his token will be aimed primarily at enterprise customers and banking institutions, organizations for whom ""those kinds of practical arguments aren't really prescient because they have to justify their decisions"" to ""stockholders and to regulators and so on.""  To satisfy the needs of this market segment, Ripple says it is using U.S. banks to hold its reserves and is taking what it terms a ""compliance-first mindset.""  USDC is currently the market leader among compliance-oriented stablecoin consumers, but Schwartz said he doesn't see it as ""a winner takes all"" environment.  ""If we were a solid number three and the market grows 12x, that's not a failure scenario,"" said Schwartz. ""Obviously we would like to do better than that, but that's not a failure case, that's still pretty gosh darn good.""",POSITIVE,USDT | XRP | USDC,MARKET | USDT | WALLET | XRP | USDC,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/04/ripple-developer-behind-xrp-ledger-enters-stablecoin-fray-vs-tether-usdc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc1552192e558bedad67ab6f49fbb51e0a9c6a91-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42408546,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKRET,1712235600,Credbull's First Crypto Fund Chases High Fixed Yields,"Credbull's first private credit fund is targeting returns as high as 30%, much of which is fixed yield.  The product is indicative of a broader maturation in DeFi's lending sector, which has so far been limited to decentralized exchanges and stablecoin applications.  Crypto startup Credbull is soon rolling out an on-chain private credit fund that aims to offer investors exposure to the high-yield lending markets exploding in popularity in traditional finance.  The firm‚Äôs first product recreates private credit's core albeit on crypto rails. Investors buy in using the stablecoin USD Coin (USDC), Credbull converts that USDC to dollars via Circle and then passes that money on to the SME originators, the debt financing companies that make loans to the companies.  ‚ÄúWe all love to chase high yields and love the market fluctuations to a certain degree,"" Credbull's CEO Jason Dehni told CoinDesk in an interview. But ""there's a lack of high fixed yield solutions today.""  The funds' high yield targets are partly a function of its on-chain structure, he explained. Doing everything on a blockchain cuts as much as 150 basis points in fees that would otherwise go to administrative costs. In private credit, small- and mid-sized businesses in need of financing get their money from specialized lenders instead of banks. These deals have grown into a $1.7 trillion market, according to Bloomberg, that rivals the banks and caters to tony investor types who are willing to lock their money for years in exchange for strong returns.  Such deals aren't unheard of in crypto but they take a definite backseat to the much riskier gambler's menu of sky high farming plays. Most of the stable upside in real world assets (RWA) are tied to tokenized treasuries, or digital representations of U.S. government bonds that can be traded as tokens on the blockchain. Lending pools, which cater mostly to traders, offer variable rate products unacceptable to more serious investors.  There's more than a little crypto twist to Credbull  For starters, its ""community"" (the investors) will have a say in governing the fund's risk profile and transparency into how it handles their money. Established private credit markets are missing both, Dehni said.  The fund itself also has a six- to 12-month lockup ‚Äì a far shorter timetable than investors in traditional private credit are used to, he said. It will pay fixed yields as high as 10% for longer-term investors, plus 10 to 20% of the upside generated by the fund.  ""We're not targeting family offices,"" Dehni, a banking journeyman said. ""We don't want to lock folks more than 12 months simply because the nature of DeFi investors is very different.""  Despite those differences, Credbull's entrance is indicative of a broader professionalization of crypto's credit markets. The company behind lending protocol Goldfinch recently launched an SEC-registered investment advisory that routes private credit deals through its on-chain portal.  Credbull's fund is registered in the Bahamas. It's the first licensed on-chain private credit fund, Dehni claims, and could start chugging in May. He's in active discussions with crypto finance platforms that are considering plugging into Credbull.  ""If we are looking to mature as an industry and broaden the reach we have to start thinking about a more diversified high fixed yield,"" Dehni said.",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/04/credbulls-first-crypto-fund-chases-high-fixed-yields,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5afefa3d04c379355ff916ff255b3bd55be7fd6-5028x2828.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The commission had been pressured into abandoning its opposition to the bitcoin applications after a key loss in a court dispute with Grayscale, and SEC officials said the resulting approval of bitcoin ETFs doesn't apply to other tokens.  Investment firm VanEck predicts Ethereum layer-2 (L2) networks could be valued at over $1 trillion by 2030 in a base-case scenario but remains ‚Äúgenerally bearish‚Äù on the long-term prospects of several such networks. The firm evaluated 46 L2 networks across five key areas and predicted ‚Äúthousands‚Äù of rollups will eventually emerge. Arbitrum is currently the biggest ecosystem, with over $18 billion in locked tokens, data shows, capturing the majority of $36 billion locked across 46 networks. VanEck analysts Patrick Bush and Matthew Sigel estimated that Ethereum will eventually capture 60% of the market share across all public blockchains. They modeled their estimate around the volume of assets within the Ethereum ecosystem.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows annualized funding rates, or costs of holding long/short positions in perpetual futures, tied to the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market value.  The recent bitcoin price pullback has normalized funding rates to between 10% and 20%.  Rates spiked to 100% and above last month, signaling a build-up of excess bullish leverage.

This move captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, just days after the transfer of approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin related to the infamous Silk Road marketplace. Arkham Intel, utilizing its advanced tracking technology, noted that just two hours ago, the US government executed multiple transactions involving the seized digital assets. These included the transfer of 0.69 BTC, worth approximately $45.750, and another 374 BTC, valued at around $24.80 million, to a newly identified Bitcoin address (3GoRwyQvAJhX3conyuq355JiBD9FyfXAQe). Additionally, 218.5 BTC, worth $14.49 million, were also moved to the same address, along with 4.567K ETH, equating to $15.21 million. Just minutes prior to press time, another 0.0001 BTC and 0.5 BTC were moved to another new address (3LNW8R3AfDQgVCB9sQPwChyG47ktSjh3f3). Both the Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses are new and previously unknown to Arkham, suggesting a strategic consolidation rather than an immediate liquidation of assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck Below $66,000: Are ETF Outflows Beyond Grayscale An Issue? The seized funds originate from Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Tur√µgin, two Estonians arrested in their home country in October 2022 following an 18-count indictment by a grand jury in the Western District of Washington. The duo was implicated in orchestrating a $575 million cryptocurrency fraud through their ventures, HashFlare, a cryptocurrency mining service, and Polybius Bank, a virtual currency bank that never existed nor returned promised dividends to investors. Their elaborate scheme not only involved fraudulent equipment rental contracts but also utilized shell companies for laundering the proceeds to acquire luxury real estate and vehicles. In September last year, the Estonian government approved the extradition of Potapenko and Tur√µgin to the United States. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas revealed at that time that the decision had been made at the government level. Today‚Äôs transactions by the US government follow a precedent set by the movement of Silk Road‚Äôs bitcoins. Notably, 2,000 BTC from the Silk Road haul were transferred to a Coinbase wallet, while the remainder were relocated to a wallet identified by Arkham as belonging to the government.

This pattern indicates a systematic approach by the US government to handling seized digital assets, focusing on consolidation before any potential future actions. As the crypto market observed these developments, the price of Bitcoin has remained stable, hovering above $66,000. The significant amount of funds involved and the government‚Äôs handling of such assets continue to be a point of interest for both investors and observers within the crypto space. Contrary to common belief, it‚Äôs important to note that the US govt normally doesn‚Äôt sell Bitcoin or Ether at the open market. ‚ÄúThe Silk Road US GOV coins FUD is literally just FUD.

The executives were due to be arraigned Thursday.  A Federal High Court in Abuja, Nigeria's capital, has adjourned hearings for the local tax authority's cases against crypto exchange Binance Holdings and two of its executives who were detained by government authorities, local news outlets reported on Thursday.  The matter was adjourned due to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) not being able to serve Binance's Head of Financial Crime Compliance Tigran Gambaryan the charges while he was in custody, the Punch reported. While Gambaryan was detained along with another Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, in February, the latter has since escaped custody. Gambaryan reportedly appeared in court Thursday.  The Binance Holdings hearing has been adjourned till April 8, and the case against Gambaryan and Anjarwalla has been adjourned until April 19, Bloomberg reported.  The FIRS filed tax evasion charges against Binance in March. The four counts of tax evasion included ""non-payment of Value-Added Tax (VAT), Company Income Tax, failure to tax returns, and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through its platform.""  A month prior to the FIRS' suit, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were detained by authorities in the country. At the time, Nigeria accused the crypto exchange of operating illegally and manipulating its economy.  Gambaryan will remain in the custody of Nigeria‚Äôs Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Bloomberg said in its report.  Binance said in a blog post that Gambaryan has no decision-making power in Nigeria and should be left out of discussions on Wednesday. Gambaryan's wife started a petition on March 30 to bring him home.  CoinDesk has reached out to Binance for a comment.

Can bitcoin's climb continue? How bitcoin's rise is impacting interest in cryptocurrency ETFs. An uptick of inflows into U.S.-listed cryptocurrency ETFs is helping to push the price of bitcoin higher. Andres Rincon, Managing Director and Head of ETF Sales and Strategy at TD Securities, discusses the state of the crypto ETF market and potential opportunities and risks for investors. Transcript Greg Bonnell - A lot of excitement in the markets around the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States. But how is the space evolving since the launch in January? Joining us now to discuss that and some other things, Andres Rincon, Managing Director and Head of ETF Sales and Strategy at TD Securities. Andres, it's great to have you back on the program. Andres Rincon - Thank you for having me. Greg Bonnell - All right, so when we launched in January -- I should say, they launched their spot Bitcoin ETFs south of the border in January -- we had you on for that initial reaction explanation of the space. We've got a few months under our belt. How is the space evolving? Andres Rincon - It's been really, really fascinating. So as we talked about at the time, there's been 11 -- at the start, 11 Bitcoin ETFs that were approved and were launched in the US. And it's been a lot of activity. We've seen a lot of excitement, a lot of news. It's been on the news consistently in the US. Really, what we're seeing is new money coming into the space, which is very interesting. We've seen some money flow from existing crypto products that weren't already in the space into the ETF structure, but we've also seen a lot of new money coming to the space. And that's what's really, in my opinion, exciting. Now that you have behemoths like BlackRock and Fidelity putting their name behind the crypto ETF, you also have a lot of advisors now and other investors saying, OK, well, maybe this is a little bit more legitimate, and maybe I should allocate a little bit into these funds. And the evolution really has been that now we're seeing advisors and investors put a small allocation into their traditional portfolio. So let's say 3% or 5%, or what perhaps was your gold exposure before now is your crypto exposure. So we're seeing a little bit more of this transition. And what's really interesting is that this was expected but really unintended. What I mean by that is that the SEC was basically forced to approve many of these ETFs. Greg Bonnell - That was the big caveat, right? They weren't saying, we endorse these investing products. They simply said, there was a decision, and here we are. Andres Rincon - That's right. So Gary Gensler was very clear. There's a lot of risks. He doesn't necessarily endorse these. But here you are, basically. So now you have all these ETFs with big names behind them, so they're trading a lot more. Since then, we've also seen a lot of different filings for other types of crypto ETFs. Greg Bonnell - Because Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency in the world. Andres Rincon - That's right. You have ether ETFs. And what's really fascinating is that, just as a quick reminder, we have crypto ETFs here in Canada. We have both Bitcoin ETFs and ether ETFs, which the US does not have today. We do suspect that the United States will get ether ETFs in the not-too-distant future. I think the SEC will take its time on that one. But given what we've seen in Europe, for example, we do suspect that we're going to see ether and other cryptocurrencies eventually come on board. The reason we haven't seen that in Canada past ether is because one of the restrictions is being that you need to be able to trade futures in the actual cryptocurrency to list an ETF, and those restrictions are not necessarily there in the US. So I suspect there's going to be a lot more of that in the US. So right now, we're going to next get ether and perhaps other things in the US. Greg Bonnell - So clearly you've seen the interest in the space. Remind us of the risks around some of these products when people don't truly understand what the product is. Andres Rincon - Well there -- and I'm speaking on behalf of the SEC, the SEC has already talked quite a bit about some of the risks. So if you look at what they've pointed to, a couple of the risks is that there's a lot of manipulation in the cryptocurrency itself. And most importantly, the SEC cannot control that market. It's not a regulated market. And because they can't regulate it, they feel uncomfortable as to what happens in those markets, to some respect. They see there's a lot of flow and money going into that space that they can't regulate, either, from a money laundering point of view. So there is a lot of conversations there. But there's also the concern of custody at the end of the day. These are digital assets. And although the custodian for all these ETFs is heavily regulated, they're still digital. And it's a new -- I'll call it process, compared to the traditional custody model. So there are many risks to these ETFs. And obviously, there's a lot of volatility in cryptocurrency, so there's obviously the risk of loss for many of these ETFs. Greg Bonnell - Definitely an interesting space. So crypto, a good run this year. It's been a bit shaky, but it's sort of been rising again. How about some other commodities you're seeing in the markets, like the commodities ETFs? What's the market like there for that? Andres Rincon - So similar to crypto, that's done really, really well from a performance point of view. So Bitcoin, as we've seen, has done really well. Other areas have done very well is commodities. So you've seen the price of gold continues to skyrocket. Oil continues to skyrocket. And what's really interesting is that commodities have been really, really resilient during times of distress. So if you look at COVID, you look at the Ukraine-Russia conflict, the current conflict in Iran, in the waters, so a lot of that is actually pushing these commodities higher, and not just these two, gold and oil, but also across the board. Despite that, though, the allocation to commodities is relatively low these days. So if you look at flows in commodity ETFs in the US and Canada last year, it was fairly muted, to be honest. This year it's slightly up, but last year, actually, in Canada, it was slightly down. And it's interesting to see how these assets have done so well, but the allocations have been fairly muted. And given they are resilient and they do diversify a portfolio, it's one area that's often overlooked. And you have gold ETFs. You have oil ETFs. You have base metal ETFs. You have agricultural ETFs. You have many different areas they can invest here, in both Canada and the US. Greg Bonnell - Let's talk about covered call ETFs. We've discussed it before on your previous appearances here. What's the space looking like right now? Still remaining popular? Andres Rincon - Let me put it this way. Canada -- this has been one of the areas that Canada has really thrived in. We have over 160 covered call ETFs just here in Canada. And the space is fairly large, over $20 billion. I think it's $24 billion right now. And why is that? Because we have investors that really need and want yield. Now in the US, although they launched the first covered call ETFs in the world, PVP by Invesco, it didn't really catch on for many years. But it wasn't until 2020 when J.P. Morgan launched JEPI and JEPQ that it really started to catch on and grow. But that industry has gone like this the entire time. It's gone considerably higher. We've seen a lot of money piling into the space. They have only fewer products. They have, I think, 38 products. But they're now at $60 billion, all of a sudden. We blinked, and it was $60 billion. JEPI alone, one of the products from J.P. Morgan, is $33 billion. So if you include J.P. Morgan and Global X, these two issuers, they dominate the space, about 85% of the AUM in that space. It's really, really interesting. The products are slightly different. They're more broad market-focused in the US. In Canada, they're sector-based and broad market, so they're a little bit -- given we have so much more product, we have more breadth here. But the popularity in the US has gone very, very high, very incremental. Now every single issuer, every week or so, is launching a new covered call ETFs because they're seeing the benefits of those products in the US. Greg Bonnell - What do investors need to be aware of in this? I mean, the idea of a covered call, from what I understand, is to generate some income. But maybe you don't take part in all of the upside. Andres Rincon - That's right. So basically, when you're investing in a yield-enhanced or covered call ETF, you're making an active decision to give away some of your growth in exchange for income today. So you're saying, I prefer, in this environment or in the current environment that I am as an investor, I prefer to get income today versus the growth that I might get in the future and the benefits of that. And to many retirees, this is exactly what they want. So it also depends on what part of your life cycle you're in, right? So it's not for everybody. It's for the right people that want income, and that's what these products offer. Greg Bonnell - Important to make those decisions and considerations. We've got a bit of an anniversary in the ETF space as well. It's been 34 years since something happened. Andres Rincon - Yes. A lot of people don't know this, actually, but the first ETF ever launched here in Canada. It was a very tight competition between what we call the TIPs, which tracked the TSX 35 index. And that was the first ETF ever launched in the world. Shortly after, SPY, which is the world's largest ETF, launched. But Canada actually launched the first ETF. And in March, it was the 34th anniversary of ETFs. And also, we had a couple of very good milestones. We have 40 issuers now, 1,400 products in Canada, and over $400 billion in assets under management in the ETF industry. So we also hit a couple of milestones in February and March for the ETF industry in Canada.

This, despite a broader cryptocurrency bull run that began roughly six months ago. While some analysts predict a swift surge to bridge the gap, others remain cautious due to ongoing legal battles and a volatile market. Related Reading: Fear Grips XRP Market As Liquidations Top $6 Million ‚Äì Details Currently, XRP hovers around $0.59, a significant distance from the $1 many investors had hoped for. The token has experienced significant volatility in recent months, oscillating between $0.50 and $0.65. A brief rally to $0.75 in March offered a glimmer of hope, but it was quickly followed by a retreat. XRP: Several Obstacles To Overcome This underwhelming performance can be attributed to several factors. The ongoing lawsuit between Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to cast a shadow over the token‚Äôs future. The SEC alleges that XRP is an unregistered security, a claim Ripple vehemently denies. The uncertainty surrounding the lawsuit has undoubtedly dampened investor sentiment. Further complicating matters is the prevailing bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency, has experienced a significant correction in recent weeks, dragging down the entire market with it. This broader market trend has limited XRP‚Äôs potential for independent growth. XRP market cap currently at $31.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Positive Vibe Lingers However, a wave of optimism persists among some XRP proponents. They point to the token‚Äôs underlying utility on RippleNet, a network designed to facilitate faster and cheaper international payments. RippleNet boasts a growing list of institutional partners, including major banks and financial institutions. This adoption, they argue, positions XRP for significant growth once the legal issues are resolved and the market stabilizes. Adding fuel to this optimism are analysts who foresee a dramatic price increase for XRP in the near future. Some, like analyst Tylie Eric, have boldly predicted a 60% surge within a short timeframe, citing parallels to the explosive bull run of late 2017. #XRP.

Related Reading: Shiba Inu Fires Up With 4,000% Burn ‚Äì Price Rebound Coming? The future trajectory of XRP remains uncertain.

42408571,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKeBw,1712221058,"Hedge Funds Hold Record Bearish Bitcoin Bets, Data Show","Leveraged funds held record net short positions in CME's bitcoin futures last week, CFTC data show.  Most funds may have taken short positions as a part of a ""carry trade,"" one observer said.  Some funds may be preparing for a post-halving price drop.  Leveraged funds, which the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) describes as hedge funds and commodity trading advisers, held record bearish wagers on the bitcoin {{BTC}} price at the end of the first quarter as the cryptocurrency's rally stalled near record highs.  Hedge funds boosted their net short positions in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) standard bitcoin futures contracts to 16,102. That's the most since the futures began trading in late 2017, according to CFTC figures published last week. CME's standard bitcoin futures contracts are sized at 5 BTC.  A short futures position is a trading strategy in which a trader sells a futures contract to profit from or hedge against an expected drop in the underlying asset's price. Carry traders or arbitrageurs short futures while simultaneously buying the asset to safely pocket the price differential between the spot and futures market.  The record buildup in short positions likely reflects hedge funds' renewed interest in the carry trade, according to Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research.  ""There is a massive demand from hedge funds to put on carry trades. Despite bitcoin‚Äôs -10% decline from the all-time high, the futures premium has remained in double digits, and hedge funds are taking advantage of these high rates,"" Thielen told CoinDesk in an interview.  While bitcoin's bullish momentum stalled after hitting record highs above $73,500 in March, CME futures continue to trade at an annualized three-month premium of over 10%, according to Velo Data. In other words, carry trades still yield at least twice as much as the 10-year Treasury note, which offered a so-called risk-free return of 4.36% at press time.  That said, some hedge funds may have taken outright bearish bets as recent robust U.S. economic data and hawkish comments from the Fed officials weakened the case for rapid-fire interest-rate cuts in the near term.  On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized the need to see how inflation evolves in the coming months, keeping the timing of the first-rate cut uncertain. Since the release of upbeat manufacturing data on Monday, the probability of the Fed cutting rates in June has dropped below 50%.  In addition, some observers are skeptical that the impending mining reward halving will live up to its bullish reputation.  The Bitcoin blockchain's fourth mining reward halving, due later this month, reduces the per-block amount of BTC issued as a reward to miners to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. Historically, bitcoin has chalked out major bull runs 12 to 18 months after halving, when the reduced per-block emission met demand.  If past data is a guide, the path of least resistance is higher. However, according to David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, the small sample size makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions in a market fundamentally altered by the January debut of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.  ""We believe that bitcoin‚Äôs market dynamics have fundamentally changed with the advent of U.S. spot BTC ETFs,"" Duong said in a market update last month. ""Their multi-billion dollar net inflows in just two months have irrevocably altered the landscape. With major institutional players now capable of taking exposure through these vehicles, bitcoin's response to the upcoming halving may not necessarily mirror its performance in prior cycles.""  ""We think studies of previous cycles should be interpreted cautiously, as the small sample size makes it difficult to generalize patterns here,"" he said.  The launch of spot ETFs brought lifted bitcoin to record highs ahead of the halving, as opposed to previous cycles. That has left the door open for a post-halving price drop.  Analysts at JPMorgan foresee bitcoin falling to $42,000 after the halving hype subsides. At press time, bitcoin changed hands near $66,000.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/04/hedge-funds-hold-record-bearish-bitcoin-bets-data-show,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7fda8a1a82f4f8f8ac82a6b81947cb46189e5edf-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm evaluated 46 layer 2 networks across five key areas and predicted ‚Äúthousands‚Äù of rollups to eventually emerge. Arbitrum is the most extensive ecosystem, with over $18 billion in locked tokens.  VanEck said that transaction pricing, developer experience, user experience, trust assumptions, and ecosystem size, could play into the layer 2 networks' growth.  Investment firm VanEck predicts Ethereum layer 2 (L2) networks could be valued at over $1 trillion by 2030 in a base case scenario but remains ‚Äúgenerally bearish‚Äù on the long-term prospects of several such networks.  The firm evaluated 46 L2 networks across five key areas and predicted ‚Äúthousands‚Äù of rollups to eventually emerge. Arbitrum is currently the biggest ecosystem with over $18 billion in locked tokens, data shows, capturing the majority of $36 billion locked across 46 networks.  VanEck analysts Patrick Bush and Matthew Sigel estimate that Ethereum will eventually capture 60% of the market share across all public blockchains. They modeled their estimate around the volume of assets within the Ethereum ecosystem.  L2s are secondary networks or infrastructure built atop a main blockchain, such as Ethereum, to help with scalability and speed. Rollups are a certain type of scaling system.  VanEck said the following factors would eventually come into play for the long-term growth of L2 networks.  Transaction Pricing: The cost to users for transacting on L2 networks is a critical factor for attracting users. Differentiation in transaction pricing stems from factors such as data compression, scale, proving costs, and profit margins.  Developer Experience: Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility is paramount for L2 networks to attract developers, ensuring seamless porting of smart contracts and tooling from Ethereum.  User Experience: The speed of onboarding assets and withdrawal processes ultimately shapes the user experience.  Trust Assumptions: Building trust around data availability on an L2 and steps in place to prevent exploits and hacks.  Ecosystem Size: The strength of an L2 network‚Äôs ecosystem significantly influences its value. Value locked on an L2 indicates engagement as it indicates money put into the ecosystem to capture opportunities.  Risks remain  Meanwhile, Busk and Siegel wrote that the firm expects there to be cut-throat competition amongst L2s, stating they were generally bearish on the sector‚Äôs outperformance.  ‚ÄúWe are generally bearish on the long-term value prospects for the majority of L2 tokens,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúThe top 7 tokens for L2 collectively already have $40 billion of FDV, and there are many strong projects that intend to launch over the medium term.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis means there is potentially $100 billion more in FDV in L2 tokens coming to market over the next 12-18 months.

25206218,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601345,1712216746,"Bitcoin Stuck Below $66,000: Are ETF Outflows Beyond Grayscale An Issue?","On Tuesday, the crypto market was off guard when Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARK 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) experienced a significant outflow. This marked the first time since the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States that one of the ‚ÄúNewborn Nine‚Äù surpassed the outflows of Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). On April 2, ARKB saw outflows of $87.5 million, approximately 1,300 BTC, as reported by Farside Investors, while Grayscale recorded a daily outflow of $81.9 million. This event marked a notable shift in the Bitcoin market dynamics, raising concerns and debates among investors and analysts alike. The core question that arises is whether such outflows indicate a bearish signal for Bitcoin‚Äôs price or if they are a natural part of the market‚Äôs ebb and flow. Are ETF Outflows Beyond Grayscale Concerning? Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, offered an analytical perspective on the event, advocating for a broader view of ETF dynamics. In a series of comments on social media platform X, Balchunas downplayed the severity of the outflows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders No Longer Extremely Greedy: Rebound Signal? ‚ÄúSeeing some of CT up in arms over ARKB having an outflow day, which really shows the greedy and short-sighted nature of some of the folks in this space tbh,‚Äù he remarked, suggesting that even the most reputable ETFs, like those offered by Vanguard, periodically experience outflows as part of their operational cycle. Balchunas further elaborated on the significance of ARKB‚Äôs performance, stating, ‚ÄúARKB has $2.8b in under 3 months on the market. And it‚Äôs only the 3rd biggest. I would have guessed 3rd place would be $500m at this point. The inflows have been that epic, and without the ETFs, btc is probably at like $30k.‚Äù This comment highlights the instrumental role of ETFs in bolstering Bitcoin‚Äôs market price, suggesting that the recent outflows, while notable, represent a minor setback in the grand scheme. The analyst also addressed the collective behavior of ETF investors, emphasizing that the recent downturn in Bitcoin‚Äôs price should not solely be attributed to ETF outflows. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòten‚Äô are a team, and yesterday they saw net inflows as a team, yet btc went down like 6% = the selling (as usual) is coming from your fellow supposed hodlers,‚Äù he pointed out, hinting at the broader market dynamics and investor behaviors influencing price movements. Related Reading: Asia‚Äôs Bitcoin Volatility Linked To Algos Tracking ETF Flows Renowned crypto expert Scott Melker weighed in on the debate, suggesting a possible rationale behind the ARKB outflows. ‚ÄúProbably just a large investor allocating to a different ETF,‚Äù Melker commented, indicating the strategic reallocation of assets within the crypto ETF space. Responding to inquiries about the transparency of ETF transactions, Balchunas highlighted the inherent anonymity of ETF trading, stating, ‚ÄúNo way to know, could be someone spooked by volatility, could have been ARK itself taking profits [‚Ä¶] Not even the issuer knows who is going in and out of their ETFs. That anonymity is an underrated feature of ETFs,‚Äù thereby shedding light on the privacy aspects that differentiate ETFs from other investment vehicles. Bitcoin Inflows Are Positive Again Despite the concerns raised by the recent outflows, the ETF market demonstrated resilience yet again with positive flows of $113.5 million yesterday.

This figure far surpassed the returns of other narratives, highlighting the growing popularity and frenzy surrounding memecoins in the cryptocurrency market. RWA Vs Memecoins Three newly launched tokens were among the top 10 memecoins by market cap at the end of the quarter: Brett (BRETT), BOOK OF MEME (BOME) and Cat in a dogs world (MEW). BRETT generated the highest returns since its launch with a gain of 7727.6%, closely followed by dogwifhat (WIF) with a gain of 2721.2% during the quarter.¬†Notably, the memecoin narrative outperformed other crypto narratives by a significant margin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders No Longer Extremely Greedy: Rebound Signal? Compared to the second most profitable narrative, RWA, memecoins were 4.6 times more profitable, and their returns were 33.3 times higher than those of the Layer 2 narrative, which experienced the lowest gains in Q1. The RWA narrative, which stands for ‚ÄúReal-World Assets‚Äú, returned 285.6% in Q1. Although it briefly held the title of the most profitable narrative in early February, memecoins and artificial intelligence-based (AI) tokens outperformed RWA in terms of returns. However, RWA managed to regain its position ahead of the AI narrative by the end of March. Notable winners in the RWA category included MANTRA (OM) and TokenFi (TOKEN), which posted quarter-to-date (QTD) returns of 1074.4% and 419.7% respectively. XDC Network (XDC) was the only RWA token to decline, falling 15.6% for the quarter. Artificial intelligence closely followed RWA as the only other narrative to deliver three-digit returns, reaching 222.0% in Q1. All large-cap AI tokens experienced gains, with AIOZ Network (AIOZ) leading the pack at 480.2% and Fetch.ai (FET) following closely at 378.3%. Even the lowest gainer in the AI category, OriginTrail (TRAC), returned a respectable 74.9% during the quarter, indicating the overall interest in AI-related tokens. Layer 1 Tokens Trail Behind The decentralized finance (DeFi) narrative delivered moderate returns of 98.9% in the first quarter. In late February, DeFi returns were boosted by the Uniswap (UNI) fee switch proposal. DeFi tokens that performed well included Jupiter (JUP) with gains of 125.7%, Maker (MKR) with 121.2%, and The Graph (GRT) with 111.0% QTD. In contrast, the Layer 1 (L1) narrative delivered relatively lower profitability with 70.0% returns in Q1 2024. While Solana (SOL) garnered attention as a popular memecoin chain, the top-performing large L1 cryptocurrencies were Toncoin (TON) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) with gains of 131.2% and 130.5%, respectively. Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a 65.1% gain, reaching new all-time highs, while Ethereum (ETH) posted a more modest 53.9% increase, despite the anticipation surrounding US spot Ethereum ETF applications.
