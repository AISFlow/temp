42403357,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfnwP,1570748423,'Teenage Bitcoin Millionaire' Co-Founds $1 Million Investment Fund for Crypto Startups,"The leaders of crypto payment app Metal Pay, Marshall Hayner and Erik Finman, are launching an investment fund.  Dubbed Metal VC, the $1 million dollar fund will focus on micro and angel investments, primarily in early-stage companies involved in banking and decentralized finance. The fund will allow the startup to align with partners as it expands globally, according to Metal CEO Hayner.  The Metal subsidiary closed its first deal last month, with an undisclosed stake in the Binance-backed startup Yellow Card, which provides a cash-to-crypto on-ramp for emerging markets.  A week after the deal, Finman told CoinDesk he may be close to closing on another startup. This time, an app created by a YouTuber to compete against the video hosting giant that features an in-app currency that could be converted into crypto.  “With Metal VC, our vision is simple, if we see something we like and believe in, we will invest and send MTL Coin right then and there,” Hayner said, adding:  ""We view each investment as a partner to Metal.""  Though the amount of time spent advising each firm will vary, Metal is willing to contribute resources including developers or admins depending on a startup's needs, according to Finman.  The fund is looking to invest seed funding in anywhere between 25 to 100 startups at various stages of development. With an eye towards leading the round “when we can,” Finman said. Metal VC will stake anywhere between a minimum of $25,000 and a maximum of $250,000 in each project.  The fund is self-funded by Finman and Hayner, without outside contributions.  As “the VC fund for misfits,” Finman said he and Hayner are considering company metrics that traditional investment funds may ignore, such as an engaged Discord channel. A founder’s personal quirks also play to Finman’s ear, citing the “super young” and ambitious, or leaders of hacking collectives. Said Finman:  “The more of a misfit, the better job you can have in pitching me.""

42403344,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfnoX,1570736036,"Devcon Shows Ethereum's 'World Computer' Is a Movement, Not a Product","If there’s anywhere in the world where it feels right to believe in magic, it’s Devcon 5 in Osaka, Japan.  The ethereum community faces a daunting task: scale its blockchain ecosystem to securely support the growing demand for mainstream use cases. Thousands of technologists and passionate fans gathered at Devcon this week to grapple with the nitty-gritty, in a venue marked by rainbow signage. Among them sat 16-year-old Shawki Sukkar, a self-taught developer from Aleppo, Syria.  “I’m searching wherever I find an opportunity to learn,” Sukkar, one of the 50 scholarship attendees at Devcon, told CoinDesk. “People look smart here. They have a great mindset.”  Since his father’s factory was destroyed in the Syrian civil war, and his friend’s identity documents were lost as well, the unbanked Sukkar has taken a keen interest in ethereum-based identity solutions and financial products.  Beyond Sukkar, several attendees told CoinDesk they came to this developers conference, and other smaller ethereum-centric events worldwide, to learn by contributing.  Along those lines, Mariano Conti, the MakerDAO Foundation's head of smart contracts, gave a presentation about how he lives in Argentina earning only a cryptocurrency salary. He openly acknowledged the risks of relying on an open-source experiment instead of his national currency deposited in a regulated bank. However, Conti said he trusts the ethereum community more than the Argentine government.  Conti’s statement garnered resounding applause from the audience, including several people who also use cryptocurrency as a survival tool. This type of testing ground, with participants who give feedback directly to technologists at Devcon, is a boon for the network.  Beyond that, however, the event is a key venue for determining the network’s priorities for the year ahead.  “Lots of narratives make a lot of sense,” ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin told CoinDesk when asked to define ethereum, adding:  “The ‘world computer’ narrative is a useful and good one. It’s called the ethereum ecosystem, or the decentralized protocol ecosystem, of which ethereum will be a central component.”  The plan  Devcon is an anomaly among cryptocurrency conferences in that the content is both highly technical and deliberately accessible.  Panels and workshops, about issues like scaling decentralized applications, revolve around opportunities for questions from community members of all skill levels. Sometimes engineers raise issues they’ve dealt with in serving clients, other times users ask about price mechanisms. There are even several panels and speaking slots reserved for ethereum rivals, like OpenLibra or ethereum classic.  So far, there aren’t any finite plans to address the scaling limitations of the current ethereum ecosystem with the blockchain’s upcoming iteration, Eth 2. However, there are several proposals in-process and thousands of people more invested in testing these theories than they are in profiting from them.  “The scope of who has been involved is an iterative process,” Ethereum Foundation developer Danny Ryan, part of the team leading research for Eth 2, told CoinDesk. “And we fully expect that to keep expanding [the process] all the way out to dapp users.”  He said community members can contribute comments and requests to the process via GitHub and Ethresear.ch, adding there will definitely be a more concrete plan for compatibility between ethereum and Eth 2 in 2020.  Speaking of how the MakerDAO ecosystem will adapt to the evolution of Eth 2, which may not provide backwards compatibility, Ethereum Foundation community manager Hudson Jameson told CoinDesk:  “We’re going to work very closely with dapps, big and small, to make sure data, such as MakerDAO’s loan contracts, can be utilized or transitioned in Eth 2.0.""  In the meantime, Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki, currently incubated under the ConsenSys umbrella, is looking to increase funding for open-source developers beyond philanthropy from original ethereum co-founders.  Since the Gitcoin fund distribution platform launched in January 2019, Owocki told CoinDesk it has grown to process $200,000 of cryptocurrency donations a month.  “I’d love to work for the internet. I’d love for software developers not have to work at a corporate job that has a monopoly on their employment,” Owocki said, adding:  “I think there’s a lot of opportunity in this community to create systems that will scale … for sovereignty of employment.”  Definitions in progress  Outside critics harp on the vague use of language when it comes to defining goals and objectives for ethereum development.  But, like most ethereum fans at Devcon, Owocki isn’t bothered by the experimental nature of ethereum infrastructure development, which is arguably less rigorous and conservative than traditional open-source projects.  “I think it’s more honest not to have deadlines when you have something fundamentally new and you need to do research,” he said.  ConsenSys security engineer Shayan Eskandari, a bitcoiner since 2011 who helped create some of Iran’s leading educational resources for crypto users, said ethereum and bitcoin have inherently different philosophies.  “It’s like comparing gold with ice cream. Ethereum is a playground where you can do almost anything you want, although everything [in the protocols] will change,” he said, adding:  “Ethereum isn’t about trying to build censorship-resistant [money]. It’s about a more open system.”  Ethereum’s figureheads seem to share that view. Beyond funding early experiments with grants, Lubin said the 1,000-person ConsenSys is hiring again, after a round of layoffs late last year.  “We’ve built the early stages of the decentralized World Wide Web, the strongest candidate to be the base trust layer for the planet,” he said. “We have quite concrete plans, but I can only say things in vague terms.”  Sources with knowledge of the matter told CoinDesk that ConsenSys is working on pilot projects with financial institutions such as banks and government entities, which Lubin confirmed but declined to specify.  When asked what he expects the ethereum community, including his company, to accomplish by Devcon 2020, he replied, “more good stuff.”  Joseph Lubin speaks at Devcon 5, Osaka, Japan, October 2019, image via ConsenSys",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | FIAT | MKR | RESEARCH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/10/devcon-shows-ethereums-world-computer-is-a-movement-not-a-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/534a22ef7f01f98bab05983b69800f8f119b170c-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403333,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfmF8,1570728654,CoinDesk's Most Influential 2019: Vote Now for Crypto's Heroes (and Villains),"This has been another tumultuous year for the blockchain industry, rife with tragedy and comedy, mystery and strife, innovation and disappointment.  Just consider some of 2019's biggest stories: QuadrigaCX's CEO took hundreds of millions in customer funds to the grave. Craig Wright threatened legal action against a cartoon cat. Coinbase hired (then fired) a team of mercenary hackers. Kik fought the SEC. Justin Sun paid handsomely to dine with Warren Buffett (and mysteriously postponed at the last minute). Bakkt overcame regulatory roadblocks to launch a watershed bitcoin derivative product (albeit with inauspicious early results).  Then there was Libra – perhaps the biggest story of all. This was the year the financial establishment finally had to contend with the full implications of digital money for the first time.  Through it all, the blockchain industry continued to morph and grow. We’ve seen the rise of DeFi and interest-bearing instruments from the likes of MakerDAO and Compound. We’ve seen bitcoin return to its perch as easily the most important crypto project (both by market cap and developer activity). We’ve seen a string of new stablecoins, and several national digital currency projects, from China to the Marshall Islands.  Each year, CoinDesk publishes its ""Most Influential in Blockchain"" series to highlight people who’ve stood out in the space and made significant contributions (here's the 2018 list). The 10 names are selected both by readers (including you, hopefully) and by reporters and editors here. It’s a chance to take stock and look back, to celebrate the variety of people in this space, and have a bit of fun. As well as exceptional entrepreneurs and developers, we also recognize significant thinkers, communicators and regulators, and even the odd oddball.  We need your vote  Take a look at the long-list here, selected by CoinDesk editors and reporters. We need your help narrowing down this group to a final 15 (a top-10 with a few runners-up).  Who jumps out to you as particularly noteworthy in 2019? Who had a big year? Who was at the top of their game? Who pushed technology in a new direction, or explained or defined topics in a unique way? Nominate FIVE people you feel made the greatest impact. Then, for Question 2, name anyone you think we've forgotten and should include.  This year, we’ve also made space for the “villains” of crypto – people who are more notorious than award-worthy (we all have our favorites). Some might argue that heretics and blowhards don’t deserve more of our time, but we want to take in the full scope of blockchain humanity. For Question 3, please nominate TWO people who made a splash in 2019 for less-than-honorable reasons.  Again, the survey is here. Thanks for your time and for your consideration (we promise it won't take long to fill in).

The NYAG's office asked New York Supreme Court Justice Joel Cohen to order Bitfinex, Tether, and a number of other affiliated entities to compile all documentation about the loan earlier this month during an ongoing appeals process. Bitfinex opposed this request in another letter sent to the judge earlier this week. On Thursday, the judge ruled in Bitfinex's favor, writing:  ""OAG's request to order Respondents to search for and collect all documents and information called for in the §354 Order is denied as inconsistent with the order of the First Department 'stay[ing] enforcement of the [§354 Order] pending hearing and determination of the appeal.'""  However, a second request – that an injunction preventing Tether from lending any further funds to Bitfinex be extended – was granted. The respondents did not oppose this request.  ""The injunction is hereby extended pending the hearing and determination of the appeal and, if OAG prevails on that appeal, for 90 days thereafter,"" the judge wrote. ""The procedure for OAG to seek further extension of the injunction remains as set forth in the Court's May 16 Order.""  Bitfinex's legal fight with the NYAG began in April 2019, when the state prosecutor first alleged that Bitfinex had lost access to $850 million in funds held by Crypto Capital Corp., a payment processor whose operators were later indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice. Stablecoin issuer Tether extended a line of credit and provided a loan to Bitfinex to cover the shortfall. The NYAG's office requested access to the documents surrounding this deal.  While Judge Cohen ruled in the NYAG's favor over the summer, the companies secured a temporary appeal last month. They now have until November to ""perfect"" the appeal, with arguments to be heard in court early next year.  In a statement sent to CoinDesk, Bitfinex and Tether general counsel Stuart Hoegner said, ""We are pleased by Judge Cohen's decision of Oct. 9th. A stay is a stay. We have consistently complied with the court's orders in this matter, and we will continue to do so. We continue to look forward to addressing these important issues before the appellate court.""

42403335,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfmG7,1570717227,CFTC Chairman Confirms Ether Cryptocurrency Is a Commodity,"CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert has said ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is a commodity.  Speaking at the Yahoo! Finance All Markets Summit Thursday, Tarbert said he believes ether is not a security.  ""We've been very clear on bitcoin: bitcoin is a commodity. We haven't said anything about ether – until now,” Tarbert said. “It is my view as chairman of the CFTC that ether is a commodity.”  Tarbert continued to say the CFTC is working with the SEC on the two cryptocurrencies and have agreed both are not securities. Going forward, the CFTC may allow ether futures to trade on U.S. markets, he suggested.  In May, a senior CFTC official told CoinDesk the agency was ready to approve an ethereum futures contract if it met the correct conditions.  Concerning currencies created by hard forks, Tarbert argued the CFTC's treatment of each new coin should depend on its creation.  The chairman said:    “It stands to reason that similar assets should be treated similarly. If the underlying asset, the original digital asset, hasn’t been determined to be a security and is therefore a commodity, most likely the forked asset will be the same. Unless the fork itself raises some securities law issues under that classic Howey Test.”            Tarbert further addressed the Facebook-led Libra project, saying the major federal regulators are looking at the planned stablecoin and it has yet to be determined whether it falls into the security classification.  ""Is it a security, first and foremost. And if it isn't a security, it is most likely a commodity,"" he said.  Later in his discussion, Tarbert announced that the CFC has appointed a new director of LabCFTC, the agency's experimental fintech initiative.  Taking on the role is Melissa Netram, formerly director of global public policy and regulatory affairs for financial software company Intuit. Netram also comes with experience in financial services at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

42403323,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfm5I,1570712404,Lending Protocol Founders to Launch 'Neo-Bank' Offering Interest on USDC,"The founders of lending protocol Nuo are launching a “neo-bank” to attract more retail users.  Varun Deshpande, Ratnesh Ray and Siddharth Verma – who launched the Nuo protocol in 2018 – are now launching a new digital banking platform called Juno.  Juno will be built on top of ethereum, rely on the Nuo protocol and is expected to launch in either February or March of 2020, Deshpande told CoinDesk.  The startup’s flagship product will allow users to hold the dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin and earn a 5.5 percent annual interest rate. Juno wallets will have no fees and a Venmo-style peer-to-peer payment option, Deshpande added.  “What Juno will be able to add is a very simple user experience which is required for retail adoption,” Deshpande said, adding:  “If there’s anything that can take DeFi [decentralized finance] or crypto mainstream, it would be an interest rate.”  It’s not the first time a DeFi platform has created a savings product, however.  In August, lending startup Dharma announced it would relaunch its services with stablecoin accounts that offer returns based on the Compound lending protocol. Dharma’s site currently advertises an interest rate of 7.7 percent. Two other lenders, Celsius and Nexo, offer returns on USDC deposits of 8.2 percent and 8 percent, respectively.  Earlier this month, crypto unicorn Coinbase announced that users of the exchange would earn an annual percentage yield of 1.25 percent on USDC holdings.  Juno plans to launch initially in the U.S., Europe, Singapore and Japan. The platform plans to partner with online money transmitters in each of these geographies for on-ramp capabilities, Deshpande said. Partnerships with local banks in each market could one day lead to debit cards and free cross-border payments, he added.  Investor buy-in  Juno is also announcing that it raised $3 million in venture capital in a round jointly led by Polychain Capital and Sequoia Capital’s Surge program.  The round included participation from Dragonfly Capital, ConsenSys Labs, Astarc Ventures, Singapore Angel Network and several angel investors, including Balaji Srinivasan, the ex-chief technology officer of Coinbase and former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).  Prior to this round, Nuo received investments of $500,000 from ConsenSys Labs and $250,000 from payments firm PayU.  Deshpande explained that the platform will be able to offer its 5.5 percent yield from the interest it makes from short-term, crypto-collateralized loans – as well as loans for margin trading that it makes through Nuo.  Nuo currently has $25 million in deposits and $20 million in loans disbursed. Deshpande says Juno’s deposits will be insured by a price volatility insurance fund that Nuo is building and smart-contract insurance.

According to a notice from the exchange on Thursday, the planned suspension of both zcash (ZEC) and dash (DASH) support has been put under review.  OKEX first announced its intentions to delist five privacy coins – also including monero (XMR), horizen (ZEN) and super bitcoin (SBTC) – in September citing FATF's controversial ""travel rule"" for crypto asset service providers, which sets out how national regulators must oversee the industry.  Under the travel rule, crypto exchanges must be able to collect and disseminate relevant information for transaction monitoring such as the name and address of the sender and recipient of virtual currencies.  Monero, horizen and super bitcoin are still being delisted from the exchange as of today, Oct. 10, OKEx said. A final decision on zcash and dash support will be announced after the compliance review.  Speaking with CoinDesk via email, Josh Swihart, VP of marketing and business development at the Electric Coin Company – the co-developer of zcash – said his firm has been working with OKEx since the September announcement.  He commented:  ""Zcash is entirely compatible with all FATF recommendations including the travel rule. We’ve been working with OKEx and others in S. Korea and happy to hear that OKEx has decided to take additional time to further evaluate Zcash support based on newly available compliance information.""  Since FATF's announcement, there has been increasing pressure for exchanges to drop support for privacy coins.  Notably, Coinbase dropped zcash from its U.K. exchange in early August. A source told CoinDesk that the move was in relation to forming a new banking relationship with ClearBank after Barclays withdrew its services from the company.  South Korean exchange Upbit also dropped zcash recently.  The Electric Coin Company has been actively lobbying regulators and lawmakers over its cryptocurrency, according to Swihart.  An open brief on regulation and compliance posted in September stated:  ""Zcash was designed to protect consumers’ financial privacy while retaining compatibility with global AML / CFT standards, including the FATF Recommendations that were adopted in June 2019. Importantly, the privacy provided by Zcash does not prevent regulated entities from fulfilling their regulatory obligations.""

The top cryptocurrency by market value hit a two-week high of $8,708 on Bitstamp and retreated to levels below $8,550 before CoinDesk reported the SEC's decision at 21:45 UTC yesterday.  However, BTC remained bid following the negative news and has been restricted largely to a narrow range of $8,500–$8,650 in the hours since.  The cryptocurrency's resilience is not surprising, as the market had set its bar of expectations low following the regulator's repeated rejection of various ETF proposals over the last 12 months. Further, the low odds of the SEC approving the ETF had been priced in long ago, according to popular analyst Alex Kruger.  Bitcoin's ability to hold on to gains may indicate Wednesday's rally was primarily driven by the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to expand its balance sheet again.  Many observers had associated the price rise with speculation that the SEC might approve a new bitcoin-based ETF. If that had been the case, the cryptocurrency would have faced a sell-off following the regulator's decision.  All-in-all, the doors remain open for BTC to continue rising amid the Fed's move to increase its balance. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,530 on Bitstamp, representing 3.54 percent gains on a 24-hour basis.  Short-term technical studies are calling a move higher toward $9,000, as seen below.  Daily chart and weekly chart  Bitcoin jumped 5 percent on Wednesday, confirming the impending trend reversal signaled by Monday's bullish outside-bar candlestick pattern.  The MACD histogram is now producing higher bars above the zero line, indicating a strengthening of bullish momentum.  Hence, BTC could find acceptance above the 200-day moving average (MA) resistance at $8,632 and rise toward the former support-turned-resistance of $9,049 in the short-term.  On the way higher, BTC could face resistance at $8,951 – the descending (bearish) 5-week moving average.  4-hour chart  BTC jumped above $8,531 yesterday, confirming a double bottom breakout on the 4-hour chart and opening the doors for $9,348 (target as per the measured move method).  So far, the follow-through has been poor and the cryptocurrency is now teasing a drop below the former resistance-turned-support of $8,531.  That, however, should not be a cause for concern for the bulls, as markets often shake out weak hands by testing dip demand before building on a bullish breakout.  Moreover, the short-term bullish case will remain intact as long as prices are holding above the higher low of $8,110 created on Oct. 9.

Customers can initiate transfers using credit or debit cards registered with Samsung Pay, and the money can be sent to designated recipients as cash or to their bank accounts.  The company said in an announcement that the transactions will be transparent, with all fees and rates disclosed at the time of the exchange, though no pricing was made available in the announcement. Tokenized credentials are used and Samsung Knox will store the keys.  Transfers can be sent to 47 countries, including Australia, Britain, Canada, China, Germany, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, Thailand and Vietnam.  The service is restricted to customers with Samsung devices. In a statement, Sang W.

Launched in 2015 and receiving regulatory approval for crypto derivatives in the U.K. earlier this year, B2C2 offers bulk crypto purchases through its API service.  With the firm's new product, clients can physically settle synthetic trades with bitcoin, which correspond to physical gold stored in vaults. Synthetic positions combine various underlying assets to mimic the returns of another product without actually holding the product.  The firm told CoinDesk in an email that the benefit of the setup is that ""it's simpler to trade than the cash underlier for a variety of operational reasons, and typically represents the majority of activity in the product/asset.""  Clients can settle the trade with a number of cryptocurrencies. ""These tokens will give them access to the underlying metal since they correspond to ownership of physical gold in vaults,"" B2C2 said.  In a statement, founder and CEO of B2C2 Max Boonen said the gold and bitcoin's roles as haven assets spurred the products development:  “The current macro environment, dominated by uncertainty over economic growth and inflation, is prompting central banks to rethink monetary policy and market participants to reassess the likely path of interest rates.”  Year-to-date, bitcoin’s price has doubled followed by a 15 percent bump for gold, currently sitting at $1,500 per ounce.  “Conflicting narratives abound, fueling market activity, and we expect demand to only grow for ways to gain and manage exposure to deflationary assets such as gold and bitcoin,"" Boonen added.  However, as CoinDesk previously reported, bitcoin’s recent price moves have not been fully indicative of the digital gold mantra its proponents have rallied behind.  Fears of a U.S. recession have resurfaced in recent days and the resulting risk aversion quickly brought a boost to gold prices. Bitcoin, though, has been somewhat slower to pick up bids.

42403319,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfm2L,1570685588,"7 Ethereum Projects Are Getting $175,000 in Grants From ConsenSys","Venture studio ConsenSys is giving $175,000 to seven different open-source software projects on the ethereum network.  Announced on Oct. 10, these projects include a forward-looking ethereum software client called Lighthouse, an oracle network for off-chain data called Tellor and a mobile decentralized app-builder called Alice, among others.  About the new wave of grant recipients, ConsenSys Head of Experiential Marketing Yadira Blocker said:  “In Wave 1, we saw a lot of applications but they weren’t super strong. In Wave 2, we started to see more credible teams and more unique ideas come to the table.”  So far, the ConsenSys grants program, which launched in February 2019, has received over 150 applications, according to Blocker. Of those 150, 15 projects have been funded to the tune of $330,000 so far.  As announced in September, the third wave of ConsenSys grants is now open for applications with a remaining $220,000 left to give away.  ConsenSys marketing director Daniela Osorio says the purpose of the program is to support under-resourced areas of development that are integral to the ethereum ecosystem but not necessarily profitable.  “The way we find really great projects is we talk to VCs and we ask, ‘What are some great teams you’ve come across that you can’t actually justify funding?’” said Osorio, adding:  “It comes down to this theory of the 'tragedy of the commons.' We all need certain pieces to work for everyone else to build something potentially more profitable on top.”  CLR matching  ConsenSys-backed ethereum bounties network Gitcoin is currently experimenting with a novel form of grant distribution called Capital-constrained Liberal Radicalism (CLR) matching.  According to Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki, CLR matching is the “mathematically optimal way to fund projects people care about.”  The basic idea is that the more individual contributions a project gets, the more money that project should receive from a dedicated grants fund. Using a special algorithm, Gitcoin is able to distribute grant money to match user donations in an impactful way.  Or, put another way: The more individual contributions that are made to a project, the higher the value of grant money that is distributed to that project.  On Oct. 2., Gitcoin concluded its third wave of CLR grant funding, which saw the distribution of $100,000 to 80 open source initiatives.  About the continuation of grant funding innovations, Osorio said:  “I don’t know if there’s ever enough money for people’s academic and research pursuits but I think there’s definitely a lot more community-driven efforts to address the notion and need for public goods funding.”  Joseph Lubin image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/10/7-ethereum-projects-are-getting-175000-in-grants-from-consensys,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7c2942749ac72d8185f35b1b0c468bba88b3851-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
