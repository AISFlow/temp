42426615,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuNTh,1450987206,Bitcoin is Entering the Age of Practicality,"Lamar Wilson is a programmer, web developer, serial entrepreneur and loving father. He co-founded the software development firm 212ths with his long-time friend and co-founder of Fluent, Lafe Taylor. Lamar is co-founder and CEO of Fluent, a B2B payment platform built on the blockchain.  As the end of the year approaches, it is customary to begin thinking of what's next.  We try to assess what changes can be made to better our lives, our businesses and our relationships. We ask what can we do differently that will push us positively towards our anticipated outcomes.  In the spirit of this thinking, let's discuss bitcoin and blockchain technologies.  Bitcoin and blockchain technologies are still in their infancy. Yet, millions of dollars have been invested and many companies have reaped tremendously from early adoption.  But, it's important to note that the companies that have had the most success have done so by creating a foundation for the entire industry.  As when building a house, the foundation is the first and possibly the most important element. Without it, the house would fall, and any good builder knows that you have to give the foundation a chance to cure before building on top of it.  The companies we'll list below have built a pretty solid foundation on top of the ground that the core developers provided. The only problem is, sleeping on a concrete slab can prove to be uncomfortable.  Enter the age of practicality.  The next steps  With the foundation laid, it is time to begin building practical solutions to real-world problems.  People want to put all kinds of things on the blockchain – from gold to furniture receipts. If it exists, someone has pitched that it should be on a blockchain. But the blockchain is not some magic wand that solves all problems.  The blockchain, at its core, is a database. It may be the Liam Neeson of databases, but still it's a database.  This new age of practicality must be filled with companies solving real problems – problems that could not be solved before the gift Satoshi left for us (before returning to his alternate dimension).  We as an industry must be able to look into every industry and every discipline and see what challenges a distributed, immutable ledger can really solve.  We have debated on Reddit and other forums about what can be. But the new age must be filled with companies that not only see what can be, but build what should be.  We have to embrace people from all disciplines and lend a ear to what struggles they have. We have to then be creative enough to innovate through cross-discipline association.  The good examples  There are a handful of companies that have already prepared us for this future.  Companies like Blockcypher have become the Amazon Web Services for blockchain tech. They began with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin, and because of this early versatility, can now easily create private blockchain solutions with their full suite of tools.  Companies like Coinbase and BitGo have become the 'First National Banks of Bitcoin', and are expanding to be Global Bitcoin and FX banks. They are providing a foundation for developers to build all types of transaction-heavy applications.  Elsewhere, Zapchain has taken full advantage of the simple API Coinbase provides for tipping to reimagine social communities.  Chain  and the recently acquired Blockstack.io, focus (or focused) heavily on private blockchains and the tools to interact with them. R3 has done a great job of grabbing a piece of mindshare at some of the largest banks in the world, creating a foundation for meaningful engagement with incumbents.  Michael J Casey at MIT Media Lab is helping to lead us toward this age by encouraging the MIT Sloan School of Management and the MIT School of Engineering to work together on blockchain technology, combining two world-class schools at a world-class institution.  These types of actions will begin to create the walls of our industry's house. They will help discover new problems that we can then solve with technology.  At Fluent, we've found a very specific problem by talking to industry leaders and professionals about issues in their supply chains. Equipped with our knowledge of blockchain technology, we were able to build a solution that will solve this problem in a way that was impossible without the core technology.  The beginning of the new year will be filled with optimism and glee, but when the confetti is cleared, we'll need to move forward toward solving real issues.  Bring on the age of practicality.

42426602,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuN9h,1450969918,South Korea's Shinhan Bank Backs Blockchain Startup's $2 Million Round,"Blockchain remittance startup Streami has closed a $2m seed funding round.      Despite the startup's newcomer status, however, its backers to date include Shinhan Bank, one of South Korea's largest financial services providers. The bank committed ₩500m (roughly $427,000) to the funding round.      Streami also drew support from Shinhan Data Systems, an IT entity within Shinhan; ICB, a payments firm known for working with Asian e-commerce giant Alibaba; venture firm Bluepoint Partners, and a group of angel investors.      By targeting the Asian remittance market from South Korea to China, including markets such as Philippines, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand, Streami seeks to help people bypass illegal money transmission services in the area.      Junhaeng Lee, CEO and founder, told CoinDesk via email:    ""Streami's main competitors, as of now, are traditional remittance service providers in general and illegal money transmitters that are estimated to take up significant Korea-outbound remittances market share.""  ""Streami will bring trusted, regulated liquidity into the crypto networks,"" he added.  The funding, Lee told CoinDesk, will be used to open branches in cities beyond Seoul and recruit new talent.  Although the startup is pre-revenue, it said it plans to eventually do so by taking service fees from institutional clients.  ICB CEO Han Yong Lee told CoinDesk that his firm took part in the round to facilitate further exploration of the technology.  ""We hope to provide better services with blockchain-based foreign currency remittance FinTech services and collaboration with Streami. Moreover, we made an investment in Streami because we believe in their potential,"" he said.

42426610,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuNLh,1450966833,What the Blockchain Means for Economic Prosperity,"Don Tapscott is the author of 15 books about the digital revolution in business and society, and chancellor of Trent University. Alex Tapscott is the CEO of North West Passage Ventures, an advisory firm building early stage companies in the blockchain space.  Together, they are authors of the upcoming book, Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business and the World.  The Internet is entering a second era, one that gives us another shot to achieve a prosperous future.  Yes, the digital revolution has brought countless wonders. The Internet, the World Wide Web, social media, mobile computing, geospaciality, Big Data and the cloud have all enabled advancements in virtually every aspect of life.  But when it comes to business, a careful analysis shows that the changes to date are only scratching the surface.  Capitalism's basic institution, the corporation, has remained relatively unchanged. Hierarchy, vertical integration and bureaucracy – hallmarks of the industrial age – still reign.  When it comes to the economy as a whole, the digital revolution has not had a positive impact on prosperity for most. There is real creation taking place but, paradoxically, social inequality is growing.  The economies of many developed countries are growing, but for the first time in history there is no commensurate job creation.  Privacy, the foundation of a free society, is being undermined by data 'frackers' and governments everywhere are using the Internet to create the surveillance society.  Two billion people don’t have a bank account or participate in the global economy at all.  An incomplete Internet  Rather than the solution, technology has been a big part of the problem, and not just because a new round of automation – robotics or disruptive business models are wiping out parts of the workforce.  The old paradigm in technology and media, whether broadcasting, print or mainframe computing, was to make things centralized and to control them with powerful forces. The recipients were passive.  The new paradigm was supposed to be distributed, controlled by everyone and empowering to active participants.  However, the distributed Internet was dropped into an economy that has concentrated power structures with the asymmetrical ability to shape it for their own purposes.  Wealth, prosperity and freedom have arrived, but only for the few.  Without an economic layer to the Internet, we can’t establish each other's identity or trust each other to transact without validation from a third party like a bank or a government.  Quite the opposite: It allows people to commit fraud, collect our data and invade our privacy. It excludes 2.5 billion people from the global financial system. It channels power and prosperity to those who already have it, even if they're no longer earning it.  What if the next generation of the Internet enabled not just the communication of information but the direct communication of value and money? What if we could build businesses, send transactions directly, peer-to-peer without powerful intermediaries?  Enter the blockchain  Well it’s happening. The digital revolution is bringing a new and radically different platform for business and other institutions that can take us through the next quarter century of human progress.  At the core is the biggest innovation in computer science in a generation. It is the technology underlying the digital currency bitcoin – the blockchain.  This technology platform is open and programmable. As such, it holds the potential for unleashing countless new applications and as-yet-unrealized capabilities that have the potential to transform everything in the next 25 years.  At its core, the blockchain is a global database – an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions, but virtually everything of value and importance to humankind: birth and death certificates, marriage licenses, deeds and titles of ownership, educational degrees, financial accounts, medical procedures, insurance claims, votes, transactions between smart objects and anything else that can be expressed in code.  This ledger represents the truth because mass collaboration constantly reconciles it. We will not need to trust each other in the traditional sense because the new platform ensures integrity.  Think trust achieved through clever code and mass collaboration.  Fulfilling the vision  Today, the new platform enables a reconciliation of digital records – call it The Digital Reconciliation.  The Internet of Everything needs a Ledger of Everything. Business, commerce and the economy need a Digital Reckoning. Get ready for the World Wide Ledger.  We believe the truth can set us free and distributed trust will profoundly affect people in all walks of life.  Maybe you're a music lover who wants artists to make a living off their art. Or a consumer who wants to know where that hamburger meat came from. Perhaps you’re an immigrant who’s sick of paying big fees to send money home to loved ones in your ancestral land. Or a Saudi woman who wants to buy a fashion magazine.  Maybe you’re an aid worker who needs to identify landowners so that you can rebuild their homes after an earthquake. Or a citizen fed up with the lack of transparency and accountability of political leaders. Or a user of social media who thinks all the data you generate might be worth something – to you – and that your privacy matters.  Even as we write, innovators are building blockchain-based applications that serve these ends. And they are just the beginning.
