42382777,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ssZx,1570057684,US Lawmakers Ask Fed to Consider Developing 'National Digital Currency',"UPDATE (Oct. 4, 2019, 20:50 UTC): A spokesperson for the Federal Reserve told CoinDesk, ""We have received the letter and plan to respond.""      Two U.S. lawmakers want the Federal Reserve to consider creating a digital dollar.  In a letter sent to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell  , Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) and Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) outline concerns they have about risks to the U.S. dollar if another country or private company creates a widely used cryptocurrency, and ask whether the central bank is looking into creating its own version.  First reported by Bloomberg Law  , the letter details how the Fed has the right to create and manage U.S. currency policy.  ""The Federal Reserve, as the central bank of the United States, has the ability and the natural role to develop a national digital currency,"" the Congressmen wrote, adding:  ""We are concerned that the primacy of the U.S. Dollar could be in long-term jeopardy from wide adoption of digital fiat currencies. Internationally, the Bank for International Settlements conducted a study that found that over 40 countries around the world have currently developed or are looking into developing a digital currency.""  Indeed, there have been some calls for the global financial system to move away from the dollar. Most notably, Bank of England governor Mark Carney suggested that a digital currency backed by a basket of other financial instruments might help nations make this shift.  In Monday's letter, Foster and Hill wrote that cryptocurrencies are currently used for speculative purposes in the U.S., but their use may ""increasingly align with that of paper money in the future.""  The U.S. should not rely on private companies to develop digital currencies, they wrote. The letter specifically mentions the Facebook-led Libra stablecoin.  ""The Facebook/Libra proposal, if implemented,"" the congressmen wrote, ""could remove important aspects of financial governance outside of U.S. jurisdiction.""  The letter goes on to mention recent cryptocurrency efforts by J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo.  Path forward  The letter asks a number of questions, including whether the Fed is currently looking into developing a digital currency, whether there are any contingency plans if digital fiat currencies gain traction, what legal, regulatory or national security issues might prevent the Fed from developing a digital currency, what market risks or other issues might result from a Fed cryptocurrency and what benefits there might be to the project.  Hill and Foster are not the only individuals to suggest that the Fed might benefit from creating its own cryptocurrency. Last year, former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Sheila Bair also recommended the Fed look into creating a digital currency as a way of avoiding being disrupted by the private sector or another nation.  The Federal Reserve is also looking to create a real-time payments system, though it is unclear whether there will be a cryptocurrency-like aspect to it.  In the letter, the Congressmen suggest that it might even be an urgent matter for the Fed, writing:  ""With the potential for digital currencies to further take on the characteristics and utility of paper money, it may become increasingly imperative that the Federal Reserve take up the project of developing a U.S. dollar digital currency.""  A message left with the Federal Reserve's press office was not immediately returned.  Update (Oct. 3, 16:52 UTC): Following the publication of this article, a spokesperson for Hill told CoinDesk that the Congressman does not have a position on the Fed creating a digital currency, and considers the correspondence ""more of a fact finding letter.""

In April 2018, the Dubai government announced the Emirates Blockchain Strategy 2021, where the UAE government will migrate 50 percent of its transactions – such as visa applications and bill payments – to a blockchain platform.  Upon Blocko’s official launch, the company entered a business and technology partnership with SEED Group, a conglomerate in royal family member Sheikh Saeed bin Ahmed Al Maktoum’s private office.  “It will enable the UAE to make its digital promise a reality for its government departments, citizens and businesses,” Hisham Al Gurg, CEO of SEED Group and the Private Office of Sheikh Saeed bin Ahmed Al Maktoum, said.  The Emirates Blockchain Strategy is expected to generate annual savings of $3 billion in transaction and document costs, eliminating 398 million printed documents and 77 million work hours.  Dubai has made multiple efforts to push forward the initiative, including regulatory reforms and a partnership with IBM for a city-wide blockchain project.  Before entering the UAE, the blockchain provider raised $16.5 million through two Series B rounds including an $8.9 million financing last June and a $7.4 million funding round in August.  Korea’s oldest bank, Shinhan, KEB Hana Bank, private equity firm LB Investment and Dadam Investment participated in the August financing, the company said.  Blocko will team up with Aergo, an operating platform to implement hybrid public-private blockchain technology for both government and enterprises in UAE.  “The company is now focusing efforts on bringing the Aergo platform to enterprises in the Middle East, looking to replicate its success in Asia and Europe,” according to Blocko.  “Many blockchain technologies in the Middle East are still in the proof-of-concept phase, Phil Zamani, the CEO of Blocko and co-founder of Aergo, said.  “As a hybrid blockchain, Aergo breaks through these barriers, unlocking new features that provide increased levels of efficiency, security, scalability and value.” he said.  Blocko is currently supporting more than 20 enterprise clients, aiming for 25 million daily users by supporting government bodies and other large enterprises in the Middle East.  The company rose to fame in South Korea after it became the full-scale enterprise provider for Samsung, Cisco, Hyundai Motors, and Gyeonggi-do province. It has offered 38 such blockchain solutions in the country.  Hong Kong-based platform Aergo secured $30 million from a syndicate led by investors Sequoia Capital China and GBIC, the company said.

42382784,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ssez,1570043120,"It's Too Soon to Write Off Bakkt, Wall Street Analyst Tells ICE Investors","It’s too soon to write off Bakkt, despite the bitcoin futures market’s disappointingly slow start, analysts at Oppenheimer & Co. said.  In an Oct. 1 research note, the equity research firm encourages investors to “not get upset” about the lackluster trading volume of Bakkt. For one thing, its parent company, Intercontinental Exchange, has plenty of other electronification initiatives in fixed income analytics and trading, mortgages and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), wrote Oppenheimer senior analyst Own Lau and managing director Chris Kotowski.  Bakkt’s average daily futures volume was 125 contracts, each for one bitcoin, for the first five days of trading, the analysts noted. This pales in comparison to the 2017 debut of bitcoin futures on CBOE, where the average volume was 4,000 contracts daily in the first month, and at CME, where it was 500 contracts for 5 bitcoin each, totaling 2,500 bitcoin daily.  CME reached out to CoinDesk to dispute Oppenheimer's numbers, stating that the futures were launched on Dec. 18, 2017 and that CME's contracts only traded for nine days, whereas the Oppenheimer research assumes that it traded for 20 days. This would mean that CME's 9,503 total futures contracts traded during that month would have translated to an average daily trading volume of 1,056 contracts or 5,280 bitcoin.  Unlike those two Chicago exchanges’ bitcoin futures, which are essentially side-bets on the direction of the underlying asset’s price paid out in cash, Bakkt’s are settled in actual bitcoin.  “At this point, we are not going to judge whether Bakkt’s bitcoin futures will be successful or not, or whether the trading volume of Bakkt’s bitcoin futures will increase in the future,” the note says. “We acknowledge that a massive adoption of bitcoin, or any other digital asset, outside of crypto enthusiasts has a long way to go, but also don’t discount that the initial bitcoin futures trading volume introduced by Bakkt didn't seem to meet the original expectation.”  The note also points out that since the first month CBOE’s average daily volume has been declining, leading it to stop listing bitcoin futures in June of this year, while CME’s average daily volume has been increasing, to 7,000 in July.  Bitcoin might not be the digital coin that gains mass adoption, the analysts went on, and CME and ICE are prepared for the emergence of digital assets with the right infrastructure in place. The research firm pointed to CME’s plans to release bitcoin options in Q1 as proof that there is still interest from institutions in these alternative financial instruments.

42382776,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ssPt,1570039246,Parity Updates Tech to Let You Turn Old Phones Into Cold Storage Crypto Wallets,"Parity Technologies released a new version of Parity Signer, a mobile application that turns old smartphones into offline wallets.  The company announced the V3 beta on Wednesday, which will enable users to store assets, vote for governance proposals and sign transactions offline, with integrations for both the Polkadot and Ethereum blockchains.  Offline, or ""air-gapped,"" wallets provide the simplest form of protection from hackers and malware attacks. The company suggests that smartphones running the app be kept on airplane mode.  “To keep your funds safe, the phone containing your accounts should never be connected to the internet or even be connected to a device that is connected to the internet (such as a computer),” the company said. Users should also wipe their phones of biometric and identifying information in a factory reset prior to downloading the app.  The new version allows users to create Kusama accounts to connect with Polkadot-js apps. For all accounts, users will receive a recovery phrase and choose a ""pin"" to sign transactions. Transfers do not involve private keys, but instead utilize the industry standard QR code for two-way communication between hot wallets and cold signers.  The app's code was audited during a recent overview of the entire company performed by Trail of Bits.  Parity was co-founded by former Ethereum Foundation security chief Jutta Steiner and Gavin Wood. The company develops tools for the decentralized web, including Substrate, a service that lets users create customized blockchains for decentralized applications.  In January, Parity was awarded a $5 million grant from the Ethereum Foundation.

42382782,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ssdj,1570035601,Coinbase to Pay Users 1.25% Interest on USDC Stablecoin Holdings,"You don’t have to be a trader on Coinbase to make a profit.  Starting Wednesday, customers of the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange can earn interest on their holdings of the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC. The annual percentage yield (APY) is 1.25 percent.  “We’re trying to build more ways for customers to grow their wealth on Coinbase,” said Coinbase product manager Paul Katsen, adding:  “One of the things we know is a bad customer experience is having to move your money back and forth from Coinbase to a bank account [to] earn a little bit of interest in the bank account. We’re trying to bring some of these experiences together but make them crypto-first and on Coinbase.”  Users of the exchange with at least one dollar’s worth of USDC in their accounts will automatically begin to accrue rewards on their holdings, with no additional cost or fees.  Paid out to users on a monthly basis, all rewards earned on Coinbase can be tracked in real-time and subsequently used instantaneously to buy other cryptocurrencies listed on the exchange.  “The user experience is really super smooth and simple,” said Coinbase director of product Max Branzburg. “As soon as you have USDC in your account, you start earning rewards and you can see reward counting up in real-time so you know at any given time exactly how much you’re earning. You can use that right then and there on the platform to buy any other crypto.”  When asked how Coinbase was financing this initiative, Branzburg explained the company would be pulling from different pre-existing revenue streams. ""From trading, from [Coinbase's] custody business, from treasury management, investment activity, etc.,"" he said.  ""We can pull from the profits we generate as a business to reward our customers for storing their assets on the platform, "" Branzburg said, adding:  ""We're fortunate to be able to do that as a profitable business.""  Relating to how the USDC Rewards program compares to existing bank rates in the U.S., Branzburg noted that a 1.25 percent interest rate on holdings of U.S. dollars is “15 times more than the national average or what people might get through a [traditional] savings account.”  While the rates are lower than what a user could benefit from on decentralized financial (DeFi) applications such as Compound or dYdX, Branzburg said the USDC Rewards program makes earning interest on USDC exceptionally easy for consumers since they no longer have to move money into a separate application or account.  “Particularly for developing economies, giving the ability for people to hold USD-equivalent funds and get something like [1.25 percent] interest a year … is really tremendous,” said Joao Reginatto, director of product management at crypto finance startup Circle, which launched USDC in partnership with Coinbase. “We see a lot of demand from consumers in developing economies, especially.”  ‘Top of mind’  Outside of Coinbase, Circle is currently the only other approved entity to issue new USDC coins.  Together, Coinbase and Circle make up the CIRCLE consortium meant to drive adoption for the USDC stablecoin and provide a governance framework for its continued development.  Between the two startups, over 1 billion dollars worth of USDC has been issued since Sept. 26, 2018https://www.centre.io/pdfs/usdc-report-sept-2019.pdf.  Beyond USDC, Coinbase’s Branzburg says similar programs could exist in the future for other cryptocurrencies on the exchange.  “We see this as the beginning of long-term investment in generating rewards for customers. … We’ll continue to explore additional ways to bring even more rewards to our customers,” said Branzburg, adding:  “We’re considering different assets and different geographies. Continuing to create more value for our customers is always top of mind for Coinbase.”  USDC logo image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING | USDC,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/02/coinbase-to-pay-users-125-interest-on-usdc-stablecoin-holdings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ff20dcdc35d547860c8ad6486814ba8fbab8d78-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a newly disclosed letter, written by senior enforcement counsel John Castiglione and filed on Sept. 30, the NYAG's office outlines how Bitfinex and Tether, as well as other affiliated entities, have not produced any documents pertaining to an alleged cover-up of an inter-company loan.  The NYAG's office revealed it was looking into Bitfinex, its sister stablecoin issuer Tether, and a number of other entities and individuals affiliated with the companies in April, alleging that Bitfinex lost access to nearly $1 billion in customer and corporate funds.  Further, the NYAG's office alleged, Bitfinex made up the shortfall by borrowing from Tether's reserves, which were meant to back its USDT stablecoin. The state legal enforcer successfully argued before New York Supreme Court Judge Joel Cohen that the respondents should turn over a number of documents about these alleged transactions, as well as halt any further lending by Tether to Bitfinex.  While the judge did rule in the NYAG's favor, Bitfinex immediately appealed and secured a temporary stay over the document production requirements last month, and has until November to ""perfect"" its appeal.  Castiglione wrote Tuesday that the companies did not follow the court order before the stay was granted, saying:  ""Even though one month elapsed between the issuance of this Court's August 19 Order and the stay, no documents were produced. That means that since the granting of the 354 Order in April, Respondents have failed to produce a single non-jurisdictional document.""  Dawdling on documents  The appeal will draw the case out for several more months, during which time no documents will be produced, Castiglione wrote Tuesday.  Because of this, he asked Judge Cohen to have the respondents compile all of the necessary responsive documents now, ""so that full and immediate production can be made to the OAG once the appeal concludes.""  If the judge does not order the companies to produce these documents, then they will most likely continue delaying, Castiglione wrote, saying:  ""Unless the Court directs Respondents to collect these materials now, what will happen is predictable: Respondents will, upon lifting of the stay, argue for more time to search and collect materials, file more motions challenging the scope of the 354 Order, and otherwise take whatever steps they believe will be tolerated by the Court to further delay the OAG' s investigation.""  ""By ordering Respondents to get materials in order now, the Court will ensure an orderly process and will facilitate the conclusion of the OAG' s investigation,"" he added.  Stuart Hoegner, General Counsel to Bitfinex and Tether, told CoinDesk that the companies ""remain pleased"" with the appellate division's order last month granting the stay.  ""We will reserve any further comment in this matter until we respond directly to the court,"" he said.

42382765,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ssKr,1570032014,Six Major Japanese Brokerages Form Security Token Offering Association,"A new association in Japan brings significant institutional support to security token offerings (STO), just months before regulations on the public sale of coins in the country are to be implemented.  On Oct. 1, six major Japanese brokerages, including Nomura Securities and Daiwa Securities, formed the Japan STO Association, a self-regulatory organization (SRO) for STOs.  Old and new are joining forces in the grouping. In addition the two core members of the brokerage establishment, the association also includes a number of younger players, all founded in 1999 and focused on online trading: kabu.com Securities, Monex, Rakuten Securities and SBI SECURITIES.  SMBC Nikko Securities is notably absent from the collaboration.  The association will devise rules and guidelines for the issuing of security tokens. In addition to regulating its members, the group will also take on lobbying duties, endeavoring to develop security tokens as a product and promote their use in the country.  ""The Japan STO Association intends to consolidate expertise on securities businesses from among securities companies and other entities so that the STO business opportunities can be explored and developed in Japan,"" Monex said in a statement.  Japan has lagged much of the world in terms of coin offerings, as the existing law does not adequately support the public sale of cryptocurrencies. But earlier this year, legislative advances set the groundwork for the issuing of security tokens.  In May 2019, the Act on Settlement of Funds and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act were amended to regulate the sale of the coins. The offerings will be treated very much like offerings of conventional securities. Certain disclosures will be required, and the brokers will have to be registered.  It is expected that the disclosures might be more detailed than those required for conventional securities given that the structuring and design of the tokens will have to be explained, according to an article by Greenberg Traurig.  Security tokens will be considered ""interests in a collective investment scheme,"" and the buyers of them will have the right to receive distributions from the business of the issuer.  The new regulations will be in force once implementing orders and ordinances are issued by Japan's Financial Services Agency.  A Japan Security Token Business Association was formed in January and a Japan Security Token Association was established in May, but both operate more like trade associations than self-regulatory organizations.

According to Slovenian news site 24UR.com, Matjaz Skorjanec was apprehended by German federal police last Monday. The U.S. Department of Justice has released a warrant for his extradition.  Matjaz Skorjanec is wanted in the U.S. for founding and running the cybercrime forum Darkode from 2008 to 2013, as well as for the creation and deployment of one of the largest botnets ever, Mariposa. A U.S. federal court unsealed indictments against Skorjanc and three other individuals allegedly connected to the Darkode this summer.  The U.S. initially released an international warrant for his arrest as far back as 2011. Under U.S. law, Skorjanc could face up to 50 years in prison if convicted, according to 24UR.com.  Darkode was dismantled by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015 in conjunction with 20 other countries, according to cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs. The DOJ called the forum “one of the gravest threats to the integrity of data on computers in the United States and around the world and was the most sophisticated English-speaking forum for criminal computer hackers in the world.”  A cryptocurrency mining marketplace, NiceHash allows users to rent out their CPU power to mine cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The startup was hacked in December 2017 – at the height of the bull market – losing an estimated $63 million in bitcoin from a compromised central wallet.  Skorjanc has already served 5 years in Slovenian prison for his role in inflicting Mariposa on the world. The botnet had infected nearly 1 million computers at the time, harvesting personal data and causing an estimated $4 million in damages, according to 24UR.com.  The CEO of NiceHash's parent firm H-Bit and Skorjanc's father, Martin Škorjanc, confirmed his son’s arrest, stating that no precedent exists under international law for him to carry out two sentences for the same crime.

42382770,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ssSP,1570021259,"Ripple's Xpring Launches Crypto, Fiat Payments That Integrate Into Any App","Ripple’s Xpring is launching a platform it says makes it possible for developers to integrate fiat and cryptocurrency payments into any application.  The suite of services includes an Xpring software development kit (SDK) that allows programmers to integrate XRP apps in multiple programming languages. It also includes a variety of new tools for working on both XRP and Ripple’s Interledger Protocol (ILP).  Xpring is targeting crypto and non-crypto developers alike with the platform, Xpring senior vice president Ethan Beard told CoinDesk.  “Xpring SDK allows you the developer to use the XRP ledger simply and in any programming language you want,” Beard said, adding:  “What takes a developer today a 100 lines of code to do a transaction on XRP ledger, using Xpring SDK cuts that down by 80 percent.”  Xpring has already been built on open-source protocols, but this platform would function like Amazon Web Services, Beard said. Developers could download the code and run it themselves, or now they can go to Xpring and plug into the service.  Beard envisions the platform being used to enable micropayments in industries like media and gaming.  “Ideally, we think the Xpring platform can work for any type of payment,” Beard said.  The platform is a new vertical for Xpring, which has been an investment arm for Ripple – building a network of companies and use-cases around XRP for little over a year. This initiative is aimed at investing in and growing a developer base around the cryptocurrency.  ""While blockchain and cryptocurrency can be transformative for how payments work, what we've learned in the last year is that working with these new technologies is quite difficult as well,"" Beard said. ""That creates a barrier for developers to adopt these technologies.""  As a part of the announcement, Xpring is also announcing that payments processor BitPay, mobile wallet BRD and digital custody provider Anchorage are all adding XRP to their offerings. With BitPay on board, the company anticipates users being able to use XRP for everyday purchases at thousands of merchants, including Microsoft and AT&T.  Furthermore, Chainalysis is adding the XRP ledger to its blockchain analytics product.

42382768,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ssOd,1570021202,Pantera Leads $5 Million Round for Decentralized Derivatives Market,"A protocol built to put financial middlemen out of business has secured a $5 million seed round led by Pantera Capital.  The Vega Protocol aims to make it feasible for people anywhere in the world to spin up markets for derivatives (futures, swaps, options, etc.) that can interact with each other and abide by relevant regulations.  Other key investors joined the round, including Ripple's Xpring, Hashed and KR1. Participants purchased an as-yet-unnamed ERC-20 token that will manage staking and governance services on the blockchain, according to Vega founder Barney Mannerings.  ""We see the value to be in the network, really,"" Mannerings said, predicting that the company would shift its work to a foundation eventually.  Vega has not yet discussed what the token will do or how holding it will be beneficial. ""We will be releasing some details about the staking and validator models in the next month or two,"" he said.  The funding round will be used to build out the software to fulfill Vega's vision, and also support establishing a nascent community of developers and potential users of the protocol, Mannerings said.  Markets everywhere  Vega is a Layer 2 solution for trading derivatives in a non-custodial and secure fashion. It's not a decentralized exchange or a standalone business. It's building the software that will allow others to set up marketplaces for assets that have a time horizon.    ""It's a fairly ambitious project in terms of the complexity of the software,"" Mannerings said. ""With derivatives, the trade has a life cycle.""      For example, a trader could sell the right to buy a given asset at a given price six months out. This requires that prices are monitored, leverages are kept and risks are managed. It can require a lot of computation.      ""The ethereum network is not great at running computationally intensive,"" Mannerings said. ""We can get 10 to 100-times better performance for doing those calculations.""      It's very powerful ""compared to the slightly toylike version that can be created on the ethereum virtual machine,"" he contended.    In what Mannerings described as a sort of second release, Vega will be able to conform to the rules of any given country and verify that the user is really under that jurisdiction. Further, the software will open up tools for creating more kinds of derivatives.  Said Mannerings:  ""It's going to be a simple way for people to create basically any derivative product on earth.""  And he really does mean any on earth. The whole product suite anticipates a time when real-world securities will be tokenized and traded on these sorts of exchanges.  ""We wouldn't be doing this if we thought the only people who would be using it would be crypto-native ICOs and bitcoin and such,"" Mannerings said.  Take for example a small export business that wanted to hedge the currency risk of another nation where it ships a lot of its products. For small and medium-sized businesses, Mannerings argued, that kind of hedging can be too expensive to be worth it in the current world.  It's potential that Paul Veradittakit, partner at Pantera Capital, echoed in a statement:  ""The team’s vision for the future of finance is a level playing field in which all people can participate.

Pelosi has been in Congress since 1987 and is currently in her second tenure as Speaker of the House.  Touting her background in the STEM fields, Bacelar's claims the “once-bright future for crypto in America has been dimming” and “has suffered as federal intervention pushed innovators out of our district and the country.”  Specific cryptocurrency legislative goals are not listed on her campaigns website. However, she states that cryptocurrency is ""about building alternatives that do not exploit users and creating an ecosystem of innovation that better serves the American people.""  As such, Bacelar aims to enter Congress to push for ""informed, practical, and future-savvy"" regulation in the U.S.  In her campaign statement, she adds that that blockchain is ""key to building trustful live democracy tools,"" while crypto is ""essential for promoting human rights and a viable future.""  The candidate is also fundraising $1 million in cryptocurrency through the Coinbase exchange. As of now, her campaign has raised $5,000 in bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, litecoin, and USD Coin.  Political campaigns inclusion of cryptocurrency and blockchain planks are becoming more common as the industry grows.

42382783,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ssgF,1570014024,Bitcoin Price Risks Further Decline After Recovery Rally Stalls,"View  Bitcoin has cemented its third straight monthly loss after September 24 and 26 produced a large sell-off and dragged prices lower, opening up the possibility for another price drop.  Supposed bullish catalysts such as Bakkt's physically-backed bitcoin futures product fell short of expectations, possibly raising a red flag for institutional investors.  Both the weekly RSI and awesome oscillator demonstrate waning interest from bullish buyers leading to expectations of further price declines.  Bitcoin's (BTC) recent sell-offs on September 24 and 26 produced yet another bearish monthly closing candle, marking the third straight month in the red for the world's premier crypto.  The top crypto is currently changing hands at $8,234 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.17-percent decline over the last 24 hours. Further price drops are likely, should the bulls fail to reverse the damage done at the end of September.  Further, October has started poorly for traders looking to capture the rebound to $8,511 on Tuesday, as prices were swiftly rejected back below $8,300 at around 02:00 UTC this morning.    Monthly chart    The third straight monthly loss has opened the doors for further price declines.  BTC has begun to form a similar monthly pattern to the one produced from February to October, 2018, whereby prices are finding a solid base of support at around $7,780 amid sliding overall interest – as expressed by the lower highs and limited price range of the last 3 monthly candles.  There's hope that the sellers will become exhausted by the end of October's closing period, as total volume has been declining period-to-period. That theory will be put to the test in coming days, because volatility generally increases during the middle of the month (based on historical data).    Weekly chart    The weekly chart provides little in the way of a counter-narrative to the long-term bearish view seen on the monthly chart. Momentum has capped out beneath the neutral 50 zone on the RSI, a measurement of buyers and sellers of a particular asset over a particular time period.  Further, the awesome oscillator (AO), which also measures momentum and captures market cycles, demonstrates BTC's slow and steady decline in perceived value, with prices struggling to rise back above $9,000 post market sell-off.  Given the current weekly trajectory and limited price range, the bears look set to drive prices toward the 50-period moving average (yellow line at top of above chart) at $6,700, coinciding with the descending triangle's measured move, calculated from CoinDesk analysis conducted in early September.  Should prices rise back above $9,400 and then $9,800 (prior daily resistances), that would go a long way to reversing recent market developments and restoring investor confidence moving forward.

In the closed-door staff meeting – held soon after Calibra chief David Marcus responded to lawmakers at hearings in the U.S. – Zuckerberg acknowledged that Libra has elicited large amounts of public criticism. However, he added, it's been relatively straightforward behind closed doors.  ""The public things, I think, tend to be a little more dramatic,"" Zuckerberg said, according to The Verge, which published a transcript of the meeting on Tuesday. ""But a bigger part of it is private engagement with regulators around the world, and those, I think, often are more substantive and less dramatic.""  With illicit uses of Libra at the top of watchdogs' concerns, he moved on to talk about know-your-customer (KYC) verification for the new payment network, saying Calibra – the subsidiary developing a wallet app for Libra – and the Libra Association will have to do more to prove users' identities.  Zuckerberg said:  ""We already focus a lot on real identity, across especially Facebook, so there’s even more that we need to do in order to have this kind of a product.”  Echoing Libra co-creator David Marcus before Congress earlier the same month, Zuckerberg said money laundering and terrorism remain top issues to address. “There’s a lot of important issues that need to be dealt with in preventing money laundering, preventing financing of terrorists and people who the different governments say you can’t do business with,"" he said.

42382764,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ssJb,1570006812,Acquisition Marks Broadridge Financial's First Foray Into Crypto Services,"Broadridge Financial Solutions can soon offer post-trade services for cryptocurrency after acquiring fintech company Shadow Financial Systems.  The Lake Success, N.Y.-based company, an investor services firm with $4 billion in revenue and a $15 billion market cap, has invested heavily in blockchain projects, but the Shadow deal will be its foray into cryptocurrency.  Broadridge did not disclose the terms of the deal or reveal what parts of post-trade processing for crypto the firm would implement. According to Justin Llewellyn-Jones, head of capital markets for North America at Broadridge, over the next month, the firm will perform due diligence on Shadow Financial to determine what its software can do for crypto post-trade services.  “There are not that many [firms] that want to settle and clear Coinbase trades,” Llewellyn-Jones said. “If we have those capabilities it opens up an interesting arc for us to go forward.”  Shadow Financial is a provider of multi-asset-class solutions based in Piscataway, N.J. It offers post-trade software for exchanges, inter-dealer brokers, broker-dealers, agency brokers and proprietary trading firms. In August 2018, Shadow Financial announced its support of cryptocurrencies in ShadowSuite, the firm’s reconciliation, clearance, settlement, treasury and accounting system.  In addition to millions of dollars of investments in the blockchain space, Broadridge has participated in blockchain pilots focused on proxy voting and bilateral repurchase agreements. Still, this is the first Broadridge investment to dabble in cryptocurrency itself.  Earlier this year, Broadridge purchased Northern Trust’s blockchain platform for private equity. In response to the European Commission's amendment to its Shareholder’s Rights Directive, Broadridge announced that it was building a blockchain shareholder disclosure platform.

42382775,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ssXR,1570003227,Financial Services Giant Morningstar to Offer Ratings for Crypto Assets,"Morningstar Credit Ratings is planning an evaluation system for debt securities issued as tokens on a blockchain to make the emerging asset class more credible for investors.  The new rating services could enable a migration of the $117 trillion debt securities industry, which is administered and governed by custodians and trustees, to a decentralized financial network, Michael Brawer, chief operating officer at Morningstar Credit Ratings, said in a Forbes interview on Tuesday.  Billions of dollars investment would enter the crypto space as the new rating services can make the new asset class more credible, Brawer said.  The rating arm of Morningstar is looking to evaluate such cryptoassets as how it usually rates a traditional bond, but it will make the credit ratings as part of the blockchain.  Meanwhile, the rating agency also plans to launch a premium custom service that uses its internal modeling to help a client evaluate such investments.  According to the report, Morningstar’s system for rating bonds will be place directly on the Ethereum blockchain and eventually on other blockchains, through technology called an oracle.  The public ratings could be launched later this year whereas the premium service would come out by the end of 2020.  Brawer said:  “We're looking to see how we can also provide credit opinions, whether it’s a credit rating or different types of credit data and credit analytics that accompany those debt instruments, and we’re also looking to provide our services on a blockchain.”  Morningstar realized the demand for rating services in the crypto space when it was approached by a range of investors who issue and securitize debt securities, including small business loans and home equities on blockchain.  While the company’s rating services cover both government and corporate bonds, its blockchain products are still limited to structured debt instruments, the company said in the report.  Beside security and convenience, investors can directly connect lenders and borrowers, and eliminate custodians and trustees in a transaction saving as much as 500 basis points in fees.  Morningstar is still not sure if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will ask them to “enhance” their blockchain methodology.  “There's a very elaborate and intricate governance process which is all based on Dodd-Frank law and SEC regulations,” Brawer said in the report.  There are a few potential candidates that would partner with Morningstar to launch the inaugural product, including fintech startup Figure, alternative investment company Cadence and DeFi platform Polymath.

42382778,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ssYh,1569996010,Binance and Polychain Are Funding a Crypto-Friendly Bank in Malta,"To some, Malta-native Paula Pandolfino may seem like a walking contradiction: bitcoiner and banker.  After personally investing in bitcoin in 2016, she’s now co-founder of the upcoming Founders Bank in Malta, scheduled to open in 2020.  “Crypto will take over the world, and we need full banking services,” she told CoinDesk. “We want to be that pillar of banking for the ecosystem to support how it gets done. If anything, [we’re learning] how to wean off traditional banking and getting crypto to be that platform.”  Pandolfino said the bank raised $10 million so far and is looking to raise $30 million more in the near future. The bank’s leading investors include the crypto exchange Binance (also based in Malta), the hedge fund Polychain Capital and the Czech firm Carduus Asset Management.  Polychain president Joe Eagan told CoinDesk the investment was inspired by personal experience since his fund struggled to find banking partners in 2016. Today more institutions – from Silvergate Bank in California to Metropolitan Bank in New York to WEG Bank AG in Germany – serve the crypto industry. But Eagan said there’s still a dearth of providers open to crypto projects.  “Many of our portfolio projects, we’ve seen, still have difficulty accessing banking partners,” he said, adding:  “We need to bring in new users beyond the original users of bitcoin. And to do that we need to institutionalize the rails and structures of our space, adding services like institutional custody and banking support.”  In a press statement, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said his company will be one of the bank’s first clients as soon as it opens. Indeed, Pandolfino said that while her team is waiting for its European Union banking license, they are busy learning from their investors precisely what products and services the sector might need.  “Having Binance as a seed investor,” Pandolfino said, “has allowed us to build everything knowing what the pain points are for complex organizations within the crypto space and how to solve those problems.”  All of this poses the question of which bank shareholder will be the first to transition from crypto entrepreneur to bank chairman. For now, Pandolfino said European regulators are requiring board members have over a decade of experience in traditional finance.  “It seems to me like there will be some overlap between traditional banks and decentralized finance as the space continues to grow,” Eagan said.  Lessons learned  And yet, the road toward launching a crypto bank has been paved with challenges.  Originally, Founders Bank planned to raise capital with equity tokens. That plan was quickly shelved in order to avoid complications during the licensing process.  Pandolfino said the bank might explore compliant ways to work with tokens in the more distant future. After all, she was one of the advisors who contributed to Malta’s Virtual Financial Assets legislation. That process took more than a year. But it eventually created a European gateway, as Pandolfino put it, for compliant innovation in the crypto space.  “Our secret sauce is centered around building a know-your-customer, anti-money-laundering platform which is fintech-focused,” she said, describing Founders Bank.  TokenPay founder Derek Capo, whose startup is a WEG Bank AG shareholder, told CoinDesk he still believes his German bank will have first-mover advantage when it comes to serving European crypto companies.  “Today, [WEG Bank AG] is already operating and has corporate crypto clients with plans for business-to-customer services,” Capo said. “Things always take longer than expected.”  But Eagan said there are still too few crypto-friendly banks to worry about any single player dominating the regional market.  “We are proponents of regulation which will make our industry more successful in the long run,” Eagan said, adding:  “There is still more banking that will be needed as our space continues to grow and institutionalize.”  UPDATE (Oct. 2, 14:15 UTC): This article has been updated to remove mentions of Dr. Abdalla Kablan, current director of the Malta Stock Exchange, who was approached by the Founders Bank project but declined to join the bank's board.

Howard Surloff has joined the crypto firm as the first general counsel to join Blockchain’s executive team. Also on the executive team is the company’s president and chief legal officer, Marco Santori.  Surloff comes with a combined 25 years of executive experience at BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, according to a Blockchain press release.  While Surloff has spent his entire life in traditional finance, he believes he’s equipped to help blaze a trail in the crypto-regulatory frontier. “The verticals I worked in were essentially startups with each organization,” Surloff told CoinDesk in an email.  Surloff had held positions like deputy general counsel and global chief operating officer at BlackRock’s ETF arm, iShares. He also served on several of the firm’s key committees and helped navigate BlackRock through 13 acquisitions.  Before BlackRock, he oversaw the legal strategy and structure of more than 1,000 investment products as managing director and general counsel for Goldman Sachs. These included U.S. mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, derivatives and money market funds, among others.  Blockchain serves individuals and institutions and recently launched a crypto exchange with microsecond trading, called The PIT. The company raised more than $70 million from investors like Lightspeed Venture Partners and Google Ventures. Late last year it hired Springleaf Holding’s Macrina Kgil as chief financial officer.

The Journal says that few want to boost the project publicly – leaving Facebook to defend Libra by itself.

It was not immediately clear what the meeting will be about; the members are scheduled to discuss Libra's charter in mid-October.  David Marcus, the Facebook blockchain lead who co-created Libra, took to Twitter almost immediately defend the crypto project.  “We're very calmly, and confidently working through the legitimate concerns that Libra has raised by bringing conversations about the value of digital currencies to the forefront,"" he wrote, adding:  “Change of this magnitude is hard and requires courage + it will be a long journey.
