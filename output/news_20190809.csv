42382510,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rtvb,1565384456,New Jersey Signs Blockchain Task Force Program Into Law,"Blockchain implementation research is coming to New Jersey.  Governor Phil Murphy signed bill S2297, the Blockchain Initiative Task Force, into law Friday. The task force is commissioned with studying potential use-cases for blockchain technology on the state and local level. The bill specifically points out medical records, land records, banking, and property auctions as potential applications.  First drafted in March 2018, the bill passed the New Jersey Senate with one nay and the assembly unanimously.  Consisting of 14 appointed members, the task force has 180 days to file a study to the governor's office and the state’s committee on science, tech, and innovation.  State-level interest in blockchain technology has increased over the past two years, particularly due to cybersecurity threats. For example, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) was hit by a ransomware case in November 2018. With some 400 servers affected and the infrastructure frozen, Gov. John Hickenlooper called the first-ever state cybersecurity tech emergency.  State officials often find data compromises a large issue. With multiple entities in government needing access to data files, state-level IT departments are looking for a secure way to share information.  Recently speaking with CoinDesk, Colorado’s IT department says blockchain technology could be a potential solution to cybersecurity problems such as the recent ransomware attack.

Clain.io, a Luxembourg-cryptocurrency capital flows research team, says the 7,074 stolen coins are being laundered through mixing service Chipmixer. Clain says at least 4,836 bitcoins were laundered since June 12.  A bitcoin tumbling service mixes bitcoins with other users' coins. Since bitcoins are attached to the publicly verifiable blockchain, mixing services are used to obfuscate transaction histories that follow bitcoins around.  Chipmixer was overwhelmed with the funds, Clain states. From June 12 onward, the hacker dumped funds into the mixer with abandon.  ""It was pretty straightforward to trace the hacker's subsequent steps as it is practically impossible to launder big volume of coins in a relatively short period of time. Thus, we were able to detect the initial pool of hacker's addresses,"" the company wrote.  Clain says that Chipmixer has never handled inflows of such high volume, leading them to conclude that most funds coming out of Chipmixer today are related to one owner, the Binance hacker.  Image via Clain.io  Address analysis shows the hacker further breaking his loot into smaller sums of around 10 coins. Breaking the lump sum into small mixed batches is one way to prepare for off-ramping cryptocurrencies into fiat. Clain says 150 clusters were detected during the active mixing period and further believes some 5,300 bitcoin have been clustered overall.  Of the 4,836 coins tumbled, Clain has identified 183 bitcoins from the hacker with another 814 very likely to be from the hacker.  Clain's analysis shows little evidence to indicate any of the coins have hit the open market.

The company also proposed two new tokens in the design of the platform.  According to the report, SK Corporation C&C, the group's IT arm, made the announcement today at a conference on the blockchain and social impact. Kakao's Ground X was one of the sponsors of the conference, which was held at the Heyground co-working space in Seongdong District, Seoul.  The platform will be built with xCurrent, a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system from San Francisco-based Ripple. Once completed, the platform will allow for direct, low-cost and peer-to-peer (P2P) foreign-currency transactions, instantly settling free of intermediary institutions.  The architecture will be open sourced and open to outside developers, with transaction terms customized by the counterparties. It will be centralized and will not depend on mining.  Two separate tokens will be utilized. The Social Value Coin (SVC) will trade 1:1 to the won and be used for making the actual donations. The Social Value Power (SVP) will be distributed as compensation to those using the platform. SVPs will be paid out at a ratio of 1 to 1000 SVCs when donations are made, meaning the sender receives 1 SVP for every 1,000 SVCs remitted.  SK said that the project is still in development with no firm deadline for launch.  The group has been active in the development of blockchain solutions. In late 2018, SK Corporation C&C signed a deal with New York-based ConsenSys to build an enterprise blockchain platform. Last month, it was reported that the SK Holdings invested 10 billion won ($8.2 million) in a fund managed by ConsenSys.  SK Telecom, the telecommunications arm of the group, is building the STONledger, an enterprise blockchain platform. It is also working with a number of other companies, including Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and Koscom—the IT subsidiary of the Korea Exchange—to develop a blockchain-based identification system.  SK is the third largest chaebol in the country, after Samsung and Hyundai Motor, with 218 trillion won in assets. The modest blockchain-based donation project being proposed is just about all that is possible at the moment in terms of cryptocurrencies. With ICOs banned, tokens that represent underlying fiat currencies and those used for highly-directed rewards programs are all that can be developed while still remaining within the regulations.

According to a Medium post published August 9, Binance US -- a “tailor-made platform to access cryptocurrencies in the United States"" -- has adopted a Digital Asset Risk Assessment Framework to meet compliance requirements of the country.  This follows a move by the Malta-based exchange to deny U.S. citizens access to its primary trading platform in June, a day after announcing a partnership with BAM Trading Services to formally enter the U.S. market.  The company writes:  “Binance US strives to be a reliable and efficient marketplace for a rich selection of high-quality digital assets, so that our users can be part of the open and competitive market that discovers projects with true utility.”  To that end, the company also announced it is examining 30 crypto assets to launch on its U.S. platform. These include the top market cap cryptos like BTC, ETH, and LTC, as well as its own BNB token, among others.  As previously reported, BAM Trading Services will operate the U.S. platform, which is overlaid on Binance's wallet and matching engine technologies. The exchange aims to bolster its compliance and security practices through partnerships with the software provider Chainalysis and KYC/AML tool provider IdentityMind.

This announcement comes in light of Ripple’s Q2 report, which detailed the company’s total sales of its native token XRP increasing by nearly 48 percent to $251 million. This growth was driven primarily by a strong uptick in institutional sales.  In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO, said: “We’re in a very strong position, our business is growing strongly, we have a strong balance sheet, and I intend to press our advantage.”  Additionally, Ripple’s 10 percent equity stake in MoneyGram appears to have paid off. Last week the remittance company announced it began using Ripple’s xRapid transaction product to maintain liquidity when making international transfers.  According to Garlinghouse, MoneyGram integrated Ripple’s tech with its US dollar to Mexican peso and US dollar to Philippine peso pairings, and will “ramp” up the service heading into 2020.  Garlinghouse did not speak specifically about which companies or industries Ripple is targeting, but mentioned Ripple maintains an option to invest a further $20 million in MoneyGram at its original purchase price.  “Anything we can do to accelerate our growth and give us more capabilities that serve customer needs is a good place to be,"" he said. “We’re probably the largest investor in blockchain and crypto on the planet. We’ve publicly announced we’ve made about $500m [of investments] in the space over the last 18 months.”  In the past, Ripple has advanced the use cases of its native currency XRP by integrating with firms. Over the first two quarters of 2019, the company released 1.6 billion XRP from escrow to develop projects on RippleNet.

Serial entrepreneur Jeremy Gardner, the 27-year-old co-founder of Augur and the Blockchain Education Network, is taking on Hollywood with a self-funded YouTube series called the “Crypto Castle Chronicles.”  Produced by Adrian Baschhttps://www.filmgate.miami/adrian-baschuk, formerly of Vice and now a contributing producer on the CNBC Africa ""Crypto Trader"" show hosted by Ran NeuNer, “Crypto Castle Chronicles” is being shopped around to television networks, Gardner said.  “It offers real insight into entrepreneurship, startups, and fundraising, from a perspective that isn’t like Shark Tank,” he told CoinDesk. “We’re speaking to executive producers at some of the networks.”  Gardner is perhaps best known as the main tenant of the “Crypto Castles,” an apartment in San Francisco and a mansion in Miami where blockchain industry heavyweights often sublet and party.  The New York Times referred to Garnder as the “king” of these testosterone-soaked dwellings in a 2018 article about early bitcoin adopters getting “hilariously rich.” A followup feature by Breaker displayed a pantry full of liquor and Star Wars toys in San Francisco, plus bikini-clad models at the Miami pad.  It's educational  These days, Gardner is trying to raise money for his new lifestyle brand MadeMan, starting with skincare products. A film crew followed him around for two weeks as he pursued a Series A round, resulting in a dozen 10-minute episodes that begin airing on YouTube next week.  “There’s never been educational reality TV,” Gardner told CoinDesk, claiming he’s turned down “a dozen” offers to make a reality program about his life before filming his own show, his way.  Along the way, Gardner interviews early bitcoin investors like Morgan Creek Digital’s Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano and token guru Ian Balina. Gardner said his goal for the show is to educate the masses about cryptocurrency through following his personal journey.  Although so far the show doesn’t include any explainers, technical deep dives, or examples of him actually using bitcoin, he added he plans to film bonus explainers with one of his portfolio companies and eventually transact with bitcoin on the show.  “If you look at the two most powerful people in America, it’s probably Donald Trump and the Kardashians. How did they build their power base? Reality TV,” Gardner said, nevertheless insisting this series isn’t motivated by a desire for fame or fortune.  “It’s a real mechanism for providing thoughtful entertainment for the masses in a way they feel most comfortable digesting,” he said.

We have added the task force's comment below.      Fifteen nations are planning to set up a system to monitor cryptocurrency transactions, a Friday report indicates.  According to Nikkei Asian Review, the aim is to stem the movement of funds for illicit purposes, such as money laundering and funding of terrorism, by collecting and sharing transaction data, as well as the personal information of cryptocurrency users.  FATF, the international money-laundering watchdog, is claimed in the report to be managing the project, which is slated to be finalized by next year and live within several years. The 15 nations, including the G7 members, Australia and Singapore, would develop the system, says Nikkei.  However, FATF told CoinDesk after publication of this article that it is not, in fact, involved in the monitoring project. It stated via email:  ""The updated FATF standards announced in June will require crypto-exchanges in all jurisdictions to identify their customers and keep that information securely and privately, so that it is available to law enforcement authorities when needed to investigate money laundering or terrorist financing. The same requirement already applies to banks and other financial institutions. The FATF does not collect customer data, and the FATF standards recognise the importance of privacy and data protection.""  The G7 group of nations warned in July that cryptocurrencies like Facebook’s Libra are a threat to global financial stability, and that that rules of the “highest” standards are needed to minimize the use of digital currencies in money laundering and funding terrorism.  FATF was also reported last month to have given its permission for Japan to lead the creation of an international cryptocurrency payments network similar to banking network SWIFT, also aimed to stem money laundering.

Essentially, BTC has charted lower highs above $12,000 since Tuesday. At the same time, it has created higher lows in the last three days. That narrowing price range is a sign of indecision in the market place.  The consolidation could also be considered a sign of bullish exhaustion since it comes following a 35 percent price rise over eight days, as seen in the chart below.  6-hour chart  Bitcoin picked up a bid near $9,100 and rose to a one-month high of $12,325 on Tuesday. Since then, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a contracting price range, as represented by trendlines connecting lower highs and higher lows.  A break above $12,000 would confirm range breakout and pave way for a move toward $13,000.  BTC, however, could fall back to the former resistance-turned-support of $11,120 if the range is breached to the downside.  The relative strength index is reporting an inverse head-and-shoulders breakdown, a bearish reversal pattern. As a result, a range breakdown looks likely.  Daily chart  Bitcoin revived the bull market with a falling channel breakout on Wednesday. So far, however, the follow-through has been anything but bullish.  The cryptocurrency created a dragonfly doji yesterday, which occurs when the market trades down and then reverses to close largely unchanged on the day.  That candlestick pattern is widely considered an early warning of bearish reversal.  The daily chart also shows a ""double inside bar pattern"" – yesterday's doji falls within Wednesday's high and low and Wednesday's candle is engulfed by Tuesday's high and low.  Double inside bars indicate consolidation and lack of volatility. Trading volumes have also dropped over the last two days.  The pattern often paves the way for an explosive move on either side. A break above the high of the first inside bar is considered a sign of bullish breakout and a move below the low of the first inside bar’s low is taken as a bearish reversal signal.  So, the focus is on Wednesday's high and low of $12,145 and $11,388.  A UTC close above $12,145 would signal a resumption of the rally from recent lows near $9,100 and open the doors to the bearish lower high of $13,200 created on July 10.  A UTC close below $11,388 would confirm the bearish reversal and shift risk in favor of a drop to $9,057 (July 17 low).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42382508,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rtpJ,1565344822,This Bank Gave Bitcoin to Its Entire Staff. Now It's Taking Crypto Clients,"A small bank in New York City has started doing business with cryptocurrency firms, joining the very short list of U.S. financial institutions to embrace the sector.  Quontic Bank opened a checking account for a bitcoin ATM company a few weeks ago and is in the process of completing a contract to deliver banking services to another crypto startup. The bank wouldn't name either client.  “We’re just taking steps so that when the regulatory environment becomes more crypto-friendly, we don’t have a lot of catching up to do,” said Quontic chief executive Steven Schnall, who acquired the bank in 2009. “We’re looking to diversify our product offering and our customer mix by entering into that field.”  While Schnall wouldn't say how big he wants Quontic's crypto business to be, he claimed the pending contract ""could impact millions of Americans.""  Crypto-friendly banks are extremely rare, in part because of the extra work they have to do complying with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.  ""Banks and other financial institutions have to look out for any suspicious activity,"" said Joshua Klayman, head of the blockchain and digital assets practice at law firm Linklaters. ""If you have a startup that raised money doing an ICO and didn't do proper KYC or AML, that bank doesn't know who the proceeds are from.""  The handful of U.S. banks willing to serve the sector includes Silvergate in California and Signature and Metropolitan Commercial in New York.  Like those institutions, Quontic is a relative pipsqueak in the banking industry. With $420 million in assets, it is only 0.015 percent the size of JPMorgan.  Yet Quontic stands out because its leaders caught the crypto bug early on.  Students of crypto  Schnall, a longtime mortgage lender, became interested in bitcoin when it was worth less than $1, bought his first bitcoin at $75 in 2013 and lost 500 BTC in the Mt Gox debacle.  Patrick Sells, now the bank’s chief innovation officer, said Schnall began to educate him on bitcoin the first few times they met, while Sells was doing mortgage lead generation for Quontic through his own firm.  To learn more about the mechanics of cryptocurrency, Schnall and Sells built an ethereum mining operation, independent from Quontic, in January 2018. (Schnall said he is now more bullish on bitcoin than any other cryptocurrency.)  The two executives even came close to launching their own cryptocurrency, also separate from the bank, called QCoin. They lined up $2.5 million for an initial coin offering (ICO) but called it off after the market crashed.  Undeterred by the ups and downs, the bankers said that they believe banking and crypto can have a symbiotic relationship and are exploring what steps toward that goal might look like under the U.S. regulatory framework.  The bankers helped educate their staff of 180 by giving them each $20 in bitcoin when the price of bitcoin was around $3,000, and they’re looking to hire employees with experience in cryptocurrency.  “We can teach them the banking side,” said Sells, vaping in a white v-neck and jeans at Quontic's Manhattan headquarters. “It’s easier to do that than vice versa.”  Highly selective  While the bank wants to let cryptocurrency companies know that it’s open to banking them, Quontic said it has high standards for crypto customers.  When the bitcoin ATM network approached Quontic a year ago, the company was not prepared for the bank's compliance vetting.  It didn’t have a disaster recovery plan, it was not properly tracking the currency transaction reports (CTRs) filed to regulators, and the company’s reporting was not up to Quontic’s standards.  After working closely with the bank for a year, the company opened an account at Quontic a few weeks ago.  To Schnall, such professionalism is necessary for crypto startups to be taken seriously.  “You don’t have mom-and-pop financial institutions. You’re not going to have mom-and-pop crypto players of any significance,” Schnall said. “Crypto companies have to have strong controls, internal audit, and a very robust system of compliance.""  Additionally, the juice has to be worth the squeeze for Quontic to bank a crypto firm.  ""There must also be a strong strategic motivation for us as well – such as meaningful deposit balances, etc."" Schnall said. ""'Meaningful' is relative to how complex, risk-laden and labor-intensive the account will be.""

42382504,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rtmn,1565341278,Coinbase Sets Out How It Foiled a 'Sophisticated' Hacking Attack,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has described how it was targeted by, and foiled, ""a sophisticated, highly targeted, thought out attack"" aimed to access its systems and presumably to make off with some of the billions of dollars'-worth of cryptocurrency it holds.  In an Aug. 8 blog post that sets out in technical detail how the plot unfolded and how the exchange countered the attempted theft, Coinbase said the hackers used a combination of means to try and hoodwink staff and access vital systems – methods that included spear phishing, social engineering and browser zero-day exploits.  The attack had started on May 30, with a dozen staff being sent emails that purported to be from Gregory Harris, a Research Grants Administrator at the University of Cambridge. Far from random, these cited the employees' past histories and requested help with judging projects competing for an award.  Coinbase said:  ""This email came from the legitimate Cambridge domain, contained no malicious elements, passed spam detection, and referenced the backgrounds of the recipients. Over the next couple weeks, similar emails were received. Nothing seemed amiss.""  The attackers developed email conversations with several staffers, holding back from sending any malicious code until June 17, when ""Harris"" sent another email, containing a URL that, when opened in Firefox, would install malware capable of taking over someone’s machine.  Coinbase said that, ""within a matter of hours, Coinbase Security detected and blocked the attack.""  The first stage of the attack, the post indicates, first identified the OS and browser on the intended victims' machines, displaying a ""convincing error"" to macOS users who were not using the Firefox browser, and prompting them to install the latest version of the app.  Once the emailed URL was visited with Firefox, the exploit code was delivered from a different domain, that had been registered on May 28. It was at this point that the attack was identified, ""based on both a report from an employee and automated alerts,"" Coinbase said.  Its analysis found that stage two would have seen another malicious payload delivered in the form of a variant of the Mac-targeting backdoor malware called Mokes.  Coinbase explained that there had been two separate Firefox zero-day exploits utilized in the attack: ""one that allowed an attacker to escalate privileges from JavaScript on a page to the browser (CVE-2019–11707) and one that allowed the attacker to escape the browser sandbox and execute code on the host computer (CVE-2019–11708).""  Notably, the former was discovered by Samuel Groß of Google’s Project Zero at the same time as the attacker, though Coinbase played down the likelihood that the hacking team had gained the information on the vulnerability via that source. Groß addresses that in a Twitter thread.  In another sign of the sophistication of the hacking team – labeled by Coinbase as CRYPTO-3 or HYDSEVEN – it took over or created two email accounts and created a landing page at the University of Cambridge.  Coinbase said:  ""We don’t know when the attackers first gained access to the Cambridge accounts, or whether the accounts were taken over or created. As others have noted, the identities associated with the email accounts have almost no online presence and the LinkedIn profiles are almost certainly fake.""  After discovering the single affected computer at the company, Coinbase said it revoked all credentials on the machine, and locked all the staffer's accounts.  ""Once we were comfortable that we had achieved containment in our environment, we reached out to the Mozilla security team and shared the exploit code used in this attack,"" the exchange said. ""The Mozilla security team was highly responsive and was able to have a patch out for CVE-2019–11707 by the next day and CVE-2019–11708 in the same week.""  Coinbase also contacted Cambridge University to report and help fix the issue, as well as to gain more information on the attacker’s methods.  Coinbase concluded:  ""The cryptocurrency industry has to expect attacks of this sophistication to continue, and by building infrastructure with excellent defensive posture, and working with each other to share information about the attacks we’re seeing, we’ll be able to defend ourselves and our customers, support the cryptoeconomy, and build the open financial system of the future.""

Bloomberg Law reports Friday that a number of sources have said Amir Zaidi, director of the CFTC's Division of Market Oversight (DMO), is to leave the regulator within weeks.  Zaidi had been in the post since early in 2017 and was the official responsible for setting policy on bitcoin futures trading and redrafting the rules on OTC swaps markets.  Before joining the CFTC in 2010, Zaidi was an associate in the Corporate and Securities Group at international law firm Arnold and Porter LLP. Previously, he'd also held financial analyst roles at Goldman Sachs and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Vincent McGonagle, the CFTC's current deputy director of Enforcement will likely serve as acting DMO director after Zaidi's departure, a Bloomberg Law source said. McGonagle had served as DMO director until Zaidi took over the role.  The news comes just a week after it was announced that the director of the CFTC's experimental fintech initiative will step down.  According to a statement released Aug. 2, LabCFTC’s director and chief innovation officer, Daniel Gorfine, will leave his post to pursue a job in the private sector.  In his two years with the agency, Gorfine spearheaded the LabCFTC project, released educational materials on virtual currencies and launched an accelerator program to trial internal blockchain applications.

42382487,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rr9F,1565315735,Blockstream Launches Bitcoin Mining Farm With Fidelity as Early Customer,"Blockstream has launched a colocation mining service and already counts the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman as customers.  On Thursday, the bitcoin and blockchain technology firm announced a new mining wing, Blockstream Mining, along with a BetterHash-based mining pool, Blockstream Pool. Led by cryptographer Dr. Adam Back, Blockstream is best known for its bitcoin-sidechain ecosystem, the Liquid Network.  Blockstream Mining will host colocation services across North America with its most recent installation in Georgia. The announcement stated that 300 megawatts, or 300,000 kilowatt-hours of energy, will be made available to customers.  That level of energy supply would be able to power up around 100,000 more-advanced ASIC mining models such as MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M20S or Bitmain’s AntMiner S17 Pro.  These machines on average have an electricity consumption of about 3 kWh per unit with a hashing power of around 55 terahashes per second. That could add about six exhashes per second to bitcoin network’s computing power (1 exhash = 1 million terahash).  Blockstream says its self-mining efforts currently make up one percent of the global bitcoin hash rate. The future relationship between Blockstream’s self-mining and Blockstream Mining was not specified.  Blockstream CSO Samson Mow says the firm's mining efforts, even before the latest launch, were largely based on concerns about the network’s future:  “We began self-mining back in 2017 after being motivated by widespread concern that mining decentralization was declining. At the time it appeared that parties involved in ASIC manufacture, hosting, and pool operations were becoming a centralizing force and holding back Bitcoin from reaching its full potential. We figured we could use our Bitcoin expertise to improve the situation.”  In this vein, Blockstream also announced the launch of Blockstream Pool running the BetterHash mining protocol. Introduced in 2014 by Blocskstream project OpenHash, BetterHash decentralizes mining pool decisions, such as which block to mine, to individual owners. Proponents argue it further decentralizes and democratizes bitcoin mining.  Blockstream Pool is the graduate of a one-year testnet and is available to Blockstream Mining customers. As of now, Blockstream Mining is exclusive to enterprises and institutions.

Winding Tree, a decentralized business-to-business marketplace built on ethereum, will provide logistical support for Etihad Airways’ distribution system, according to a Reuters report on Thursday.  The move will allow the airline to bypass third-party operators that currently manage its inventories – such as flight times, travel itineraries, and baggage tracking. Tristan Thomas, Etihad's director of digital and innovation, told Reuters these third parties often provide an overpriced service.  Pedro Anderson, Winding Tree's chief operating officer, redoubled that claim and told Reuters:  ""We have been doing experiments and new solutions on the platform. Ultimately, that benefits the consumer. When there's innovation, you start to have disruption, you have competition which results in better prices for the consumer.""  ""Very few have chosen to disrupt the distribution world and that's because those are major players with very significant margins that have acted to keep that kind of a closed shop,"" said Thomas  In fact, Winding Tree provides real-time information systems for a number of airlines, hotels, and tourism offices around the world.  In 2017, the firm partnered with Lufthansa to develop a blockchain-based travel marketplace powered by a cryptographic token. Months later, Russian airline S7 revealed it was using the distributed ledger to issue air tickets. AirFrance also combined its APIs to oversee its airline management systems.  With its wide birth and ability to manage a vast array of data, Winding Tree counts not only global distribution systems run by entrenched firms like Amadeus and Sabre, but also consumer facing websites like Expedia and Booking.com as competitors.
