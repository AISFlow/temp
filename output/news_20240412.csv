25640830,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602960,1712962800,PEPE Preparing For A 54% Move? Analyst Thinks So,"An analyst has explained how a PEPE daily close outside of a certain price range could lead its value to go on a rally of 54%. PEPE Symmetrical Triangle May Hint At The Next Move For The Memecoin In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed the recent trend forming in the PEPE price. According to the analyst, the memecoin is currently forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on its one-day chart. The “symmetrical triangle” here refers to a pattern in technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, looks like a triangle. In this pattern, there are two lines of interest between which the asset’s price consolidates for a period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back Above $70,000 Despite Negative Taker Volume The upper line connects successive tops, while the lower one joins together bottoms. The main feature of the pattern is that these two lines approach each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope (hence the “symmetrical” in the name). There are other triangle patterns in TA, but those have either differently angled lines (as is the case with wedges) or one line parallel to the time-axis (ascending and descending triangles). Like other TA patterns that represent a consolidation phase, the lines of the symmetrical triangle also serve as a point of potential reversal for the price. The upper line usually offers resistance (meaning tops can occur), while the lower line may provide support (bottom formation). When a break takes place from either of these lines, the price may likely see sustained momentum in that direction. This implies that a break above the triangle could be a bullish signal, while one below may be bearish. The symmetrical triangle may be viewed as a phase of the market in which the bulls and bears are at a standstill, hence why the price is ranging sideways. During a break, one of these wins out, and price action follows in that direction. Naturally, as the lines converge towards a center point in this pattern, a breakout becomes increasingly probable the closer to the apex of the triangle the asset’s price gets. Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that highlights the symmetrical triangle pattern that PEPE has been trading inside recently: Looks like the asset's price is getting closer to the converging point of the pattern | Source: @ali_charts on X As is visible in the graph, the 1-day price of PEPE has been approaching the triangle’s apex recently, implying that a break in a direction may be coming for the memecoin.

Given the pattern that has been forming, it now remains to be seen how the asset’s price will play out from here. PEPE Price At the time of writing, PEPE is trading around $0.000006868072, up 3% over the past week.

25635876,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602928,1712955625,"Will The Halving Send Bitcoin Price To $100,000? Analytics Platform Reveals What You Should Expect","Hannah Phung, a lead analyst at on-chain analytics platform SpotOnChain, recently gave her opinion on the impact that Bitcoin Halving could have on the flaghsip crypto’s price. This adds to the ongoing debate on whether or not the Halving event could cause Bitcoin’s price to rise to $100,000. Bitcoin’s Price Surge Might Not Come Immediately Phung mentioned during an interview with BeInCrypto that Bitcoin’s price tends to increase around 6 to 12 months after the Halving and not immediately. This is evident from the past Halving events, as Bitcoin’s significant price gains came about one year after the Halving had occurred. After the first Halving on November 28, 2021, Bitcoin saw a price increase of over 8,000% one year after the event. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Price Will Reach $0.0001 If This Happens Source: Milk Road Meanwhile, BTC saw a price increase of 284% and 559% one year after the second and third Halving events, which took place on July 9, 2016, and May 11, 2020, respectively. Phung further noted that Bitcoin’s price gains come from the reduction in Bitcoin miners’ supply, which helps increase scarcity and drive up its price, especially when demand is stable. In February, NewsBTC reported that Bitcoin’s demand was far outpacing the miners’ supply. This led to several crypto analysts making bullish predictions that Bitcoin’s price could increase exponentially when miners’ rewards are further cut in half later this month. One such analyst was MacronautBTC, who raised the possibility of Bitcoin rising to $237,000. This Bitcoin Halving Could Be Different Despite the crypto market being known to follow historical patterns, Phung emphasized that the market can also be unpredictable, opening the possibility of this Halving being different from past ones. Moreover, this cycle has already proven different, considering that for the first time, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH) before the Halving. Furthermore, the analyst acknowledged that the Bitcoin market is “much larger and more established compared to earlier halvings.” However, Phung still expects a price increase after the halving, although she admitted that the exact timing is uncertain, meaning it could be earlier or even later than usual. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also echoed a similar sentiment about how things could be different this cycle when he shared his analysis of the five phases of the Bitcoin Halving. Specifically, he stated that the Re-accumulation phase “may not last very long before additional uptrend continuation” since this is the first time the Re-accumulation range will be around a new ATH. Market Sentiment Could Determine Bitcoin’s Price Post-Halving Phung also elaborated on how the market sentiment after the halving could provide insights into Bitcoin’s future trajectory. She predicts that crypto investors will likely be bullish once the halving takes place, considering the significance of the event on Bitcoin’s supply. Related Reading: The Era Of Flippenings: Can Dogecoin Take XRP’s Spot? However, once the excitement about the halving wears off, several metrics, such as price charts, trading volume, social media discussions, and on-chain data like active addresses or exchange supply, will need to be analyzed to determine whether or not investors are still bullish. Meanwhile, Phung suggested that the price surge that occurs immediately after the Bitcoin halving may not be shortlived this time around since more institutional investors are now involved and have helped create a “more mature market.” BTC price rises to $70,700 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Bitcoin News, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving-price-100000/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

This achievement represents approximately 62.5% of all LTC addresses with a balance, underscoring Litecoin’s widespread adoption and long-term viability within the crypto community. Rising Long-Term Holder Trend Signals Optimism The surge in long-term holders has been particularly noticeable in recent months, underscoring a growing inclination towards holding LTC for quite a long time. In February’s closing days alone, the number of long-term holders soared by 170,000, signaling robust investor confidence in Litecoin’s long-term prospects. Related Reading: From $90 To $400 Litecoin: Analysts Bullish On LTC Soaring Trajectory In tandem with this surge in long-term holders, the number of individuals holding LTC for more than a year has steadily risen, now totaling 2.54 million addresses.

In contrast, approximately 26.8% of LTC holders, totaling 2.15 million addresses, are currently at a loss. Meanwhile, a smaller segment, constituting 5.53% of holders, is situated at breakeven, which means they are neither in a loss nor a profit. Bullish Sentiment Surrounds Litecoin Amidst Rumors of ETF Approval So far, Litecoin has seen relatively stable movement, experiencing a minor increase of 0.3% over the past week, followed by a slight downturn of 0.1% in the last 24 hours. As of the current writing, LTC is trading at $96.72. Despite the altcoin’s current stability in price, analysts such as World of Charts anticipate a potential surge in the coming months, with projections suggesting a climb to $400. This bullish momentum is fuelled by growing institutional interest, particularly surrounding rumors of a potential LTC Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett has hinted at institutional intrigue towards a Litecoin ETF, citing LTC’s functional similarities to Bitcoin as a potential factor in its approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 🚨SCOOP (with fixed ticker) 🙂: Hearing rumblings on the institutional level about possible interest in a Litecoin ETF.

In fast downward afternoon action during U.S. trading, bitcoin {{BTC}} plunged below $66,000 after having challenged the $71,000 level just hours earlier. At press time, bitcoin had bounced back to $66,700, down more than 5% over the past 24 hours.  Ether {{ETH}}, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell as much as 12% to $3,100 before a modest bounce cut the decline to 8%.  Smaller cryptos suffered even heavier losses in the panicky action. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) dropped nearly 10%, with Cardano's ADA, Avalanche's AVAX, bitcoin cash {{BCH}}, filecoin {{FIL}} and aptos {{APT}} plummeting 15-20%.  The drawdown triggered the largest leverage washout in a month, liquidating some $850 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all digital assets, CoinGlass data shows. Some $770 million of those positions were longs betting on rising prices, caught off-guard by the sudden decline.  The dip occurred as stock markets sank during the U.S trading session amid rising fears of broadening conflict in the Middle East, as U.S. authorities warned that Iran could prepare to launch a significant attack on Israel.  Treasury bonds and the U.S. dollar index (DXY) surged as traders flocked to hedges, while key U.S. equity indices the S&P500 and Nasdaq 100 slipped 1.7% an hour ahead of the close of the trading session.

As prices recover momentum, traders and analysts suggest a brighter future might be around the corner. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Go ‘Ballistic’ After Halving, Says Top Analyst – Here’s Why Altcoins Next Stop: Altseason? On Friday, some traders shared optimistic forecasts for altcoins. According to investor Crypto Jelle, the altcoin market cap chart “looks primed to go on a massive rally in the coming months.” The investor highlights the similarities between the altcoin’s performance during the previous bull runs. Per the chart, after 2018’s all-time high (ATH) of $474.5 billion, the altcoin market consolidated under the resistance zone in “preparation” for the next bull run.

Source: CryptoJelle on X During the 2020-2021 bull market, altcoins’ market cap broke out and consolidated around a new support zone before continuing its upward trajectory to its last ATH of $1.7 trillion. As the investor highlighted, altcoins’ performance looks like that of the previous bull run. They are seemingly consolidating after a breakout from the resistance zone. If history were to repeat itself, then altcoins could “remind everyone what they’re capable of.” Another trader and analyst, Titan of Crypto, shared a similar prediction to Jelle’s. According to the analysts, he’s seen crypto community members believing that “there’ll never be another altseason.” To those in doubt, the trader suggests they “zoom out” to get a broader perspective on where the market is in the cycle. Per his chart, which excludes Ether (ETH), altcoins are at the “2 bullish monthly candles followed by consolidation” phase. Run up prediction for altcoins, excluding ETH. Source: Titan Of Crypto on X. The chart also suggests that the subsequent run-up could surpass the $1.13 trillion ATH and soar to a market cap of $3.25 trillion in the coming months.

Across different platforms, the sentiment seems to lean towards “negative” despite the optimistic forecasts. Follis, content creator and founder of Chroma Trading shared his experience on X this Thursday.

Follis suggested a combination of “over-leveraged top longers” and “traders who expected price to go up indefinitely.” Another user weighed in, suggesting traders lost significant money buying high and selling low on Solana and Base memecoins. Top crypto trader Ansem joined the discussion, disagreeing with the “depressing” take on the current market. The trader pointed out that BTC was at $70,000 and ETH at $3,500 at the time of his post. These prices represent a 129.8% and 82.5% increase in the past year. Similarly, he highlighted the performance of SOL compared to the bear market bottom and the remarkable performance of memecoins in the past six months. Many users agreed that drawdowns are usual during market cycles and ultimately suggested looking at the bigger picture.

42408474,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJGhh,1712947199,Why Bitcoin Halving Calculators Are Out of Sync,"The Bitcoin network halving is fast approaching, likely to fall in seven days (April 19), according to the most recent estimates. But trying to pin down the exact minute or even hour for this pre-planned, programmatic update is surprisingly unpredictable. Just take a look at any of the Bitcoin halving countdowns online: they’re all out of sync!  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Watcher Guru, for instance, shows the halving will strike in seven days, seven hours and 20 minutes, while CoinMarketCap says it will happen two hours later. The “Bitcoin Block Reward Halving Countdown” says it’ll be in seven days and 15 hours. While these estimations are all generally aligned, for someone looking to trade on the halving may be a bit frustrated.  The Bitcoin halving is scheduled to occur every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. This particular event will be executed automatically by the network at exactly blockheight 840,000. Based on the way Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto designed the system, bitcoin miners “find” the next block to hash to the blockchain every 10 minutes, meaning it should be easy to figure out precisely when the next halving should happen down to the minute.  In practice, however, things are a bit messier.  “Calculating the time to bitcoin halving has three important elements: The current block height, the block at which the next halving occurs and the average block time,” according to Simon Cousaert, director of data at The Block Research (which currently predicts the halving will fall in seven days, 15 hours and 40 minutes).  “Since the second element, the target block, is a constant, the accuracy of the countdown depends on the current block height and the average block time,” he said. Likewise for counting the current block height, which should be easy data to fetch.  Where the discrepancy likely comes in is how different halving calculators are counting the time between blocks. Again, theoretically the time to mine a block should be even 10 minutes, by design. But the amount of miners directing computational power to mine and secure the Bitcoin blockchain is not static, meaning that that figure can fluctuate.  See also The Bitcoin Halving Really Is Different This Time | Opinion  “The average block time is harder to estimate accurately,” Cousaert said. “One can take a simple constant, and assume that every block takes 10 minutes to be mined.” But what halving calculators are likely doing is taking “the rolling average block time” over some time scale, whether it’s over the past 100, 90 or 30 days (or any other arbitrary period of time).  “This does not necessarily lead to a more accurate prediction, because the average of the last days does not necessarily predict the average for the next few days,” Cousaert added.  NiceHash lead mining manager Marko Tarman echoed this point saying that everyone in the world has the same access to some “static” data regarding Bitcoin: the halving block height. However, there are two other “dynamic pieces of information,” the current block height and block time.  “It's important to note that block times can fluctuate considerably,” Taman said. “If the average block times are shorter than 10 minutes, the predicted halving event will appear to be sooner. Conversely, if the average block times exceed 10 minutes, the halving event will seem to be delayed.”  In other words, counting down to the halving — an event not only known in advance, but actively anticipated to the point that people argue over whether it is “priced in” — is more of an art than a science.  “While this detail may not be critical when observing the countdown a year in advance, accuracy becomes increasingly important as the event approaches,” Tarman said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/12/why-bitcoin-halving-calculators-are-out-of-sync,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/700bd64b00eef28e8e3f60a9cfa7371b1c525d08-1652x880.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A screenshot of a document describing the eligibility criteria for the airdrop was posted on the social-media platform X by the user @Bitcoineo, and Avail’s public-relations team flagged the tweet to CoinDesk, describing it as a ""leak.""  A project spokesperson said that the Avail team was not available to make a statement on Friday.  The screenshot of the eligibility requirements suggests that users of layer-2 rollups, like Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, zkSync and Starknet, as well as ecosystem developers and Polygon PoS stakers, could receive the AVAIL token.  Sandeep Nailwal, the co-founder of Polygon, also expressed excitement about the airdrop for the Polygon community, in his own post on X.  Avail used to be part of Polygon, but was spun out in March 2023. Anurag Arjun, the founder of Avail, was a co-founder of Polygon.  Avail’s airdrop comes as its competitors in the data availability space are gaining momentum – part of the trend of ""modular"" blockchains, where functionality previously was only available on ""monolithic"" blockchains like Ethereum are now being broken out as separate plug-in modules.  Celestia, another data availability (DA) solution, had its TIA airdrop in November 2023, and the token already has a circulating market capitalization of $1.8 billion.EigenLayer, with its own in-house DA solution EigenDA, went live earlier this week with the project on the Ethereum blockchain, though officials have not confirmed plans for a token.

25627077,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602908,1712943027,Shiba Inu Sell Pressure Is Dropping – Here’s What It Means For Price,"The majority of Shiba Inu investors have been left confused about the crypto’s price trajectory in the past few weeks. While the crypto has experienced a period of stagnation in the past two weeks, recent on-chain data shows that the outlook might be looking bullish again, particularly as selling has slowed dramatically this week. At the same time, Shiba Inu has now crossed a major milestone in the number of addresses, which could mean an increase in the number of holders. Shiba Inu Sell Pressure Drops The price of Shiba Inu can easily be moved by selling and buying pressure from investors. Recent on-chain data, however, indicates that the selling pressure is currently decreasing, which could manifest in the price of the SHIB in the coming week. Particularly, IntoTheBlock’s historical active address by profitability shows the yearly average now shifting towards wallet addresses at the money. Related Reading: XRP Sees An Alarming 1,800% Surge In Liquidations, Whats Going On? Interestingly, this cohort of traders is now at almost 74.6%, meaning they contribute to the majority of the buying and selling action. However, their “at the money status” doesn’t give a clear path to their actions, as they could either be selling or increasing their holdings at the current price. On the other hand, this metric indicates better action among the active portion of addresses that are “in the money.” Interestingly, these “in the money” addresses have now seen their year-to-date activity average falling below 18%. This cohort of traders, who would normally be selling after reaching profits on their holdings, have failed to conduct a tangible number of transactions. Interestingly, this indicates they might be opting to hold right now in order to increase their unrealized profits. Similarly, on-chain data shows a substantial amount of SHIB moving out of the hands of short-term holders, contributing to a drop in selling pressure. About 4% of the entire circulating supply of SHIB has moved from short-term holders to mid-term holders in the past week. Mid-term holders hold their assets for more than a month to a year, in contrast to short-term holders, who are known for holding for less than a month before selling. Source: IntoTheBlock What’s Next For SHIB? With decreasing sell pressure and a shift to longer holding times, SHIB is poised for a reversal and continued upward momentum. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002766, down by 1.1% in the past 24 hours and up by 4.65% in a larger 7-day timeframe. Related Reading: The Era Of Flippenings: Can Dogecoin Take XRP’s Spot? Shiba Inu recently attained a milestone of 4 million addresses, which could mean an increase in activity is on the horizon. A surge in activity could see SHIB repeating a bullish pattern from the 2021 bull run. According to crypto analyst Bunchhieng, if history were to repeat itself, a repeat of this pattern would see SHIB rising to $0.0001.

25623438,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602915,1712937606,Dogecoin Usurped: These Memecoins Overtake DOGE In Active Trader Count,"On-chain data suggests Dogecoin is no longer the dominant meme coin in terms of its weekly active trader count. Here are the coins above it. Dogecoin Has Been Surpassed In Trader Count By Other Memecoins According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, DOG and DEGEN are the two assets that have managed to surpass the original meme-based cryptocurrency in terms of weekly trader count. A “trader” here refers to an investor who has been holding onto their coins since less than 30 days ago. These investors generally tend to move their coins often, as they play the role of active traders in the market. They are certainly not the HODLers of the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back Above $70,000 Despite Negative Taker Volume When the number of these traders goes up for any asset, it means that some fresh interest is potentially coming into the coin. Price actions like rallies are only sustainable when they have an ever-increasing fuel coming in, so the trader count going up can perhaps be a bullish indication in this direction. On the other hand, the metric going down implies traders either are losing interest in the cryptocurrency or have decided to hold onto it in the long term, thus maturing past the 30-day threshold. Whatever the case be, though, a drawdown in the indicator does suggest a lack of new hands coming into the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the number of traders for the various meme coins in the sector: The data for the number of traders for meme-based tokens over the past couple of years | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As displayed in the chart, Dogecoin (in blue) has consistently remained number one in terms of the number of traders, which only makes sense as DOGE has generally been the most popular meme coin, as its market cap would indicate. Hype and excitement are usually the number one driver for attracting users to a cryptocurrency. It would appear, though, that DOGE has recently been falling off in this metric. “While DOGE has long dominated almost every metric in the memecoin market, it seems to be losing some of its dominance,” says the analytics firm. The interest behind the coin may thus not be at the same level anymore. As for which meme coins have overtaken the cryptocurrency so far, IntoTheBlock notes, “DEGEN currently leads with 129k active traders, followed by DOG with 126k.” Related Reading: Bitcoin 2 Months Through “Euphoria Wave,” How Long Was The Last One? Given this high interest in these memecoins, it’s possible they may be likely to go through some volatility in the near future as all these traders make moves at once. In theory, this volatility can take these coins in either direction, but as the intelligence platform explains, “a strong increase in traders usually coincides with bullish momentum.” DOGE Price Dogecoin had slipped below the $0.17 level last week, but the coin has since bounced back as it’s now trading just under $0.20.

Ahmed was arrested last year on wire fraud and money laundering charges, after federal officials alleged he stole $9 million from a DEX built on Solana – which appears to be Crema Finance. He pleaded guilty to one count of computer fraud in December.  He will also forfeit $12.3 million and pay $5 million in restitution as part of his sentence.  Prosecutors asked for a four-year sentence, noting that the statutory maximum was five years but Ahmed had accepted responsibility by pleading guilty and surrendering the proceeds of the hacks and therefore warranted ""a slightly below Guidelines variance,"" according to a sentencing memo filed last week.  Ahmed's defense team argued for no prison time, saying that in addition to his acceptance of responsibility, he had voluntarily disclosed his hack of Nirvana Finance to prosecutors.  ""Shakeeb already had been indicted for the Crypto Exchange hack, and the government had offered Shakeeb a deal to plead guilty to that hack,"" the defense filing said. ""Although Shakeeb knew that disclosing another hack would result in additional consequences, and could take his favorable plea deal off of the table, Shakeeb voluntarily came forward anyway.""  In a statement, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said Ahmed's guilty plea was ""the first ever conviction for the hack of a smart contract.""  ""No matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice.

42418412,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgxbx,1712934712,The Halving Highlights Why Bitcoin Needs to Upgrade,"In mid-April of this year, Bitcoin will undergo its most recent halving event, meaning a 50% reduction in rewards for miners. Generally speaking, this event is seen as bullish for bitcoin, and the halvings of the past have all been followed by significant gains in the price of bitcoin. Of course, this comes at the immediate cost of revenue for those mining the asset.  Bob Bodily is the Provo, Utah-based CEO and Co-Founder of Bioniq, a BTC Ordinals marketplace. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's ""Future of Bitcoin,"" package published to coincide with the Halving in April 2024.  This time may be different, though. The recent implementation of new protocols that offer enhanced functionality, as well as the billions of dollars of inflows to bitcoin ETFs, has changed the nature of the market and demand for this asset. Post halving, we may see activity on the network unlike ever before, driving up fees and helping to compensate for the reduced block rewards.  However, to capitalize on this, what is needed now is a change to Bitcoin on a fundamental level, one that can fix the very issues holding back broader adoption.  Into the Halving  The latest halving comes amid significant developments for the asset and protocol, most notably, the proliferation of Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens over the previous year. These assets are already understood as effectively being NFTs that work on top of Bitcoin, and they have unlocked new functionality for the ecosystem that was never possible before.  Read more: Andy Handika - Ordinals Defy Bitcoin's Design Principles but Offer Miners Huge Post-Halving Advantages  The popularity of these new digital goods could have a major impact on what happens to miner revenue in the wake of this halving. While this event itself is slashing returns for mining blocks, Ordinals and BRC-20s are driving up network fees, as they are relatively expensive to inscribe and trade.  What’s more, this halving will see the launch of a brand new type of asset on Bitcoin, Runes. Runes, developed by Casey Rodarmor, the inventor of Ordinals, enters the fray as a similar but new evolution of the idea of building assets on top of the existing blockchain and are designed to be a much more efficient way for users to issue fungible tokens on the network.  Despite their efficiency, Runes still represent yet another type of asset that will be in-demand in the post halving era, further driving up Bitcoin blockspace demand, network activity, and, subsequently, miner fees. Taken alongside the recent influx of funds from ETFs, this situation stands to offset, if not entirely replace, the income that previously was generated from mining rewards alone. The result could be that this halving may not affect miners the way previous ones did, possibly augmenting how the market ultimately responds.  We need to update Bitcoin  The high fees may be good for miners, but they also stand to drive development to the fragmented world of Layer 2s, ultimately siloing liquidity and harming the end-user experience. Higher fees could also impede adoption globally, especially among price-sensitive users in developing countries who may need bitcoin the most.  To unlock the possibilities that the best talent in Web3 has to offer, developers need to be given the tools to build easily, efficiently and interoperably on top of Bitcoin. However, to achieve this, changes will need to be addressed at a Layer 1 level. Fortunately, there are some paths forward being explored right now that aren’t built on Layer 2’s. For example, there has been a proposal to reintroduce the “OP_CAT” opcode that would allow for multiple script variables to be concatenated into one, which would significantly improve the ability for developers to build on top of the network and deploy new services in a highly efficient manner.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - 12 Future Bitcoin Scenarios: From Bullish to Bearish  This comes alongside another proposal for implementing what is known as CTV, which makes it possible to set constrictions around how a Bitcoin transaction is spent. Taken together, these potential updates represent a Layer 1 blockchain that is simultaneously more efficient and safer to build on, which should attract new development.  Out of all of the potential op_codes that we could add to Bitcoin, CTV and CAT are the top two contenders. Among developers, CTV is the no-brainer upgrade for Bitcoin. It is simple, elegant, and adds meaningful functionality to the network with covenants. Unfortunately, CTV has faced some political issues in getting widespread support. Then we have groups like the Taproot Wizards, who released an ordinals cat collection, the Quantum Cats, specifically to drive attention to OP_CAT and push the network to get CAT officially added. CAT was originally in Bitcoin (removed early on), is only 10 lines of code, and has significant support for adoption across all the major groups within Bitcoin.  There’s no guarantee that these proposed updates to Bitcoin will be the accepted, or final, solution to bringing better functionality and adoption to Bitcoin. That being said, they put the blockchain in the best possible position to get the most out of the implementation of new protocols like BRC-20 and Runes.

42418400,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgxTh,1712934541,How to Get Funded in Crypto,"There is one topic among entrepreneurs that I’ve found never seems to get old despite countless articles, interviews and talks given on it. That topic is fundraising. As someone who’s collectively raised somewhere between $40 million and $50 million across different projects in the past few years, and with years of experience in venture capital myself, I hope that you find some value in it.  Azeem Khan is a co-founder of Ethereum layer-2 Morph, consultant to UNICEF and venture partner at Foresight Ventures.  After recently announcing the $20 million seed round for Morph, an Ethereum layer 2 using a hybrid optimistic/zero-knowledge rollup and decentralized sequencer, I’ve had countless entrepreneurs reaching out to me asking how I did it. And so I thought it made sense to summarize some key understandings I have about fundraising itself in a more scalable way. Below are some common themes to understand when looking to fundraise that may help you, regardless of the kind of market you’re in.  The first thing you need to learn is what a venture capitalist does. It’s actually pretty boring. VCs invest money their limited partners (LPs) give them and look to make sizable financial returns. LPs are individuals or entities who provide capital to VCs in the form of an investment.  In other words, a VC’s job is to take money they’re given and turn it into more money for their LPs. In a literal sense, VCs are just middle men for much richer individuals or organizations looking to allocate funds to a riskier part of their portfolios for higher returns.  Now that we have established that a VC is just a money broker for wealthier people or organizations, you need to start to craft a narrative to achieve a similar outcome. A shared story takes you from facing the VC on opposite sides of the table to metaphorically sitting with them collaboratively trying to create a shared outcome together.  What is it about the thing you’re building that holds so much promise? Sure, a VC will want to hear about why what you’re proposing is a technically sound idea, but for the most part VCs aren’t technical people. Many come from more traditional finance, banking or consulting related jobs.  In other words, VCs are people looking to hear a compelling narrative about why it is that your company will be able to succeed in the sea of other companies saying they can do the same. Your ideas for Go-To-Market (GTM) really need to be fleshed out because that is what they’re going to grill you on.  It’s really all about storytelling. Steve Jobs once famously said the most powerful person in the world is the storyteller. He was right so tell that story. If you’re not able to articulate this then you need to go back to the drawing board because you’re likely not ready to raise funds.  If you are in a position to articulate this then it’s time to put together a simple pitch deck. In reality, most VCs spend a few minutes, at most, reading this document, oftentimes never reading it because they expect you to go through it when you pitch to them. Because this is the case you need to be able to keep it concise.  The deck in total should be no more than 10-15 slides. In those few pages you need to introduce your idea, why you’re building it, how big the market is, who would want to pay for it and why is it that you’re the team to do it. Again, if you can’t succinctly do this then you’re not ready to raise money.  Once you’re in a position to raise money you need to understand which VC funds are even the ones that invest in ideas like yours. Different funds specialize in different verticals. Do your research. Don’t be the person who goes to a fund that invests in consumer products trying to pitch them an artificial intelligence company.  See also: Chris Dixon Talks Techno-Optimism  The next part of this is how exactly do you get in front of VCs? Well, it’s easier said than done, but still can get done. After all, it is the job of a VC to speak to startups, but you still need to take into account how human interactions work with trusted networks. Legitimacy is the scarcest resource so find a way to create legitimacy.  The first principle to take into account here is to understand that warm introductions are almost the only way you’re going to have a VC take you seriously. Unless you’re in a position where you have a product that’s doing excellent in the market already, your objective is to find a way to get warm intros.  Reach out to people you’ve researched asking to tell them about your idea and ask if you can get an introduction. At the end of the day, the best introduction to a VC will either be another VC or the founder of a company they have already invested in.  One last interesting caveat in this process is that you’re likely never going to get outright rejected by most VCs if you’ve done the above steps correctly. What you’ll often hear them say is that they will pass for now, but they’d like to hear what kind of progress you’ve got a few months down the line. That’s because they know they are playing a relationship game to always get access to deals. Because maybe tomorrow your company will be the talk of the town.  Just understand that raising money takes time, and your follow up game is of the utmost importance.",NEUTRAL,없음,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Azeem Khan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/12/how-to-get-funded-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0469313dfda8d51565fcec0eeb87746d4b45ae47-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ripple just unlocked a massive amount of tokens from escrow, which could threaten the price further. Ripple Unlocks 500 Million XRP In the early hours of Friday, on-chain whale tracking platform Whale Alert posted two transactions carrying a notable number of XRP tokens. The first transaction saw 200 million tokens unlocked from the escrow wallet, worth $122.63 million at the time of the transfer. Related Reading: Cardano At Risk Of Crashing To $0.4 As Important Metrics Turn Bearish The second transaction came minutes later when a total of 300 million XRP tokens were also unclosed from escrow. This second tranche of tokens, being larger than the first, was worth $183.89 million at the time, bringing the total number of unlocked tokens to 500 million. Together, both transactions were worth over $300 million. These unlocks have, unsurprisingly, stirred concern in the Ripple community for a number of reasons. One of the reasons is that Ripple never does unlocks in the middle of the month. Rather, they do scheduled unlocks at the start of each month. So, these transactions have drawn the attention of the crypto community. Another cause for concern is the fact that Ripple could be selling these XRP tokens. Hence, putting more tokens in circulation and adding more selling pressure to the already struggling digital asset. However, Ripple has not shown any indication of what these unlocks could be for as there have been no transfer transactions since then, just the unlock transactions. Unlocks Can Send Price Crashing? XRP unlocks are not new to the Ripple community, as scheduled unlocks take place every month. These unlocks see 1 billion XRP tokens unlocked from the escrow according to schedule. But most times, the majority of the unlocked tokens are sent back to escrow. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Price Will Reach $0.0001 If This Happens Usually, these unlocks do not negatively affect the altcoin’s price, but that’s when the unlocks are expected. This time around, the unlocks are unplanned, leading to speculation as to why Ripple would be unlocking XRP tokens outside of the unlock schedule. So far, the XRP price seems to not be reacting to the unlock at all. It continues to trend around $0.61, with small losses of 0.91% in the last day. However, the altcoin is still seeing 4.74% gains in the last week, showing the positive upside that it saw earlier in the week.

Crypto continues to be a high priority for IOSCO, which published a series of recommendations for the sector last year.  The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is turning its attention to tokenization, the standard setting body set out in its strategy for the year on Friday.  The work will build on the IOSCO FinTech Task Force's existing principles and guidance for crypto, and it will focus on tokenization use cases that are specific to the securities market and distributed ledger technology. The output will help IOSCO analyze whether or not further policy direction is needed, according to the strategy.  ""The objective of this work is to develop a shared understanding among IOSCO members on the adoption and current use-cases of asset tokenisation in the securities markets,"" the report said.  Regulators and financial institutions have been leaning more into tokenization -- which is the digitization of real-world assets. A group of central banks recently launched a tokenization project. A report backed by the U.K. government also encouraged firms to execute their tokenization strategies. Meanwhile, major investment companies such as Blackrock entered the tokenization race last month, and tokens including ONDO have been jumping as the technology advances.  Crypto has already been a high priority for IOSCO. The organization published its final recommendations for the sector in November and decentralized finance recommendations in December. IOSCO's crypto-asset implementation roadmap was also approved last winter. The body plans to develop an assessment methodology by the second half of the year and will update its 2020 report on investor education concerning crypto assets for retail investors this year.

Due to the recent momentum, crypto enthusiasts are becoming less pessimistic about the digital asset’s growth prior to the halving event. With the fast approaching much-anticipated Bitcoin Halving, Rekt Capital, a well-recognized cryptocurrency analyst and aficionado, has offered his market insights mapping out three distinct stages of the event for investors. 3 Distinct Aspects Of The Bitcoin Halving Rekt Capital’s analysis delves into Bitcoin‘s movement before and after the halving takes place, which is expected to happen this month. In the seven days leading up to the occurrence, the crypto analyst underscored three stages to observe for a successful outcome. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $150,000 Is “Programmed” With Halving Approaching: Analyst These three phases include the final pre-halving retrace, the re-accumulation phase, and the parabolic uptrend phase. Emphasizing on the first aspect, Rekt Capital noted that the pre-halving retrace is documented in the books and has already manifested. During this period, Bitcoin experienced an 18% pullback compared to 2016 and 2020’s retracement of 38% and 19%, respectively. The expert believes that the concluded pre-halving Retrace was the last chance to purchase a deal during the pre-halving phase. Following the conclusion of the retrace, Rekt Capital has confirmed the development has laid the groundwork for the Re-accumulation range. It is important to note that the aforementioned range occurs a few weeks ahead of the halving, and it ends with a breakout from it a few weeks later. Specifically, the period could last for several weeks and up to 150 days or five months. Given the manifestation of the range, sideways movement through the halving and beyond is the major purpose of BTC. Thus, the analyst has stressed the need to be patient around this phase, as many investors get frustrated, bored, and disappointed here because their Bitcoin investments lack significant returns. As a result, they lose confidence and get shaken out of the market before the event. BTC’s Post-Halving Rally Might Mirror Previous Trend As for the parabolic uptrend, Rekt Capital claims the phase will begin when Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation range. He further stated that the price of BTC tends to grow more quickly and enters a parabolic upsurge during this stage. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Go ‘Ballistic’ After Halving, Says Top Analyst – Here’s Why According to the expert, this area has typically lasted about a year or a little more, particularly around 385 days in the past. However, with the possible accelerated cycle that is currently in development, the period could be halved within this bull market cycle. Rekt Capital’s key perspectives came amidst Bitcoin demonstrating strength to revisit its current all-time high of $73,000. BTC has managed to amass gains of more than 6% in the past few days. It recovered to the $70,000 level after plunging as low as $67,000 on Wednesday and is getting close to $71,000. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $70,854, indicating over 6% increase in the past week. Its market capitalization is up by 1% and its trading volume has plummeted by more than 21% over the past day. Given the current trend in the coin market, BTC could be in a position to see even bigger gains in the months to come.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) is stable, trading above $70,000 as bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) total net inflow comes to $91 million. BlackRock saw inflows of $192 million on Thursday, while outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) picked up again. Almost $125 million flowed out of GBTC on Thursday, according to on-chain data. Up to Thursday, the bitcoin ETFs had reported a total weekly outflow of $227.9 million. Some industry participants say continued outflows from GBTC put selling pressure on BTC and drive down prices while others have a wait-and-see approach, highlighting that outflows are to be expected from GBTC, given its higher fee structure.  The stewards of the TON ecosystem formed a partnership with HashKey Group, the parent company of the Hong Kong-licensed crypto exchange of the same name. One of the aims of the partnership is to increase provision for Asia-Pacific users of messaging app Telegram's wallet to enter and leave the service with both fiat currencies and crypto. The TON blockchain started life as an in-house project by Telegram in 2018 and was abandoned two years later following legal action from the SEC. Members of the community then formed the TON Foundation to continue its development, with Telegram's endorsement.  Recent news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating companies associated with the Ethereum Foundation is consistent with the view that there is no more than a 50% chance of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in May, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Thursday. The bank reiterated its view that approval of these products is unlikely next month, a position first expressed in January. The SEC must make final decisions on some ETF applications by May 23. The regulator approved spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January, stirring speculation in some quarters that versions for ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain, may follow suit. “If there is no spot ether ETF approval in May, then we assume there is going to be litigation against the SEC after May,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows prices for bitcoin, gold and the U.S. dollar index (DXY) since October.  Bitcoin's rally has stalled since setting record highs above $73,000 in mid-March, while gold continues to clock new lifetime highs, brushing aside the resurgent DXY.  Analysts remain confident of bitcoin's prospects as U.S. debt concerns will likely force the Fed to cut rates this year.

Following a peak at a 23-month high at $0.808 on March 11, the price of ADA has fallen by over 28%, and it is now hovering just below the $0.60 level. Notably, Cardano has underperformed compared to its competitors, slipping to the 10th position among the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. However, a crypto analyst, known as Trend Rider (@TrendRidersTR) on X, has declared that ADA is showing clear signs of a bull run based on technical analysis of its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossovers. What This Means For Cardano Price According to Trend Rider’s recent post on X, Cardano’s current market behavior mirrors a rare pattern in the one month chart (ADA/USD) observed only once before, which led to a significant price surge from $0.05 to $3.00. Related Reading: Cardano At Risk Of Crashing To $0.4 As Important Metrics Turn Bearish The analyst emphasized, “ADA’s undeniable bull run is here. With its second RSI crossover in history, it’s reminiscent of when prices soared from $0.05 to $3. This rare event, marking a potential trend shift as the RSI crosses its SMA, has flawlessly predicted past cycles shifts at it’s early stages.” The analysis presented by Trend Rider focuses on the RSI, a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, and its crossover with the SMA, a common trading signal interpreted as a potential bullish or bearish market indicator. The post details three critical phases in Cardano’s recent market activity. The first crossover occurred shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic onset when ADA traded at $0.19, marked by a substantial price increase following the crossover event. At the end of the 2021 bull run, a bearish crossover took place that heralded a prolonged bear market. “Notice how perfect the bearish crossover anticipated the bear market. This is an extremely strong validation for this indicator. Making it very relevant to predict ADA long term cycles,” the analyst states. The second bullish crossover of the RSI with the SMA occurred in October and November 2023, this event was initially met with market rejection a few months earlier, adding credibility to the indicator’s reliability in predicting long-term market trends. Related Reading: “Where It Should Be”: Crypto Analyst Remains Firm On $1.7 Prediction For Cardano (ADA) Trend Rider concludes, “The RSI and its SMA crossovers are an extremely reliable source to identify ADA bull runs and bear markets at its early stages.” This analysis suggests that Cardano is currently entering a bull market phase, reinforcing the optimistic outlook for ADA. Moreover, the analyst warned the one-month chart reflects a macro perspective for holders, “each candle represents one month, so you can expect huge volatility within each candle.” Furthermore, he cautioned of the inherent risks in crypto investments, noting the importance of a personalized investment strategy to navigate potential market volatility and unforeseen events, often referred to as ‘black swan’ events. “VERY IMPORTANT: Personally, these macro charts help me see the bigger picture, but I always use my own process to secure profits and protect myself from any black swan event,” Trend Rider added. If history is any indicator, the current patterns could spell a lucrative phase for Cardano holders, but as always in crypto markets, caution remains a critical companion to enthusiasm.

In less than a year, Base has already resulted in more gross profit than both Optimism and Arbitrum. Annualizing current rates, the Base sequencer will generate $185 million in revenue. As the lone sequencer on Base, the argument could potentially be made that Coinbase is opening itself up to additional regulatory scrutiny. It's been a little over 4 months since I last covered Coinbase ( COIN ) for Seeking Alpha. Each of my last two COIN articles have focused mainly on Coinbase's Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) scaling network called ""Base."" In my prior note, I was fairly underwhelmed by the activity trend on Base as daily transactions were declining, stablecoin market was decreasing, and the network was losing share to L2 scaling peer Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ). Things have changed. Since Ethereum's Dencun upgrade in March, Base usage has absolutely taken off and the economics of the network have arguably improved even as average transaction fees have fallen. In this update, we'll again explore the Base network and detail the impact it could ultimately have on Coinbase's longer term business trajectory. Base Network Data Following the Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum network, it was widely expected that the biggest beneficiaries of the change would be the layer 2 scaling chains that rollup transactions on top of the Ethereum's main layer. The reasoning is pretty simple; the cost for L2s to submit transaction data to Ethereum's main layer were going to decline as a result of that upgrade. This cost reduction to publish on Ethereum would allow user fees on the scaling chains to decline dramatically. That has indeed happened and the result of improved transaction economics has encouraged users to transact more: Base Daily Transactions vs Fees (Token Terminal) Prior to Dencun, the largest single day transaction total for the Base blockchain was 1.9 million on September 19th of last year. As of April 10th 2024, Base has processed at least 3 million transactions each day for seven consecutive days and at an average transaction fee of 16.9 cents per transaction. At that price per transaction, Base has been doing over a half million in daily fee revenue over the last week. Of course, this revenue comes with a cost as well. Base network profitability (Dune Analytics/Sealaunch) The Base blockchain data has to be published to the main layer of the Ethereum blockchain - this is where the world is seemingly Base's oyster at the moment thanks to Dencun. Base has notoriously had a relatively high profit margin on this activity already and it seems the Dencun Upgrade has created an explosive surge in aggregate profit. Base Cumulative Profit (Dune Analytics/Sealaunch) Cumulatively, Base has generated $47 million in fee revenue against $16 million in Ethereum publishing expense for a net profit of $31 million since the chain launched last year. The cumulative profit from activity on Base has already surpassed that of both Optimism ( OP-USD ) and Arbitrum - though Aribtrum is close at $30 million. That said, Arbitrum has been live since 2021; far longer than Base. Base vs The Field L2 Daily Fee Trend Comparison (Artemis) Interestingly, none of the other major Ethereum scaling networks seem to be enjoying the surge in fees that Base seems to be earning post-Dencun. If one wants to annualize that level of engagement with the network at the 17 cent average transaction price, Base would be generating about $185 million in fee revenue from the Base blockchain in a 12 month period. This would be a 56% incremental increase in the amount of blockchain rewards revenue Coinbase did in 2023. L2 Rollup Revenue Share (Dune Analytics/Sealaunch) In the chart above, the darker blue portion represents Base's share of all L2 rollup revenue. Base's share of that revenue was generally in the 10-20% range since it's inception leading up to Dencun. Post-Dencun that share has exploded to over half of L2 rollup revenue share since mid-March. It's a month of data and we have to see how sustainable all of this is. But the early indication is Ethereum's Dencun upgrade has been a huge growth catalyst for Coinbase's L2 blockchain. Naturally, one can't help but wonder what is driving all of this activity. Chain Engagement Generally smart contract blockchains built on top of Ethereum, or any EVM chain for that matter, are utilized by decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocols like Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) and Aave ( AAVE-USD ). DEX and lending protocols like these allow users to trade, borrow, and lend their crypto assets through what are typically ""permission-less"" front end applications. DeFi Llama shows Base currently supporting 251 DeFi protocols - more than Solana ( SOL-USD ) and Tron ( TRON-USD ) combined. Base Stablecoins vs Fees (DeFi Llama) The biggest thing driving TVL growth on Base currently is an explosion in stablecoins. Before Dencun, there was approximately $300 million in stablecoins on Base - most of which was Circle's USDC ( USDC-USD ) which Coinbase shares interest revenue from. As of article submission, the stablecoin footprint on Base is just under $1.9 billion. This level of liquidity on Base, coupled with lower trading fees via Dencun, has resulted in massive swap volume growth among the DEX protocols on Base - the largest of which is Uniswap. Base DEX Volume (Dune Analytics/Vending Machine) Essentially what is happening here is Coinbase is allowing the front end trading applications to be decentralized in what I assume is an expectation that most of the actual revenue from those swaps will be retained by the Base blockchain network. It's actually really smart in my opinion because it's a way for Coinbase to effectively monetize users trading new crypto tokens without actually listing them on the company's flagship ""centralized exchange"" product. New Tokens - Chain Share (The Block) Consider that so far through April, Base has accounted for more than 50% of the new tokens appearing via DEXes on any chain. Base has an even larger new token share than Solana at the moment, which has been a meme-coin paradise for months. It bears repeating that despite Base being a permission-less public blockchain network, Coinbase is the lone sequencer and thus decides where those network fees ultimately go. Base Fees By Recipient (The Block) I mentioned in a prior Base-focused Coinbase article that the company has claimed it will split those fees with the Optimism Collective. To this point, it looks like Coinbase is indeed doing that but is retaining the overwhelming majority of those fees. In short, Coinbase is now profiting from traders swapping what I think we can safely assume are some of the riskiest altcoins in the market via its Base sequencer. Regulatory Risk Some investors may take issue with the company effectively profiting from traders who choose DEX protocols on Base rather than the KYC/AML compliant CEX product that Coinbase has long been primarily known for. In my view, this could be a potential regulatory problem down the line. I'm certainly no law expert and philosophically have no personal issues with permission-less blockchains or DEXes. It would come at the expense of some revenue, but I suspect it might be in Coinbase's legal interest to take steps to decentralize the Base sequencer. Otherwise, I would imagine it could be argued that Base decentralization is more optics than actual substance. Sequencer centralization is certainly not unique to just Base as I think we could likely say the same about many L2 blockchains that scale Ethereum. But the more Base eats the rest of the L2 market on Ether, the more potential damage to the broader US crypto industry could theoretically be done if regulators get more aggressive with the company after allowing Base to take market share from major competitors.

Nearly every spot Bitcoin ETF provider in the United States chose Coinbase as the custodian for the fund holdings. The company just grew Q1 exchange volume by over 111% year over year per data from The Block. The short term t-bill rates backing USDC are still over 5% and rate cuts as late as July are now a tossup. We can now add that the company is also running the sequencer of one of the largest public chains in the entire DeFi ecosystem. And yet, I still can't bring myself to call this stock a buy when it's trading at 12x forward sales and 100x forward earnings.

About US$41 million in digital assets invested with the companies by more than 450 Australians has been handed to restructuring specialists.  The Australian Securities and Investment Commission alleges the companies broke the law and provided financial services without the appropriate license.  An Australian Federal Court agreed to a petition from the nation's market regulator to hand over approximately US$41 million in digital assets invested by over 450 Australians with the NGS group of blockchain mining companies to three specialists from McGrathNicol, an independent advisory and restructuring company.  The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) said on Friday that it had commenced civil proceedings against NGS Crypto, NGS Digital and NGS Group and the sole directors of the companies: Brett Mendham, Ryan Brown and Mark Ten Caten, respectively. Mendham is also restrained from traveling outside of Australia.  The court order came after ASIC alleged the companies breached Australian law and provided financial services without an Australian financial services license.  ""ASIC alleges that the NGS Companies target Australian investors to invest in blockchain mining packages with fixed-rate returns, encouraging them to use funds transferred from regulated super funds to self-managed super funds (SMSFs) and then converted into cryptocurrency,"" the regulator said.  The involvement of a restructuring company does not necessarily suggest the companies have collapsed. ASIC said it was concerned the funds were at risk of dissipation and appointing a receiver was the best way to protect the assets.  While it continues to investigate, ASIC has not sought an outright ban on the companies but only interim and final injunctions preventing them from operating without a license.  The NGS companies did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.

42418408,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgxZt,1712920876,Bitcoin Cash Sends Bitcoin Traders Warning Sign About Halving,"BCH's post-halving slide of 15% might be a warning sign for bitcoin bulls.  Bitcoin cash has been seen a proxy for the upcoming halving of rewards on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Bitcoin's blockchain will halve rewards on April 20.  Bitcoin's fourth mining reward halving, a programmed 50% reduction in the pace of supply expansion, is just eight days away. This event, scheduled to happen every four years, has historically presaged multi-month bull runs.  However, ahead of the pivotal event, bitcoin's {{BTC}} offshoot bitcoin cash {{BCH}} is flashing a warning, asking traders to reassess expectations for an immediate post-halving price rise.  The rally in BCH, a cryptocurrency created in 2017 from the hard fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain, ran out of steam above $715 one day after its parent blockchain halved per block coin emission to 3.125 BCH on April 4. Since then, BCH's prices have declined 15% to $604, CoinDesk data show.  The notional open interest or the dollar value locked in the number of active perpetual futures tied to BCH has collapsed 70% to $376 million in seven days, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, the annualized perpetual funding rates across major exchanges turned negative early this week, indicating an unwinding of bullish bets. Negative funding rates mean perpetuals trade at a discount to the underlying asset's spot price.  According to algorithmic trading firm Wintermute, BCH has been seen as a proxy for BTC's impending halving, meaning the leading cryptocurrency could face selling pressure after April 20.  ""Over the last month, fast money has been seen in BCH - potentially trading the coin as a proxy for the upcoming Bitcoin halving; an interesting move in funding rates as perps currently trade under spot,"" Wintermute said in a weekly newsletter shared with CoinDesk.  Several analysts have warned that BTC has already priced in the impending slowdown in the pace of supply expansion and could drop in a classic ""sell the news"" type move following the halving. Investment banking giant JPMorgan expects a sell-off to $42,000 once the halving hype subsides.  Bitcoin changed hands at $70,700 at press time, representing a 67% year-to-date gain, CoinDesk data shows. Prices recently surpassed the 2021 peak, reaching fresh record highs above $73,000 well before halving. Historically, new highs have come months after halving.  According to 10X Research, post-halving miner sales could make it more difficult for bulls to push prices higher in the upcoming summer months.  ""Based on our calculations, miners will potentially liquidate $5 billion worth of BTC after the halving. The overhang from this selling could last four to six months, explaining why bitcoin might go sideways for the next few months – as it has done in the past,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, said.  Bitcoin miners are entities that solve complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain in return for rewards paid in BTC. The impending halving is set to reduce their per-block reward by 50%.",NEGATIVE,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/12/bitcoin-cash-sends-bitcoin-traders-warning-sign-about-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd041eaa70809af7c561cf69f236d9ce12b2c810-1690x1138.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Native token Toncoin was largely unmoved immediately following the announcement.  The stewards of the TON ecosystem have formed a partnership with HashKey Group, the parent company of the Hong Kong-licensed crypto exchange of the same name.  One of the aims of the partnership is to increase provision for on- and off-ramping of crypto and fiat to Asia-Pacific users of the wallet service in messaging app Telegram.  The TON blockchain started life as an in-house project by Telegram in 2018 but was abandoned two years later following legal action from the SEC. Members of the community then formed the TON Foundation to continue its development, with Telegram's endorsement.  HashKey and the Foundation are focussing their partnership on Hong Kong in the first phase but say they will expand to other APAC markets should their initial efforts prove a success, according to an emailed announcement on Friday.  TON's native token, Toncoin climbed around 1.7% in the hour following the announcement, down nearly 4% in the last 24 hours. For comparison, the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which shows a weighted measurement of the digital asset market, has declined around 1.3% in the same timeframe.

A recent surge in VET’s price, coupled with technical breakthroughs, has ignited a wave of optimism among investors and analysts. VeChain Shatters Resistance Levels, Bullish Flag Signals New Highs The good news for VeChain started with a decisive break above a multi-year downtrend line. This technical indicator, closely watched by analysts, suggests a potential shift in long-term market sentiment. Additionally, VET decisively surpassed a key horizontal resistance level, adding fuel to the bullish fire. At the time of writing, VET was trading at $0.04, down 3.1% in the last 24 hour, but managed to sustain a 17% gain the last week, data from Coingecko shows. Related Reading: Did Someone Forget The BONK? Trading Volume Plunges Over 70% Following this breakout, VeChain entered a consolidation phase, a period of sideways trading often seen after a significant price increase. However, this pause proved to be temporary. VET recently emerged from a bullish flag formation, a technical pattern known for preceding substantial price increases. Analysts are interpreting this breakout as a sign that VeChain is poised for another leg up. 400% Surge Anticipated: Will VeChain Live Up To The Hype? Capitalizing on the bullish sentiment, crypto analysts have made some bold predictions. World of Charts, a prominent analyst group, is forecasting a staggering 400% increase in VET’s value in the coming weeks. $Vet Recently #Vet Breaks Multiple Resistances Multi-year Descending Trendline+ Horizontal Resistance Accumulation Area & Retested Perfectly Also Now Breaking Bullish Flag Too Still Expecting 400% Profit In Coming Weeks In #VeChai https://t.co/NamieY9HrX pic.twitter.com/UhbFjRRCyT — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) April 11, 2024 X user Clifton Fx also provided a positive outlook.

The meme coin was trading over $66 as of Asian afternoon hours with a $516 million market capitalization, making it the third-largest Bitcoin-based token behind ordi (ORDI) and sats (SATS).  PUPS led global sales and volumes among all NFT collections, Cryptoslam data shows, with over $11 million in volumes. Uncategorized Bitcoin Ordinals collections and NodeMonkes were next with $7 million and $1 million in volumes – continuing a trend of interest in Bitcoin NFTs from earlier this week.  PUPS has rocketed over 1,000% in the past week, data shows, and was widely considered the “first” meme coin on Bitcoin – helping fuel virality and interest. Developers on Friday denied the claim.  PUPS is currently offered as an Ordinals token but intends to shift to the upcoming Runes protocol after the halving. Traders on social media platform X are hyping up Runes as the sector to look forward to, following a frenzy in the Solana and Base ecosystems.  What is Bitcoin Runes?  The upcoming Runes protocol is expected to go live after Bitcoin's halving. It will take the Ordinals protocol a step ahead by making transactions even more cheaper and faster – and traders say it’s a sector to watch for in the coming weeks.  Ordinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.  Runes takes this concept further by utilizing a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) protocol to generate transactions. This allows tokens to create, name, and transfer digital commodities only using the Bitcoin network.  UTXO is a technical term for the small amount of tokens that may remain after a cryptocurrency transaction.  Ordinals and Runes are both projects by long-time Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor, which has created trust and lent an idea of authenticity among users.  Rodarmor said in an X post earlier in April that the protocol is designed for “degens and meme coins,” fuelling hype among meme coin traders.  “Runes were built for degens and memecoins, but the protocol is simple, efficient, and secure. It is a legitimate competitor to Taproot Assets and RGB,” he said. The ordinals library provides everything needed to encode and decode runestones, so integration should be straightforward.”  “I'm highly skeptical of ""serious"" tokens, but runes are without a doubt a ""serious"" token protocol,” Rodarmor added at the time.",POSITIVE,ORDI,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ORDI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/12/bitcoin-meme-coin-pups-fuelled-by-hype-ahead-of-runes-release,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/419ea6e08eefcabac72ec447287078d5f0a6b95a-1536x864.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25604479,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602817,1712908819,Solana (SOL) Price Rally Over? What The Fundamentals Say,"Solana (SOL) has recently become a focal point of discussion among investors and analysts. After surging from below $22 to a high of $210 within six months, and currently trading at around $174—a nearly 700% increase—questions arise about the sustainability of its price rally. Despite the impressive surge, SOL remains 50% shy of its November 2021 all-time high of $260. The recent consolidation pattern over the past four weeks suggests a cooling off period. As the market looks forward, understanding the underlying fundamentals becomes crucial. Jamie Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst (CMT) at Real Vision, notes in an analysis, “While Solana’s outperformance has waned in the past month, it is still the best-performing network in the past 12–18 months by a country mile. Solana’s price adjustment seems abrupt but is aligned with fundamental indicators that suggest a stabilizing rather than diminishing value proposition,” Coutts explains. Solana Fundamentals Remain Strong Solana’s Daily Active Users (DAUs) have risen dramatically, up more than 400% over the last nine months. This growth places Solana in a rarefied group of networks boasting over 1 million DAUs. Despite not reaching its 2021 peak DAUs, which may have been inflated by synthetic activities linked to the FTX exchange, the nature of engagement on Solana has evolved. “The ecosystem is maturing; the engagement we see today is fundamentally different—more diverse and significantly more integrated with real-world applications,” Coutts remarked. He highlighted the burgeoning sectors contributing to this growth, including artificial intelligence, decentralized finance, consumer applications, and the burgeoning memecoin and NFT spaces. Related Reading: Trading Guru Uncovers This Notable Pattern On Solana: What’s Next For SOL Investors? With a significant retracement from its 2021 peak price, Solana’s market capitalization has still managed to hit new highs this cycle, suggesting a broadening base of investment and valuation recalibration. “The Network Value to User (NVU) ratio indicates that while the asset appreciation is notable, it’s the user growth that provides a compelling story for Solana,” Coutts notes. At present, Solana’s NVU ratio fluctuates between 50-100, reflective of a balanced growth-to-value dynamic when compared with other networks where speculative value often outstrips user growth. One of the standout metrics for Solana this cycle has been its fee revenue, which has seen a sixfold increase in a nine-month period. Daily fees now average $1.8 million, a fortyfold increase. This surge is largely attributable to the network’s increasing utilization across various applications. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Solana (SOL) Bounce Amid Network Congestion Problems “Fee income not reaching its peak is a misnomer; what’s crucial is that the financial underpinnings of the network—highlighted by fee income—are stronger than ever,” Coutts emphasized. He also compared Solana’s fee income, which reached about 20% of Ethereum’s in March, demonstrating its growing financial stature within the ecosystem. Solana Vs. Ethereum And Future Outlook While Solana still lags behind Ethereum in terms of total dApps, its economic indicators are robust. With 134 dApps, compared to Ethereum’s 2,702, Solana’s dApp cash flow intensity is second only to Ethereum, indicating a high monetization capability per application. “Solana’s smaller, more potent suite of applications is driving economic efficiency that rivals even the largest networks,” states Coutts. Despite the speculative components associated with memecoins and airdrops driving part of the transaction volume, Solana’s adjusted fee growth metric isolates and highlights genuine economic activity. With a staggering real fee growth rate of 3,259.7%, Solana leads all networks in this metric. “While some underlying activities might be transitory, the intense and growing usage of Solana’s blockchain is undeniable evidence of its utility and viability,” Coutts concludes. As Solana continues to develop and expand its ecosystem, the fundamental analysis underscores a network that not only maintains robust health and economic vigor but is also poised for future growth. This paints a picture of a blockchain platform that, despite market volatilities, remains a leading player in the crypto landscape, backed by strong fundamentals and promising growth metrics. At press time, SOL traded at $173.47.

42418399,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgxSf,1712908800,Ether.Fi Inks $500M Restaking Deal With RedStone Oracles,"RedStone Oracles, which provides data feeds for blockchains, is among a growing field of ""actively validated services"" (AVSs) waiting to tap into EigenLayer, the buzzy new ""restaking"" protocol that lets upstart networks borrow Ethereum's security. On Friday, RedStone announced that it had sealed a $500 million deal with Ether.Fi, the largest liquid restaking service on EigenLayer, to help power its oracle protocol.  EigenLayer deployed a limited version of its service to Ethereum's mainnet earlier this week, boasting more than $12 billion in user deposits – many of them from liquid restaking middlemen like Ether.Fi that aim to make the deposit process easier (and more lucrative) for end-users.  The billions of dollars in restaked deposits are set to play a lead role in the EigenLayer's ""pooled security"" system, which lets operators ""delegate"" their stake to help power specific AVSs.  Under its deal with RedStone, Ether.Fi will dedicate $500 million to help secure RedStone's data oracles, which are used to pass information between blockchains and the outside world.  ""A subset of over 20,000 node operators from Ether.fi will manage RedStone's Actively Validated Service (AVS) and employ Ether.fi’s native liquid restaking token - eETH,"" the companies said in a joint statement, ""The restaked Ether will serve as a safeguard against both liveness failures and crypto-economic attacks within the network of RedStone's node providers.""  Liquid restaking services funnel user deposits into EigenLayer and offer extra rewards on top, along with tradeable ""liquid restaking tokens"" that represent a user's underlying investment. Ether.fi has $3.8 billion locked up with EigenLayer – assets that will eventually help power the pooled security system. In return for deposits, Ether.fi grants users a derivative token, Ether.Fi ETH (eETH), which earns interest and can be traded in decentralized finance (DeFi).  Redstone isn't the first AVS to make a deal with Ether.fi. A similar agreement was announced in March, with Ether.Fi committing $600 million worth of its stake to Omni, an AVS network designed to help layer 2 rollups communicate with each other.  EigenLayer's has racked up over $15 billion in deposits in total, but the version live on Ethereum's mainnet is still lacking several core features. The only AVS that has been allowed to deploy onto the network so far has been EigenDA, a data availability service from Eigen Labs, the team behind EigenLayer.  AVS networks like Redstone Oracles are allowed to ""register"" with EigenLayer but will not be allowed to deploy onto the service until some time later this year, according to estimates from Eigen Labs.

42418420,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgxkD,1712906482,"Hong Kong-Listed Bitcoin ETFs Could Unlock Up to $25B in Demand, Crypto Firm Says","Mainland Chinese investors could pour $25 billion in potential Hong Kong-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through the Southbound Stock Connect program, according to Matrixport.  One Hong Kong-based observer said mainland Chinese funds have been applying to issue spot ETFs through their Hong Kong subsidiaries.  Hong Kong, one of the world’s leading financial centers and a gateway for outbound Chinese investments, is set to approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund tied to bitcoin (BTC).  The investment vehicle could unlock up to $25 billion in demand from Chinese investors via the Southbound Stock Connect program, according to Singapore-based crypto services provider Matrixport. The Southbound Stock Connect allows qualified mainland Chinese investors to access eligible shares listed in Hong Kong.  “A likely approval of Hong Kong-listed Bitcoin Spot ETFs could attract several billion dollars of capital as mainland investors take advantage of the Southbound Connect program, which facilitates up to 500 billion RMB (HK$540 billion and $70 billion] per year in transactions,"" Matrixport said in a report Friday.  “Based on the (potential) available capacity, this might result in up to 200 billion Hong Kong dollars of available capacity for those HK Bitcoin ETFs—or US$25 billion,"" Matrixport added.  The estimate is based on a blue sky assumption that the average amount of the unused annual Southbound connect quota over the past three years would be channeled into the spot ETFs.  The Stock Connect program allows mainland Chinese investors to snap up HK$540 billion worth of Chinese stocks annually. However, flows in the past three years have been HK$450 billion, HK$400 billion and HK$320 billion, falling short of the limit by HK$100 to HK$200 billion ($15 billion to $25 billion), according to data source 360MarketIQ.  ""Hence there is potentially HK$100 billion to HK$200 billion in quota left for bitcoin ETF investment flows – if the approval occurs without any restrictions. HK$200 is the equivalent of $25 billion,"" Matrixport explained.  As of this writing, it's unclear whether the impending spot ETFs will be open for mainland Chinese investors. That said, mainland China seems interested in diversifying into alternative assets, as evidenced by the recent surge in gold prices in Shanghai.  The tightly controlled Chinese renminbi (or yuan) has declined nearly 2% against the U.S. dollar, extending the two-year losing streak on the back of an economic slowdown and shrinking trade surplus.  ""China’s RMB is at a 17-year low vs. the USD. Indeed, there is a demand for diversification,"" Matrixport said, noting the Chinese central bank's continued gold purchases.  Nick Ruck, COO of ContentFi Labs, said mainland funds are interested in issuing ETFs in Hong Kong.  ""Mainland-based funds have been applying to issue spot bitcoin ETFs through their Hong Kong subsidiaries. If approved, this could allow qualified mainland investors greater access to bitcoin,"" Ruck, who is based on Hong Kong, told CoinDesk.  According to Nikkei Asia, top Chinese fund manager Bosera Asset Management's Hong Kong arm, Harvest Global Investments, and Chinese brokerage GF Holdings-owned Value Partners have applied for ETFs in Hong Kong.  In December, a report by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) said the Stock Connect program was expanded to include Hong Kong-listed ETFs in July 2022.

Trading Volume Plunges Over 70%,"Bucking the trend within the highly volatile memecoin sector, Bonk (BONK), a Solana-native meme token, has exhibited a bearish bias despite prevailing bullish sentiment across the broader memecoin market. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Surpasses 4 Million Addresses, Ignites Frenzy Recent data from CoinMarketCap reveals a staggering 25% price decline for Bonk over the past month, a stark contrast to the general upward trajectory witnessed across the meme coin landscape during the same period. At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.00002166, down 1.93% and 1.40% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from CMC shows. Traders Grapple With Uncertainty In Bonk’s Derivatives Market In the derivatives market, where traders speculate on the future price movements of assets, Bonk’s futures open interest has witnessed a dramatic decline, plummeting by a staggering 60% since early March, as reported by data from Coinglass. This sharp downturn in open interest reflects a significant reduction in the number of contracts or positions held by traders, indicative of diminishing interest and confidence in Bonk’s prospects among derivative traders. Despite the pronounced downturn in futures open interest, the funding rate across various cryptocurrency exchanges has managed to maintain a positive stance. This funding rate, which reflects the cost of holding long positions relative to short positions, suggests that some traders are still maintaining optimism and are unwilling to entirely abandon the possibility of an impending uptrend in Bonk’s price. BONKUSD trading at $0.000021on the daily chart: TradingView.com However, the conflicting signals between technical indicators and market sentiment leave traders grappling with uncertainty, unsure whether to hold onto their positions or cut their losses. The 30-day period under review has seen a significant fall in Bonk’s daily trading volume, with Santiment’s data indicating a 75% decrease. This decline in trading activity adds further weight to the bearish sentiment surrounding the coin, signaling waning investor interest and confidence in its potential. Source: Santiment Technical Indicators Signal Trouble For Bonk Further exacerbating Bonk’s woes are its momentum indicators, which reveal a troubling discrepancy between distribution and accumulation. The Money Flow Index (MFI) points to increased selling activity, outweighing any attempts at buying and adding further downward pressure on the coin’s value. Related Reading: CEO Throws Cold Water On May Ethereum ETF Approval – Impact On Price As the market grapples with these conflicting signals, the spotlight remains firmly fixed on Bonk and its ability to weather the storm. With its MACD line sinking below the signal and zero lines, signaling a weakening short-term trend compared to its longer-term outlook, traders are faced with a critical decision point. A Glimmer Of Hope Amidst The Storm As traders continue to monitor the situation closely, there is potential for a shift in sentiment that could breathe new life into Bonk’s ailing price. For now, the road ahead for Bonk remains uncertain, with technical indicators pointing towards further declines while traders cling to hopes of a reversal.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $10.25 on the 4-hour chart of the UNI/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might recover but the upsides might be limited above $10.00. UNI Price Takes Hit After the SEC news, UNI started a major decline. There was an increase in selling pressure on Uniswap below the $12.00 pivot level. The price declined over 15% and traded below the $10.00 support. It also increased some pressure on Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was also a drop below the $9.20 level. The price traded as low as $8.72 and it is still showing many bearish signs. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $10.25 on the 4-hour chart of the UNI/USD pair.

It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $11.79 swing high to the $8.72 low. The next key resistance is near the $10.25 level or the trend line. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $11.79 swing high to the $8.72 low. Source: UNIUSD on TradingView.com A close above the $10.25 level could open the doors for more gains in the near term. The next key resistance could be near $11.80, above which the bulls are likely to aim a test of the $12.00 level. Any more gains might send UNI toward $13.50. More Losses In Uniswap?

42418404,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgxWn,1712894400,Ethena Labs Divides Opinion as High Yield Stirs Memories of Terra,"Ethena Labs' USDe stablecoin provides a yield through a tokenized cash-and-carry trade.  Counterparty risk and a funding-rates reversal are two of the protocol's main challenges.  Ethena founder Guy Young labeled comparisons with Terra's failed UST as a ""weak, surface-level argument.""  Ethena Labs, a decentralized protocol centered on the yield-bearing USDe stablecoin, has polarized crypto traders in the weeks since introducing the token to the public in February over similarities to the Terra ecosystem, which imploded in 2021.  People who stake USDe for a minimum of seven days currently earn an annualized yield of about 37%, high enough to spur total value locked (TVL) on the protocol to $2.3 billion from $178 million – a 12-fold increase in just 60 days. High yield, however, is a double-edged sword and usually reflects high risk: Terra's UST paid out nearly 20% to stakers before its demise.  Unlike asset-backed stablecoins like tether (USDT) and USDC, whose value is secured against dollars or dollar-equivalents such as U.S. government debt, USDe calls itself a synthetic stablecoin with its $1 value maintained through a financial technique known as the cash-and-carry trade. The trade, which involves buying an asset and simultaneously shorting a derivative of the asset to collect the funding rate, or the difference between the two prices, is well known in traditional finance and doesn't carry directional, or delta, risk.  ""The trade itself is very safe and well understood, many folks (including Folkvang) have been running trades like this for years,"" Folkvang founder Mike van Rossum said in a post on X. ""But keep in mind it’s only risk free when talking about delta. There are a lot of things that can go wrong here. Such as any issue with any of the exchanges these positions (and collateral) are managed on. As well as issues around trying to execute hundreds of millions (or billions) in very volatile markets.""  How does Ethena work?  Ethena users mint USDe tokens by depositing stablecoins like USDT, dai (DAI) and USDC on the protocol. They can then stake the minted USDe, which has a market cap of $21.3 billion, in return for the yield.  To generate that yield, Ethena has deployed several strategies that hinge around the cash-and-carry trade.  Funding rates on bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} perpetuals are currently positive, which means long positions pay short positions, generating a return for those shorting the market. Funding rates typically flip negative in falling markets, which means Ethena's yield source might dry up if cryptocurrency enters another bearish cycle.  Crypto whales seem unperturbed. Earlier this week 10 wallets withdrew a total of $51 million of Ethena's native governance token (ENA) from exchanges and locked that on Ethena for a minimum of seven days, according to Lookonchain.  ""The risks to Ethena is that the yield goes away due to natural market forces, or that they have a counterparty blow up, not the collateral itself,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, said in an interview.  ""What Ethena is trying to do with basis trades is fairly easy, and has been done in traditional markets for decades,"" he said. ""Anyone can do the same thing on their own, if they have enough capital for collateral, and trusted counterparties. All Ethena is doing is increasing the risk while decreasing the time it takes for you to do it on your own.""  Long-lasting scars  Terra's traumatic demise led to the bankruptcy of several other crypto firms, and left long-lasting scars across the industry. It blew up because UST, an algorithmic stablecoin, entered a death spiral following aggressive selling and a slump in the value of LUNA, which acted as collateral.  ""It is a really weak, surface-level argument to compare what Ethena is doing to Luna,"" Ethena Labs founder Guy Young said in an interview with Laura Shin on the Unchained podcast. ""The core difference here is thinking about what's backing the stable asset. So UST was backed by the LUNA token, which mooned up 100% and dumped 50% in a week. Ethena's USD is fully backed and fully collateralized.""  As for its reliance on a bull market, Young said: ""I think it's a valid concern around this. What we did see even in 2022 when you had staked ETH together with basis you could still sustain rates above U.S. Treasuries, but I do imagine that in a bear market you do see a reasonable unwind of USDe supply.""  ""This is something that we're okay with,"" Young said. ""It's just something that is responding to market dynamics, and if there is less leverage demand to be long as the interest rate is lower, we're going to adjust to a smaller size.""  Young didn't rule out changing Ethena's yield-generation strategy to something that ""makes sense in a bear market"" if necessary.",NEUTRAL,LUNA | ENA,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING | ENA,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/11/ethena-labs-divides-opinion-as-high-yield-stirs-memories-of-terra,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7b078d7d53380132ebefb9522cacc0f432c22d9-1786x1004.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The judgment was handed down by US District Judge Lewis Kaplan during a hearing in a Lower Manhattan federal courtroom on March 28. Bankman-Fried, who had publicly announced plans to appeal the conviction, has now officially filed an objection to the decision. ‘Remorse And Empathy’ For FTX Customers During the sentencing hearing, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan leveled serious accusations against Bankman-Fried, including perjury and evasiveness during his testimony. The judge expressed disappointment in Bankman-Fried’s lack of regret for the crimes committed. Related Reading: XRP Sees An Alarming 1,800% Surge In Liquidations, Whats Going On? In response, Bankman-Fried expressed remorse and empathy for the “thousands of customers” who suffered financial losses. He acknowledged his responsibility as CEO of FTX and expressed desire to repair the damage caused. Bankman-Fried expressed frustration at the loss of what he had achieved and his limited ability to improve the situation from prison. Despite his efforts, he acknowledged the constraints that limited his ability to do more. Sam Bankman-Fried Alleges Trial Unfairness In a post-conviction interview, Bankman-Fried expressed concerns about the fairness of his trial, specifically targeting Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm representing FTX’s new owners. The disgraced FTX co-founder accused the law firm of colluding with the prosecution and obstructing his access to key FTX documents shared with the prosecution. Bankman-Fried claimed that this had a detrimental effect on the entire trial, including media coverage and the defense’s ability to present evidence in his favor. With the official appeal now filed, Bankman-Fried is seeking a different outcome, hoping for a reduced sentence. He emphasized the importance of introducing crucial evidence and presenting key witnesses, which he claims his defense was denied the opportunity to do during the trial. Currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, Bankman-Fried has been particularly vocal about his desire to remain in the MDC-Brooklyn jail pending the outcome of his appeal.

In particular, Brandt has noted a descending triangle pattern forming on Solana’s 4-hour price chart. Related Reading: Paradigm Drives $225M Funding Round For Monad Labs, Blockchain Rival To Ethereum, Solana Identified Chart Pattern On SOL And Its Implications The descending triangle pattern identified by lower highs and a horizontal support line is often interpreted in technical analysis as a signal of a potential downtrend continuation. Brandt’s recent post highlighted the completion of this pattern, drawing attention to a crucial development for SOL traders. Brandt’s analysis extends beyond the mere identification of the pattern. He underscores the significance of pattern validation over its completion. According to Brandt, a pattern’s failure to fulfill its expected role carries more weight than its mere completion. With the descending triangle pattern now confirmed for SOL, market participants’ anticipation is palpable as they await potential price movements, whether to the upside or downside.

Despite a 12.7% decline in SOL’s value over the past week, there has been a slight uptick of 4% in the last 24 hours. However, ongoing network congestion has presented obstacles. Solana developers are actively addressing these issues, with efforts underway to resolve network congestion experienced on April 15. Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs, a key contributor to Solana’s maintenance and enhancement, clarified that the current network challenges stem from implementing a specific protocol rather than an inherent design flaw in Solana. solana’s current issue is not a design flaw, it’s an implementation bug it is now hitting me that some folks might not understand what we’ve been trying to say by this for the past week I’ll simplify it (intended for non-technical people) it is important to make this… pic.twitter.com/fNZzu9f90S — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) April 8, 2024 Meanwhile, Solana’s open interest in the futures sector, a metric used in derivatives markets referring to the total number of outstanding contracts, has experienced fluctuations in recent times. While it saw steady growth from January to April, reaching an all-time high of $2.86 billion on April 1, recent network issues have led to a decline. Coinglass data indicates that Solana’s open interest has fallen to $2.4 billion since April 11, reflecting a 5% decline in just over a week.

25588949,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602699,1712880321,The Era Of Flippenings: Can Dogecoin Take XRP’s Spot?,"In the last few weeks, there has been uncertainty in the crypto market, but that has not stopped the likes of Dogecoin and XRP from making moves. One of the most notable developments, however, was the entry of Toncoin (TON) into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, and then dethroning Cardano (ADA). Following this, Dogecoin looks ready to carry out a flippening of its own, eyeing XRP’s spot on the list. Dogecoin Gearing Up To Take Over XRP Dogecoin has performed rather well at a time when the crypto market has remained indecisive. Even though there has been times when the price has dipped, it has managed to reclaim $0.2, although the majority of bearish resistance is being mounted at this junction. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Drops Trading Strategy To Profit Off Shiba Inu’s Next Leg Up Above $0.00003 Nevertheless, Dogecoin’s ability to hold most of its gains from March has seen its market cap increase rapidly. From less than $15 billion at the start of the year 2024, the meme coin’s market cap has now climbed above $28.6 billion, putting it dangerously close to the market cap of XRP. At the time of writing, XRP’s market cap is sitting at $33.9 billion, spurred by the decline in its price over the last week. This means that the market cap of XRP is now only 15.6% higher than that of Dogecoin, a perilously small gap given how quickly prices of cryptocurrencies can rise. In this case, if Dogecoin continues to perform well and XRP fails to keep up, it could easily lose the sixth spot on the list to DOGE. A 20% rise in the DOGE price to $0.24 would put its market cap above $34 billion, putting it ahead of XRP. And if XRP’s continues to fall, then the gap could tighten over the next week. DOGE Price Projected To Explode Dogecoin currently boasts one of the strongest crypto communities, and some would argue even stronger than the XRP army, as DOGE’s support base has strengthened due to its outperformance in the past. This support base and rapid adoption are two of the foremost factors that promise an interesting future for the meme coin. Related Reading: Here Are The Drivers Behind The Bitcoin Price Crash To $68,000 There have been many predictions for where the future price of DOGE might be, with some going as high as $100. However, according to crypto Analyst Ali Martinez, Dogecoin could do quite well in this bull market. The analysis posted by Martinez reveals multiple price targets, with $12 at the top. These targets, if they play out correctly, will see the DOGE market cap rise rapidly, and unless XRP pulls some equally bullish moves, it will soon be behind DOGE on the list of largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. But for now, both cryptocurrencies at maintaining their places with XRP in 6th position and Dogecoin in 8th position behind stablecoin USDC.
