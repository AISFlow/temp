42377823,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73ilN,1416524140,Gavin Andresen: Bitcoin Foundation Pivot Won't Centralize Core Development,"Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen has publicly voiced his support for the organisation's plan to focus solely on core development.  In a new blog posthttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/11/strengthening-the-core/, Andresen defended prior efforts to support core development and stated that the Bitcoin Foundation is just one of several organizations that provide funding for the oversight of the bitcoin protocol.  The statements follow the Bitcoin Foundation's formal announcement of the plan, which will find it shedding its education, public policy and outreach operations, as well as the healthy debate about the organization's pivot that has played out over social media channels.  Andresen cited bitcoin payments processor BitPay and sidechains developer Blockstream as key sources of support, as well as bitcoin brokerage provider Trucoin, which gave direct support in 2012. Between the two companies and the Bitcoin Foundation, direct funding is provided to a group that includes Andresen, as well as developers Cory Fields, Gregory Maxwell, Jeff Garzik, Pieter Wuille and Wladimir van der Laan.  Andresen argued that such efforts keep bitcoin core development decentralized by maintaining separate sources of funding for maintaining and improving the reference code for bitcoin. Beyond this, he said, the funding enables the creation of new innovations for the protocol from both the funded core team and the scores of other volunteer bitcoin developers.  Andresen continued:  “Eliminating single points of failure is one of the key concepts that makes bitcoin such a reliable system, and I’m very happy that we have multiple, independent organizations supporting core development.”  Andresen said 259 developers have contributed work to the Core code – with nearly 7,400 commits between them all, according to GitHub – and that the thousands of derivative projects from that source code are indicative of the decentralized nature of digital currency progression.  Call to arms  As part of its focus on bitcoin core development, the Bitcoin Foundation is hoping to provide funding to more developers to meet security and code assessment needs. Andresen suggested that the Bitcoin Foundation is preparing to hire a new development-focused security specialist, saying that it hopes to make such an announcement “very soon”.  Andresen said that the Bitcoin Foundation is in need of a developer with an interest in “deep, thorough testing of the core code”, explaining:  “Somebody [who] understands bitcoin deeply who will write test plans and then beg or bribe or hire people to run those tests. Ideally, somebody who can also write regression tests to automate testing.”  This echoes previous comments by Andresen, who in the past has said that a key weakness in core development is the lack of testing resources.  Noting that the Bitcoin Foundation can’t afford to make such a hire in the near-term, he urged those interested to get involved with code testing and added that “if you do a good job you’ll be the first person hired when we can"".

42377831,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73ivR,1416516363,Chinese Bitcoin Mining Alliance Denounces Ponzi Schemes in Transparency Push,"A consortium of major bitcoin mining companies has pledged to be more transparent in its operations, specifically on the source of cloud mining payouts.  Including major China-based bitcoin mining firms ASICMiner, Gridseed, Rockminer, XBTec and ZeusMiner, the group boasts that the partnership has resulted in the “the strongest alliance ever in cloud mining history”, according to the official announcement.  The move follows previous cooperative efforts between the companies, which are moving to provide greater support to one another in the face of increasing international competition. Last month, the companies involved in the new alliance – with the exception of Gridseed – pledged greater cooperation in the increasingly competitive mining product marketplace.  In the statement, members of the group promised to keep customers informed about both the source of their hashing power and how the coins that are paid out to miners are generated. In the later case, the companies resolved to be more transparent about whether such coins originate from mining blocks or other forms of income.  The group wrote:  “We, the alliance, have taken an oath to become more and more transparent in future, opening up to the public and our customers to show everyone that we have actual honest hashing power behind our cloud hashing.”  The companies also called on other firms in the cloud mining space to join them in their transparency bid.  While not specifically naming any other companies, the announcement states that the group believes there are mining entities on the market that ""pretend to mine coins but run Ponzi schemes"" or may be operating in violation of securities regulations.  Need for honesty  According to the announcement, those involved intend to take steps to improve transparency efforts in a bid to assuage fears that the cloud mining business model represents a high risk to potential investors.  Such concerns have been voiced by a number of prominent figures in the digital currency space who have questioned the integrity – and solvency – of cloud mining providers.  The announcement explained:  “In the course of the next weeks, we will deliver proof that our cloud hashing is based on actual mining. Only by being transparent and honest we will build a sustainable future for all of us. We owe this to everyone in the cloud mining community.”  Rockminer representative Alex Lam told CoinDesk that he believes it is important for companies in the industry to acknowledge the issues that can arise from a lack of transparency. Citing what he called a broad shift shift from home-based mining to hosted solutions, Lam argued that ultimately, the effort is to get more people supporting digital currencies.  “We will never stop promoting mining to people,” he said.

42377835,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73ixx,1416508225,Mozilla Now Accepting Bitcoin in Response to User Demand,"Mozilla, the open-source development community behind the popular Firefox web browser, is now accepting bitcoin donations.  The Mozilla Foundation  , the non-profit entity that provides support for the community’s broad open-source development, will be partnering with Coinbase to accept bitcoin contributions. The California-based bitcoin services provider announced the deal on its blog, where it reinforced that, per its policies toward charities, it will not charge fees for the donations it processes.  With the news, Mozilla joins the growing number of non-profit organizations that support open-source and free Web-focused initiatives, including the Wikimedia Foundation, that are accepting bitcoin. In recent months, charitable organizations around the world have slowly begun to turn to digital currency to facilitate donations while removing costs associated with legacy payment methods.  The announcement followed a post on the bitcoin subreddit that asked why the Mozilla Foundation had yet to embrace bitcoin donations.  According to Mozilla vice president Geoffrey MacDougall, who posted a link to the donation page in response, the long-awaited move came after what he called a robust internal process focused on security and compliance.  MacDougall noted:  “We're a large organization and it takes us a while to move things through legal, privacy and security review. There were a lot of steps to getting this in place, but we got it done.”  The move comes more than a year after Mozilla first broached the idea of accepting bitcoin.  At the time, MacDougall took steps to open a dialogue with the bitcoin Reddit community and commented that “there are a number of people on my team” advocating for bitcoin donations.  The Mozilla donations page was operational at press time, though some users had reported difficulties accessing the page earlier in the day.

42377827,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73iqP,1416506076,UK Shadow Minister Outlines Bitcoin's Potential for Disruption,"Bitcoin has the potential to reduce consumers' reliance on giant banks and other entrenched financial institutions, according to Chi Onwurah, the UK's shadow cabinet minister for digital government.  Onwurah is leading a sweeping review of how technology is used by UK public services for the opposition party, Labour. The review includes examining institutions dealing with financial services, she said.  Speaking exclusively to CoinDesk, Onwurah said:  ""It's about dispersing power away from the classic, traditional financial institutions ... the public has lost trust in them, for some very good reasons. I think bitcoin and digital currencies are really an opportunity for currency to ... be back in the hands of those who use it.""  As the UK heads toward a general election in May, Labour leads the incumbent Conservative party in opinion polls, which has been the case for much of the last two and a half years. Onwurah is likely to be appointed to the cabinet if Labour forms the new government.  A new UK government's regulatory approach  A Labour government would not rush into developing regulations around bitcoin and digital currencies in general, Onwurah said. Instead, she advocated a wait-and-see approach to digital currency regulation to ensure innovation isn't stifled too early in the growth of the sector.  ""It's a new and emerging market, I think you would be highly critical if we were to set out now exactly how the market should be regulated. Clearly, existing regulation applies,"" she said.  Against the backdrop of an economy still reeling from the 2008 financial crisis, the shadow minister framed the rise of digital currencies as an example of how outmoded financial institutions have become.  She added:  ""It's clear that in many ways, we are using institutions from the 20th century to address the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century.""  Onwurah lauds the role digital currencies could play in fundamentally changing the way finance works.  ""You see digital in other value-chains make big differences: in travel, in media. But it hasn't really changed the model that much, it's just that the intermediaries have gone. Whereas when you see digital technology getting into currency, that can inspire real change in power relationships,"" she said.  Consumer protections paramount  Bitcoin believers hoping for a light touch from a Labour government next year will likely be disappointed, however. Onwurah emphasised the need for consumer protections, particularly in Internet-enabled financial services.  ""Those who argue there is no need for government regulation or protection because we've got the Internet in the middle of the market do not understand the vulnerabilities of consumers,"" she said.  Onwurah should know a thing or two about consumer protections. An electrical engineer by training, she spent more than 12 years developing products at telcos Cable and Wireless and Nortel. She then headed telecoms and technology strategy at Ofcom, the UK's telecoms and broadcasting regulator, for five years.  After her time at Ofcom, Onwurah entered politics, getting elected as member of parliament for Newcastle Central in 2010. She was made shadow minister for digital government last November.  In the UK, Shadow ministers are opposition politicians who monitor the performance and policies of ministers from the ruling party. They are often appointed to the cabinet if their party wins power, although this is not guaranteed.  Onwurah has offered public support for a campaign by Transferwise, the London startup that offers peer-to-peer transfers in the foreign-exchange markets. Nearly 15,000 people have signed the online petition it launched yesterday asking UK regulators to make banks publish money-transfer fees levied on consumers.  UK's bitcoin-friendly stance  The UK government has adopted an open posture towards bitcoin so far. The most visible move has come from Chancellor George Osborne, who launched a Treasury study of bitcoin this year in a bid to turn Britain into a ""global centre of financial innovation"".  The right regulations could make the UK a prime jurisdiction for bitcoin businesses, putting it in a position to scoop up global companies seeking regulatory certainty. Firms based in the US, which accounts for the lion's share of venture capital invested in the digital currency space, still await clarity from New York's financial regulator over its 'BitLicense' proposal, which is due next year.  Meanwhile, venture capital is pouring into bitcoin startups in Europe, with a 60% jump in funds invested, or $49m, in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous quarter, according to the CoinDesk State of Bitcoin report. Two of the most well funded companies in the field, Coinbase and BitPay, began competing for European merchants and consumers this year.  Onwurah is largely in agreement with Osborne's financial technology push, although she downplayed the centrality of digital currencies in that effort, noting that they were just one of many forms of FinTech.  ""FinTech is somewhere that we should be leading. There are many different forms of innovation in financial services ... we certainly don't want a market strangled by the very big players we have, so the opportunities for innovation are significant,"" she said.

42377838,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73j1j,1416502910,Realcoin Rebrands as 'Tether' to Avoid Altcoin Association,"Realcoin has officially announced it will rebrand as 'Tether' as it opens for private beta.  First revealed in July, the Isle of Man and Hong Kong-based company said the name change is an attempt to better express its true functionality as a crypto 2.0 project that uses tokens to move currencies over the blockchain.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Reeve Collins emphasized this line of reasoning, stating:  ""We're not an altcoin, we're not our own blockchain. We're a service, a token that represents dollars. Our speciality at Tether is currencies on the blockchain, so Tether means a digital tie to a real-world asset and the digital assets that we're focused on is currencies.""  In addition to the strategic repositioning, Tether also announced new partnerships in the bitcoin space, including agreements with Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, as well as fellow Brock Pierce-backed startups Expresscoin, GoCoin and ZenBox.  ""Our angle to potential partners is, it doesn't cost any money and it makes your service more robust, as you can now offer currency as well as bitcoin. You can offer crypto as well as real-world currencies, so we're hoping it will be widely accepted,"" Collins added.  To begin, Tether will utilize the Mastercoin protocol, an exchange layer built on top of bitcoin that allows for asset exchange. Tether co-founder Craig Sellars also notably serves as the chief technology officer for Mastercoin.  Dollars on the blockchain  Tether is the latest and perhaps most high-profile project to attempt to use the blockchain's functionality as a ledger to move digital tokens that represent real currency.  For example, early crypto 2.0 platform BitShares has notably launched BitShares X, a family of decentralised autonomous companies (DACs) that issued its asset-backed token, BitUSD.  Collins positioned Tether as a more simplistic solution than those offered by its competitors, noting that its offerings, USTether (US+), EuroTether (EU+) and YenTether (JP+) cease to exist when they are redeemed with the service.  ""These assets are created and destroyed on the fly. These are purely digital dollars. This is just representing dollars in our bank account,"" Collins explained.  Collins indicated that the number of Tether tokens in circulation will always equate to the dollars in its bank account, adding that there are no pegs or formulas that complicate the process for its partners.  ""When you want to redeem them, we issue you cash,"" he said.  USTether, Collins suggested, will be available immediately to those accepted into the beta, while EuroTether and YenTether will be ""done very soon"".  Foundational ecosystem layer  Collins went on to express his hope that Tether would become a foundational component of the bitcoin ecosystem, one that gains traction due to the stability of its tokens.  ""It's simply a dollar that works on the blockchain, and works with all [our clients'] services,"" Collins continued. ""Their services work with bitcoin and now they can work with Tether.""  Eventually, Collins explained Tether will seek to make money by charging a small fee to issue tokens, but noted that it intends to maximize the volume of these assets to keep costs for clients low.  ""If we're controlling billions of dollars in circulation, then we'll make a half a percent, we'll invest that money,"" he said.  For the long term, Collins suggested that Tether hopes to grow to form the backbone of government-backed cryptocurrencies, the blockchain-based alternatives to projects like Ecuador's planned digital dollar and the proposed E-Peso project in the Philippines.

42377829,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73ip9,1416494584,Huobi's BitVC Uses Trader Profits to Cover Futures Loss,"UPDATE (November 20th 16:01 GMT): Alongsideits plan to pool 20% of all trading fees into a 'system reserve fund', Huobi informed CoinDesk it has now reimbursed all users who suffered from its ""system loss allocation policy"" in the form of credit for future trading fees.  ""BitVC will continue working toward our goal of providing a fair, transparent and stable trading platform, and we always welcome user feedback and suggestions,"" the platform added.      BitVC, the digital currency futures trading platform owned by exchange Huobi, found itself on the receiving end of customer anger last week when it took 46.1% of traders' profits from the week to cover a ""system loss"" of over 3,000 BTC.  The loss raises questions about whether cryptocurrency exchange platforms have the liquidity to support sophisticated trading features such as margin lending and derivatives, and whether they are using the correct mechanisms to deal with unusual events.  It also highlights how bitcoin's price volatility can bring surprises in a world of highly leveraged trading and the 'socialized' sharing of losses between trading winners.  Huobi  's/BitVC's solution, to take the total loss (worth over $1.17m today) out of its users' profits for that week and reimburse the funds in the form of trading fees, prompted instant outrage on various social media forums such as weibo, QQ and Reddit.  Single trader brought losses  According to an official statement by Huobi, an initial loss of 2,500 BTC was the result of an individual trader who on 14th November opened a highly leveraged long position of 40m CNY at a BTC price of 3,000 CNY, only to be forced into liquidation at a lower price (2817.76) when the market took a sharp dive.  Even the forced liquidation price was unattainable, however, since the price at the time was falling fast. The trader's position could only be fully closed at a price averaging 2378.72 CNY, resulting in the system loss. In total, BitVC's futures contract system lost 3032.3848 BTC over the week.  Hong Kong-registered BitVC launched in June with margin trading and interest-bearing accounts for CNY holders. Its futures platform has been operating since September.  On its futures exchange BitVC offers 5x and 20x leverage. On its regular margin trading platform the firm allows a maximum leveragehttps://www.bitvc.com/help/detail?id=46 of twice a user's total assets (in BTC/LTC/CNY) up to a maximum limit of 5m CNY, 500 BTC or 10,000 LTC.  Proposing future solutions  ""We understand that this level of loss allocation is unacceptable,"" Huobi posted on Reddit, as it promised to reimburse users' lost profits with exchange fee credits.  Huobi/BitVC proposed a new system to protect traders from similar events in future, which would see 20% of all trading fees collected pooled into a 'system reserve fund' that would cover any system losses first, before they are passed proportionally onto users.  The company also promised to ""improve the futures exchange rules, liquidation process, and transparency, including publishing forced liquidation orders and other relevant data in real time"".  Not all trader reactions were negative, however, with one Reddit user responding:  ""It's called counterparty risk ... If you take 46% of the list you posted, you only have 1700 BTC. People are trading futures without having a clue what it is.""  Indeed, unexpected losses on leveraged currency trading are not unique to bitcoin or digital currencies, and are even the norm in the traditional ForEx world, as Bloomberg recently pointed out.  High leverages bring risk  Representatives from other derivatives exchanges in and outside China have stepped forward with opinions on leverage and system losses. Should traders just expect incidents like last week's, or are there other ways to manage them?  Arthur Hayes, CEO of soon-to-launch platform BitMEX, told CoinDesk the recent price volatility exposed how big the 'tax' on winners profits could be on some exchanges.  He said:  ""I think some traders (at BitVC) read the terms and traded in full knowledge, and some were quite surprised when they got a big hefty tax.""  Hayes pointed out that similar exchanges such as 796.com and OKCcoin took 25.01% and 5.15% out of their own winning traders' profits respectively in the same week ending 14th November, to deal with 'System Assumed Counterparty Loss'.  OKCoin offers up to 20x leverage to margin traders, saying ""with this increased leverage, we urge investors to manage their risk carefully"".  796's settlement history page details exactly what the loss and 'profit socialized' amounts have been over time and indicates that, on at least two other occasions, they have been percentages in double figures.  Comparing these kinds of settlements to a casino that tries to tax its winners' payouts, Hayes said the products turned spread trading into a dangerous game unsuitable for businesses hedging real-world currency risks.  Counterparty risk is a big issue, he continued, and many exchanges use part of the trading fees to cover this risk, not a tax on winnings. Much of the risk lay with the high leverages being offered, which are up to 20x.  ""With 20x leverage, bankruptcy is only a 5% move away. This is incredibly risky on contracts that can move as much as 20% in a day. These exchanges then enjoy the increased fees gained by their increased leverage and offload the risk onto their users. It may seem that fees are low, but at 20x leverage, 0.2% becomes a 4% fee. Many in the bitcoin community have not noticed.""  Design can be an issue  Jeremy Glaros is the co-founder of Coinarch, a derivatives platform which offers leveraged products such as 'Booster' and allows users to lend bitcoin to traders in return for interest.  Noting that he was speaking about exchanges in general and not any company or incident in particular, he said problems with leveraged trading in bitcoin are the result of fundamental product design flaws rather than a ""rampant market"" issue.  Different providers in the bitcoin space employed different mechanisms for dealing with these situations, he said.  While limited market depth does result in sharp price moves and quick position close-outs, the design of some markets means that if markets move a long way, and winners win big on paper, profits are going to be significantly pared back.  ""The problem exists because traders can take very high leverage and nominate that their losses be capped at their initial margin (as little as 5% in some cases). This means that losers' losses are almost never going to be sufficiently covered by the margin they post unless the market moves by only a small amount (eg: less than 5%), in which case the wins would not be that big anyway, so a pare-back is not of great concern.""  No major asset class over which futures are available, Glaros continued, includes anything like this feature in its contracts. Usually, if a futures trader is losing and does not put up the additional margin required to keep a position open, the exchange itself will take over that position as principal to ensure its other futures contracts are made good.  Whatever risks it takes from doing so are offloaded onto another market participant who assumes the position, with any losses absorbed by the exchange.  Cautionary tale for traders  While no one has suggested any wrongdoing or illegal behavior on any exchange's part, these incidents and issues serve as a warning for bitcoin holders new to the world of trading to study hard before jumping in with the professionals.  Leveraged trading experience with a decent track record, plus an understanding of sensible losing techniques, is a minimum requirement.  Even for those with years of financial world experience, bitcoin may provide new quirks and they need to understand completely the kind of margin policies their chosen platforms are offering.

42377842,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73j81,1416488502,Mining Roundup: Bitmain's Mining Pool Push and a HashFast Auction,"What’s happening in the world of cryptocurrency mining?  Recent reports indicate that despite the shift among some to the cloud, hardware development remains a priority among the major players in the space.  At the other end of the spectrum, the industry continues to face headwinds on the legal and developmental front.  The network hashrate numbers (via Blockchain) from recent weeks suggest that the network hashing strength is fluctuating after reaching an all-time high on or around 1st November. Peaking then at approximately 340 PH/s, the network at press time is at roughly 288 PH/s.  Will this trend continue or will the network hashrate continue its long-term march upwards? Only time will tell.  GAWMiners announces further delay to Vaultbreaker ASIC  GAWMiners has announced a new delay in the development of its Vaultbreaker series of scrypt ASICs, saying that the company originally contracted to built the machines has gone out of business.  According to a forum post from last week, the company concerned ceased operations two months ago and GAWMiners subsequently contracted a new partner to build the ASICs. It did not name either of the companies involved with the development of the ASIC.  The firm said that it is offering in-stock hardware to interested pre-order customers with equivalent hash rates, noting that 90 percent of pre-order customers opted to exchange their orders for cloud services instead. All told, according to GAW, only 5 percent of customers were affected by the delay.  GAWMiners CEO Josh Garza told CoinDesk that the company opted not to make the announcement sooner because it was “not appropriate”, arguing that “there was no upside in making those guys look bad, when just about all our customers ended up with something even better” – a reference to the company’s cloud mining service.  Garza added that follow-up conversations with Vaultbreaker pre-order customers have been positive and that some customers expressed an interest in exchanging their orders for cloud-hashing power instead of older equipment.  The move represents another roadblock for the development of so-called third generation scrypt mining hardware.  Last month, ZeusMiner announced that it was ceasing development of its Volcano scrypt ASIC. At the time, CEO Terry Li noted that growing demand among miners for cloud hashing power was a major factor in its decision.  This trend is not without controversy, however. On forums and social media platforms, some have criticized the move by formerly hardware-focused mining companies to shift to cloud-based solutions.  Concerns about the viability of these business models have been noted by prominent community members, and critics say that relative declines in both bitcoin and altcoin markets will make it difficult for some investors to achieve a return on their investment in the long term.  Bitmain launches new mining pool  Chinese bitcoin mining company Bitmain has opened a new mining pool called Antpool, which launched on 16th November and has maintained an average of 16-17 PH/s since then.  According to data from Blockchain, Antpool constitutes roughly 4% of the bitcoin network as of today – roughly the same as Slush Pool or BTC Guild.  In its announcement on the Bitcoin Talk forum, the company said that it opted to make the pool one node in the broader p2p mining protocol network in a bid to promote greater decentralization in bitcoin mining.  Bitmain noted:  “Antpool supports both solo and p2p mining protocol. Bitmain reaffirms its commitment to help decentralize the bitcoin network, strengthen the bitcoin eco-system and put the majority of hashing power into the hands of consumers.”  Bitmain said that it wants to promote community involvement in the development of the mining pool by making its modified p2pool code open source, inviting input from stakeholders.  The announcement sparked debate about whether or not the company was being forthright in contributing to the p2pool mining protocol, which enables miners to collectivize hashing power without having to rely on a centralized – and potentially fraudulent – mining structure.  Bitmain commented in subsequent posts that it is committed to p2pool development, but added that proper scaling of the network to reach enterprise levels will take time.  HashFast assets to be auctioned off next month  Bankrupt bitcoin mining company HashFast is set to have the remainder of its assets auctioned off in early December, according to a recent decision by the judge overseeing the company’s long-running legal battle.  Court documents (hat tip Ars Technica) show that US bankruptcy judge Dennis Montali approved a request for the company to begin selling off assets, including thousands of ASIC chips, as well as other kinds of computer components.  An auction is scheduled to be held on 4th December in San Francisco, with participants likely to be the company’s debtors and stakeholders who, according to court documents, are owed as much as $40m. Potential bidders have until 2nd December to submit their bids and deposits.  Notably, among the assets up for auction are “claims and causes of action” against HashFast CTO Simon Barber for alleged improprieties related to “preference, fraudulent transfer, and breach of fiduciary duty claims”.  HashFast was granted Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June after a contentious legal effort, during which the company staved off previous attempts by creditors to push it into bankruptcy. Prior to declaring bankruptcy, the company shed dozens of workers in an effort to remain solvent.  CoinDesk attempted to reach out to HashFast representatives but several email inboxes appear to be inactive. According to Ars Technica, other attempts to contact the company for comment have been unsuccessful.  Got a cryptocurrency mining tip for future roundups? Contact us.

42377830,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73isv,1416480723,SpectroCoin Launches Bitcoin-to-Cash Service in 25 Countries,"SpectroCoin is now allowing its customers to convert bitcoin into cash in 25 countries across Europe and Central Asia.  The announcement is the latest from the UK and Lithuania-based bitcoin services provider, which added merchant processing to its existing brokerage and wallet offerings in August.  Speaking to CoinDesk, SpectroCoin CEO Vytautas Karalevičius compared his company's newest service to traditional remittance offerings, emphasizing that his company intends to make extending services to the underbanked in its region a core focus.  Mantas Mockevičius, the company's chief compliance officer, explained that SpectroCoin feels its latest offering solves an immediate market need in many of the company's target areas.  Mockevičius said:  ""In some countries, they don't need it much, but in Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Armenia and lots and lots of countries, it's a very useful service because there are lots of unbanked people there, and banking infrastructure is not so developed as, say, in Europe. So a person can get funds very easy. He can actually use bitcoin as a remittance.""  In addition to those countries, bitcoin-to-cash withdrawals are now available in nations such as Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Portugal and Spain, along with Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine.  SpectroCoin charges a flat 4.5% fee for bitcoin-to-cash conversions, with a minimum fee of €3.7 (roughly 0.0123 BTC).  Cash withdrawal options  Mockevičius suggested that while SpectroCoin's bitcoin-to-cash withdrawals are not cheap when compared to bitcoin transactions, they will likely find an audience with consumers in parts of the world where moving money still costs a premium.  ""As a user, I get bitcoins from the person abroad. I convert it to cash and order the withdrawal in my country. I think it's a very useful service for people without bank accounts,"" he said.  Mockevičius illustrated how users can convert their bitcoins to euros on SpectroCoin, before entering the amount of fiat currency they want to withdraw, as well as their place of residence.  SpectroCoin, in turn, displays the end total the user will receive, minus the fee.  The user can then withdraw the cash at one of the company's partnering banks, financial institutions or post offices. In some markets, the company has direct agreements with its partners, while in others it uses third parties, Mockevičius explained.  He estimated that it may take users up to five days to receive funds, as the firm's partners must post a paper slip to the user, which must be taken to an institution to exchange for cash.  Emphasis on speed  Mockevičius also sought to stress that while its bitcoin-to-cash service may be slow, its main bitcoin wallet and brokerage services still put an emphasis on quick delivery.  ""We are a bit more expensive than other services that work through bank wire, but we are much faster,"" Mockevičius explained. ""So, if the user needs the bitcoins the same day, we can very easily provide that service. This is our target market, clients who need speed. Selling bitcoin and withdrawing to cash takes time, so it's a slightly different model.""  Still, he added, SpectroCoin is working to improve all of its services as competition in the European market has heated up following the entrance of US bitcoin heavyweights BitPay and Coinbase.  SpectroCoin has also faced criticism from some market participants for an allegedly anti-competitive market strategy and security issues. However, the company told CoinDesk that any such claims are ""comments without any evidence"".
