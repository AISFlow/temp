19992010,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559925,1699570833,Top 5 Meme Coins That Are Outperforming The Altcoin Rally,"The altcoin market rally has been the talk of the crypto community lately and it has been with good reason. Amid this rapid rise of cryptocurrencies across the board, meme coins have been doing well. But just like any asset class, there are some that have performed better than others. CorgiAI (CORGIAI) Leads Meme Coins Gains CorgiAI (CORGIAI) is an interesting take on the Dog meme coins. But instead of using the widely popular Shiba Inu breed, the project chose the Corgi breed for their purposes and this seems to be working out well. In the last day, CorgiAI has dominated meme coin gains, rising over 56% in this time. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Flatlines With 99.35% Drop, Here’s Why Its figures on the 7-day chart are even more impressive, as data from CoinGecko shows that the asset rose $86.8 in just seven days. CorgiAI is now the 11th-largest meme coin in the space after its market cap crossed $36.29 million. Bonk (BONK): The Solana Altcoin Making Waves The Solana native Bonk (BONK) coin is one of the top meme coins after a massive run earlier in 2023. In the current ‘altcoin season’, it has performed very well, rising 29% in one day. Its 7-day gains are the closest to CorgiAI at 76.7%. On the shorter time frame, ie the 1-hour chart, BONK is actually outperforming the rest of the meme coins. Its price is already up 11.3% in the last hour at the time of this writing. This could suggest a further run in the near future for the meme con. HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (ETH) BITCOIN This meme coin is an embodiment of the most ridiculous parts of crypto and how anything can surge in the market. The coin which is the combination of popularly recognized names in pop culture, politics, and crypto started rising a few months ago, garnering a healthy following while at it. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Has Entered Markup Phase, Why This Is Important It moved rapidly enough that it is now one of the largest meme coins in the space, rising 19% in the last day alone. Despite seeing 2.5% losses on the weekly chart, its market cap is still sitting at $137.76 million, making it the 7th-largest meme coin by market cap. Dogelon Mars (ELON) Maintains Prominence Among Meme Coins This meme coin named after two of the most recognizable names when it comes to meme coins (Elon Musk and Dogecoin) has persisted even through the worst bear trends, and now it is continuing to show strength. Coming just behind HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (ETH) BITCOIN, ELON has recorded daily gains of 16.7%, with weekly gains of 14.4%. It currently holds the 8th position among the largest meme coins in the space. DOGE remains king of meme coins | Source: DOGEUSDT on Tradingview.com Memecoin (MEME): New Kid On The Block Coming in 5th on this list is the newly released Memecoin (MEME). This meme coin was developed by the 9Gag team and initially saw a retracement on its launch gains. However, the tide is starting to turn as MEME’s 24-hour gains rise to 16.4%. Given that this is a new meme coin, there are currently no weekly figures. However, just like BONK, the meme coin is performing well on the hourly chart after rising 7.6% in the last hour at the time of this writing.

But that does not mean that they have not done well. As data from CoinGecko shows, all three of these cryptocurrencies are up at least 4% in the last day. DOGE has seen the lowest gains of the trio during this time with gains of 4%. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is on a higher level with 5.3% gains. PEPE is the best performer so far after rising 13.1% to reclaim the $0.0000013 level.

42392091,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0PdR,1699570792,"Ether Surges to 7-Month High, Outshines Bitcoin on BlackRock ETF Plans; Altcoins Plunge","ETH soared 10% to near $2,100 after a Nasdaq filing confirmed BlackRock's plan to file for an ETH-based ETH.  BTC recently changed hands at $36,600, up 3% during the day.  Most of the rest of cryptocurrencies suffered declines as rotation to altcoins halted amid ETH, BTC strength.  Ether [ETH] stole the spotlight from bitcoin [BTC] Thursday as asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) laid the groundwork to list an ETH exchange-traded fund.  ETH surged past $2,000 early U.S. morning hours from below $1,900 after a filing showed a corporate entity named ""iShares Ethereum Trust"" had been registered in the state of Delaware – the legal home of many U.S. businesses. Something similar happened in June with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust – the Delaware corporate registration came just before the actual ETF application.  History repeated itself Thursday. Hours after the Delaware filing, a Nasdaq filing confirmed BlackRock's plan for an ether-focused ETF.  Bitcoin hit a fresh 18-month high price, soaring to just shy of $38,000 from around $35,000 in a short squeeze early morning BlackRock ETH news, though, BTC saw a sharp reversal, sinking to around $36,300.  ETH was up 10% over the past 24 hours, while BTC advanced 3% over the past 24 hours.  Read more: Wild Bitcoin, Ether Price Swings Spur $400M of Crypto Liquidations, the Most Since August  Altcoins plunge like XRP, DOGE UNI and XLM  While ETH and BTC showed strength, most alternative cryptocurrencies – altcoins – retreated during the day, paring back their gains from the previous days as capital rotation to smaller tokens seemingly halted.  Ripple's XRP, dogecoin [DOGE], uniswap [UNI] and Stellar's XLM declined 6%-7%, while toncoin [TON] pulled back 10% after its over 20% rally over the past week.  Governance tokens of top ETH liquid staking platforms defied the plunge, with Lido's [LDO] and RocketPool's [RPL] rising 18% and 23%, respectively.  The divergence between the two largest crypto assets and the rest of the market was visible in the performance of the CoinDesk Market Index [CMI] sectors. Only the ETH-heavy Smart Contract Platform sector and BTC-led Currencies sector booked gains during the day as the rest of the crypto sectors plummeted.  The altcoin weakness was perhaps buoyed by a generally risk-off day on traditional markets after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank won't hesitate to hike interest rates if necessary, pouring cold water on expectations of a more dovish monetary policy.  U.S. equities tumbled, ending their winning streak with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes down almost 1%.  Why BlackRock's ETH ETF application is important  Market observers opined that a spot BTC ETF, if approved, could attract sophisticated investors who previously couldn't or didn't feel comfortable to buy crypto. While there are several futures-based bitcoin and ether ETFs on the market, they are deemed inferior products due to rollover costs.  ""If act one is a spot bitcoin ETF, then act two is a spot ether ETF,"" said Diogo Monica, president of federally chartered digital asset bank Anchorage Digital.  ""A spot ETH ETF would have a similar impact as a BTC counterpart, providing a regulated and accessible wrapper for institutions and consumers to participate in the ETH ecosystem,"" he explained in an emailed note.  ""But Ethereum adds an extra layer of intrigue as a proof-of-stake asset, which means underlying ETH could also be staked for additional rewards,"" he added.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | ETH | MARKET,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/09/ether-surges-to-7-month-high-outshines-bitcoin-on-blackrock-etf-plans-altcoins-plunge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb9e13b3e6a86c61364d023c80220ed653a172f8-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As a result, the crypto community is keeping a close watch and Neyaroff has promised to reveal proof of his accusations in the coming weeks. Unmasking The “Truth” Former Ethereum Advisor, Steven Nerayoff has announced his intentions to unveil evidence regarding the recent allegations he made against Ethereum Founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin in a few weeks. Nerayoff stated that his legal team is working towards ensuring all information regarding the fraud claims is published properly. He said that he had developed a platform that would allow him to release all evidence without being censored. Related Reading: Prepare For Take-Off: Dogecoin Whales Have Injected $2 Billion Into DOGE “We are making a lot of progress. Information should start flowing within weeks not months. My intent is to make everything I can public. Each can decide for themself. I created another platform that can’t be censored so I’ll publish here and there,” Nerayoff stated. Nerayoff first hinted at possible fraudulent activities at Ethereum in an X (formerly Twitter) post following news of FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried being convicted of fraud and conspiracy. He alleged that the founders of the blockchain network have been directly involved with corrupt United States government officials and has vowed to expose the individuals involved, providing proof of his accusations to the public through legal and social channels. “I believe these corrupt government officials will be unmasked and what we all know the public will learn,” Nerayoff stated. While many individuals in the crypto community are looking forward to the evidence Nerayoff has announced will be disclosed in a few weeks, many community members remain skeptical, wondering if the former Ethereum Advisor has been acting out of spite or looking to gain online popularity through his claims. One crypto user had asked if Nerayoff’s case existed and why he had not filed it yet. Nerayoff’s Attorney, Michael Scotto responded “Yes, Steven Nerayoff has a case. IT EXISTS. We will be releasing all his filings in the near future. Although I won’t go into details I will say everything he has said is true and he has the receipts to prove it.” Nerayoff has also called out people who have relayed their doubts about his claims, stating that his court filings are under the control of his legal team and would not be published on X for legal reasons. “For those saying you haven’t seen anything from me yet you’re either trolling or blind. Plus you didn’t read my court filings. Next court filings are in the hands of my legal team, not X,” Nerayoff stated. Ethereum Insider Fearless Stand In a rather lengthy X post, Nerayoff outlined all his reasons for stating his fraud accusations against Ethereum Founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. The former Ethereum Advisor stated that he was not making the fraud claims for his own benefit, rather his speaking out had a counterproductive result by making him a target and potentially endangering him.

Nerayoff has disclosed that he would continue his pursuit to expose Ethereum and its founders, and he would not be deterred until he accomplishes his goal and justice is achieved.

This increase is attributed to the growing number of miners like Bit Digital and the use of more advanced mining equipment. This makes it imperative for the miner to adjust its operating model while taking into consideration its scale of operations and the quantity of Bitcoins in the treasury. A comparison with gold extraction helps especially for those who find Bitcoin mining to be too complex a topic. First, when you think of mining, images of miners using sieves along riverbanks to retrieve precious metals during the 1848 gold rush may come to mind. As this thesis will show, there are some similarities with Bitcoin mining. As for Bit Digital (BTBT), the miner's shares are at the $2.15 level, or well below its July high of $4.59 as shown in the blue chart below. Tellingly, the price action also indicates that as of August, the stock is no longer moving in tandem with Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) orange chart. Data by YCharts This is mostly because of reduced crypto output due to mining difficulty and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April 2024 which will significantly reduce the rewards obtained when contributing a block to the blockchain network. Thus, the objective of this thesis is to assess how BTBT is adapting its operating model accordingly and whether it is a buy. The company's third quarter 2023 financial results are expected to be announced around November 15 and I start by elaborating on the mining difficulty using the gold analogy. Network or Mining Difficulty First mining cryptocurrency consists of systematically verifying transactions on the blockchain and creating new coins through dedicated hardware and blockchain software. Just like gold diggers in the last century rushing to look for deposits along river banks before others got to the spot, creating Bitcoins is highly competitive as it also involves a multitude of miners, but this time racing to solve complex mathematical puzzles requiring considerable computing power. Now, the larger the concentration of miners at a location competing for scarce resources, the greater the difficulty in mining. This is the same with Bitcoin as new capacity or computing power measured in exahash per second (EH/s) is constantly added to the blockchain network. As for BTBT, its active hash rate was about 2.0 EH/s as of October 31. Moreover, mining difficulty is increasing and reached a new high of 62.46T (or trillion units) on October 30. To obtain an idea of how fast this is increasing, this figure was only around 20T at the end of 2021, meaning that difficulty has increased by more than 200% within two years. This results in a fall in production, unless additional capacity is added rapidly. Thus, BTBT produced 111.6 BTC in October, or a 7% month-over-month decline from the 130.2 BTC produced in September mostly due to network difficulty. Now, looking at the total number of BTC held, this was 1,394.4 at the end of October as summarized below. For this matter, BTBT produces both Bitcoins and Ethereum and the figure of 1,394.4 is the Bitcoin equivalent of its digital asset holdings. Interestingly, this is less than the 1,881.6 BTC it held in its treasury at the end of September signifying that it has been selling some or 487.2 (1,881.6 - 1,394.4) of its produce on the open market to take advantage of the appreciation in Bitcoin prices since the beginning of this year. The rest of the Bitcoins (which are not sold) are kept in the miner's treasury as part of a strategy called HODLing, or holding on to most of their produce. The Halving Event and Bitcoin's Volatility Now , keeping Bitcoin as opposed to selling it on the open market makes sense because of the impending halving event. This will de facto reduce block rewards or miners' main income sources. Tellingly, after April 2024 they will obtain only 3.125 BTC for each block added to the blockchain compared to 6.25 BTC currently. An analogy with gold mining is a scarcity of gold fields resulting in two miners having to work together on the same concession (portion of allocated land) and dividing any quantity of gold extracted into half. With rewards dropping by 50% because of halving, miners must adapt their strategies, and, one solution is to accumulate the excess BTC mined during favorable times. This reserve can serve as a buffer against the impact of reducing block rewards after April next year. The reason is that halving also aims to reduce the pace of Bitcoin creation thereby indirectly cutting its supply. However, there is another key factor at play here, or demand which may not necessarily follow since this is an industry where there is a lot of volatility and where simple demand-supply economics may not apply. One example is investors dumping the cryptocurrency in the aftermath of the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange led by Sam Bankman-Fried back in November last year. At that time, BTC fell beyond the $20K level as charted below. Data by YCharts Currently, a lot of the enthusiasm that is propping up the crypto market is the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the Security and Exchange Commission. In these circumstances, instead of only focusing on the quantity of Bitcoin held by miners, it makes more sense to look at efficiency. This is about making use of power-efficient equipment, tapping into lower-cost electricity like renewables, as well as improving labor productivity. For this purpose, while some miners will upgrade to the latest and highest-efficiency mining equipment, others look for the lowest energy costs. Now, one financial metric that can provide an idea of efficiency is the gross margins, which is 31.74%. However, looking deeper into the income statement, there are also Depreciation and Amortization expenses of $3,725,152.00 for the second quarter of 2023 ending in June 2023. This amounts to 41% of the revenues of $9,037,602.00 obtained for the same period. This is significant and is caused mainly by older-generation mining equipment getting depreciated as suppliers like Bitmain continually release newer and more power-efficient versions of its Antminers. The Diversification Strategy Implies Considerable Changes Furthermore, given the pace at which new releases are affected, mining equipment depreciates rapidly, signifying that it is unproductive to spend capital on these, especially amid rising mining difficulty and with the halving event looming. In this respect, as seen with its hosting agreement with Soluna Computing involving the redeployment of existing equipment from its fleet, BTBT is not spending money to boost production capacity at the expense of seeing the underlying equipment depreciating rapidly. Instead, it is spending Capex on acquiring 132 FusionOne HPC (High-Performance Computing) servers for approximately $35 million. This is within its current spending capacity given that it had cash of $24.4 million on its balance sheet as of October 31 plus digital asset holdings amounting to approximately $48.3 million . These servers will contain 1,056 H100 GPUs supplied by Nvidia ( NVDA ) and be used to support the AI applications (or GPU-accelerated workloads) of a customer with whom BTBT has signed an agreement to supply rental-based hosting services. Noteworthily, the contract is for a three-year term that should exceed $250 million worth of revenue with the equipment to be housed at a third-party data center by the end of this year. bit-digital.com The related income is expected as of January 2024, but, since this is just the initial stage, BTBT will still need additional financing to set up the whole AI infrastructure. It plans to use a mix of cash, selling digital assets, new equity issuance, and equipment-linked debt. For this matter, Nvidia's H100 comes with a hefty price tag of above $40K each, and data centers are now charging more for hosting amid higher demand by hyperscalers like Microsoft ( MSFT ) and other enterprises setting up AI-specific infrastructures. Therefore, it is important to consider factors like profitability and the amount to be raised through equity funding and debt. Now, the company had zero debt on its balance sheet at the end of June. Moreover, as I elaborated in a previous article , the data center environment hosting AI servers differs considerably from that required by Antminers mining digital coins. This means that this timely diversification away from Bitcoin mining into AI-specific infrastructure makes sense, but it means that the company is entering a new business line, implying changes at the operational level. Therefore, it is important to look for more details when the financial results for the third quarter of 2023 (ending in September) are released around November 15 . More of A Hold In the meanwhile, with a valuation grade of D+ , BTBT still remains a richly valued stock despite the downside. In this respect, the Price-to-sales multiples remain higher than the median for the IT sector by over 90% as illustrated below. Valuation Metrics (seekingalpha.com) In conclusion, and again performing a comparison with gold extraction, Bitcoin mining is more energy-intensive, and, given the two pain points facing miners, namely network difficulty and halving, it is imperative that they rapidly adapt. In this case, BTBT's strategy emphasizes diversification instead of accumulating coins which is justified firstly, given the volatility inherent in the crypto asset class may simply sap demand after April 2024, thereby devaluing the Bitcoin reserves being held. Finally, given that the company is venturing into a new business, investors may prefer to wait for concrete profitability metrics like expected margins to be obtained by hosting AI-specific infrastructure in the next week's financial results before investing. Also, it would be useful to obtain an update as to whether the company is recruiting someone experienced in colocation hosting in Tier 3 data centers.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4650005-bit-digital-adapting-to-new-realities-but-important-to-obtain-management-update?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19989816.jpeg

Following the news, ETH's price surged to its highest level of the day near $2,100, up about 3% versus just before the filing came out. It later gave back about half that gain, though it remains up about 9% versus 24 hours earlier.  The company's plan was revealed in a filing by Nasdaq, the U.S. exchange where BlackRock will seek to list the product – which will need regulatory approval. Earlier Thursday, it emerged that the corporate entity ""iShares Ethereum Trust"" had been registered in the state of Delaware; iShares is the name of BlackRock's ETF division.  BlackRock has already made waves in crypto by seeking to list a bitcoin ETF, the sort of easy-to-trade product that could dramatically broaden access to crypto to average investors. CEO Larry Fink has become a vocal supporter of crypto, reversing his previous skepticism.

42392090,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0PTB,1699565081,The Trading Tools Institutions Need to Enter DeFi,"This post is part of Consensus Magazine’s Trading Week, sponsored by CME. Antoni Zolciak is the co-founder of Aleph Zero.  There's good reason for institutions to shy away from DeFi — regulatory uncertainty.  While ultimately desirable, many features native to decentralized finance (DeFi) — permissionless markets, pseudonymity, censorship-resistance — can also be considered gray areas for institutions who want to stay on the right side of the law (or preemptively clear future regulations).  For DeFi to thrive and attract a wider pool of capital it needs to strike the right balance between privacy and transparency through a proactive approach to compliance.  Transparency and compliance  Certain crypto verticals downplay or disregard the importance of regulatory compliance, including standard regulatory disclosures meant to increase transparency. This view is rooted in the industry’s philosophical origins (including a commitment to privacy) and technical foundations (blockchains are transparent by default). For the most part, DeFi has leaned towards this viewpoint.  However, crypto and privacy are not synonymous. They never have been. But privacy and transparency are also not mutually exclusive — a mistaken view that comes from a binary understanding of what privacy is. Instead, privacy has always existed on a spectrum.  DeFi and Web3 create new ways to navigate this spectrum. This has big implications for individual traders and entire industries, can help return privacy to its rightful place as an actual business prerogative, and ultimately something to be negotiated under flexible terms.  A lot of the research that is happening in zero knowledge technology, secure multi-party computation and other areas in advanced cryptography are creating a world where traders can maintain their privacy and businesses (or protocols) can deploy compliant fraud-prevention mechanisms.  Many of the solutions that would soothe the valid institutional and regulatory concerns with crypto are demanding. On-chain intellectual property protection and anti-money laundering (AML) analytics are not simple implementations, but require tools that work in real-time.  Protections for proprietary trading  DeFi needs to be more usable than simple swaps. Let’s introduce blazing-fast order book exchanges that remain decentralized but also protect the strategies of large players and ensure that no bad actors get involved with the ecosystem.  No institutional investor will ever get meaningfully involved in DeFi if all their intellectual property is plain to see for competitors on any block explorer, or even in the exchange itself  DeFi protocols can have all the benefits of having programmable money, permissionless markets and certain degrees of transparency while offering protections for intellectual property that are similar to what exist in traditional finance settings.  Streamlined identity verification  Another problem to solve is the incompatibility that exists between DeFi infrastructure and compliant infrastructure. Regulations are inevitably coming for crypto and Web3 as a whole and an end-to-end compliant approach should be available to users and institutions alike.  If we’re introducing know-your-customer (KYC) and know-your-business (KYB) tools to DeFi, let’s make it as user-friendly as possible. Ideally, these implementations would be interoperable within an entire blookchain ecosystem like Ethereum, including all of its layer 2s.  We need good identity infrastructure that makes things easier for users and developers alike by being compliant from the ground up. DeFi would benefit from having a cross-chain decentralized identity layer that manages user data and privacy but makes the necessary concessions for law enforcement when necessary.  AML analytics  Identity verification goes hand in hand with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations as well. On-chain AML analytics are certainly possible, and maybe even preferable to existing traditional AML analytics software. Analytics need reliable data sources and on-chain tools ensure that’s the case in ways that traditional software would not be able to.  See also: The Perverse Impacts of the Anti-Money-Laundering System | Opinion  The advantages of these analytics solutions go even further than compliance. Institutional players would also benefit from having on-chain risk management solutions as well as help with their due diligence processes.  Is DeFi ready?  Exchange-traded funds (ETF) conversations, the newfound focus on the tokenization of real-world assets and even recent Web3 product launches by major fintech brands (looking at you PayPal and VISA) are signaling an inflow of new institutional capital into crypto markets. Will DeFi also benefit?  The necessary technology is falling into place, and the industry has the right intentions — and so, hopeful, an influx of capital will soon follow. However, this time we must ensure is that DeFi's growth remains sustainable, and this can only happen if it stays on the right side of the law and if institutions meet the obligations of their stakeholders.  Striking the right balance between privacy and transparency — where traders and institutions benefit alike — is what will help soothe institutions’ valid concerns over participating in DeFi markets.

The token’s recent listing on Coinone, one of South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has significantly propelled Kaspa into the top 33 cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization. Since its listing on October 25 in the Korean market, Kaspa has outperformed well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) and popular meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepecoin (PEPE) during market breakouts. KAS Token Skyrockets Reaching New All-Time High Over the past 24 hours, the price of KAS has increased by a remarkable 28.78%, reaching a high of $0.092917. Despite a slight dip in the current price, 0.72% below the all-time high, the token continues to exhibit strong upward momentum. The recent surge in trading volume for Kaspa, amounting to $114,934,098.78 within the last 24 hours, represents a substantial increase of 121.50% compared to the previous day. This surge signifies heightened market activity, indicating growing confidence and interest in the project. Related Reading: Prepare For Take-Off: Dogecoin Whales Have Injected $2 Billion Into DOGE Notably, Kaspa’s consensus mechanism, implemented through the GHOSTDAG protocol, sets it apart from conventional blockchains. Using parallel blocks that can coexist and be ordered through consensus eliminates block orphans, providing enhanced security and scalability. The blockDAG structure enables a high block rate of one block per second, with aspirations to reach even higher rates of 10 blocks per second and eventually 100 blocks per second. The Kaspa implementation encompasses several notable features and subprotocols, including Reachability for querying the DAG’s topology, block data pruning, SPV proofs, and upcoming subnetwork support that will facilitate the implementation of layer 2 solutions. Kaspa Coinone Listing Sparks Price Surge The listing of Kaspa on Coinone has been a significant catalyst for its recent price surge. Coinone has a substantial user base and provides a platform for investors to trade Kaspa against the Korean won (KRW). This listing has opened up fresh avenues for Korean investors to participate in the Kaspa ecosystem, bolstering its market presence and contributing to its rapid ascent in the market rankings. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Jumps Another 6% As Whales Show High Activity Kaspa’s entry into this market has increased visibility and exposure to a wide range of traders and potential investors. The positive response to its listing on Coinone reflects the growing demand for Kaspa in the Korean crypto community.

The project’s consensus mechanism, coupled with its development of features like subnetwork support and layer 2 solutions, positions it as a blockchain solution with growth potential.

Historical evidence from the gold market suggests that lower supply can correlate with higher prices, supporting the idea of a potential price increase for Bitcoin in 2024. Grayscale Investments' Bitcoin Trust currently trades at a 13% discount to its net asset value, providing an arbitrage opportunity for traders. The upcoming conversion of GBTC to an ETF is likely to eliminate this discount. After a monster run over the past month, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has quietly become one of the year's top-performing assets. Key drivers for the crypto rally include continued uncertainty around global inflation, Bitcoin's 2024 halving, and Grayscale Investments' victory in appellate court over the SEC's denial of a spot Bitcoin ETF. After tumbling in 2022, the buzz around Bitcoin is back. After 2024's Bitcoin halving, annual inflation in BTC will drop from roughly 1.8% annually to under 0.9%, a mere fraction of the inflation currently being experienced in major fiat currencies. Additionally, traders looking to join Bitcoin's run still have an interesting arbitrage opportunity in Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ). GBTC currently trades for a roughly 13% discount to Bitcoin. This discount is likely to be erased in the coming weeks or months when GBTC converts to an ETF–the SEC has indicated that they won't try to appeal to overturn Grayscale's legal victory, and the two entities are reportedly now working together on details to finish the ETF conversion. Data by YCharts What Will The 2024 Bitcoin Halving Mean For BTC? Bitcoin is expected to undergo its long-awaiting ""halving"" in 2024. Halving is to Bitcoin what central bank monetary policy is to the dollar, except it's pre-programmed. Sometime in 2024, the supply of new Bitcoin being added to the market will be cut in half. Past halving events have correlated with massive bull runs in BTC, as this piece by Morgan Stanley analysts notes. Below you can see how past halvings have taken effect and their impact on the supply of BTC. You should be able to spot the past halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020. You can also see the decline in BTC's inflation from 10% annually in early 2016 to its current rate of about 1.8%. In 2024, this will get cut in half again. Bitcoin Halvings And Inflation (Finbold) We know that there's a correlation between big bull runs in BTC, but is it reasonable to expect 2024 to play out similarly? Historical evidence from the gold market says that this is a reasonable assumption. For thousands of years before paper currencies, gold was the world's main store of value. But like paper money (and BTC), the supply of gold is not fixed. In fact, the supply of gold historically increases by around 1.5% to 2% annually due to mining. Because mining is difficult, this allowed a higher level of trust in the value of gold than would otherwise be possible. To this point, lower levels of gold production are correlated with higher prices for gold. Gold Supply vs. Price (CME) I'm fascinated by this graph. It shows a clear correlation between rises in the price of gold and lower mining, and vice versa. We see the same thing in BTC. In both markets, there is secondary supply, i.e. people can sell or recycle their gold or trade their BTC for dollars. However, the primary supply tends to have an outsized impact on the price. Does this mean BTC will explode higher in 2024? No one knows for sure what the price of Bitcoin will do going forward. But if Bitcoin does push back towards $100,000, the halving will certainly be among the prime reasons cited as to why the move happened. And importantly, gold's history during the 1970s shows that moves like these are not necessarily predicated on the economy or overall stock market performing well. Arbitrage In BTC: GBTC Still Trades For A ~13% Discount to NAV Bitcoin halving is likely to be the main event for cryptocurrency next year, but this year's story is largely about the push for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. Grayscale Investments has the world's oldest and largest Bitcoin fund, but it's a closed-end fund, meaning new shares can't be created and redeemed to force the value to correspond to the net asset value. This creation/redemption mechanism is very technical, but it's the reason that ETFs trade very close to the value of their assets, while closed-end funds often do not. Initially, GBTC traded at a large premium, but over time, this structure caused Grayscale to trade for a discount to its net asset value. Data by YCharts I've been in this trade for a while, and it's been an odyssey. The discount reached insane levels early this year as arbitrageurs panicked and dumped their positions. Grayscale's first conversion attempts were denied by the SEC, leaving billions of dollars in crypto locked away in the ice. Grayscale appealed the decision and in August of this year, investors finally got the good news they've been waiting for. The conversion is still yet to happen which is why the discount still exists, but I believe it is now very, very likely to happen, for the following reasons. The SEC didn't appeal. The two entities are now working together on the technical details of a spot ETF. Other big firms like BlackRock ( BLK ) and Fidelity have filed applications for Bitcoin ETFs as well. These firms aren't doing this on a whim–they're doing it to be the first ones in line for the Bitcoin ETF market. 13% is a pretty big discount for a conversion deal that looks like a formality at this point. In the end, it's for the best, as spot ETFs will give ordinary investors an easy way to buy and sell crypto without having to worry about storage, security, fraud, or high fees. I thankfully avoided getting caught up in the BlockFi collapse by withdrawing my money before things got dicey, but friends of mine have lost tens of thousands of dollars in various crypto heists and scams. Would much of this have happened if people could have bought a BlackRock or Fidelity Bitcoin ETF? Probably not, and that's likely a big part of the reason why the court felt that having a spot Bitcoin ETF would be a net positive for society. In other news, remember the famous story of the guy who lost his password to hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin? Some clever hackers in Seattle developed a way to crack the code . Apparently, he won't let them recover his Bitcoin. Is this a case of existential angst, a contract dispute, or was he making it up all along ? We may also find out about this one in the coming weeks. Bottom Line The crypto trade here is simple– you can buy GBTC for about 87 cents on the dollar and sell it for 100 when the conversion goes through. All signs are now saying that it will. Then, if another ETF comes along that has a cheaper annual fee, you can swap it out for that one. 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for Bitcoin with halving happening at some point in the year, so getting BTC now at a 13% discount looks appealing.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4649990-bitcoin-booming-again-last-chance-snag-gbtc-13-percent-discount-2024-halving?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19988333.jpeg

19987000,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559967,1699560007,Crypto’s Current Climb: JPMorgan Suggests Rally May Be Reaching Its Peak,"JPMorgan analysts have cast a skeptical eye over the recent crypto rally, indicating it may be built on sand rather than solid ground. Their latest report conveys a guarded stance, suggesting that the market’s exuberance may be outpacing the underlying fundamentals. As the market’s enthusiasm swells, fueled by pivotal developments such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) potential green light of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), these financial experts are urging caution, advocating a closer examination of the elements at play. Related Reading: Bitcoin On The Brink? Analyst Predicts Soaring Open Interest May Signal 20% Price Correction A Closer Look At ETF Approval And Regulatory Battles Within the crypto sphere, JPMorgan analysts disclosed that two significant events have captured investor interest and driven prices upward. These events include anticipating a US-approved spot Bitcoin ETF, which has ignited hopes of new capital inflows. At the same time, recent legal tussles involving the SEC have raised expectations for a more permissive regulatory environment. However, the JPMorgan team, led by analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, presents a contrarian view, deconstructing these drivers and their probable impact on the market. They argue that an ETF approval would usher in fresh capital, which might be misleading. The analysts propose that rather than attracting new investment; the approval could redirect existing funds from current Bitcoin investment products into the new ETFs. The JPMorgan team noted: First, instead of fresh capital entering the crypto industry to be invested in the newly-approved ETFs, we see as a more likely scenario existing capital shifting from existing bitcoin products such as the Grayscale bitcoin trust, bitcoin futures ETFs and publicly listed bitcoin mining companies, into the newly-approved spot bitcoin ETFs. This shift, they assert, would not necessarily expand the market’s capital base. JPMorgan’s team points to the tepid response to similar products in Canada and Europe as evidence, suggesting that a US spot Bitcoin ETF might encounter the same lukewarm reception. Legal victories against the SEC in high-profile cases like Ripple and Grayscale are also interpreted as potential precursors to a regulatory softening. Yet, the analysts remain unconvinced, citing the lingering aftereffects of the FTX scandal and the inherent risks of an under-regulated market. They further disclosed that these factors will likely keep the regulatory tightening trend intact, with little room for significant easing. Bitcoin Halving: A Pre-Priced Crypto Event? The report delves into the much-discussed Bitcoin halving, which traditionally stokes bullish forecasts. However, JPMorgan’s analysts believe the market has already factored in the halving’s supply-squeeze implications. They noted: This argument seems unconvincing as the Bitcoin halving event and its effect are predictable and in our opinion are well factored into Bitcoin price. They calculate that based on current data, the production cost of Bitcoin post-halving should double, particularly from the current $ $21,000 to $43,000. Their analysis concludes with a sobering outlook, anticipating a potential “buy the rumor, sell the fact” scenario post-ETF approval. Such a dynamic could see prices climb on anticipation and plummet once the event materializes, a pattern familiar to seasoned market observers. Echoing similar sentiments, financial commentator Peter Schiff has cast doubt on the longevity of Bitcoin’s price surges driven by ETF speculations. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Strengthens: Record High In Long-Term Holdings Signals Bullish Horizon Schiff warns that post-approval, Bitcoin might face a shortage of positive triggers, potentially culminating in a market sell-off as the ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ phenomenon unfolds. How many times can #Bitcoin rally on the same ETF rumor? Once a U.S. Bitcoin EFT is approved, or $GBTC is able to convert into an ETF, there will be no more “good” news for Bitcoin to rally on. After years of buying the rumor, everyone will finally be able to sell the news. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 16, 2023 Meanwhile, Bitcoin has seen quite a significant move in the past few hours. The asset has now marked a new high for 2023, surging above $37,000, up by nearly 10% in the past day.

However, not everyone expects this uptrend to continue. One crypto analyst has made a case for why Bitcoin and the crypto market at large could be headed for an epic crash. Why Bitcoin And Crypto Will Crash A crypto analyst who goes by Shelby on the TradingView platform has put forward an analysis of why the price rally will end in a massive crash. The analysis which began on October 24, 2023, starts out with expectations of a price rally for Ethereum to the $3,200 level before a breakdown to $200-$600. A follow-up comment shows the expectation for ETH to actually reach $2,100. Or in special circumstances, reach $3,200 while Bitcoin runs up to $36,000 if the ETHBTC pair reaches 0.088 BTC. The second part of this has since played out in that the Bitcoin price has now crossed $36,000 but Ethereum continues to lag behind below $2,000. This bullishness ends in 2023, however, as the analyst expects a crash to happen sometime between Q1 and Q2 2024. They liken this crash to the early 2020 crash that sent crypto rallies spiraling to new lows before the bull market began. The price targets for this predicted crash would see the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum fall more than 50% from their current levels. For Bitcoin, the analyst puts it at sub-$15,000 for the first half of 2024 and Ethereum at sub-$500. However, it is not all gloom as the crypto analyst expects both assets to rally quite well leading up to 2025. “Given my expectation is BTC will top ~70k in 2025, ETH perhaps will top $ 5 – 10k. So buying altcoins in the looming crash will end up very lucrative.” BTC rejected at $37,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com What Happened In 2020? The trend pattern for Bitcoin in 2019 is eerily similar to that of 2023 so far. Just like November 2023, the Bitcoin price had recovered in November 2019, taking the rest of the crypto market with it as well. This rise in price would continue on into the early parts of 2020, but that run would be cut short not long after. Historical data shows that BTC’s price peaked just above $10,000 in February 2020, before the crash began. By March, the price of the asset had fallen almost 50% to $5,400 before the halving took place. This kind of crash is what the analyst is pointing to. If there is a repeat of this, then the current Bitcoin rally could continue on to early 2024, likely reaching a peak of $40,000. But the market bottom might already be marked in November 2022, as a 50% fall would not bring the BTC price below $15,000.

42392079,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0Oj1,1699555745,"2 Years Ago, Bitcoin Hit an All-Time High. Is Another Rally on the Way?","Let me take you back to a simpler time. On this day two years ago, Nov. 9, 2021, bitcoin maxis were sporting red laser eyes, FTX had just closed a $420 million funding round and rumor had it that dogecoin’s (DOGE) biggest fan, Elon Musk, may host an upcoming episode of “S and L.” On this day, just two short years ago, bitcoin [BTC] set its highest price ever.  This post is part of Consensus Magazine’s Trading Week, sponsored by CME. This is column first published in The Node newsletter.  Bitcoin’s “all-time high” is a matter of debate. Depending on where you look, the high water mark will be different. Coinbase calls the top at $68,569 (Nov. 8, 2021 at 7:00 p.m.), CoinMarketCap says it’s $66,953 and your most trusted and trustworthy news and data provider, CoinDesk, notches it a little above $67,000.  I, like many, tend to call the pico top at $69,000 – because it’s okay to round up to the meme number, and because consensus in such a fragmented and illiquid market is really a subjective matter (involving where to draw the line about which exchanges to follow and data sources to watch.)  See also: Bitcoin Tops $37K  The price itself, in retrospect, hardly matters. What was important at the time was that bitcoin was trading up. It was rallying, on an upswing fostered by a collective belief. Many truly thought that bitcoin wouldn’t stop, that $100,000 was soon on the way if we all just believed hard enough. Hence the laser eyes.  It’s now commonly understood that this most historic of rallies was fueled by COVID-era stimulus, boredom and historically low interest rates. That crypto could be impacted by macroeconomic fluctuations was a bitter pill to swallow. Thought to be an inflation hedge, BTC instead traded like many other assets on the far-end of the risk curve.  The months leading up to November 2021’s ATH were a period of “irrational exuberance,” to steal a phrase from Nobel laureate Robert Shiller. Heads of state at the time were seriously concerned about the risks crypto posed to the wider financial system. Jon Cunliffe, then (like now) Bank of England’s deputy governor, likened the multi-trillion dollar crypto market to the subprime mortgage industry in 2008.  There were few actual use cases for crypto, yet a ton of leverage in the system. Crypto, for better or worse, is primarily a market built for speculators. The chief innovations that have come from over a decade of technical research, billions in venture financing and tens of thousands of startups have been financial products like “perpetual swaps” and novel indexes (not to discount pioneering ZK tech).  Cunliffe was correctly worried about the credit risks that had built up in crypto. It’s telling that the first wave of bankruptcies after the market crashed were the centralized lending firms like Celsius and BlockFi. And that FTX’s chief undoing was stacking billions in loans on illiquid collateral. But he was wrong about the potential knock on effects of crypto cratering.  Although pension funds, hedge funds and millions of Americans were invested in crypto, the market itself remained insular.  Today, crypto appears to have decoupled somewhat from the wider economy. While bitcoin hit its all-time high during the same period that the benchmark equity index S&P 500 was cresting on a decade-long bull run, it started trading up at a time when some said “Tech was in a Recession.” Bitcoin is up well over 100% year-to-date, and altcoins are rallying right alongside it.  Much of the excitement about bitcoin is being driven by the “narrative” of growing institutional interest. This isn’t entirely a false story: a number of significant Wall St. firms like BlackRock, VanEck and Fidelity are poised to launch crypto-based exchange-traded funds. Banks are building on blockchains, and “tokenization” has become a finance bro buzzword.  Few people are still talking about crypto’s “banking problems,” and the industry successfully collaborated to dispel a dangerous political movement trying to link Hamas funding to crypto. Ask any white-collar commuter in Grand Central what they think about crypto and it’ll likely be “well, it’s not going away.”  See also: How Policy Shaped Crypto's Banking Prospects | Opinion  It likely remains the case that in the long term, crypto prices are still driven by macroeconomic forces. Bitcoin hit a low and traded sideways while Fed Chair Jerome Powell was raising rates, and it’s still an open question how the asset, launched as a reaction the greed and macroeconomic policies that kickstarted Great Financial Crisis, will fare in an official recession, which could come next year.  In other words, despite signs of a thaw, crypto winter may not be over. There’s hope that the months-long deep freeze drove out the riff-raff, while the brightest minds continued to build. And while a “killer app” hasn’t been found, it’s clear enough the industry has a committed user base. But along with the institutional capital, supposedly waiting on the sidelines to be deployed after a BTC ETF goes live, are likely another wave of speculators and scammers.  I don’t know if crypto’s increasing institutionalization will finally prove Cunliffe right about the risks crypto poses to the wider economy. If prices continue to rip without an actual cause, like an actual use case, it can only be explained by speculation — another round of the “greater fool” fearing FOMO.  But I can say if bitcoin hits $100,000 because of an ETF, it might cost its soul.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/09/2-years-ago-bitcoin-hit-an-all-time-high-is-another-rally-on-the-way,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fee6b8825f79b457f3aa48d07d46a952c85e65af-1172x620.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392095,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0PiZ,1699554921,"Wild Bitcoin, Ether Price Swings Spur $400M of Crypto Liquidations, the Most Since August","Thursday's huge price swings in the two largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum's ether [ETH], prompted more than $400 million of open trades to get liquidated, the most since the August crash.  The wild session comes at a time when BTC and ETH prices have been surging amid Wall Street's burgeoning interest in crypto. Both cryptos surpassed round-number milestones they haven't seen recently. BTC topped $36,000 and then $37,000 for the first time since May 2022 – and almost reached $38,000 – before retracing much of the rally. ETH got above $2,000 and hit the highest level since the April Ethereum upgrade known as Shanghai.  Optimism over ETFs and the potential gusher of money they could lure into the industry fueled the move higher. On Wednesday, CoinDesk reported that Grayscale is in talks with two key Securities and Exchange Commission departments about the conversion of its bitcoin trust, known as GBTC, into an ETF.  And then on Thursday, it appeared that BlackRock registered a new corporate entity – called the ""iShares Ethereum Trust"" – in the U.S. state of Delaware, where many corporations set up shop. iShares is the name of BlackRock's ETF division. The filing was done by BlackRock Advisors, a division of the world's largest asset manager. (The company incorporated the iShares Bitcoin Trust in the state a week before it officially filed paperwork for a spot BTC ETF in June.)  BTC had been around $35,200 before the surge, and after the ETH news emerged, it started heading back toward that level, tanking to about $36,400.  The extraordinarily volatile period resulted in a massive leverage wipeout, liquidating $241 million of short positions and roughly $200 million of longs during the day for all crypto assets combined, CoinGlass data shows.  Liquidations mean that the exchange forcefully closes a leveraged trading position due to the partial or total loss of the trader's money down, or doesn't have enough funds to keep the trade open. The dynamic can exacerbate volatility as traders cover their positions and flushes out excessive leverage from the market.  Thursday saw the largest amount of liquidations in a day since Aug. 17, when cryptocurrencies sharply sold off with BTC dropping to as low as $25,000 from around $29,000, with liquidations totaling $1 billion.  Open interest, or OI, the total amount of open options and futures contracts held by market participants, for crypto derivatives plunged below $24 billion from over $26 billion, per Coinalyze data, as traders dismantled or were forced to close their leveraged positions.  ""12% (-$3b) Total OI wipeout in a few mins on the anniversary of the FTX collapse,"" widely followed crypto trader Hsaka posted on X (formerly Twitter).

Related Reading: Paolo Ardoino Talks FTX, Adoption And Self-Custody With NewsBTC Now, we sat down with Ardoino once again to talk about the underlying reasons fueling the current Bitcoin price rally, Bitfinex’s partnership with El Salvador, their ambition for the long term, and his new position as CEO at Tether, the company behind stablecoin USDT. Ardoino draw a parallel between Bitcoin adoption and the legacy financial market, saying that adoption happens “slowly” but much more in the traditional system. In addition, he claims to be unbothered by his new role to focus more on the work. This is what he told us: Q: What does your new position mean for you personally and for Bitfinex as a company? Will there be any changes for the users? Paolo: No changes at all. I mean, I think on the Bitfinex side, again, my role didn’t change, and so things are progressing at the same pace, with the same attention to our user base. Same excitement for Bitcoin adoption and building Bitcoin infrastructure. So, absolutely no changes on the side. And also on the other side, I’ve been involved in strategy decisions for the last few years. I have always been excited to not just do development but also work on the strategy and the business side. So, also no changes there (…) Given the fact that I’ve been, anyway, leading the strategy made sense to just adjust the title on the Tether side as well. For me. I mean, I’m the same guy that keeps working, keeps coding, keeps doing things that he likes all day long (…) So I like to think that for me, nothing changes. I’m not the type of guy that goes around with fanfare for title changes. I just like to work. I like the two companies that I’m working in. My passion is my work; it is my hobby. Q: Having celebrated two years since the Bitcoin Law made BTC legal tender in El Salvador, do you believe it has significantly impacted the population? Are more people using Bitcoin now compared to 2021? Paolo: So that’s a good question. So first of all, I am always carefully explaining that while we all want change, that is fast change can never be fast. People are historically by nature are reluctant to change. So I think it’s important that people keep that in mind because. I lived part of my time in Switzerland and I was talking to a few banks and local administrations in Switzerland and they were confirming that even for the credit cards and debit cards, it took 15 years to be widely used because people the first time they had the debit cards and credit cards in their pockets, and we are talking about Switzerland, that is basically the country of finance and banks, yet the adoption was so low because people didn’t trust that the piece of plastic that they have in their pockets. So with Bitcoin it’s the same, right? So it’s about earning trust over time. I don’t think Bitcoiners need to push Bitcoin down people’s throats. I think Bitcoiners have to be patient, to explain things in a way that is simple to understand. Sometimes we bitcoiners are a bit too hard to comprehend or too hard to follow just because we like to use big words and complex explanations but that is not what we should be doing. We should be crafting education that is good for a kindergarten teacher or a taxi driver, school bus driver who is selling groceries. That is the real adoption takes time to understand, to get this type of feedback and to adapt the educational processes for that. So I’m sure that the Bitcoin adoption will come. There is a lot of new companies that I’m meeting this, that are moving here in El Salvador to help with the process, to provide further infrastructure, to invest themselves in education. So it’s just a process that takes time and sometimes you have mainstream media trying to demonize the work, pace, and speed at which things are moving here. But again, they are always forgetting that in traditional finance things always move even slower than these. So, I would say that Bitcoin adoption in Salvador is a success and will be even more successful in the next years. Q: Could you share details about Bitfinex’s partnership with El Salvador? What initiatives are you currently working on, and what projects do you hope to develop in the coming years? Paolo: We partnered with two educational projects. One is called Torogoz Dev, which focuses on leveraging the expertise of developers here to instruct and teach other developers. And so to create a community of developers that understand really well Bitcoin, the importance of that is that we want El Salvador to be able to grow its internal knowledge and internal infrastructure and software development base. It’s fine to bootstrap it with people coming from that side, but it’s more and more important to have knowledge and a strong base of developers drawing from the inside. And then also Mi Primer Bitcoin is another partnership that we achieved for a location that is more suitable for the broader public. Then we obtained a securities license so that our goal there is to make sure that El Salvador will become the central financial hub for Central and South America. And I think it has all the chances to do that because the local administration, the president, the government are really forward looking. They seem to think things are on the right track to bring companies or have companies that can leverage securities here in El Salvador to raise capital for their companies, for their enterprises. And it’s quite unique because imagine the United States, if you are a small company that has around between $500,000 and $10 million of market cap, it’s almost impossible to get a loan or to raise capital publicly because then you would need to go to a bank. But the banks are extremely expensive and they will take huge fees and it would cost too much in lawyers for you. So people don’t do that, small companies don’t do that, but Bitfinex Securities aims to create a more democratic access for companies that want to raise capital through securities. Q: Turning to Bitcoin’s current market activity, there’s a widespread belief that the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has bolstered the rally. What is your perspective on this? Do you sense a shift in the market dynamics? Paolo: So I think that since 2022 after FTX, Bitcoin has been extremely oversold. So I think that slowly but steadily it has recovered over the last months. We don’t see much Bitcoin (supply) the sell side right now. Institutions are accumulating Bitcoin left and right. So that is also one of the reasons, in my opinion, why the price is going up. And even with the Bitcoin ETF even further, you can argue easily that that will drive Bitcoin adoption. So I think it’s normal to see the price moving also considering the Halving next year. I think people started to realize that there is a big difference between Bitcoin and everything else, every other token. So people are going for something that maybe doesn’t do 100x in a few days as some random tokens, but is a certainty, right? Is something that is stable, has a strong user base, has strong fundamentals, and that cannot be said for all the other tokens. So that’s why we are seeing this growing excitement around Bitcoin.

With this significant momentum shift possibly brewing, the price per ETH could shoot much higher. Related Reading: Ethereum News Catalyst Could Trigger Triangle Breakout To $4,000 Immediately short-term targets of the ascending triangle could see Ether revisiting all-time highs soon enough. However, longer-term targets are closer to $10,000 per coin. While this might have seemed out of reach in the past, the capital inflows a spot ETH ETF could bring into the market would range from billions to potentially trillions over time.

Today, Sam Ewen, Head of CoinDesk Studios & Web3, takes us through the evolution of loyalty programs leveraging blockchain and why that matters. Big brands are building in this space; we will look at some companies adapting new technology to improve systems. These are interesting use cases.  As advisors, how do you look at companies taking advantage of new technologies to improve legacy systems or gain further competitive advantages?  Also, we address some common NFT myths after the main article in the Ask an Expert section.  Happy reading.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Evolving Loyalty  Why are some of the biggest brands and most successful entrepreneurs looking to reimagine loyalty programs utilizing blockchains  While rewards with purchase and other forms of loyalty plans have been around since the 1790s, American Airlines is often credited with jumpstarting the modern loyalty program when it introduced the AAdvantage frequent flier program in 1981. Since then, 80% of Americans are members of at least one membership or loyalty program, and the number for Gen Z is almost as strong with 70% of them participating in these types of programs in a desire to get exclusive rewards and perks. So with a model that seems to have been proven for over 40 years, why are some of the largest brands and most connected builders exploring blockchain solutions to supercharge their loyalty and rewards offering?  In 2023 we have seen consumer backlash as brands try and extract more value from consumers in order to gain access to perks that had seemed standard. Just witness the mea culpa that Delta issued after a fierce response to them raising the minimum spend and number of flights needed to access even their lowest-level flier perks. Which leads us to a simple premise sparked by Salesforce’s Marc Mathieu, to paraphrase: ""Brands should not try and extract the most value from their top customers, but figure out how to reward their best customers and make them feel special."" To take that one step further, what if there were systems in place that rewarded a variety of actions both owned and operated by the brand and those out in the social and experiential world? This is where the blockchain comes in.  One of the best use cases for blockchains is loyalty and rewards, for a few key reasons:  Transparency: All transactions on a blockchain can be transparently viewed by any party with permission, which can increase trust among users.  Security: Blockchain uses cryptographic techniques that ensure that once a transaction has been added to the ledger, it cannot be altered or deleted.  Interoperability: Blockchain can enable different loyalty programs to be interoperable. Customers can potentially transfer and consolidate rewards from different programs, enhancing the user experience.  There are other benefits but features like these start to unlock new consumer opportunities and grow loyalty into a multi-use ecosystem for forward thinking brands.  Let’s touch on a few brands exploring blockchain loyalty:  Lufthansa - Lufthansa, a large European airline, has introduced Uptrip, an application that lets fliers collect NFTs by doing actions like scanning boarding passes, which then can unlock perks such as flight upgrades and airport lounge access. While still in beta, the project already has seen over 20,000 signups.  Nike - Nike has introduced a new digital sneaker collection that grants holders a variety of new perks. The Our Force 1 digital kicks were less than $20 to collect. Holders not only have assets that will be seen on the feet of your favorite video game characters, but holders were able to unlock secret levels in Fortnite, and they have announced an EA Sports collaboration. Additionally, holders were able to purchase a physical shoe only available to them. Almost 100,000 digital shoes were sold upon launch.  Blackbird - Ben Leventhal, the entrepreneur behind Eater and RESY, has a new venture called Blackbird. Blackbird allows restaurants and their customers to build relationships together through a crypto-powered points system called $FLY. Being pilot tested in New York, Leventhal plans to expand and is hyper-focused on restaurants knowing who their best customers are again and being able to share that data with like minded eateries. They just raised $24M for their Series A from investors like American Express and a16z.  In addition to the above, we have seen brands from LVMH to Starbucks exploring how they can use blockchain based toolsets to connect deeper with their customers. We also have an industry evolving to meet the needs of legacy and start-up brands as proven operators and forward thinking entrepreneurs see an opportunity to help traditional business transform onchain. Service providers like Forum3, Co:Create, Mojito and Superlogic among others are creating the SASS layer of on-chain loyalty.  The question will be asked if this new decentralized paradigm is better at loyalty than the centralized databases of Web2, which seem to be showing wear. There are user experience challenges, adoption curves and frankly some larger crypto branding issues that need to be worked out for this new consumer technology to hit critical mass. The promise of better consumer data privacy, shared goals of both brands and consumers and permissionless cross brand collaboration would say there is something big to keep an eye on.  – Sam Ewen, Head of CoinDesk Studios & Web3  Ask an Expert: NFT Myths  Q: “An NFT is just a jpeg, why pay for it when I can just download it?”  An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a tokenized record of ownership that is distinct, indivisible and has its ownership and properties accounted for and verified using a blockchain.  They can be used to represent ownership of any digital or physical asset, intellectual property, or rights. Just like a masterpiece painting, the original work is much more valuable than any subsequent copies or prints. NFTs can ascribe uniqueness to a digital file and denote an “original” work; this originality is what makes many NFTs valuable. Copying a digital file or artwork does not convey ownership rights and in many cases is copyright infringement.  They can be used to represent ownership of any digital or physical asset, intellectual property, or rights and it needs to be considered how they are treated from a tax reporting and inheritance point of view just like the underlying assets they represent.  Q: Are NFTs a passing fad?  Despite market fluctuations and criticisms, NFTs have demonstrated the potential to reshape ownership, provenance, the creator economy and traditional markets. The core concept of owning unique digital assets in a decentralized and verifiable way is powerful.  NFTs will expand ownership rights and transaction capabilities of all new and existing asset classes and markets.  – Layne Nadeau, NVAL   Keep Reading  Michael Saylor from MicroStrategy discusses why current market conditions are favourable for investing in bitcoin.

42392083,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0P3X,1699546019,Can Stablecoins Get Past Their Instability?,"This post is part of Consensus Magazine’s Trading Week, sponsored by CME. Rajeev Bamra is a senior vice president and head of DeFI and digital assets at Moody’s Investors Service.  Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to hold a stable value through a peg to an underlying asset, such as the U.S. dollar, have gained popularity for their potential to provide the flexibility of cryptocurrency without its price volatility. Their design — whether fiat-backed, as most are, or algorithmic (i.e. backed by other assets or cryptocurrencies) — is meant to offer users a refuge from the price gyrations of traditional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH].  One significant advantage of stablecoins is their operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness in cross-border transactions. Stablecoin transactions can take place with far fewer intermediaries than are involved in traditional bank transfers, for example, making them cheaper and faster to use for sending remittances abroad.  However, although such use cases are promising, stablecoins have not always lived up to their promised stability. In recent years there have been several instances of price depegging, when stablecoins fell below the value of their referenced assets.  See also: USDC Stablecoin Depegs From $1; Circle Says Operations Are Normal  These depegging events have been driven by a range of factors, including regulatory actions, security breaches and imbalances in digital asset pools supporting decentralized exchanges. Investors have responded by divesting their holdings, citing a lack of transparency in underlying reserves and the allure of higher yields from traditional assets in a rising interest rate environment.  Below is a closer look at how several events, as well as changing market conditions, have led to flows away from stablecoins:  Terra: risk of unregulated stablecoins. The collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin, UST, on the Terra network in 2022 showcased the risks associated with unregulated stablecoins. The dramatic fall in UST's value had a cascading effect on tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin, causing it to temporarily trade below its $1 peg. UST's reliance on market anticipation and demand for both LUNA and UST left it vulnerable to market fluctuations.  FTX:risks from links to traditional finance. The collapse of FTX, a once high-valued centralized crypto exchange, raised concerns about contagion in the industry and led to a decline in USDT's value on major exchanges. These events underscore the interconnection between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency space.  Curve and Uniswap: liquidity pool imbalances. Another challenge has been liquidity pool imbalances within decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, such as Curve Finance and Uniswap. These imbalances, often driven by arbitrage and market fluctuations, have led to deviations from the intended peg of 1:1 for USDT, eroding trust within the DeFi community.  Competition from high-yielding, low-risk assets. The inverse correlation between U.S. Treasury yields and stablecoin demand has further complicated the landscape. Rising yields have enticed risk-averse investors to move funds into Treasuries, affecting the market share of stablecoins.  In addition to price volatility and competition from higher-yielding, lower-risk assets like U.S. Treasuries, regulatory ambiguity remains a significant hurdle to expansion of stablecoin usage. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks in the U.S. has left investors cautious and prompted withdrawals from DeFi platforms. The potential adoption of a widely used global stablecoin raises concerns about a shift in purchasing power from sovereign money to private payment services.  See also: How Stablecoins Merge Traditional and Decentralized Finance  Despite these obstacles, Moody’s believes that stablecoins are likely to play a notable role in a developing digital economy, because they offer an accessible bridge between traditional finance and DeFi. Indeed, some large financial firms are investing in the future of stablecoins. Recently, PayPal introduced an institutional stablecoin, and Visa has extended support for USDC payments within its own operations.  Stablecoins do face competition from more stable alternatives, such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and tokenized bank deposits. However, the demand for stability and security in digital currencies remains. Until these alternatives become widely available, in Moody’s view stablecoins will likely be a significant force in shaping the future of digital money.

19980181,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559863,1699545648,Prepare For Take-Off: Dogecoin Whales Have Injected $2 Billion Into DOGE,"Dogecoin finally broke over $0.76 in the last 24 hours after a week of range trading and has emerged as a formidable performer in the past month. The crypto has seen gains of 25.9% in a 30-day timeframe, but the rally may be far from over. DOGE whales have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to put the meme coin on the map, increasing their holdings by a substantial amount in the past month. On-chain data has revealed that large DOGE addresses have added more than $2 billion in DOGE in an effort to drive the crypto towards the $0.1 level. Dogecoin Whales Inject $2 Billion Into DOGE In 30 Days Data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock has reiterated the current bullish sentiment among Dogecoin whales. According to its Balance By Holdings metric, the balance of addresses holding between $100,000 to $1 million worth of DOGE has increased by 24.31% in the past 30 days. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Will Take Off In One Week, Here’s The Target Likewise, addresses holding between $1 million to $10 million increased by 27.43%, and addresses holding more than $10 million worth of DOGE increased by 29.28%. A closer look into this metric’s chart shows that the collective holdings of these addresses holding at least $100,000 worth of DOGE increased from $7.37 billion on October 7 to $9.469 billion on November 9. This implies that the crypto’s whales have acquired an additional $2.099 billion in DOGE within the past month. Source: IntoTheBlock For regular investors, this whale activity is a bullish signal for DOGE’s price trajectory, as whale accumulation is still ongoing. IntoTheBlock’s data has also revealed these addresses holding at least $100,000 worth of DOGE have acquired $119 million in DOGE in the past 24 hours alone. IntoTheBlock’s Order Books metrics reveal an interesting imbalance between the supply and demand for DOGE. At the time of writing, buyers have placed buy orders of 902 million DOGE on various crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, sellers have only put up 876 million DOGE for sale. Source: IntoTheBlock Will DOGE Return To $0.1? The current shift towards higher demand and the current accumulation of whales speaks volumes of the current sentiment around Dogecoin and the massive injection of capital into Dogecoin could significantly impact its price. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out on X that DOGE’s crucial support wall at the $0.072 to $0.073 price point outstrips the resistance in strength. According to Martinez, a breakout over $0.76 puts the next significant hurdle at $0.084.

19978501,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559897,1699542024,Polygon (MATIC) Jumps Another 6% As Whales Show High Activity,"Polygon has continued its recent bullish momentum in the past day, jumping a further 6%, as on-chain data shows the whales are highly active currently. Polygon Is Now Up More Than 21% In The Past Week The past month has been a great time for Polygon investors as the cryptocurrency has observed a substantial uplift. Earlier in this period, the growth had been slower, but recently the asset has really stepped up. Here is a chart that shows how MATIC’s rally has looked over the last 30 days: Looks like the value of the asset has seen an explosion during this period | Source: MATICUSD on TradingView With the latest leg in the surge, Polygon has reclaimed the $0.80 level for the first time since July of this year. Earlier in the day, the coin had spiked to as high as $0.84, but since then it has registered a pullback towards the current price levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin In Tight Zone: Why A Rally Will Happen If DOGE Clears $0.076 Nonetheless, even with the retrace, the asset is up a net 6% during the last 24 hours. As it stands, MATIC’s profits of 21% in the past week are among the best in the sector, with only Chainlink (LINK) showing a better performance inside the top 20 assets by market cap. It would appear that the whales may be playing a major role in this latest rally if on-chain data is anything to refer to. Polygon Whale Transaction Count Is At Elevated Levels Currently As pointed out by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, whales have been quite active in the market recently. The relevant indicator here is the “whale transaction count,” which keeps track of the total number of Polygon transactions that are carrying at least $100,000 in value. The below chart shows the trend in this MATIC metric over the past few months: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the Polygon whale transaction count has been at high levels recently. To be more particular, the whales have been making more than 161 transactions per day, which is the highest the metric has been since July. Generally, high activity from the whales can be a predictor of volatility, as a large number of moves of these humongous holders together can have the power to move the market. Naturally, such volatility can take the cryptocurrency in either direction, as the whale transaction count metric merely tells us about the number of transfers that the whales are making, and not whether these are buying or selling transactions. Related Reading: Solana Whale Deposits $11M In SOL To Binance, Bearish Signal? In the chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another metric: the combined supply held by the 100,000 to 10 million MATIC addresses. As is visible in the graph, the sharks and whales have been accumulating since 24th October, suggesting that their buying may have been providing support to the rally. The supply of these key holders may be one to watch for in the coming days, especially given the high transaction activity that the whales in particular are making currently. If the indicator observes a significant drawdown, then it would be a sign that the group has decided to take their profits.

42392078,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0Odt,1699542000,Blockchain Staking Firms Update Best Practices Amid 'Increased Scrutiny',"The Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA), an advocacy group of firms and organizations in the business of staking on blockchains like Ethereum, published an updated list of standards on Thursday that they say will ensure consumer protections and promote responsible innovation.  The new ""staking principles"" have been signed off by 18 industry players, including some well-known entities like Ava Labs, Blockdaemon, Coinbase, Lido, Polychain, Paradigm and Rocketpool.  The list, prepared with the assistance of Paradigm’s Policy Lab, was updated ""in light of the rapid advancements in the staking space and the need for updated best practices,"" according to a press release.  The standards are intended to update an original set of principles released in 2020, according to the press release. They call for clearer communication from service providers, giving users total control over how much of their assets to stake, and the need to precisely describe the responsibilities of service providers.  “Amid rapid technological advancement, self-regulation from leaders of the proof of stake ecosystem is essential,” Evan Weiss, founder of POSA, said in the press release. “The updated POSA principles underscore the ecosystem's commitment to clarity and responsibility, especially in a time of increased scrutiny and misconceptions.

42392093,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0Pxx,1699539429,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Tops $37K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin topped $37,000 in the U.S. morning after it neared that level in Asian trading hours to create a ""short squeeze"" that drove prices higher. Just under $50 million of bitcoin shorts (bets against the price rising) were liquidated in a four-hour period, extending the BTC rally. Short squeezes occur when the price of an asset jumps higher than expected and short sellers are forced to cover their positions, driving the price higher still. Exchanges with a large Asian presence such as BitMEX, OKX and Binance accounted for large chunks of the exited positions. Bitcoin's bullish momentum followed reports late Wednesday that the U.S. SEC is beginning talks with fund manager Grayscale, with whom it has been engaged in a legal fight over the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF.  Shares of U.S. crypto-centric companies ticked upward in pre-market trading, riding the momentum of the latest rally in BTC and reflecting the fresh optimism of a spot bitcoin ETF finally being approved in the U.S. Coinbase was up about 4% as of around 6.00 ET, while MicroStrategy, the software developer that holds over 150,000 BTC on its balance sheet, rose almost 5%. Mining firms Marathon and Riot advanced around 9.8% and 6% respectively. Robinhood showed more restrained gains of 2.5%, having dropped 14% on Wednesday after reporting big drops in its revenue and trading activity.  Standard Chartered's venture arm and SBI Holdings are forming an investment company with $100 million backing to target crypto startups. The company will be established in the UAE and focus on firms in market infrastructure, risk and compliance, DeFi and tokenization. Standard Chartered has pivoted its crypto activities toward the UAE in recent months, choosing Dubai as the jurisdiction in which to start safeguarding digital assets for institutional clients in the first quarter of 2024, citing the region's mature regulatory structure relative to other jurisdictions.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the dollar index's performance since early July. The index gauges the greenback's value against major fiat currencies.  DXY's rally ran out of steam above 107 in early October. Since then, it has pulled back to 105.50 in a positive sign for the crypto market.

19976871,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559916,1699538459,Shibarium Network Lull – How It Affects The Future Of BONE,"Shibarium, the highly anticipated layer-2 solution for the SHIB army, finally became functional on Aug. 28, following a rocky launch plagued by technical issues that drew scorn from the broader cryptocurrency community. The launch promised a new era of efficiency for SHIB holders who had eagerly awaited this solution for over a year. However, recent data paints a troubling picture of Shibarium’s current state, with a steep decline in user engagement and network activity levels reminiscent of its early days of operation. Data from the Shibarium explorer reveals a significant drop in user engagement. On Nov. 6, Shibarium recorded a mere 9,740 transactions, a stark contrast to the network’s peak on Sept. 11, when daily transactions surged to over 202,000. This decline raises concerns about the project’s long-term viability and whether it can deliver on its promises of scalability and efficiency. Source: ShibariumScan Shib Name Service (SNS) Launch The decline in new address counts on the chain appears to be closely tied to the drop in daily transactions. This trend persists despite the introduction of Shiba Inu’s “Shib Name Service” (SNS) on Oct. 30. SNS, a decentralized naming service, allows users to create human-readable addresses for their Shibarium wallets. While the SNS launch aimed to enhance user experience and accessibility, it has not been able to reverse the declining user engagement on the network. BONE market cap currently at $169 million. Chart: TradingView.com Impact On BONE Price Shibarium’s struggles are not limited to user engagement; they are also affecting the price of the native token, BONE. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, the current price of BONE stands at $0.734137, with a 4.0% increase in the last 24 hours and a 2.5% rise over the past week. On the token’s spot market, most participants have been distributing their BONE holdings, which is evident from the momentum indicators on a 24-hour chart. Selling pressure is outweighing accumulation, which is concerning for the token’s future value. BONE 14-day price action. Source: Coingecko Shibarium’s failure post-launch raise several concerns within the cryptocurrency community. The project’s inability to maintain the initial momentum following a challenging launch is a red flag for investors and enthusiasts. The decline in user engagement, even after introducing user-friendly features like SNS, suggests that the core issues surrounding Shibarium’s technical infrastructure need attention. @ShytoshiKusama has been selling stuff to shibarmy and amassing their own wallet. More talk than action, since shib became successful, everything he has done has been a failure (shiboshis, land, Shibarium and sns) Fuk — Mefam (@0xMefam) November 1, 2023 Related Reading: Cardano October Whale Frenzy – What Lies Ahead For November? The dwindling user base has a direct impact on the value of BONE, with selling pressure dominating the market. To regain its footing, Shibarium will need to address the technical issues, improve its user experience, and regain the trust and enthusiasm of its user base. Shibarium, which held significant promise as a layer-2 solution for the SHIB community, is currently facing a critical test of its long-term viability. The decline in user engagement and its effect on BONE’s price indicate that the project has some challenges to overcome. Investors and enthusiasts will be watching closely to see if Shibarium can bounce back and fulfill its potential. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

In response to questioning over whether Tom Farley, former president of the New York Stock Exchange, was looking to buy FTX, Gensler said: ""If Tom or anybody else wanted to be in this field, I would say, 'Do it within the law.'""  ""Build the trust of investors in what you’re doing and ensure that you’re doing the proper disclosures, and also that you’re not commingling all these functions, trading against your customers,"" Gensler continued. ""Or using their crypto assets for your own purposes.""  There are reportedly several groups in the running to take over FTX following last week's trial that saw the company's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, receive a guilty verdict on seven criminal charges.  The speculative rally indicates hope for further upside if FTX 2.0 gets the green light, although there is no certainty that a native token would even be used in a restarted exchange. FTT is currently trading at a seven-month high of $2.30 with trading volume over the past 24 hours exceeding $300 million, according to CoinMarketCap.

Crypto Analyst Reveals The Ideal Price,"As the market continues to rally, many begin to feel that they have missed the chance to get in early on their favorite altcoins, including XRP. However, a prominent crypto analyst has provided hope to those still looking to get in on the token as he talks of the possibility of a correction and the ideal price to accumulate the crypto token. The Right Time To Be A “Buyer” In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, the CEO and founder of MN Trading, Michaël van de Poppe, acknowledged how the price of XRP has been rallying in recent times. He further went on to hint at the fact that XRP has always corrected whenever it experienced such rallies. The one that he pinpointed was when the token corrected from $0.93 to $0.45 before its resurgence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Parabolic Rally Above $600,000: Crypto Analyst Says It’s Closer Than You Think As such, his belief seems to be that the XRP will dip once again. This time, he stated that an ideal time to be a buyer will be if XRP is able to correct to around $0.54. However, many in the XRP community will be hoping that XRP continues to rally from henceforth, especially considering that it just recently hit the $0.7 price mark. The technical and fundamental analysis surrounding the XRP ecosystem seems to be bullish, with many predicting more upward trend from the $0.7 mark. In a recent X post, renowned crypto analyst Egrag, who had predicted that a god candle was coming for XRP, mentioned that that XRP just witnessed an “exciting development.” This is because the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has crossed over the 55 MA. According to him, this “bullish crossover” historically signifies the beginning of “significant price explosions.” Source: X To consolidate this development, he stated how XRP closing above the $51.3 billion Fib 0.702 level was critical as it could be the “watershed moment for our victory.” XRP Fundamentals Are Also Bullish The Ripple Swell Conference 2023 is currently ongoing, and the event has lived up to the hype following Ripple’s latest announcements. Apart from the rebranding of its payment service as Ripple Payments, the crypto company also announced how its partner Onafriq will begin utilizing its payment service. This move would see Ripple open up the cross-border payments structure across three continents: Africa, Europe, and Australia. Related Reading: Dogecoin Climbs Above $0.075 To 3-Month High, But Metrics Show It’s Far From Done The crypto company is also expected to make more announcements before the conference comes to a close on November 9.

19975065,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559889,1699534808,"PEPE’s Price Propels To 3-Month Highs, Here’s Why","Amid the bullish sentiment around the cryptocurrency market, popular meme coin PEPE has recently experienced a significant surge in its price recording over a 15% increase in its price in the past 24 hours. The Price Of PEPE Gains Traction PEPE seems to be gaining traction and heading towards a bullish run indicating potential benefits for investors. The meme coin’s price is currently sitting at $0.0000013, indicating a 15% increase in price in the past 24 hours. The surge in price might be traced back to the Dogecoin (DOGE) millionaire Glauber Contessoto, who picked PEPE to be among his top 10 choice cryptocurrency investments. According to the millionaire, PEPE seems to represent the same irreverent, internet-culture-focused approach that initially drew him to Dogecoin. Related Reading: Could Meme Kombat be the Next Pepe as Presale Hits $1M Milestone PEPE might have experienced a surge in its price, but the meme coin is still over 69% down from its all-time high of $0.000004354 in early May. However, the bullish sentiment circling in the crypto market has propelled the meme coin’s price by 89% over the past 30 days. The token has also experienced a significant increase in whale transactions in the past 24 hours. The number of whale transactions involving at least $100,000 in PEPE increased by 50% over the past 24 hours. According to data from Santiment, show that its deposits to crypto exchanges have since fallen by 33% in just 3 days, the report, despite the increase in whale transactions. This could be because investors are choosing to hold for higher prices rather than sell now. In addition, PEPE’s recent social media dominance seems to have significantly contributed to the increase in price by the token. It was revealed by Santiment that the memecoin experienced an impressive 105% surge in its social media volume in the past 24 hours. Decline In Active Address Doesn’t Hinder Memecoin’s Performance PEPE’s performance this month is nothing compared to that of last month just yet. In October, the price of PEPE grew by 60%, this might be due to the bullish nature of the month of October also known as ‘Uptober’ in the crypto space. PEPE has seen a consistent decline in the number of active addresses. According to IntoTheBlock, it was revealed that the number subsequently fell from a total of 3,700 to 2,020 active addresses. This pattern suggests that, due to memecoin’s failure to live up to investor expectations, they may be selling their PEPE holdings in favor of trending altcoins.

42392084,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0P8f,1699531558,Solana Tokens Sees Risky Bets Increase After End of Sam Bankman-Fried Trial,"Some Solana ecosystem tokens and meme coins are gaining value from SOL’s 110% rally over the past month, a sign of rising bullish expectations for the blockchain among investors.  Bonk (BONK), a Solana token that began life as a meme coin in January, has surged 66% over the past 24 hours to extend a week-long rally to over 170%, data shows. Trading volumes and market capitalization have nearly tripled in a weekly period.  Such a resurgence indicates new money flowing into the Solana blockchain, especially among risk-on traders. Value locked on Solana ecosystem projects has increased to $465 million on Thursday from $300 million at the start of October, suggesting a boost in fund allocations toward decentralized applications built on the network.  At the start of November, developers introduced single-sided staking on bonk liquidity pools – allowing traders to earn yields of over 25% annualized by supplying bonk tokens to the Bonk Inu platform, which may have contributed towards improved sentiment.  Bonk took center stage in the Solana ecosystem in January as sentiment around the blockchain network hit in the aftermath of the Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX exchange debacle.  The tokens ran up as much as 3,200% in just three weeks after issuance, almost single-handedly inciting activity in the Solana ecosystem at the time, as previously reported.  Meanwhile, SOL has emerged as one of the top-performing crypto majors this year in a sign of the market shaking off the network’s purported closeness to crypto exchange FTX’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who has since faced criminal charges and has been pronounced guilty on seven charges of fraud.  Bankman-Fried was one of the top proponents of the Solana ecosystem during his active reign. He invested millions of dollars in Solana’s SOL tokens and across the Solana ecosystem and even launched the decentralized exchange Serum atop the network.  However, Bankman-Fried’s downfall seemed to kickstart a downward spiral in Solana tokens and ecosystem projects as investors considered the one-time crypto titan’s arrest a major headwind for the network.  FTX was an early investor in Solana and regularly received a significant volume of SOL unlocked according to a planned vesting schedule. It held over $1.16 billion worth of the tokens as of September 2023, as per a court filing, fuelling fears of selling pressure as the tokens are made available.  But recent actions by the bankruptcy committee overseeing FTX have seemingly buoyed sentiment. The committee staked over 5.5 million SOL, worth $122 million at the time, on the Solana network in mid-October, temporarily dampening fears of a sell-off.",POSITIVE,SOL | BONK,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | SOL | TRADING | BONK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/09/solana-tokens-sees-risky-bets-increase-after-end-of-sam-bankman-fried-trial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0542ee978f6a45024c13e89e50fdbbf0d7992546-1024x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19973430,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559898,1699531243,Crypto Analyst Predicts 2450% XRP Price Surge Following Bullish Crossover,"In a detailed analysis, crypto analyst Egrag has forecasted a remarkable 2450% rise in the XRP price, citing a bullish crossover in the 2-week XRP market cap chart, where the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has exceeded the 55 Moving Average (MA). This pattern is typically seen as a precursor to substantial price increases. Egrag, through a post via X, emphasized the significance of this development: “XRP CONFIRMED KABOOM: On the 2-Week Time Frame, we’ve witnessed an exciting development as the 21 EMA has crossed over the 55 MA. This bullish crossover historically signifies the onset of significant price explosions.” Bullish Crossover Heralds Massive XRP Price Surge The analysis highlights two previous instances where similar patterns led to significant price movements. The first, referred to as “Kaboom A,” occurred between early 2015 and early 2017. During this phase, XRP’s market capitalization varied between $142.642 million and $349.476 million. Following the bullish crossover of the 21 EMA over the 55 EMA in the 2-week chart, XRP’s market cap experienced a significant rise, breaking through the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level at $2.592 billion and peaking at over $126 billion in January 2018. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Declares Intent To Bring XRP Battle To Supreme Court From December 2020 to April 2021, there was a shorter cycle. Again, a bullish crossover of the 21 EMA above the 55 MA in the 2-week chart was seen initially. As a result, the XRP market capitalization rose from $.7.67 billion to over $88 billion (and with it the price to $1.96) In the current “confirmed KABOOM Cycle”, XRP’s market cap is hovering above the $35.235 billion mark, which again equates to the 0.5 Fibonacci level. At press time, it stood at $37.516 billion. Delving into the current situation, Egrag explained: Notably, in the previous ‘Kaboom A’ phase, the Fib 0.5 level acted as a clear launch pad. In the current ‘Confirmed KABOOM Cycle,’ XRP’s Market Cap is once again rebounding from Fib 0.5, hinting at an imminent ‘Kaboom Cosmic Ignition.’ However, XRP’s market capitalization is currently facing several key levels. Egrag emphasizes the critical nature of the $51.3 billion market cap, which coincides with the 0.702 Fibonacci level. A close above this threshold on the 2-week chart could trigger a significant rally for XRP, or as Egrag puts it: “XRP closing above the $51.3 billion Fib 0.702 level could be the watershed moment for our victory.” Related Reading: Third Ever XRP Bull Signal Is Back: What To Expect Remarkably, Egrag highlights another crucial resistance level in his chart, a descending trend line (dashed red line) that has formed since the peak in January 2018. According to Egrag, a breakout above this level could trigger a rally of more than 2450% (from the current market cap and price). The final target for the XRP market cap could be the 1,618 Fibonacci extension level at $283.489 billion and the 2,618 Fibonacci extension level at $959.663 billion. The latter would translate to an XRP price of $17.94. Questions From The Community In response to questions from the community, Egrag explained the significance of the $51.3 billion level: “This is a macro resistant range, because closing multiple weekly candles above this range means u will never see XRP below this price or in cents, we will see XRP price only in dollars.” When inquired about the likelihood of another price test prior to an increase, Egrag conceded, “Possible but it will be a wicking process while we are sleeping,” suggesting that any pullbacks could be short-lived. At press time, XRP traded at $0.6928.

India introduced a 30% tax on crypto profits and the 1% TDS on all transactions in July, 2022, resulting in traffic taking a nosedive and exchanges going into survival mode.  India's most controversial crypto policy, a 1% transaction tax deducted at source, needs to be lowered to 0.01% to help the government achieve its aims of boosting revenue and improving transparency, a New Delhi-based technology policy think tank said in a new study.  The tax, a form of income tax known as TDS, has prompted as many as 5 million crypto traders to move their transactions offshore, and has cost the government a potential $420 million in revenue since it was introduced in July, 2022, according to the study by the Esya Centre.  The findings in the ""Impact Assessment of Tax Deducted at Source on the Indian Virtual Digital Asset Market"" go one step further than the group's previous report, which revealed Indians moved more than $3.8 billion in trading volume from local to international crypto exchanges after the controversial crypto rules were announced. They show that, at least in part, the tax failed to achieve one of its stated aims: taxing people who are earning profits.  ""While the VDA market in India is burgeoning, the benefits of the same are being reaped by offshore exchanges,"" said Vikash Gautam, the report's author, referring to virtual digital assets. ""Data shows that two likely policy objectives of the tax – to curb speculation and create transparency around transactions – have not been achieved.""  Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government announced a 30% tax on crypto profits and the 1% TDS on all transactions in February, 2022. At the time, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the intention behind the TDS, the more controversial of the levies, was to increase traceability in India’s crypto ecosystem. Domestic and international participants warned it could kill the industry, and Indian crypto traffic nosedived in the months following its implementation, forcing almost all major exchanges into survival mode.  Representatives of the domestic industry have pleaded with the authorities on numerous occasions to lower the taxes. In addition to tracing transactions, the intention behind TDS was to discourage ""speculative activity,"" according to the study, which analyzed transaction volumes from 13,000 peer-to-peer (P2P) traders and surveyed crypto exchange executives.  The Finance Ministry had not responded to a CoinDesk request for comment on the study by publication time.  The study also urged the government to clarify the applicability of TDS to offshore platforms.  ""It just isn't enforceable, as per stakeholders,"" Gautam said in an interview. ""It is possible to be done with international cooperation, but we do understand it is a long process. Some of the other countries have some arrangements with international exchanges to track that.""

BTC climbed above $36,000 for the first time in around 18 months during Asian trading hours on Thursday, and the bullish momentum fed through to U.S. publicly-traded firms with crypto exposure, such as the Coinbase (COIN) exchange, software developer MicroStrategy (MSTR) – which owns a large number of bitcoin, trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) and mining firms Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT).  Most of the companies fell Wednesday, and bitcoin's latest rally appears to be turning their price movement upward. COIN had added about 4% as of 11:03 UTC (6:03 ET). MicroStrategy, which held 158,400 BTC on its balance sheet as of the end of last month, rose almost 5%, while mining firms Marathon and Riot are up 9.8% and 6% respectively.  Robinhood is showing more restrained gains of 2.5%, having closed on Wednesday down over 14% after reporting big drops in its revenue and trading activity earlier this week.  These gains may also reflect fresh optimism of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) finally being approved in the U.S., following reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened talks with Grayscale Investments about converting its bitcoin trust product into an ETF.

42419132,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDva9,1699528069,Exploring The Two 'Overlooked' Bullish Tailwinds for Bitcoin,"The U.S. Treasury recently announced a slower-than-expected pace of 10-year and 30-year bond sales, capping the upside in the 10-year yield, a positive outcome for cryptocurrencies and other assets.  Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal has strengthened amid worsening economic and geopolitical issues.  Unless you have been underwater for the past week, you have probably heard about bitcoin [BTC] rising to 18-month highs above $36,000, mainly on hopes of one or more exchange-traded funds (ETF) getting approved.  The so-called spot ETF narrative is hogging the limelight, perhaps rightfully so, as the eventual launch is expected to bring billions of dollars in investor money into the market.  That said, there are at least two other bullish, underappreciated tailwinds supporting upside in the cryptocurrency. Let’s discuss those in detail.  U.S. Treasury’s refunding strategy  The U.S. Treasury has long been releasing a “quarterly refunding announcement,” publishing its plans for bond issuance/sales over three months. Markets rarely noticed the announcement in recent years.  But the latest Nov. 1 release was closely watched as markets feared the Treasury would step up the issuance of longer-dated bonds to handle the burgeoning debt load.  Such an outcome could have seen the yield on the U.S. 10-year note, the so-called risk-free rate of return, establish a foothold above the much-feared 5% mark, disincentivizing investments in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other assets. All else equal, less bond supply means upward pressure on prices and downward pressure on yields.  However, the Treasury said it plans to borrow less than anticipated in Q4, announcing a slower-than-expected pace of 10-year and 30-year bond sales.  Since then, the yield on the 10-year note has declined from 4.93% to 4.52%. It could drop further in the coming weeks, thanks to Treasury’s slower debt sales and hopes the Fed’s tightening cycle has ended. On Friday, the U.S. nonfarm payrolls data missed estimates, weakening the case for continued rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.  Safe-haven appeal  Bitcoin has more than doubled this year, in line with its record of beginning new bull trends in 12 or more months leading up to the reward halving. The fourth halving is due in March/April 2024. The latest cycle, however, looks different than previous ones, thanks to bitcoin’s strengthening safe-haven appeal, according to Noelle Acheson, author of the widely-followed Crypto is Macro Now newsletter told CoinDesk.  In other words, considering the economic and geopolitical risks, the path of least resistance for BTC is higher. A safe haven asset appreciates or retains its value in terms of economic or geopolitical crisis.  While the U.S. economy still appears resilient, a slowdown is increasingly likely. The International Monetary Fund recently cut its 2024 global growth forecast to 2.9% from its July forecast of 3.0% while expressing concerns over geopolitical tensions, China’s property market issues, and commodity volatility.  The recent conflict in the Middle East suggests the cold war between the U.S., China, and Russia is escalating, according to geopolitical strategist Velina Tchakarova.  That could worsen economic issues, boosting demand for censorship and seizure-resistant assets like bitcoin.  “One of the big differences between this cycle and the previous one is the strength of the “safe haven” narrative. Back in 2021, the tailwinds were mainly liquidity and speculation on the ETF impact - this time, they are ETF speculation and a deepening understanding of the safe haven narrative, at a time one, is regretfully needed,” Acheson told CoinDesk.  “Safe haven has several meanings: for many who need to ensure their assets are seizure-resistant, a digital bearer asset is ‘safer’ than fiat in a bank account or even gold, which is hard to transport. For others, “safe” means a provably hard supply limit at a time when governments are going to have no choice but to dilute [fiat] currencies,” Acheson added.  Central banks worldwide have begun cutting rates, a development that could dilute their respective national fiat currencies and boost demand for alternative assets like BTC.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/09/exploring-the-two-overlooked-bullish-tailwinds-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7082c0bc8a09a5527ac657aa14cf9beac27d71a7-4096x2304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Large holders, defined as addresses holding over 0.1% of a cryptocurrency’s circulating supply, accumulated nearly 1.89 billion ADA coins. But is this development good news or bad news for the Cardano ecosystem? Large Holders Netflow is a metric that measures the number of inflows minus outflows pertaining to addresses held by large ADA investors. This metric provides valuable insights into the behavior of major stakeholders and their impact on the ADA market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Backed By Founders Of Top Crypto Data Analytics Firm Predicts Bullish Trends When large holders accumulate more ADA than they are selling, it suggests a bullish sentiment among the biggest investors. In this case, it indicates that they believe in the long-term potential of Cardano and are willing to hold onto their assets, possibly anticipating future price appreciation. $ADA got a strong vote of confidence last month. Big holders accumulated 1.89 billion ADA last month, translating to over $600 million at current prices. The majority of the accumulation took place between $0.249 and $0.271. 🔗https://t.co/FCp16WINDG pic.twitter.com/cIRpSDC1fR — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) November 7, 2023 Conversely, if large holders were offloading their ADA holdings in large quantities, it could be perceived as a bearish sign, signaling a lack of confidence in the project or an impending market downturn. However, the data suggests that they are accumulating, which could be seen as a positive indicator. ADA’s Current Price And Recent Performance As of the latest data from CoinGecko, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.369344. Over the past 24 hours, the ADA price has experienced a 3.3% increase, and it has surged by 20.4% in the last seven days. These price movements suggest a growing interest and confidence in ADA among investors. ADA market cap reaches $13 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com In addition to the large holders’ accumulation, Cardano has been making waves in the blockchain development sphere. According to Santiment, a prominent analytics firm, Cardano ranks as the top blockchain in terms of development activity over a 30-day period. The project has recorded an impressive 502.57 GitHub commits during this timeframe. Source: Santiment Related Reading: Exploring The Resurgence Of BNB: Unveiling The Force Behind Renewed Interest Cardano’s Strong Development Activity Santiment has previously emphasized that heavy development activity is a strong positive indicator for a cryptocurrency project. It signifies that developers believe in the protocol’s potential for success and are actively working on improving the technology. Such activity also reduces the likelihood that the project is an “exit scam” or a token without substance. The recent accumulation of ADA by large holders, coupled with its positive price performance, suggests growing confidence in the Cardano ecosystem. Additionally, the blockchain’s active development and commitment to enhancing its technology indicate a bright future for ADA. While the crypto market is known for its volatility, these factors point towards a favorable outlook for Cardano in the eyes of investors and developers alike.

42419124,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDvTx,1699527600,SBF Trial: The Last Day of Summer Camp,"We weren't really sure if it was the last day or not. The jury determining Sam Bankman-Fried's fate had begun deliberating the charges just a few hours before, after Judge Lewis Kaplan had spent much of the morning and some time after lunch reading out a 60-page charging document. Surely a case of this complexity – seven different charges, billions of dollars allegedly stolen, questions about whether witnesses were telling the truth – would take a while.  But as the press pool enjoyed pizza and canned sodas (or their fourth? fifth? cup of coffee) last Thursday, there was a definite sense of finality in the air. Over the past month, some 20 or 30 of us had been reaching the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse in lower Manhattan before the sun rose. Reporters arrived at 5 a.m. – or earlier (way, way earlier) – to make it into the main courtroom or at least snag one of the better seats in the overflow room. By Thursday, all of that was done. There was no more testimony forthcoming, we'd seen all of the witnesses and so many exhibits had been introduced that the judge and attorneys had been cracking jokes about their volume.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Throughout October, many of us scrambled to file stories as news happened. Whether it was former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison testifying that Bankman-Fried had authorized an attempt to bribe Chinese government officials or an accountancy professor testifying about funds flowing through bank accounts, you could often step right outside the courthouse and see a line of reporters calling their editors, typing up their notes or recording podcasts wherever they found a spot.  Every news organization had its own particular method. CoinDesk sought to provide real-time updates as we could, sending reporters out to file stories while testimony was still underway, similarly to many of our colleagues. Other news organizations published broader takeaways at the end of a trial day. Some posted their works early the next morning. It really was a microcosm of the world of journalism.  And though we were competitors, there was also a strong sense of camaraderie among the different news organizations that were regularly represented. Many of us showed up in the dark of night and just hung out until the court would let us in shortly before 8 a.m. There wasn't much else to do besides chat, maybe catch up on some reading, fill out a crossword, go for a coffee run (or in one case, an actual run) or talk about LEGO (iykyk).  Because of the way the court operated, how exactly we operated ended up strangely regimented. The line outside the courthouse organized itself by the first 20 or so to show up a few minutes before the doors opened. Once inside, we lined up again, waiting for the actual courtrooms to open around 9 a.m. We had lunch at specific times, we left as a group and we'd do it all again the next day.  When exactly we showed up changed. Early on, reporters and the few odd members of the public got there around 4 or 5 a.m. and it was fine. Sadly, this state of affairs didn't last. Katie Baker, a features writer with The Ringer, called the arrival time ""a rapidly moving target.""  ""I live in a ski town, and there’s truly just one simple trick to getting the best spot in the lift line on a powder day: arrive before everyone else,"" she said. ""What made the SBF trial a particularly hectic challenge, though, was that 'before everyone else' was a rapidly moving target – a Jane Street Capital interview question of a logistical decision, come to think of it!""  People lined up as early as the night before to hear Bankman-Fried himself testify. On Friday, the first full day he spoke, more than 100 people were in line by 9 a.m., vastly outstripping the number of people who showed up early to watch Ellison or other FTX insiders.  Brady Dale, a former CoinDesker who's now part of the Axios Crypto reporting team, said he showed up at 2 a.m. one day. The temperature was around 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) that night – not that cold, on the face of it.  ""Here's the thing. What isn't that cold to you when you're just outside for 10 or 20 minutes becomes quite cold when you're outside for seven hours,"" he said. ""You've got a little light armor of warmth on the edge of your skin that protects you when you hit the cold. Fifty is high enough that it leaches the heat out slowly, but it does leach it out. You will get crazy cold after a couple hours.""  Baker, who arrived similarly early some of the nights, noted that it rained during at least one of the nights she showed up early:  ""It wasn’t necessarily fun to spend an entire workday waiting in the rain to begin my workday, but also … it kind of was? I loved getting deeply acquainted with so many brilliant reporters (even the ones whose names I was too embarrassed to ask because by that point I had seen and spoken to them every day for weeks) and sampling all the breakfast sandwiches the Southern District of New York has to offer. It was an honor to hurry up and wait with you all.""  And yeah, it was fun (I say as someone who usually never showed up before 5, and occasionally didn't make it until closer to 8:30 on less-busy days).  Aleks Gilbert, a reporter with DL News, called covering the trial ""one of the highlights of my career,"" citing both the magnitude of the trial as well as the morning scrum.  ""The conversations were often the same: 'man, I’m tired' or 'gee, it’s cold this morning' or something about the cast of courtroom characters: the surly judge; the petite, coldblooded prosecutor; Sam’s parents; his overmatched attorneys,"" he said. ""But it was fine. After spending 12 to 16 hours each day (a) in the courthouse, (b) standing just outside it, or (c) writing about it, what else was there to talk about? A meteor could have hit D.C. and I wouldn’t have heard about it until I got in line the next morning.""  By 11 a.m. on Thursday, there was very little left to cover. There was a final argument from the DOJ, but it was brief. The jury charge, while important, didn't substantially differ from the proposals or hearings discussing them, so there was really only one news story left to write: Bankman-Fried guilty, or not guilty. Experienced court reporters explained that typically deliberations for a case of this complexity took days, certainly more than the four hours available Thursday. The fact that reading the charge itself didn't end before 3 p.m. suggested we were going to be back on Monday.  So we waited, and we had pizza.  And then, just 20 minutes before court was set to let out for the day, we heard the jury had reached a verdict and it would be announced in seven minutes.  A few hours later, the trial was over.  — Nikhilesh De  Editor's notes  Welcome, folks, to the final edition of this newsletter – for now.

HT, which recorded an all-time high of $34.8 in 2021, has now broken a persistent 12-month downtrend as the wider crypto market signals the etchings of bull market.  HTX advisor Justin Sun told CoinDesk that he ""has no idea"" why the token has risen so much.  Daily trading volume for HT has reached $32 million to mark the highest volume trading day since February. Last week's trading volume ranged between $2 million and $5 million as the token languished down at $2.40. The majority of that volume took place on HTX itself with the HT/USDT trading pair hitting $26 million over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  HT suffered a wave of sell pressure earlier this year after Li Wei, the brother of Huobi founder Li Lin, allegedly acquired tokens for ""zero cost"" and sold them for ""huge amounts of cash.""  There is no clear news catalyst for the recent rise in price, although the wider altcoin market has been buoyed by wider market optimism around the potential of a spot bitcoin [BTC] ETF being approved by the SEC.  The entire cryptocurrency market cap excluding BTC has risen from $505 billion to $631 billion since Oct. 20. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is currently trading at a 16-month high of $36,800.

However, the games store isn’t profitable, and gamers have been skeptical about Epic’s pivot-to-crypto in its store.  Business interest in crypto has also spread to the GTA franchise, with rumors that GTA VI will include some crypto element.  This comes as Ubisoft and Immutable announce that they are building “a new gaming experience that will further unlock the potential of Web3.” Details are scant at this time, but this would mark the second foray for Ubisoft into the world of crypto gaming — the first being an NFT companion experiment to 2021's free-to-play Ghost Recon: Breakpoint.  Setting aside the issue of if gamers are interested in crypto, some serious legal questions arise from this. Rockstar is a multibillion dollar game developer with a massive presence in the U.S., and it would be a high-profile target for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  “My preliminary view aligns with the notion that there’s a legal grey area, substantial enough for a powerhouse like Rockstar Games to hesitate before integrating any sort of virtual currency within their games or issuing one of their own,” Florida-based digital assets attorney John Montague, told CoinDesk.  “Their hesitation, I believe, likely stems from a fear of possible issuer liability, especially given the aggressive stance the SEC has taken in recent times—underscored by the ongoing situation with Coinbase,” he continued. “I understand their desire to be conservative, and the risk/reward for their shareholders may just not be there.”  But Montague says there might be a catch. The SEC has already addressed many of the questions surrounding GameFi in a no-action letter directed towards the crypto gaming project Pocket Full of Quarters – the only no-action letter available on the subject.  In the no-action letter, the SEC indicates that fixed-priced in-game tokens are not securities because they are used for game utility rather than investment; Montague explained a view that, while not definitive, is a key factor in current regulatory considerations.  However, the relevance of price fixing in the evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency space may be questionable and potentially burdensome for developers. DeFi is a term for financial activities carried out on the blockchain without financial intermediaries.  “Given the evolution of DeFi and the free-floating nature of cryptocurrency, I do not think the price fixing is a particularly relevant factor and really just results in additional development costs, API, and oracle costs for game developers integrating tokeneconomic structures,” he said.  Montague argues that there’s no actual investment happening, which fails to meet the first requirement of the Howey test.  “Nevertheless, there still remains much regulatory ambiguity that is preventing game developers from entering into the space, which I think is a very sensible approach until regulatory clarity is achieved,” he said.  Rockstar Games did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  The rules around GameFi are clearer in Asia  While Rockstar is a U.S. company, its Grand Theft Auto franchise is a worldwide sensation, and it needs to be cognizant of rules worldwide. Rockstar is no stranger to this, as it has had to censor parts of GTA V for release in certain countries to comply with their laws around entertainment and extreme content.  GameFi isn’t a new concept in some parts of Asia; variations of it, minus the blockchain component, have been tried decades ago.  South Korea’s Gaming Industry Promotion Act, specifically Article 32, prohibits game currencies from being cashed out, a law that has been used to block the distribution of play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity, as they are equated to gambling by the government, CoinDesk previously reported, while in Japan, certain in-game actions of such games might be deemed illegal gambling.  China has the most stringent restrictions, banning any gaming elements exchangeable for yuan and crypto trading, thereby eliminating the possibility of GameFi in the country. However, it’s unclear if GTA VI will even be allowed to be released there.  Regardless of the regulatory uncertainty around the world surrounding GameFi, Montague hopes it will one day be center stage in AAA games.  “I think GameFi is awesome and will eventually integrated into many titles in the future,” he said.

The analysts maintain their belief of a 90% chance that any of these funds get approved by January 2024. An Approval Order “Could” Occur This November In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Seyffart highlighted a new research note that he and Balchunas had just worked on. From their research, they noted that there is a “brief window” that allows the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve all 12 Spot Bitcoin ETF applications at once. Related Reading: Ethereum Failed Transactions: You Won’t Believe How Much Users Have Lost This brief window (which opens up on November 9) will last for at least eight days, before which it is almost possible for the SEC to approve all applications at once until next year. The reason for their assertion is that the SEC cannot approve an application that is in the comment stage. It so happens that the comment stage of the last applications that the SEC delayed ends on November 8, which is why they highlighted the window that starts from November 9. As to why the window is only going to last for about eight days, the SEC is expected to decide on Hashdex and Franklin’s application on November 17, which could put both applicants in the comment stage. This is because it is expected that the SEC will opt to delay its decisions on those funds and ask the general public for comments on them. Meanwhile, the analysts noted that this window only applies to the SEC approving all 12 applications at once. They explain that “theoretically,” the Commission could decide on the other applications from now until January 10, 2024, even if it chooses to delay its decision on Hashdex and Franklin’s application on November 17. Whatever happens, they still believe that there is a 90% chance that any of these funds get approved by January 10 next year. A Spot Bitcoin ETF Launch Isn’t So Straightforward When quizzed about how long it will take for these funds to launch after approval, Balchunas mentioned in an X post that he guessed that the “19b-4s” applications would be approved in the “not so distant future.” Then it will further take a while for the SEC to approve the “S-1s” after which it “would likely be days till launch.” Related Reading: XRP News: Ripple CEO Teases Major Announcements At Swell Event Seyffart also echoed similar sentiments as he stated that there are “two paths” that need to be completed before an ETF launches. One is the 19b-4 approval, after which the division of Corporation Finance at the SEC will still need to sign off on the S-1s. However, there is no sign that any of that has been done yet.

The communiqué came after the group's Competition Authorities and Policymakers’ Summit in Hiroshima, Japan discussed concerns arising from digital markets. The U.S. Justice Department’s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission participated in the summit.  ""In this context, G7 competition authorities and policymakers are using their enhanced skillsets to scan the horizon for early warning signs of conduct or market factors that might make markets tip or reduce contestability as well as to identify key technologies and issues that may raise competition concerns in the future,"" the communiqué said.  ""Digital markets can present competition concerns,"" the statement said. ""Markets characterized by network effects, economies of scale, digital ecosystems, and accumulations of large amounts of data can be prone to increasing or creating barriers to entry, tipping, and dominance.""  New technologies, in particular, can alter the competitive balance and lead to greater market domination by a smaller group of companies, according to the G7. The meeting concluded that it is essential for policymakers to understand emerging technologies to take swift and proportionate action to prevent harm.  ""As the digital economy evolves, new technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and metaverse are emerging, allowing some businesses developing or using those technologies to grow rapidly,"" the announcement said.  The meeting produced three documents – the communniqué, an inventory of new rules for digital markets prepared by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and an analytical note meant to be read with the inventory.  ""Despite differences in their regulatory models, all regimes in the Inventory share broadly similar concerns vis-à-vis certain digital firms and adopt similar approaches to identify them,"" the analytical note said.  Participants committed to share updates on legal reforms, policy advances, institutional changes, and enforcement developments to take timely enforcement and regulatory action to protect competition in digital markets.

Concerns around the refunds resurfaced last week as some members, such as @beaumont_dvd, said they were waiting for the self-claim refund site to open more than three months after MuesliSwap’s initial statements.  However, refunds for losses have been available and processed via opening a support ticket on the forum platform Discord MuesliSwap told @beaumont_dvd in a message viewed by CoinDesk. These would be processed by providing personal wallet details directly to the platform.  In contrast, the self-claim site would allow anyone to automatically connect to the Cardano network and receive the purported amount of Cardano’s ADA tokens said to be lost in the form of high fees.  The DEX is among the most-used platforms on the Cardano blockchain. It locks over $13 million in various tokens as of Thursday, data shows.  Scores of users in August reported they had been paying high fees in the form of slippage over a 12-month period, prompting an online backlash at the time.  MuesliSwap developers said then that the users lost money due to a “misunderstanding” about how slippage on the platform worked.  Market makers — or trading participants who fill buy and sell orders — were able to “fill the limit order and choose whether to return the additional slippage amount or retain the difference at their discretion, the team said at the time.  In trading, slippage refers to a market participant receiving a different trade execution price than intended due to factors such as available liquidity.

19967867,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559854,1699518623,"Why Did Bitcoin Price Soar To $36,800?","The Bitcoin price has seen a significant increase of more than 4% within the last 24 hours. The price has risen to $36,800. Several key factors have contributed to this rally. #1 Spot Bitcoin ETF Buzz The surge in BTC’s price can be attributed to renewed speculations about the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Yesterday, Bloomberg’s James Seyffart put out a new note, highlighting that the SEC is in a unique position within the next eight days where they could approve all 12 spot ETF applications, as Bitcoinist reported. Seyffart further pointed out that the SEC has the opportunity to approve 9 applications (excluding Global X Bitcoin Trust, Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, and Franklin Bitcoin ETF) at any point until January 10, 2024. Bloomberg’s Seyffart and Eric Balchunas still estimate a 90% chance of approval for at least some of the pending applications before January 10, 2024. Related Reading: Market Makers Bet Big On Bitcoin Price Surge: Expert The ETF buzz was further fueled by news that Grayscale is in active discussions with the SEC regarding the conversion of its GBTC trust into a spot ETF. Grayscale’s recent court victory over the SEC on August 29 has added to the anticipation. #2 Bitcoin Whales There has been a notable increase in activities by Bitcoin whales, which can be interpreted as a sign of market optimism. Crypto analyst MartyParty pointed out a pattern of substantial purchases, with a whale reportedly buying $15 million of BTC every three hours, suggesting anticipation of positive developments in the ETF front. Keith Alan from Firecharts observed that Bitcoin whales are actively shifting liquidity in the market, with noticeable changes in bid levels. He stated, “FireCarts shows BTC whales continuing to move liquidity around the order book. Bids that were moved down to $34k earlier have now returned to the $34.5k level.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Strengthens: Record High In Long-Term Holdings Signals Bullish Horizon Additionally, an increase in TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) buying on Coinbase has been reported. Crypto analyst Exitpump noted, “BTC Spot Delta: Someone on Coinbase twapping / market buying.” TWAP buying is a trading strategy used by big players to execute large orders in a way that aims to minimize price impact and achieve an average execution price close to the market average over a specified time period. #3 Short Squeeze The Bitcoin market has also experienced a significant short squeeze, with approximately $51 million in BTC short positions being liquidated today (according to Coinglass data, as of press time). This amount marks the largest short squeeze since October 23 and 24, when $161 million and $68.5 million in Bitcoin short positions were liquidated on consecutive days, leading to a substantial price increase of more than 18%. Today’s short squeeze certainly caught some traders on the wrong foot who believed that $36,000 – the previous range high – was a “safe” short trade. #4 Bitcoin Supply Dynamics The supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has been steadily decreasing, reaching a six-year low at the end of October. Daan Crypto Trades, a noted crypto trader, highlighted the downward trend in Bitcoin inflows to exchanges. He remarked: Bitcoin Exchange inflows have been trending down on the higher timeframe. Compared to for 2021-2022 there’s a clear trend down in BTC inflows to exchanges. Would expect that to start ticking back up once the bull market really gets going and people start taking profits. Furthermore, on-chain data reveals that a significant 76% of the Bitcoin supply is currently held by long-term holders, who haven’t moved their coins for over 155 days. Analyst Dylan LeClair emphasized the strength of hodlers, noting that a staggering 88.5% of the supply has remained static over the last three months. “The hilarious thing is that 88.5% of the Bitcoin supply hasn’t moved in the last three months. Wall Street is gonna have to really pump this thing to get hodlers to part with their coins,” LeClair stated. At press time, BTC traded at $36,585.

Bitcoin's 25-delta one-month call-put skew, which assesses the relative price of calls versus puts expiring in four weeks, has risen above 10%, reaching the highest since April 2021, according to data tracked by Amberdata. In other words, demand for calls or bullish bets is outpacing puts, offering downside protection.  With spot ETF optimism driving BTC above $36,800 on Thursday, investors have likely stopped selling calls above the cryptocurrency's spot price, a popular strategy to generate additional yield on top of coin holdings.  Meanwhile, speculators could be buying call options to have leveraged upside exposure. Longer duration call-put skews also show a bias for continued BTC strength over two, three, and six months.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market. A put option gives the right to sell.  Traders have been scrambling to buy call options for the past few weeks, leaving market makers with a significant amount of net short exposure above $36,000.

Liminal has already supported a CBI operation by assembling a specialized team that created multi-sig and multi-party computation wallets to store seized assets safely. The details of the operation were not made available. India has seen at least two major cryptocurrency scams in the recent past – A $300m scam in which 18 have been arrested and a $120m scam in which at least two were arrested.

The CBI doesn't typically provide details of ongoing investigations.

Short sellers – traders who made bets prices will fall – might be exiting positions in a rush known as a short squeeze, fueling the move higher. Data shows just under $50 million in liquidations occurred in a four-hour period during early Asian trading hours, creating a short squeeze that drove prices up. BTC surpassed $36,000 a few hours earlier for the first time in 18 months.  Read more: Ether Soars Above $2K as BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust Registered as Corporate Entity in Delaware  Bitcoin has surged recently amid optimism U.S. regulators will approve ETFs that hold BTC, something some experts believe will lure a flood of investment money into the original cryptocurrency. Those hopes increased Wednesday following a CoinDesk report that the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened talks with Grayscale Investments on the details of the company's application to convert its bitcoin trust, known as GBTC, into a bitcoin ETF.  Bitcoin short squeeze  A short squeeze is an unusual condition that triggers a rapid price rise in any asset – typically beginning when the price jumps higher unexpectedly and short sellers exit their positions, leading to a buying flywheel.  Over $21 million of those shorts were wiped on futures exchange BitMEX, followed by OKX and Binance. This suggests the move could have been driven by market trades based in Asia, where these exchanges enjoy a relatively large user base.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Bitcoin ETFs  Elsewhere, analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence doubled down on expectations of a spot bitcoin ETF approval in the U.S., reiterating a ""90% chance"" of a launch by January.  ""Delay orders were issued by the SEC for BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity & Valkyrie at the same time,"" analyst James Seyffart said in an X post.

19962497,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559833,1699506039,Ripple CEO Declares Intent To Bring XRP Battle To Supreme Court,"In a recent speech at the DC Fintech Week conference, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse addressed the company’s regulatory hurdles. He expressed his views on the cryptocurrency landscape in the United States. Ripple CEO Warns Of US Risking Market Share Loss According to a Fortune Magazine report, Garlinghouse acknowledged during his speech that despite Ripple’s success in court against the SEC, some US banks must be more cautious about engaging meaningfully with cryptocurrencies. Garlinghouse attributed this reluctance to the perception that the US government and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are “hostile to the crypto industry.” While Ripple’s court victory in July was seen as a positive development, Garlinghouse believes that the SEC’s overall approach, coupled with Chairman Gary Gensler’s characterization of crypto as the “Wild West,” is hindering the industry’s growth in the US. Related Reading: Bitcoin Parabolic Rally Above $600,000: Crypto Analyst Says It’s Closer Than You Think Garlinghouse emphasized that while the US has hostility towards crypto, other countries actively welcome crypto companies and investments by providing clear regulatory policies. As a result, the US risks losing its market share and failing to capitalize on its early advantage in the crypto space. Garlinghouse expressed his belief that the US can still become a leader in the industry but highlighted the urgency for clear and constructive regulatory frameworks to be established. CEO Vows To Escalate Legal Battle With SEC To Supreme Court Given the challenges faced in the US, Garlinghouse announced that Ripple would continue to expand its operations in other countries. He revealed that 80% of Ripple’s hiring in the current year will be conducted outside of the US, reflecting the company’s need to operate in more favorable regulatory environments. Garlinghouse emphasized the importance of creating a hospitable environment for innovation and growth, suggesting that the current hostility in the US hinders Ripple’s ability to operate effectively within the country. During the conference, Garlinghouse expressed his willingness to escalate Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC to the Supreme Court. Garlinghouse stated that Ripple is prepared to pursue legal avenues until a resolution is reached. This firm stance underscores Ripple’s commitment to addressing regulatory uncertainties surrounding XRP. Related Reading: Can Chainlink Reach $20 With Rollup Finance Partnership? Brad Garlinghouse’s remarks at the DC Fintech Week conference shed light on the ongoing regulatory challenges faced by Ripple and the wider cryptocurrency industry in the United States. Despite recent court victories, Ripple encounters obstacles due to perceived hostility and a lack of clear policy guidance. Garlinghouse’s readiness to escalate the legal battle to the Supreme Court demonstrates Ripple’s determination to seek a resolution and establish a constructive regulatory framework. As Ripple expands its operations globally, the hope remains that the US will adopt more welcoming and supportive regulations to foster innovation and maintain its competitive edge in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. As of the current market update, XRP is trading at $0.6902, indicating sideways price movement over the past 24 hours.

19960796,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559808,1699502454,Polygon Labs And NEAR Foundation Partner For zkWasm L2 Prover Integration,"Polygon Labs (MATIC) and the NEAR Foundation have recently announced their collaboration on the development of a zero-knowledge (ZK) prover for the WebAssembly (Wasm) blockchain. The alliance aims to “bridge the gap” between Wasm-based chains and the Ethereum ecosystem, providing customization and options for developers building with the Polygon CDK (Chain Development Kit). NEAR Foundation Joins Polygon As Core Contributor According to Polygon Labs’ announcement, introducing a zkWasm prover will enable developers utilizing Polygon CDK to choose from various provers when building their projects. This can be leveraged in various scenarios, including launching or migrating an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain or constructing a Wasm chain for closer alignment with Ethereum and access to liquidity. Related Reading: Exploring The Resurgence Of BNB: Unveiling The Force Behind Renewed Interest The zkWasm prover will serve as a new runtime, generating zero-knowledge proofs that validate the correctness of native Wasm runtime execution. This advancement is expected to enhance scalability and decentralization, bringing the NEAR protocol closer to Ethereum. As part of this partnership, the NEAR Foundation is set to become a core contributor to Polygon CDK, expanding the toolkit’s capabilities for developers. Sandeep Nailwal, the co-founder of Polygon, expressed pride in collaborating with NEAR on this research and emphasized the value of the zkWasm prover in providing developers with increased customization options. To provide further context, WebAssembly is a widely used framework for running complex programs in web browsers, offering performance comparable to native computer applications. In the context of Web3, the Wasm Virtual Machine serves as a runtime for blockchains like NEAR and Polkadot, differing from the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Scalability And Decentralization Boost? Per the announcement, in the future, an in-development interop layer will allow chains to join a unified ecosystem of Layer 2 solutions deployed through Polygon CDK. This ecosystem will encompass alternative layer-1 chains, EVM layer-2 solutions, and Wasm chains, providing interoperability and defragmentation of liquidity across different chains. Related Reading: Solana Whale Deposits $11M In SOL To Binance, Bearish Signal? Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol, expressed optimism about the collaboration, emphasizing that it will bring the benefits of zero-knowledge proofs not only to NEAR but to the entire Web3 ecosystem. Polosukhin stated: We are very excited to work with Polygon Labs to bring all the benefits of zero-knowledge proofs not just to NEAR but all of Web3. NEAR is integrating more with Ethereum by innovating in new research frontiers, and the shared expertise of these two teams will bring a much-needed expansion of the ZK landscape and defragmentation of liquidity across chains. And by creating and using the zkWasm prover, NEAR will also improve the scalability and decentralization of the NEAR L1. Overall, the collaboration between Polygon Labs and the NEAR Foundation holds significant implications for both protocols. Integrating the zkWasm prover will enhance the capabilities of Polygon CDK, providing developers with more options in building “custom blockchains.” Additionally, it will bring NEAR Protocol closer to Ethereum, expanding its interoperability and liquidity opportunities. As of the latest update, MATIC, the native token of Polygon, is on the verge of reaching the $0.800 level, a milestone that has not been attained since July. The token currently trades at $0.7903, showcasing a noteworthy upward trajectory. This positive movement is further bolstered by an impressive 11% uptrend recorded over the past 24 hours.

42419123,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDvQr,1699499553,Bitcoin Tops $36K as 'ETFs Not Yet Priced in',"The price of bitcoin [BTC] briefly touched $36,000 before settling slightly lower during the Asian trading hours on Thursday, according to CoinDesk Indices data.  Bitcoin is up around 30% in the last month, and 93% over the past year. Other large-cap digital assets are also in the green, with ether [ETH] up 20% in the last month.  While bitcoin’s gains this year have been impressive, and some have attributed this to the widely expected approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, in a recent interview with CoinDesk, Matt Hougan, Bitwise Asset Management’s Chief Investment Officer, said that an ETF is not yet priced in.  ""It’s not at all priced in because the people who are going to buy this ETF are not aware that it’s coming or most likely coming; the majority of advisors who are the natural audience for this ETF don’t expect it to come until 2025 or later,” Hougan said. “If the people who are going to buy this ETF don’t think it's going to be approved in the next two months, then I don’t see how it’s priced in.”  ETFs, Hougan argued, will play a significant role in opening up cryptocurrency investments to a broader range of investors, particularly financial advisors who manage a substantial portion of the U.S.' wealth.  Currently, crypto has been bought by 20% of self-directed retail investors, he said, but a full 80% of the wealth in America is controlled by financial advisors and institutions, who need an ETF to access crypto.  ""There’s a whole entire new audience for bitcoin,” he said, comparing it to the launch of gold ETFs in the early 2000s.  “The approval of a spot gold ETF in 2004 led to eight or nine consecutive years of gold price increases, the longest in its modern history since the dollar’s creation,"" he continued.  Hougan said that BlackRock’s filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in June had a significant psychological impact on the market, effectively dispelling the lingering negative sentiment from the FTX collapse, which he refers to as the “ghosts of Sam Bankman-Fried.”  “When BlackRock filed for a bitcoin ETF, and CEO Larry Fink spoke on Fox Business News about bitcoin transcending other currencies, concerns vanished,” he said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/09/bitcoin-tops-36k-as-etfs-not-yet-priced-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/119684f4317c9cdae13bf73c082666d73ae81d35-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19959302,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559818,1699498816,"Analyst Endorses MATIC, Time To Double Down On Polygon And Ethereum Layer-2 Tokens?","Ryan Sean Adams, a vocal Ethereum commentator and crypto investor, is bullish on MATIC, the native token of Polygon. Taking to X on November 8, Adams said MATIC should be a top-10 crypto asset, adding that people are asleep on layer-2s. Polygon (MATIC) Remains In An Uptrend When writing on November 8, MATIC is among the top 15 most valuable coins by market cap. It also remains volatile, fluctuating, and moving up and down the market cap leaderboard rankings. Even so, considering its spot valuation exceeding $7.3 billion according to CoinMarketCap (CMC), a crypto tracker, MATIC remains relatively liquid with a broad user base. Related Reading: Ethereum Failed Transactions: You Won’t Believe How Much Users Have Lost Etherscan data on November 8 shows that there are 629,967 MATIC holders, down roughly 2%, but the number remains higher despite the contraction following the crypto winter of 2022, which spilled over to 2023. As of November 8, MATIC is up 60% from September 2023 lows. According to CMC, the coin is also up 13% on the last trading day, pushing weekly gains to over 27%. Looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the uptrend momentum is strong, and buyers appear to be doubling down. Presently, bull bars are aligned along the upper BB, suggesting that there is intense buying pressure. At the same time, MATIC is within a bullish breakout formation, breezing past August highs. Polygon, a sidechain, is among the many scaling solutions for Ethereum. The platform is compatible with Ethereum, allowing protocols to build on Polygon while enjoying the high activity and security of the first smart contract network. Polygon is also considered a layer-2, though it isn’t technically a layer-2 since it doesn’t depend on roll-ups like Arbitrum or OP Mainnet. Time To Double Down On MATIC And Layer-2 Tokens In Adams’ view, considering layer-2 tokens, including MATIC or ARB, at spot levels could translate to more gains in the next bull run. Nonetheless, it should be noted that MATIC, for instance, is down 72% from 2021 highs. Moreover, the coin is trending inside June’s bear trade range. A comprehensive close above this level may signal the end of the bear run, possibly anchoring buyers targeting $1.5. In late October, Polygon Labs officially launched the POL, a token that will prime Polygon 2.0, Ethereum, signaling the first steps to see MATIC gradually phased out. POL will serve more roles in Polygon 2.0, specifically powering an ecosystem of zero knowledge-based layer-2 chains using Polygon’s infrastructure. News of this smart contract launch seemed to have catalyzed demand, driving token prices higher.

This marks the first time that Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum in this aspect. BTC’s NFT Breakthrough Bitcoin’s recent achievement of surpassing Ethereum in 24-hour NFT sales volume signals a changing trend and growing interest in the NFT market. While Ethereum has long been recognized as the dominant blockchain for NFTs, Bitcoin’s entrance into the space demonstrates its increasing relevance and appeal to NFT enthusiasts and collectors. The data highlights that Bitcoin accounted for $17,291,694 in NFT sales, with 575 buyers participating. On the other hand, Ethereum recorded $26,689,252 in total sales, with 11,225 buyers. Despite Ethereum maintaining a higher total sales figure, the relatively lower wash percentage of Bitcoin suggests a potentially healthier and more organic market activity. However, when it comes to volatility, data from Deribit, the leading crypto derivatives exchange, shows that the spread between ETH and BTC volatility, commonly referred to as the ETH DVOL vs. BTC DVOL spread, has narrowed significantly since October 23rd from -11.6 to just -0.6. This shift indicates a change in investor sentiment and increased attention towards Ethereum and altcoins. Related Reading: Dogecoin In Tight Zone: Why A Rally Will Happen If DOGE Clears $0.076 In light of this development, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin over the past fourteen days. ETH has seen significant price movement, gaining over 2% in the last 24 hours, 6% in the last seven days, and 4% in the last fourteen days, bringing its current price to $1,899. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has exhibited a slowdown in its upward momentum and is currently consolidating above $35,400. It has seen a 2% increase in the past 24 hours, 3% in the past seven days, and 1% in the fourteen-day timeframe. However, it is important to note that BTC has gained more than 82% year-to-date, while ETH has only increased by 30% during the same period, according to CoinGecko data. Nasdaq 100 Correlation With Bitcoin Plummets According to recent Kaiko data, BTC has witnessed a significant decline in its correlation with traditional assets throughout the year. One notable development is the diminishing correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 index. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s 60-day correlation with the Nasdaq 100 has substantially declined, plunging from over 70% in September 2022 to approximately 19% as of last week. Bitcoin’s negative correlation with the US dollar, which ranged from 40% to 50%, has also weakened. Currently, the correlation is around 11%, signifying a reduced tendency for Bitcoin’s value to move in the opposite direction of the US dollar. Related Reading: Ethereum Failed Transactions: You Won’t Believe How Much Users Have Lost While Bitcoin’s correlation with gold has seen some upward momentum since August, the average correlation throughout the year has remained relatively low at 12%.

Radiant Capital Earnings Rising: What’s The Trigger? According to Token Terminal statistics on November 8 shared by one user on X, @Flowslikeosmo, Radiant Capital generated $5.8 million in revenue despite a relatively lower level of liquidity than Aave. @Flowslikeosmo, who claims to be a crypto researcher, said Radiant Capital’s earnings will likely explode in the upcoming sessions, especially once the 2.8 million ARB begins to be deployed. Radiant Capital is a popular cross-chain decentralized money market through which users, regardless of their choice blockchain, can either lend their assets and earn passive income or borrow assets trustlessly. This way, the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol has opened up liquidity and boosted access to multiple blockchains. Related Reading: Dogecoin In Tight Zone: Why A Rally Will Happen If DOGE Clears $0.076 To perform effectively, the protocol relies on LayerZero, which enables trustless and decentralized communication between blockchains using Oracle Relays, allowing platforms to be more interconnected and ledgers to be more interoperable. As Radiant Capital offers services, the DeFi protocol generates earnings or revenue primarily from fees. The platform charges a protocol fee on all transactions. Earnings from this allow the team to be operational while allowing the protocol to generate revenue. However, it should be noted only 15% of this fee is used to cover operational expenditure, with the rest redistributed to users as yield. Besides, there are fees billed to users taking flash loans. The protocol rewards providers with RDNT to incentivize liquidity provision, depending on the amount provided and the duration locked. ARB Airdrop, Will RNDT Rally To New 2023 Highs? Earnings generated depend on the activity level, directly influencing protocol fees accrued and the number of users taking flash loans. Following Radiant Capital’s recent announcement that it plans to airdrop 2 million ARB following the Arbitrum DAO‘s approval of a proposal first floated in late September, activity could skyrocket in the coming months, boosting earnings. Related Reading: Solana Whale Deposits $11M In SOL To Binance, Bearish Signal? Moreover, the protocol’s liquidity is expected to increase with this approval.

According to Dune Analytics data, the number of RDNT holders continues to rise, mirroring its general price performance. Thus far, RDNT is up 40% from October lows.

19954751,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559795,1699488010,Bitcoin’s Grip Strengthens: Record High In Long-Term Holdings Signals Bullish Horizon,"Amid fluctuating markets and economic uncertainty, Bitcoin long-term investors hold their coins tighter than ever. Data from blockchain analysis firm Glassnode reveals a notable trend: a significant portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is firmly in the hands of long-term holders, with figures reaching record heights. Notably, the trend of Bitcoin being tightly held is not a new phenomenon, but the level of accumulation we’re witnessing today appears unprecedented. Glassnode’s research points out that the community of long-term Bitcoin holders is not just growing but doing so at an “impressive rate of accumulation.” This cohort’s commitment is evidenced by the historical highs in key supply metrics—illiquid supply, coins held (HODLed), and long-term holder supply—are all at their peak, according to shared Glassnode insights. Related Reading: Bitcoin On The Brink? Analyst Predicts Soaring Open Interest May Signal 20% Price Correction A Dive into Bitcoin’s Illiquid Supply Glassnode’s briefing depicted the Bitcoin market’s current state. The data illustrates that 68% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply has not moved for more than a year, indicating a decision by investors to hold through volatility and market dips. The metric for coins held for over five years is even more telling, constituting nearly a third of all Bitcoin in circulation. In terms of Bitcoin’s illiquid supply—coins held in wallets with little to no spending history—the figures are also at an all-time high, with over 15.4 million BTC firmly held. This illiquidity is not a static condition as it is growing monthly at 71,000 Bitcoin, according to Glassnode’s analysis. According to a Glassnode analyst, this accumulation has coincided with a notable pattern of investors pulling their Bitcoin from exchanges into private custody, further solidifying the trend of long-term holding. The analyst disclosed: The data suggests investors are continuing to withdraw their coins into custody, with over 1.7 million bitcoin doing so since May 2021. Bitcoin: Divergence In Holders And Latest Price Action Glassnode’s report also highlights a significant divergence between the behaviors of long-term and short-term Bitcoin holders. While long-term supply is seeing historic highs, short-term holder supply is at record lows, indicating a change in spending habits after the currency’s surge above the pivotal $30,000 benchmark. Glassnode’s analysis suggests this price point is a crucial battleground for bullish sentiment, marking a potential inflection point in the market’s trajectory.
