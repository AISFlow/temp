42398862,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh76w,1454778017,"Bitcoin, Online Payments and the Scourge of PayPal","From 2003 t0 2012, I built up and ran a technology blog called ReadWriteWeb (RWW). At its peak, it had over 20 people working for it, nearly all of them in the US.  The fact I could manage this business virtually, from New Zealand, showed the power of the Internet tools the blog evangelized. The RWW team communicated via Skype. We published on Movable Type. We managed projects on Basecamp. We scheduled meetings with GoToMeeting. We kept track of the editorial calendar using Google Calendar.  There was, however, one crucial component missing in our virtual office: a decent tool for online payments. And we had to do a lot of online payment processing; paying staff and accepting payments from our sponsors being the two most important. The closest we got to a viable tool was PayPal, but we quickly learned to avoid it.  PayPal's fees for international payments were (and still are) exorbitant. What we ended up using was the international banking system, SWIFT. It was full of red tape, the bank's online software was buggy, and often we found that one or more intermediary banks had taken a chunk of money during the process.  In short, the banking system was opaque and frustrating… but even then it was better than PayPal.  My overly long point is this: Online payments aren’t yet solved. Bitcoin may be the solution.  The promise of a PayPal killer  Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency.  As I type this, its value is $372.57. It fluctuates a lot, which is part of the reason it’s not quite ready to be a PayPal killer. But the underlying system is solid.  I won’t go into the technical definition of bitcoin, but simply put, there are two main uses for bitcoin currently:  As a digital asset, similar to holding gold or trading foreign currencies. You can either buy bitcoins or ""mine” them for this purpose. (Currently being a digital asset is by far bitcoin’s main use case).  As a form of online payment. This is still a minority activity with Bitcoin, but as the currency stabilises, this use case will become more prominent.  What makes bitcoin more appealing than PayPal or credit cards?  For a start, the fees are much less extravagant. You may not even need to pay any transaction fee, although bitcoin's website suggests that paying a small fee could speed up the transaction.  Bitcoin is also appealing because it is essentially a universal currency. So, there aren’t onerous currency conversion procedures to go through – which are always a 'gotcha' with international bank transfers, PayPal transactions and credit card payments.  Who accepts bitcoin?  A number of mainstream goods and services websites have begun to accept bitcoin as payment — including WordPress, OKCupid, Expedia and Microsoft.  Perhaps the biggest retailer so far is Overstock, which began accepting bitcoin in January 2014.  The founder of Overstock, Patrick Byrne, tweeted that month:    #Bitcoin's first full day on @overstock.com was a huge success: 840 orders, $130,000 in sales. Almost all new customers. #stunned        — Patrick Byrne (@OverstockCEO) January 10, 2014      Byrne is a big advocate of bitcoin, although it should be noted that Overstock itself does not accept bitcoin. Instead it partnered with a third-party company, Coinbase, to accept bitcoin on its behalf. Coinbase then pays Overstock in US dollars, though it does keep some bitcoin reserves.  This way Overstock avoids the risks of holding bitcoin – especially the volatility of bitcoin's value.  So if you're a retail company or startup, or offering services online, should you accept bitcoin? It can't hurt to add it as an option, although Overstock's experience suggests that it's not straightforward to set up.  Paying in bitcoin  What about from the other side of the coin (so to speak). Should you use bitcoin as a consumer? It’s a viable option if you live in a country that makes it easy for you to purchase bitcoin.  Unfortunately, my own country is not one of those. Foiled again! But those of you in the US and much of Europe are well served with bitcoin vendors.  Coinbase is one of the most established bitcoin ventures. Backed by VC luminaries like Fred Wilson and Chris Dixon, Coinbase offers a bitcoin buy and sell exchange as well as a ""wallet"" to hold your bitcoins (similar to a bank account).  But even if you have access to a slick service like Coinbase, there are risks in using bitcoin to purchase goods and services. Apart from the volatility of the price, there is a lack of consumer protection.  As the US Federal Trade Commission warned in June 2015:  ""…payments made with virtual currencies aren't reversible and don't have the same legal protections as some traditional payment methods. Once you hit send, you can’t get your money back unless the seller agrees.""  The opportunities  It's clear that bitcoin isn't ideal for online payments at this time.  As a retailer, compared to existing currencies it's not straight forward to receive payment in bitcoin. And as a consumer, it isn't universally available and (where it is available) it carries risks.  But that's one reason why startups exist: to overcome obstacles to adoption of a new technology. There are opportunities for startups to make it easier for retailers and consumers, and to widen access to the exchange of bitcoin.  One particular use case I'm excited about with bitcoin is its potential to enable the long sought after business model of micropayments. This is the practice of paying a tiny amount for a good or service.  For example, paying $0.10 cents to read an article on a news website. Because of ad blockers and the rapid decline of online advertising revenue, publishers are currently struggling.  Micropayments perhaps offers an alternative revenue source. At the very least, it’s worth experimenting with and I applaud startups that are putting forward potential solutions.  One such startup is called SatoshiPay. It's named after bitcoin’s mythical creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Also, ""satoshi"" is the accepted term for the smallest fraction of a bitcoin: currently set at 0.00000001 BTC.  SatoshiPay bills itself as an enabler of ""bitcoin nanopayments"" and asks us to ""imagine a web where you can purchase an article, image or video for 1 cent."" It’s early days for the company – it only just announced its seed funding – but SatoshiPay is a good example of how bitcoin could drive innovation in online payments.  Conclusion  In conclusion, bitcoin isn’t yet ready to dethrone PayPal as king of online payments.  Indeed PayPal itself may yet evolve into a key bitcoin payments processing company – although CoinBase has gotten the first mover advantage on that front. But once bitcoin’s volatility settles down (which may be a while, on the evidence of a recent schism in its developer ranks), bitcoin has clear technical advantages over PayPal, banks and credit cards for online payments.  One thing is for certain: bitcoin is in the process of disrupting Paypal. And for that we should be thankful.

42398868,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh79t,1454771718,Bitcoin Earns Reputation for Poor Payments Standards Participation,"When it comes to online payment standards, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is finding it difficult to engage the bitcoin community.  ""It's proven easier to get a bank to participate in payments standards than a bitcoin community company,"" says Manu Sporny, chairman of the W3C Web Payments community group and founder and CEO of web platform startup Digital Bazaar.  Because it's still early days for the bitcoin industry, he says, these companies aren’t looking to interoperate, but instead want to dominate the web payments market.  Founded by Web creator Tim Berners-Lee, the W3C is the preeminent organization for developing international standards for the web. Its work in online payments started about five years ago with a simple goal – sending a payment should be as easy as sending an email in the digital world, a value proposition familiar to many bitcoin enthusiasts.  Toward this end, the group has discussed how to ease the process of adding new payment mechanisms to the web, expanding consumer choice. But web payments groups have struggled to get participation from the bitcoin industry.  When competing at the standards level, the blockchain community is of the verge of creating the same ""walled gardens that we're always criticizing on the Internet,"" says Primavera de Filippi, founder of COALA, a research and development initiative for blockchain technologies that also set up a W3C community group on crypto-ledger solutions.  Saket Sharma, chief information officer at BNY Mellon's Treasury Services unit called out similar drawbacks of working without a standard. ""So the underlying technology itself is so fluid that there’s no stack as a standard, right? So unless you have a standard, you will not be able to interoperate, eventually,"" Sharma told CoinDesk this week.  The decision could also hamper the technology's pervasiveness.  ""[Bitcoin] is not going to be as big as the Internet if they don’t start coordinating on some core standards,"" Sporny says.  Cycle repeating  Sporny likens the issue to the web browser battle in the mid-1990s.  During that time, Netscape, built by Marc Andreessen – whose venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has invested in Coinbase and 21 Inc among other bitcoin startups – was competing against Microsoft, which owned the majority of web browsing sessions.  According to Sporny, Microsoft opposed standardization, which in turn led to significant backlash.  Eventually standards were created making it easy and accessible for competing web browsers to start up and advance the technology.  ""These things tend to go through cycles: one player takes over the market centralizing it, then there are calls for standards to break that up and decentralize things so people can compete,"" Sporny says.  The problem with centralizing an Internet system is that it can result in a single point of failure.  For instance, he says if sidechains are only built off the bitcoin blockchain, and the blockchain then failed for some reason, all the sidechains it was connected to could go down as well.  Instead, he argues a decentralized solution would allow the creation of separate blockchains that can all communicate with each other.  Payment agnostic  While recent reports have claimed that the W3C is bullish on bitcoin and blockchain technology, Sporny says, ""Web payment isn’t focused on ledgers and decentralized clearing and assets.""  Ian Jacobs, W3C payments activity lead, commented:  ""To the extent that there are new payment methods, we’d like to make sure those payment methods are accepted online … and various payment flows are supported. We don’t favor bitcoin any more than we favor credit cards.""  But there are a number of people within the Web Payments group talking about bitcoin and how the protocol could be useful for solving some web technology problems, Jacobs says.  While the W3C would welcome members of the bitcoin community, Jacobs says: ""We have not seen the bitcoin community flock to the W3C to do work.  Because executives from Ripple and members of Ethereum have joined the Web Payments work to discuss their alternative cryptographic payments protocols, Sporny thinks the rationale is a bit different within the bitcoin industry.  He believes there's a tendency from within the industry to see bitcoin as the standard other blockchains will be built around.  ""The bitcoin community seems to have a chip on their shoulder,"" Sporny says. ""The hype around bitcoin is a big part of it. Bitcoin didn’t exist a few years ago and now it’s this big thing with venture capitalists and companies throwing money at bitcoin startups. That tends to embolden people.""  Sporny’s sentiment stems from several years of reaching out to industry stakeholders and getting ignored or rejected.  For instance, he had a conversation with a large, venture capital-funded bitcoin company that seemed interested, but the lead developer became dismissive about standards and how long the process takes, he says.  However, it’s just as likely that cost is a prevailing factor.  ""Startups rarely collaborate,"" says Erik Anderson, co-chair of the Web Payments interest group and a researcher and developer at Bloomberg. ""Startups are generally being directed by their investors towards developing a single, universal use case their existing technology can be applied to. Startups need to show investors short-term value.""  To be a member of a W3C working group, startups pay $2,000 for a two-year membership. Annual fees for more established companies range from $8,000 for small organizations and nonprofits to $88,000 for large organizations like Google and Microsoft.  Members also send an employee to work on the project, and those fees then go back to the members of the group. The W3C puts working group staff on at a 50% full-time employee rate, which Sporny says, amounts to tens of thousands of dollars per year.  Control over standards  Standards work has never been easy. It’s slow because it rides on consensus, and issues frequently become contentious.  But ultimately the W3C has continued to be an influential player in the Internet standards and technology space. Several thousands of engineers from organizations around the world work in W3C groups, many of whom are the same people that crafted the standards for the open, robust web we see today.  The Web Payments working group will be meeting in mid-February in San Francisco to go over two proposals for web payment API infrastructure. A month later, the group should have a working document of the API.  During the meeting, stakeholders will also be trying to decide on the group’s next priority, ranging from verifiable credentials; regulatory changes in Europe; coupons built on the API layer; Fed faster payments and blockchain initiatives – including Interledger, a protocol created by Ripple but that now is an open, community effort, and bitcoin for peer-to-peer payments via mobile devices.  The Web Payments group has continued to see momentum; currently it has 175 members made up of some of the biggest names from all areas of the payment chain, including Alibaba Group, Apple Inc, Google and Visa Europe. Plus several large merchants and mobile telcos have joined the group.  But momentum for the standardization of blockchain or distributed ledger solutions is unlikely to happen soon. Sporny sees banks and legacy payment providers as more interested in investing in companies like R3.  Banks would prefer to own the ledger solution as a value add, he continued, adding:  ""A lot of this has to do with control.""
