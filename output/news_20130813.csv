42416869,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxcsM,1376424531,Private and secure file storage service SpiderOak to accept bitcoin,"Just days after two secure email services shut down over fears of US government pressure, secure file storage service SpiderOak is to launch a pilot program to accept bitcoin.  The company, which enables users to store their files securely while retaining control of their own encryption keys, offers a standard free service providing 2GB of secure storage for life. This pilot will see it offer 25 account upgrades to its 100 GB service for a year, according to spokesperson Daniel Larsson.  “The potentially anonymous and proof-centric nature of cryptographic currencies certainly ties into our overall messaging. Based on all of the above, it seems rather natural to at least start experimenting with cryptocurrencies as a form of payment,” says Larsson, adding that the pilot is designed to gauge interest in a potential fully-developed bitcoin API for the system.  “The choice of bitcoin was easy as it is the most widely adopted cryptocurrency and is also the only one directly exchangeable for fiat (USD), should we decide that we want to move towards larger scale acceptance.”  The company has been privately promising a blog post launching the pilot for several days. It was delayed over the weekend due to the news that Silent Circle would be shuttering its secure email service.  That company, founded in part by Phil Zimmermann, the father of the renowned PGP encrypted communication technology, operated a service that enabled users to send secure emails without having their private encryption keys managed by a central service. Silent Circle cited concerns that the Internet protocols underpinning its mail service were too insecure to guarantee the privacy of information sent that way. ""Email as we know it with SMTP, POP3, and IMAP cannot be secure,"" it said. There’s an interview with Zimmerman here.  Silent Circle shuttered its service in response to the closure of another secure communications service, Lavabit, allegedly used by whistleblower Edward Snowden as recently as March. Lavabit owner Ladar Levison decided to shut down after ten years, explaining that he was legally prevented from talking about why, and promising to defend the Constitution in the Court of Appeals. All of this led the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to suggest that government pressures and gag orders were involved, and to call for more transparency.  SpiderOak is different from Silent Circle and Lavabit, in that it only offers file storage, rather than secure email or other forms of secure, private communication. But they all have one thing in common: their key selling point is that they couldn’t decrypt your data, even if they wanted to. SpiderOak and Silent Circle don’t hold a user’s private encryption keys centrally. Instead, they allow the users to control the keys on their own local devices, which is important, because it makes security more decentralized.  If data is encrypted by a service provider that also holds those encryption keys centrally, then there is a danger that a third party could force that service provider to give up the keys, enabling it to decrypt your data. Security researchers have criticized mainstream service Dropbox for just this reason.  Lavabit did handle private keys centrally (see archived explanation here), but it encrypted the keys themselves using the user’s password. That meant that if a third party was able to intercept communications between its network and the user (or even compromise the user’s computer) and obtain the password, it could potentially decrypt the user’s data, because it could descramble the centrally-encrypted key.  These are not theoretical concerns. All of this comes at a time of heightened tensions over government interference in online services including social networks and email. Snowden went public with information about PRISM, an NSA surveillance operation said to involve many large online service providers, including Google, Microsoft, and Apple.  “I think a lot of people, at least before the PRISM news broke, lived with the belief that the Internet was just 'too big to police' and felt a somewhat false sense of security that as long as they 'did nothing wrong', they were still anonymous,” says Larsson.  “For the general public, the realization that any data they store or transmit online can and likely will be intercepted and at least indexed by government agencies is likely something that will fuel a newfound interest in security and privacy technology.”  The idea behind marrying bitcoin with a service like SpiderOak is that, managed properly, a user could not only completely encrypt the data, but also use the service entirely anonymously.  And, while two anonymous communications services closed last week, there is another alternative: Bitmessage, the secure communications network based on the Bitcoin protocol. Demand for this service is increasing. This chart shows hourly messages processed by the network since July 16 until midnight on August 12. The first big spike occurs around August 6, a couple of days before Lavabit’s Levison publicly pulled the plug.  As decentralized secure communication services begin disappearing, those with a reason to use them will flee to the few still available. The question is, if more of them begin using decentralized systems for communication, will authorities be able to compromise them, or force them out of operation? The less centralized the system, the more difficult that will be.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/13/private-and-secure-file-storage-service-spideroak-to-accept-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e1bc58e639777f7ebf55dfe4b782cc68a5d1729a-1372x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416860,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxca4,1376409537,Lavabit and Silent Circle shut down encrypted email services,"Lavabit and Silent Circle have both closed down their encrypted email services amid suggestions the US government was demanding the companies sacrifice their customers' privacy.  The Lavabit site now features only a statement from its owner and operator Ladar Levison, which begins:  ""I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly ten years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit. After significant soul searching, I have decided to suspend operations. I wish that I could legally share with you the events that led to my decision. I cannot.""  He goes on to say that, regardless of the first amendment guaranteeing the freedom of speech in the US, congress has passed laws to prevent him from sharing his experiences over the last six weeks.  Levison said he has already started preparing the paperwork required to fight at the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals for Lavabit to continue operating as an American company.  ""This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would _strongly_ recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States,"" his statement concludes.  ""I would _strongly_ recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States."" - Ladar Levison, Lavabit  Shortly after the closure of Lavabit, which was reportedly used by whistleblower Edward Snowden during his time stuck at a Moscow airport, encrypted communications firm Silent Circle shut down its Silent Mail service. The homepage of its website reads:  ""We see the writing on the wall, and we have decided that it is best for us to shut down Silent Mail. We have not received subpoenas, warrants, security letters, or anything else by any government, and this is why we are acting now.""  Simon Lang, digital forensics manager at Sytech Consultants, said the situation surrounding the closure of Lavabit and Silent Mail ""sounds a bit like a witch hunt"".  ""There are many companies who make high profile encryption tools - Microsoft being one of them - who aren't being legally pursued. It is clear to me that Lavabit and Silent Circle have been put under investigation because they refused to hand over their customers' data on demand and break the promises made to users,"" he added.  Lavabit and Silent Circle have connections with bitcoin inasmuch as they all allow users to operate privately. Lang doesn't believe, however, that these recent events should cause any concern to those operating bitcoin-related businesses.  The company is currently collecting donations to its legal fees fund via PayPal, but members of the bitcoin community are urging Lavabit to accept donations in digital currency too.  Those seeking an alternative may wish to consider Bitmessage, an anonymous, encrypted messaging service built on the Bitcoin protocol. Mailpile could be another option, when it launches. This webmail client is still fundraising and is accepting donations in bitcoin as well as traditional currency. It hopes to reach its $100,000 goal by September 10th. CounterMail, however, is already up and running and also allows users to communicate securely with other open PGP-compatible email users.  The Heml.is app is also on its way, offering users the chance to send short instant messages safe in the knowledge that they've not been intercepted or read by a third party.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/13/lavabit-and-silent-circle-shut-down-encrypted-email-services,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22be4f1ef42e6f13340ebcac276a287186595dcd-1000x716.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416856,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxcTy,1376393158,Lamassu is now taking pre-orders for its bitcoin ATM,"Lamassu, the maker of a bitcoin ATM, are now taking pre-orders for the ATM which was demonstrated at the Bitcoin London conference. The ATM is designed to scan a QR code of customers' wallets and accept a bank note.  Zach Harvey, one of Lamassu's partners, told us: ""We're very excited about beginning to accept pre-orders and moving closer and closer to shipping the Bitcoin Machines around the world. The idea now is the same as when we first started this project, to make Bitcoin more accessible to the masses"".  In terms of demand for the ATM, Harvey told us that there have been 150 enquiries from over 40 countries. When asked when Lamassu expect to start shipping, Harvey said: ""Being carefully optimistic, I think we will start seeing the first Bitcoin Machines deployed this October"".  Harvey wouldn't give exact figures on the pre-orders received so far, but described them as ""going very well"" and that ""orders are from multiple countries including Canada, Finland, Slovakia, New Zealand and Denmark"". Those who are ordering the ATM were described by Harvey as ""bitcoin entrepreneurs that either already have bitcoin businesses or want to get into the bitcoin world"".  The ATM is a low-powered device, consuming ""about the power needed for a consumer tablet"". When asked about the best place to install them, he told us: ""We recommend installing the Bitcoin Machine in an indoor attended retail environment. It is meant to resist smash-and-grab attacks, but not meant to be left outside at night"".  In terms of using the ATM, it's expected that customers will have a wallet app on their smartphones that can present a QR code for their wallet address (but a paper wallet should work too). Once scanned, the customer will be asked to insert a bank note into the slot. The device will then detect the value of the note and advise the customer the amount of BTC they'll receive.  Even though there's a touch screen with a virtual button to ""Send Coins"", the transaction is final once the note is taken. Harvey told us that if the customer fails to touch the screen, it will time out and send the bitcoins anyway.  Businesses deploying an ATM will also have to configure their own bitcoin exchange system. Lamassu is not trading or converting bitcoin for ATM users.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/13/lamassu-is-now-taking-pre-orders-for-its-bitcoin-atm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8688e2d7459b02fea037959ae98aef232a503f3-998x666.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416857,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxcW0,1376391209,Defcon hackers crack physical bitcoin Casascius coins,"The Casascius coin was shown to be vulnerable to physical attack at this year's Defcon conference, one of the world's largest hacker conventions. Casascius coins are one form of physical bitcoin, being supplied in denominations of 0.5, 1 and 25 BTC. The coins each have a private key printed on them, concealed by a holographic sticker. The Defcon hackers were able to reveal the key and replace the stick with virtually no sign of tampering.  The private key on each Casascius coin relates to the bitcoin address that holds the value of the coin. The implication of having access to this coin is that the balance of the coin's address could be altered. This could either be to increase the value so as to smuggle money – or more likely to remove the BTC value from the coin before passing the coin along to anyone who accepts it as currency.  According to the Coding in my Sleep blog, the ""physical attack"" was performed by using a hypodermic needle to inject what was described as a ""non-polar solvent"" between the coin's holographic sticker and brass surface. The solvent had the effect of neutralising the adhesive, thus allowing the sticker to be non-destructively removed.  The private key could then be easily read, and the sticker replaced with new adhesive. The only sign of tampering was a small deformation where the needle had stretched the sticker during insertion – a mark which could be mistaken for normal wearing.  Information security expert Vladimir Marchenko, told us: ""From the very beginning, when Casascius coins were announced I was rather skeptical about this project due to information security concerns. It was clear that if one hides a private key in a physical object there might be a cost-effective non-destructive method to discover the key or otherwise 'counterfeit' the coin.  ""Moreover, there is no secret service to go after 'attackers' unlike a case with floating rate notes. With only purely technical measures there will always be a shield-and-sword kind of antagonism, but in this case even temporary advantage of attackers is unacceptable. Today it is chemicals, tomorrow it might be some kind of X-ray analysis detecting traces of metals in the ink used etc. There will inevitably be more and more successful attacks on physical representations of bitcoin that hide the private key inside some physical medium.""  Marchenko went on to outline general concerns with physical representations of digital currencies: ""What is even more worrying with such types of 'physical bitcoins' is the unknown 'chain of custody' of a private key before it gets embedded in the coin. We might as well all assume that the manufacturer of the coin is an upstanding gentleman with no intent to keep a database of private keys, but there are no guarantees. The first rule of information security is to not take unknown risks. These coins definitely have lots of novelty value and might be an interesting artefact and have some numismatic value. However, I would strongly advise against using such physical coins as a long term storage medium of any non-trivial amount of bitcoins.""  Marchenko made the case to us that bitcoin should not be made into physical representations as doing so removes many of the benefits of a digital currency. ""Bitcoin is designed as an electronic currency and the safest way to use it is to use it electronically and keep bitcoin transactions on the block chain. Private keys are meant to remain private and never be revealed to any third parties. The moment one starts trading private keys, one is voluntarily forfeiting most of the benefits modern cryptography like bitcoin provides. Those Defcon hackers have clearly demonstrated this concept by picking easy targets, like removing a sticker from a piece of plastic. I would be much more impressed if they had successfully attacked SHA256, RIPEMD or ECDSA.""
