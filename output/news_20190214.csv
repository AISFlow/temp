42430195,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMp2nh,1550184306,"'Already Live': Signature Bank Is Moving Millions on a JPMorgan-Like Private, Dollar-Backed Cryptocurrency","While crypto-land is abuzz about JPMorgan’s plan to move U.S. dollars around via blockchain, a smaller New York bank has already been doing this for nearly two months.  Since launching at the start of the year, Signature Bank’s blockchain-based Signet system has on-boarded more than 100 clients who are using it to send each other millions of dollars a day, 24/7, bank executives said.  Joseph J. DePaolo, president and CEO at Signature Bank, told CoinDesk:  ""We can say there are trades going on in the millions some days and tens of millions other days and I would say the number of clients we have is in the triple digits.""  Signature is one of the few banks in the U.S. that will provide deposit accounts to cryptocurrency startups, a group that also includes fellow New Yorkers at Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in San Diego.  But while these clients were the first group to adopt Signet, the bank says non-crypto businesses are signing up as well.  In addition to the previously announced American PowerNet, an independent electrical power trading firm that made Signet the payments platform for its renewable energy customers, DePaolo said Signature is bringing on two other “ecosystems” where rapid movement of money and property is important.  ""We will shortly onboard a substantial cargo ecosystem and wholesale diamonds,"" he said, declining to name either organization.  He also said Signature is in talks with a title insurance company. Explaining why such an entity would be interested in real-time payments, he said:  ""If you've ever been involved in a commercial real estate closing, usually all the lawyers are sitting around eating lunch waiting for the wire transfer.""  Signet vs. JPM Coin  With $45 billion in assets, Signature Bank is less than 2% the size of JPMorgan, the largest bank in the U.S. So it’s perhaps understandable that DePaolo and Signature chairman Scott Shay clearly took some pride in pointing out that JPM Coin, announced Thursday, is remarkably similar to what they already have.  A rather subtle similarity between Signature's blockchain system and JPM Coin is that both run on private variants of ethereum technology.  In the case of JPM this is Quorum, a data privacy-oriented fork of the ethereum public blockchain code. The Signet platform, built in conjunction with trueDigital, is a proprietary blockchain which also uses ethereum as its base.  Another commonality is that both involve stablecoins, with real-world dollars deposited at the bank in exchange for tokens that clients can send each other via a distributed ledger, then redeem again 1-to-1 with the institution.  The goal of replacing wire transfers with a blockchain is also reminiscent of crypto-friendly rival Silvergate Bank's SEN system that instantly connects to its clients 24/7.  But Signature chairman Scott Shay claimed the broad uses of Signet sets it apart.  ""If you happen to be an exchange [SEN] is useful, but we developed Signet to be tailored to a wide variety of industries. It's not crypto exchange-focused,"" he said.  Returning to JPM Coin, Shay pointed out that Signet has already received approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). By contrast, JPMorgan said in its announcement that as it gets ready to launch the new product, “we will actively engage our regulators to explain its design and solicit their feedback and any necessary approvals.”  Shay concluded:  ""The difference is we are actually out there doing this.""

U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel placed the injunction against Blockvest and its founder, Reginald Buddy Ringgold III (otherwise known as Rasool Abdul Rahim El), Thursday citing the risk of future securities law violations based on ""newly developed evidence,"" as well as evidence of past violations.  In his ruling, Curiel explained that after additional briefings and reviewing the evidence, Blockvest likely may have violated securities laws, placing a preliminary injunction on the startup and Ringgold (otherwise known as Rasool Abdul Rahim El), to prevent them from further violations. Ringgold did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Curiel wrote that ""the Court finds reconsideration is warranted based upon a prima facie showing of Defendants’ past securities violation and newly developed evidence which supports the conclusion that there is a reasonable likelihood of future violations.""  He later explained that this new evidence includes the fact that Ringgold's defense counsel moved to withdraw from representing him and his firm in the case because the defendants instructed the firm to ""file certain documents that counsel could not certify"" under federal rules.  Curiel added:  ""In fact, when defense counsel declined to file the documents, Defendants attempted to file such documents with the Court without counsel's permission or signature and the documents were rejected by the Court Clerk.""  The law firm, Corrigan & Morris LLP, went into further detail in its motion to withdraw, filed Dec. 27, 2018. According to the document, Ringgold failed to pay the firm for its work and has ""levied serious accusations"" against the lawyers working on his case.  ""Between November 27, 2018 and the date of this filing, there has been a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship,"" the firm said.  The motion was granted.  Curiel previously denied the SEC an injunction after the case was first heard in November 2018. At the time, the regulator alleged that 32 individuals effectively bought Blockvest's BLV tokens in an unregistered securities sale, a claim the company denied at the time. The SEC first filed suit in October of last year.  While Curiel did not make a decision on whether the BLV tokens were indeed securities, he did rule at the time that there was insufficient evidence to prove that a securities sale took place.

42430188,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMp2Xh,1550179804,Coinbase Exchange Users Can Now Withdraw Bitcoin Cash Fork BSV,"Coinbase, the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange, is finally allowing users to withdraw bitcoin Satoshi vision (BSV) – the cryptocurrency created in a hard fork of the bitcoin cash blockchain on Nov. 15.  On that day, bitcoin cash was scheduled to implement upgrades to its blockchain, as it is programmed to do every six months, but contention ultimately led developers and miners to adopt two different incompatible versions of the software: bitcoin cash ABC (BCH) and BSV, which now operate as separate cryptocurrencies with separate values.  Coinbase users who held bitcoin cash in their accounts at the time of the fork were given BSV coins at a 1:1 ratio, and the exchange notified its users today, three months after the fork, that their BSV balances could now be accessed.  Since Coinbase does not support BSV trading at this time, users will need to export their BSV balance to an external wallet if they wish to trade it for another cryptocurrency or for fiat.  In the email, the exchange made note of the circumstances and provided instructions on how to do so:  “Coinbase does not support purchases or sales of BSV, so you cannot sell your BSV for fiat currency on Coinbase. You may send your BSV balance to an external wallet following instructions here.”  On Nov. 20, Coinbase announced the competing bitcoin cash blockchain called bitcoin cash ABC would retain the BCH ticker and compatibility with Coinbase’s trading infrastructure.  At the time of writing, BSV is trading across exchanges at an average price of $62.58 while its competitor BCH costs nearly twice the price at $120.23, according to pricing data from CoinDesk.

42422922,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qzVh,1550175617,Judge Delays Decision On Legal Representation for Quadriga Creditors,"A Canadian judge declined to name any law firms to represent as many as 115,000 users of QuadrigaCX, deferring that significant decision by a week.  Nova Scotia Supreme Court Judge Michael Wood said during a hearing Thursday that he would not appoint any firms as representative counsel or make any other decisions regarding creditor representation immediately, though he plans to have a final decision within the week.  Wood did, however, shoot down a proposal which would have delayed the process even further.  As CoinDesk previously reported, three legal teams have formally applied for the position of representative counsel: Bennett Jones with McInnes Cooper, Miller Thomson with Cox and Palmer and Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt with Patterson Law. Another law firm, Goodmans LLP, wrote a letter calling for an extended appointment process, saying a committee of creditors who can coordinate should be created beforehand.  Whichever law firm team is appointed would be tasked with coordinating between Quadriga as it seeks to recoup roughly $196 million it owes its creditors and those whose balances are stuck on the exchange specifically.  The representative counsel may also begin preparatory work for a class action lawsuit, though such a suit cannot be filed during a court-imposed stay of proceedings. That stay is set to expire March 7 barring any further action on that front.  Money troubles  The question of who will represent Quadriga's customers aside, Thursday's hearing also touched on the funding issues surrounding the recovery efforts.  Professional services firm EY, a court-appointed monitor for Quadriga, explained in court Thursday that its oversight (along with lawyers' fees) was being funded through a $300,000 lump sum dedicated to the process. Of this, $250,000 has already been spent, and the firm estimated that its runway would last for no more than two weeks.  EY has not yet received any funds from the payment processors holding Quadriga's fiat balances, it said in a report published earlier this week. The companies are working with some of these processors to have the exchange's funds released, though at least one is claiming it ""has the right to continue to hold funds.""  The firm was not named, though in previous court filings, Quadriga identified WB21 as a payment processor which refused to release funds to the exchange. WB21 did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The report also touched on the issues involved with pulling funds out of processors thta are cooperating with the monitor, noting that one unnamed firm was holding roughly $25.2 million CAD ($19 million USD) for the exchange.  Billerfy, a payment processor for Quadriga, previously told CoinDesk it was holding that amount in the form of bank drafts while it sought a banking partner who would endorse – and therefore, cash out – the funds.  José Reyes, Billerfy's managing director, said at the time that the company was having difficulty finding a bank willing to work with crypto-related funds, causing delays.  Tuesday's report added:  ""Counsel for the Applicants and the Monitor have been in contact with legal counsel for this payment processor. There are various issues to address, however, discussions between the parties have been positive to date.""  A separate group of bank drafts held by another unnamed third-party processor has been transferred to Stewart McKelvey, the law firm representing Quadriga, according to EY's report. These drafts are currently being cataloged.  The report did not specify what the total value of these drafts was, though in its initial filing, Quadriga identified some $565,000 being held by a total of three processors.  A hearing will be held on Feb. 22 to help facilitate the transfer of these funds to EY.  Attorneys for EY and Quadriga apparently did not discuss how efforts to recover $136 million in cryptocurrencies currently locked in cold wallets are proceeding.

""Given that this technology is what has been used to create and run the cryptocurrency markets, you may be concerned that these are investments in bitcoin or other electronic currencies,"" the retirement systems' executive director, Jeff Weiler, wrote in an FAQ on the county's website before going on to explain this was not the case.  As previously reported, the two pension funds are anchor investors in the $40 million venture fund announced this week by Morgan Creek, in what appeared to be the first such bets on the sector placed by institutions of this kind.  In his FAQ, Weiler revealed the exact breakdown of Fairfax's commitments: $10 million from the county employees' pension fund, and $11 million from the police officers' fund.  To put those figures in perspective, however, they represent just 0.3 percent of the employee fund's assets and 0.8 percent of the police officer fund's, he noted, adding:  ""These investments were deliberately sized to be a small portion of each system’s assets, given that the blockchain technology industry is still in its early stages.""  Moreover, the vast majority – at least 85 percent – of the Morgan Creek Blockchain Opportunities Fund will be invested in blockchain technology firms, Weiler wrote, noting: ""As such, this is very similar to other private equity investments made by Fairfax’s three retirement systems.""  No more than 15 percent of the fund will be put into cryptocurrency, and so far none of it has been, he added.  Due diligence  Weiler went on to describe the pension funds' due diligence on the investment, noting that staff and board members of both funds traveled to Chapel Hill, N.C., where Morgan Creek is based, to meet with the team there. Further, Morgan Creek made presentations to both funds' boards at their monthly meetings, where the proposed investments were discussed at length.  ""County attorneys and outside investment counsel spent a lot of time and energy ironing out the details of the investment contracts, to ensure that Fairfax County’s interests were assured,"" Weiler added.  His note also included an overview of blockchain technology that emphasized that its potential applications go beyond cryptocurrency and include things such as identity verification and voting.  Weiler concluded his note with a timeless reminder that all investments carry some risk, but assured the public that the pension funds had limited their downside, saying:  ""Fairfax’s investment team determined that the expected returns from this investment were in line with the level of risk incurred. This also played a big part in how much was invested.""

42430193,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMp2jh,1550163613,Blockchain Startups Are Modernizing Iran's Financial Infrastructure,"Update (Feb. 15, 20:30 UTC): This article and its headline have been updated to clarify the status of two of the projects discussed: Borna is the only project to receive government funding, and it does not currently plan to issue tokens; Kuknos does not yet have government approval for Paymon because the new legal process is still being finalized.    ---------    The Iranian government is engaging with blockchain startups that are laying what could be the groundwork for a new token ecosystem, CoinDesk has learned.  Many government banks around the world have launched isolated blockchain pilots. But in January, the Central Bank of Iran unveiled plans for a more comprehensive cryptocurrency program at Tehran's Electronic Banking and Payments conference. While the new framework – which includes restrictions on accepting or sending bitcoin payments as well as supportive measures for bank-issued cryptocurrencies – is not yet approved, Iranian sources say it's in the process of becoming law.  Sources tell CoinDesk at least one such project earned the support of the central bank's technology arm, the Informatics Services Corporation (ISC). What's more, private banks in the country have stepped up to fund one of the startups in a move that could pave the way for the issuance of the first native Iranian cryptocurrency.  One of those initiatives is the Kuknos protocol, created by a new Tehran-based startup called Kuknos Company, which is seeking permission to issue a gold-backed token called Paymon. Another blockchain infrastructure project called Borna is being developed in a private-public partnership and is funded directly by the Central Bank of Iran.  One anonymous source working within the ISC told CoinDesk that startups are helping to modernize Iran's financial infrastructure.  The first startup, Kuknos Company, was recently founded with just under 20 employees, according to Kuknos advisor Soheil Nikzad. The company is receiving funding from private Iranian banks like Bank Mellat, Bank Melli Iran, Bank Pasargad and Parsian Bank.  Nikzad told CoinDesk the company will release Paymon, the gold-backed cryptocurrency, in a multi-stage token sale, including a private sale to banks and eventually a public securities offering akin to stocks. The Kuknos protocol will also include a system for tokenizing traditional assets like real estate, he said.  Speaking about the public phase of the upcoming Paymon token sale, Nikzad said:  “The third phase is for everybody and will depend on the regulation of the security market in Iran. Right now we are negotiating with [regulators].”  At the same time Borna – the second blockchain project presented at the same conference in Tehran in January – is being developed by the startup Areatak in conjunction with the ISC.  Areatak is a bitcoin industry incumbent that previously garnered most of its funding through the local cryptocurrency mining boom. Part of this startup is now housed inside ISC’s Tehran office, where it is developing a national system for identity verification and token management, according to the anonymous source within the organization.  Nikzad said several local projects have reached out to Kuknos seeking guidance for prospective initial coin offerings.  “There are at least 50 blockchain startups in Iran,” Nikzad said. Speaking of the broader Iranian market he added:  “They are doing their best and waiting for their destiny, to connect to the other bankers abroad.”  Token economy  “The most important advantages of Borna is the know-your-customer process and compatibility with the revised Payment Service Directive implementation,” Iranian entrepreneur Amir Abbas Emami told CoinDesk.  “Kuknos is another banking consortium blockchain using Stellar architecture for tokenization of assets such as gold, real estate, fiat currencies and other assets,” Emami said.  If the Securities and Exchange Organization of Iran approves regulations for non-governmental entities to issue tokens, Emami’s crypto startup CarChain aims to use these systems for an initial coin offering in 2019. CarChain is very similar to the ride-sharing app Uber except it accepts token payments and would leverage distributed networks for enhanced privacy features.  Speaking of the new banking plans, Emami said:  “It could help us. [The government] knows the benefits of the blockchain are not confined to [circumnavigating] sanctions.”  Until then, Areatak CTO Alireza Arabi told CoinDesk that Borna is the only blockchain project officially approved by the central bank and, indeed, owned by the ISC.  ""It [Borna] provides the main standard infrastructure to create a blockchain-based financial layer for Iran’s banking ecosystem,"" Arabi said.  On sanctions  Global media sources have speculated about Iran seeking to leverage cryptocurrencies to bypass economic sanctions, which restrict U.S. banks and organizations from doing business with the Iranian finance sector.  The anonymous Iranian source with knowledge of ISC's work said bypassing sanctions would be “too suspicious” for the governmental bank. Borna, ISC’s Hyperledger-based project, is focused on modernizing and standardizing digital infrastructure across domestic business sectors like insurance and healthcare.  Plus, any individuals involved with a project deliberately designed to evade sanctions would likely find themselves personally subject to sanctions if they traveled abroad.  Likewise, Nikzad said that even though the private sector’s Kuknos system will be more compatible with international finance systems, its main goal is to reduce costs and friction for domestic Iranian transactions.  “By implementing new standards, based on international standards, you are able to make systems that are ready to connect to international ones,” Nikzad said. “Even if they don’t connect abroad, at least they’ve improved Iranian payment systems and decreased costs.”  For now, Nikzad said Kuknos is focused on establishing strategic pilots with local mobile operators, insurance companies and other enterprise banking customers.  Much like the broader cryptocurrency space, the aim is to make significant portions of the Kuknos ecosystem from open source software and to also release additions on platforms like GitHub, so that any developer around the world could contribute to or integrate these Iranian systems.  Despite the government’s stringent approach to bitcoin, the anonymous Iranian source said he was neither disappointed nor surprised.  “I personally wouldn’t expect anything else from Iran’s central bank other than they acknowledge the technology that is changing the world,” he said, noting the government’s “conservative” approach to decentralized currencies.

Officially announced by Baidu Cloud on Thursday, the Baidu Blockchain Engine (BBE) platform is touted as a kind of operating system allowing developers to produce blockchain applications ""just like mobile apps,"" and get around the storage and computing ""bottlenecks"" that are holding up blockchain's potential.  BBE is built on what the company calls the ABC (AI, Big Data, cloud computing) technology stack, allowing customers to explore and develop ways to commercialize blockchain tech.  Hosted on Baidu's ""intelligent"" cloud platform, the system uses a modular blockchain framework to provide developers with a multi-chain system including smart contract templates, dapp templates and other services aimed to make development simple and fast.  The platform also supports deployment in the customer's existing enterprise frameworks, and can be set up as a""highly available and flexible"" blockchain blockchain-as-a-service platform. It offers support for various blockchain scenarios including consortium and private chains, the post says.  On the technical side, BBE offers six primary features, the post says, from a trusted computing environment, high performance and high throughput and scalable storage, to cross-chain interactions, ""intelligent"" smart contracts and smart contract security auditing. It's also designed to provide security of data and privacy protection.  For consumer-focused finance, BBE supports features such as credit, metering and transactions. The system can also support the verification of 50 billion tokenized assets, Baidu claims.  The company has already been active on the blockchain front, releasing a white paper for its Xuperchain blockchain network last September. It's also launched a photo app and a space-focused game on the blockchain, and now stores revisions to its Chinese Wikipedia-like encyclopedia site on a blockchain too.

42430201,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMp2zh,1550155305,State of Blockchains: Bitcoin (BTC) Fees,"Transaction fees make the bitcoin blockchain go round. The miners are compensated for their efforts, not only through inflationary block rewards but also through fees charged to users for adding their transaction to blocks. While fees on average make up about 4% of the total miner revenue per day, with the lion’s share coming from block rewards, sometimes economic shocks cause those fees to rise.  The average fee per transaction is approximately $1.63 with the median being $0.88 over the past five years. The fees are the prices charged for a transaction to get into the limited space of a 1 MB block that occurs every 10 minutes. This results in about 1,800 transactions (~556 average transaction size in bytes) that are able to fit into a block. If the standard 144 blocks are mined per day, we observe a ceiling of about 260,000 transactions per day. Thus there is always a backlog of unconfirmed transactions that reside in the mempool awaiting miners to select them for inclusion in the blockchain.  According to Blockchain.Info, there are about 3.4 million bytes awaiting inclusion in the mempool. Miners will usually include the transaction with the highest fees and work their way down as capacity dwindles to the lower fee transactions. Imagine you are commuting to work and you hit a traffic jam. There is a premium toll road that allows limos to pass by the normal commuters in the low fee road. Eventually, your car gets through and you arrive at work only 5 hours late. This is how transactions get into the blockchain, although the capacity should never increase so much that an exasperated traffic jam occurs…or at least not a big one.  Such a traffic jam occurred in Q4 of 2017. Bitcoin interest was at an all-time high which led to a parallel increase in price to nearly $20,000. All this demand caused the mempool to become clogged which caused transaction fees to rise to about $30-$60 and confirmation times to expand to a week. Some suggested that this made bitcoin unusable in commerce while others described this as the natural fate of sound digital money. The traffic jam was only solved as demand evaporated from the market and price began to fall.  Bitcoin now sits sub-$4k and the demand is returning to parity with that of Q4’17. Astonishingly, fees have remained low. This begs the question of how we could have the same increased demand levels but not the commensurate increase in fees. The answer is Segwit Adoption.  Segwit is a software upgrade that allows transaction data to be minimized so a user can fit more transactions in a given block. Only 10% of transactions were using Segwit during the fee crisis of Q4’17 while more than 35% are now using it. Jimmy Song, blockchain programmer, simplifies it as “Segwit transactions [result] in a block size of around 2MB”. Thus fees and confirmation times were reduced through the solution of an effective block size increase.  While a new crisis has been averted it seems that it really has only been pushed down the road. As demand grows, bitcoiners are rushing to both increase Segwit adoption to 100% as well as offload as much of that demand to L2 solutions. Bitcoin transactions that are fast and cheap might end up being a nostalgic memory as mass adoption takes hold, but we can rest easy…for now.

Last month, the bank announced it had settled more than $250 billion in transactions using its HSBC FX Everywhere platform.  It said then that it had settled 3 million foreign exchange transactions and made a further 150,000 payments over the digital ledger system, which it has been using over the last year “to orchestrate payments across HSBC’s internal balance sheets.”  In the Reuters report, Williamson said that HSBC processes from 3,500 to 5,000 trades a day on FX Everywhere, with trades now being worth $350 billion.  “We’re able to demonstrate that this is not a one-off proof of concept or just one or two trades,” Williamson said.  Reuters further quoted him as saying that a ""significant"" amount of internal money flows are likely to be settled on the DLT system.  HSBC has been experimenting wit blockchain for some time. Since joining blockchain consortium startup R3 in 2015, it has teamed up with Bank of America and the Singapore government on a blockchain supply chain trial  It's also joined work on the Utility Settlement Coin (USC) project, designed to make it easier for global banks to conduct a variety of transactions with each other using collateralized assets on a custom-built blockchain.

42381551,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nEAR,1550149249,Latest XRP Ledger Release Boosts Censorship Resistance and More,"Blockchain payments infrastructure firm Ripple has announced the latest release of XRP Ledger.  ""Stewarded"" by Ripple, the open-source protocol is maintained by a network of peer-to-peer servers with XRP as its native ""bridge"" token.  According to a release issued by Ripple on Thursday, version 1.2.0 of the ledger introduces a number of changes, including making the network more resistant to censorship – that is, no single entity can decide which transactions succeed or fail, and no one can alter a transaction after it is added to the ledger.  Ripple says in the release:  ""Already highly resistant to censorship attempts, with the release of version 1.2.0 of the XRP Ledger, servers now have the ability to automatically detect transaction censorship attempts and issue warnings of increasing severity for transactions that a server believes should have been included in a closed ledger after several rounds of consensus.""  Version 1.2.0 also lowers the threshold for network participants involved in signing transactions. The MultiSignReserve amendment allows owners of signer lists for authorization method Multisign to participate with a reserve of just 5 XRP, down from the previous 15–50 XRP.  The release also lists a host of smaller updates and amendments, along with minor bug fixes. Ripple said it welcomes reviews of the updated codebase and is offering rewards for disclosure of vulnerabilities under its bug bounty program.  Operators of XRP Ledger servers should upgrade to version 1.2.0 by Feb. 27, ""to ensure service continuity,"" the firm said. Participants that do not upgrade will be blocked from helping update the ledger and may receive invalid data.  Ripple itself started rolling out the upgrade across all its XRP Ledger servers, including private clusters, from 22:00 UTC on Wednesday, Feb. 13.  The firm's relationship with XRP has proved a tricky one at times. Ripple has sought to distance itself from being seen as the issuer of the token, which it has said is not a cryptocurrency but a digital asset, over the potential for the token to be deemed a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  “While the coin doesn’t represent an ownership stake in Ripple, the concern is the close relationship might still lead regulators to deem XRP a security,” a Bloomberg report from April 2018 said.  Investors have since moved to sue the firm over the issue, and a class action suit merging all the claims moved to the federal court last November.  Despite the issues, Ripple has been successful in garnering new members for its RippleNet products suite, now having over 200 members. And last month, the first bank, U.K.-based Exim, said it was using XRP for cross-border payments  Currently the third cryptocurrency by market capitalization, XRP is currently trading at around $0.30, according to data from CoinMarketCap – that's a 92 percent drop from its all-time high of $3.80 in January 2018.

42381553,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nECx,1550145635,JPMorgan Has Its Own Crypto and It's Starting Real-World Trials,"While its CEO, Jamie Dimon, is notorious for his critical comments on bitcoin, investment bank JPMorgan is preparing for a future where blockchain is a key part of financial infrastructure with its own cryptocurrency.  Called JPM Coin, the token has been developed by engineers at the bank, according to a report from CNBC on Thursday, and is moving to real-world trials in ""a few months""  For the effort, JPM Coin will be used to settle a small portion of its transactions between clients of its wholesale payments business in real time, CNBC says. The bank moves over $6 trillion daily as part of that business, it adds.  Speaking to the news source, Umar Farooq, JPMorgan's blockchain lead, posited three main use cases for the bank token, including replacing wire transfers for international payments by large corporate clients and cutting settlement times from days to just moments.  It could also be used to provide instant settlement for securities issuance, as well as to replace U.S. dollars held internationally by subsidiaries of major corporations using JPMorgan's treasury services.  ""Money sloshes back and forth all over the world in a large enterprise,"" Farooq said. ""Is there a way to ensure that a subsidiary can represent cash on the balance sheet without having to actually wire it to the unit? That way, they can consolidate their money and probably get better rates for it.""  Eventually, JPM Coin could be used for mobile payments, he added.  ""Pretty much every big corporation is our client, and most of the major banks in the world are, too,"" Farooq concluded. So, even just using the token among JPMorgan clients ""shouldn't hold us back.""  Not just Quorum  According to an FAQ released by JPMorgan later Thursday, JPM Coin will initially run on top of Quorum, the private version of ethereum the bank developed in conjunction with EthLab – but not exclusively.  ""The JPM Coin will be issued on Quorum Blockchain and subsequently extended to other platforms. JPM Coin will be operable on all standard Blockchain networks,"" the FAQ says.  Further, JPM Coin won't just be used to represent greenbacks.  ""Over time, JPM Coin will be extended to other major currencies. The product and technology capabilities are currency agnostic,"" according to the FAQ.  Reading between the lines, the document suggests that JPMorgan is open to offering a cash-on-ledger service to other permissioned enterprise blockchains.  For example, it contrasts JPM Coin not only with open-access cryptocurrencies but with other stablecoins, such as the USDC coin created by Circle, where ""only exchange customers can mint (buy with US$) or redeem (sell for US$) stablecoins but anyone can own or trade them.""  JPM Coin , on the other hand, is ""permissioned (i.e., enterprise grade secure blockchain solutions built by J.P. Morgan and/or partners),"" the FAQ says (emphasis added here).  To drive home the point about limited access, it adds: ""Only institutional customers passing J.P. Morgan KYC can transact with these coins.""  Nevertheless, JPM Coin will function similarly to other stablecoins, in the sense that real-world cash will be deposited at the bank in exchange for the token, which can then be transferred via a distributed ledger (although, to be clear, only a permissioned one). The recipient can then redeem the token for cash from JPMorgan.  Other projects  The bank is also running a blockchain payments trial launched in conjunction with Australia’s ANZ and the Royal Bank of Canada. As reported, the three banks set up the project in October 2017, aiming to slash both the time and costs required for interbank payments using traditional methods.  Called the Interbank Information Network (IIN), the platform is also built on Quorum – which itself may eventually be spun off into its own enterprise.  The bank's FAQ released Thursday goes out of its way to say that IIN will be unaffected by JPM Coin.  ""IIN transfers information, not payments, between correspondent banks. The JPM Coin, representing fiat currency, is designed to instantaneously transfer value,"" the document says.  Last April, JPMorgan also partnered with National Bank of Canada and other major firms to trial Quorum with a debt issuance worth $150 million.  The trial mirrored a $150 million offering the same day by the National Bank of Canada of a one-year floating-rate Yankee certificate of deposit.  While working on its own token, JPMorgan recently said that cryptocurrencies would only have value in a dystopian economy.  CEO Jamie Dimon notably also declared bitcoin a “fraud” in 2017, adding, “It’s worse than tulip bulbs. It won’t end well. Someone is going to get killed.”  UPDATE (14, February 14:30 UTC): This article has been updated with additional information released by JPMorgan.

42381555,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nEFT,1550142004,Long-Term Indicator Suggests Bitcoin Price May Be Nearing Bottom,"View  Bitcoin's weekly MACD has diverged in favor of the bulls. The indicator carved out a higher low in December, even though bitcoin's price slipped to $3,100, signaling waning bearish pressures 17 months before the mining reward halving. Bitcoin witnessed a similar MACD divergence 17 months before the previous halving in July 2016.  The bullish MACD divergence indicates the cryptocurrency could be nearing a long-term bottom or may have carved out one near $3,100 in December. That said, a move above the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,334, is needed to confirm a long-term bullish reversal.  Bitcoin could rise above $4,000 if the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline, currently at $3,735, is breached. A downside break of the wedge pattern seen in the 4-hour chart could yield a re-test of $3,400.  A long-term price indicator validates a growing consensus among investors that bitcoin (BTC) is close to bottoming out.  BTC fell below $6,000 on Nov. 14, dashing hopes of a long-term bullish reversal from that long-held psychological support.  The subsequent sell-off came to a halt near $3,100 in December – 18 months ahead of the mining reward halving – triggering speculation that the cryptocurrency could bottom out in 2019. It is worth noting that BTC created a long-term bottom in January 2015 before undergoing a reward halving in July 2016.  While investors are betting that history will repeat itself, bitcoin's corrective rally from December lows is struggling to pick up the pace.  That, however, could change in the near future, as the bitcoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) – a momentum indicator based upon price moving averages – is signaling waning bearish pressures.  The MACD usually moves in the direction of the price trend and indicates the strength of a move.  Bitcoin's weekly MACD, however, has diverged from the primary bearish trend, i.e. the price hit a lower low near $3,100 in December, while the MACD carved out a higher low. A bullish divergence is widely considered a sign of seller exhaustion and is often followed by trend reversal.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,570 on Bitstamp, having hit highs above $3,700 last week.  Weekly chart        On the weekly chart, the MACD has produced a higher low in favor of the bulls. It is worth noting that a similar bullish divergence was charted over the five months leading up to January 2015, when BTC bottomed out near $150.  So, there is a reason to believe the cryptocurrency is nearing, or has already reached, a major bottom.  As a result, the probability of BTC witnessing a bullish reversal in the next few months is high. A convincing move above the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) – a level which acted as strong support last year – would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. As of writing, that average is located at $5,334.  Meanwhile, the prospects of a short-term rally to $4,000 would improve if BTC clears the resistance at $3,735.  4-hour chart  BTC has carved out a falling wedge pattern – a bullish continuation pattern – on the 4-hour chart. A move above $3,585 would confirm a wedge breakout and could yield a rally to $3,735, which is the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern. A violation there would open up upside toward $4,100 (target as per the measured move method).

42381560,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nEJF,1550138409,Ethereum's Blockchain Is Once Again Feeling the 'Difficulty Bomb' Effect,"Ethereum is being affected by what is popularly known as the ""difficulty bomb"" embedded in the code – and this month's upcoming hard fork is expected to once again push its effects further into the future.  The piece of code was originally created in an effort to create an incentive – a negative one at that – for miners and developers to manage the transition from proof-of-work consensus to proof-of-stake. In effect, the difficulty bomb as referenced back in 2015 by former ethereum CCO Stephan Tual raises the difficulty level of mining a block on the ethereum blockchain exponentially over time.  The bomb began to ""go off"" so to speak last December after being delayed once in June 2017 and again in October 2017. The initial impacts of the code – though minor to start off with – are slowly but surely starting to become noticeable on the network, as the data shows.  As reported by blockchain analytics site Etherscan, the ethereum blockchain saw its lowest level of daily block reward issuance Monday with a recorded 13,131 ETH. By comparison, as late as mid-November, new issuance was regularly seen above 20,000 ETH.  What’s more, Etherscan reports a clear decline since December in the number of blocks produced on ethereum per day, which sits at present below 4,500 blocks.  Afri Schoedon – release manager for ethereum client Parity – estimates if left unaddressed, it would take two to three months from now for the difficulty bomb to stall the ethereum blockchain to new record-lows.  Yet before that happens, the bomb is actually expected to be delayed again for a period of 12 months as part of a system-wide upgrade known as Constantinople.  Constantinople – which is scheduled to launch later this month at block number 7,280,000 – will, among other changes to the network, stabilize average block count to 5,700 blocks daily and reduce block time creation to roughly 15 seconds, according to Schoedon.  And this not being the first time ethereum core developers have had to include such tweaks to the difficulty bomb code. Schoedon expressed exasperation at the need to deal with the reoccurring effects of the bomb at all.  “The bomb is an annoyance that no longer serves a purpose,” Schoedon told CoinDesk.  Time’s up  Schoedan elaborated on that point by highlighting that the transition to PoS – also commonly dubbed ethereum 2.0 or Serenity – likely won’t occur within this year or next.  He went on to say:  “I personally don’t want to deal with [the difficulty bomb] anymore. Serenity is not happening this year and most likely not next year. So why bother?”  To this point, Eric Conner – founder of ,ethereum information site ETHHub – agreed telling CoinDesk that, in his view, the motivationary effect of the difficulty bomb isn't the same as it was.  “Early on it was true but I think now that the entire community and developer set is clearly focused on ethereum 2.0 – and therefore PoS,” said Conner to CoinDesk. “At this point it’s more a motivator to always revisit upgrades and be forced to do something.”  Some developers, on the other hand, continue to see the difficulty bomb as playing an important role in the network's evolution.  In a response to an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) by Schoedon that would delay the bomb indefinitely, Marcus Ligi – creator of ethereum android wallet Walleth – wrote:  “My fear is that without the difficulty bomb we might end up in a situation where rolling out [system-wide upgrades] gets difficult because people just do not update their software as there is no real need to do so.”  Blast to the past  As with the previous delay to the difficulty bomb included in system-wide upgrade Byzantium, users faced record low block counts in the fall of 2017.  Mining difficulty levels increase by a factor of two as a result of the bomb every 100,000 blocks, Conner noted. As a result of this, he also highlighted that during the months shortly preceding Byzantium in October 2017 average block times on the ethereum network reached record highs of up to 30 seconds.  This time around, Conner doesn’t imagine any further impacts of the difficulty bomb on the ethereum network, given that Constantinople – with its kicking-of-the-can built-in – will occur before the next expected uptick in mining difficulty at block 7,300,000.  What's more, after Constantinople is activated, ethereum will face an added reduction of block reward issuance from 3 to 2 ETH. The reduction ""thirdening"" was put in place in order to mitigate the impacts of inflation on the network without a timed difficulty bomb.  The following graph on ETHHub illustrates a continued downward trend for ETH issuance in the years ahead.  Of course, the projected trend for issuance illustrated above in orange is highly dependent on both activation of Constantinople and Serenity over the next two to three years. A testnet launch for the initial phases of Serenity is expected sometime in March.  Nevertheless, as with most things in cryptocurrency development, only time will have the final word.

42381549,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nE5P,1550134837,Coinbase Just Paid a $30K Bounty for the Discovery of Critical Bug,"San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange desk Coinbase has just forked out a $30,000 bounty to the finder of a critical bug in its systems.  As reported by The Next Web, the bounty is the latest to be posted on vulnerability coordination and bug bounty platform HackerOne. Previously a large number of smaller bounties, mostly in the range of $100–$1,000, have been paid out, but on Feb. 12 what appears to be the largest bounty on the site so far was logged.  TNW's Hard Fork said Coinbase had confirmed that the vulnerability has since been fixed, but would not provide specific details of the issue.  Based on the severity of the code flaw found, Coinbase offers rewards in four tiers: $200 (low), $2,000 (medium), $15,000 (high) and $50,000 (critical). Tuesday's bounty appears to sit somewhere between high and critical as a result.  Coinbase states on the HackerOne website:  ""The Bug Bounty Program directly serves Coinbase's mission by helping us be the most trusted way to use digital currency. In that spirit, the scope and philosophy of the program aim to safeguard two highest priority assets (“Sensitive Data”): Digital and fiat currency balances [and] customer information.""  The program allows the public to report for rewards on ""all software vulnerabilities in services provided by Coinbase,"" it adds. The exchange grants bounties based on severity of the bug found, judging severity by two factors: impact and exploitability.  With crypto companies and protocols under constant attack from increasingly sophisticated hackers, finding bugs in systems is a critical endeavor.  Ethereum bug bounty websites like Gitcoin and Bounties Network have seen increased use of late, and the growing opportunity for rewards via white hack hacking success is even proving to be a way out of poverty, according to a CoinDesk report from last year.  No web service using crypto is immune from the threat of hacks and even dark markets have been offering bounties to those that find provable code errors with potential impact.

42381538,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nDvL,1550120412,The Race to Represent QuadrigaCX's Creditors May Be Decided Today,"Law firms jockeying to represent somewhere between 90,000 and 115,000 users of QuadrigaCX will appear before the Nova Scotia Supreme Court Thursday to see which firms will be appointed representative counsel.  The Canadian crypto exchange filed for, and was granted, a stay of proceedings under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) earlier this month. As a result, Quadriga has until March 7 to try and recoup as much as $260 million CAD ($196 million USD) that it says it owes to customers. While some of these funds are held in cash by payment processors, the vast majority is reportedly locked away as cryptocurrencies in offline cold wallets.  Ernst and Young (EY) has already been appointed as a monitor for the exchange, meaning it is working with Quadriga to recover its funds and determine what other assets can be sold to generate some revenue.  Multiple law firms have filed notices to represent the interests of the exchange's users as well. Whichever firms are appointed is likely to build up a potential class action lawsuit, which would be filed after the stay of proceedings is lifted. The law firms would also be tasked with reaching out to creditors and compiling a list of affected users, potentially as part of this lawsuit.  So far, three different teams have filed notices of motion: Bennett Jones and McInnes Cooper, Miller Thomson with Cox and Palmer and Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt with Patterson Law, according to a webpage set up by EY. Each of these teams cites affidavits from creditors explaining why they should be appointed as representative counsel.  Judge Michael Wood may decide as soon as Thursday which of these teams gets the nod.  A rare competition  According to EY's first report, published earlier this week, it is rare for multiple law firms to bid to become representative counsel in a creditor case.  In providing its recommendations to the court, the firm explained:  ""In those cases, the Courts considered the underlying experience of the proposed counsel, as well as considering which law firm proposed to represent the most inclusive class of claimants and how many claimants have already retained that firm to represent them.""  According to the filings, each of the legal teams is seeking broad powers over the case, including potential investigative powers into the missing cryptocurrencies and other asset issues.  Bennett Jones and McInnes Cooper explain that the firms already have experience in ""recovery issues,"" citing fraud and ponzi scheme investigations as two examples. The firms are hoping to ""properly investigate"" the Quadriga situation as part of its mandate.  Amanda McLachlan  , an investor who filed an affidavit in support of Bennett Jones, supported this application, saying that ""the appointment of Representative Counsel with experience in the area of investigations and asset tracing would not only assist the Monitor in the efficient administration of the CCAA process, but will ensure that appropriate recovery efforts will be performed to the benefit of the Affected Users.""  An affidavit by Parham Pakjou supporting the Miller Thomson bid focuses more specifically on different communication tasks, saying the appointment of this firm would free up EY to specifically look for the missing cryptocurrencies and recover funds.  Interestingly, Osler, Hoskins and Harcourt/Patterson Law's argument for their bid notes that it would receive assistance from a group of QuadrigaCX users who ""have impressive technical expertise, including the ability to understand, if not perform, blockchain analysis to trace blockchain transactions.""  EY and Quadriga's attorneys said they have no issue with any of the law firms being appointed as representative counsel, though they commented on what powers they believe the appointed firm should have.  Counsel's role  Specifically, EY believes representative counsel should be specifically tasked with communicating with creditors and advocating on their behalf over any issues that might arise.  The report says that ""it may be appropriate to temporarily limit the mandate of Rep Counsel appointed at this time to communicating and disseminating information to the Affected Users and advocating on behalf of Affected Users before the Court on preliminary issues raised in these CCAA proceedings,"" rather than approving any investigative work that the counsel might run through.  It explains that there are a number of concerns should representative counsel be given broad or investigative powers, including the potential duplication of efforts being conducted by EY.  This, in turn, might increase the representative counsel's costs, which would be passed on to Quadriga.  As EY explains:  ""The reasonable fees and expenses of representative counsel, as well as financial and other advisors, are frequently funded by the CCAA debtors’ estates. In such cases, the Courts frequently grant the representative counsel a charge to secure its fees and disbursements.""  Left unsaid was the possibility that the greater the law firm's costs are, the less creditors are likely to receive.  EY suggested placing a cap on the counsel's total billing ability as one solution.  For its part, EY says it is currently focused on locating Quadriga's assets and finding its missing cryptocurrency, though it has only just begun this work. The fact that the companies are early in the CCAA process is another reason to limit what powers the representative counsel might have, the filing states.  Christine Duhaime, a financial crimes lawyer, told CoinDesk that she would agree ""it is not appropriate for another law firm to be given broad power or even investigative powers,"" noting that the firms are ""lawyers, not investigators.""  The fact that the case deals with cryptocurrencies further compounds the issue, and could indeed lead to duplication of work as EY says, added Duhaime (who represented QuadrigaCX for five months in 2015).  Hasty appointment?  While not a formal notice of motion, another law firm, Goodmans LLP, has filed a letter to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court to also ask to be appointed representative counsel.  However, the firm is specifically calling for a creditors' committee to be formed to help select representative counsel first.  In its letter, the firm argues that ""there has not been sufficient notice of this selection process and that greater visibility and opportunity should be given both (i) to other creditors who may wish to come forward and serve on any creditors' committee to be appointed in this case and (ii) to other qualified and experienced law firms who may wish to present their credentials.""  Goodmans outlined a proposal wherein Quadriga or EY would publicize information about a committee, which would then be formed and could work with the court and the exchange to select the representative counsel.  Duhaime said she agrees with this proposal, calling it ""both reasonable and more cost-effective.""  Reiterating her earlier point about expertise in the cryptocurrency space, she noted that while every law firm has experience with bankruptcies and class action lawsuits, few are familiar with cryptocurrencies.  ""The process should be opened up for more large firms with digital currency expertise to present proposals,"" she said.
