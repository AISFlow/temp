42431534,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN37Nh,1581110408,Why DeFi's Billion-Dollar Milestone Matters,"It was only December when the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) market was worth less than $700 million. Early this morning, it hit $1 billion, a figure that even the most fervent blockchain skeptics would have a tough time dismissing as meaningless.      That figure is the measure of all the crypto held in projects that lend, hedge, abstract, swap or otherwise make structured bets using ethereum's smart-contract powers, as totaled by DeFi Pulse, which first showed the collective market at $1 billion at 8:00 UTC Friday.      To be clear, $1 billion is not how much money people are making on DeFi, but how much they have committed. Their “locked-in” collateral is used on various protocols to make a wide array of bets, from simple loans to complex derivatives.      At press time, the figure had dropped back to $993.3 million, but the billion-dollar milestone has been broken nevertheless, and most people in the space believe it's a sign of greater things to come.      ""It proves that people around the world want access to more efficient, less biased, money,"" Rune Christensen, the creator of DeFi leader MakerDAO, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson.      MakerDAO has consistently held the top spot on DeFi Pulse, as the protocol with the most ETH as collateral – some 60 percent of the market.      “$1 Billion marks an important milestone for DeFi to be celebrated,” DeFi Pulse wrote on its blog. “Additionally, $1B feels like an early birthday present for DeFi Pulse which was launched in February 2019.” The website has become something of a standard in this nascent industry.      DeFi Pulse was not alone in its bullish tone. Investor Spencer Noon of DTC Capital struck a similar note in an email to CoinDesk:    ""No other smart contract platform comes close in terms of its developer mindshare, tooling, and infrastructure, to the point where I don’t believe DeFi could exist anywhere else today. And perhaps most surprisingly, we’re finally seeing a credible case for ETH to accrue a long-term monetary premium as the only truly trustless collateral type in decentralized finance.""  Unpacking $1B    Each hour, DeFi Pulse totals all the ETH and ERC-20 tokens locked inside public DeFi protocols and logs the ""total value locked"" (TVL) on a graph at the top of the page.      Of course, that number is mostly ETH, which currently represents 70 percent of the value. As such, the number can be a little misleading because denominating it in dollars exposes the figure to crypto's volatility. In other words, a hard spike in ETH prices (the asset is up 21 percent over the last week) would drive TVL up even if no one else put any more coins in.      In fact, when weighed in terms of locked-up ETH, the chart line is going down, not up, over the last seven days. ""Of course some of the DeFi milestone is due to ETH appreciation, but, regardless, we have crossed the inflection point between the bear markets of 2018 and 2019 and are poised for a bull market in 2020,"" CoinFund's Jake Brukhman said in an email.      Ryan Sean Adams, a crypto investor and ETH booster on Twitter, tweeted the news, writing: ""Software eating money. Software eating banks. The next decade will be wild.""      But nothing big happens on ethereum without bitcoin diehards mocking it. In this case, former bitcoin developer Peter Todd weighed in, tweeting, ""Decentralized smart contracts can't hold people accountable for debt. For that you need guns.""      Either way, a billion dollars is still tiny. Just take commercial lending in the U.S. alone. That's an $800 billion market, according to data firm IBISWorld. DeFi has a long way to go.      And rapid growth doesn't always continue. For comparison, Kickstarter, the leading crowdfunding site, launched in 2009. It hit $1 billion in pledges in 2014. Six years later, it still hasn't quite touched $5 billion.      Still, DeFi got there a lot quicker, and it's much more complex than crowdfunding.      ""This historic milestone is a large part due to numerous factors that have coalesced,"" Felix Feng of Set Protocol, which automates investing, told CoinDesk in an email. He sees improvements in things like composability and smart-contract security bringing more users in.      Robert Leshner, founder of Compound, another leading DeFi protocol, said the milestone showed that users were finding ways to use crypto more trustlessly, with less reliance on exchanges.""Satoshi would be extremely proud,” he told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/07/why-defis-billion-dollar-milestone-matters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9bad2e22f5fa5584b2cfcaa8a11a19f309b94be1-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431536,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN37Th,1581105004,Appealing to Normies: Advancing Bitcoin Starts With Better UX,"Why isn't the average person into bitcoin?      That was the question posed by Blockstream's Selene Jin at the Advancing Bitcoin conference in London on Thursday, in a room with some of the most hardcore bitcoiners on the planet.      Jin pointed out that bitcoiners on Twitter tend to argue that: ""Normies don't understand money, have no long-term vision or the ability to think outside the box.""      But she has a different opinion of what's holding back broader adoption. More ""normies"" might use bitcoin if the user experience (UX) was better, if – in Silicon Valley tech speak – they were ""delighted"" to use the apps and felt ""empowered"" by them, she argued.      Jin's comments at the two-day event spoke to the difficulty of moving the needle on crypto adoption, even with 11 years under bitcoin's belt.      ""Bitcoin UX improved a lot [over the years]. But there are ways we can improve that to push bitcoin even further,"" Jin, Blockstream's director of UX, said. She argued that most developers try to build an app with the features they want themselves, which isn't necessarily what the average Joe is looking for.      UX is often overlooked in bitcoin's often very technical community. Jin argued that bitcoiners are fascinated by the new currency for a variety of reasons: monetary revolution, technological exploration and getting rich. (She's in it for all three, she said.)      ""I'm trying to help fix the user experience here because if we don't do that, these three things can't happen,"" Jin said.    Less-confusing bitcoin accounts    With the halving around the corner, it could be a particularly good time to focus on improving bitcoin's user experience.      If the price goes up (which is still a big ""if"" that people are debating profusely), it could bring in a lot of new users, as is the pattern for bitcoin over the past decade.      ""Think of it like 'Hungry Hungry Hippos,'"" Coinfloor exchange founder and CEO Obi Nwosu said in a panel, referencing the 1980s children's game. ""When it comes, each exchange will be trying to get as many customers as possible. We need a service that deals with their requirements,"" he added, nodding to Jin's talk.      One little-known proposal discussed at the event was to make memorizing bitcoin addresses as easy as memorizing a phone number.      Right now that's far from the case. Instead of being fewer than 10 digits, bitcoin addresses, where bitcoin is stored and transaction IDs are long, random strings of letters and numbers.      ""There is no way anyone can memorize it – unless you're someone who memorizes digits of pi for fun. These IDs are always communicated by copy and paste,"" bitcoin developer and educator Jimmy Song said.      That's why, when he saw a proposal for EasyPaySy posted to the bitcoin developer email list, he was intrigued. EasyPaySy allows these accounts to be represented in a much easier form, as short and human-readable as a phone number or as readable as an email address.      This approach isn't without downsides.      It would require more data to be stored on the bitcoin blockchain (the more slimmed down, the easier it is for more users to run). Plus, users potentially have to spend more time backing up such accounts. One attendee argued that the debacle involving economist and bitcoin critic Peter Schiff recently ""losing his bitcoin password"" showed that taking care of one's bitcoin is already hard enough as is for many people.      Still, Song argued that the benefits might outweigh the disadvantages.    From the bottom up    But user-facing improvements aren't the only changes being considered. Many UX improvements start at the lowest levels of the bitcoin code.      The faster developers can build new features, the faster they can bubble up to users. This realm of UX problems was probably the biggest focus of Advancing Bitcoin.      One such improvement revolves around ""testnet,"" a network that's like a dummy clone of bitcoin where developers test their apps and new bitcoin features to get a better idea of how they'll work in the real world.      Bitcoin Core contributor Kalle Alm has been building SigNet, an alternative that he describes as ""testnet, but without all the broken parts."" The network is notoriously unreliable and ""reorgs"" all the time, an event where transactions that were considered legit for a short time, aren't anymore. This bump is much less common on the real bitcoin network.      Plus, there are people mining testnet coins and earning no money from it, since the mined dummy coins are supposed to be free. Alm argues there isn't a point to this, since decentralization, achieved with the help of mining, isn't really required on testnet.      ""I don't even know what [testnet miners] are doing. No government is gonna come in and say, 'Give me the test coins!'"" Alm said.      With these problems fixed, Alm thinks SigNet could play a big role in testing network-wide features added to bitcoin. For example, developers could soon use it to test Schnorr and Taproot, a privacy and scalability-focused bundle of changes that's been making progress this year.      But SigNet is just the tip of the iceberg. New bitcoin smart contract language Miniscript, unveiled last year, was the subject of several talks at the conference. Smart contracts require various conditions to be met in order to unlock and send funds, such as not allowing bitcoins to be sent up until a certain day.      Bitcoin's built-in smart contract language Script is notoriously difficult to use, but Miniscript makes it easier for more developers to give it a shot, with the potential of making these smart contracts more available for more users.

42374492,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZzrl,1581104018,New 'TRUMP' Token Giving 62% Odds of US President's Reelection,"U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted last year he isn’t a huge fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  They’re “not money,” he wrote in July, saying their value is “highly volatile and based on thin air.""  Now, crypto traders outside the U.S. can make their feelings known – and perhaps some money – on the 45th U.S. president. This week a digital token, Trump 2020 with the symbol TRUMP, launched courtesy of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.  FTX says the new token will work like a futures contract, allowing traders to take long positions (Trump wins) or short ones (total loser).  “TRUMP expires to $1 if Donald Trump wins the 2020 U.S. presidential general election, and $0 otherwise,” FTX says in a posting on its website.  Some online sites, such as Oddschecker.com, have set up venues to bet on the coming election, which is shaping up to be historic: Trump is expected to be the first incumbent president to face voters following an impeachment trial. The president was acquitted Wednesday by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate of impeachment articles brought by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.  But the new FTX contract might represent the crypto industry's first attempt to cash in on the polarized voter climate surrounding Trump’s 2020 prospects.  Theoretically, the token’s price should track roughly in line with the perceived odds of a Trump victory.  “If you think there's a 52 percent chance of Trump winning, then TRUMP should trade at $0.52,” according to FTX. “Buying below there would be good, as would selling above $0.52.”  The token, which went live earlier this week, is currently trading at 62 cents after Trump’s acquittal, implying a 62 percent chance he'll get four more years in Washington.  FTX is owned by a parent company based in Antigua and Barbuda, according to the firm's websitehttps://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029839371-About-FTX. It's led by Sam Bankman-Fried. His LinkedIn profile shows him to be a former trader with the New York-based firm Jane Street who jumped into the crypto industry in 2017. He’s now based in Hong Kong.  For traders leery of the risks of volatile crypto markets, FTX posts a warning on the binary nature of the TRUMP token’s ultimate payoff: Price swings might be even more volatile than the notoriously up-now, down-now bitcoin. (Bitcoin is up 36 percent so far this year to about $9,800, after the price nearly doubled in 2019.)  “The risk profile of TRUMP is different from BTC,” according to the website. “It has significantly higher chances of making a large move (to $0 or $1).”  Addressing the potential for irregularities in the general election, the new TRUMP token comes with terms mapping out a contingency plan if the results are muddy and Trump refuses to leave office: “In the event that some set of electoral votes cannot be projected” and it’s impossible to determine the winner, “this contract will settle to $1 if Donald Trump is still president on February 1st, 2021, and $0 otherwise.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/07/new-trump-token-giving-62-odds-of-us-presidents-reelection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f795e86f4a5de5581347a5a8aa72f16e26a2326-1200x888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Thursday, Judge Kevin P. Castel of the Southern District of New York issued an order inviting the CFTC's office of the general counsel ""to express its views on the issues presently before the Court."" The opinion can be submitted in writing, the judge said.      Whether ""gram,"" the cryptocurrency of Telegram's TON blockchain, is a security or a commodity has been the main question of the four-month-long litigation. The SEC insists the not-yet-issued grams were sold to investors as securities, with the expectation of future profits.      Telegram maintains that, just like bitcoin and ether, once grams are issued they will be a commodity – simply the native token of the TON blockchain.      In a memorandum previously submitted to court, the SEC said there's no way grams could be considered a commodity as “the value of that asset will have depended and will still depend on Telegram’s efforts to increase demand for and, thus, increase the value of that asset as purchasers reasonably expected and will expect.”      ""Unlike gold, comic books and Krispy Kreme donuts – commodities Telegram compares to Grams – Grams have no intrinsic value,” the SEC argues, so the value of grams relies exclusively on Telegram’s efforts to create a blockchain, and this, according to the Howey test, is a feature of a security.      Telegram, in its responding memorandum, argued it had never marketed grams as an investment tool, but all the marketing materials ""clearly and primarily emphasized the intended consumptive value of Grams as 'the first mass-market cryptocurrency.'"" The main value proposition has been that the tokens will be widely adopted by users when TON is live, the memorandum goes.      The CFTC has previously stated that cryptocurrencies ""such as bitcoin"" meet the definition of a commodity but the agency has not expressed its opinion on token sales like Telegram's. In a joint Wall Street Journal op-ed in 2018, SEC and CFTC chairmen Jay Clayton and Christopher Giancarlo said that ""many of the internet-based cryptocurrency trading platforms have registered as payment services and are not subject to direct oversight by the SEC or the CFTC.""

42431533,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN37Rh,1581098100,"Now More Than Ever, SEC Is Scrutinizing Unregistered Token Offerings","News about initial coin offerings (ICOs) is back with a vengeance. Only this time, it's not about how much money there is to be raised, but how much money there is to be paid back.      In January, two new ICOs completed in 2018 were charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with fraudulent sales of unregistered digital asset securities. The individuals and entities charged in these cases are still awaiting a final judgment and fine. However, in both cases, the SEC has recommended all funds raised by the ICOs be paid back to investors.      ICOBench reports that, as of Feb. 6, almost 5,700 projects have collectively raised over $27 billion since the first ICO in July 2014. ICOs are a way to fund early stages of a crypto venture by selling a certain number of tokens created by the startup in advance of product launch. New breeds of ICOs called initial exchange offerings (IEOs), which capitalize on the sale of exchange tokens specifically, have begun to emerge in the last year.      For now, token sales of any sort that are sold to U.S. residents and not registered with the SEC remain in violation of federal securities laws and subject to fines.      The SEC issued warnings as recently as last month advising individuals and entities against participating in or launching ICOs.      SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has proposed safe havens for companies launching token sales to help nurture early-stage blockchain network growth and development. But right now the frequency of ICO-related charges has been rising each year.      Consider: Between 2016 and 2020, the SEC filed charges against 27 completed ICOs. This number does not include the number of ongoing investigations by the regulator or the cases that have yet to publicly disclose settlement terms.      As a result of the SEC's strong enforcement, there has been greater caution among cryptocurrency investors who have participated, or are planning to participate, in this form of fundraising. ICOBench reports the total monthly funds raised by ICOs declined from a high of $3.45 billion in 2018 to $18 million at the start of 2019.      How the SEC operates    The majority of token offerings the SEC has gone after were completed during the ICO boom of 2017 when over 550 sales raised $7.3 billion, according to figures from Smith and Crown. However, the earliest recorded token sale to have been penalized by the SEC was completed in May 2014 during the offering for “Sianotes,” which ultimately raised $120,000.      In 2016, the Boston-based Nebulous, which conducted the Sianotes offering, was required to pay back the full amount raised during the offering, plus $24,602 in prejudgement interest and a civil money penalty of $80,000.      The three main monetary weapons at the disposal of the SEC to fine companies that conduct unregistered securities offerings are disgorgement, civil penalties and prejudgment interest.      Disgorgement is the repayment to investors of gains the SEC deems to be from illegal or unethical actions. It is meant to be a restorative rather than a punitive charge.      Civil penalties, on the other hand, are intended as a punishment for wrongdoing, with the harshest penalties handed down on cases with clear evidence of fraud and substantial risk of or actual investor harm.      Finally, prejudgement interest is a calculated fee based on the amount of disgorgement and civil penalties that has been negotiated during a trial.      The SEC can also seek remedy for the violation of federal securities laws by placing injunctions and restrictions on an individual’s ability to work in the securities industry or serve as an officer or director of a public company. The SEC cannot, however, put people in jail.    Notable cases    Looking at the SEC’s punitive charges over time against companies or individuals that have conducted ICOs, amounts vary wildly from $0 to as much as $24 million. In the cases where there was no civil penalty, the SEC specified its rationale in filings, highlighting the remedial actions already taken by the company or individual.      For example, in the case of Gladius, a Nevada-based blockchain cybersecurity services company, the SEC wrote that the company took “prompt” remedial steps to self-report to the commission, cooperated with SEC staff and promised to comply with federal securities laws in future.      The largest civil penalty ever handed down by the SEC for an ICO was against Block.One, the startup that raised the largest amount of money ever in a token offering. Between June 2017 and June 2018, Block.One managed to sell $4.1 billion worth of its EOS ERC-20 token. In September 2019, the SEC levied a $24 million fine for conducting an unregistered securities sale.      Not all civil penalties are proportional to the amount raised in offerings.    ‘More art than science’    The SEC also looks at factors other than the amount raised when judging which offering companies to go after and how much to penalize, according to securities lawyer Mark Hunter. These factors include (but are not limited to) where the victims and wrongdoers are located, whether or not there is an identifiable group that was targeted for a sale and the “press-worthiness” of a company, individual or product.      “Are they [the company or individual] the hot topic of the month or quarter?” Hunter said, referencing cases like Block.One, which received wide news coverage for being the largest ICO in history.      At the end of the day, measuring how the SEC picks and handles its cases is “more art than science,” Hunter said. “There were times when [I] was sure the SEC was going to go after a particular person or group and they didn’t. Other times, when [I] thought this didn’t seem like something the SEC would use its resources for and they’re all over it. Anybody that could forecast with certainty would be some extremely successful counsel.”    What to expect in 2020    In the first month of 2020, the SEC has already laid charges against two new ICOs. The amount of disgorgement, civil penalty and prejudgement interest has not yet been settled for these cases.      Given the lack of transparency into the process, details such as the timing and state of SEC investigations into ICOs that are ongoing or soon to launch are difficult to predict. What can be expected with some level of certainty from public filings in years prior is the number of charges is set to increase significantly this year.      As the number of SEC-penalized ICOs goes up, the importance of regulatory compliance for investors strengthens. High-profile cases carried over from 2019, such as the Telegram and Kik ICOs, will act as important bellwethers for U.S. regulatory sentiment regarding blockchain technology and its reach in consumer markets. The outcome of Peirce’s “Token Safe Harbor” proposal unveiled this month will also be a crucial signal from regulators to the public.      Each new enforcement action this year will teach us much about ICO financing and business models, and the SEC's regulatory focus. The creation of new ICOs, IEOs and other forms of financial innovation in the crypto markets is be affected, for better or for worse.

The February contract crossed above the psychological hurdle and printed a high of $10,030 at 11:40 UTC, a level last seen on Oct. 26.      The breakout into five figures, however, was short-lived as prices quickly pared gains to trade below $10,000. At press time, the futures are trading near $9,850.

The uptick in futures is backed by a surge in open positions on major exchanges like the CME and Bakkt. Open interest, the number of open futures contracts on the CME, jumped to a five-month high of $249 million on Wednesday – up 34.5 percent from $185 million seen two weeks ago. Meanwhile, open positions on Bakkt, rose to a record high of $13 million on Wednesday, surpassing the previous record high of $12 million reached on Feb. 3, according to data analytics firm Skew.

Backing the round are a number of VC firms including DNX Ventures, Battery Ventures, Epic Ventures, Commerce Ventures and Wildcat Ventures. Existing investors Leap Global Partners and BlueRun Ventures also took part.      Paystand aims to makes complex commercial transactions and payments ""as easy and fast for enterprises as Venmo has done for basic consumer-to-consumer transactions,"" according to a press release on Thursday.      The firm's service is based on a blockchain network that it says provides ""real-time, fund-verified"" payments, allowing businesses to move money around instantly. Paystand says it digitizes and automates the payment lifecycle, from invoice to reconciliation, by integrating with client businesses' databases.      “We made a promise to reboot commercial finance because it’s insecure, inefficient and built on trustless networks and technology,"" Paystand CEO Jeremy Almond said in the announcement. ""Today marks another step towards realizing that vision and transforming enterprise finance.""      The company said the fresh investment would allow it to speed expansion of its services, and build out the sales, marketing and engineering teams at its California and Guadalajara, Mexico, offices.      Speaking of why his firm joined the $20 million fundraise, Mitch Kitamura, managing director of DNX Ventures, said in a blog post: ""Consumers have seemingly endless payment options, many of which offer near-instant payments with little to no fees. ... Businesses lack the same options.""

Known as Dragon Payments Ltd. since July, the firm announced Thursday that it had been placed into compulsory liquidation on Jan. 31. Paul Cooper and Paul Appleton of David Rubin & Partners were appointed as joint liquidators earlier this week by the U.K.'s Secretary of State for Business.      In a statement that has now entirely replaced its website, the company said: ""The Joint Liquidators and their team are working toward resolving customers’ concerns, including the recovery of any sums owed, as a matter of priority.""      LBX launched in 2017 after raising more than £2 million (roughly $2.6 million USD) from investors, according to Business Insider. The company had initially planned to issue prepaid cards allowing users to shop with cryptocurrencies, but it pivoted in 2018 to become a mobile exchange for U.K. investors.      In April 2019, LBX was taken to court by one of its creditors in a bid to recover a debt. Then-CEO Benjamin Dives, who ran the company until the liquidation order, told CoinDesk at the time that £9,900 (approximately $12,900) had not been paid on time. He also denied rumors the company was facing liquidation.      Podcast host Peter McCormack had claimed the same month that LBX was ""insolvent"" (in a tweet now deleted) and that employees had not been paid since 2018. The company declined to comment on these claims.      LBX's filing history at Companies House, the national registrar for businesses in the U.K., has not been updated to include the compulsory liquidation order.

Senior politicians from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by former economy minister Akira Amari, told reporters Friday that Japan should share information and technical studies with the U.S. and other G-7 members in order to respond to China's digital yuan initiative, which could pose a serious challenge to the greenback's global supremacy, Reuters reported.      “We live in a stable world led by dollar settlement. How should we respond if such a foundation collapses and if [China’s move] gives rise to a struggle for currency supremacy?” Amari said. As this year's G-7 chair, the U.S. should include digital currency on the agenda for the next meeting of the group, he added      A formal proposal calling for greater cooperation with the G-7 on the matter of digital currencies will be officially presented to the government next week, the group confirmed. The G-7 are expected to meet in Maryland this coming June.      Japan, like many other countries, relies heavily on a dollar-denominated settlement system that allows its banks and businesses to transact all around the world. The Japanese economy could face significant disruption should developing nations begin using the digital yuan instead of the greenback.      On Wednesday, a Federal Reserve governor said the U.S. central bank was ""conducting research and experimentation"" into digital currencies so it can properly evaluate risks and benefits. It would also allow the U.S. to lead in the matter, the governor added. Fed officials are said to be concerned by private initiatives like Libra and the effects they could have on the global financial system.      The LDP group of lawmakers said in late January it would propose Japan issue its own digital currency in a joint project between the government and the private sector.      Last month, the Bank of Japan formed a working group with five other central banks, including the U.K. and the EU, to coordinate and share research into digital currencies. The group will reportedly have its first meeting in Washington D.C. during the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference in mid-April.      During Friday's press conference, lawmakers argued Japan should prepare to issue its own digital yen.

42403972,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh7Nd,1581074420,Bitcoin Has Erased Over 45% of 2019 Sell-Off in Just 7 Weeks,"View  Bitcoin's bullish momentum is staying strong and resistance at $10,000 could soon be put to the test.  A break higher would expose the October high of $10,350.  The hourly chart shows $9,850 has emerged as resistance in the last 24 hours. Another rejection at the newfound hurdle could yield a minor pullback to $9,600.    Bitcoin is continuing to pile on the gains.      The number one cryptocurrency by market value rose to a three-month high of $9,859 during the U.S. trading hours on Thursday and was last seen trading at $9,801, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      With the surge to multi-month highs, bitcoin has recovered a significant portion of the ground lost in the second half of 2019.      Bitcoin's bull move from the April 2019 low of $4,100 topped out at $13,880 at the end of June. The bears seized control in July and ended up pushing prices to below $7,000 by the end of November.      December, therefore, began on a negative note with prominent analysts calling for a deeper drop to $6,000 or below on miner selling of the digital asset.      The decline, however, was cut short at the seven-month low of $6,425 on Dec. 18. Since then the cryptocurrency has risen sharply by more than $3,300.      The speed of the ascent has been impressive – nearly 46 percent of the decline from $13,880 to $6,425 seen in the 25 weeks to Dec. 18 has been reversed in just seven weeks.      With the bulls in control and momentum looking quite strong, the cryptocurrency could soon rise into five figures.    Daily chart    The daily chart looks constructive with the cryptocurrency printing bullish higher highs and higher lows with each passing week.      Confirming the uptrend are the ascending five- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) and a bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-day MAs. The MACD histogram, meanwhile, is printing higher bars above the zero line, indicating a strengthening of bullish momentum.      Importantly, the market is showing no signs of bull fatigue. The 14-day relative strength index is yet to cross into overbought territory above 70 and the cryptocurrency continues to print solid green candles with small wicks, a sign there is no hesitation among buyers while pushing prices higher.      So, the odds appear stacked in favor of a rise to the October high of $10,350. Pullbacks, if any, could find take the support of the ascending five- and 10-day MAs located at $9,526 and $9,445, respectively.    Hourly chart    Bitcoin has faced rejection near $9,850 two times in the last 24 hours. Another failure might see some buyers opting to take their profits, leading to a minor price pullback to $9,635 (horizontal support line). Acceptance below that level might bring in deeper losses toward $9,500.

42403957,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh78s,1581070000,RSK Launches Interoperability Bridge Between Bitcoin and Ethereum,"The parent company behind the bitcoin-based smart contract platform RSK has launched a token bridge joining it to ethereum.      Gibraltar-based developer IOV Labs said this week its newly released interoperability bridge would allow users to cross RSK- and ethereum-based digital assets, including ether and ERC-20 tokens, across the different protocols.      When a user transfers tokens, the bridge's smart contract locks the originals and mints a corresponding amount of new tokens on the other chain. Using the system, ether-based tokens can be transformed into RSK's RRC20 tokens, which conversely can be turned into ethereum ERC777 tokens.      Interoperability protocols make it easier for projects to operate on different blockchains. Decentralized apps (dapps) can cater to a broader base of users, who would otherwise remain siloed in closed networks, and projects can leverage specific characteristics of different blockchains simultaneously.      “Interoperability has been a cornerstone of the RSK vision from the start,"" explained Adrian Eidelman, RSK Strategist at IOV Labs. ""We believe being able to offer Bitcoin’s benefits to Ethereum users and to connect these respective developer communities is a crucial step for the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.""      There are other protocols offering interoperability between bitcoin and ethereum: Wanchain launched a token bridge between the two networks in 2018. Edelman told CoinDesk that while Wanchain focuses on connecting blockchains by being a ""middleman,"" RSK is different in that it actually combines the networks, allowing both ecosystems to leverage the other's strengths.      Bitcoin stablecoin protocol Money on Chain, which uses bitcoin as collateral for new tokens, has already said it will use the new RSK bridge to cross its stablecoins onto the ethereum ecosystem. The project's co-founder Max Carjuzaa said the new interoperability would combine the security and ""global recognition of Bitcoin with the vibrant DeFi ecosystem currently developed in Ethereum.”      Last September, IOV labs said it would integrate RSK tokens into its newly acquired Spanish-language social media network, Taringa.

42403965,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh7Hj,1581066000,Platform Allowing Trading of Crypto in Custody Completes First $100K Transaction,"A new institutional settlement solution that allows clients to trade directly from their custodial accounts has completed its first transaction.      Digital asset trading infrastructure provider SettleBit announced this week it had successfully transferred $100,000 in bitcoin from Prycto Digital to CMT Digital in roughly 10 minutes using a claimed first-of-its-kind settlement layer to facilitate a transfer that kept digital assets in BitGo's cold storage.      SettleBit is the first settlement layer to be directly integrated into custodian, according to CEO Leor Tasman, who is also one of the founders at Prycto Digital. It allows institutional clients to trade cryptocurrencies without any settlement risk. Trades happen simultaneously through an atomic settlement system within the custodian itself that requires both parties to approve it before going through.      The settlement layer is designed to protect trades from theft and so that neither side can renege on the deal midway through. ""There is no single second in time where one party holds the other party's funds,"" Tasman told CoinDesk. Because funds never actually leave cold storage at any point during the transaction, they remain fully insured.      The solution, which connects BitGo custodial accounts using an API integration, relies on liquidity providers to match price offers with the best quotes on either the buy or sell side. Initially restricted to bitcoin, ether and US dollars, SettleBit plans to add other assets in the near future.      The feature is currently only available to BitGo clients who have an established trading relationship with SettleBit. But the company will expand its settlement layer to other custodial solutions so it can facilitate secure cross-custody trading. Tasman confirmed to CoinDesk that Kingdom Trust clients would be integrated later this quarter.      BitGo had previously partnered with Genesis Global Trading to create a similar custodial settlement solution. Work began in January 2019 but no trades have yet been processed.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/07/platform-allowing-trading-of-crypto-in-custody-completes-first-100k-transaction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/654840f355efe33a4b6a504293dee2452b16b45d-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Prime Trust began offering custody services for the crypto industry in late 2018, serving crypto firms like Binance, OKCoin and Bittrex, to name a few.      Prime Trust will perform know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks for the exchange, as well as provide FDIC-insured bank accounts for the exchange’s customers. The custodian will also provide custody for customer fiat and cold storage for crypto.      Crypto-friendly banking services are extremely rare, in part because of the extra work that banks must complete to comply with KYC and AML regulations. Prime Trust farms its deposits out to other banks to provide FDIC coverage for customers of crypto firms.      BlockQuake has begun a testing phase in which the exchange is open to a limited number of customers. The firm aims to launch fully sometime during Q2 2020, but in the meantime is testing its ability to conduct the legally-required KYC checks, hold deposits, execute trades and operate other features of its wallet.      The firm also applied for a New York State BitLicense with the New York Department of Financial Services in January 2020, and is registered with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network as a money services business.      “As cryptocurrency trading grows in popularity, the need to regulate the industry and mitigate risk for investors is paramount,” Antonio Brasse, CEO of BlockQuake, said in a press release. “We are seeing new cryptocurrency regulations come into play almost daily.
