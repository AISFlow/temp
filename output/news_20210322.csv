42434009,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7CHh,1616457195,What Is BitClout? The Social Media Experiment Sparking Controversy on Twitter,"Prominent users of Crypto Twitter have suddenly discovered they have another profile on a new social network called BitClout, except over there some people are buying and selling tokens representing their identities. It does not matter whether the people behind those profiles have ever touched the social network.      ""The core insight behind BitClout is that if you can mix speculation and content together, you can not only get a 10x product that creates innovative ways for creators to monetize, but you also get a new business model that's not ad-driven anymore,"" BitClout's lead creator, who goes by Diamondhands, told CoinDesk in a phone call.      BitClout is not a company. It is a proof-of-work blockchain designed for running social media. It was created by an anonymous group of developers. Backers only hold its token, BTCLT. Nevertheless, a set of prominent investors and crypto businesses have bought in.      This has been unpersuasive to many prominent members of the industry, who by and large seem to particularly object to their images and Twitter profiles being scraped and copied onto a whole other website.      BitClout is social media on a blockchain (like Hive, Steem or Cent). It also generates social tokens (like Roll or Rally), which represent actual people. Those social tokens' supplies are controlled by automated market makers (like Uniswap or Curve), though one governed by a bonding curve that explicitly ratchets up the value as more tokens get minted.      In order to do anything on the site, users need to get their hands on BTCLT. To really trade, that means putting in BTC to get BTCLT, but there's no way to trade it back. Users can send BTC to BitClout for BTCLT but they can't trade it back to BTC on the site.      James Prestwich, the founder of Summa (acquired by the operators of Celo last summer), has been highly critical of BitClout – and that's one of his key reasons.      ""There's no venue to sell BitClout,"" Prestwich told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""You can put money in but you can't get money out.""      Diamondhands said the platform welcomes exchange listings and bridges to other blockchains. It includes exchanges among its investors, and hopes listings should come soon.      ""To me, it's just a matter of time before everybody sees where the right side of history is,"" Diamondhands said.    The tokens    According to Diamondhands, there was a pre-mine of 2 million BTCLT tokens for founders and investors. There's technically no supply cap on BTCLT, he explained, but the cost of new emissions will become so high at some point they don't expect any more will be purchased after the supply hits something like 19 million.      Miners securing the network will also earn BTCLT, but that's only about 500,000 over the next few years.      In order to convince creators that this was not a project that would cut and run with BTC put into the system, BitClout sought the backing of major investors in crypto.      Diamondhands sent CoinDesk a list of investors via email, which included: Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Social Capital, TQ Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Winklevoss Capital, Arrington Capital, Polychain, Pantera, Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk's parent company), Huobi, Variant and others.      Diamondhands said that he and his co-creators felt like they needed those well-known names to make creators feel confident the project was real.      BitClout runs on a proof-of-work blockchain much like Bitcoin’s, but one designed to hold the text of social media posts. The BTCLT token is used as gas and will likely eventually be used in a governance process that manages the project's BTC treasury. The code will be open-sourced on the BitClout site soon and when that happens others will be able to join permissionlessly as nodes or as miners, Diamondhands said.      CoinDesk agreed to respect pseudonymity at the start of our discussions. Diamondhands said the creators are hiding their identities in order to keep the project decentralized in spirit as well as fact.    Social media    Crypto social networks are not new, but Diamondhands argues the key innovation with BitClout is that it emphasizes the value of the creator, not their content.      ""The platforms that have existed up to today, really focus on speculating on the post as the atomic unit, rather than on the creator. And there's a very big difference, because posts are short term,"" Diamondhands said. ""That makes it not really very exciting as an asset class. Whereas if you have a creator that you can speculate on, that's a very long-term thing that you can really invest in for a long time.""    Read more: Jack Dorsey’s First Tweet Sells for $2.9M    The notion of being creative and boosting one's value is powerful, but others see a darker side.      Lumi is a blockchain researcher who has been digging deep into BitClout since it started driving conversation last week, shortly after launch.      ""People are incentivized to cancel people,"" Lumi told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""All you have to do is open a short position and then try to mangle someone's reputation.""      He further objected to the qualitative experience of BitClout. Sending money to a crypto address in order to get tokens back is the same spirit and feel of the early initial coin offering rush of 2017. He doesn't like seeing those kinds of optics return to the space, only with marquee names.      But the lure of a pre-existing pool that appears to have already accrued value could be alluring.      For creators with reserved accounts, a certain number of their tokens have been set aside for them already for whenever they choose to activate. That said, users don't need to wait for an account to be activated in order to speculate on such tokens, which could be part of why many Crypto Twitter denizens are so uneasy about this new project.      A former CoinDesk employee who has not yet activated their BitClout account already has two dozen accounts that hold their coin.      This reporter's profile (which has not been activated and has not sold any tokens) is shown as having a $12,000 market cap.      That's based on the idea that 32 tokens have been minted and set aside for the profile of @BradyDale. If anyone wanted to buy one more, it would cost around $400, so the ""market cap"" assumes all 33 would fetch that price. (Each token that gets sold slightly increases the price of the next token to sell. The website then lists a market cap as if the whole supply would sell at that price.)    But, as the white paperhttps://bitclout.com/one_pager.pdf?password=b04d50e0cf1f0472a2f03398632e1e3aab763f60b80d417d3ae186109153da83 explains:  ""Buying creates coins while pushing the price up and locking money into the profile, while selling destroys coins while pushing the price down and unlocking money from the profile.""    So it seems fair to say that the market caps of the tokens are overstated, at a minimum. ""This is engineered to show people paper gains very quickly so they will put in more money and buy more BitClout,"" Prestwich said.      ""I dont think it's a 'scam' though. People use that term way too loosely,"" Castle Island Ventures' Nic Carter, who had not activated his account nor invested, told CoinDesk. ""I think it's certainly got some Ponzi-like features, but so does everything now. Every consumer app is gamified. Frequent flier miles are basically a Ponzi.""    Getting in    A user doesn't need to be on Twitter to create an account, but to activate a reserved account, a user needs to tweet out their BitClout address. This verifies legitimate owners, Diamondhands said, but no doubt the publicity also helps.      Once an account has been activated, its owner can set a sort of tax on new token emissions if they so choose. So each time someone makes a purchase of their token that increases total supply, some portion of that would go to the person the token represents.      Celebrity accounts and various crypto denizens with preloaded accounts already will find that they also have a certain amount of their tokens set aside for them now. The amount was set proportional to their followers, according to Diamondhands. There were about 15,000 pre-loaded accounts, all based on Twitter.      If a BitClout page doesn't have a blue check next to it, the person it represents has not actually activated on the blockchain, but the rest of their basic content from Twitter is already there.      Up to now, it has required an invitation from a user to access the website, but Diamondhands said that will change shortly. Also, a user doesn't have to pair an account with a Twitter account. In fact, if someone wants to stay anonymous and just buy people's tokens from a wallet, they can do that, too.      ""The awesome thing about BitClout is it lets you be totally anonymous, which most platforms in general don't even allow,"" Diamondhands said.    Driving demand    ""What got me excited about the project is what I call 'fundamental demand,' which is where the creator monetizing on the platform is actually what drives the value,"" Diamondhands said.      The users and their posts on BitClout are an underlying data structure that any web application can access. Sites that publish BitClout content and allow people to interact with it are nodes. With this open data structure, sites can invent new ways for creators to monetize or give people incentives to hold their tokens.      Diamondhands contends that larger objections will be worked out in time, as exchange listings come to enable people to exit positions and new nodes spin up new experiences for users. It's also open to bridges to other chains.      ""Any platform that wants to implement an atomic swap from BitClout onto their chain, that would just be such an amazing thing,"" he said.      UPDATE (March 23, 16:12 UTC): This post has been revised to remove an erroneous mention of BitClout using an atomic swap with the bitcoin blockchain.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/22/what-is-bitclout-the-social-media-experiment-sparking-controversy-on-twitter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Slipping 2.98% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $55,685.09-$58,407.62 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades below its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin entered the week seeking a direction, with subdued trading volume and exchange inflows continuing to drop.      “There's not much action, and prices have been stable around the $56,000-$58,000 mark,” Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter (OTC) bitcoin broker, told CoinDesk.      As of March 21, there were fewer than 2.44 million BTC available on exchanges, the lowest amount since August 2018, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.      The decreased bitcoin balances on exchanges have been seen as a bullish sign – that fewer holders are preparing to take profits or dump the cryptocurrency, suggesting minimum selling pressure in the near future, as CoinDesk reported previously.      As bitcoin’s inflow to exchanges continues to decrease, it also suggests that price volatility, which has remained high, is mostly driven by “speculative demand” rather than any fundamental factors, Philip Gradwell, chief economist at blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, wrote in his newsletter on March 19.      At press time, the oldest cryptocurrency is changing hands at $55,772.02, according to CoinDesk 20 data, down 2.98% in the past 24 hours. The sudden price drop to as low as $55,685.09 in the past few hours came after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell Jerome Powell said cryptocurrencies are ""not really useful stores of value"" during a virtual panel discussion on digital banking hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.      Andreotti also argued the frenzy in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has caused a huge distraction, especially given the heavy media coverage.      “The focus has shifted almost entirely on NFTs.” he said. “That’s where all the attention is at the moment.”      Read More: Jack Dorsey’s First Tweet Sells for $2.9M    Ether moves with bitcoin; NFT, DeFi demand continues to grow    Ether (ETH) was down on Monday, trading around $1,744.03 and slipping 2.85% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The ether-to-bitcoin price ratio, currently at around 0.03, within the rough 0.02-0.04 range since late 2018, suggests ether is still largely tied with bitcoin’s price performance.      Some, however, think ether’s price will soon benefit from the rapid growth in NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi), if it hasn't already.      Compared with bitcoin, “ether seems to be solidifying itself as the bellwether on smart contract activity and is subject to more diverse narratives, like demand for DeFi [and] NFTs,” said Stefan Coolican, chief financial officer of investment firm Ether Capital. “It could be that ether is taking a bitcoin-like role with respect to other smart contract platform tokens and has decoupled from bitcoin in the sense of being an ‘alt’ to bitcoin.”      Read more: ‘Altcoin Season’ Leaves Some Bitcoin Alternatives Frozen      Coolican suggested the elevated gas prices on Ethereum (gas is the cost for miners to execute transactions) is the main reason the white-hot NFT and DeFi sectors, which both are largely based on Ethereum blockchain, have not boosted ether’s price.      The total value locked in DeFi currently stands at $43.6 billion, according to DeFi Pulse. The amount has more than doubled from the beginning of the year. NBA Top Shot, the biggest marketplace for NFTs trading, saw its trading volume double in the past 30 days, data from DappRadar shows.      It is “really tough to pinpoint one factor on Ethereum since there is so much going on,” Coolican added.    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in red Monday.

42434019,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7CZh,1616443245,Non-Fungible Tokens and the New Patronage Economy,"The non-fungible tokens for art and culture that have been making waves in recent weeks are economic peculiarities. They offer ownership – cryptographic, certain, secure ownership – but none of the exclusive rights we usually associate with ownership. You can freely stare at my two miserable CryptoKitties as easily as I can explore Beeple’s $69 million “EVERYDAYS.”      There’s an obvious question here: What are people actually buying when they buy an NFT? The slightly counterintuitive answer suggests that what we’re seeing with NFTs is the emergence of a new type of cultural economy built around one of the oldest forms of cultural production: patronage.    Chris Berg is co-director of the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub in Melbourne, Australia.    Let’s begin with the theory of property rights. Economists tend to talk about property rights as not a single thing but a bundle of distinct rights governed by law, contract and even custom.      For example, you can own something without possessing it. You can possess something without having the right to transfer it. You can control something without having the right to exclude others from enjoying it.      Property rights are highly divisible. I can write a contract to transfer my property to you but at the same time specify that I retain physical access or a revenue stream. Resale royalty frameworks for art are a tangible instance of building the idea of these divisible rights into law.      See also: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?      To buy an NFT of a piece of art is to own something without having the means of excluding others from enjoying it – or at least enjoying looking at it, watching it or listening to it. The pleasure a buyer gets from owning something is the experience of ownership itself. How much is that experience worth? The wild prices we’re seeing in NFTs right now is the process of price discovery for the value of this pure ownership.      Ownership-as-consumption only sounds weird if you don’t think about it for very long. There’s a long tradition in the art world of owning art and lending it to a museum – appropriately acknowledged – for the public to enjoy. Some of the world’s private collections of art are held in free port storage facilities where they are seen rarely if at all.      To be fair, high-cost ownership-as-consumption is a niche pastime. But here’s where NFTs are potentially very interesting: They don’t have to be more than niche to have a big impact on the economics of art.      An artist who receives one payment from a wealthy NFT investor is no worse off than an artist who receives a large number of smaller payments from cultural consumers. In fact, they’re probably better off. The NFT-funded artist can continue to work in the open cultural space to gain fans, sell tickets, market merchandise or just get his or her art out to as wide a public as possible.    This is a lot like the traditional patronage model of art funding. But it’s much better.    This is why one of the main criticisms from the cultural community – that NFTs look like a step towards a digital rights management dystopia, a creation of walled gardens that narrows who can access cultural artifacts – is so off the mark. NFTs allow us to financialize culture, but at the same time leave it open access for anyone to view, watch or listen to.      This is a lot like the traditional patronage model of art funding. But it’s much better.      Historically, patronage involved wealthy patrons directly supporting individual artists. As Tyler Cowen points out in his ""In Praise of Commercial Culture,"" patronage funding meant the artist’s fortunes were hostage to patrons’ whims. Artists had to flatter and pander to the tastes of a narrow elite few. And while some patrons supported the construction of public monuments in their honor, a lot of patron-funded art was kept in private homes and behind locked doors.      NFTs offer the benefits of patronage without the well-understood costs. Wealthy individuals can continue to support art and enjoy the experience of ownership. Rather than relying on a small community of the rich in, say, Venice, digital artists can immediately reach a global supply of patrons. The ownership of art can be demonstrated (cryptographically proven, if really necessary) to all who the patron seeks to impress with her impeccable taste. But at the same time the art itself remains free for the public to enjoy. This looks like the old patronage economy but without the exclusion we normally associate with patronage.      See also: How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT      There’s some infrastructure missing to fully realize the vision outlined here. For instance, artists and platforms need to better empower conspicuous ownership. Owners need mechanisms and tools and even norms to display the art they have purchased to others that isn’t just a link to an OpenSea or Rarible page.      Cultures of sharing and frameworks of what constitutes legitimate sharing need to be developed. We need a widely accepted Creative Commons-style framework to establish standard practices and expectations around use and reuse.      But these will come. For now, the NFT standards that have suddenly launched into mainstream consciousness provide the basis of exciting innovation in the funding and production of culture.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Chris Berg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/22/non-fungible-tokens-and-the-new-patronage-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b8b2c79ef79d8cd3625371e178367c53873fab1-2000x792.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434015,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7CPh,1616438801,Can Decentralized Stablecoins Stabilize?,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) idealists want to create perfectly free financial ecosystems that can't be subverted by governments, corporations or regulators. They also want their decentralized nirvana to be equipped with stablecoins so users can be protected from price craziness.      Therein lies the contradiction.    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    Are decentralized anarchic systems, those that have no link to existing centralized institutions, capable of creating stability? Or are they too unanchored to generate the traction necessary for a stablecoin to be, well, stable?      A new wave of stablecoin architects thinks it's possible. They want to create money that is not only stable but also avoids relying on the authorities that underpin the dollar system.      Whether these new experiments work is another question.    USD coin domination    Before I describe what these new experiments are, let me show what problem they are trying to solve.      DeFi refers to a set of financial applications built on blockchains using smart contracts, unstoppable and transparent bits of computer code. The biggest DeFi community is on the Ethereum blockchain, but other competing blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain, Terra and Tron are also trying to nurture a DeFi ecosystem.      A stable money is important to people who participate in financial transactions. Volatile assets like bitcoin and ethereum don't cut it. The Ethereum DeFi ecosystem’s thirst for stability has led it to become hugely reliant on USD coin, a U.S. dollar stablecoin issued by the Centre Consortium, consisting of Coinbase and Circle.      J.P. Koning - Regulation Could Actually Help Tether      USD coins are rock solid, but only because they are backed by dollars held in Circle’s accounts at a regulated bank. That bank is, in turn, connected to what most DeFi “maximalists” would probably see as the triple-headed snake of centralization: the Federal Reserve, America's central bank; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which regulates and insures banks; and FinCEN, the U.S.'s anti-money laundering watchdog.      So, ironically, DeFi's success, which rests in part on its stable tokens, comes courtesy of good ol'-fashioned Wall Street database technology.      The decentralization idealists worry that Circle, the issuer of USD coin, might be required to freeze addresses at the behest of law enforcement. FinCEN may require it to carry out know your customer (KYC) checks, thus unveiling a huge swath of DeFi. None of this is compatible with a purely decentralized financial nirvana.      Which gets us to some of the solutions that are being proposed.    No-collateral or collateral-lite    The most radical stablecoin experiments are empty set dollar, dynamic set dollar and basis cash. This trio of stablecoins, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, tries to achieve decentralization by doing away with collateral.      Collateral refers to the ""backing"" assets that traditional money issuers have always relied on to ensure the stability of the money they issue.      In place of collateral, all three stablecoins deploy incentives that encourage stablecoins owners to refrain from selling whenever the stablecoin falls below $1. As more stray stablecoins are temporarily locked away, the supply of stablecoins gets reduced. In theory, this should push the stablecoin’s price back up to $1.    Their prices as of yesterday were $0.13, $0.16 and $0.28 respectively, far below their $1 target price.    No-collateral money is a breakthrough idea for decentralization maximalists. Collateral, especially when it is regulated, is one avenue by which a stablecoin can be ""subverted."" That's why basis cash, one of the no-collateral experiments, advertises itself as ""without regulatory risk.""      But there's a problem with empty set dollar, dynamic set dollar and basis cash. Their prices as of yesterday were $0.13, $0.16 and $0.28 respectively, far below their $1 target price. These experiments don’t seem to be working out.      One no-collateral stablecoin does appear to be functioning, however: terraUSD. Found on the Terra blockchain, terraUSD is currently ranked the fifth-largest stablecoin on CoinGecko.      Like empty set dollar and its close relatives, terraUSD's stability relies on incentives, not collateral. When terraUSD falls below $1, say to 98 cents, traders are given an opportunity to buy terraUSD and quickly convert them into $1 worth of newly created LUNA tokens, the Terra blockchain's governance token. And so traders earn a 2-cent profit. This has the effect of sucking up the excess supply of terraUSD and bringing it back to $1.      See also: J.P. Koning - What Happens if All Stablecoin Users Have to Be Identified?      Another stablecoin experiment, frax, has adopted a less radical collateral-lite framework. To maintain its $1 price, frax uses a similar incentive mechanism to terraUSD. But the frax protocol also holds a layer of collateral in reserve. The 110 million frax stablecoins currently in circulation are anchored by $96 million reserves, the remaining $14 million being unbacked.      Like terraUSD, frax has succeeded in maintaining a $1 price over the last few months.      So for decentralization maximalists who want stable money without collateral, it's a mixed bag. Experiments like empty set dollar have stalled. But others appear to be working, at least for now.    Black swans    No-collateral and collateral-lite stablecoins are often advertised as technological advances. If so, one wonders why traditional finance never evolved its own versions of no-collateral money, despite centuries of lead time.      One possibility is no-collateral money isn’t sustainable in the long term. The biggest threat to any stable asset is a ""black swan"" market disruption. People panic. There’s a run from riskier stable assets into less-risky ones. Pegs, once rock solid, melt away.      In response to these disruptions, a centuries-old blueprint for establishing stable money has evolved: over-collateralization. That is, if a bank issues $10,000 in fresh dollar IOUs to a home buyer, that $10,000 will be more than covered by the value of the borrower's house and downpayment.      Alternatively, if a bank lends to an investor and takes, say, Tesla shares as security, it will require $150 worth of Tesla for each dollar lent. The $50 is a ""haircut"" that the bank uses to protect itself.      As long as a banker is careful to apply appropriate haircuts, then when a panic hits and pressure builds on the bank’s $1 peg the bank can always sell this collateral and use the funds to support its peg.    [They] may not be able to weather a major black swan event, say like a market crash.    For instance, even if the value of Tesla collateral collapses from $150 to $100, the bank will still have enough “backing” to support the money it has issued.      The worry is that in dispensing with collateral as a line of defense (or using less of it), the new breed of less-than-fully collateralized stablecoins may not be able to weather a major black swan event, say like a market crash, an outbreak of war or a new pandemic.      It’s possible that less-than-fully collateralized stablecoins will prove to be an enduring advance in financial technology. If so, they’ll imbue DeFi with true stability while simultaneously disconnecting it from the incumbent financial system.      Or they could be highly risky assets that offer only the illusion of safety. We'll know which it is when the next big market disruption hits.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/22/can-decentralized-stablecoins-stabilize,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9ba48206f6e2aba287a392c2d759a01f35f32e1-1420x784.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That’s according to Jiang Zhuoer, CEO of BTC.Top, one of the largest cryptocurrency mining platforms based in China.      “BTC could tip between this September and next June, targeting $150,000-$300,000,” Jiang told CoinDesk in comments sent via WeChat by a representative. “The current price level is definitely not reaching a peak,” he said. “The attention and popularity around bitcoin has not reached the level we saw in the past bull market.”      Jiang also explained his rationale with crypto-journalist WuBlockchain, in a Twitter thread published over the weekend.    “After Tesla purchased $1.5 billion in BTC and Meitu purchased $90 million in BTC and ETH, there are no other large, listed companies in North America and Asia to follow up,” according to WuBlockchain’s interview with Jiang.  Jiang also pointed to a potential shift in U.S. monetary policy as a headwind for cryptocurrencies. The global economic recovery could lead to a policy tightening, which could weigh on risk assets including bitcoin.  Jiang is not alone in his bitcoin forecast. “Previously, several Chinese blockchain company CEOs told WuBlockchain that they believe this autumn might start to turn into a bear,” tweeted WuBlockchain.

42406152,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAes1Ge,1616436086,Bitcoin's Price Volatility Expectations Slip to Lowest in 3 Months,"Bitcoin might be diminishing in a quality that's long been a sore spot for criticism: volatility. One critical gauge shows the cryptocurrency's expected price swings are now at their lowest point in three months.      The cryptocurrency's implied volatility, or expectations for price turbulence, declined to an annualized 75% early Monday, based on calculations using options premiums with a one-month horizon. That's the lowest since Dec. 25, according to data provider Skew. They peaked above 145% in mid-January.      ""The declining trend suggests that markets are expecting sideways price action,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at trading sentiment data provider Trade the Chain, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Bitcoin is currently stuck in a narrowing price range, with both bulls and the bears unwilling to lead, as seen below.      Vinokourov expects a ""pickup in downside protection flow,"" given the lack of clear visible upside.      In plain English, traders could buy put options amid signs of bull fatigue. A put option is a derivative contract that gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.      At press time, one-, three-, and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls, are at negative values, indicating greater demand for call options or bullish bets.      Also read: This Ether Options Play by Institutions Has Lottery Ticket Potential      The market bias for calls would strengthen if the cryptocurrency breaks out of the narrowing price range with strong spot market volumes, opening the doors for substantial gains above $60,000. On the flip side, a range breakdown may invite stronger chart-driven selling pressure, leading a deeper pullback. According to one analyst, the cryptocurrency could drop to $47,000 if the support at $55,000 is breached.      A prolonged period of below-average volatility often paves the way for violent price action on either side. However, that's not the case right now. While the implied volatility has come off sharply from its January highs, it's still hovering near its lifetime average.

42406143,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAes17n,1616435523,The Node: NFTs Made It to ‘Then They Mock You’ Even Faster Than Bitcoin Did,"My all-time favorite movie review came out in 2012 when The New Yorker tasked Anthony Lane with covering “The Amazing Spider-Man” and “Take This Waltz.” Really, I just like the end of the first paragraph, which makes a distinctly New Yorkerly objection to the first film. Lane wrote:      ""Marvel Comics could at least have taken the opportunity to elide the intensely annoying hyphen in the title. Or does merely suggesting such a change make me a total ass-hole?""    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    As if The New Yorkershould talk about punctuation ... but, no, stop – I mustn't digress. See, I have this theory about the truly rarefied publishing organs. I believe in every one there's a few irascible editors around who understand that it is their publication's job, its role in the very order of the society that trusts it, to studiously hate new and strange phenomena.      In particular, they must hate that which has any hint of having ""bubbled up"" into public consciousness, while providing a bit more latitude for that which has ""trickled down.""      In my head, Lane had a conversation something like this with his assigning editor:    ""Hey, Anthony, can you pick up this new thing with Seth Rogen and Sarah Silverman? ‘The Lousy Waltz’ or something?""""Yeah sure.""""Oh and the new Spider-Man?""""You bet.""""Listen, on the Spider-Man...?""""Yeah?""""You hate it.""""OK.""""You can hate it for whatever reason you want, but you hate it.""""Sure thing, Chief.""    Something like that. This is almost certainly not like anything that happened except for, perhaps, within their hearts.      So, it is in this spirit that I entered into Jason Farago's critic's notebook entry in the comparably venerable The New York Times: ""Beeple has won. Here's what we've lost,"" which grapples with the sale of 5,000 artworks in one non-fungible token at Christie's for $69 million in ETH.      I confess, I began reading this skeptical that anything's been lost simply because one guy managed to get paid for a kind of output that previously folks have had a hard time getting paid for. But, ok, let's go through what Farago has to say.      He opens with a little Andy Warhol and does some explaining about crypto. Then he puts the Beeple sale into a kind of historical/cultural context. I think this part might be on point ... but really, I don't have any clue what he is saying:    ""Today’s new money prefers its own systems of both finance and culture, where cryptocurrency’s anarcho-libertarianism dovetails with certain boys’ amusements: the subliterate comedy of Salt Bae and Boaty McBoatface, the penny-ante heroism of online role-playing games, and the stunted emotions of streaming porn.""    Next, he offers a quick history of prior artistic commentary on ownership and commerce before the obligatory parenthetical on Ethereum's environmental impact (Did you know that every time an NFT gets made a family of sea turtles must be blendered into smoothies for expat Italian nobility? There was a Medium post on it.)      Finally, he gets into his criticism. And of course that's fine. Criticism is its own kind of art.      I don't want to argue about whether Beeple's work is or isn't good or about just how Farago dismisses it. I want to make a different point, the point I was hinting at in my imagined vignette about The New Yorker and its review of “The Amazing Spider-Man.”      It doesn't matter what these pieces actually say about the new thing that is dismissed; that's not the work these essays are doing.      These are about instructing the in-group about what they should care about and what they definitely should not (that is, the out-group's leavings). New things, after all, can be confusing, now more than ever.      These works are a sort of service journalism. It needs to be easy enough to say, ""Well, I read about that in the Times and it sounded ridiculous"" and that's the end of it. That's the actual point. No one needs to remember what was said; the permission to ignore it just needs to be printed somewhere estimable.      Upon rereading the Farago passage quoted above, I do understand it. It only takes two words to do so: ""new money.""      Do cinematic treatments of comic books mean the form has crossed over – like 18th century novels – from a mere mass market diversion to a form worthy of the more refined? No, not yet? Oh, good.      And does the fact that an auction house like Christie's sold one of these pieces mean the artistically interested need to actually – you know – be seen taking an interest? No? What a relief. Who has the time?      But you know what they say: ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you and then you have a contentious chain split and weirdly the total value across both blockchains only goes up because nothing makes sense on the internet. So it goes.""      I am going to make a prediction: One day, estimable people will be expected to have estimable opinions on the works of crypto artists (or at least to parrot someone else's, probably published in the Times), just as they do about painting and ballet and esoteric film (none of which are going anywhere).      But not yet, Connecticut crowd! Never fear, Park Avenue. The Times has given you a pass on NFTs. You don't need to worry about them quite yet.      It's ok if the smart set takes a pass on the blockchain's artworks. I'm taking a pass on “The Crown.” Both will be fine.

He's been given credit for correctly predicting bitcoin's steep price correction in 2018.      In an interview on CoinDesk TV, Brandt, a well-known author on interpreting chart patterns, explained the long-term BTC bull market remains intact. His technical analysis suggests BTC could continue to rally, albeit with corrections along the way.    Brandt expects bitcoin to reach $180,000 to $200,000 by Q3 or Q4 based on its long-term trend channel.  ""I keep my eye on the broader picture. Bitcoin over the past 10 to 11 years, you get these big rallies that accelerate two to three years, and then you get a big correction,"" said Brandt.  Bitcoin is currently moving along its fourth parabolic advance on the weekly log-scale chart.  The parabolic advance provides an anchor to BTC price from the March 2020 low.  However, Brandt cautioned against the recent wave of exuberance on social media. ""We're in for trouble,"" Brandt said, when people start ""having laser-eyes on their Twitter feed.""

The volcanos, situated in Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Indonesia and Mexico, were selected based on ""the significant humanitarian threat they represent, with at least 700,000 individuals living within 60 miles (100 km) radius of a potential eruption,"" reports the Intelligent Insurer.  The charity worked with blockchain technology from Replexus, insurance firm Howden Group and risk management platform Mitiga Solutions to launch the bond, offering investors high yields that would not pay out if a catastrophe occurs, said the publications.  “Our model can anticipate the trajectory of the volcanic ash cloud using prevailing winds to better estimate the impact and more effectively guide CAT bond proceeds,"" said Alejandro Marti, CEO and co-founder of Mitiga Solutions.  By using the private blockchain developed by Replexus the charity will reduce costs by $200,000-$400,000 per issue compared to using a traditional settlement system.

42410985,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggu7Bk,1616429300,'Altcoin Season' Leaves Some Bitcoin Alternatives Frozen,"Is it altcoin season? This week, Grayscale Investments announced a slew of new trusts, each focused on smaller-cap ""altcoins."" (CoinDesk and Grayscale are both owned by Digital Currency Group.) Meanwhile, Ethereum's native currency, ether, is outpacing bitcoin so far this year, rising 142% as of Thursday. A dozen other assets on the CoinDesk 20 – our list of the assets that matter the most to the market – are also ahead of bitcoin, led by Web 3.0 assets cardano and algorand and DeFi asset 0x.  ""Altcoin season,"" or ""alt season,"" is a meme for the idea that bitcoin returns move cyclically against other crypto assets, or ""altcoins,"" as in, alternatives to bitcoin. The notion is that investors take their bitcoin profits and play the altcoin casino with house money, and vice versa.  There's evidence to support that theory, at least anecdotally. In the fourth quarter of 2020, for example, bitcoin outran everything in the Digital Large Cap Index (DLCX), an index that represents 70% of the crypto markets’ value. The DLCX is replicable for U.S. institutional investors, and it’s updated every second by CoinDesk's subsidiary company, TradeBlock.  In the chart you can see that only litecoin, which had an extraordinary run in the fourth quarter, managed to keep pace with bitcoin.  Read more: Multiple Tokens See Rally Amid Looming ‘Alt Season’  Contrast that with 2021 for the year to date: Returns from litecoin and bitcoin cash have lagged, while ether has outpaced bitcoin by a significant margin. (The asset XRP, another long-time large-cap crypto, isn't on this chart because it was excluded from the DLCX early in the first quarter after several exchanges dropped the Ripple-linked crypto, following a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.)  So is it altcoin season? Two of the three largest ""alts"" are underperforming bitcoin. At the same time, historically smaller alts are outperforming. The chart below shows CoinDesk 20 returns year to date, as of March 16. The CoinDesk 20 comprises the largest 20 digital assets by volume, measured over two consecutive quarters on a list of trusted exchanges. As the chart shows, 13 out of the 20 assets on the list are showing better returns than bitcoin, so far in 2021. (Stablecoins, also included in the CoinDesk 20 in order to track their market impact, are excluded from this chart.)  At the top of the chart, the leaders for 2021 year to date are cardano, 0x and algorand. The cardano and algorand assets are connected to smart contract platforms that rival Ethereum. The 0x token is a token built using Ethereum's ERC-20 standard, connected to a decentralized exchange. The 0x exchange is part of the decentralized finance, or DeFi, category, built mostly on Ethereum.  Read more: Chainlink Hits Record High, Altcoins Rally Amid Bitcoin Consolidation  What's happening isn't necessarily a cyclical shift in momentum between bitcoin and alts but a changing of the guard among alts. In this market, the laggards are currencies – competitors or complements to bitcoin. The leaders are smart contract platforms – competitors or complements to ether.  What comes next: pendulum swing or new paradigm?  Looking through the lens of programmatic indexes and lists such as the DLCX and the CoinDesk 20 makes it easier to identify patterns in a turbulent market. How to interpret the pattern is another matter. I see two possibilities:  1) Investor enthusiasm for ""digital gold"" or ""digital cash"" is consolidating behind bitcoin. The Bitcoin Core developers have won confidence with a conservative approach that has shown movement, evidenced by the Taproot proposal. Projects that gained attention as faster moving or varied flavors of Bitcoin will continue to lose relevance.  2) New investors are entering crypto. They are used to thinking in terms of potential cash flows and they prefer an investment that involves a product or a service. The need for decentralized applications has yet to prove itself beyond speculative uses but it is a narrative technology investors can understand.

Ransomware gang “REvil” is said to be demanding $50 million in the privacy coin monero to decrypt Acer computers, according to a Tech Radar report Monday.  Sleuthing by an intelligence analyst from Malwarebytes and cyber news site The Record is said to have uncovered a REvil portal with details of the demands.  The attack, not yet confirmed by Acer, is said to have locked up the firm's back-office network, but not its production systems, per the report.  In screenshots posted on the portal, REvil called the Acer representative they were communicating with an “incompetent negotiator,” asking for their superiors to be brought into the negotiations.  The gang has reportedly set a deadline of March 28 for its demands to be met.  Monero is a privacy-focused coin that is designed to be more difficult to trace than other cryptocurrencies. It has recently been delisted by multiple exchanges because of its opaqueness and association with dark web activities.  Acer is the world's fifth-largest computer maker, with almost 6% of global PC sales in Q4 2020, according to the latest Gartner data.

42406144,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAes19l,1616427216,Bad Sandwich: DeFi Trader 'Poisons' Front-Running Miners for $250K Profit,"Front-running Ethereum miners are suffering from a bout of food poisoning.      Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) – the practice of manipulating a transaction queue to squeeze profits from other unsuspecting traders – is making a hot splash in Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) markets. But players in the know aren't always as safe as they might think, as evidenced by one trader who netted 130 ETH, worth an estimated $250,000, by preying on the predators.      Friday, bot trader and LocalCoin Swap CTO Nathan Worsley released two token contracts named “Salmonella” and “Listeria” on the Ethereum blockchain with the intention of luring unsuspecting bot traders into an ambush. Mining pool Ethermine – which only publicly announced its MEV strategy last Wednesday – became entangled in the token trap, netting Worsley a quarter-million dollars after a few hours’ work.      Ethermine, Worsley and other MEV trailers are playing the blockchain equivalent of high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies that recently came into the public spotlight with the Robinhood, r/WallStreetBets and Melvin Capital spectacle.    Read more: Ethermine Adds Front-Running Software to Help Miners Offset EIP 1559 Revenue Losses    Trades on decentralized exchanges (DEX) are sitting ducks while they remain idle in the processing queue. A small cohort of developers can and do take advantage of this lag time between hitting the trade button and the trade executing on-chain by front-running, back-running or, in this case, “sandwiching” a transaction.      Worsley’s gambit was a “poisoned” sandwich trade. In a sandwich, a transaction is both front-run and back-run (the bread), which causes price slippage for the transaction in between (the meat, or perhaps cheese).      “In layman's terms, you see that someone will buy an asset, so you buy it first to artificially inflate the price, before selling afterwards at a profit,” Worsely explained in a post mortem.    A ‘poisoned’ sandwich for front-running bots    Nimble solo bot traders can take advantage of large players moving into the market. One method Worsley developed was poisoning a sandwich trade.      Worsley deployed a proprietary token contract with tweaked parameters, including notifications if anyone was trying to trade with the toxic contract. Additionally, the contract would return only 10% of the asked-for tokens in the Uniswap pool Worsely setup.      “It has some special logic to detect when anyone other than the specified owner is transacting it, and in these situations it only returns 10% of the specified amount – despite emitting event logs which match a trade of the full amount,” he said.    Read more: New Research Sheds Light on the Front-Running Bots in Ethereum’s Dark Forest    Worsley then sent out transactions with a both a low transaction fee and high slippage. Ethermine’s bots raced ahead to take advantage of the slippage as Worsley's bait lingered in the transaction queue.      “Instead of giving them a juicy payout, the token itself in the trade exploits the sandwich trader by giving them only a fraction of the tokens they thought the swap would yield,” Worsley explained. “After this happens, the ‘sell’ order of the sandwich trader now fails and they are left holding the Salmonella token. Instead of making a bunch of ETH in profit from my bait, they are instead left with a stomach full of Salmonella.”      Worsley remains unapologetic about his MEV strategy, telling CoinDesk DeFi is merely a game of poker.      “Nothing against Ethermine or the other traders personally, but this is a game of high-stakes poker and they sat down at the table intending to take all of my chips. Maybe next time they will be the ones walking home with all my chips. That's the game,” he said.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/22/bad-sandwich-defi-trader-poisons-front-running-miners-for-250k-profit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1a08837c06c7b4fd1ef0cf4d9e415878e87e636-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Backed by Binance, Google Launchpad and more, Xend Finance is a decentralized credit union protocol designed to ""optimize"" and ""add value to the core operations"" of credit unions, according to a company white paper.      It's also the first DeFi protocol to launch from the African continent using the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) platform, aiming to make financial markets more accessible to underserved communities, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk on Monday.      See also: What Is DeFi?      “The problem for the citizens of many countries in Africa is that their currency valuations fluctuate wildly, often devaluing greatly compared to other regions,” said CEO Ugochukwu Aronu. “Through our platform and Binance Smart Chain, people can channel their savings into stable currencies, without worry that their money will devalue overnight.""      The platform allows users to earn annual percentage yields from savings held in personal or credit union accounts created by the protocol. Interest can be earned by converting cryptocurrency or fiat currency to stablecoins for staking – a way to participate in transaction validation on a ""proof-of-stake"" network by committing assets for a period of time.

42406155,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAes1Hd,1616422256,Russia's Darknet Criminals Have Novel Crypto Cash-Out System: 'Buried Treasure',"Cybercriminals in Russia are going to extreme lengths to untraceably cash out cryptocurrency: The word used in online ads is “клад,” literally “buried treasure.”      Cashing out crypto on Hydra, the sprawling Russian darknet marketplace, has evolved to include services that offer to hide large volumes of physical cash at a specified location, where the cash can be retrieved by the customer.      Ransomware, darknet markets and exchange thefts generate large volumes of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The criminals behind this activity, however, face a challenge in terms of how to remove any link to identity when turning the proceeds into cash. Darknet users that are proficient in laundering crypto are willing to provide fiat off-ramps for a fee, according to new research from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.      Russia’s illicit treasure hunts are not an entirely novel idea. The physical exchange of rubles for crypto using a GPS location is adapted from Hydra’s very sophisticated drug selling and delivery methods, which work like a secret gig economy based on reputation, courier vetting, potency testing and so on.      Hydra’s army of illicit sellers and buyers sometimes handle a bitcoin payment by topping up a prepaid debit card, or sending rubles to an online wallet service or bank account.      But burying cash is increasingly seen as a fail-safe fiat off-ramp for criminals looking to avoid the long arm of cybercops (and analytics firms like Elliptic working on their behalf).      “It’s an interesting way of cashing out that people are starting to use,” Elliptic CEO Tom Robinson said in an interview. “It’s difficult to do at scale and requires that you are in Russia, but that’s where a lot of Hydra users are based.”    Outrunning AML    In the early days, when many crypto exchanges were not checking the provenance of customers closely and blockchain analytics tools were in their infancy, cashing in cryptocurrency proceeds of crime was less of a challenge.      The situation today, involving global anti-money laundering (AML) regulators armed with blockchain sleuthing tools to trace and screen transactions is dramatically different, said Robinson.      The darknet listing above advertises a service where, in return for a cryptocurrency payment, the vendor will bury vacuum-packed (all drugs and cash are vacuum packed to prevent dogs sniffing them out) physical cash “5-20 cm under the ground.”      The service is costly, with fees of around 7% of the amount being exchanged, according to Elliptic. There are also other risks because thieves known as “seekers” sometimes trail the treasure men and steal the deliveries.      Hydra is by far the biggest darknet marketplace to have ever existed, with about $125 million worth of transactions per week. (At its peak, Alphabay, the nearest rival, clocked between $50 million and $60 million per week.)    Read more: Darknet’s JokerStash Retiring After Making Over $1B Through Illicit Transactions    “I’m surprised Hydra hasn't had more coverage because it's absolutely huge,” Robinson said. “I think it's probably because it's Russian language that people don't really think about it as much as that Western problem.”      Russian darknet markets are all about innovation, said Patrick Shortis, an expert on such marketplaces from the University of Manchester, citing the continually updated rule book known as the Kladman’s (Treasure man’s) Bible.      “Russian dark markets differ from their Western counterparts in that the postal service in Russia is not as reliable, and so the dead-drop method is preferred,” Shortis said in an interview. “Also, in the West we care a lot about using PGP (pretty good privacy) and cleaning our coins and using monero and whatnot.

42406150,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAes1Eg,1616418000,"Crypto Is Banned in Morocco, but Bitcoin Purchases Are Soaring","Cryptocurrencies are banned in Morocco, but peer-to-peer bitcoin trading platform LocalBitcoins is reporting all-time trading highs this year.      February 2021 was the platform’s “best month ever” in Morocco in terms of trading volumes, according to LocalBitcoins Chief Marketing Officer Jukka Blomberg, who said approximately $900,000 worth of bitcoin was traded on the platform through the month. LocalBitcoins also saw a 30% increase in user registrations between 2019 and 2020, with over 700 new accounts created, Blomberg said.      Bitcoin purchases are rising despite a ban on cryptocurrencies in the North African country. In November 2017, Morocco’s Foreign Exchange Office informed the general public that virtual currency transactions were an infringement on foreign exchange regulations and subject to sanctions and fines. Financial regulators continue to view cryptocurrencies with skepticism, even as the country’s central bank investigates the benefits of a government-issued national digital currency (CBDC).      Despite the ban, trading on peer-to-peer platforms like LocalBitcoins rose steadily through the years. From November 2017 to February 2021, trading volumes on the platform saw a steep 215% increase.      The 2020 bitcoin price run drove the demand for the cryptocurrency around the world. In Morocco, a combination of curiosity and a desire for financial autonomy is driving Moroccans to buy crypto, according to Insaf Nori, Middle East community manager at cryptocurrency firm Decred.      “Some traders just want the quick gain from cryptocurrencies. Some of them want financial freedom because they don’t use banks,” Nori, who is based in Casablanca, told CoinDesk.    Unbanked    Morocco is one of the most underbanked countries in the world. World Bank research from 2019 indicates only 29% of Moroccan adults have access to bank accounts, which is considerably lower than the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regional average of 44%.      “I think that it's just employed people who use the banks. If they are unemployed or self-employed, they just want to stock their money at their home. They just don’t use the bank,” Nori said.      In a 2015 article that appeared in the Guardian, a Moroccan banking official Ismail Douiri described the reaction of low-income earners to a low-cost financial services program that was created with them in mind. Most were intimidated by the banks, and as well as by fees.      “These were all concerns we could have foreseen. What we didn’t expect was for our prospective new customers to say what they valued most was privacy and confidentiality,” Douiri wrote.      Douiri went on to explain how households did not want their neighbors to know they had a bank account because they may try to borrow money.      Nori said the freedom and confidentiality inherent in cryptocurrencies could be feeding local curiosity in bitcoin.    Signs of Change    According to Nori, Moroccans couldn't buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies through digital asset exchanges using their credit cards. If they wanted crypto, they had to buy it in Europe or the U.S., Nori said.      Although Moroccans were not allowed to directly purchase cryptocurrencies using their bank accounts, peer-to-peer lending facilitated cash for crypto trading. Payment options on LocalBitcoins indicate the use of cash deposits and transfers to make bitcoin trades made via social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram.      But in April 2020, global cryptocurrency exchange Binance added support for purchasing crypto with Moroccan dirham. Moroccans can buy crypto from certain exchanges using international credit cards, although they are not allowed to convert their purchases back into dirham, according to Nori.      “So that's a big step,” Nori said, adding that she believes being able to buy crypto on traditional exchanges from Morocco is a sign local regulators could make cryptocurrencies legal in the future.      “Overall, it seems like bitcoin’s positive trend and growing demand is untouched in Morocco. And looking towards 2021 and beyond there are numerous reasons to be very optimistic about the growth potential,” Blomberg added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | BNB,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/22/crypto-is-banned-in-morocco-but-bitcoin-purchases-are-soaring,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfcbd0651be839bf89c7909400fb04ab6450b7fb-2560x1631.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406151,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAes1Ff,1616415746,"Bitcoin Searches Spike in Turkey as Central Bank Chief Fired, Lira Plummets","Bitcoin-related Internet searches are jumping in Turkey after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's ouster of the nation's top central banker sent the local currency, the lira, plunging in foreign-exchange markets.      The Google search value for the term ""Bitcoin"" more than quadrupled to 100 on Sunday after Erdoğan dismissed central bank governor Naci Agbal, triggering fears of a sharp slide in the lira (TRY).      The lira plunged at least partly on concerns the new top central banker might implement capital controls as a way of tamping down the nation’s high inflation rate. Such a move would represent an alternative to implementing rate hikes, which are known to preserve the fiat currency's value.      It’s possible some Turks see bitcoin as a way to deal with any potential capital controls or as a store of value if inflation accelerates or if the currency's value falls further against global counterparts.      At press time, Google Trends, a barometer for gauging general or retail interest in trending topics, was returning a value of 41 on ""Bitcoin"" – still significantly higher than the levels seen last week. Meanwhile, search values for gold remain flat in Turkey in the wake of the latest financial upheaval.      Google Trends provides access to a mostly unfiltered sample of actual search requests made on Google and scales searches on a range of 0 to 100, according to the company. A score of 100 indicates it is the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time frame.      Agbal raised interest rates by 200 basis points last week and has been widely credited for bringing stability to the lira's exchange rate during his four-month tenure, as Bloomberg noted. As such, his dismissal has pushed the lira lower.      The lira hit a 4.5-month low of 8.28 per U.S. dollar early Monday and was last seen changing hands near 7.92 per U.S. dollar, representing a 10% drop on the day, according to data source TradingView.      Arresting the sell-off may be challenging because the new central bank head, Sahap Kavcioglu, isn't a fan of rate hikes as a way of curbing inflation or exchange rate slide, according to Bloomberg. Also, Erdogan appears to believe interest rate hikes cause inflation rather than control it.      It remains to be seen if there is a sustained decline in the lira and a rise in hedging demand for bitcoin. Some observers maintain that an impending currency crisis would accelerate the adoption of bitcoin in Turkey. The activity on local exchanges has picked up in the past 24 hours or so.

42406138,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAes0zv,1616413570,"Hearing in SEC Case Positive for Ripple, XRP, Says Lawyer","A lawyer has described as ""bombshells"" comments made by the magistrate judge in the ongoing lawsuit between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and blockchain payments tech provider Ripple.      In a YouTube video published Saturday, attorney Jeremy Hogan, who is not involved in the case, said Judge Sarah Netburn of the Southern District Court in New York interrupted the discussion to apparently suggest the XRP cryptocurrency is more like a currency than a security.      “My understanding about XRP is that not only does it have a currency value but it has a utility, and that utility distinguishes it from bitcoin and ether,"" the judge said, according to Hogan.      This matter is at the heart of the SEC's case against Ripple because the regulator claims XRP had been sold by the company and its executives without either being registered as a security or the firm seeking an exemption.      ""No matter what the SEC may try and argue, a currency and a security are, by definition, in opposite ... These are two different things,"" Hogan said. He added the judge offering the view that XRP has utility is ""exactly what Ripple wants the court to be thinking.""      Netburn's comments came during a virtual hearing, observed by Hogan, over the SEC's attempt to obtain personal financial information from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen.      The second ""bombshell,"" said Hogan, came as Netburn questioned whether ""everyone who sold XRP – including you and me – are selling illegal securities"" based on the SEC's prior argument. The SEC attorney responded by saying that, under Section 4 of the Securities Act, only Ripple and its affiliates (meaning employees, Hogan said) could be accused of illegal sales.      This being the case, exchanges that have stopped selling XRP since the SEC action could now potentially relist it, according to Hogan, who stressed he wasn't offering legal advice.      However, Park Bramhall, senior counsel at Lowenstein Sandler LLP, takes a different view. ""The fact that the SEC has apparently stated that parties other than Ripple and its affiliates can resell XRP under Section 4 of the Securities Act doesn't mean that exchanges are free to relist XRP,"" he said.      ""What the SEC appears to be saying here is that, in its view, parties other than Ripple and its affiliates can rely on the exemption from registration provided under Section 4(a)(1) of the Securities Act for resales of XRP, and that exemption is only relevant if XRP is deemed to be a security,"" he told CoinDesk.      See also: Ripple’s Chris Larsen Files Motion to Dismiss SEC Case Over XRP Sales      Netburn is not the primary judge in the case but she is assisting District Judge Analisa Torres with aspects of the case such as discovery and mediation.

The claim comes via a report Monday from local magazine Business Today, citing a source with knowledge of the matter, but cannot be verified.  Previously, India has attempted to block IP addresses of adult sites and some apps, according to Business Today, but with limited success due to the use of virtual private networks (VPN).  India's government has said it plans to introduce a bill in the current session of parliament that would ban “private cryptocurrencies,” though its scope is far from clear.  There have been mixed signals regarding the planned legislation, with one government official stating India would completely ban cryptocurrency use, and another suggesting that will not be the case.  Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs Nirmala Sitharaman said earlier this month, “From our side, we are very clear that we are not shutting all options. We will allow certain windows for people to do experiments on the blockchain, bitcoins or cryptocurrency.”  In February, Indian cryptocurrency exchanges launched the #IndiaWantsBitcoin campaign, an initiative to convince parliament to regulate cryptocurrencies rather than impose an outright ban.
