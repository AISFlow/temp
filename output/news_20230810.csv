15885020,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546691,1691708431,"Terra Classic (LUNC) Chances Of Revival Grow Slimmer, Here’s Why","Terra Classic (LUNC) has suffered persistent declines since the network’s collapse back in 2022. These declines have ranged from its price through to the network’s Total Value Locked (TVL). And even while development abounds among its community members to try to restore it to its past glory, the numbers point to a low possibility of recovery. Terra Classic TVL Falls To All-Time Low After Terra’s crash in 2022, the network lost a significant chunk of its TVL due to investors pulling out their funds as well as developers moving their decentralized applications and protocols to other networks. Over time, there seemed to be a stable trend but once again, the network has lost out against its better counterparts. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Next In Line For A Rally Following Shark And Whale Buying Spree Data from the on-chain tracker DeFiLlama shows that as of Thursday, the total Terra Classic (LUNC) TVL is sitting at $2.11 million. This is notable because this is the lowest that the network’s TVL has ever been. It is also a long way from the over $20 billion all-time high TVL of the Terra blockchain before its tragic collapse. LUNC TVL falls to new all-time low | Source: DeFiLlama The vast majority of its meager TVL is spread across just two DeFi protocols: Terraswap and Astroport Classic, with $1.07 million and $933,527 in TVL, respectively. The highest that Terra’s TVL has been in 2023 is $12 million back in April 2023. Terra’s TVL has now declined by over 83% from its 2023 peaks. In the same vein, DeFiLlama shows $0 decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes over the last week, meaning that trading activity on the network has grounded to a halt. The Road To Recovery For LUNC Over the last year, the Terra community has been consistent about trying to help the network recover. However, the kind of decline that the cryptocurrency suffered as a result of the crash is not easy and near impossible to recover from. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Could Reach $180,000 Next Cycle If This Happens Throwing in the fact that the network’s activities are almost non-existent, the chances of recovery have become even slimmer. But perhaps the biggest hindrance to its recovery is the fact that LUNC’s supply ballooned to over 6 trillion coins. Given this, even a surge to the $1 mark is out of reach for the token, unless there is a significant reduction in its supply. LUNC’s price continues to struggle at this time, trading at $0.00007746 at the time of writing. Its market cap is currently sitting at $450 million, making it the 80th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

15883740,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546776,1691705762,Bitcoin Futures Fakeout: The Price Divergence That Predicts A Phony,"This week, Bitcoin traders braced for a breakout as an important technical buy signal triggered and BTCUSD shot up over $30,000 temporarily. They came up short-handed, however, as the market took an immediate turn back down. Interestingly, the fakeout could have possibly been predicted by a divergence between two BTCUSD price charts. Why Price Patterns And Technical Signals Can Fail Price patterns are tough to trade in cryptocurrencies. Because so many eyes are on the same pattern meeting precise parameters, the market has a way of making people pay for acting on the obvious. For example, a rising wedge pattern is typically bearish, but could breakout to the upside. The same is true for technical signals that a large portion of traders are paying attention to, such as notable crossovers and changes in momentum. This is exactly the case recently with a bullish crossover of the daily BTCUSD Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Related Reading: Will Record Low Volatility Awaken A Behemoth Bitcoin Surge? 4,000% Signal Returns The MACD is a momentum indicator that gives a buy signal when the MACD line crosses the signal line from below. This signal not only has appeared in Bitcoin, but it confirmed on BTCUSD spot exchanges, so what gives? It was a phony signal from the “future.” Conflicting signals | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Spot Possible Divergences With Bitcoin Futures By “future” we mean BTC CME Futures, also known as Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin derivatives product, which institutions use to speculate on the underlying price of BTCUSD. The BTC CME Futures chart doesn’t always reflect spot BTCUSD charts 1:1. Any divergences between the two platforms, has historically led to fakeouts and phony breakouts. Part of the reason for this is due to the platform shutting down for a short period each day, and for the entire weekend starting at Friday afternoon. The result is a Bitcoin chart with more traditional market traits, such as gaps. The missing price data also changes the calculation of many technical indicators. For example, moving averages are in slightly different locations from chart to chart. Related Reading: Crypto Storm Brewing: Bitcoin Vortex Indicator Flashes Buy Alert This is precisely how the recent “fakeout” higher was able to be predicted with a degree of accuracy. This discrepancy and divergence leading to false signals is nothing new and has been happening for years. When BTC CME finally participates in the same signal, the expected results often then arrive. Is this a situation similar to Dow Theory, where the DJIA and DJTA must confirm one another for a trend to be valid? Or is there some more at play? Whatever the case may be, there’s enough historical evidence at this point to pay attention to any divergences between spot and CME Futures. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

SAND’s 24-hour trading volume at press time stands at $74.9 million, per CoinGecko.  60 million SAND tokens were transferred out of the multisig Sandbox Genesis smart contract one week ago, according to block explorer Etherscan, a sign that the unlock had already begun.  Metaverse platform Sandbox’s SAND token has slid this month ahead of its Monday unlock, set to release more than 16% of the circulating supply.  However, 60 million SAND tokens were transferred out of the multisig Sandbox Genesis smart contract one week ago, according to block explorer Etherscan, a sign the unlock had already begun. Sandbox Discord Ambassador, who goes by the screenname Uncle Grumpy said this was an effort to “not shock” the system.  Token unlocks, typically bearish for the price, inject previously frozen liquidity into the market with scheduled issuances, often to project insiders and investors. Monday’s unlock will see over 332 million SAND tokens (roughly $133 million) enter into the open market.  According to TokenUnlocks, 50% of the tokens will be allocated to the team and company reserve. Sandbox advisors will receive about $15 million worth of tokens, while the remaining rest will go toward those that participated in the strategic and seed sales of SAND. Each of these parties will be able to sell their positions for the first time.  SAND’s 24-hour trading volume at press time stands at $74.9 million, per CoinGecko.  SAND’s February unlock managed to buck the bearing trend but there was no sign that this month’s instance would do the same. The token has fallen 4% since August 1 and spent the last week around 40 cents. Last year’s August airdrop pushed the price down over 20% in six days after the unlock.  “Just because there are token unlocks, it doesn’t mean the tokens are immediately flooding the market,” said Uncle Grumpy in a Discord conversation. “A lot of the tokens from these unlocks are used for events and rewards.”",NEGATIVE,SAND,BUSINESS | MARKET | SAND | TRADING | AIRDROP,Sage D.

Victims are directed to counterfeit websites where, once their crypto wallets are linmked, funds are syphoned using malicious smart contracts. According to the FBI, stolen tokens are then laundered through multiple cryptocurrency mixers and exchanges, obfuscating their tracks. The Blockchain Capital breach echoes a similar incident from April involving the crypto exchange platform, KuCoin.

Victims are directed to counterfeit websites where, once their crypto wallets are linmked, funds are syphoned using malicious smart contracts. According to the FBI, stolen tokens are then laundered through multiple cryptocurrency mixers and exchanges, obfuscating their tracks. The Blockchain Capital breach echoes a similar incident from April involving the crypto exchange platform, KuCoin. Its social media account was compromised, leading to a fake giveaway scam resulting in a loss of over $22.6K in cryptocurrency. In response, KuCoin assured full compensation to the impacted customers and emphasized the continued security of assets on its platform. Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, CEO of Binance, a global cryptocurrency exchange, recently warned of the uptick in such phishing attacks and advised the community against using text message-based two-factor authentication. Instead, he recommended more secure methods like hardware devices. With the frequency and sophistication of these cyber-attacks on the rise, stakeholders within the cryptocurrency domain remain on high alert, reinforcing the necessity for enhanced digital security measures.

15881446,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546702,1691701202,Here’s Why This Analyst Foresees Hedera (HBAR) Breaking Into The Crypto Top 10,"Hedera popularly known as HBAR, has lately been drawing attention in the world of cryptocurrencies. An influencer from the crypto-sphere recently asserted that this digital currency is poised to cement its position among the top 10 in the industry. HBAR’s Position In The Upcoming Bull Market Classy Crypto, a crypto-focused YouTube channel, hosted a discussion where the anchoring influencer laid out his reasoning, foreseeing HBAR’s substantial ascent in the near future. According to the host of Classy Crypto, HBAR is not just positioned to rise but is also primed to become one of the biggest beneficiaries in the anticipated bull run. Related Reading: HBAR Token Scores Impressive Gains As Major Cryptos Nosedive The host noted that one factor driving this optimism is the forthcoming Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange Trust Funds (ETFs). As these ETFs come into play, they are expected to usher a wave of institutional investors into the crypto sphere. However, the influencer argues that the initial attraction toward giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum would eventually pivot. Investors, after their primary foray, would likely explore alternative digital assets. These alternatives, which the host referred to as “pseudo-centralized currencies” offering distinct use cases, especially those with tracking capabilities, would then become the focal point. Hedera, with its tracking features, according to the host, could potentially emerge as a leading contender in this narrative. Hedera Offerings And Market Dynamics Diving deeper into Hedera’s offerings, the Classy Crypto host highlighted the consensus service of the platform. The host emphasized that this plays a significant role in tracking and catering to rising global demand. Additionally, in the backdrop of an evolving global political scenario, solutions like Hedera’s are anticipated to gain traction, given their ability to address large-scale issues. The host noted: Hedera has a consensus that does a lot of tracking and it’s great for the environment which is an increasingly large issue in our world political scene. Furthermore, beyond these specifics, the influencer also shared a broader market perspective. He envisions a major market breakout before the culmination of 2023. This momentum is likely to carry forward into 2024, heralding a significant bull run. One pivotal point he made pertained to the Layer 2 blockchains prevalent in the market. A realization among investors that many of these platforms might not support sustainable transaction sizes could direct focus towards Hedera. Related Reading: Hedera (HBAR) Token Shines With 10% Weekly Gains When Market Suffers Downtrend Particularly, its attributes, including fixed gas fees and the avant-garde Hashgraph technology, might just provide the edge it needs, according to the host. Over the past 24 hours, HBAR has traded in the red, down by nearly 5%. The asset currently trades at a price of $0.058, at the time of writing.

The controversy arises from Spark Protocol's terms of service, which actively prevent users from accessing the platform via virtual private networks (VPNs). By limiting VPN access, it appears MakerDAO is attempting to restrict U.S. users from the platform, causing a ripple effect on global user rights and igniting concerns over privacy in the DeFi sector. The decision to restrict VPN access follows closely on the heels of Rune Christensen, MakerDAO's founder, announcing the potential for DAI stablecoin holders to earn up to 8% returns via the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) on Spark Protocol. The appeal of these high yields comes from a system adjustment: when DSR adoption is sparse, the rate increases to attract users. Despite only 9% of DAI holders currently participating in DSR, the platform's mechanism automatically optimizes rates based on user engagement. Despite these prospective states, behind this innovative yield mechanism lies a broader issue. The DeFi space, characterized by its decentralized ethos and user autonomy, is now confronting questions about the balance between regulatory compliance and individual privacy rights. Chris Blec, a DeFi analyst, voiced strong concerns over Spark Protocol's VPN restrictions. Blec's stance is that MakerDAO's decision could compromise global user privacy, potentially prioritizing profit motives over decentralized principles. This contention around user rights and access isn't isolated. Over the past year, DAI's market trajectory experienced turbulence. Its market cap plummeted by 43%, from $7B to $4B, after a destabilizing event in March when both DAI and USDC stablecoins momentarily dropped below their usual peg. Concerns arose about the solvency of USDC's banking partners, and since DAI's collateral heavily comprised USDC, both tokens suffered. MakerDAO's strategy, introducing high DSR yields through Spark Protocol, aims to bolster its position in the volatile stablecoin ecosystem. On the contrary, by blocking VPN access, MakerDAO has placed itself in the crosshairs of a larger debate around the intersection of regulatory compliance, decentralized operations, and user rights in the crypto domain. While it remains that there is a need to evaluate the implications of MakerDAO's recent decisions, the line between user privacy and platform governance is set to be a defining conversation in the industry's DeFi sector.

42409957,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcR6zz,1691700796,Bittrex Reaches Settlement With SEC; Agrees to Pay $24M Fine,"Crypto exchange Bittrex settled charges of offering U.S. investors access to unregistered securities on Thursday, agreeing to pay a $24 million fine within two months of filing a liquidation plan for the exchange.  The SEC sued Bittrex, which filed for bankruptcy in May, earlier this year, saying it simultaneously operated a securities exchange, broker and clearinghouse without registering as any of these things with the regulator.  The SEC has brought similar charges against fellow crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance.US. The SEC further alleged that Bittrex directed crypto issuers to delete public statements that could suggest their tokens might violate securities law.  According to Thursday's court filing, Bittrex will neither admit nor deny the allegations, and cannot make any public statement that might suggest the SEC didn't have a factual basis for its allegations. Of the total $24 million fine, $14.4 million consists of disgorgement, $4 million in prejudgment interest on that disgorgement and $5.6 million in civil money penalties.  Bittrex's bankrupt U.S. arm has until 90 days after its liquidation plan is effective to pay the SEC, though the regulator may seek court judgement if it hasn't paid its fees and penalties by March 1 of next year.  ""Defendants agree that, as to Bittrex, the terms of the settlement reflected in this Consent and in the Judgment are subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court in the Bankruptcy Case and shall be treated as an allowed, unsecured claim under the terms of any Plan filed by Bittrex in the Bankruptcy Case,"" the filing said.  ""Today’s settlement makes clear that you cannot escape liability by simply changing labels or altering descriptions because what matters is the economic realities of those offerings,"" SEC Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal said in a statement. ""I am grateful to the SEC staff for aggressively pursuing non-compliance in the crypto industry, resolving this matter, and bringing additional relief to harmed investors.""

France’s Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) announced it would introduce “enhanced” requirements for crypto firms as it prepared for the implementation of the EU’s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. Amendments to Align with MiCA The AMF has amended its registration requirements for digital asset service providers (DASPs) to better align with the EU’s upcoming regulatory framework. The regulator said its “enhanced” requirements will take effect on January 1, 2024. In its announcement, the AMF said the changes have two objectives: “to incorporate into the General Regulation and its policy the provisions applicable to DASPs subject to “enhanced” registration. This regime will become mandatory from January 1, 2024, for new players wishing to provide the four services subject to mandatory registration;” and “align the requirements for DASPs licence with those for European authorisation for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) under the MiCA Regulation, and allow a fast track procedure to be implemented towards CASP authorisation.” France already has a relatively comprehensive licensing regime for crypto firms and is implementing changes to its regulation to comply with MiCA which will take effect within the next 12 – 18 months.

15879698,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546685,1691697623,"Solana (SOL) Leads Gains Among Top Coins, Is $30 Milestone Possible?","The price of Solana (SOL) has fluctuated a lot in the past week, like many other cryptocurrencies in the market. SOL is currently trading above $24, gaining 8.01% in its price in the past 7 days with over $376 million in trading volume in the past 24 hours. The coin’s movement has now sparked speculation among investors about the imminent breach of the $30 resistance threshold. Factors That Could Influence SOL’s Price Solana has seen significant growth in terms of its total value locked (TVL). According to Data from Messari, Solana did better than other chains, with a 14% increase in the amount of funds locked in last month. Related Reading: Whale Purchases $10 Million stETH In The past Day, Here Are Possible Reasons Why Additionally, data from DeFi Llama shows that Solana is now the 9th biggest chain in terms of locked funds. It has around $320.07 million locked, a big jump from the $205.11 million it had at the start of the year. This surge in Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) could attract more people to buy SOL tokens. Importantly, with rising interest, the price of Solana’s tokens might increase due to higher demand. However, if there’s suddenly bad news about Solana’s security or performance, even with a growing TVL, people might get worried and start selling their SOL tokens. This increased supply and decreased demand could cause the price to drop. Can SOL Hit The $30 Milestone? The daily chart shows that the asset has traded positively in the past 24-hour market circle. The coin is trading above the Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicator and is bullish, signaling a potentially strong uptrend and a positive momentum in its price movement. Additionally, it suggests that buyers are consistently active, pushing the price higher. This often indicates sustained demand and can potentially lead to further price appreciation. Meanwhile, the SMA can act as a support level if the price dips, preventing the price from falling too much. However, while the SMA can act as support, it can also become a resistance level if the price moves significantly above it. This is because the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 55 suggests the coin is balanced between overbought and oversold conditions. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also showing an attempt to cross over the signal line, indicated by the red histogram bar fading. This could signal a potential shift in momentum, with the upward movement gaining strength. Related Reading: US Congresswoman Raises Concerns About Paypal Stablecoin In The Absence Of Regulation Considering the analysis, SOL could potentially hit the $30 threshold in a few weeks if the bulls sustain the current market sentiment. So traders can anticipate a bullish move but should consider other indicators and market context for a more accurate assessment of the coin’s direction.

The company has been growing capacity and is guiding for 16 EH/s by the end of the year. This expansion is fully funded per the CEO. There is a history of significant share dilution with CleanSpark, but breakeven isn't terribly far from current BTC price levels. One of the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining stocks that has been quickly scaling production capacity in recent months is CleanSpark ( CLSK ). I last covered the company in April shortly before earnings for calendar year Q1-23. My bull case from that article was the company's low debt and efficient miner fleet. Since then, we have two fresh quarters of financial data to assess and a significant move upward in production capacity. In this article, we'll dive into the key takeaways from the latest earnings report, the balance sheet, and the elephant in the room. Earnings & Performance In the recent 10-Q, CleanSpark reported $45.5 million in revenue, a 7% sequential increase and 22% year-over-year increase. Gross profit came in at $24.8 million in the quarter. That was down from $28.5 million in the prior year period. Cost of revenue was $20.7 million and total opex hit a new high of $39.7 million. Operating income for the quarter was negative $14.8 million; an improvement over Q1 but the company has now lost money in 5 consecutive quarters. Seeking Alpha Despite that, CleanSpark is the second-highest rated Bitcoin miner by Seeking Alpha's Quant Score, and it's the only miner with green factor grades across the board. Another good sign is the improvement in the company's breakeven Bitcoin price so far this year. CleanSpark 1H 22 2H 22 1H 23 Cost of Rev + Opex $70,800,000 $108,300,000 $120,300,000 Bitcoin mined 1,863 2,758 3,495 Breakeven Price $38,003 $39,268 $34,421 Source: CleanSpark, analyst calculations To calculate a rough estimate for that figure, I've added the cost of revenue with the company's total opex for each of the last 6 quarters and divided the cash burn by the number of BTC the company mined. Year over year, CleanSpark has been able to lower the company's breakeven Bitcoin price from $38k down to $34.4k. If CleanSpark can continue to operate an efficient fleet, I'd argue the potential supply crunch dynamics we're observing for BTC on-chain could turn CleanSpark profitable relatively soon. Analyst's graphic (CleanSpark) In the last 12 months, CleanSpark has grown production from 2.9 EH/s to 9 EH/s as of the end of July 2023. And the company's production growth efforts appear to be coming at the right time. During the conference call , CEO Zach Bradford noted CleanSpark is on-track for 16 EH/s by the end of the year. He also hammered home the point that this expansion is fully funded. Balance Sheet From a balance sheet standpoint, CleanSpark continues to be one of the better-positioned companies in the sector. With $650 million in assets and just $18 million in debt on the last report, CleanSpark has one of the lowest debt to equity positions in the industry at roughly 6%. Data by YCharts The financial flexibility from resisting borrowing at high rates has allowed CleanSpark to grow the BTC ""HODL"" in treasury from just 228 at the end of December to 1,061 at the end of July. Of the more mid-tier miners, CleanSpark has been able to scale HODL to a far larger degree by percentage, though there was a smaller starting point than peers. BTC HODL December 2022 July 2023 YTD Hut 8 ( HUT )* 9,086 9,136 0.6% Bitfarms ( BITF ) 405 594 46.7% CleanSpark 228 1,061 365.4% Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) 394 518 31.5% HIVE Digital Technologies ( HIVE ) 2,348 2,032 -13.5% Sources: Company filings, HUT figures as of June It should also be noted that even in aggregate figures, CleanSpark's 833 BTC added to the balance sheet year to date is more than the 732 added by Marathon Digital ( MARA ) and MARA's production capacity was more than double CleanSpark's at the end of July. At the end of June, CleanSpark reported $21.8 million in cash and equivalents, but we know that figure is actually closer to $90 million following a capital raise through stock issuance. And that gets us to the potential problem with CleanSpark's current model. The Elephant In the Room Share dilution became a focal point in the comments section of my April CleanSpark article and rightfully so. There is no question in my mind that CleanSpark has generally been one of the more egregious offenders of diluting shareholders over the last three years when compared to other noteworthy mining companies. Data by YCharts The chart above doesn't even really do CleanSpark's dilution justice. Shares outstanding have nearly quadrupled in less than two years. There were 41.5 million shares outstanding at the end of 2021. As of quarter ended March 31, 2023, there were 97 million CLSK shares outstanding. In the company's latest 10-Q, there were 131.8 million shares at the end of June. And we now know per the company's subsequent events section that there were an additional 20.8 million shares issued as part of the exahash expansion capital raise between July 1st and August 8th. That means the outstanding share count is now closer to 153 million than the 132 million that can be observed in the most recent reported financials. Summary Finally, I will once again point out that I think BTC is better held directly. I believe I've made this point roughly a dozen times in previous Seeking Alpha articles, but I'll mention it again; Bitcoin is best held in a secure, self-custodial wallet. Everything else is a derivative or a proxy, including miners. Depending on what your personal risk tolerance is, simply buying and holding BTC might be an enjoyable enough ride. But for the market participant with a higher threshold for pain and pleasure, miners are interesting trades at cycle turns. That said, long-term investors must be aware that many of these companies have poor fundamentals and require higher Bitcoin prices in perpetuity to eke out positive earnings near cycle tops. When the price of Bitcoin increases, so do the mining rigs that must be purchased to maintain share of global hash rate. The best we can do as speculators is try to find the miner equities that are best positioned to rally from rises in Bitcoin's price. Given the balance sheet health and production capacity guidance, I think CleanSpark is one of those miners. Given the previously mentioned supply crunch possibility for BTC, I think CLSK is a long.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4626952-cleanspark-stacking-sats-and-growing-hash?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15879461.jpeg

Fed Tightens the Regulation of Stablecoins Just a day after PayPal had announced the launch of its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin PYUSD, the Federal Reserve of the U.S. published new guidelines clarifying the ways state member banks can interact with dollar-denominated digital currencies. Basically, national banks are now required to seek permission of the Federal Reserve to engage in any sorts of activities related to the U.S. dollar-pegged digital assets, referred to as “dollar tokens”. According to the statement, state member banks need to notify the Federal Reserve about the activities they mean to perform with the use of dollar tokens, whether it is issuing, holding, transacting, or even testing digital assets. The Federal Reserve might ask for additional information regarding the proposed activity. To proceed with the use of stablecoins in any way, the bank needs to receive a “a written notification of supervisory nonobjection from the Federal Reserve”. “A state member bank seeking to engage in such dollar token activities, including for the purpose of testing, must notify its lead supervisory point of contact at the Federal Reserve of the bank’s intention to engage in the proposed activity and should include a description of the proposed activity. Federal Reserve supervisory staff may follow up with the bank to seek additional information in order to better understand the proposal and the control framework that the state member bank has put in place. After receiving a written notification of supervisory nonobjection, state member banks will continue to be subject to supervisory review and heightened monitoring of these activities,” reads the statement. Mitigating Risks Related to the Use of “Dollar Tokens” To acquire the notification of nonobjection from the Federal Reserve, the bank needs to showcase an effective system of risk management and the ability to measure and control the risks of the proposed stablecoin activities on a regular basis. The Federal Reserve outlines five major types of risks linked to the use of dollar tokens: operational risks: associated with the governance and the management of the network; cybersecurity risks: related to the stablecoin’s network, smart contracts, and any use of open source code; liquidity risks, such as high redemptions of the token in a short period of time; illicit finance risks: customer identity verification, due diligence, monitoring suspicious activities, etc; consumer compliance risks: related to identifying and ensuring compliance. The Federal Reserve has also reported that it would evaluate the banks’ comprehension of the relevant laws and their commitment to them.

The Federal Reserve might ask for additional information regarding the proposed activity. To proceed with the use of stablecoins in any way, the bank needs to receive a “a written notification of supervisory nonobjection from the Federal Reserve”. “A state member bank seeking to engage in such dollar token activities, including for the purpose of testing, must notify its lead supervisory point of contact at the Federal Reserve of the bank’s intention to engage in the proposed activity and should include a description of the proposed activity. Federal Reserve supervisory staff may follow up with the bank to seek additional information in order to better understand the proposal and the control framework that the state member bank has put in place. After receiving a written notification of supervisory nonobjection, state member banks will continue to be subject to supervisory review and heightened monitoring of these activities,” reads the statement. Mitigating Risks Related to the Use of “Dollar Tokens” To acquire the notification of nonobjection from the Federal Reserve, the bank needs to showcase an effective system of risk management and the ability to measure and control the risks of the proposed stablecoin activities on a regular basis. The Federal Reserve outlines five major types of risks linked to the use of dollar tokens: operational risks: associated with the governance and the management of the network; cybersecurity risks: related to the stablecoin’s network, smart contracts, and any use of open source code; liquidity risks, such as high redemptions of the token in a short period of time; illicit finance risks: customer identity verification, due diligence, monitoring suspicious activities, etc; consumer compliance risks: related to identifying and ensuring compliance. The Federal Reserve has also reported that it would evaluate the banks’ comprehension of the relevant laws and their commitment to them.

According to data from Glassnode, this metric which counts only externally owned addresses just reached an all-time high of 104,127,318. But what does this mean for the price of Ethereum? Ethereum Non-Zero Addresses Reach New All-Time High More addresses mean more people are using the network and Ethereum is in the driver’s seat when it comes to most application aspects of the crypto industry. As a result, the Ethereum blockchain has seen the highest growth rate in new addresses in recent years. Related Reading: US Congresswoman Raises Concerns About Paypal Stablecoin In The Absence Of Regulation This growth has been particularly high as more people flock to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the majority of which are built on the Ethereum blockchain. As of the time of writing, there are now 104,127,318 Ethereum addresses holding at least one wei, the smallest unit of ETH. Just around two years ago in 2021, this metric was around 50 million addresses, showing a 100% jump during this time. Although only a fraction of these wallets are active, the high number of non-zero addresses shows the sheer increase in ETH adoption. In the same vein, the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses only recently reached an all-time high of 47.8 million addresses. More Addresses Means Increased Network Activity and Adoption The growing interest in trading, smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs will continue to boost the number of Ethereum users and non-zero addresses, especially now that the industry sits on the cusp of a possible bull run. ETH bulls continue to hold above $1,800 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com According to a similar metric by Glassnode Alerts, the amount of Ethereum supply last active within a seven to 10-year timeframe also just reached n new all-time high of 4.312 million ETH. This extended state of inactivity is suggestive of HODLing and long-term faith on the part of investors. Bullish For The Price Of ETH In the past, major rallies in Ether’s price have coincided with a surge in new addresses on the network. During the 2021 bull run, Ethereum saw a flurry of new addresses and non-zero addresses, as its price reached an all-time high of $4,810. As mainstream interest and adoption of Ethereum grow, the value and price of Ether (ETH) are likely to increase. Non-zero addresses mean activity on many addresses is increasing, which can create buy pressure in addition to other factors that should push ETH’s price higher.

The AAIP outlined its objective of scrutinizing the security protocols in place to safeguard the privacy of Worldcoin users in Argentina.  The agency stated that the case has gained “public notoriety in recent weeks due to the procedure of scanning the faces and irises of numerous individuals in exchange for financial compensation at different locations in Buenos Aires City and the provinces of Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Mendoza, and Río Negro.”  According to the AAIP, an entity like Worldcoin must register with the AAIP, provide information about its data processing policy, and indicate the purpose for collecting sensitive data and the retention period for such data. Additionally, the agency requires details of the security and confidentiality measures applied to safeguard personal information. The AAIP did not confirm whether Worldcoin complies with the standards.

42409999,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRE2R,1691692790,Tokenization News Roundup: Pendulum Swings Toward Doubters,"Here's this week's roundup of the latest stories and reports from CoinDesk and the industry to keep you up to date on the progress of the tokenized real-world assets revolution.  How Crypto Tokenization Can Go Wrong (and How to Make It Right) (CoinDesk)  Real-world assets could become a $5 trillion dollar industry, some analysts project. But, without greater credit availability, certain changes tokenization won't be a meaningful evolution in finance.  Takeaway: Ralf Kubli, board member of the Casper Association, cuts through the splashy trillion-dollar projections for the growth of real-world asset tokenization to warn that the emerging industry needs to focus on standardization to make our financial markets more efficient.  “Let's avoid the path where financial institutions merely upload financial statements to the blockchain and rethink the quality and types of information financial asset tokenization can provide, which will inevitably rewrite the rules on credit.  Otherwise tokenization will only provide the level of transparency and trust as in existing markets — which haven't truly improved since the informational deficits that drove the housing market boom and bust in the late 2000s. Do we really want to recreate the conditions that led to the Great Financial Crisis…?”  Can Swarm Move Tokenization Beyond Hype Into Mainstream DeFi? (BeInCrypto)  The tokenization of real-world assets has offered promise and frustration in equal measure, but one blockchain platform claims regulation is the key to success.  Takeaway: An interview with the founders of Swarm, a fully-regulated decentralized platform that tokenizes real-world assets for use in DeFi protocols, supports similar ideas to those in the CoinDesk op ed by Kubli. Standardization and regulation are critical at this juncture for successful tokenization that will ultimately lead to a healthier future for crypto generally.  ‘Swarm’s bosses argue the right mix of regulation and decentralization is key to the survival of the crypto sector after the failure of FTX. They argue, ‘The standards for bringing assets on-chain need to be rigorous, and the onus is on those in the tokenization space to get this right. Failing to do so will result in a loss of confidence in the blockchain sector.’”  Maple Finance's Tokenized Treasuries Available to U.S. Investors After Securities Exemption (CoinDesk)  The platform's cash management facility has attracted $22 million of deposits since it opened in April.  Takeaway: Blockchain-based credit marketplace Maple Finance has expanded to the U.S. market the opportunity for investors to access liquidity.  “Digital asset firms, crypto investment funds and protocol treasuries often hold substantial amount of cash in stablecoins. Tokenized Treasuries offer them a shield from inflation and a way to earn some yield.” That yield presently is around 4% to 5%, which is why Maple has attracted $22 million of deposits in the first three months that it was available to non-U.S. investors.  What is the tokenization of real-world assets?  Meanwhile, expansion and growth in the RWA space continues apace.  Backed Brings Tokenized Real-World Assets to Six New Blockchains (Yahoo Finance)  Takeaway: Backed, a developer of tokenized real-world assets (not available to U.S. investors, however), is expanding its products to new blockchains. This will provide more flexibility for decentralized-finance developers leading to more diversity in applications and exposure to a wider base of users.  “One of the greatest challenges when tokenizing RWAs is interfacing between TradFi and blockchain infrastructure. Backed solves this by leveraging Chainlink’s decentralized price feeds.” Backed’s tokenized real-world assets can now be accessed on BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Fantom, Avalanche, Gnosis, Polygon, and Ethereum, with more to come.  Artory Expands Leadership and Blockchain Team with Strategic Hires Focused on Tokenized Financial Opportunities (Press Release)  Artory is proud to announce key hires, growing the company’s blockchain and financial expertise.  Takeaway: In addition to Treasuries and real estate, the most common example of a tokenization use case is fine art. Artory is a leading platform in this emerging technology and it is expanding its leadership team with the addition of a chief investment officer as well as engineers.  Plus:  The social media space formerly known as Crypto Twitter – now Crypto X? – also had some cautionary takes on how the tokenization of real-world assets is progressing:  The poster, Thiccy, concludes his thread: “rwa stuff is a nice narrative and all but the failures of maple and now goldfinch show that you're completely shit out of luck if (or when kek) the borrowers rug you why not buy foreign treasuries on-chain instead of lending to Kenyan motorbike companies?”  Thiccy presumably was referring to Maple’s troubles last year: “The new pool indicates that Maple is moving away from uncollateralized crypto lending to crypto trading firms, which resulted in $52 million in bad debt on the protocol and up to 80% losses for select liquidity providers. Those losses came after FTX’s spectacular collapse toppled some of the platform’s largest borrowers.”  As with any emerging technology, there will be bursts of enthusiasm and optimism, followed by criticism and stumbles.

Self-Reliant India In its press release of August 9, 2023, the Indian Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) announced the launch of the Indian Web Browser Development Challenge (IWBDC). “The IWBDC is an Open Challenge Competition that seeks to inspire and empower technology enthusiasts, innovators, and developers from all corners of the country to create an indigenous web browser with its own trust store with an inbuilt CCA India root certificate, cutting edge functionalities and enhanced security & data privacy protection features,” reads the statement. One of the key features that’s expected to be supported by the browser is the digital signing of documents through a crypto token, with the aim to enhance the security of transactions and digital engagements. The release of the India’s native multifunctional web browser will mark a significant step towards “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” (translates to “self-reliant India”), Prime Minister Modi’s plan to make the country more independent, technologically and economically . “Digital India has revolutionized how our nation functions, empowering citizens, boosting the economy and enhancing overall governance. As we move forward, embracing technology and promoting indigenous innovation will be pivotal in realizing the vision of a self-reliant, digitally empowered India,” said Smt Sunita Verma, Scientist G & GC (R&D in Electronics & IT). The Indian Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), Shri Arvind Kumar, strives to ensure the security of digital certificates issued within the country and contributes to developing a robust Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) framework that would enable secure electronic transactions throughout the nation. However, India has been reliant on the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates issued by foreign entities’ roots. Now, the challenge is to integrate India Root Certificate into the upcoming national browser, thus addressing the issue and making the country more “Internet Resilient”. Who Can Participate in the Challenge? All of the country’s creative minds, including academia, industry, start-ups, or individuals, are encouraged to take part in the challenge and submit an idea for the innovative Indian web browser that could cater to a global audience. The challenge will consist of three rounds: 18 participants will be selected in the first round, shortlisted to 8 in the second one, with only 3 coming to the final round. The winner will be granted 34 million Indian rupees (around $411,000) and will receive additional support in further development of the new browser.

15877006,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/08/india-to-launch-a-native-web-browser-powered-with-crypto-tokens,1691692200,India to Launch a Native Web Browser Powered by Crypto Tokens,"India has challenged its residents to develop an indigenous web browser with the feature of signing documents digitally through crypto tokens. Self-Reliant India In its press release of August 9, 2023, the Indian Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) announced the launch of the Indian Web Browser Development Challenge (IWBDC). “The IWBDC is an Open Challenge Competition that seeks to inspire and empower technology enthusiasts, innovators, and developers from all corners of the country to create an indigenous web browser with its own trust store with an inbuilt CCA India root certificate, cutting edge functionalities and enhanced security & data privacy protection features,” reads the statement. One of the key features that’s expected to be supported by the browser is the digital signing of documents through a crypto token, with the aim to enhance the security of transactions and digital engagements. The release of the India’s native multifunctional web browser will mark a significant step towards “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” (translates to “self-reliant India”), Prime Minister Modi’s plan to make the country more independent, technologically and economically . “Digital India has revolutionized how our nation functions, empowering citizens, boosting the economy and enhancing overall governance. As we move forward, embracing technology and promoting indigenous innovation will be pivotal in realizing the vision of a self-reliant, digitally empowered India,” said Smt Sunita Verma, Scientist G & GC (R&D in Electronics & IT). The Indian Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), Shri Arvind Kumar, strives to ensure the security of digital certificates issued within the country and contributes to developing a robust Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) framework that would enable secure electronic transactions throughout the nation. However, India has been reliant on the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates issued by foreign entities’ roots. Now, the challenge is to integrate India Root Certificate into the upcoming national browser, thus addressing the issue and making the country more “Internet Resilient”. Who Can Participate in the Challenge? All of the country’s creative minds, including academia, industry, start-ups, or individuals, are encouraged to take part in the challenge and submit an idea for the innovative Indian web browser that could cater to a global audience. The challenge will consist of three rounds: 18 participants will be selected in the first round, shortlisted to 8 in the second one, with only 3 coming to the final round. The winner will be granted 34 million Indian rupees (around $411,000) and will receive additional support in further development of the new browser.

However, the most important feature of the Shanghai upgrade was allowing validators and stakers to finally withdraw their staked ETH from the Ethereum Beacon Chain. To explain, the Beacon Chain was created to aid the smooth transition of Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work consensus model to a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, i.e., ETH 2.0. Since its launch in 2020, many users have been staking their ETH tokens on the Beacon chain to facilitate network security and earn rewards. Albeit, those assets and the rewards they generate were inaccessible until after the Shanghai upgrade in 2023. Prior to this network upgrade which occurred on April 12, 2023, the total number of staked ETH stood at 18.1 million, according to data by Dune Analytics. Four months later, the token analytics website Token Unlocks has offered more insight into how the Shanghai Upgrade has impacted the ETH staking activity so far.

The report also highlights that 25% of this currently staked ETH was staked after the Shanghai upgrade in April. This means that about 5.84 million ETH, constituting about 4.8% of ETH circulating supply, has been staked in the last four months. To emphasize the impact of the Shanghai upgrade on ETH staking, Token Unlocks noted that the net ETH staking ratio is up by 147%, with about 9.82 million ETH deposited and only 3.97 million ETH withdrawn post-upgrade. It is worth stating that there were some speculations that the Shanghai upgrade would lead to a large-scale withdrawal of ETH, which could negatively affect the crypto market. Interestingly, the report above paints a different reality, with many users now willing to stake ETH as they have the freedom to withdraw at will.

Merging Web2 and Web3 On Wednesday, August 9, the TON, a blockchain system originally created by Telegram, announced the launch of its self-custodial crypto wallet TON Space that would be integrated in the prominent messaging app. The product is now in its beta phase and available for developers only. By applying for the beta version of TON Space, developers will have a chance to integrate the wallet into their apps before everyone else. TON Space aims at facilitating the Web3 adoption by offering the whole user experience entirely within Telegram Messenger. Developers will be able to build their apps, integrate the blockchain, and unboard their users without leaving the platform. “The developers’ beta is a critical moment in launching the first self-custodial wallet built into a thriving Web2 platform,” said Jordan Dunne, Head of DeFi at Wallet. “The introduction of TON Space will allow blockchain developers to build Web3 services that feel like the intuitive mobile app experiences users have every day. Easy-to-use and all without ever leaving Telegram, with 800 million users every month, this opens up a staggering growth opportunity for builders.” Main Features of TON Space As a self-custody wallet, TON Space will provide its users with full control over their assets, allowing them to store, trade, and manage crypto within Telegram. One of the unique advantages of TON Space is that it can be seamlessly linked to any app built on Telegram, all integrated within a single ecosystem. According to the press release, TON Space is the most highly anticipated feature among the users who wish to have full access to the TON network within Telegram Messenger. The custodial wallet is expected to open for consumer use by the end of Q3 2023. The team also plans to integrate NFT collectables and swapping services into the product by that time. “The launch of TON Space is a significant milestone that establishes a new infrastructure layer for the TON ecosystem,” commented Justin Hyun, Director of Growth at TON Foundation. “The power to build decentralized applications and bots fully integrated inside of Telegram cannot be underestimated. These services, and their users, will now enjoy the infinite possibilities that come with the power to store, manage, and trade assets within Telegram.” Telegram vs Twitter? By integrating the crypto wallet, Telegram, which has always had an unwavering emphasis on privacy and security, is now officially entering the Web3 space. The move makes the global messenger a key player in the industry, which could potentially compete with such giants as X (previously known as Twitter), recently bought and rebranded by Elon Musk.

42409988,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRDYg,1691689442,Is Coinbase Disillusioned With Crypto?,"If you go by a handful of headlines and chatter on Crypto Twitter, you might think that the largest publicly-traded crypto exchange Coinbase now thinks bitcoin is about as valuable as a Beanie Baby. And forsooth, good man, woman or human! It is a comparison the exchange drew, in a formal legal document no less.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Coinbase apparently “backpedaled” on a lifetime of saying crypto is the future of finance. The document was submitted on Aug. 4, 2023 but seemingly only recently has caught attention. To wit:  “On Coinbase’s secondary-market exchange and through Prime, there is no investment of money coupled with a promise of future delivery of anything. There is an asset sale. That’s it. It is akin to the sale of a parcel of land, the value of which may fluctuate after the sale. Or a condo in a new development. Or an American Girl Doll, or a Beanie Baby, or a baseball card.”  American Girl Doll? No doubt Coinbase missed the moment to capitalize on the Barbie buzz.  But, no, the exchange has not given up on crypto afterall. Instead the exchange was fleshing out the argument that the nation’s top securities regulator — the SEC, chaired by Gary Gensler — lacks jurisdiction to sue the California-based company because the assets Coinbase deals in are not securities.  In particular, in this case, the exchange is arguing about the legality of its secondary trading service called Prime. I’m not going to go through the history of securities law or how it should be applied to cryptocurrencies: I’m not a lawyer, and there’s plenty of more informed content to read on the matter, given that securities law is seemingly about the only thing discussed in crypto anymore.  But I will say Coinbase’s argument here, specifically about “transactions on Coinbase and through Prime,” generally falls in line with a recent court decision in the SEC’s case against Ripple Labs, which found that most secondary market sales do not represent “investment contacts” or a securities offering.  See also: SEC's Gensler 'Disappointed' by Part of Ripple's XRP Judgement  When you buy crypto from Coinbase, you are just buying crypto — not a stake in the company’s equity or a claim on its future earnings (one of the prongs of the preeminent Howey Test to determine such things). As is the case for Barbie dolls, Beanie Babies or even fine art, buyers may be hoping the asset appreciates in value, maybe especially from the later efforts or labor of Mattel or a Picasso to improve their reputation.  Reasonable people can and have disagreed. Conceptual artist turned law professor Brian Frye, for instance, argues that basically any material good could be considered a security if the SEC wanted to. He’s goaded the SEC to sue him by creating legal documents/art and selling them as NFTs that more or less promise buyers future profit.  And, in many cases, it absolutely makes sense to treat cryptocurrencies as securities. Especially when cryptocurrency issuers are doing as much, like when a startup looking for working capital sells tokens to hedge funds or other “qualified investors” (cough, cough Ripple Labs).  By and large, that isn’t what Coinbase is doing. It’s merely creating opportunities for interested buyers to acquire crypto. The realities and distinctions of assets like bitcoin and XRP matter when compared to traditional securities like stocks or bonds. The price of these assets often benefits from being listed on an exchange, but open and permissionless networks do not require them for these assets to proliferate.  Likewise, Coinbase doesn’t really need me to come swinging for its defense. But for crypto’s skeptics that supposedly value transparency and truth telling more than anyone else, the claim that Coinbase is rolling over at the sight of the SEC is just plain materially wrong. (Finally! An answer to the age-old question of who’s watching the watchers?)  This isn’t to say Coinbase is faultless. Just weeks ago the exchange’s PR unit had to correct the record after CEO Brian Armstrog suggested the SEC asked it to delist all cryptocurrencies but bitcoin, a widespread story that resulted either due to a media error or a misguided attempt astroturfing a “narrative” that became too real too fast and would likely have soured the court’s opinion in its ongoing legal battle.  It’s a company I’ve criticized in the past and will likely continue to, in part because like all crypto exchanges it facilitates some of the worst behavior in crypto where traders essentially play-zero sum games in a quest for riches. I wouldn’t call Coinbase a bucket shop, but considering the trouble it’s had diversifying its income away from trading fees it is inextricably tied to “the degens” — no matter how much Coinbase wants to talk about crypto’s transformational potential.  See also: The Memecoin Grift and How It Threatens Ethereum Culture  Almost every time someone profits from selling a crypto, it’s at the expense of someone else who bought into the system. This is precisely because these immaterial assets rarely have a connection to the real world and often generate little societal value. Many cryptos are created with a purpose, but go used and so don’t contribute to actually making the world better.  (There are the edge cases where dissidents and others in need benefit from the existence of a payments system that asks no questions of them, which, in my opinion, is enough reason for them to be. Plus, I’m not vain enough to think all of crypto is terminal or that organic use won’t come about.)  In a sense, this capital accumulation for the sake of capital accumulation is precisely why cryptocurrencies are not securities. It’s a raw representation of the value that people see in the network, not in the Coinbase’s or Binance’s where they’re purchased. The same is true of Beanie Babies, otherwise wouldn’t Toys R Us still be around?  For what it's worth, a few years ago I actually spoke with a trader who called the top of the Beanie Baby bubble, appropriately named the ""Beanie Meanie,"" who said crypto's lack of adoption isn't all that surprising given in his estimation it ""takes 30 years to create a viable secondary market"" in novelties.  Does that timeframe speed up if crypto is more useful than a doll? Or mean that mean even [rhymes with bitcoins] like “pepeyieldunibotsatoshidoge” will one day find a nostalgic or marginal buyer? Will former Supreme Court Justice William John Howey, rolling in his grave, reemerge to become crypto's ultimate ""Blockchainer Complainer?"" (I know it needs a little work to top ""Beanie Meanie."")  In the end, you can hate crypto or hate Coinbase but you can’t can’t honestly say Coinbase doesn’t believe in crypto. It’d be pure insanity to go through the technical and legal issues of launching a layer 2, if you just thought crypto was a toy going to sit and go dusty on the shelf.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/10/is-coinbase-disillusioned-with-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f572dc358b15e8040445513478fa70837933ce88-3000x1546.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409997,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRDsW,1691689044,CEO of World's Largest Bitcoin ATM Operator Sees Industry Ripe for Consolidation,"Bitcoin Depot is the world’s largest bitcoin ATM operator.  The company went public in July, is well-capitalized, and may seek to acquire smaller operators that struggle with key operational challenges.  A lot has changed since Brandon Mintz bought his first bitcoin on what he describes as a “crappy website” in 2013.  He’s now CEO of Bitcoin Depot, the world’s largest bitcoin ATM operator, which he founded three years after that first crypto purchase. The company went public in July – listing its shares on Nasdaq after a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) – and now Mintz says he’s seeing slimmer profit margins for mom-and-pop operators as competition heats up. The crypto ATM sector is teeming with nearly 40,000 machines worldwide, about 6,400 of which belong to Bitcoin Depot. Consequently, the 29-year-old executive – whose company now has access to the capital markets – says he’s willing to buy out the little guy.  “Before Covid… there were a lot of new entrants into the bitcoin ATM industry, a lot of small operators,” Mintz told CoinDesk in an interview. “If you had everything in place to operate a bitcoin ATM, you could put one on a busy street corner in a big city, and it was almost like a guarantee that you would do decent enough to be profitable.”  Read more: Crypto ATM Operator Bitcoin Depot's Stock Rises 12% in Stock Debut  The “cash cow” quality, or reliable profitability of the bitcoin ATM business may have been the norm before 2020, but that year, the total number of crypto ATMs exploded exponentially from just over 6,000 machines to a peak of nearly 40,000 globally by 2022.  Crypto ATM customers are typically unbanked or underbanked – lacking full access to financial services due to poverty, immigration status or general distrust of the mainstream financial system. Without traditional banking relationships, they can’t purchase crypto from online exchanges like Coinbase or Binance.  Although the process of using a crypto ATM may vary, users are usually only required to have cash, a phone, and a piece of identification. (There may be additional requirements depending on the transaction amount.)  “For us, it is your first and last legal name, your phone number, your email address, and we run you through sanction screening,” Mintz explained. “You also have to verify you own the wallet address being provided personally, and you're not sending bitcoin to a third party.”  The crypto ATM sector is now projected to grow from $117 million to $5.5 billion by 2030, according to market research site Global Information – although Mintz says as the industry matures, small players will likely get squeezed out.  “With the competition these days… you have to have a strong brand that is recognizable,” said Mintz. “A lot of the small operators realized over the past year that it's going to be very difficult to compete. A lot of them, anecdotally from conversations, are thinking about, ‘Should I try to compete, or should I get out and sell my portfolio to some larger company such as Bitcoin Depot?’”  Case in point, in 2019, the firm acquired what Mintz described as a “struggling” Texas-based operator named DFW Bitcoin that owned 10 kiosks.  “A lot of people don't have any compliance staff. They don't even have a website,” Mintz said. “It literally may just be one guy and his brother.”  When regulators come knocking  The lack of robust compliance is one of the most common reasons crypto ATM operators fail. Despite the surge in ATM installations during the past couple of years, March saw the industry’s largest decline in machines, as more than 3,600 of them were shut down, according to crypto ATM data site Coin ATM Radar.  It’s not clear if the high number of shutdowns was due to the February bankruptcy of a large operator by the name of Coin Cloud – a company with more than 4,000 bitcoin ATMs across the U.S. and Brazil – or a major security incident at General Bytes, the largest manufacturer of crypto ATMs, according to Coin ATM Radar, or some combination.  What is clear is that many small operators struggle with regulatory adherence. In February, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) took steps to shut down all 27 crypto ATMs in that country because none had registered with the regulator.  Bity, a small operator in Switzerland, has been told by the country’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) that it must establish the identity of any user involved in transactions exceeding 1,000 francs (roughly $1,150) over a 30-day period. Bity vowed to fight FINMA regarding the issue, and the seemingly undercapitalized firm turned to crowdfunding to raise money for its legal bills.  Even larger firms like Bitcoin of America went out of business due to licensing issues and scams, specifically in Connecticut and Ohio.  Mintz says he realized compliance was critical to Bitcoin Depot’s success early in the company’s history.  “My goal was always to create the strongest compliance program and hire really good compliance staff, including a compliance officer that I hired very early on in the business,” Mintz recalled. “We've always strived to go above and beyond what's legally required of us.”  That early focus on compliance may have been the key to Bitcoin Depot’s current success. The company says it’s on track to bring in around $700 million in revenue this year. With that kind of capital in such a competitive market, Mintz will likely have his pick of the litter when it comes to potential acquisitions.  “We have the best reputation and we have the most access to capital,” Mintz said. “We have the ability more than ever to consolidate the industry.”  UPDATE (Aug. 11, 14:30 UTC): Adds details about Coin Cloud bankruptcy in 13th paragraph.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/10/ceo-of-worlds-largest-bitcoin-atm-operator-sees-industry-ripe-for-consolidation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c0f1c76fd14ce0e5532aea4f18b70ee2ae819b3a-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410000,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRE93,1691687825,Bitcoin Rallies Keep Getting Quickly Sold  — What's Up?,"After a quick surge to start the year resulted in a near doubling of its price, bitcoin (BTC) has traded mostly in a tight range for the past few months, struggling to hold above $30,000 for a sustained period of time.  Since April, and in particular since mid-June, bitcoin's has reversed abruptly anytime it has attempted a breakout above $30,000. The most dramatic occasion came on July 13 when the cryptocurrency surged to a one-year high above $31,800 following a favorable court ruling for XRP in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case against Ripple, the firm that sells XRP. Within hours, bitcoin gave up not just the $31,000 level, but also the $30,000 one, and within days slid below $29,000.  The most recent example came this week, when the price climbed throughout the day on Tuesday to top $30,100 late that afternoon. Before news stories about the rally could even be published, bitcoin slipped back more than 1% to about $29,700. Its price at press time was $29,400.  To be sure, dips in bitcoin during the past few months have also proven to be short-lived, with prices quickly rebounding each time the price declined below $29,000.  Awaiting regulatory clarity  Analysts are pointing to a number of reasons behind the rallies struggling to hold. One i is that many buyers are sitting on the sidelines until they receive clarity on whether the SEC will soon allow a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.  “The market is stuck whilst it awaits new fundamental information,” said Spencer Hallarn, a derivatives trader at market maker GSR. According to Hallarn, until the SEC makes a decision on the recent flurry of spot bitcoin ETF applications, the market will remain flat.  The much anticipated news awaited from the SEC comes after financial giant BlackRock (BLK) filed for a bitcoin spot ETF in mid-June, spurring a number of other traditional asset managers to follow with their own applications (or re-filing of previously denied applications).  Miners are sellers  According to Sean Farrell, head of crypto strategy at FundStrat, another reason behind the lack of momentum is that miners are taking profits ahead of the Bitcoin halving. The so-called halving — where block rewards are cut in half to 3.125 bitcoins from the current 6.25 — is expected to take place on April 16, 2024. “It is evident that this cohort is taking profits following major rallies and capitulating during extended periods of flat price performance,” Farrell said.  The lame follow-through to any rally could also be merely due to a sustained lack of new retail participation in the market, Farrell suggested. “The good news is that this pattern is emblematic of the earlier portions of prior bull markets,” he said. “Some positive ETF news could certainly push us out of this sideways grind.”  Coiling for a big move  “The market has remained in such a tight range for the last month and change has allowed options open interest to cluster in the same area, which results in volatility being suppressed until it gets outside of the recent range,” Hallarn said. Volatility, he said, will be muted until it explodes out of the range and “isn't shackled by this effect any longer.”  Christopher Newhouse, an independent crypto derivatives trader, said there’s been strong resistance around the local highs in derivatives trading. “Even small pops in the front end of the curve are almost immediately sold off. Higher spot prices are not the only thing quickly faded by traders — volatility is as well,” he said.  Echoing Hallarn’s thoughts, Newhouse said that one potential catalyst is the spot ETF and any subsequent delays or an approval. Perhaps that could be an opportunity to short August/September volatility and go long for further dated options, he added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/10/bitcoin-rallies-keep-getting-quickly-sold-whats-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/113d58c52252687aeefe422ee7f400387865a80d-6048x3402.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409991,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRDib,1691687567,"Aragon Mulled Sale of Crypto Project, Leaked Screenshot Shows","Decentralized governance-focused crypto project the Aragon Association considered selling itself in June.  The deliberations came after months of pressure from activist investors who have eyed Aragon’s $180 million treasury.  The Aragon Association, one of the biggest crypto projects building tools to support decentralized governance, is trying to get out of its own governance pickle.  After months of pressure from activist investors eyeing its $180 million treasury, Swiss-based Aragon in June explored “selling the project” to an undisclosed bidder for an unknown price, according to a screenshot of a conversation between an employee of the investment firm Arca and other activists.  The screenshot is part of a 24-page investigative report on Aragon Association written by crypto trading firm Patagon Management LLC. On Wednesday, a message linking to the report was sent by an anonymous Ethereum address to Ivan Fartunov, head of partnerships at Aragon, via a public Ethereum transaction.  The undated report accuses the Aragon Association of years of missteps, including squandering its hulking $180 million treasury of various crypto assets, and questions the organization’s compliance with Swiss nonprofit law. CoinDesk couldn't immediately confirm those allegations.  A spokesperson for Aragon neither confirmed nor denied the sale discussions when contacted by CoinDesk, denied the report's ""unsubstantiated allegations"" and said Aragon would release a transparency report with more detail this month.  For months activist investors engaged in crypto’s “risk free-value,” or RFV, trading subculture — a digital-age version of 1980s' corporate raiders — have accumulated ANT governance tokens in order to pull the levers of Aragon DAO; a token entitles holders to vote on governance matters like how to manage or distribute the project’s treasury.  Unlike most crypto traders who speculate on price action, RFV traders attempt to collect paydays from crypto projects whose native tokens have fallen below “book value,” or the value of its treasury — as Aragon’s ANT has. A common tactic is to lobby for token buybacks and, in some cases, liquidations.  In May, Aragon, wary of the activists’ growing influence, canceled plans to give token holders control over its treasury. That emergency action capped a week of escalating tensions that saw Aragon purge its public documents and ban many suspected activist investors from its Discord.  The CEO of Patagon, Diogenes Caseres, said his firm compiled the report after Aragon expelled the activist investors from its Discord server. Patagon shared it in a community-run server where the banned investors congregated.  “It reflects a distrust Patagon and the wider community had in the project at the time, which is not emblematic of our current view of the project, which has made strides towards protecting token holders,” he told CoinDesk.  Both sides have refused to comment on the situation since May. But the Arca screenshot contained in the report, which CoinDesk verified was authentic, shows that negotiations continued into the summer.  An employee of Arca, one of the leading voices in the activist fight, said the firm is “waiting for the Aragon Association to present next steps/path forward,” and declined to comment further.  Two other activist investors declined to comment on the report ahead of an upcoming meeting with the Aragon Association.  The proposed buyout of Aragon was expected to take “a couple weeks,” according to the screenshot dated June 12; Aragon planned to “re-evaluate” the activists’ proposals if the deal did not go through.  While it is unclear what exactly it would mean to sell a nominally decentralized project, the proposed transaction would be valued at a premium to book value, the Arca employee told fellow activists.  The report, which doesn't detail the status of any sale negotiations, indicates activists have explored a number of mechanisms through which to process redemptions of ANT.  Allegations  According to the report, the media blackout was ordered by Aragon’s leader, Joan Arus, as a precondition to negotiations.  “The Aragon team went as far to [imply] in private conversations that they believed the CoinDesk reporter had been paid to write articles that were not, in the eyes of Aragon, ‘fair’ to them,” the report said. (For the record, CoinDesk reporters don't and have never accepted payment from interested parties for articles.)  Aragon’s own public forums were purged during the activist row in May, the report said. It estimated that 27% of posts remain. Lengthy discussions of Aragon’s acquisitions of other projects had been deleted.  The report delivered to Fartanov Wednesday came from a freshly created crypto wallet. He responded with his own transaction-embedded missive in which he rejected some of the report’s conclusions as “a joke.”  “Cool story Bro. I am responding as I respect the hustle of sending on-chain messages,” Fartanov wrote.

This increase has now seen XRP beat out market leader Ethereum when it comes to the number of daily transactions carried out on the blockchain. Ripple Leading The Pack While the euphoria from Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling has been waning, there is still enough left to continue to drive new milestones on Ripple’s XRP Ledger. The most prominent of these has been the number of transactions that are being carried out on the Ledger since the ruling. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Says He Is Willing To Bet That Ripple Will Win SEC Appeal Despite ending the month of July on a low note, the transactions have picked up in August. According to data from BitInfoCharts, daily transactions on the Ripple Ledger have consistently crossed 1 million since the start of August. This puts XRPL ahead of leading blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), both of which have seen daily transaction figures come out below 1 million this month. On August 2, which has been the best day of the month so far for Ripple, transaction figures crossed 1.3 million, compared to 1.04 million for Ethereum and 390,000 for Bitcoin. XRP daily transactions rise above Ethereum | Source: BitInfoCharts The new milestone comes after XRP first experienced a sharp drop in July. But since then, the blockchain has been on an upward trajectory. According to the present data, the XRP Network carried out 1.1173 million transactions on Thursday, August 9, almost double the number of its July 29 low of 612,000. However, despite the rise in transaction numbers, XRP continues to lag behind Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of volume.

Because so many of a16z’s portfolio companies rely on ZK tech, the firm is making a bet that its own contributions can help those companies succeed.  Silicon Valley venture-capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) released a pair of open-source software projects on Thursday aimed at speeding up the core tech behind zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, the tech that powers some of today's buzziest blockchain projects.  The new ZK research from a16z marks a notable milestone for the venture firm, which has in recent years taken a more active role in developing some of the core tech behind the companies backed by its venture dollars. The projects also mark the firm’s first foray into deep-tech research – underscoring the increasing influence that venture firms are beginning to exert over the technologies that they fund.  The team's first project, Lasso, proposes a new method for speeding up ZK systems. Along with a16z's Justin Thaler, the project's whitepaper was co-authored by Srinath Setty, a researcher at Microsoft, and Riad Wahby, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. The team has released code for Lasso under an open-source license, meaning outside developers can use it in their own projects.  The second project, Jolt, introduces a type of zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) that uses Lasso. Jolt is currently just a research paper, but a16z says it plans to release a version of it in code sometime soon – also under an open-source license.  Because so many of a16z’s portfolio companies rely on ZK tech, the firm is making a bet that its own contributions will play a role in helping those companies succeed — thereby helping its own bottom line. Open source contributions can also bolster a16z’s reputation among developers and builders — which can become an important differentiator if it competes with other firms to lead deals.  Read more: The Trend Towards Blockchain Privacy: Zero Knowledge Proofs - CoinDesk  ZK proofs are cryptographic tools that have applications outside of blockchain but have seen a surge of interest in recent years due to their applicability to blockchain scaling. They have recently become the go-to method for helping blockchains reduce fees, increase speeds, and preserve transaction privacy.  ZK proofs “scale blockchains by kind of doing the hard work off-chain, and only having the blockchain verify the proofs,” said Thaler, an a16z researcher and associate professor at Georgetown University who co-authored the Lasso and Jolt research. With ZK proofs, “you can get a guarantee that this work was done correctly, but not have all the blockchain nodes in the world doing all the work.”  What are Lasso and Jolt?  Lasso, a ZK “lookup argument,” is presented by a16z as an improvement to one of the under-the-hood components powering ZK-SNARKs – a fundamental building block behind a big chunk of ZK-based crypto projects.  According to a16z, Lasso “provides roughly a 10x speedup over the lookup argument in the popular, well-engineered halo2 toolchain; we expect improvements of around 40x when optimizations are complete.” (Halo2 is a popular open-source tool built by the team behind Zcash, a ZK-based blockchain focused on private transactions.)  Alongside Lasso, a16z is also releasing the open-source code for Jolt – its new approach for building zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Virtual machines are computers run entirely by software, rather than hardware, and they serve as the foundation for most blockchains – which are like giant computers that allow anyone to read and write files. ZkVMs are VMs powered by ZK technology – used when security and privacy are paramount to how a VM operates.  One type of zkVM – the so-called zkEVMs – has come to power the new class of Ethereum “layer 2” scaling chains that are currently the talk of crypto developer circles, and have been major recipients of a16z venture money. Early versions of these chains rolled out to users over the past year have already amassed more than $1 billion in user deposits, according to DefiLlama.

AI can enhance the efficiency and security of dapp development on Ethereum, leading to more activity and growth on the platform. AI can also improve decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized trading by enabling automated on-chain strategies and providing insights into smart contract behavior. This can attract more users and capital to Ethereum. AI systems will require interoperability in the future, and the Ethereum network's fast finality, transparency, and programmability serve as an optimal solution. I deconstruct ETH tokenomics and a framework for valuing ETH as an asset. This article explores how artificial intelligence ((AI)) could be a strong catalyst for Ethereum’s growth as a decentralized network and for Ether ( ETH-USD ) as an investment. Ethereum is a decentralized, proof-of-stake (PoS) open source blockchain that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts. It has quickly become one of the most prominent and influential blockchain networks in the world. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily a digital currency, Ethereum is designed to be a versatile platform that hosts a wide variety of decentralized applications (or “dapps”). At the heart of Ethereum's functionality are smart contracts, which enable developers to create complex, automated interactions without the need for intermediaries. ETH serves as the fee (called “gas”) for executing transactions and performing computations on Ethereum. After Ethereum’s switch to PoS in 2022, ETH has taken on a deflationary and value accrual economic design. The thesis is that AI should have a positive impact on ETH’s price through the following channels: AI greatly enhances the efficiency of developers and the security of written code. This will lead to ETH capturing the long tail of more AI-assisted dapp development. AI’s ability to generate unique insights from data can be applied to the vast amount of data provided by public blockchains. Today this application is probably best used for on-chain trading based on money flows, and such applications will lead to more activity on Ethereum. However, many more blockchain data use cases could appear in the future. The next frontier of AI will be interoperable AI systems. Revenue models of AI providers will likely remain as pay-as-you-go schemes for systemic reasons. Thus, interoperable AI systems will probably require a programmable fast-finality settlement layer, where auditability is a perk. Ethereum is the natural candidate for addressing this need. The result of this is that ETH is the “late bloomer” for the current boom in AI – ETH has explosive upside as AI begins to catalyze the development of Web3 and blockchain, and even more so when Ethereum is used as a tool for AI interoperability. First Things First: ETH is Not an AI Pure Play The pure play of AI is going to be semiconductors and cloud computing providers. This is no secret to anyone who does some research. Ethereum remains at the forefront of an evolving Web3 and DeFi landscape, serving as the base layer for a majority of dapps. The price catalysts that AI brings to ETH will be confounded with a lot of other factors. Even before generative AI’s explosion of popularity, Web3 and DeFi were growing industries. One should consider the secular growth trend of Ethereum to be assisted or accelerated by AI. Also, present day AI and decentralized systems are incompatible from a technical perspective. The details are outside the scope of this article. Be very skeptical of Web3 projects that claim to use AI in blockchain applications. Ethereum cannot feasibly “run AI,” despite its Turing completeness. Readers will quickly see that what I present here conceptualizes ETH as a beneficiary of AI through more roundabout methods rather than a direct merging between blockchain and AI as technologies. What is AI and its Current State? Artificial intelligence is a big mathematical model that is “weighted,” or “trained,” or “parameterized,” using real data so that the model can be used to make predictions when given new data. Where it gets extremely complicated, to the tune of being a multi-billion-dollar industry, is in the exact way these big mathematical models become parameterized. One way to imagine what is going on is with one of the simplest predictive models: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. The weights in OLS, or coefficients for the “line of best fit” are found by doing matrix algebra on a matrix representation of the dataset. Details here . OLS is exceedingly simple because the weights are linear, and the variables are assumed to lack collinearity (ie. unrelated to each other). But what if we wanted more complicated and deeper insights? Many things in the real world are nonlinear and have self-referencing or interactive effects. The answer is that we need a different model, a different way of finding weights, and almost definitely a bigger dataset with more variables. AI is the most complicated and cutting-edge iteration of this journey to find deeper predictive insights. So, there are a few important things we can learn from this. The first is that data is the lifeblood of AI . Without data, there is no AI because the mathematical model cannot be parametrized. This is like trying to find a line of best fit without the actual dataset to fit the line through: it’d be a meaningless task. The second conclusion is that AI systems are limited to the scope of the data which has been used to train them . This is also where the AI prejudice or bias narrative comes from: minority groups may be misrepresented in AI training sets, which may cause unintended consequences in which conclusions drawn by AI inherit the biases in the data. A more generalized way to state this problem is that AI today exists as siloed systems . Each model had its own specific dataset and training method, which will impact their respective conclusions, even if they are given the same inputs. The third thing to note is that the machines used to create models are not your average laptop. AI is normally trained in data centers such as those offered by AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud . This is also why big tech, especially cloud computing providers , are more of a pure play on AI. The fact that AI is dependent on specialized hardware contributes to them being siloed systems. The fourth conclusion is that because AI is so dependent on specialized computing solutions, they will inevitably keep cloud computing’s pay-as-you-go model (PAYG) of revenue generation . Cloud computing has great operating leverage because the costs are relatively fixed (land and electricity) but the revenues are practically unbounded by physical limitations. Since AI uses cloud computing, it must adopt PAYG as well, capturing a spread between what AI users pay and what the cloud computing costs. (In practice, because much of AI is owned or developed by big tech, it may be more reasonable to look at AI not as a spread capture business, but rather a specialized instance of cloud computing.) AI Will Catalyze Web3 Development The most direct way AI will impact ETH’s price is by accelerating the pace of Web3 development. AI tools like GitHub Copilot and GPT-4 have become so proficient at writing code that they have dramatically increased the efficiency of developers everywhere. Many of my programmer friends have said that they aren’t even sure if they can code anymore without the assistance of these tools. Yet, they are coding much faster than before. To be clear, humans are still required for writing production level code, but AI shortens the development process by: Providing autocompletion suggestions: It’s a bit like how a smartphone might suggest words when you are texting. You end up being able to turn your thoughts into words much faster. Assisting with debugging and test cases: GPT-4 and even ChatGPT (which is GPT-3.5) are pretty good at identifying issues in code which lead to bugs. They can also generate code to test what has been written. Debugging and testing easily consumes the most time in the development process. Auditing code and finding vulnerabilities: Web3 has a history of exploits, and AI can be used to improve the security of Web3 by identifying patterns which may introduce security flaws. This not only speeds up the development process but also ensures that the dapps are more secure and robust. As a result, we can anticipate a surge in the number of high-quality dapps being launched, and given Ethereum's dominant position in the dapp space, it stands to benefit the most. Many of these protocols will be built on Ethereum, which will drive enormous value to ETH. Most of the actual projects need not succeed for ETH to benefit. However, the existence of a very competitive landscape, further bolstered by AI, ensures that something will emerge which captures substantial market share. No matter what emerges, ETH gains if Ethereum is used as some kind of base layer for Web3. ETH is like the pick and shovels to a Web3 gold rush. AI Can Give DeFi and Decentralized Trading a Boost One of the micro trends in DeFi right now is Telegram trading bots . These enable users to place trades through their Telegram account. Another trend is social copy trading, in which one trader’s actions can be copied by many others using smart contracts. AI stands to bring a lot more trading activity through automated on-chain strategies. These strategies can leverage AI to make intelligent decisions within crypto ecosystems. While the current utility of this approach may be primarily restricted to token speculation, it would greatly enhance the speculating experience. AI's ability to analyze vast amounts of data and make informed decisions is leading to more efficient and potentially profitable trading strategies. This increased activity and sophistication within the platform can attract more users and capital, further boosting Ethereum's prominence and contribute to an increase in the price of ETH. Furthermore, AI can be used to understand the behavior of specific smart contracts. By analyzing the frequency, type, and outcomes of interactions with a particular contract, AI can provide insights into its utility, potential risks, or even detect anomalies that might indicate a bug or a potential exploit. For traders and strategists in the DeFi space, this is invaluable. By leveraging AI-driven chain analysis, they can develop more informed strategies that consider not just market sentiment or global economic indicators, but the very flow of money on the Ethereum blockchain itself. This on-chain intelligence can lead to better risk management, more accurate speculation, and the identification of emerging opportunities before they become mainstream. Note that the use of AI in this manner isn’t technically new. Quantitative funds have long used big data models to analyze vast amounts of data and execute trading strategies. What is new is that there has never been the plethora of data offered by public blockchains. The granularity of blockchains leaves nothing unanswered. AI can be trained to follow “smart money” wallets, or to make deep insights based on the visible flow of funds on-chain. The AI model would not be on-chain, but smart contracts can be made to receive instructions from an off-chain node which hosts the AI. These setups will probably start popping up over the next year, and they could generate a lot of interest in crypto speculation. AI trading insights based on real-time on-chain data will add to the existing tailwinds of real-world asset (RWA) RWA Tokenization: What Does it Mean to Tokenize Real-World Assets? and institutional adoption. As more RWAs enter Ethereum, it will lead to more trading opportunities. Similarly, as more dapps are developed, many will release their own protocol tokens, which also leads to more trading opportunities. On-chain trading means higher demand for gas, which directly increases the value of ETH. AI Incentivizes the Adoption of Public Blockchains This is tangentially related to the last point. Again, data is the lifeblood of AI. Public blockchains have data like nothing else. Every bit of transaction data is permanently recorded. Every interest rate, funding fee, swap, liquidation, buy, or sell is recorded. Although Web3 is commonly pitched as allowing users to “own their data,” the reality is that the current infrastructure of Web3, public blockchains, ensures that no has exclusive access to any raw data. This could be good or bad, but it is definitely good for those developing AI because they will have unlimited access to extremely comprehensive datasets. Therefore, I would not be surprised if big tech begins to encourage the usage of programmable public blockchains, like Ethereum. The need for more data will make this both a logical and desirable course of action for them. Because crypto is heavily swayed by narratives, a narrative of established firms actively encouraging the use of Ethereum will be great for ETH. Ethereum May be Needed for AI Interoperability Remember, AI models are siloed: each model is trained on different data using different parametrization methods. Having models communicate with each other will become very important. Interoperability will become a major forefront of the industry to unlock the insights of multiple AI systems working together. As mentioned, today’s AI operates on a PAYG or pay-per-use model. Users might be allocated a certain number of ""credits"" that can be used before incurring additional costs. This model is efficient in a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) context, as it typically involves just one hop between the AI provider and the consumer. However, as AI continues to evolve, the need for interoperability between different AI systems will become increasingly apparent, and this simple model may no longer suffice. Unlike B2C, AI-to-AI could involve many hops. In truth, no one knows how a resilient system of interoperable AI might look like or interact. We do know that the industry has a nearly guaranteed likelihood of advancing toward AI interoperability. Why? Because like telecommunications networks, Metcalfe’s law should apply to AI networks. The value of a network scales quadratically with the number of interacting individuals in the network. However, AI will not have the lag times of these human networks. An online argument in an Internet chat forum could take weeks to settle down because people aren’t always looking at their computers. Unlike adults with nothing better to do than argue about politics with a stranger they’ll never meet, the AI models would be considering real issues, constrained only by the speed of light. Billions of back-and-forth’s between dozens of AI models might be settled in minutes. That would be a lot of hops. Since each hop is subject to a PAYG model (due to cloud computing’s revenue model), interoperable AI systems require a payment and settlement layer that can handle digital payments at these speeds. This layer must not only be swift but also possess a high degree of programmable logic to address the intricacies and potential frictions that arise when different AI systems communicate. For example, what if one query within this multi-hop route is unexpectedly big that the machine takes a bit longer to process it? This could lead to undesirable race conditions . Ethereum's smart contracts offer a solution. These self-executing contracts, with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, provide the necessary programmability and flexibility to facilitate seamless interactions between multiple AI systems. To be clear, it won’t be the Ethereum base layer that settles these. Rather, it would be a highly optimized L2 that supports nano-payments and high throughput. But ETH is still required to publish the state to Ethereum. Traditional financial systems, with their inherent delays and potential for reversals, are ill-suited for the rapid and final settlements required for interoperable AI systems. On-chain settlements, on the other hand, offer both the speed and finality essential for these transactions. Once a transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, it is irreversible, ensuring that settlements between AI systems are both quick and final. Also, a crucial aspect of this interoperable future is the assurance of fairness and transparency. AI providers need the ability to audit transactions and ensure that they are not underpaid for what they provide. Ethereum's transparent and immutable ledger provides this capability. Every transaction, every smart contract execution, is recorded on the blockchain, allowing for easy audits and verifications. This transparency ensures that all parties involved can trust the system and be confident in the fairness of their interactions. In conclusion, as AI systems evolve and seek greater interoperability, the need for a reliable, fast, and transparent settlement layer becomes paramount. Ethereum, with its smart contracts and on-chain settlement capabilities, is poised to play a pivotal role in this next frontier of AI development. The integration of these technologies can further solidify Ethereum's position and increase the price of ETH. ETH Valuation To value ETH, we should conceptualize it as a mix between a security (with yield) and a money (with liquidity premium). Gas on Ethereum are paid in ETH and separated into a protocol-determined base fee and a user-determined priority fee. The base fee is “burned,” which means to be removed from the supply. The priority fee is kept by the validator and is used to incentivize the validator to include the transaction in the block. Validators must stake ETH to build blocks and earn priority fees. Another reward stakers/ validators earn is the block issuance, where about ~1700 ETH/day is added to the supply. This inflation is more than cancelled out by the burned base fees, such that ETH is deflationary. It's easy to see that the cash flows received by ETH owners resemble dividends and buybacks – the traditional means by which cash is returned to shareholders. The distribution of these cash flows, however, are dependent on the actions that the ETH owner takes; it’s not as clear cut as simply buying ETH and holding it. For example, if you just held ETH without staking it, then the only cash flow you would receive comes from the net deflation of ETH supply due to the gas burn. This is like if you were an AAPL shareholder, but you were unable to receive any dividends from Apple Inc. – the only cash you would get comes from AAPL buybacks, which increase AAPL’s price. Staking ETH makes your ETH position resemble an equity position – you benefit from both the dividend (from the gas that is distributed to stakers) and the buybacks (from the gas that is burned). Technically, stakers also benefit from a Cantillon effect where they get newly issued ETH from the block reward. Think of this as issuing shares exclusively to shareholders who are promising not to sell their shares. At any given time, Ethereum’s “dividends” are evenly distributed to ETH stakers. Therefore, it is better for you as an individual investor if a very small amount of staked ETH (ideally, only your ETH are staked, so you get all the dividends Ethereum pays out). At the same time, if every single ETH was staked, the network would halt completely because no ETH can be spent on gas and the source of all yields will be gone. This is where the money aspect comes into play, and where things get convoluted. Staked ETH creates the economic effect of an equity security. ETH that isn’t staked has the economic role as money. Money, being the most liquid good in an economy, of course gains a liquidity premium – people will either pay more or require less yield for liquidity. However, the existence of this premium is contingent on what the owner decides to do with the ETH: there is an embedded option. And whenever ETH is acting as money, ETH’s value comes from the demand for the economic services on Ethereum, which is also where the cash flow to ETH owner’s (both stakers and non-stakers) come from. To make it even more complicated, Ethereum itself is like a mix between a company and an economy. Income flows to ETH stakers, but the means of generating this income comes from an open network in which anyone can participate and set up their own enterprise. For example, Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) is a decentralized exchange which causes the most burned gas on Ethereum. Uniswap also charges a trading fee, earning revenue for itself. Burn Ranking (ultrasound.money) Thus, any valuation should evaluate the equity, the money, and the embedded option aspects of ETH. The market doesn’t seem to be pricing in AI’s impact because the YTD return of ETH has been almost perfectly correlated with BTC, albeit significantly lagging. The dominating crypto narrative this year seems to be Bitcoin, and by extension the rest of crypto, emerging as a legitimate alternative asset class and garnering institutional support. Crypto has gained notable strength especially after the banking scare in March. ETH and BTC (Seeking Alpha) Staked ETH, the most equity-like, receives all Ethereum fees as either a direct ETH distribution or as the gas burn. There a few numbers are out there for annualized fees. Token Terminal gives $2.2 billion as the annualized fees given the last 30 days of fees. Over the last year, there was $2.0 billion in fees. Ethereum Cumulative Fees 365 days (Token Terminal) But remember, staked ETH also exclusively receive the issuance of new ETH, and this is a cash flow which is not captured by fees alone. Ultrasound.money is a website which tracks ETH statistics in real time. Currently, the issuance yields about $1.4 billion a year. ETH metrics (ultrasound.money) Therefore, staked ETH receives an annual cash flow of about $3.5 billion. With a market cap of $223.5 billion, ETH’s price to cash flow ratio is about 64x. This is much more expensive than MSFT and GOOG, a bit more than TSLA, and much less than NVDA. Tech Valuations Comps (Seeking Alpha) But this multiple is treating ETH as having a singular equity use case. It can also be used as money on Ethereum. And, since every ETH can be switched from staked to unstaked with relative ease, there is a perpetually embedded option which the owner can freely exercise to convert the use case from equity to money or back. Thus, ETH’s true multiple if we tried to make all things equal to equities would be noticeably lower. For instance, if we assumed the liquidity premium warranted us to pay twice as much, then the true multiple might be very close to that of MSFT, especially when considering the embedded option too. When we add the potential for AI to catalyze an increase in the use of Ethereum, we see that there is strong fundamental upside for ETH. Right now, the multiple is priced like a big tech company. Even without AI, Ethereum has far higher growth potential than most tech companies because its open network allows for unbounded, free market innovation while a tech company will inevitably be constrained by its own operational economies of scale. Ethereum also stands to take enormous market share through Web3 – it is more like an early-stage company operating in a niche market that has a good chance of going mainstream, if we desire to keep using the company analogy. For now, Web2 is the dominant form of the Internet. Capturing a small fraction of this market share would mean huge upside for Web3, and by extension ETH. Also note that the higher expected growth alone warrants a higher multiple. Now if we consider the AI possibilities outlined above, the bull case becomes even stronger. AI leading to better Web3 development will accelerate Ethereum’s already promising growth trend. In the last two years, smart contract deployments on Ethereum and Ethereum L2s have grown rapidly. And that was mostly without the help of the AI tools we have today. In the next few years, Web3 should see a lot more innovation heavily assisted by AI. Smart Contracts Deployed on EVM (Alchemy) In the next few months, I wouldn’t be surprised to see projects that use AI for on-chain trading, which will bring a lot more activity and interest to crypto. And in the long run, there is a good chance that AI interoperability will require the use of Ethereum. Given these AI catalysts, I can see fees doubling over the next few years, and I believe ETH’s multiple should be 30-60% higher than it is today, making ETH a buy for investors who can stomach some volatility. At 100x cash flows, ETH would still be much cheaper than NVDA, which is a true AI pure play. Given Ethereum’s unbounded potential to scale, I would say this is a fairer valuation than what it is right now. Risks There are many risks to this thesis. The main one is that ETH is not the only blockchain. It is possible to make something far more performant that attracts much more developer attention. This blockchain could be the new launchpad of Web3, and ETH would get crushed as a result. I think this outcome is highly unlikely because although Ethereum isn’t perfect, it has the most people working to perfect it. There is already a very strong network effect. Ethereum will probably be a long-term winner in Web3. The biggest threat in this aspect is Bitcoin. It is possible to build Turing complete layers on top of Bitcoin. One method is through merged-mining, which reuses Bitcoin proof-of-work’s expended work to validate transactions. Rootstock is such a Bitcoin merge-mined blockchain which runs the Ethereum Virtual Machine on its network. However, these alternative chains have very low activity compared to Ethereum. The other risks relate to the AI assertions. It is possible that AI is not used to accelerate Web3 development. However, one would need to answer the question of what those developers would be doing instead. The reality is that there are only a handful of spaces in tech this decade that are particularly lucrative, including: AI, blockchain, Web3, quantum computing (which is mostly hardware today). If developers randomly picked one, there is a good chance they’ll land in Ethereum. Another risk is that AI interoperability will not involve Ethereum at all, or only on a minor scale. For this, I don’t have a strong defense. However, Ethereum is the system that exists today which seems best suited to address the issues AI interoperability would likely run into. It is possible another public P2P network is created specifically for AI interoperability, but this would require a lot of separate profit-seeking parties to coordinate on building a new base layer when a good solution, Ethereum, already exists. Conclusion Overall, ETH is a buy given secular trends. It is even more so a buy given the boost that AI could quite feasibly give to Ethereum over the next few years. Don’t expect these results to come immediately. Some, like AI trading bots which follow on-chain flows, will likely appear very soon. Others, like AI-assisted Web3 development, will take longer. Finally, AI as an industry requires time to grow into a need for interoperability.

The product currently supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche networks, with other chains coming soon. Programmable Wallets allows developers to seamlessly integrate secure crypto wallets into any application, thus expediting the adoption of Web3 and blockchain technologies. “​​Programmable Wallets bridge the gap between today’s internet and blockchain networks by abstracting complexities such as private key security, blockchain node operations, transaction management, interoperability across blockchains, and many others to enable developers to iterate on applications faster,” reads the statement on the Circle’s website. One of Programmable Wallets’ key features is that it gives developers the freedom to customize the crypto wallet experience to best fit their use case. This helps greatly increase customer satisfaction because different types of apps (DeFi, games, e-commerce, etc.) will use their crypto wallet in different ways. Programmable Wallets offers a self-service, end-to-end solution, enabling developers to register, build, and implement their first wallets and transactions within minutes. The developer console provides all the necessary tools for debugging, launching, and scaling Web3 applications. According to the company’s press release, these are the core features of Programmable Wallets: User-controlled wallets: gives end-users full control of their assets; Developer-controlled wallets: allows developers manage assets on behalf of users; REST APIs manage both user-controlled and developer-controlled wallets; iOS and Android SDKs speed up development processes and facilitate wallet UI customization; Webhooks keep users updated on their incoming or outgoing transactions; Wallet operations dashboard enables developers to monitor transactions; Multiparty computation (MPC) is a built-in cryptographic security configuration; Blockchains Agnostic allows to build a wallet once and use it across different blockchains; Pay-as-you-grow provides a rebate on USDC usage, starting at $0.05/Monthly Active Wallet. Other features such as Gas Abstraction and Smart Contract Wallets should be rolled out shortly. Circle Expands the Range of Its Web3 Solutions Earlier this year, Circle launched a Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to allow permissionless transfers of USDC natively across supported blockchains. A couple of months later, the platform announced the operationalization of its CCTP on Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum network, with the aim to make the USDC transfers faster and more secure. “With USDC, CCTP, Programmable Wallets, and our broader Web3 Services offering, our goal is to make it easy for developers to rapidly build, deploy, and scale blockchain-powered apps for a variety of use cases, regardless of the blockchain network they choose to build on,” the Senior Director of Product Management at Circle, Gagan Mac, wrote in the statement.

42409982,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRDOl,1691683699,How Crypto Tokenization Can Go Wrong (and How to Make It Right),"Money doesn't make the world go round; credit does. Credit predates any known form of currency and was in use at least as far back as the ancient civilization of Sumer around the year 3500 B.C.E. In Sumer, citizens could get loans for agricultural purposes, later paying these back via a percentage of their crop. By comparison, the oldest coin-minting operation ever discovered only dates back as far as about 640 B.C.E.  Ralf Kubli is a board member at the Casper Association.  Credit is the true foundation of finance. Not money or individual payments, but payments over time, aka cash flows. Cash flows allow entities to predict future financial states and develop strategies based on that information, which is why it’s often regarded as the lifeblood of the world economy. But if this is the case, why is the move toward tokenization and digitization so focused on money?  The credit landscape today  Today, credit remains the foundation of all finance. However, we are also navigating unprecedented times. There is a credit crunch looming in the U.S. as the broader economic outlook worsens. As a result, fewer loans are being offered and those that are have become more conservative resulting in a $2 trillion gap of unmet demand for finance.  This disproportionately harms small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are generally in the most need of financial support as they get off the ground.  Part of the cause behind this is that large capital providers struggle to conduct adequate due diligence and risk management for their SME debt, resulting in the lack of options for borrowers. Instead, these lending platforms only focus on high-quality borrowers, ignoring many SMEs, even though they could generally charge much higher interest rates.  See also: The Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA) Explained  The situation stems from the fact that capital providers are stuck in a catch-22 situation. To provide opportunities for securitization on a larger scale, lenders would need to work with higher-risk borrowers. This would inevitably lead to higher default rates, which most capital providers won’t tolerate. Subsequently, the overall volume of credit remains relatively small, leaving many borrowers out of luck.  Enter tokenization  Fortunately, there is a potential fix here. The rise of blockchain technology is reshaping how many companies trade their financial assets. Blockchains allow existing real world assets (RWA) and capital to be “tokenized,” i.e., representing certain assets, be they tangible, intangible or financial, on-chain as digital tokens.  It's relative easy for intangible and financial assets to trade because they effectively already exist digitally. Physical assets are a bit trickier, because what does it mean to own a token representing a physical good? With the right definitions and architecture, however, it is by no means impossible to represent real world goods on a blockchain.  The world is on the cusp of a tokenization boom. The tokenization industry is projected to reach a valuation of $3-$5 trillion by 2030, with big names like JPMorgan and BlackRock already signaling their interest.  Real estate and equities are currently the predominant forms of tokenized assets, according to a recent report from Digital Asset Research. Among the 41 centralized finance organizations focused on RWAs the researchers considered, 26 have established their own tokenization markets and 30 of them facilitate RWA fractionalization.  And it’s no surprise. The benefits of tokenization include increased liquidity, faster settlement, lower costs and better risk management of financial assets. A massive shift in institutional tokenization could easily bring enough liquidity into the credit market to address the current shortcomings, which would be a major boon for SMEs and economic development in general.  Imagine that, crypto having a real world impact.  However, there’s a catch. Currently, most tokenization of financial assets is just that: digital representations of reserves held by companies. But that doesn’t paint the whole picture of an asset. It misses the granularities of how various assets actually exist, like their financial obligations, liabilities or cash flows.  In some cases, companies merely encrypt the hash of a PDF containing their “terms and conditions,” while tokenizing. Even if that contract properly defines the full balance of assets and liabilities, it still requires a human to read the document and calculate the underlying revenue potential.  Such lackluster efforts certainly do not bring any new efficiencies to the market, or take full advantage of the level of transparency and finality that the blockchain presents. Let's avoid the path where financial institutions merely upload financial statements to the blockchain and rethink the quality and types of information financial asset tokenization can provide, which will inevitably rewrite the rules on credit.  Otherwise tokenization will only provide the level of transparency and trust as in existing markets—which haven't truly improved since the informational deficits that drove the housing market boom and bust in the late 2000s. Do we really want to recreate the conditions that led to the Great Financial Crisis in age of crypto and using crypto?  Tokenization done right  To bring about all the benefits of tokenization and ensure we avoid another recession caused by bad debt and leverage, all tokenized financial assets need to not only digitize the asset itself but also define its underlying cash flows and liabilities as well.  Further, this information must be standardized — I suggest using tried and tested financial asset standards like ACTUS, which can be implemented at a code level. This incidentally would have the benefit of making the entire on-chain credit system interoperable. Smart contracts aren’t truly smart, but smart financial contracts with certain definitional standards for tokenized assets would enable cash flows and liabilities to become machine-readable as well as executable and auditable.  See also: Tokenize Everything: Institutions Bet on Crypto's Future  This will open up many possibilities. Most notably, it will greatly boost efficiency and transparency, inherently making the economy operate much more effectively. It will also unlock a tremendous amount of liquidity across a wide array of industries, but most importantly, for our purposes, it will bring a wave of available credit options that SMEs can tap into.  This stands to boost innovation while simultaneously minimizing the risk that future financial meltdowns can ever again rattle global markets.  All this is precisely why the finance industry needs to tokenize correctly, with standardized definitions and the complete representation of cash flows. Until we see this, blockchain technology won’t truly bring about any meaningful evolution in finance, and we will still be at risk of the ongoing contagion that spreads when businesses collapse.  Worst still, SMEs will continue to bear the brunt, as the institutions that survive will only become more restrictive with their loans. If we want finance to truly enter the 21st century in a healthy way, thoughtful, standardized tokenization is the answer.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Ralf Kubli,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/10/how-crypto-tokenization-can-go-wrong-and-how-to-make-it-right,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bddd2de6b47eda24dc94477cb7ac06aeeeb43f58-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409989,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRDbz,1691683453,Digital Currency Group Files to Dismiss Crypto Exchange Gemini’s Fraud Claims,"Crypto conglomerate DCG is seeking to dismiss a fraud lawsuit brought by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’ Gemini exchange.  Digital Currency Group argues Gemini is trying to deflect blame for the problems at Gemini’s Earn lending service.  Also on Thursday, DCG filed the controversial promissory note at the center of the controversy.  Digital Currency Group, or DCG, filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought last month by cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, which alleged the crypto conglomerate and its founder, Barry Silbert, committed fraud through DCG’s Genesis subsidiary that held funds for Gemini’s Earn program.  Gemini’s July 7 lawsuit claims DCG and Silbert misrepresented the financial health of lending subsidiary Genesis and induced Gemini Earn customers to continue in the lending program, even though DCG and Silbert were aware Genesis had a billion-dollar hole in its balance sheet linked to last year’s collapse of Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund that's also known as 3AC.  In its response on Thursday, DCG said Gemini hadn’t supported its fraud claims in the lawsuit. (DCG owns CoinDesk.)  Gemini said it had no comment on the filing.  The Gemini Earn program was launched in February 2021. It allowed the exchange’s retail customers to earn yields of up to 7.4% by lending their crypto assets to Genesis. The implosion of 3AC in June 2022 harmed Genesis, whose position became even worse after crypto exchange FTX’s collapse in November 2022. Gemini had to halt withdrawals from the Earn program that month, and Genesis filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 19, 2023.  Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss  DCG called Gemini’s July complaint a continuation of a “public relations campaign” carried out by the exchange’s owners, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and “an effort to deflect blame by contriving a public, Twitter-based character assassination campaign against Defendant DCG (Genesis’ indirect parent) and Silbert (DCG’s founder) — neither of whom operated, oversaw or had any substantive involvement with the Gemini Earn program.”  DCG also said Genesis “is not a defendant here,” claiming that “Gemini actively encouraged its existing customers to lend their digital assets (including cryptocurrencies) to Genesis in exchange for interest, representing to its customers that it was a sophisticated market participant and that it had thoroughly vetted Genesis.”  A critical component of Gemini’s complaint concerns claims that DCG and Silbert assured the Winklevoss twins, during a meeting in the summer of last year that DCG had absorbed a $1.1 billion hole left in the Genesis balance sheet caused by the 3AC collapse. The Winklevoss twins claim the loan, a 10-year promissory note at 1% interest, was misrepresented to them as a short-term receivable that could be cashed out in a year.  DCG, in its dismissal, said Gemini “does not explain” why the representation made by Silbert at a lunch meeting with a Gemini co-founder was fraudulent. On Thursday, DCG entered the promissory note into the court docket of the case.  Although Gemini initially filed its lawsuit in New York’s State Supreme Court, DCG successfully shifted it to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, court records show.  “At its core, the lawsuit is a continuation of the Winklevoss’ yearlong Twitter-based character assassination and public relations campaign against DCG and Barry Silbert to deflect blame from their own mismanagement,” a representative for DCG said via email.

42409995,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRDvp,1691683413,DeGods Sales Leap as Artwork Evolution Is Unveiled,"DeGods “Season III” will add artwork to give each holder four artistic assets associated with their one DeGods token.  In 24 hours, trading volume increased nearly 200% to 1,359 ETH, or about $2.5 million.  It’s uncertain if overall non-fungible token (NFT) trading volume will come back after falling 50% since January, but for popular profile-picture (PFP) project DeGods, it sure looks like it.  According to data from marketplace OpenSea, in the past 24 hours DeGods’ trading volume has increased 197% to 1,359 ETH – about $2.5 million – as traders collectively purchased 158 DeGods. It's also taken top spot on the NFT platform's leaderboard of collections.  While its floor price has decreased from 8.8 ETH to 7.4 ETH during this sales spree, a $13,600 NFT is still a hefty spend in the bear market and could be a positive sign for NFT sales trends beyond DeGods.  Early Thursday morning, DeGods revealed its plans for its “Season III” of the collection, which will add 20,000 new artworks to the collection. Not only will DeGods be adding female PFPs to the project that are swappable for male PFPs, but they will also be removing traits from NFTs that holders “don’t like” and adding new ones to replace them.  “We took into account rarity, provenance and innovation to make sure that each new trait would be a moment of delight that would fit into their entire design system,” DeGods said in a tweet.  DeGods specified that this approach means there will be “no dilution” for the collection. Instead of adding new tokens, each individual DeGod NFT will now have four pieces of generative art associated with it. Dilution is a common concern among NFT projects that add additional tokens with similar artwork to a collection, as seen with the chaos of the Azuki “Elementals” mint in June which the project has yet to recover from.  DeGods tweeted that it would cost 333 DUST for a holder to update their token. DUST is the collection’s native utility token, which currently trades at $2.26 according to analytics platform CoinGecko. The collection specified that 100% of the DUST will be put towards its “Points Parlor” prize pool for DeGods Season III holders to play games and earn prizes.  DeGods added that if holders can’t afford to spend the nearly $750 to update their token, the price to do so will gradually decrease over time to invite more holders to morph their tokens.  DeGods started as a Solana-based NFT project, but following the collapse of FTX and its harsh impact on the network’s token, the project migrated to leading NFT network Ethereum. It also moved its Solana-based sister collection, Y00ts, to sidechain Polygon, accepting a $3 million grant from Polygon Labs to do so.

42409992,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRDlu,1691682300,What in the World Is Going on With Crypto Regulation?,"While the technologies underpinning blockchain, crypto and tokenization continue to rapidly evolve, the regulatory frameworks of many countries continue to develop. We have seen some regions with unclear regulatory frameworks, while others are making their regulatory stance clear.  The digital asset space needs pillars of trust via regulatory certainty to bring codified benefits for investors, enabling the community to grow safely and function long-term.  Below, David Lawant and Purvi Maniar of FalconX have simplified the current global cryptocurrency regulation landscape, explaining how certainty has already impacted price movement.  Read on to understand the blossoming regulatory frameworks at work in our industry.  – S.M.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Navigating the Global Crypto Regulatory Environment: Global Developments and the U.S. Challenge  Technical developments and the blossoming of additional applications have been the hallmarks of crypto bull markets. More surprisingly, as the technology has matured, regulatory clarity has been a keen driver of crypto markets since the emergence of this asset class.  Japan’s recognition of crypto as a means of payment in 2016 was a relevant driver behind the 2016-2017 bull market. Even more significantly, a series of interpretative letters from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the primary U.S. bank regulator, that gave comfort to financial institutions to engage with crypto in 2020 was an undeniable catalyst for the 2021 run.  Crypto has grown to the point that regulatory clarity is critical for the next potential bull market. And as the stakes get higher, the dynamics are becoming more complex.  The casual observer might be surprised by the sheer number of regions across the globe attempting to attract crypto businesses and innovators, by offering clear and understandable regulations. These are just some of the key developments in 2023 so far:  Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) started accepting applications for crypto trading platform licenses in June. A regulated U.S.-dollar-backed stablecoin was also launched in June (but retail access is currently restricted).  Japan, perhaps encouraged by its strict regulatory regime that protected customers even from the FTX downfall, published a Web3 white paper in April to create a friendlier environment for crypto and reversed its stance of levying capital gains on unrealized profits in June.  After three years of discussions among European policymakers, the third largest economy in the world finally published the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law last June in its official registrar, with most provisions coming into effect at the end of 2024.  The British upper house recently approved a crypto and stablecoin regulation bill that will now go to the lower house for consideration. Giant crypto venture capital firm a16z chose London as the location of its first office due to its friendly crypto stance.  On the other hand, it is hard to deny that the U.S. is lagging behind other financial jurisdictions in providing the regulatory clarity that the industry craves so much.  Lack of U.S. banking access was a meaningful barrier to operations for crypto firms earlier this year due to what many considered a coordinated effort, which the industry nicknamed Operation Chokepoint 2.0. The SEC’s engagement with the crypto industry has gone beyond the welcomed chasing of bad actors to creating widespread uncertainty around applicable crypto regulation that is now driving legitimate players to move offshore.  There are, however, early signs that the tide is turning for crypto in America.  The Blackrock spot BTC ETF filling in mid-June marked the start of the most compelling round of such fillings to date. The SEC also indicated an openness to futures-based ETH ETFs. Recently, bills addressing crypto market structure and stablecoins have passed their relevant committees with bipartisan support. PayPal just announced a payments stablecoin using the Ethereum blockchain.  Each one of these events suggests a move towards improving the regulatory status for crypto in the U.S by key industry players or legislators.  Crypto regulatory clarity is no longer a wish list item but a necessity. The good news is that the balance of events in 2023 skews strongly positive around many significant jurisdictions. The not so good news is that we likely still have a long and winding road to get to where the industry wants and deserves to be. In the U.S.,for example, even if the market structure and stablecoins bills pass the House they will still have to deal with potentially more hostile Senate and White House, likely during a national election year.  We are optimistic. Even if the regulatory developments worldwide are not perfect and the U.S. still has a long way to catch up, in a few years we will remember this time as the critical juncture in which the foundational groundwork for adequate crypto regulation was laid out.  - David Lawant and Purvi Maniar from FalconX  Ask an Advisor: Can clients invest in crypto in the U.S.?  Q: My U.S. clients have already invested in crypto, but are worried about whether it’s legal. How can I help them?  A: You can start with some education for your clients regarding regulations. Unfortunately, in the U.S. we have less regulatory clarity than virtually anywhere else in the world when it comes to crypto assets. The need for clarity falls to many regulatory bodies – the SEC, IRS and Treasury Department, mainly.  If your clients have purchased crypto assets through an exchange like Coinbase or Kraken, they may not have been deemed a security at the time of purchase. If the tokens they invested in are later determined to be securities, your client may have tax considerations to manage.  For now, we’re sure bitcoin is not a security. Everything else is up for grabs, and the answer for any individual asset may be more nuanced than a simple “yes or no.”  The issues with regulations revolve around the ability to issue and market the tokens. If a token is determined to be a security, it would likely have to be delisted from most U.S. exchanges, which could have dramatic value implications. This is a good place to have a conversation about the risks of investing in crypto.  Q: My clients want to know: Should they set up crypto accounts or wallets in more friendly jurisdictions?  A: This really depends on the amount of money your clients are investing in crypto. Clients who hold large crypto positions can consider geographical arbitrage. However, that could potentially cause more problems than it solves as they have to navigate more regulatory environments.  Regardless, if you have clients investing significant sums, it might be time to enlist a seasoned crypto CPA or attorney that can help with those questions. The jurisdiction where the assets are held, and the form in which they’re held, are going to be based on asset treatment, privacy, tax treatment, asset protection and more.  – Adam Blumberg, Interaxis  Keep Reading  Fresh off the press, NASDAQ just released a report on the state of global regulation and crypto.  The XRP token is NOT a security when sold to the public, according to a ruling by Manhattan judge in June. The SEC doesn’t agree with the ruling, so it may not be settled yet, but the markets responded favourably to the ruling.  Is the SEC shifts focus from crypto for the next shiny object: AI?

15870987,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546625,1691679612,"Aptos (APT) Volume Remains Extremely High, More Gains Ahead?","On-chain data shows the Aptos (APT) trading volume has continued to be extremely high after the rally, a possible sign that more gains may be coming. Aptos Social Dominance Calms Down, But Trading Volume Remains Elevated Yesterday, news came out that tech giant Microsoft has partnered up with Aptos Labs to work on blockchain-based AI tools. This big announcement naturally caused a reaction in the market, as the company’s token, APT, observed a very sharp 17% jump. The token had neared the $8 level at the peak of this surge, but since then, it has observed some decline and has retreated towards the $7.3 mark. The below chart displays how the asset’s price has changed recently. Looks like the price of the asset has observed a sharp jump during the past day | Source: APTUSD on TradingView Despite the pullback, though, Aptos is still carrying gains of around 9%. These profits make it by far the best performer among at least the top 100 assets by market cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Surges, Recovery Being Driven By US Investors? As for why the retrace may have occurred, data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment could provide some hints. As displayed in the below graph, the social dominance of APT had observed a very large spike as the rally had taken place. The data for the different metrics related to APT | Source: Santiment on X The “social dominance” basically tells us how much discussion related to the top 100 assets on social media is coming from talks related to Aptos alone. When the news had broken out, social media discussion around the coin had naturally blown up, as a large number of users had become interested in the asset. While such excitement can help fuel a rally, too much of it can actually have the opposite effect. It would appear that the FOMO spiking in the market is what contributed to the rally topping out and the price decline. Since then, though, the social dominance has calmed down a bit, implying that hype has returned to healthier levels. At the same time, the APT trading volume (that is, the measure of the total number of tokens being moved around on the blockchain) has only gone up and has hit its highest point since March. This implies that investors have only continued to trade more of the cryptocurrency even after the rally’s pullback. Generally, a high amount of volume is needed to sustain any significant move in the price, as such moves require a large amount of fuel. Since the trading volume has only been growing, it can be one of the first hints that the Aptos rally isn’t over just yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retraces Back From $30,000 As Profit Taking Spikes In the chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another indicator, the development activity. This metric keeps track of the work that the developers have been doing on the project’s public GitHub repositories. From the graph, it’s visible that this metric had been constantly rising in the buildup to the announcement as the developers may have been preparing for the partnership.

Just over $10 million was bridged, or transferred, to the new blockchain in the past 24 hours, according to data in a Dune Analytics dashboard, with just over 15,000 new users and 40% fewer transactions than Wednesday.  Of that amount, $5.6 million was in the form of ether (ETH), $2.3 million in USD coin (USDC) and the rest was a plethora of alternative cryptocurrencies.  Read more: Coinbase Exec: ‘There’s No Playbook’ for Public Company Launching Blockchain  Wallet analysis shows most Base users transferred between $500 to $1,000 worth of ether on average. The biggest wallet to bridge, “0xcc...1763,” has transferred $17 million of tokens.  Base went live at 12 p.m. ET (16:00 UTC) on Wednesday, marking the first time a publicly traded company has released its own blockchain.  Why the slow day?  A reason for the slow first day could be that most investors who wanted to bridge to Base did so before the official launch — namely, by finding out a deposit address meant for developers and using it to pour money into “sh**coins” instead.  In late July, the issuance of viral meme coin bald (BALD) saw traders jump in ahead of the official launch in the search for outsized returns, sending over $66 million via a one-way bridge to Base.  The lure of meme-coin fortunes — such as BALD, which jumped 4,000,000% before collapsing — in a starved market likely helped Base attract $68 million in ether in less than 48 hours. At the time, Base ended up recording over $200 million in trading volume and more transactions than popular networks such as Arbitrum over the weekend.  Despite outsiders' worries about rug pulls and scams, Coinbase is amping up efforts to draw users to and generate revenue from the new network.  The exchange kicked off “On-chain Summer,” a virtual event, on Wednesday in celebration of Base’s mainnet launch. It features more than 50 brands, including Coca-Cola (KO), Friends With Benefits, a social decentralized autonomous organization and others in events that will run through the end of August.  Coinbase is also encouraging users to transfer their ether to Base in order to mint a free non-fungible token to commemorate the launch of the Base mainnet. According to data from Etherscan, more than 125,000 individuals have minted more than 30 million free NFTs so far.

A timely intervention by a deep-pocketed investor, an anonymous whale, has breathed new life into the frog-themed token, giving it a shot in the arm. In the unpredictable flow of the crypto space, the influence of well-to-do cryptocurrency whales has come into focus. These influential investors hold the power to sway market dynamics, often leaving smaller traders in their wake. The recent resurgence of PEPE is a striking illustration of the impact these whales can exert. Related Reading: Cardano False Breakdown: Could It Set The Stage For A 26% Climb? According to Lookonchain’s data, a substantial investment of 1 million USDC secured a staggering 807 billion PEPE tokens, all acquired at an ostensibly modest price of $0.000001239 per token. This calculated move was spurred by a noticeable surge in PEPE’s market valuation. A whale spent 1M $USDC to buy 807B $PEPE at $0.000001239 7 hrs ago after the price of $PEPE increased.https://t.co/P03KsDrzFi pic.twitter.com/0hjW6ewDjp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 9, 2023 Whales: Catalysts Of PEPE’s Reawakening Notably, such substantial investments serve not only as a financial injection but also as a confidence boost within the PEPE community. The actions of this anonymous whale have ignited a renewed sense of hope, accentuating the noteworthy role that these influential figures play in steering the course of the cryptocurrency landscape. As PEPE tries to go up, there’s an important point coming up: the 50-day moving average resistance. This point is really important because it shows how strong PEPE is and where it might go next. If PEPE can go past this point, it could start climbing even more, bringing lots of positivity and interest to PEPE. PEPE sees a slight increase in price. Chart at TradingView.com CoinGecko data currently places PEPE’s price at $0.00000124, down 1.5% in the last day, but managed to sustain a weekly gain of 2.3%. These measured yet consistent advances underscore the inherent resilience that PEPE continues to exhibit, even in the face of broader market fluctuations. Source: Coingecko PEPE & Community Engagement’s Impact Lunarcrush’s data cited in a recent price analysis demonstrates a 1.9% increase in social interactions and an impressive surge of 28.25% in social mentions. This surge in online discussions underscores the vital role that community engagement plays in shaping the trajectory of meme coins like PEPE. Further enhancing the narrative, weighted sentiment, a pivotal marker of market sentiment, has recently experienced an upward swing. This shift indicates a heightened degree of positivity surrounding PEPE in online dialogues. Such shifts in sentiment often foreshadow broader market movements, potentially setting the stage for a notable resurgence of the token.

This pattern has repeated 3 times in BTC history. Value investing and all other investing philosophies are simply subsets of pattern recognition, because you could not develop the philosophy without recognizing its patterns. To deny pattern recognition as a basis for an investment because it violates or goes against a subset of pattern recognition (value investing, etc.) is a logic fail. The more undeniable the pattern becomes, the more the market prices it in, and the lower the future return will be. This is the basis for the ""diminishing returns"" theory in crypto, which is that every cycle will produce a lower % return than the last one. The 4-year cycle is not priced in. Most people are either unaware, think it will not repeat, or think that other tools like technical analysis are more relevant than just looking at where we are in the cycle. Evident Cyclicality Running in 4-Year Cycles, with 3 Years Green, Followed by 1 Year Red The Bitcoin (BTC-USD) four-year cycle theory is being further substantiated with every 4 years that passes. We have had 3 clear 4-year cycles following the same pattern of 3 years up, followed by year down, since 2011. See annual returns for the 4-year periods of 2011-2014, 2015-2018, and 2019-2023 below. Bitcoin Returns by Calendar Year Year Return 2011 1467% 2012 187% 2013 5870% 2014 -61% 2015 35% 2016 124% 2017 1338% 2018 -73% 2019 94% 2020 302% 2021 60% 2022 -64% 2023 YTD 75% Source: Bankrate Bitcoin Price History Pattern recognition is essential for success in almost all human endeavors, including investing. Sir John Templeton once famously said ""the four most dangerous words in investing are, it's different this time."" The pattern in the historical annual price data is clear, and the burden of proof is on the bears to explain why this 12-year pattern would be break down this time. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would not be in my wheelhouse as a value investor, but there is no other asset class with such an undeniably clear pattern in its price movement. All Investment Philosophies Are Built on Pattern Recognition Many value investors object to Bitcoin on the basis that it does not produce a cash flow today and will never produce a cash flow. On this basis you must also reject investments in all commodities, watches, cars, art, housing for your primary residence, and land. If you have a problem with these, perhaps have a word with every bank that has a commodity trading floor. What many investors fail to recognize is that value investing, growth investing, special situations investing, arbitrage, passive index fund investing, and all other forms of investing are simply subsets of pattern recognition. You buy undervalued stocks because you or somebody else recognized that stocks have a pattern of reverting to cash flow multiples or other earnings multiples that are similar to those of their peers. You buy the S&P 500 index because you recognized that although it fluctuates, there has been a sustained pattern of 10% average nominal returns. You buy growth stocks because you recognized a pattern of big names that grew revenue and net income very quickly, and delivered outsized returns (Tesla, META, Google, Netflix, SHOP, etc.). To deny pattern recognition as a basis for an investment because it violates or goes against a subset of pattern recognition (value investing, etc.) is a logic fail. Value investing could not exist without groups of people identifying patterns that led to the creation of the value investing philosophy. To deny pattern recognition as a basis for an investment is to deny value investing itself and all other investing philosophies. Is There Enough Data to Confirm that the Pattern will Continue in the Future? If you recognize that there is a clear 4-year pattern in the price movement of Bitcoin, and that pattern recognition is a sufficient reason to warrant an investment, you might still say that three 4-year cycles over 12 years is not enough data to indicate that the pattern will continue into the future. This is a fair point, but the problem is that the more clear and undeniable the pattern becomes, the more the market prices it in, and the lower the return will be. This is the basis for the ""diminishing returns"" theory in crypto, which is that every cycle will produce a lower % return than the last one. This theory has been true across all 3 cycles so far. If you invested in 2011, you had no annual price data to base a pattern in, and your risk was the highest. As such, you gained the % returns over the first cycle. If you waited until the beginning of 2015, you had one 4-year cycle behind you, but there is no world in which you could call a sequence of one cycle a pattern. You wouldn't even be able to describe it as a ""cycle."" If you waited until the beginning of 2019, you now had two 4-year cycles behind you, and while it's not enough to be certain, you had enough data to form a theory. Your gains for holding from 2019 to the end of 2021 were much lower than those of somebody who held from 2015 to the end of 2017, because you had more information and your risk was lower. If you are still not invested and waited until 2023, you now have three 4-year cycles behind you. It's still not enough to be certain, but you wouldn't be certain with four or five 4-year cycles either. If you keep waiting until the point that you reach certainty or near certainty, your upside will be capped accordingly. And ironically, by the time everybody is certain the cycles will continue, that is when the market has priced the cycles in, which is when the cycles will cease to exist. Halving and 4-Year Cycles are Not Priced in The rationale for the halving and 4-year cycles not being priced in are quite simple. Firstly, you still have tons of people using technical analysis as a tool to tell whether or not to be bullish or bearish on Bitcoin, as if technical analysis has any use at all compared to just looking at where we are in the cycle. Secondly, we know that the market does not accept the 4-year cycle theory as fact yet. If it did, nobody would have sell ratings on Bitcoin at this point in the cycle, and nobody in the comment section of this article or other Bitcoin articles would have bearish comments. Some might say we are up 75% YTD; isn't that the market pricing in the halving? If we look at returns of pre-halving years in previous cycles, being up 75% would not indicate the halving being priced in. BTC was up 35% in pre-halving year 2015 and up 94% in pre-halving year 2019, and in both occasions BTC went up over 100% in the following halving year. What's Different this Cycle: Bitcoin ETF Filings Every time somebody has called for a cycle to be different from the last ones, they have been wrong. So I am not going to be one of those geniuses who calls for some ""super-cycle"" that extends into 2026 and beyond. Incoming institutional demand was a narrative in the peak of the last cycle, but now it is clear that institutions are interested and willing to participate and bring demand to the market. There has been news of the recent various BTC ETF applications from BlackRock, WisdomTree, Fidelity, Invesco, Valkyrie Investments, Ark Invest, and VanEck. The Bitcoin story remains the same. Demand is increasing over the years as the younger generation gains more financial resources and allocates it to their asset class of choice, while supply remains stable. Institutions are entering, not exiting. It's Very Difficult for a Commodity to go to Zero Bitcoin bears and critics often say that Bitcoin is worthless, and ""going to zero."" This is also sometimes repeated by some Bitcoin bulls like Chamath Palihapitiya, who say that Bitcoin is a binary investment that either goes to millions of dollars or to zero. The reality is it's much easier for an equity or a currency to go to zero or near zero than it is for Bitcoin or another commodity. With a currency, you have consistent inflation and debasement that sends the currency to near zero over the super-long term. With equities, you have the possibility of bankruptcy which can suddenly wipe out equity holders and certain levels of bond-holders. COVID-19 put a serious strain on the cryptocurrency narrative that it was a hedge against the traditional financial system. How could it be if the asset class fell many times harder than the stock market? If COVID couldn't send Bitcoin to zero, then I can't see what the catalyst to zero would be. What Would Change my Outlook There is a risk that the 4-year cycles break down or do not continue into the future. Since the bull thesis is based on taking advantage of the clear pattern and its predictability of timing of returns, a breakdown in the pattern would cause me to re-evaluate my thesis. If either 2023, 2024, or 2025 ends up being a down year, this would be a break in the pattern of 4-year cycles. A Final Word I do not hold Bitcoin directly; you can read more about my type of preferred cryptocurrency investment vehicle in my previous article on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which trades at a discount to NAV (net asset value). There are other cryptocurrency funds/trusts that trade at substantially higher discounts that I hold in my portfolio, that I will write about in future articles. I have also recently moved to Puerto Rico to take advantage of its 0% capital gains tax rate on equities and cryptocurrencies as a part of the Act 60 program. The crypto community is quite strong here and is similar to the one in Miami. I would advise crypto investors expecting significant gains in the projected 2024 and 2025 bull market to speak with tax professionals to see if the program makes sense for you.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4626172-basic-pattern-recognition-makes-you-a-bitcoin-bull?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15868430.jpeg

The impacted tokens will no longer be available to trade by the end of August. Bitstamp Moves To Suspend Tokens According to the announcement, several prominent cryptocurrencies will soon be blocked, rendering US-based users unable to trade them. These include Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), Chiliz (CHZ), Near Protocol (NEAR), Polygon (MATIC), The Sandbox (SAND), and Solana (SOL). As per the company’s announcement, after delisting the above-mentioned cryptocurrencies, the platform will offer only 30 listed cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency exchange urged users to execute all trades involving these tokens by the 29th of August, following which they will become unavailable. “Update for our US users Starting the 29th of August: AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL trading will be halted after evaluating recent market developments. Execute any open trades. Holding and withdrawing tokens afterwards will be unaffected.” According to the exchange, US trading of the tokens will be permanently disabled after the 29th of August. However, customers can still withdraw and hold the tokens after the date. “We kindly request our users to promptly execute any desired buy or sell orders involving the affected assets before the 29th of August, 2023. After this deadline, trading activities related to AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL will be permanently disabled on the Bitstamp platform.” “Recent Developments” Led To Decision The announcement pointed at recent market developments as the reason behind the suspension of trading of the cryptocurrencies mentioned. While the firm did not provide a concrete reason, all of the tokens mentioned in the announcement have been alleged to be unregistered securities by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Securities and Exchange Commission identified the cryptocurrencies in question as unregistered securities in separate complaints against Binance and Coinbase. However, Bitstamp has not delisted other assets mentioned in the cases against Binance and Coinbase. These assets include Nexo (NEXO), Algorand (ALGO), and Cardano (ADA). Other Platforms Have Also Delisted Assets The allegations against the tokens made by the Securities and Exchange Commission have yet to be proven in a court of law. However, other platforms have voluntarily delisted specific assets mentioned by the SEC in the cases. In recent months, several platforms, including Bakkt, Robinhood, and Revolut, have delisted Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). The platforms seem to have delisted these three cryptocurrencies because they are among the largest assets which the SEC targets. Following the developments, projects such as The Sandbox have also started mandating Know Your Customer (KYC) verification for SAND staking. According to the SEC, a total of 68 cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities. Crypto Projects Reject Claims However, cryptocurrency projects have repeatedly rejected the claims made by the Securities and Exchange Commission, either directly or indirectly. The Solana Foundation, in a statement, has said that it categorically disagrees with the SEC’s observations. Cardano’s parent company IOHK has also denied ADA’s security status. Meanwhile, Polygon Labs has said its operations were focused outside the US, beyond the reach and jurisdiction of the SEC. From the looks of things, it appears that actions taken around the assets in question are precautionary, and it remains to be seen if the SEC will take any action against the tokens or platforms in the future. SEC Action Against Binance And Coinbase The Securities and Exchange Commission’s suits against Coinbase and Binance have led to an uncertain future for major listed tokens. The regulatory body’s two lawsuits against the crypto exchanges in question have cast a long shadow on the 19 tokens mentioned in both filings.

Like all DEXs, PancakeSwap relies on smart contracts instead of middlemen to process trading, lending and lottery services for users. It was already on the BNB Chain, Ethereum, Polygon zkEVM, zkSync and Aptos blockchains.  The DEX held over $1.54 billion worth of tokens as of Wednesday, DefiLlama data shows.  Deployment on Arbitrum will provide lower fees and faster transactions for PancakeSwap users. Users can currently trade with fees of as low as 0.01%, one of the lowest among DEXs.  Arbitrum locks over $2 billion worth of tokens and is among the most popular layer 2 networks.  “PancakeSwap’s decision to launch on Arbitrum One reflects its commitment to driving mass adoption of DeFi,” Chef Cocoa said. “With the utmost scalability and cost-effectiveness, PancakeSwap aims to attract a wider audience to the exchange and facilitate broader participation in the DeFi ecosystem.”  PancakeSwap's native token cake (CAKE) is little changed over the past 24 hours and trades at $1.50 as of European afternoon hours, CoinGecko data shows.",POSITIVE,CAKE,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | ARB | CAKE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/09/pancakeswap-dex-deploys-on-ethereum-scaling-network-arbitrum-in-expansion-drive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2552ede43564bbca7e61a996c4ab7463fd04b77-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409990,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRDfI,1691673300,"After Co-Founding Salesforce’s Web3 Studio, Mathew Sweezey Is Bullish on Smart Tokens","Mathew Sweezey, co-founder of Salseforce's Web3 Studio, is joining Smart Token Labs as chief strategy officer  Sweezey believes the ERC-5169 token standard, or smart tokens, can help onboard more users to Web3  After ushering the leading cloud-software company into Web3, Mathew Sweezey is bullish on digital ownership. But instead of using traditional non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to do so, he’s leveraging another emerging blockchain technology – smart tokens.  Sweezey, the former co-founder of the Salesforce Web3 Studio, is joining tokenization company Smart Token Labs as chief strategy officer, with the goal of bringing Ethereum-based smart tokens to the greater Web3 ecosystem. Sweezey joined Salesforce after the company acquired marketing technology firm Pardot, where he previously led research and education initiatives. He spent years in thought leadership at Salesforce, becoming a partner at the company’s Futures LAB think tank to explore new possibilities for technological exploration and implementation.  His new focus is on smart tokens, also known as the ERC-5169 token standard, which are digital assets that combine the functionality of NFTs and smart contracts. Unlike most NFTs, which commonly use ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token standards and can represent ownership of a digital asset like art, smart tokens can be used to carry out predetermined tasks, such as interacting with other wallets autonomously or transacting on a user’s behalf. The result is a more dynamic and interactive experience that can be utilized across industries.  Sweezey told CoinDesk that the NFT boom in 2021 was his own personal entry point into Web3 and sparked his interest in empowering digital ownership. However, when helping to onboard companies to Web3 at Salesforce, he noted that many firms were struggling to find long-term utility for NFTs.  While NFTs have made their way into industries like gaming, entertainment and event ticketing, the tokens themselves don’t have any inherent utility baked into their smart contract code. Instead, the token’s utility is determined by its creator after mint. For example, a person can mint an NFT representing a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert but it's up to the show's organizers to determine whether the NFT ticket has any broader value, like being used to access the event.  Smart tokens are meant to enhance NFTs through the addition of smart contract functionality, taking them from static collectibles to active tools in a decentralized ecosystem. For example, in the realm of blockchain gaming, a smart token could serve as a character in a game and be programmed to complete quests independently.  As Sweezey delved deeper into learning about smart tokens, Sweezey found Smart Token Labs, which helps businesses tokenize loyalty and membership experiences. Smart Token Labs previously partnered with electric vehicle company Karma Automotive to tokenize car ownership, providing holders services including car registration, insurance and club membership on the blockchain.  Sweezey told CoinDesk that in his new role at Smart Token Labs, he hopes to highlight how smart tokens can help onboard more users to Web3 by removing the technical barriers to entry, such as opening a crypto wallet. He explained that smart tokens can live on or off-chain, in an Apple Wallet or an email address, which makes it easier for new users to enter the space without needing to first set up a crypto wallet.  “Once I saw the ability for a token to become an application, that's when my mind was blown,’” said Sweezey. “It wasn't until the concept of the smart token – which is frictionless, has the ability to become an application and the ability for it to be claimed and used in the Web2 world but then be backed up by the power of Web3 technology – that's when the lights turned on.”  Smart Token Labs helps provide the infrastructure for companies to enter Web3 through tokenization. It uses its native Smart Layer network to help businesses build their own smart tokens and create composable, or interoperable, digital experiences.  “What I really hope to do is be able to help people understand how we use these types of technologies to create better experiences and better business efficiencies,” said Sweezey. “I can help us really move the world forward and past the current conversation about NFTs to a new conversation about just what is possible through digital experiences, and the concepts of Web3 will fade into the background.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/08/10/after-co-founding-salesforces-web3-studio-mathew-sweezey-is-bullish-on-smart-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8916a6357299a021b20e68b91baf218bfbf9f817-1778x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15867611,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546649,1691672457,"Whale Purchases $10 Million stETH In The past Day, Here Are Possible Reasons Why","The crypto verse has recently witnessed a massive splash as an unidentified entity dove deep into the Ethereum ecosystem. A recent report from Lookonchain reveals that in a span of 24 hours, the whale has purchased $10 million worth of Lido Staked Ethereum (stETH). The Big Purchase And Past Activities Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics firm, broke the news earlier today on their X (formerly known as Twitter) account revealing that a whale address was responsible for the withdrawal of 10 million Dai (DAI) from Maker. The smart whale withdrew 10M $DAI from @MakerDAO and bought 5,403 $stETH again at an average price of $1,851 6 hrs ago.https://t.co/rIWyjsfRpf pic.twitter.com/aGwmc46gmc — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 10, 2023 According to the firm, this withdrawal wasn’t without purpose as the whale used the funds strategically invested to purchase 5,403 Lido Staked Ethereum, each at an average price of $1,851. Related Reading: Lido’s ETH Deposits Reach Record High Amid Stagnant stETH Withdrawals For those tracing the activities of this whale, this isn’t a maiden voyage into the stETH seas. As reported by Lookonchain, this exact address recorded two hefty transactions on 24 July 2023. The first transaction saw the whale dispensing 5.17 million USD Coin (USDC) to acquire 2,802 stETH at a rate of $1,844 each. Not stopping there, the whale converted a subsequent 10 million USDC into 5,421 ETH, which was then fully transitioned to stETH. Possible Reasons For Buying stETH While the motives of crypto whales, just like their real-world counterparts, often remain beneath the surface and obscured from the prying eyes of small investors, given the nature of this particular whale’s stETH acquisitions, it’s plausible to hypothesize some reasons behind its latest move. Strategic staking could be a reason behind the whale’s $10 million stETH purchase. Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism through ETH 2.0 has opened doors for staking returns. Acquiring stETH, a representation of staked ETH, could be a strategic move by the whale to earn rewards while maintaining liquidity. Another plausible hypothesis could be speculation for price appreciation. It is worth noting that the whale might anticipate a significant price appreciation in the near future and investing a sizable amount can yield substantial returns if the price moves in the favored direction. Related Reading: Ethereum: Is Lido (LDO) Doomed To Repeat Three Arrows Capital’s Fate? Diversification of their portfolio can also be a possible reason behind the whale’s substantial stETH purchase, especially given the significant amounts of USDC previously deployed by the whale, so moving some of these holdings into stETH may be a calculated strategy to achieve diversification. However, despite the large buys, stETH hasn’t seen any significant movement. Particularly, the asset has only declined by 0.5% with a current trading price of $1,850.

42409981,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRDI9,1691672400,4 Actual Use Cases for Blockchain and AI That Are More Than Just Hype,"Blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) are little more than bundles of computer networks and code, but they sure are becoming important players in nearly all aspects of online life.  An estimated 66% of the world’s population uses the internet for everyday activities like shopping, social connection, healthcare, business and entertainment. Additionally, at least 7 billion devices are connected to the internet through sensors and custom-designed software, comprising a growing cadre of gadgets referred to as the internet of things (IoT).  All this activity means one thing: data. Lots of data. As WIRED put it in 2014, data today is as valuable of a commodity as oil was in the 18th century. As of 2023, more than 11,000 marketing solutions exist simply to capture, track, analyze and report on consumer data to yield profitable insights.  Blockchain, an open-source globally distributed ledger, offers us a new place to store all that data where it might finally be independent of third-party companies that place profit incentives over consumer privacy. Yet, data on blockchain is publicly available by default – which is not ideal for most of our information. This transparency is causing many of us to think critically – perhaps for the first time – about what types of personal data we want to exist on the internet and how we should renegotiate Web2’s social contracts that have allowed centralized platforms like Facebook and Twitter to own our data in exchange for services.  That’s where artificial intelligence (AI) could come in. In an ideal future, third-party companies don’t track and analyze our data – AI does. Let’s imagine, in this ideal scenario, that we understand well enough how AI learning models work and therefore trust them to develop insights about who we are while tracking digital provenance and verifying the credibility of our information.  Sounds great, right? But unfortunately, most new AI use cases are still experimental and nobody can predict success. As happens with new technologies, the true capacities of AI and blockchain are currently getting lost in hyperbole, misunderstandings and FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). We spoke to several data experts and Web3 insiders to better understand where AI and Web3 might successfully converge to create consumer-friendly solutions for verification, ownership and creativity.  News verification  With the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, the issue of deep fakes and misinformation has become a grave concern. But what if we could publicly track the origin of information?  According to Lisa DeLuca, senior director of engineering at Web3 domain company Unstoppable Domains, not only does the source-tracking technology exist, but there’s also a way to link news quotes to the public key of the person who said it.  “We've got a pending patent for this idea that you can use blockchains to add trust to content,” DeLuca said. Similar to a Google Search Alert, a person could employ an AI bot to crawl the web for mentions of their name in the media. Any time that person is quoted by a journalist or news outlet, they would receive a request to verify the quote on the blockchain using their decentralized domain name linked to a crypto wallet.  “You'd see a request that says, ‘Is this really you – yes or no?’ And then the experience could be updated to show that that person verified it, and then the news outlet could develop their reputation over time on how much of their content is actually verified versus rejected,” explained DeLuca. The process could also be incentivized with crypto tokens so that the verifying person receives a reward for confirming their quotes.  According to DeLuca, Unstoppable Domains has already developed this tool and is ready to begin testing it with a media partner. “If someone wants to partner with us, we're ready to talk about it,” she said. “This is not that far off.”  Copyright and intellectual property protection  The digital world has long grappled with copyright infringement and intellectual property (IP) challenges. The convergence of Web3 and AI might be ushering in a new era of copyright protection.  Recently, comedian Sarah Silverman sued OpenAI and Meta over their AI models that were trained using her book, which is copyrighted material. While copyrighted materials often end up online and publically available, there ought to be ways for owners to regain control over their materials and dictate if, how and when they are used.  According to Don Gossen, CEO of data tokenization company Nevermined, the convergence of AI and blockchain could empower creators of all kinds to monetize their IP in terms they control. Smart contracts on the blockchain could automatically enforce copyright terms, while AI algorithms could scan content for potential infringements. This combined approach would create an immutable record of ownership and usage on the blockchain, simplifying disputes and incentivizing creators to share their work in a secure environment.  At present, Nevermined is testing this concept with scientific research, in a growing initiative known as decentralized science (DeSci). Using an AI learning model to compile data from lengthy research papers, programmers can create short-form abstracts for clinicians to quickly look up information in real-time healthcare settings. To maintain the integrity of the data, as well as compensate scientific authors, Gossen says that participating contributors could choose whether to include their copyrighted academic papers and research materials, thereby contributing to a well-curated dataset that produces high-quality outputs as a result.  Nevermined is currently working on a blockchain-based marketplace, in which AI developers would need to subscribe to get access to these materials and train their models. This approach gives the power to the original authors and owners of the content, who ultimately get to decide if they would like to grant others access to their materials.  Additionally, because blockchain can provide proof of reference, Gossen explained that a doctor could also deep dive into the original research to understand more, and possibly even reach out to the researchers.  “Commercially, this is useful because hospitals and clinics will pay for the abstracts for their medical professionals to access,” Gossen said. “A doctor can excuse themselves from the patient meeting, go to the back office and query the symptoms, receive a bunch of research, and then have five minutes to synthesize the information and go back to the patient with an assessment.”  Interactive NFTs: Enhancing digital collectibles  If you’ve ever wanted to create your own version of Clippy, the Windows paperclip that popped up inside Microsoft Word, now you can. When coupled with AI, the blockchain-based artworks known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can become more interactive and dynamic, unlocking a world of imagination and fun for creators, brands and consumers.  Alethea AI, the company behind intelligent NFTs (iNFTs), developed generative NFTs powered by large language models (LLMs), or deep learning algorithms that distill large data sets. It’s sort of like taking a version of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular chatbot, and combining it with your favorite digital artwork, thereby teaching the art to converse through text and verbal cues. That’s how Alethea AI’s generative NFTs work, and they can feature a holder’s favorite NFTs as avatars.  “Basically, how an iNFT is created is you take your NFT and combine it with what we call intelligence pods,” explained Komalika Neyol, Alethea AI content manager. “These pods are AI assets that can be trained. It can have a personality and perform AI services for you.""  According to Neyol, iNFTs are customizable to a user’s unique dataset, allowing holders to showcase their personalities, knowledge and skill sets through their NFT. For instance, a philosophy professor could upload their PhD dissertation to their LLM and create an animated chatbot that greets website visitors by quoting famous philosophers.  Interested users can create customized NFTs with their own unique dataset by minting an Alethea Intelligence Pod NFT. The company created a short tutorial video for holders on how to imbue an ERC-721 NFT with AI.  Smart contract security – with a caveat  In a future where smart contracts automatically divvy up and disperse payment to the appropriate crypto wallets as the experts we spoke to describe, auditing the security of smart contracts is going to be essential.  According to Ron Bodkin, co-founder and CEO of generative AI company ChainML, AI can be highly instrumental in detecting the anomalies of smart contracts. Chain ML is currently working with the Web3 security company Cube3 to more efficiently block malicious crypto transactions.  Similar to the safeguards implemented by a bank, programmers can train an AI to interpret factors that might be red flags, such as a suspicious origin of a transaction, the age of a wallet, the sequence of events (e.g. a prompt to drain a wallet right after interacting with a new address) and more.  “There's so many different factors that can come together to say, ‘Hey, this is risky, this is something that you want to deal with,’” said Bodkin.  However, Bodkin acknowledges that while AI can enhance the efficiency of blockchain security audits, humans are still necessary to conduct a thorough evaluation. His advice is to use AI technology in a way that improves human error, but don’t expect AI auditors to replace humans entirely.  “I wouldn't suggest anyone fire your auditor and just rely on AI audits,” Bodkin cautioned. He says ChainML and its partners are beginning to see success from performing AI audits earlier in the building process, thereby helping human auditors address problems quicker, but the process would not be possible with robots alone.  “AI auditors could run all the time and very quickly give responses,” Bodkin said. “There's a number of layers where AI can enhance security.”  Bottom line  The convergence of blockchain and AI presents a brave new world, one full of exciting possibilities that have the potential to reshape various sectors. News verification, copyright protection, interactive NFTs and smart contract audits are burgeoning areas that demonstrate the tangible benefits of this Web3-AI synergy.  However, while the possibilities are vast, experts advise businesses and creators to be careful and consider AI’s technological limitations. Presently, AI is about supplementing human productivity, improving error and expanding the imagination — and they’re unlikely to fully replace humans anytime soon.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/4-actual-use-cases-for-blockchain-and-ai-that-are-more-than-just-hype,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f50a268c9d5ead306e7bcbb7b4339adbbc80e867-1980x1114.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409984,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRDS4,1691672400,ChatGPT-Based Search Function Goes Live on Blockchain Encyclopedia IQ.wiki,"Blockchain encyclopedia IQ.wiki has started a search engine based on OpenAI's ChatGPT technology to enable crypto users to search through a wide variety of sources, according to a Thursday press release.  Crypto companies are increasingly integrating artificial intelligence (AI) functions in their products as the technology has captivated the general public and venture capitalists alike.  ""Reading through a 1,000 word encyclopedia entry to answer a question is difficult and time consuming for users, and the GPT-4 search engine solves that as users can simply ask a question,"" said Navin Vethanayagam, Chief Brain of IQ.wiki. ""At the same time, by making information search easier, the search engine, called IQ GPT, helps fight misinformation and makes onboarding easier for new traders,"" he added.  IQ GPT ""integrates a crypto domain-specific model of OpenAI’s GPT-4"" and has been trained on data from information platform CoinGecko, The Associated Press, Korean crypto news outlet CoinNess, Hong Kong government's InvestHK, decentralized finance (DeFi) content provider Flywheel DeFi, and IQ.wiki's repository of encyclopedia entries. It also has ongoing access to these sources.  The search engine includes the original source so that users are able to discern misinformation, Vethanayagam noted.  IQ.wiki started as Everipedia in 2014, which aimed to be a more open blockchain-based Wikipedia. In 2018, it received $30 million in funding from Galaxy Digital, said the Chief Brain.  In 2022, it changed its name to IQ.wiki and switched to crypto-only content. IQ.wiki was one of the first crypto projects to integrate AI technology back in February.  Every entry and edit on IQ.Wiki is recorded on the Polygon blockchain, which Vethanayagam says brings greater transparency.  The project has its own token, IQ, which is used to incentivize users to participate but also in governance. Users that stake the token can vote on governance decisions in the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages the encyclopedia.  ""Everyone in the DAO [decentralized autonomous organization] is going to have have controls over IQ GPT as well, and upcoming services,"" said Vethanayagam. In the next year, the encyclopedia plans to roll out more AI tools to ""scale crypto knowledge and education,"" he said in the press release.

42409996,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRDz8,1691671255,"SEC Likely to Approve Several Spot ETFs, Sparking Next Bitcoin Rally: Matrixport","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is likely approve several spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds in quick succession, triggering the next move higher for the world’s largest digital currency, crypto-services provider Matrixport said in a report Thursday.  The ETF providers would spend ""considerable marketing expenses to draw in retail and institutional capital,"" Markus Thielen, head of research, wrote.  Matrixport noted that at its peak, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) managed $43.5 billion in assets and generated annual management fees of $870 million.  The SEC will respond to Grayscale’s GBTC lawsuit filing and ARK 21Shares bitcoin ETF refiling, next week. The regulator is expected to respond to seven other bitcoin ETF filings during the first week of September.  ""A physical bitcoin ETF will likely carry a management fee of 0.7-1% which could still bring in $200m per annum for those ETF providers with marketing expenses front-loaded,"" the report said.  The note said that any SEC spot ETF approval could have a “material positive impact” on bitcoin's price, and investors should have enough “upside exposure” on any day that the regulator is scheduled to respond to the ETF applications.  If the SEC needs more time to assess the practicality of the surveillance-sharing agreements, then the bitcoin price may correct initially in mid-September, and this is the “dip to buy,” the report added.

42409978,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRDBX,1691671213,U.S. July CPI Matches Estimates With 0.2% Monthly Growth,"The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% in July from June, in line with economists' forecasts and the same as the monthly growth in June. On a year-over-year basis, CPI rose 3.2%, compared with forecasts of 3.3% and June's figure of 3.0%.  Core CPI — which strips out volatile food and energy costs — also rose 0.2% in July, the same as forecasts and as June's increase. Core CPI in July rose 4.7% from a year earlier, versus a 4.8% forecast and 4.8% in June.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) was little changed in the minutes following the Bureau of Labor Statistics' report at $29,550.  The figures may have increased the chances the Federal Reserve won't raise interest rates at its next meeting in September. Prior to the report, the CME FedWatch tool showed traders had priced in just a 15.5% chance of a rate hike next month. In the immediate aftermath of the report, those odds sank to 10%.  The Fed has been tightening its monetary policy since early last year to combat galloping inflation, raising its benchmark fed-funds rate target more than 500 basis points over the past 17 months to the current range of 5.25% to 5.50%.  The surge in interest rates played at least a part in bitcoin's tumble from more than $69,000 in late 2021 to just above $16,000 at the end of 2022. Continuing rate worries this year have likely played a part in capping bitcoin's bounce. To the extent that the latest CPI report confirms expectations that the Fed may back off of rate hikes, it could be bullish at the margin for bitcoin.  As measured by the CPI, annual inflation topped out at 9.1% in June 2022 and has mostly steadily declined since. Core CPI peaked at 6.5% in March 2022 and has dropped as well, though not as dramatically as the headline number. The Fed's target rate for inflation is 2%, but members of the central bank have indicated that they don't need to see that figure before deciding to end the monetary-tightening cycle.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/10/us-july-cpi-mostly-in-line-rising-02-for-month-32-yy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af4082b67533d9cb37ee4e3a1dcd23136e7de3e4-1439x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance announced the news after the platform received two licenses from the Central American Nation, according to a statement released on the 8th of August. Licensed Bitcoin Services Provider In El Salvador According to a statement released by the exchange, Binance became the first fully licensed crypto exchange to operate in El Salvador after it received the two licenses required. The two licenses in question are the Bitcoin Services Provider License (BSP) given by the Central Reserve Bank (Banco Central de Reserva) and the Digital Assets Services Provider License (DASP) provided by the National Commission of Digital Assets ((Comisión Nacional de Activos Digitales). According to Binance, the approval is another step in the exchange’s growing efforts to get licenses and permissions in key markets around the world. With this latest approval, Binance has approvals and registrations in 18 global markets, including Italy, Spain, France, Sweden, and Dubai. Binance General Manager for Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean, Daniel Acosta, stated, “These licenses allow Binance to expand the products and services offered, including options tailored to the needs of our customers in El Salvador. It is also a great opportunity to collaborate closely with government authorities to support the adoption of crypto assets in the country, foster financial inclusion, innovation, and ensure customer protection.” Speaking about the developments, the Binance Head of Latin America, Min Lin, stated, “We are honored to be granted this license as Binance continues to work collaboratively with regulatory agencies around the world to support global standards for the crypto and blockchain industry. This announcement comes after many months of dedication from our team to provide all information and proceed with the necessary due diligence required by the agencies, showcasing our commitment to the Salvadoran market and our users.” El Salvador And Crypto El Salvador, under President Nayib Bukele, has maintained an extremely welcoming posture towards crypto, especially Bitcoin. In fact, the country had given Bitcoin the status of legal tender as far back as 2021. The country has also been on a Bitcoin acquisition spree and has so far acquired over 2300 BTC, according to data sourced from Buy Bitcoin Worldwide. According to current prices, the value of El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserves is estimated to be around $70 million. Additionally, the government of El Salvador has also introduced several pro-crypto and pro-Bitcoin measures, such as a bill allowing the country to sell bonds that are backed by Bitcoin. However, despite these measures, reports have suggested that crypto adoption in the country remains low, as citizens question the long-term benefits of crypto adoption. Earlier this year, Bitfinex announced that it had become the first fully regulated digital assets exchange to receive a DASP license in El Salvador. Binance Increases Global Presence Despite the exchange facing numerous regulatory headaches across a number of jurisdictions, Binance has managed to expand its global footprint further. After receiving its operating licenses in El Salvador, Binance has become the most widely licensed crypto platform and now has approvals and registrations in over 18 countries around the world. These include countries such as Japan, Sweden, Dubai, France, Italy, and several others. However, the exchange has also faced several setbacks, having exited several prominent markets such as Cyprus, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The exchange had to exit these markets after it failed to get the required regulatory approval to continue operations. Binance is also facing several regulatory challenges in the US, with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charging the exchange of failing to comply with local laws and regulations.

However, despite these measures, reports have suggested that crypto adoption in the country remains low, as citizens question the long-term benefits of crypto adoption. Earlier this year, Bitfinex announced that it had become the first fully regulated digital assets exchange to receive a DASP license in El Salvador. Binance Increases Global Presence Despite the exchange facing numerous regulatory headaches across a number of jurisdictions, Binance has managed to expand its global footprint further. After receiving its operating licenses in El Salvador, Binance has become the most widely licensed crypto platform and now has approvals and registrations in over 18 countries around the world. These include countries such as Japan, Sweden, Dubai, France, Italy, and several others. However, the exchange has also faced several setbacks, having exited several prominent markets such as Cyprus, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The exchange had to exit these markets after it failed to get the required regulatory approval to continue operations. Binance is also facing several regulatory challenges in the US, with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charging the exchange of failing to comply with local laws and regulations.

42419756,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFnUj,1691670440,"UK Crypto Incentives Ban Could Drive Firms Out of Country, Lobbyists Say","Lobby group CryptoUK said a planned ban on crypto incentives by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) could drive businesses out of the country.  The FCA in June published new crypto promotions rules for the sector and a consultation on guidance.  CryptoUK is calling for clarity on what counts as a “qualifying crypto asset” and “financial promotion.”  A crypto industry group in the U.K. is concerned that a proposed ban on incentives could drive businesses out of the country.  The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in June published its planned regulatory regime for crypto advertisements and promotions for public comment. The regulator proposed a ban on crypto incentives. The distribution of free non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and airdrops as incentives to encourage investment would be banned under the new regime, the FCA told CoinDesk at the time. The new promotions regime is set to take effect on Oct. 8.  ""Whilst members acknowledge that the rules have been extended to the crypto asset industry to minimize consumer detriment, the FCA should keep in mind that certain aspects of the rules (such as incentive bans) may make it challenging for firms to be commercial and competitive and may cause the unintended consequence of forcing firms to move their operations out of the U.K.,"" said lobby group CryptoUK in response to the FCA’s proposals on Wednesday.  The government passed a financial markets bill into law in June that brought crypto promotions into the FCA's remit and the watchdog has since said it aims to treat risks with the appropriate regulatory approach.  ""Crypto remains high-risk and the new rules are aligned with the existing rules for promoting other high-risk investments. We’ve conducted extensive consumer research, behavior testing and considered responses to both our discussion and consultation paper on the matter,"" an FCA spokesperson said in an email to CoinDesk. ""These rules are designed to be proportionate, evidence-based and strike the right balance between protecting people and enabling sustainable innovation in the sector.”  Read more: Free Promotional NFTs, Crypto Airdrops Would Be Banned Under New UK Rules, Official Says  More clarity on guidance  Though the lobby group generally agreed that crypto adverts should be “fair, clear and not misleading,” as the FCA sets out, it said the regulator's guidance on the rules needed more clarity.  CryptoUK members asked for more clarity on what counts as a financial promotion, what promotions activities outside the U.K. would be monitored, and if the FCA will set out what other jurisdictions' laws would be equivalent to its own so that international companies don't have to adjust to the new ad rules, the letter said.  “The guidance is limited in nature and does not take into account the specific nuances related to qualifying crypto assets and how these products are marketed through different channels,” CryptoUK said in its letter. “We consider the guidance should be expanded and provide more detailed examples that set out FCA’s expectations along with how it applies to the crypto asset market.”  The lobby group also said that the term “qualifying crypto assets” is open to interpretation and called for clarity on what falls into its scope.

42419777,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFnoL,1691669927,First Mover Americas: Coinbase Seeks New Revenue Stream From Layer 2 Network,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Coinbase (COIN), the large publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange, said its new Base blockchain, a ""layer 2 network,"" has gone live, heralding the start of a new era of public companies running their own distributed networks. Base was already live for testing by developers, and it became open to the public at noon ET on Wednesday. The move could ultimately allow Coinbase to garner fees from running its own blockchain, in addition to a potentially even more lucrative stream of revenue from applications built atop it, executives say. Layer 2 networks are built atop base ones, relieving congestion on the underlying network. Base is built upon the Ethereum blockchain.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will file an ""interlocutory appeal"" of a judge's ruling on Ripple's programmatic sales of XRP, the regulator said in a court filing on Wednesday. The SEC said it was seeking to ""leave to"" appeal part of a recent decision while other parts of the SEC's case proceed to trial. The regulator said approval of an appeal could prevent the SEC and government from needing two trials. The SEC sued Ripple in 2020 on grounds that it was selling an unregistered security. Last month, a federal judge ruled that Ripple's programmatic sales — where it listed XRP on exchanges for anyone to purchase — weren't securities transactions, whereas Ripple's direct sales to institutional clients were.  Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said Wednesday she’s “deeply concerned that payments giant PayPal (PYPL) is launching its own stablecoin without federal rules for stablecoins in place. Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Service Committee, noted that PayPal has 435 million customers around the world, more than the number of online accounts of all the largest banks combined. “Given PayPal’s size and reach, federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential in order to guarantee consumer protections and alleviate financial stability concerns,” Waters wrote.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows market-implied probabilities of the fed-funds rate, or the benchmark borrowing cost, over different time frames.  Ahead of Thursday's release of the Consumer Price Index, futures activity tells us that the Federal Reserve is done raising rates and is likely to begin the easing cycle early next year.  A hotter-than-expected CPI may dent dovish Fed expectations and inject volatility into markets.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Early Base Whales Have an Affinity for Meme Tokens, Nansen Says  France Steps Closer to Implementing MiCA for Crypto Firms  SEI Token Could Reach Nearly Half a Billion Market Cap on Binance Debut",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/10/first-mover-americas-coinbase-seeks-new-revenue-stream-from-layer-2-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c973755cd7d24898a2cb53e1ef1b0ec16819aad-1056x594.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419760,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFnXp,1691669309,FTX Fires Back at Creditors 'Willing to Gamble Estate Assets on Higher Returns',"Lawyers for FTX have fired back at creditors who criticized the bankrupt estate's proposed reorganization plan.  FTX's administration alleges the creditors are ""willing to gamble estate assets on higher returns"" regardless of the potential impact on other stakeholders.  Administrators of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX fired back in a Wednesday court filing at a creditors' panel for criticizing the estate's reorganization plan.  The feud casts a shadow on the immediate future of negotiations taking place between stakeholders on a restructuring plan that is supposed to help recoup the roughly $8.1 billion FTX owes customers.  Disagreements emerged after a draft reorganization plan was submitted on July 31 by FTX’s new management team under CEO John Ray III. That same day, the official committee of unsecured creditors alleged the plan had ignored the its suggestions without ""a single call or meeting"" to discuss the terms of plan.  FTX administrators hit back at those allegations in Wednesday's filing, saying that the plan was criticized ""mere moments"" after it was submitted while the debtors had worked with the committee’s professionals over the ""course of many months"" to develop the draft plan and terms.  Citing 112 documents, dozens of calls, meetings and 779 hours in invoices of the committee’s legal advisers, the FTX administrators said to ""suggest otherwise is misleading in the extreme.""  ""While claiming a lack of engagement when the facts clearly demonstrate the opposite, the committee pleading actually foreshadows an inclination to pursue an unrepresentative plan that vests control of the debtors’ billions of dollars in liquid assets in the hands of unrestricted crypto traders and market makers regardless of the potential impact on other stakeholders,"" FTX lawyers wrote in the court filing, adding they were ""heavy with the weight of an unstated agenda specific to the individual members of the committee.""  In a footnote, the debtors wrote they are frustrated by the ""refusal of many committee members to meet in person (an in person meeting with the full committee has never occurred) as well as the unwillingness of certain members to appear on screen during Zoom calls.""  Gambling with estate assets  The FTX bankruptcy team, through its lawyers, also hit back at the compliant from the creditors' committee that the debtors had not invested in Treasury securities.  The lawyers argued that this would ""require relief from this court"" and that they would be faced with a separate risk of commingling of their Treasury investments, and the step ""creates a risk of loss in the event of a need for rapid monetization, or the lack of liquidity in the surety collateral market, which is not an idle concern given the recent bank failures allegedly caused in part by overinvestment in U.S. treasuries.""  ""The committee, populated by traders and market makers, may be willing to gamble estate assets on higher returns, but the debtors and their independent Board do not agree that such an approach is appropriate in favor of the potential for a slightly higher yield than the present situation where current collateralized deposits earn a weighted average rate of 3.88 percent and over $1.9 billion earn in excess of four per cent,"" the filing added.  FTX lawyers acknowledged that the members of the creditors' committee are experienced in certain aspects of the crypto industry, but not in restructuring.  ""The committee may be a statutory fiduciary for all unsecured creditors, but it is not representative of all of the various classifications of creditors, nor does the Committee reflect the views of all of the 1.9 million customers of the FTX.com exchange,"" the filing said.

In response, Democrat congresswoman Maxine Waters has raised palpable concerns that may or may not threaten the stablecoin’s operations. Waters Raises Regulatory Concerns Reacting to the news of Paypal’s PYUSD stablecoin launch, congresswoman Maxine Waters noted that the launch comes at a time when there was no legislative mechanism to regulate these assets. She stated that “given PayPal’s size and reach, federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential in order to guarantee consumer protections and alleviate financial stability concerns.” She further noted that “stablecoins represent the issuance of a new form of money, making it integral that there are federal guardrails.” Related Reading: Solana Beats Out Ethereum To Emerge As Best Performer In Terms Of TVL Waters’ recent comments are in contrast with those of the House Financial Services Committee Rep. Patrick McHenry, who had earlier lauded PayPal’s launch. According to him, the recent announcement was “a clear signal that stablecoin, if issued under a clear regulatory framework, holds promise as a pillar of our 21st century payment system” Last month, the US House Financial Services Committee also introduced a bill to set up a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, focusing on guidelines for registration and licensing for stablecoin issuers. Although stablecoins have been around for several years, they have not been able to enjoy significant attention within the mainstream consumer payment ecosystem. Similar efforts by popular non-cryptocurrency firms, such as Meta Platforms, to launch stablecoin services faced harsh resistance from policymakers and global financial regulators. In the face of regulatory uncertainty, it is always critical whenever a lawmaker has something to say about virtual currencies. PYPL price remains volatile amid regulatory concerns | Source: PayPal Holdings, Inc. on Tradingview.com PayPal To Expand Into The Growing Stablecoin Industry According to a report published on August 9 by popular market analyst Bernstein, the stablecoin industry is projected to reach a $2.8 trillion valuation in the next five years. This represents a whooping 22x increase from the present $125 billion valuation of the industry, and PayPal is looking to take advantage of this expected increase through its recent release of the PYUSD stablecoin. Related Reading: Billionaire Investor Wishes He Bought Bitcoin Early On, Here’s Why The leading payment giant revealed that the stablecoin will be “100% backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents.” The coins will be redeemable 1:1 for US dollars and issued by US-based Paxos Trust Co. Consumers will also be able to convert any crypto supported by PayPal to and from PayPal USD (PYUSD). However, aside from the current legislative tussle, PayPal will also face competition from existing players such as Tether and Circle. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC are the largest stablecoins, with market caps of over $83 billion and $26 billion, respectively.

Stakeholders Reluctant to Foot the Bill About a year ago, crypto market manipulator, Avi Eisenberg, had reportedly raided Mango Markets for over $100 million. He was arrested soon after confessing to the exploit, and the company has been pursuing legal action against him since then. However, the platform's stakeholders are now finding it difficult to cover the escalating legal costs. A proposal by Mango Labs, the company responsible for developing the Solana blockchain-based exchange, sought approval for an additional $2 million in funding for legal expenses.

Stakeholders Reluctant to Foot the Bill About a year ago, crypto market manipulator, Avi Eisenberg, had reportedly raided Mango Markets for over $100 million. He was arrested soon after confessing to the exploit, and the company has been pursuing legal action against him since then. However, the platform's stakeholders are now finding it difficult to cover the escalating legal costs. A proposal by Mango Labs, the company responsible for developing the Solana blockchain-based exchange, sought approval for an additional $2 million in funding for legal expenses. The proposal was put to a vote within Mango DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization overseeing the protocol. Initial voting results indicate that Mango DAO voters are hesitant to provide the requested funds.

42419759,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFnWn,1691663690,"Bitcoin Traders Should Watch Wider Inflation Metrics, Not Just CPI","Thursday's U.S. CPI release is important, but so are wider inflation metrics that point to a rebound in price pressures.  The possibility of a pickup in inflation means the Fed is likely to stay hawkish for some time. That could bring downside volatility in risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  As crypto and traditional market traders await the U.S. Consumer Price Index for July, some observers are focused on forward-looking metrics that suggest the potential for a rebound in inflation in months ahead, a scenario that could bring some pain to risky assets.  On Thursday at 12:30 UTC (8:30 ET), the U.S. Labor Department will release the July Consumer Price Index. Economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal estimate that the CPI rose 0.2% month-on-month in July, matching June's pace to signal a continued easing of inflation. The annualized rate is forecasted to have inched higher to 3.3%, predominantly due to base effects, according to the Journal. The core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy prices, is also forecast to have held steady at 0.2% in July from June and to have risen by 4.8% from a year earlier.  A monthly gain of 0.2% would be consistent with the moderation of inflation that Federal Reserve officials want to see, more so given its policy is now sufficiently restrictive at 5.25%, which means the borrowing cost is above CPI, core CPI and the bank's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures, or PCE.  So, traders may feel encouraged to scale up exposure to risky assets, including bitcoin (BTC), should the data match estimates, validating t dovish expectations in the market. Fed-funds futures show traders believe the Fed's rate hike cycle peaked in July and the central bank will cut rates next year.  Traders, however, are likely wrong in pricing rate cuts as forward-looking metrics point to stagflation ahead, Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, explained during CoinDesk's Twitter spaces event on Wednesday. The CPI data is backward-looking and exposed to base effects, which tend to hide the true picture.  While discussing the pending CPI release, Acheson noted that U.S. gasoline prices have surged to their highest level since October 2022 and cited an increase in the FOA Food Price Index. She also pointed to the need to replenish the dwindling U.S. petroleum reserves and its bullish impact on oil prices. The CPI is sensitive to changes in oil prices.  Acheson added that the Cleveland Fed nowcast has headline CPI for July at 0.41%, more than double the consensus forecast of 0.2%. The model suggests an uptick in the inflation rate to 0.6% in August. That would amount to an annualized CPI rate of 7.4%.  ""Stagflation is the worst possible scenario for risk assets, particularly for stocks,"" Acheson said, adding that compared to the situation with equities, the downside in bitcoin appears to be limited, considering current low participation from macro investors, the possibility that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund and bitcoin's gold-like appeal.  In a note to clients on Wednesday, analysts at ING said the latest uptick in bond market's expectations for price pressures suggests the Fed's inflation fight is not over yet and warned of continued elevated bond yields. Bitcoin has had an inverse relationship with U.S. bond yields.  The U.S. 5-year, 5-year forward inflation expectations rate jumped to a 16-month high of 2.53% early this week, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.  ""These are not awful levels when you consider where inflation was, and at least these expectations are still comfortably below 3%. But it’s the path they’ve been on that creates the issue, as that path has been pointing upwards. At the same time, there is an ongoing rise in food and energy prices in play, which risks adding to headline pressure down the line,"" the ING analysts wrote.  ""Given this backdrop, the U.S. 10yr has managed to remain above 4%, and we think it should continue to do so. And remember, once we get through tomorrow’s U.S. inflation report, we’ll likely see headline U.S. inflation closer to 3.5% than 3% and core U.S. inflation closer to 5% than 4%,"" the analysts added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | BTG,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/10/bitcoin-traders-should-watch-wider-inflation-metrics-and-not-just-cpi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/368526104f26728e3ceede51fb08d5da5f236db4-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

I believe this sentiment change bodes well for Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust and the NAV discount has closed considerably in recent weeks. With renewed TradFi interest, HODLers eating supply, and a halving event looming, a BTC supply crunch feels imminent. In what has been a fast-moving news cycle in the cryptocurrency market over the last several months, the recent launch of PayPal’s ( PYPL ) new ERC-20 token stablecoin might be one of the biggest signals we’ve received pertaining to TradFi adoption of public blockchain rails yet. As good as I think this is for Ethereum (ETH-USD) more broadly, I’m not actually as convinced PYUSD will provide an earnings tailwind PayPal’s actual business. I detailed my thinking on that in a previous article for Seeking Alpha that you can read here . What I didn’t focus on in that piece is what the PYUSD development could mean for the broader regulatory environment in the United States. By my count, PayPal’s stablecoin is the third major action since mid-June that seemingly undermines previous policy positions from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In June, Wall Street behemoth BlackRock ( BLK ) applied for a spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETF with the backdrop of an SEC that has denied every previous application to this point. In July, a US district judge ruled secondary sales of Ripple (XRP-USD) do not constitute unregistered securities sales in a lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the SEC. Though the agency is reportedly appealing that decision. And August has now brought the launch of a notable fintech branded USD-backed stablecoin that is being issued by the exact same firm that was given a Wells Notice earlier this year for what seems to be a fundamentally identical product. If we’re reading the tea leaves on this, we now have two major traditional financial firms seemingly rejecting the SEC’s positions on crypto-related policies. I don’t think this is a small deal and I believe it strengthens the viewpoint that Grayscale’s lawsuit with the SEC will result in a positive outcome for GBTC shareholders. Of course, this is all nothing more than pure speculation on my part and should be treated as such for whatever value that is worth to the reader. But there are other signs that I believe give credence to the bull thesis today. What We Know The enormous discount to net asset value for Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) shares has been a well-documented problem both here and through other outlets. In recent months, that NAV discount has started to close and the progress has been more stable in recent weeks. As of Tuesday August 8th, that discount is just 25.5% - this is up from a NAV discount of roughly 50% at the end of 2022: Data by YCharts Because of the discount closing, holding GBTC year to date has resulted in outperformance of over 5,800 basis points versus the underlying asset. Data by YCharts Bitcoin is up 79% year to date while GBTC is up over 137%. What's additionally encouraging is that related party holdings of GBTC are actually slightly higher than they were at the beginning of the year: Related Party Share Holdings As of 12/31/22 Current 10-Q Change GBTC 36,065,470 36,069,847 0.01% Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) 11,811,797 8,728,797 -26.10% Ethereum Classic Trust ( ETCG ) 3,258,770 3,002,894 -7.85% Litecoin Trust ( LTCN ) 1,296,956 1,126,498 -13.14% Bitcoin Cash Trust ( BCHG ) 1,786,273 1,443,441 -19.19% Source: Grayscale This means the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust is one of the few funds that Grayscale’s related parties have not been selling in recent quarters per the company's recent 10-Q filings. In the table above, I'm showing Grayscale's top five single asset funds by AUM. GBTC, ETHE, and ETCG 10-Qs are all as of Q2-23 while LTCN and BCHG are as of Q1-23. Of the top five funds, only GBTC has actually been acquired by related parties since the end of December rather than distributed. Bitcoin Supply Crunch Even if the NAV discount remains exactly where it is, there is a compelling argument to be made that GBTC will still move up with the underlying asset from here given the current supply setup for BTC. The level of Bitcoin ""hodling"" has reached unprecedented levels. As of August 7th, over 13.3 million BTC was held by long-term holders. Nearly 70% of the circulating supply is being hoarded according to data from IntoTheBlock: IntoTheBlock IntoTheBlock defines ""Hodlers"" as wallet addresses that have held bitcoin for more than a year and counts 33.3 million addresses as qualifying for that distinction. We can also see supply coming out of exchanges to a significant degree. Glassnode Per data from Glassnode, just under 2.3 million BTC is held on exchanges globally. This would be the lowest level of exchange BTC holdings in 5 years. It is generally interpreted as bullish for Bitcoin's short to medium term price when supply comes out of exchange addresses as it's an indication that speculators are committing to holding the asset rather than swapping it for fiat or other cryptos. LookIntoBitcoin And this is all with the next Bitcoin halving just 8 months away. When this happens, it means the block reward for mining BTC will be cut from 6.25 BTC per block to just 3.125 BTC per block. The point is, market participants appear to be loading up BTC in anticipation of this event. With less than a year before the halving and with traditional financial firms preparing to offer spot ETFs, it's difficult for me to see much more downside from here barring something catastrophic. Risks From where I sit, the biggest risk to GBTC at this juncture is the possibility that Grayscale could lose its lawsuit with the SEC. If that were to happen, I suspect traders who have been playing the NAV arbitrage will throw in the towel and that could depress the price of the fund shares further against the underlying asset. There is also risk in the related party holders. Digital Currency Group, Grayscale's parent company, is one of those related parties and that company has reportedly missed a $630 million dollar payment to one of its creditors. DCG could potentially become a forced seller of assets and that could also harm the GBTC share price even with a flat BTC. Finally, there is also underlying asset risk. If the price of BTC goes down significantly, it would be detrimental to the share price of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Summary There has been a noticeable shift in sentiment toward the regulatory environment in the United States. Traditional financial firms like BlackRock and PayPal are now doing things that the SEC has previously indicated were problematic from more crypto-native businesses just a few months ago. The crypto industry has been lamenting what has been viewed as a policy of regulation by enforcement under Gary Gensler's SEC. But recent developments in markets and in court seem to indicate the law may be on the side of the innovators after all. I think this is very bullish for Bitcoin and for GBTC shareholders as well. And I believe the on-chain metrics are screaming a supply crunch is upon us.",POSITIVE,BCH | ETC,BCH | ETC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4626547-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-reading-the-tea-leaves?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15862915.jpeg

42419770,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFni9,1691661696,Why Binance Is Abandoning Most of Europe,"Binance’s options in Europe seem to be narrowing as evidenced by a recent string of withdrawals and rejections from local regulators.  With the EU’s crypto regulation MiCA set to take effect in the next year or so, the firm only needs to be licensed in one member nation to serve all 27.  But some countries like France and Germany are more prepared for MiCA than others, and which EU countries crypto firms choose for compliance will matter, legal experts say.  If recent headlines are taken at face value, it looks like Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, could be exiting Europe.  The exchange, having survived a wave of crypto collapses in 2022, is now facing regulatory pressure from all directions, with the U.S. likely to strike the greatest blow. U.S. prosecutors are weighing charges against Binance, while multiple regulators have filed suit against the company and its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. He reportedly considered shutting down Binance’s U.S. unit in a bid to save the wider company.  Meanwhile, a string of rejections from EU regulators and voluntary withdrawals from several other markets gives the impression that Binance might be running out of options in Europe as well.  But with the EU’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation coming in, the exchange may simply be – contrary to Warren Buffet’s mantra on investing – putting all its eggs in one basket by focusing most or all of its efforts on compliance in fewer EU countries. And that just might be what it needs right now to succeed in Europe in the long term.  Companies looking to operate in the European Union had to register or get licensed in each jurisdiction, but that won’t be necessary when MiCA comes into effect in around 12 - 18 months.  “You have to apply for one license in one country. And then you get almost like a passport to provide your services across all 27 EU member states,” said Emilien Bernard-Alzias, partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons LLP.  EU’s single market  Like other crypto exchanges, Binance also bet big on Europe, applying for licenses and registrations in several countries in an effort to serve as many markets as possible.  But recent developments – from being ordered to halt operations in Belgium, quitting the Netherlands after failing to get a license, giving up its registration with a Cyprus regulator, and withdrawing applications for regulatory approval in Austria and Germany – have seemingly narrowed Binance’s options in Europe.  The company has said its withdrawal from Cyprus was in preparation for MiCA coming into effect, and its efforts to focus on fewer European jurisdictions. Although it preemptively withdrew an application for approval in Germany following reports that a custody license was denied by the country’s financial regulator, BaFin, the company has said it still intends to apply for licensing in Germany.  At press time, Binance was registered with regulators in France, Italy, Lithuania, Spain, Poland and Sweden, according to its website. Of those countries, where Binance chooses to focus its resources on to become MiCA compliant may matter – and the exchange says it will be flexible to become a regulated entity.  “MiCA is a pragmatic solution to the shared issues that the industry and regulators face together. It provides a clear route to compliant access to the single market for businesses while also providing strong guardrails that protect users while supporting innovation,” a spokesperson for Binance said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk. “With existing registrations in six EU countries, Binance stands ready to make any necessary changes to our business during the implementation period to fully comply with MiCA’s requirements.”  Choosing a jurisdiction  It matters which EU countries crypto exchanges seek approval in at this stage, because not all nations are equally ready to implement MiCA, Bernard-Alzias said.  For instance, countries like Italy and Spain opened registries for crypto firms operating locally to comply with the minimum requirements set by the EU’s anti-money laundering directive AMLD5. Entry into these registries require little more than a local address and a few bits of information.  Meanwhile, other jurisdictions like France and Germany have established more robust crypto licensing regimes that involve thorough examinations of the makeup and management of a business before approving registration or licenses.  According to Anika Patz, associated partner at law firm YPOG, crypto firms in general don’t get licenses easily in Germany thanks to a “diligent” regulator looking to avoid another scandal like FTX or Wirecard, where the payment processor committed accounting fraud to hide losses for at least five years until its insolvency in 2020.  Crypto custodians that wanted to operate in Germany had the chance to enter in a grandfathering period where the firms needed to apply for a license under the German Banking Act but were allowed to continue operating under a preliminary license. To obtain a license, providers have to build up their organization with “people on the ground,” including robust compliance and risk management teams as well as sufficient IT knowledge and infrastructure to prove to BaFin that the business is legitimate, according to Patz.  “If you propose a business where basically none of your infrastructure’s based in Europe … If you outsource all of your functions to third countries, and you have two people on the ground here [in Germany], [BaFin] cannot really say you are in charge of your business. And it will not provide your license,” Patz said.  Patz and Bernard-Alzias agree Germany has a complex licensing process for crypto firms compared to other EU member states – which is modeled after the EU’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) – and crypto firms that are already licensed under the German regime will be able to transition smoothly into the MiCA regime. But Bernard-Alzias contends that the stringent regime might also be the reason there aren’t too many crypto firms based in Germany.  “If you are a MiFID firm, honestly, it’s quite easy for you to become a crypto asset service provider” under MiCA because Germany’s MiFID regime is “even more complicated” and for more complex firms, Bernard-Alzias said. “But the fact is there are not many crypto service providers in Germany because of that,” he added.  Betting big on France  Meanwhile, France has been busy courting crypto firms with its own MiCA-ready licensing regime. Not only is the country considering a fast-track to licensing for companies already on its vetted registry with the financial watchdog AMF, it recently handed out its first ever crypto license to Societe Generale’s SG Forge. AMF on Thursday introduced “enhanced” registration requirements for crypto firms to align with MiCA.  Binance is registered with the AMF but has yet to obtain a license. Zhao, who praised the MiCA regime in 2022, also said Paris was likely to “explode” in the next five years as the crypto hub of Europe.  But it was recently revealed that the exchange has been under investigation by public prosecutors in the country since at least February 2022 and that its offices were raided earlier this year, seemingly dimming Binance’s chances of getting licensed.  Generally speaking though, investigations by prosecutors don't necessarily hurt a company’s operations in the country, according to Bernard-Alzias. For instance, offices of banking giants including Societe Generale and HSBC were searched by prosecutors in March as part of a massive tax fraud case.  Although there’s no saying if or when Binance might finally win a French crypto license, given BaFin’s track record for approving crypto firms, France might be its likely path to MiCA compliance – and that may be the case for many companies looking to enter the single market.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/10/why-binance-is-abandoning-most-of-europe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34d7e8ae6e2bf4abe988de2b5eba8240ccaa7e14-3328x1872.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, Solana’s growth during the past month was driven in significant part by an increase in the TVL of protocols for staking and yielding based on Solana. Related Reading: BlackRock Insiders Give A Timeline For When The First Spot Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved TVL refers to the total amount of assets deposited in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol and is used as a metric to rank platforms. On-chain reports show that Solana grew its TVL by $45 million in July, corresponding to a 14.4% growth. According to DeFi Llama, Solana currently sits at the 9th position in terms of TVL locked in all chains. Solana is now at a TVL of $320.07 million, representing a massive growth from its $205.11 million TVL at the beginning of the year. While Ethereum still has the highest value with a TVL of $23.3 billion, it saw its TVL decline by 13% over the past month. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) also posted a monthly loss in TVL, dropping by 4.6% to $3.3 billion. SOL price recovers to $24.75 as TVL grows | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com How Far Can SOL Go In 2023? While the increase in TVL is due in part to an increase in the TVL of protocols, Solana also witnessed a surge in price at the beginning of July. Data from Coinmarketcap shows the price of Solana shot up from $18.9 on July 1 to $27.4 on July 16 to reach a market cap of $11.81 billion. Solana, along with Bitcoin, led the surge in the crypto market around this time period. As a consequence, the surge in Solana’s price led to a direct proportion in the value of the total assets locked in DeFi protocols on the chain. Related Reading: Beware Of Crypto Firms Falsely Claiming To Have Submitted License Applications Despite having a TVL growth in the last month, user activity on the chain dropped toward the end of the month. Its market cap also dropped to $9.7 billion at the end of July, demonstrating the volatility of the crypto market. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $24.85 and is up by 14.93% in a monthly timeframe. Although experts predict Solana can surge above $30 before the end of the year.

Why The Aptos-Microsoft Deal Is A Reason To Short APT,"Aptos (APT) has scored a major deal with tech giant Microsoft yesterday. However, the announcement of a “partnership” between Aptos Labs and tech giant Microsoft has raised eyebrows and ignited debates across the crypto community if this is just smoke and mirrors. With the APT token witnessing a surge of nearly 20% following the news, and a significant token unlock looming, the timing and nature of this partnership have come under scrutiny. Aptos-Microsoft Deal Just A Click? In the official press release, Aptos Labs revealed its plans to integrate Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The collaboration aims to introduce a range of tools and services, including the Aptos Assistant chatbot, powered by Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service. The chatbot is designed to assist users with queries about the Aptos ecosystem and offer resources to developers crafting smart contracts and decentralized applications. Related Reading: Aptos Labs’ Collaboration With Microsoft Sends APT Soaring By 17% CEO Mo Shaikh commented on the convergence of AI and blockchain, stating, “Artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies are quickly converging for one important reason: They are both generational breakthroughs that profoundly impact the evolution of the internet and shape society.” However, the partnership’s announcement has not been without its critics. Renowned crypto analyst @DefiSquared, known for being the top-ranked trader on Bybit, took to Twitter to express his skepticism. He pointed out, “lmao what. Did you guys really just pump Aptos 15% on the “news” that it’s paying to use Microsoft Azure services? Seems like an obvious short on a chain that yes, still has no users and an $8 bil valuation with an infinite token supply and 100% annual emissions.” @DefiSquared further highlighted the timing of the news, just two days (on Friday) before more than 4.5 million APT tokens (2% of the circulating supply) will be unlocked, suggesting potential ulterior motives. He also shared a screenshot from Microsoft’s website, indicating the ease with which entities can join the Microsoft AI Cloud partner program, sarcastically remarking, “Aptos really clicked ‘Enroll at no cost and become a partner today’ and added a billion dollars to their market cap. Who knew it was that easy?” Aptos really clicked “Enroll at no cost and become a partner today” and added a billion dollars to their market cap.

Aptos’ representative emphasized the collaborative nature of the partnership, stating, “This is a collaboration from day one. Aptos Labs’ team of AI experts, Ph.Ds, and Web3 developers are working directly with Microsoft’s AI team to train models, integrate AI technology into the Aptos Assistant and GitHub elements integrating with Aptos’ blockchain.” APT Price Analysis As the crypto community continues to dissect the nuances of this partnership, the question remains: Is this a genuine stride forward for Aptos, or a well-timed PR move to buoy token prices ahead of a significant unlock for venture capitalists (VCs)? Only time will tell. At press time, the APT price stood at $7.27. Thus, APT failed to post a higher high. The price has already bounced downwards off the resistance at $7.98 and also ahead of the 200-day EMA as well as the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level.

Via a recent press release, Wanchain has successfully launched its WanBridge on Cardano, which looks set to boost interoperability between the Cardano ecosystem and the rest of the crypto market. The first #USDC has been bridged from #Arbitrum to #Cardano mainnet! @circle @jerallairePublic launch #comingsoon to the industry's most secure decentralised cross-chain bridge: https://t.co/SFaBxQwof3. #WeAreAllConnected $USDC pic.twitter.com/LRAGR7MrXS — Wanchain (@wanchain_org) August 4, 2023 Cardano Interoperability is Finally Here As a world first, Wanchain’s Cardano Bridges now connect the Cardano mainnet to any EVM network and a number of non-EVM networks. Seamless moving of ADA, Cardano tokens, and ERC20 tokens can be moved on the network, opening up endless possibilities, whether it be for businesses, regular crypto users, or developers. One of the most exciting propositions of the new Wanchain Bridges is that for the first time, fiat-backed stablecoins can now be used on Cardano, and the possibilities look set to spark some inspiration in a blockchain subset that has been previously off-limits to the wider crypto sphere. Making WanBridge Solid As an infrastructure builder since 2017, Wanchain sees its Bridges as a milestone moment via its recent press release. Written from scratch using Haskell smart contracts needed to support cross-chain activity, WanBridge is able to interact with Cardano-based smart contracts from outside of the network via the construction of UTXO transactions. Additionally, there is now functionality for Schnorr signature and Secp256k1 curve, which enhances the authenticity and integrity of the bridge function tenfold. With Bitcoin, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Astar, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Optimism, Polygon, Tron, and other prominent public networks now available to communicate with Cardano smart contracts, it’s going to be a wild ride seeing what comes next from the community and market at large with this powerful new tool. Increased liquidity for the Cardano ecosystem and access to Cardano’s powerful suite of tools within other ecosystems is going to be a game changer and we’ll be keeping our ears to the ground for further developments. The bridges are already open for use, and further information can be viewed via the WanBridge site. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Countries in the EU are preparing to implement the recently finalized Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation for digital assets and firms looking to serve the single market, set to take effect in the next 12 - 18 months. France, which already has a comprehensive licensing regime for crypto firms pending some changes to comply with MiCA, has been courting companies to register in the country.  The ""enhanced"" registration requirements are set to take effect from Jan. 1, 2024, and will be mandatory for ""new players"" looking to provide any regulated services, the AMF said. The changes will also ""allow a fast track procedure to be implemented towards"" authorization for firms that have already been operating in the country with approval.  ""As a reminder, DASPs that obtained a simple registration before Jan. 1, 2024 benefit from a ""grandfather"" clause and continue to be subject to the framework applicable before this date,"" the regulator said.  Modified provisions of the AMF General Regulation for digital asset service providers cover ""security and internal control systems, systems for managing conflicts of interest, clear, accurate and non-misleading information, public pricing policies, specific custody provisions (segregation of client assets vs. own assets),"" and bans firms from using client assets without their express prior consent.  The AMF recently awarded its first crypto license to Societe Generale's crypto division. Firms like Binance and Hex Trust are registered with the regulator.

Gnosis Pay is a decentralized payment network that allows someone to pay at any merchant who accepts Visa with the cryptocurrency in their on-chain account. We believe contemporary Web3 games must adopt a more focused approach, deploying smart contracts solely for elements that add tangible value to the gamer’s experience. Crypto evolution, from Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to crypto-linked debit cards, struggles with adoption due to technological complexities and infrastructures - Gnosis Pay ( GNO-USD ) aims to solve key issues. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. “The defense against the substitution of sovereign currencies is the maintenance of robust, trusted, and credible domestic institutions.” - IMF Blog, July 2023 After 6 months of dramatic BTC & ETH ( ETH-USD ) outperformance, many so-called “altcoins” rallied in July, especially those that had been designated securities in recent SEC lawsuits like SOL ( SOL-USD ) (+24%), MATIC ( MATIC-USD ) (+5%), and ADA ( ADA-USD ) (+9%), following Ripple’s victory vs. the SEC on the matter of whether XRP ( XRP-USD ) the token (+51%) is a security when traded on centralized crypto exchanges. For the month, Bitcoin & Ethereum fell (both down 3%), while nearly every other crypto sector we track posted gains, except for the long-suffering Metaverse coins. In our view, one major challenge for digital asset investors is balancing the winner-take-all characteristics historically evident among digital platforms with the extreme price performance disparity already evident year-to-date. Historically, Bitcoin dominance rises in the early part of a bull market and then fades as investors borrow against those gains to speculate on riskier assets. This time, however, leverage is less available, and the regulatory environment in the US is much more severe. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin halving is still ahead of us.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Layer 1s Layer 1 smart contract platforms (SCPs) rose 4% in July, while the sector (MVSCLE) 30-day annualized volatility fell to 34%, the lowest of the 4 major categories we track. Falling volatility has been a trend for much of the past year despite extreme events, including the collapse of FTX, Luna ( LUNA-USD ), and 3AC. At the same time, the market cap of stablecoins has moved in lockstep with the falling volatility. This makes sense to us because as opportunities for trading decline due to decreased vol, stablecoin yields should also fall, reducing demand for stablecoins. We think a new leverage cycle is a precondition for the type of absolute returns and volatility that have characterized past cycles. But so far, there is little evidence of rising demand or supply for leverage. Anyway, among the SCPs we track, the best performers of the month were Solana ((SOL-USD)), up 24%, and Optimism ( OP-USD ), +23%. This month's laggards included Stacks ( STX-USD ), down 14%, Fantom ( FTM-USD ), down 23%, and Ethereum -4%.

In July, Solana yet again proved its resilience by rebounding from major ecosystem FUD. In early June, the SEC labeled Solana a security in its lawsuit vs. Coinbase ( COIN ), and this catalyzed a 25% decline in the price of SOL. Since then, Solana has seen its fundamental metrics improve as ecosystem participants grew amid the rebirth of Solana DeFi. Though daily active users on Solana only saw a slight increase, around 3.5%, Solana applications like MarginFi, Hxro, and Drift catalyzed on-chain activity and caused a 31% bump in DEX volume and a 12.5% increase in TVL. As a result of the increase in usership on Solana, fees increased by 30% compared to the month of June. One interesting announcement in the Solana ecosystem was the concurrent announcements from both Neon, a Solana infrastructure project, and the Solana Foundation. Both entities launched compilers that would enable Solana to run Solidity smart contracts. As a result, Solana now has two credible offerings that will make it simpler for Ethereum developers to move over to Solana without making major changes to their coding language. Such offerings may bolster Solana’s ability to vie for the pie of blockchain developers. Another positive development for the Solana ecosystem was the listing of Helium ( HNT-USD ) tokens on Coinbase after a successful move to the Solana blockchain. Helium is a decentralized cellphone and wireless communication network which originally ran a purpose-built layer 1 blockchain but migrated to Solana to save development costs and boost performance. Also helping Solana this month was the verdict in the Ripple case, which stipulated that tokens like SOL could be considered both securities and commodities - thus removing the probability that the SOL token would be proven through litigation to be a security under all circumstances. Share of Fees: Optimism vs Arbitrum vs. Polygon Source: Artemis as of 7/31/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Despite increasing competition in the Layer-2 sub-sector of smart contract platform market, with Starknet announcing a major software improvement to enable more throughput, Mantle launching their mainnet Layer-2, and Polygon asserting a compelling multi-chain vision alongside a token revamp, Optimism’s OP token was a top performer in July. Regarding fundamental metrics, daily active addresses were up 23%, fees were up 29%, and daily transactions on Optimism surpassed Abitrum ’s for the last few days of the month. Important catalysts came from increased interest in decentralized perpetual futures platforms like Kwenta and the launch of Sam Altman’s (OpenAI founder) WorldCoin , which runs on Optimism. For background, WorldCoin is a decentralized identity protocol with 2.1M accounts created. With each user onboarded, WorldCoin must create a wallet to hold that user’s identification credentials. Over the last week, WorldCoin employed Gnosis’ Safe product (see more on Gnosis below) to create a new wallet for each newly onboarded user. A significant percentage of these will likely begin using crypto assets on Optimism. The result is that WorldCoin may become a robust onboarding mechanism for cryptocurrency in general and the Optimism network in particular. Optimism in July asserted its vision for its Optimism Superchain internet of blockchains governance structure and community norms while hinting at potential value accrual pathways. In a post that Optimism titled “Law of Chains” , the Optimism Collective (a band of companies, communities, and citizens working on the protocol) hinted that social norms should drive all blockchains and that those built using Optimism code should opt into Optimism’s future sequencer set which will be staked with OP tokens. While this declaration is non-binding, it sets the table for increasing community and builder cohesion around driving value back to the OP token to pay the OP team developing Optimism’s open-source software. Stacks Stacks ((STX-USD)) fell 14% in July, underperforming most L1s and L2s. The most telling metric of Stacks’ decline is the significant drop in the token’s daily trading volumes. During the month of June, the STX token averaged $55 million in daily trading volumes, with a monthly high of $120 million traded on June 22nd, coinciding with a local maximum for the token price at $0.82. Conversely, this past month, the average daily trading volume plunged to around $23 million. On the surface level, it appears the underperformance this month is a simple mean reversion back to similar price levels before the few isolated days in June, with the token sitting just under $0.60. In the months of June and May, Stacks had emerged as among the most credible of the Bitcoin L2s, on which Ordinals might be traded. As the narrative dried up, trading volumes and general interest in Stacks also evaporated. Diving deeper into Stacks’ on-chain data, we notice the number of daily active addresses has continuously declined since the start of the year. In fact, daily active addresses hovered around 1,000 since the beginning of July, which marks the longest consecutive period this year in that range. Whether we are measuring market cap-to-TVL or price-to-active addresses. STX appears to be discounting a high probability of exponential growth in users and deposits. Stacks’ market cap to active address ratio is among the highest since late spring, ahead of the protocol’s “Nakamoto” consensus upgrade scheduled for November, which may increase the usability of the chain.

Fantom ((FTM-USD)) suffered immensely this month with the hacking of the Multichain bridge , Fantom’s most important bridge to Ethereum, taking centerstage. TVL of Fantom dropped from $200 million to $67 million following the exploit, during which $126 million was drained from its Ethereum liquidity pools, rendering the wrapped representation of these assets on Fantom worthless. This is because Multichain holds assets on one end of the bridge and mints a backed representation of each asset on the other end. When Multichain was attacked, the hacker took the locked assets on the Ethereum side, which caused the minted representations on Fantom to become worthless. Since Fantom has no native stablecoins, all the value in popular stablecoins on its chain, including USDC ( USDC-USD ), USDT ( USDT-USD ), and TUSD ( TUSD-USD ), were bridged representations, with Multichain dominating 80% of this market. While the actual Fantom token itself was not exposed to the Multichain hack, the hack represents a loss of trust in the chain. As a result of the hack, Fantom saw its most popular lending protocol, Geist, halted and then abandoned as the value of its tokens became zero. While transactions, users, and fees increased for the month, this can be attributed to uncertainty-induced volatility and the rush to exit the Fantom ecosystem.

Stablecoins as Payments Infrastructure: Gnosis Pay Deep Dive The founding vision of cryptocurrency was to create a medium of exchange whose value was unalterable by central authorities who could depreciate the currency, censor what it could be used for, and restrict who could use it. While the first successful cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, fulfills much of the original vision, it fails to be practical for most people. This is because the Bitcoin network lacks the responsiveness, scalability, and simplicity necessary for mass consumer audiences. Also, its volatile value and lack of deep liquidity made it costly to hold and difficult to exchange. To solve these problems, the next solution was stablecoins which are tokens whose value was pegged to a fiat currency by an algorithm or by being backed by off-chain assets. Stablecoins solve the issue of the risks of holding BTC and the challenges of hedging price exposure. Furthermore, more advanced blockchain designs solved time constraints that enabled payments to be settled in seconds rather than minutes. However, adopting cryptocurrencies for payments has remained elusive because most people simply do not want to deal with the blockchain. Users and merchants did not want to go through the added hassle of learning how to use wallets or the time commitment of exchanging crypto and fiat. Instead, merchants and consumers remained wedded to existing digital payments infrastructure using things like point-of-sale card station devices and credit cards. The next attempt to solve the payments problem was to tie cryptocurrencies to debit cards. Thus, emerged centralized exchanges like Binance ( BNB-USD ), Coinbase, and Crypto.com, each offering debit cards that were linked to user exchange accounts. While users could deposit stablecoins, other digital assets, and fiat into their exchange accounts to be used by these debit cards, users were still shackled to centralized service providers who held custody over the users’ digital assets. At the same time, there was no direct link to a user’s on-chain account. Now, Gnosis Pay has established an innovative product to solve some of these issues. Gnosis Pay is a decentralized payment network that allows someone to pay at any merchant who accepts Visa with the cryptocurrency in their on-chain account. Gnosis Pay can accomplish this feat through its partnership with Mone rium and their “EURe: which is a 1:1 Euro-backed stablecoin. On the backend, Monerium creates IBANs (international bank account numbers) for each card which links to each Gnosis Pay user’s on-chain account. Because Monerium is connected to the Euro area’s SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) payment system, it can accept EURe tokens from Gnosis Pay users’ blockchain accounts, convert them into fiat and transmit them across SEPA to merchants at the point of sale. As a result, any user with EURe stablecoins in their on-chain wallet can use the Gnosis Pay debit card to pay at any merchant that accepts Visa. On the flip side, because each Gnosis Pay account has an associated IBAN, payments remitted in Euros are converted by Monerium into EURe stablecoins and sent to each account holder's blockchain wallet. All a user has to do is to have a balance of EURe stablecoins in their blockchain account linked to their Gnosis Pay debit card. EURe Supply ($USD) Source: Defillama.com as of 7/28.2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. To use Gnosis Pay, each user will have to have an account on Gnosis Pay’s Layer-2 blockchain of the Gnosis network. In practice, Gnosis Pay users must port token value from other blockchains, such as Ethereum, BSC ( BSC-USD ), Gnosis, and Polygon, using the Gnosis Omnibridge to Gnosis Pay before the Gnosis debit card can use it. Or, they can send fiat payments to their Gnosis Pay IBAN, which will be converted into EURe stablecoins and deposited into their accounts. When a user sends funds to the Gnosis Pay Layer-2, they are screened for AML behavior and given KYC/KYB check by an identity verification company called Fractal . Once authorized and an account is created, a user authorizes the card to automatically draw from her or her blockchain account by linking it with the Gnosis Pay Application. The gas required for the transactions on the blockchain is taken care of by Gnosis Pay. In the future , MakerDAO’s Spark Protocol could enable users to borrow EURe stablecoins against their wallet’s non-stablecoin assets to make off-chain payments. Over time, Gnosis Pay will be available to other geographic regions like North America and Asia. Additionally, other stablecoins will be integrated into Gnosis Pay beginning in 4Q2023. Currently, the sign-up cost is €30, and another €10 for minting the card. There is a physical card, and eventually, a mobile card will be offered. Capabilities of Gnosis Pay's Architecture Source: Gnosis ETHCC Presentation. We believe Gnosis Pay has made a substantial step forward that unlocks payments for everyday crypto users and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs, which are blockchain-based entities that often govern the business operations of on-chain applications, can now seamlessly pay for off-chain services in fiat, including vendor fees, employee wages, advertising, etc. Gnosis Pay has a high potential for adoption because many DAOs use Gnosis’s Safe multi-signature wallet to secure their on-chain treasuries. Collectively, Gnosis SAFE products secure more than $58B in value on blockchains for DAOs, and converting a significant fraction of those entities to Gnosis Pay appears probable. At this stage, the biggest impediments to mass adoption are Gnosis’s Pay’s limited geographic scope, the necessity of using the Gnosis Pay L2, the low float of EURe, and the lack of support for USD-based stablecoins like USDT and USDC. From the standpoint of usability, the ability to tap into the US financial system will be the biggest ongoing hurdle for Gnosis Pay growing widespread usage. From a regulatory perspective, it will be difficult for them to get partners, but it is almost certainly a top priority for the project’s team. Another impediment to the greater success of Gnosis Pay is that it requires funds to be on the Gnosis Pay L2. The experience of bridging to Gnosis Pay is risky and time-consuming, and it exposes users to the risks of Gnosis Pay’s L2. Furthermore, because the supply of EURe is small at only $12M, there is not enough liquidity to feed a rapidly growing user base. This relatively small asset base makes it challenging for users to swap other assets for EURe without significantly moving the EURe price away from its peg. Gnosis Pay is not alone in its non-custodial crypto debit cards, as the competitive marketplace is growing quickly. Some top constituents include Holyheld , BasedApp , Stables , and Suberra . While each of these competitors has shown potential, each is currently limited to its geographical areas due to banking system challenges and regulatory constraints. Holyheld is limited to EU residents, BasedApp is relegated to Singaporeans, and Stables is accessible only to Australians. On the other hand, Suberra, which has yet to launch its card, will be available to users in the US. The biggest drawback of the competing offerings is user experience. In the case of BasedApp, Stables, and Holyhold, users must manually convert stablecoins to fiat currencies to “top-up” their fiat bank accounts to have funds to spend on the card. Gnosis Pay, by contrast, automatically pulls EURe balances when using a debit card. Additionally, the debit card holder must manually convert the fiat from their bank account into crypto to have the value back on the blockchain. Currently, the fee structure for Gnosis Pay is unknown, as is Suberra’s, but the other competitive products have public fee structures that vary widely. BasedApp charges no fees on transfers but a card creates fee and foreign transaction fees. It seems their monetization model relies upon the interest generated by holding the SGD that backs SGD stablecoins. Holyheld, on the other hand, has a deep menu of different types of charges for its product. It tells users to create new cards and charges them for crypto to fiat conversions at 0.75% for topping up the card or exchanging fiat for crypto. Additionally, Holyheld charges for a litany of other account actions, including outgoing fiat payments, fair usage charges, and account pin number change fees. By contrast, Stables does not charge for transfers or card usage but instead charges users a 1.5% fee when they swap between fiat and crypto to “top up” or withdraw from their fiat account. Going forward, Gnosis has many different pathways it can choose to take that could lead to mass adoption. The chief obstacle it faces today is the strong user experience of the credit card ecosystem. While users love the simplicity of paying for things using credit cards and the rewards generated, merchants dislike the process of obfuscating credit card fees in higher consumer prices and/or paying for credit card charges themselves. Point of Sale devices like Stripe ( STRIP ) create even more costly overhead for consumer businesses. For example, Strip takes 2.7% on each transaction and a $0.05 fee. Gnosis Pay’s success could be found by unrooting this merchant-imposed, odious high fee structure that credit cards impose on the exchange of goods and services. Gnosis could cut into this financial services racket by pushing merchants to charge lower fees for users of its cards through discounts to consumers (whether by lower prices for debit card purchases or higher prices for credit card purchases). This is not only because Gnosis would circumvent the credit card fees but also because Gnosis could send merchants rewards for charge activities using Gnosis Pay. This program could be paid for by Gnosis making an agreement with Monerium to remit some of the interest received from the Euros that back the EURe stablecoins to the merchants. While this would decrease Monerium's margin on the EURe business, it could be a catalyst that massively expands the market potential for EURe due to ardent merchant zest for Gnosis’s economical solution. However, this pathway would be the first step towards getting both the merchant and consumer off existing expensive, card-based point-of-sale infrastructure. In the long term, Gnosis will likely push both the consumer and the merchant to accept blockchain payments using wallet-based services, most likely embedded in cell phones. Regardless of the outcome, this initial entry point by Gnosis Pay is genuinely exciting and, if it lives up to its promise, could ultimately spur legislation in the United States on stablecoins. Additionally, the Gnosis architecture could help a “super-app,” such as X.com (formerly Twitter), launch a self-custody-based digital asset payment platform. In July, Twitter received its first three state money service business ((MSB)) licenses. DeFi The MarketVector Decentralized Finance Leaders Index (MVDFLE) ended July +3%, outperforming Ether’s 3% price decline. The performance was mainly supported by Uniswap ( UNI-USD ), which rallied 20% this month and represented ~33% of the index. dYdX ( DYDX-USD ) and AAVE ( AAVE-USD ) both notched gains this month, rising 6% and 1%, respectively, while LDO ( LDO-USD ) and CRV ( CRV-USD ) held the index back, falling 11% and 21%, respectively. MakerDAO stood out this month as its token, MKR, rallied an impressive 48% after the founder purchased more MKR, and the DAO’s estimated annual profit rose from real-world asset acquisition. Defi TVL dropped from $45.2b to $40.9b in July, driven by the falling price of Ether and the Curve exploit, resulting in many users withdrawing their assets from the protocol. Additionally, overall lending protocol TVL has now surpassed that of decentralized exchanges. This can be attributed to the growing adoption of Ether LSD products and the ease with which users can create negative-interest loans. Such creation is facilitated by the yield-bearing properties of LSD tokens, making them an attractive option for users seeking efficient debt management solutions. Over the last three months, MakerDAO has undertaken a significant transition in its asset composition. The platform has gradually reduced its reliance on USDC as the main asset backing DAI, decreasing it from 50% to approximately 9%. Instead, MakerDAO has adopted yield-bearing real-world assets ((RWA)), which now constitute over 50% of its assets, amounting to approximately $2.4 billion, according to data from a Dune dashboard by @SebVentures. This strategic shift has resulted in a remarkable surge in MakerDAO's estimated annual profit. Since the beginning of May, the estimated profit has nearly quadrupled, rising from $23 million to an impressive $86 million, as reported on Makerburn.com. MakerDAO Monthly Profits Source: VanEck Research, Makerburn.com as of 7/31/23. Furthermore, MakerDAO successfully passed the Enhanced DAI Savings Rate proposal. This new development allows DAI holders to earn up to 8% interest by depositing their DAI into the DAI Savings Rate ((DSR)). The elevated rate will remain in effect until 20% of DAI is deposited into the DSR, providing a very attractive earning opportunity for DeFi users. Currently, just over $300 million of DAI has been deposited into the DSR, about 6.5% of the circulating supply. MakerDao also introduced the Smart Burn Engine, designed to utilize DAI from the Surplus Buffer. This initiative aims to purchase MKR tokens and pair them with DAI, depositing them into the Uniswap V2 DAI-MKR liquidity pool, providing alternative methods for managing MKR tokens. Despite MakerDAO's remarkable growth, DAI's market capitalization still experienced a decline, falling by approximately $90 million in July to $4.56 billion, as stablecoin liquidity dried up, given the lack of volatility and leverage available to borrowers. On top of the positive fundamental developments at MakerDAO, Rune Christensen, the co-founder of MakerDAO, sold about 13 million LDO tokens and subsequently purchased 32,637 MKR tokens at an average price of $734. This move has already proven advantageous, with Rune's trade up over 50% based on the current price of MKR. Conversely, observations by anonymous Twitter user @0xSisyphus pointed out that A16Z and Paradigm, two prominent venture capital firms, are potentially selling MKR tokens. This speculation arose as both firms withdrew MKR from the governance contract and transferred it to Coinbase. It's worth noting that A16Z acquired 6% of the Maker supply in 2018 at a fully diluted value ((FDV)) of $250 million, and Paradigm acquired 5.5% of the Maker supply in 2019 at a $500 million FDV, meaning both investments have underperformed Ethereum significantly over the same period. Curve & Conic Exploit The crvUSD market cap briefly rose over $100m in July but retreated below $90m following a ~$5 million exploit of Conic Finance. Then, on the 30th of the month, some liquidity pools using ETH were exploited due to a compiler reentrancy vulnerability in the version of Vyper used to code the smart contracts. The pools impacted included alETH/ETH, msETH/ETH, pETH/ETH, and CRV/ETH. Teams attempted to whitehack as many pools as they could before they were exploited, and at the time of writing, it would appear that ~$50 million was lost. For context, these pools combined held a fraction of Curve’s TVL, but many users and protocols removed liquidity out of fear, and Curve’s TVL fell ~50%. Hopefully, this liquidity will return as things normalize. LSDFi (Liquid Staked DeFi) The LSDFi narrative is witnessing a significant surge as the staking of ETH to the beacon chain continues. Users are actively depositing their liquid-staked ETH into protocols that allow them to capture higher yields or unlock new utility. The growing amount of staked Ether - 22M ETH staked across 700k validators, representing 19% of total supply and growing - is expected to yield benefits for these protocols, as they allow users to earn more ETH or create negative interest rate loans with their LSDs. Notably, Pendle, Lybra, and Origin protocols saw significant TVL growth last month. Moreover, the introduction of Yearn into the LSD scene has generated anticipation for the full launch of their st-yETH vault. We count $600M+ in TVL across these LSDFi protocols, up from $200M in May. We share details on three strong competitors below. Pendle In July, Pendle introduced Pendle Earn, a streamlined version of their yield trading platform. This new offering allows users to earn an upfront fixed yield on their yield-bearing assets. While retaining the option for speculative and directional trading on variable yield, the protocol now enables users to toggle between Trade and Earn mode on their browser to access either the more comprehensive platform or, the newer simplified version. The rebranding of Pendle Earn has proven highly successful, evident in the significant increase in total value locked, which surged by approximately $30 million to reach $154M million this month, marking an impressive 24% growth. Furthermore, Pendle has been granted support from ETH L2 Mantle Network , a strong signal of recognition and endorsement for Pendle as a new DeFi primitive. This grant incentivizes Pendle to expand its presence to the newly launched chain, showcasing the platform's growing reputation and appeal within the DeFi space. Pendle's achievements underscore the importance of simplifying user experiences in DeFi, as it often plays a pivotal role in driving user adoption of new innovative financial products in DeFi. Pendle TVL Growth YTD Source: VanEck Research, DefiLlama as of 7/31/23. Lybra Lybra Finance, who launched their yield-bearing stablecoin, eUSD, continued to grow in July from $276 million TVL to over $380 million. The lion’s share of this growth came from the continued adoption of eUSD, which saw a $56 million increase in market cap from $136 million to $192 million at the time of writing. Additionally, Lybra released their v2 documentation, which will allow for new LSD products to be used as collateral and see LBR and peUSD deployed as LayerZero Omnichain Fungible Tokens ((OFT)) to be used on Arbitrum, among other protocol enhancements. This should only continue to bolster the protocol’s growth as more LSD liquidity is bridged to layer 2 blockchains to avoid the high transaction costs of Ethereum. Origin Origin Protocol saw significant growth in their liquid staked ether product, Origin Ether, which nearly doubled its TVL in July from $44m to $84m. This was mainly a result of the $110k incentive given to vlCVX holders to vote for CRV emissions to be distributed to the ETH+oETH pool on Curve. Additionally, 20% of protocol fees will go to lock CVX so the protocol can continue to incentivize the liquidity of their LSD product. Origin’s success this month highlights how protocols can leverage the existing DeFi ecosystem to incentivize protocol growth. By making it economically worthwhile for vlCVX holders to direct CRV emissions to the ETH-oETH pool, Origin can begin to create a flywheel effect. Users provide liquidity to earn CRV rewards, which grows the oETH TVL and allows Origin to lock more CVX, resulting in more incentives directed toward the ETH-oETH pool. Yearn Yearn has commenced bootstrapping its yETH product this month in preparation for its full-scale launch. Following the closure of deposits last weekend, the product is set to launch with a Total Value Locked ((TVL)) of $3.9 million, having attracted ~$9,500 in monthly incentives from various LSD protocols and centralized exchanges offering LSD products. These entities are vying for significant allocations of the yETH LSD basket. Notably, Swell Network's largest incentive of ~$3,600 has been allocated to bolster swETH's initial weight in the vault, bolstering the product's appeal and potential yield generation. Based on the current proportion of incentives to deposits, it is estimated that the yETH product will provide an approximate annual percentage yield ((APY)) of ~3% on top of the yield derived from the underlying LSDs. Furthermore, with the inclusion of swap yields, the yETH vault is poised to be highly competitive compared to traditional LSDs. NFTs In the month of July, the NFT market experienced its fifth consecutive monthly decline in volume. Blur maintained its position as the leading NFT exchange by volume, accounting for over 70% of the total NFT volume. However, it's essential to recognize that despite its dominance in volume, OpenSea still outpaced Blur significantly in terms of users and trades, indicating that Blur's primary user base still consists mainly of NFT power users. Blur's peer-to-peer NFT lending platform, Blend, also remained a driving force in NFT loan markets, enabling nearly 94% of loan volume in July. However, there was a noticeable decline in NFT loans throughout the month, with the weekly average loan volume dropping from approximately $180 million in June to around $102 million. NFT Volume: Blue vs. OpenSea Source: VanEck Research, @Hildobby as of 07/31/23. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Metaverse & Gaming: Performance & Fundamentals The Market Vector Media and Entertainment Leaders Index returned -2% for the month of July, nearly matching ETH’s price decline. APE continued to sell off throughout the month, falling 16%, while its peers, SAND ( SAND-USD ) and MANA ( MANA-USD ), recorded losses of only 2.5% and 4%, respectively. APE’s underperformance is magnified by its staking program, which rewards APE holders an unsustainable 49% APY for staking their tokens. Meanwhile, on the Web3 gaming front, active users across the top Web3 games we track fell by 2%, a symptom of the lackluster IP produced and the failure to address the needs of Web2 gamers. Web3 Gaming: Understanding Gamer Preferences and Industry Trends In the Web3 gaming industry, a significant problem has become clear: an overestimation of additional features that truly resonate with gamers. The status quo indicates a strong preference among gamers for marketplaces that facilitate the buying and selling of in-game items, as exemplified by the thriving gray markets for trading Counter-Strike skins. We believe contemporary Web3 games must adopt a more focused approach, deploying smart contracts solely for elements that add tangible value to the gamer’s experience. Key aspects include representing valuable in-game items as NFTs on the backend and providing a web2-like interface for seamless item trading on the front end. At the forefront of utilizing blockchain to deliver value to gamers, ImmutableX has been lauded for its emphasis on aggregating NFT liquidity, creating an intuitive wallet management experience through the Immutable Passport, and leveraging established online gaming marketplaces such as the Epic Game Store and GameStop NFT marketplace. Mythical Games has also emerged as a prominent competitor by challenging the notion of needing the blockchain for anything other than NFTs representing in-game items. They have adopted a different strategy than many other games, launching their apps on major app stores despite Apple and Google's egregious 30% tax levied on in-app purchases while simultaneously establishing their marketplace, DMarket. This approach allows them to reach a broader audience and naturally incentivizes users to engage with DMarket due to more favorable pricing. Notably, DMarket has executed an impressive $162 million in NFT sales since its inception, as reported by Cryptoslam! Despite this success, the MYTH token has underperformed the broader crypto market. Another noteworthy trend observed in the Web3 gaming space is the significance of valuable Intellectual Property ((IP)) tied to existing user interests. Successful games tend to center around popular sports themes, exemplified by Sorare, NBA TopShot, and NFL All Day. Mythical Games follows this trend with their NFL Rivals game, boasting over 1 million players and earning the prestigious position of being ranked as the #1 Sports game on the Apple App Store, currently maintaining a strong position at #4. As the Web3 gaming industry continues to evolve, staying attuned to gamer preferences and industry trends remains crucial for sustained success. Currently, we think the teams that address the most direct concerns from gamers and create games that appeal to things people already have a passion for (such as sports, fashion, and social experiences) will be the most successful. Given the lack of widespread adoption and the less robust monetization models of current gaming tokens, we have limited our investments in the space.

The surge comes ahead of a supply unlock that could add selling pressure, data suggests.  Just over 2% of the APT supply – worth $33 million at current prices – is set to be unlocked on August 12 at 05:30 am UTC, data shows. This is part of a planned move and will decrease locked tokens to 80% of the total supply.  Unlocks increase the circulating supply of any token in the open market, adding bearish sentiment if holders choose to sell and demand fails to keep up – causing prices to plunge quickly.  As such, Aptos has previously been criticized by the broader crypto community for predatory tokenomics and concerns over the distribution of tokens – where core contributors, investors and the Aptos Foundation received almost half the 1 billion tokens issued.  In contrast, Ethereum allocated just 9.9% of ether (ETH) supply to the founding team and another 9.9% to the Ethereum Foundation during its 2015 issuance.  Wednesday’s price surge came as Aptos Labs, a blockchain started by former Meta Inc. employees, said it was expanding its tools and services using Microsoft's artificial intelligence technology.

Aevo's pre-listing futures market debuted on Wednesday with SEI contracts, allowing traders to speculate on the potential post-listing price of the cryptocurrency. The product is analogous to IOU futures offered by some exchanges.  ""The pre-launch futures improve price discovery as users can go both long or short,"" Aevo's Co-founder and CEO Julian Koh told CoinDesk.  SEI's circulating supply upon listing will be 1.8 billion or 18% of the total supply of 10 billion, per Binance.

As of now, SEI is not available for trading on any cryptocurrency exchange, according to data tracked by Coingecko.  Once the cryptocurrency goes live on Binance, the pre-listing futures will start referencing the index price and charge funding rates to traders to keep prices aligned with the spot market value.  In other word, the pre-listing futures will become perpetual swaps after the exchange listing. Funding rates are periodic payments by bullish long or bearish short position holders. Longs pay shorts when perpetuals trade at a premium to the spot price. Meanwhile, shorts pay longs to keep their bearish bets open when perpetuals trade at a discount.

15854634,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546564,1691645149,"SEC Asks Court To File Interlocutory Appeal Vs. Ripple, XRP Price Stable","In a meticulously detailed letter to Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delineated its grounds for seeking an interlocutory appeal against Ripple Labs Inc. This move, which has sent ripples (pun intended) through the XRP community, focuses on the intricate legalities surrounding Ripple’s sales and distributions of XRP. Ripple Vs. SEC: Interlocutory Appeal Incoming The SEC’s primary contention revolves around Ripple’s “programmatic” sales to XRP buyers over crypto asset trading platforms and Ripple’s “other distributions” in exchange for labor and services. The regulatory body asserts that these transactions should be classified as offers or sales of securities, drawing upon the precedent set by the Howey case. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Says He Is Willing To Bet That Ripple Will Win SEC Appeal The SEC’s letter states, “Specifically, the SEC seeks to certify the Court’s holding that Defendants’ ‘Programmatic’ offers and sales to XRP buyers over crypto asset trading platforms and Ripple’s ‘Other Distributions’ in exchange for labor and services did not involve the offer or sale of securities under SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946).” Delving deeper into the document, the SEC underscores the existence of an intra-district split (Judge Jed Rakoff’s ruling in the SEC vs. Terra case) indicating that there are substantial grounds for differences in legal opinion. The letter points out, “Interlocutory review is warranted here. These two issues involve controlling questions of law on which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion, as reflected by an intra-district split that has already developed.” The SEC further draws attention to the potential implications of the court’s previous order, suggesting that it could influence a multitude of pending litigations. The document reads, “The Programmatic Sales and Other Distributions rulings concern issues that may arise in various pending cases, including many in this Circuit where the alleged investment contracts were offered and sold by issuers – like Ripple – on crypto asset trading platforms or for non-cash consideration.” Related Reading: XRP Price: Breaking This Key Resistance Could Propel Crypto To $21 By 2025 – Analyst Jeremy Hogan, a legal luminary in the XRP community, weighed in, noting, “AND… the SEC continues making questionable decisions, requesting an interlocutory appeal. Note that it is NOT appealing whether XRP itself is a security – just its losses on the programmatic and individual sales issues.” Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), clarified the SEC’s intent, emphasizing that the regulatory body is in the preliminary stages of seeking the court’s permission for the appeal. He stated, “The SEC does not have the right to appeal just yet which is why they are asking permission to file an interlocutory appeal. Ripple will file its response with the Court next week.” XRP Price Despite the intricate legal maneuvers and the potential ramifications, XRP’s market price has remained notably stable, suggesting a mature market response to the ongoing legal developments. At press time, XRP actually saw a slight uptick, trading at $0.6378.

15850426,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546552,1691636438,Litecoin Hash Rate Steady Despite Dismal Price Action: Will This Change?,"One week after the highly anticipated Litecoin halving event on August 2, on-chain data reveals that the network’s hash rate, a key measure of computing power channeled to the network, is steady but erratic. As of August 9, trackers indicate that the Litecoin network’s hash rate is hovering around 760 TH/s, a notable decrease from the all-time peak of 816 TH/s recorded in late July 2023. Litecoin Prices Steady But Lower, Rally Incoming? Litecoin prices, on the other hand, are firm but down in the previous week of trading. CoinMarketCap data on August 9 shows that LTC is changing hands at $83, down 5% over the past week. What’s clear is that prices are moving tightly inside a consolidation range. Despite this dip, LTC is relatively resilient, up 17% from June 2023 lows. However, from a top-down preview, the coin is down 26% from the 2023 highs. In the medium term, LTC remains bullish since bears have failed to unwind gains posted from mid-June to mid-July 2023. Whether bulls will maintain control after halving, however, is also unclear. If past performance guides, there is a glimmer of hope for bulls. The previous Litecoin halving in August 2019 was several months before LTC ripped to $400 in 2021. Even so, before this spike, LTC prices nearly halved from $66 to $35 in December 2019. Related Reading: Cardano-Native MuesliSwap To Refund Users After “Slippage” Misunderstanding Unlike previous halvings, the crypto space has matured, and regulatory clarity has improved, particularly concerning Bitcoin—the foundational protocol from which Litecoin emerged. For instance, while most US regulators consider Bitcoin a commodity, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cautious toward other altcoins. Tracking On-Chain Metrics To Gauge Interest Considering the above challenges and regulatory uncertainty, the interconnection between hash rate and spot prices is actively monitored. Litecoin relies on decentralized miners for security and transaction confirmation. The network’s security is evaluated via the hash rate metric, which risks crashing since miners must allocate more resources after the network halved rewards to 6.25 LTC. A potential price decline could trigger a corresponding reduction in hash rate, forcing the network to adjust the difficulty. Related Reading: MakerDAO Debates New EDSR Optimization Plan As MKR Bears Retain Market Control How this evolves remains to be seen, and the network remains stable at spot rates. Besides the hash rate near all-time highs, the network’s activity seems unaffected.

In the past 24 hours, its value increased by nearly 6%. However, XRP hasn’t yet shown significant gains on the weekly chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Crosses $1,800, But How Long Will Bullish Revival Last? The technical analysis suggests a positive trend for XRP, but there’s a chance that the coin could face more downward movement in the upcoming trading sessions. If buyers push the price higher, XRP might maintain its position above the current price level. Moreover, breaking through two crucial resistance levels could lead to a potential surge of over 9%. For XRP to keep rising, the broader market must provide support, particularly Bitcoin’s movement beyond the $30,000 zone. If buying momentum doesn’t recover, XRP might experience a decline and drop below its local support line. The increasing market capitalization of XRP indicates active buyer participation at the present moment. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, the altcoin was priced at $0.65. This value has presented significant resistance for the altcoin in recent weeks. The upcoming trading sessions hold critical importance as XRP must effectively surpass this level. Failing to achieve this could trigger a subsequent decline in the price. Furthermore, overhead resistance levels are $0.67, followed by $0.69. Should XRP successfully breach the $0.69 mark, the altcoin might trade around the $0.72 range. Conversely, a local support level is positioned at $0.63. Should the price dip below this threshold, it could potentially descend to $0.60, ultimately pausing the overall bullish sentiment. Technical Analysis For demand, XRP’s chart indicates its current state as overbought. The Relative Strength Index has reached 70, indicating buyers currently influence the price direction. This could imply the potential for a price correction in the upcoming trading sessions. While such a correction might not be prolonged, any drop in XRP’s value below $0.63 might reduce buyer activity. The asset’s price remained positioned above the 20-Simple Moving Average line. This observation signifies an increasing demand and emphasizes buyers’ role in steering the market’s price dynamics. Furthermore, the altcoin has generated buy signals in response to the rising demand. These buy signals are represented by the emergence of green histograms in the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator, signaling a bullish sentiment. Additionally, the Directional Movement Index presents a positive outlook, with the +DI (blue) line positioned above the -DI (orange) line, indicating a favorable price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Losses Steam Above $30K But The Bulls Are Not Done Yet Moreover, the Average Directional Index (Red) has crossed the 40 mark, implying an increase in the strength of the price trend.

Instead, y00ts said it planned to migrate to Ethereum in order to ""unite the DeGods and y00ts communities."" DeGods, another project created by Los Angeles-based startup DeLabs, migrated to Ethereum in April.  Y00ts said that the date of the migration would be announced ""shortly."" DeGods also announced the upcoming release of a Season III collection in tandem with the migration news.  The two projects initially announced their departure from Solana in December, with DeGods project leader, Rohun Vora, known as Frank, explaining in a Twitter Spaces that the collection had ""capped out on Solana."" Prior to the announcement, sales of DeGods and y00ts made up nearly 70% of all Solana NFT sale volume, according to NFT marketplace Magic Eden.  Y00ts completed its migration to Polygon earlier this year and planned to use the grant money to fund its team expansion and continue to grow its project. Polygon said it plans to re-deploy $1 million of the refunded grant to empower its native network of builders and creators.  Vora said in a tweet that ""it's all love"" between the parties involved.  ""We tried our best to make it work but we just need to bring our 2 communities together,"" he tweeted.  In a statement, Vora said that Polygon Labs had been a ""truly incredible partner for y00ts.""  ""But ultimately, we believe it makes the most sense for y00ts to be on the same chain as DeGods,"" said Vora. ""We feel really lucky to have collaborated with so many great, hard-working people at Polygon Labs, and we can’t thank them enough. It's an exciting chapter for all of us, and I’m looking forward to what the future holds.”  Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal appeared supportive of the decision, saying that Vora and his team were helpful in expanding Polygon's growing NFT ecosystem.  “Frank and team played a huge role in helping us expand the NFT [profile picture] ecosystem on Polygon,” said Nailwal. “We will continue to nurture this community that’s tripled in size this year by redeploying the y00ts funds and more to support our native creators and projects we believe have the vision and conviction to help evolve NFTs, both as an artform and as a key to boundless utility.”  Response to the announcement was mixed on X, formerly Twitter, though most community members sounded off in support of the move.

The world's largest digital asset is trading at $29,581, down 0.8%, while ether is trading at $1,854, down 0.1%.  Overall, the crypto market seems to have shrugged off news from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it intends to file an appeal of the ruling in its case against Ripple, which ended in a partial victory for Ripple in July.  Last month, U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that Ripple's XRP token sales did not constitute investment contracts, though institutional sales violated federal securities laws. The ruling led to a rally in XRP, Solana's SOL token, and other tokens that were alleged to be securities, but legal experts believe it does not fully settle the definition of a digital asset as a security under U.S. law.  Now, the SEC is seeking to appeal part of a recent decision that ruled Ripple's programmatic sales and other distributions of XRP did not involve the offer of or sale of securities under the Howey test, while a federal judge previously determined that Ripple's direct sales to institutional investors violated securities law.  SOL is flat on the news as is Cardano (ADA) and NEAR is down 1%.  It should also be noted that the market is in a relentless period of HODLing at the moment with exchange balances at close to record lows, and the amount of bitcoin and ether that haven't moved in 7-10 years at a record high, meaning that it'll take a lot to move the market – more than the news that the SEC is filing an appeal of a case that it might not win.

But the events still served as an indictment of the prevailing decentralized finance, or DeFi, narrative since last year’s collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange — that centralized platforms are susceptible to greed and poor risk management while decentralized platforms keep chugging along.

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index (7-Day SMA) Has Been Going Up Recently According to data shared by Julio Moreno, the Head of Research at CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium Index has been sharply trending up recently. The “Coinbase Premium Index” here refers to a metric that keeps track of the percentage difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that listed on Binance (USDT pair). This metric can help us know which platform’s user base is buying or selling more of the asset. For example, when the index’s value is greater than zero, it means that an extra amount of buying pressure has been present on Coinbase, which has pushed the asset’s price up on the platform (or just a lower amount of selling pressure than on Binance is there on Coinbase). Coinbase is known to be used more heavily by US-based investors (especially large institutional traders), while Binance’s traffic is spread around the globe. Thus, if more buying is happening on Coinbase, it can be a sign that the US-based investors are participating in more buying than the global traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Show Accumulation Again, Bullish Sign? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index over the past couple of months: The 7-day value of the metric seems to have been rising in recent days | Source: Julio Moreno on X As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day SMA Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index has only been negative this month, implying that the global investors have either outpaced the US traders in accumulation or the Americans have been selling to a higher degree. Recently, however, as news has started to come out that the probability of the BTC spot ETFs being approved in the US is increasing, the indicator has turned around and is now heading up. The metric has sharply increased in the past day, suggesting that the US-based institutional traders may now be participating in some heavy buying. Related Reading: Litecoin Long-Term Holders Smartly Exited Before Halving, Data Shows During this same period, Bitcoin has observed a recovery rally in which the cryptocurrency’s price briefly managed to touch the $30,000 mark before falling back to the current levels. Naturally, the timing of the rally and the 7-day Coinbase Premium Index sharply going up could imply that the buying from the American holders are providing the fuel for the move. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) Premium, a metric that checks for whether GBTC is trading at a premium or a discount, has also been trending up recently, implying that the discount on the fund is decreasing (although it’s not near the positive territory yet unlike the Coinbase Premium Index). Looks like the metric's value is becoming less negative | Source: CryptoQuant GBTC is a fund that allows users to get indirect exposure to Bitcoin in a way that traditional investors would be more familiar with. Thus, this metric holds hints about the buying or selling activity in which the more conventional US institutional traders are currently participating. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,800, up 1% in the last week.

Both demand and accumulation have expanded on the daily chart, reflecting positive sentiment. Despite bullishness, the speed of SOL’s recovery depends on its ability to swiftly overcome the immediate barrier, which had previously acted as a tough resistance level. Additionally, the bulls must ensure that the price remains above the local support, as a drop below would invalidate the bullish thesis. Furthermore, Solana’s market capitalization has improved, indicating a gradual inflow of buyers into the market now. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart Trading at $24.84, SOL has successfully breached the $23 resistance level, marking a growth of nearly 6%. This upward movement has reignited buyer interest, yet for Solana’s recovery to persist, it must exceed the $25 threshold. Breaking past this point would enable the bulls to advance by an additional 8%, with a potential target of $27. Conversely, the primary support levels for this altcoin are situated at $24 and subsequently at $22. A drop below $22 would revive bearish momentum, possibly prolonging a bearish phase. Technical Analysis As Solana surpassed the $23 level, there was a surge in demand for the coin, leading to an overbought condition. The Relative Strength Index rested just below the 70 mark, indicating a predominance of buyers in the market. Similarly, SOL maintained its position above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating buyers were steering the price momentum. Notably, Solana was also above the 200-SMA (green) line, signifying a state of bullishness. Despite its bullish trajectory, the potential for a price pullback cannot be dismissed, considering that SOL was still near the overbought zone. Aligned with the heightened demand, SOL has generated buy signals on the chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), responsible for gauging price momentum and shifts, has given rise to these green histograms. These histograms correspond to buy signals, suggesting that the price might experience a rise before a corrective phase ensues.
