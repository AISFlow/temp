42401545,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd01Cc,1526749521,"Bitcoin Cash Fork Leaves Users Behind, But Does It Matter?","Bitcoin cash now has 32MB blocks and smart contract functionality.  The controversial hard fork of bitcoin hard forked again several days ago in an effort to add new functionality to the cryptocurrency protocol and further differentiate it from its predecessor. But in the process – executing at block 530350 – a portion of the bitcoin cash community was left behind.  At the time of writing, between 16 percent and 17 percent of bitcoin cash nodes are running old software and because of the way upgrading by hard fork works (whereby changes are not backwards compatible), those nodes are now running on a completely separate network. As such, if any user running one of those nodes were to make a transaction, the new, larger bitcoin cash network would not recognize it.  Critics of bitcoin cash argue it's a bad sign that so many nodes haven't upgraded, since those users are now completely cut off from the rest of the network.  Some have even gone as far as to argue the quietness around the hard fork as a sign that relatively few people care about bitcoin cash. If more people cared, they contend, the changes would see more debate, because people would be worried about the implications, Bitcoin Core contributor Kalle Alm argued on social media.  ""You can tell bitcoin cash is not bitcoin by looking at how not everyone is losing their shit all over the place,"" he said, adding:  ""Imagine if 20 percent of bitcoin nodes failed consensus? Everyone would explode.""  But proponents of the network disagree.  ""That's a rather meaningless statistic. Likely the reason those nodes haven't upgraded is because they aren't in use and the owners haven't bothered yet,"" said Chris Pacia, lead developer at OB1's OpenBazaar.  A popular fork  Pacia pushed back on the idea the calm surrounding the hard fork means anything but that users were happy with the upgrade.  Despite a portion of users not yet upgrading their systems to go along with it, Pacia said, all miners have upgraded. And sure enough, leading up to the fork, social media comments among bitcoin cash advocates were overwhelmingly in favor of the changes.  ""The network update has the full support of the community, with bitcoin cash aiming to compete with the [lightning] network of bitcoin,"" said Matthew Newton, an analyst at crypto investment platform eToro, in a statement.  The statement continued:  ""Increasing the block size and allowing smart contracts to be built is seen as an important step in its quest to become the dominant cryptocurrency.""  The new features look like they're working properly so far.  Pacia was one of the first to use OP_CAT, one of the so-called smart contracts added to the protocol through the hard fork.  And other projects got a boost from the new features too. For instance, because of the bigger block size, users can now write longer messages on the bitcoin cash social media site Memo.cash.  ""If this was a contentious change and those nodes didn't upgrade because they legitimately wanted to stick with the world rules than that could be a problem. But I'm pretty sure that isn't the case here,"" Pacia added.  Reckless competition?  That said, the hard fork continues to draw mixed reception from the broader cryptocurrency community.  The hard fork that led to bitcoin cash was a controversial one and even though the two groups have went their separate ways, there is still arguments over the groups use of language and marketing.  Alm told CoinDesk he thinks it's ""insane"" that bitcoin cash developers don't care about the node statistic more and ""that goes to show how little [they] care about individual sovereignty.""  ""In bitcoin, the nodes are everything. They are the users of the system. To dismiss cutting off a fifth of your users in a hard fork, controversial or not, is reckless, to say the least,"" Alm added.  And further, many critics argue the upgrades in the latest bitcoin cash hard fork don't have good trade-offs for the system as a whole.  For example, increasing the block size too much can decrease the likelihood that anyone can run full nodes in the future, since the storage requirements will be more than most household computers generally allow for. This is a particularly contentious point, since many cryptocurrency enthusiasts believe running a full node is the safest and most decentralized way to use the technology.  Still, bitcoin cash advocates see the effort to continue improving the cryptocurrency as a sign of necessary competition within the space.  ""What events like these are also making clear, however, is the underlying sense of competition between the bitcoin cash and bitcoin communities,"" Newton said. ""Both are fiercely passionate about these assets and confident that one will emerge as the victor.""  He added:  ""Ultimately, it remains to be seen how that will play out over the long-term, as both cryptocurrencies continue to develop.""

42401548,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd01GY,1526742328,"At Ripple's Snoop Dogg Party, A Search for XRP","Would this be one of those crypto events? A star past his prime pumping the flavor of the month?  As part of the first-ever New York Blockchain Week, Snoop Dogg was booked to perform at the XRP Community Night on Tuesday. The event, as the name would suggest, was meant to celebrate XRP, a cryptocurrency most closely tied with the San Francisco startup Ripple. The party could have provided the latest example of a celebrity hyping crypto: Floyd Mayweather, Dennis Rodman and Paris Hilton have each pumped one token or another in recent months.  Stakes were even higher after the 46-year-old rapper praised the trading app provider Robinhood in January for ""putting tha Crip in Crypto!"" after the company announced plans to roll out bitcoin and ether trading.  ""Snoop's a talker,"" said one attendee at the party, raising his eyebrows to suggest the rapper would have something to say about XRP – or who knows, maybe even a special announcement of his own SnoopCoin.  Nothing like that happened, though.  In fact, XRP mania was difficult to find at the party. Where was the #XRPArmy that pervades certain corners of Twitter, cheering any good news about their favorite cryptocurrency and decrying all bad news as ""garbage,"" ""FUD"" and ""fake news?""    It seems they were few and far between at XRP Community Night. Instead, this was a Ripple party, with a Snoop Dogg show thrown in for good measure.  And the online XRP community seems to have noticed.  ""Has anyone seen any pics yet of last night's party of the actual XRP community and not Ripple employees?"" one user posted to XRP Chat, a forum for the cryptocurrency's enthusiasts. ""From what I have seen so far it seems to have been more like a staff Christmas party than a party hosted for the XRP community.""  That slightly miffed take on the event gets at the heart of the Ripple/XRP identity crisis. A couple of years ago, executives at Ripple – the company – had no problem referring to their cryptocurrency as lower-case ""ripple."" But today, after the XRP rebrand, Ripple is twisting itself into rhetorical knots, trying to put its cryptocurrency at arm's length.  Fo' shizzle my ripizzle  Given that situation, it might seem strange that there was little attempt to draw a line at the party.  Ripple sponsored the event and booked the entertainment for XRP Community Night, employees in attendance told me. And about a third of the ""XRP community"" there were Ripple employees, all of whom wore t-shirts with the XRP logo – a disconnected X. The company logo graced the bar's cocktail menu. (Editor's note: Ripple contends its employees represented 10 percent of the audience, or 50 of the more than 450 registered attendees).  All this intermingling of Ripple and XRP was difficult to reconcile with scenes from a UK parliamentary hearing just a couple weeks prior, when Ripple's director of regulatory relations Ryan Zagone insisted, ""There's not a direct connection between Ripple the company and XRP.""  Ripple owns ""a significant amount of XRP"" – the majority – Zagone acknowledged, but that was ""gifted to us"" by XRP's open-source developers.  The reason for these gymnastics is that, if courts and regulators find the Ripple-XRP link to be tight enough, sales of XRP – totaling $168 million in the first quarter of this year – could be considered an unregistered securities offering. A lawsuit filed earlier this month, by an investor who bought XRP high and sold low, makes that allegation (the XRPArmy greeted the news on Twitter with cries of FUD! and a few unorthodox takes on securities law).  A Ripple lawyer at the party echoed some of that criticism, but used less colorful language. This is the kind of thing you can expect when there's so much money flying around, he said, presenting as Exhibit A the Lamborghinis lining the sidewalk at CoinDesk's Consensus conference uptown.  Some people build their careers by being at the cutting edge, he went on. Other people sue.  At this point, it was starting to look like Snoop Dogg might go on soon, performing for an invite-only crowd of perhaps a couple hundred techies and investors – speaking of money flying around. The smoke machines were starting up again, and what had been a faint whiff of weed was becoming truly difficult to ignore.  Here was the kind of opulence that whets litigious palates. Ripple spared no expense on the light show, and Snoop was accompanied for his hour-long set by a drummer, a bassist, some hype men – including Nasty Dogg (a man in a large foam dog head) – and two scantily-clad backup dancers.  One of the hype men handed out Snoop Lion rolling papers, a relic of the rapper's 2013 pivot to Rastafarianism. Snoop has distanced himself from that phase of his life now, much as Ripple has distanced itself from XRP. It seemed a fitting metaphor: both Ripple and Snoop were tossing out little tokens of that half-repudiated identity.  The difference is, in Ripple's case it's $168 million worth of little tokens. In Snoop's, it's perhaps $20.  ""They're Snoop coins,"" someone shouted, delighted, but they weren't.  The XRPArmy  I moved to the back of the venue to better acquaint myself with the XRP community, and spotted David Schwartz, Ripple's chief cryptographer, playing Super Mario pinball. He seemed busy.  A developer at an insurance company was free to talk, though. He used to be a ""decentralization maximalist,"" he said, meaning he had no patience for Ripple, but after reading the white paper, he warmed to XRP. Someone who works in business development at a South Korean crypto exchange said they were trialing xCurrent, which doesn't necessarily use XRP – but sure, he likes it.  A crypto wunderkind who said he was one of the first people to mine litecoin – not to mention being into ethereum before the presale – said he hates XRP. ""Never owned a single one."" Why was he there then? ""Snoop."" (His tone expressed incredulity, perhaps pity.)  Another crypto miner, this one in a zcash shirt, compared bitcoin to the sun and all other coins – presumably including XRP and excluding zcash – to parasites. Then again, he said he knows and likes some of the Ripple team: Schwartz and CTO Stefan Thomas, both of whom were into bitcoin early on.  A British banker said his employer was doing remittances from Britain to Mexico using XRP. He was too drunk to explain, though, and got distracted by a waiter with a plate of candy.  By this time Snoop was wrapping up. More than a couple of people had obeyed his injunctions to smoke weed. The men's bathroom line snaked down the hall and onto the staircase (as with many other crypto events, there was no line for the women's bathroom).  Where were the XRP true believers?  Then I spotted her, XRP Twitter's Defender of the Faith, Tiffany Hayden, taking a selfie with David Schwartz.  After they emerged, the three of us talked about Codius, Ripple Stefan's new project Coil and Consensus 2018 (Tiffany was still sporting her badge). That's when it came up that I work for CoinDesk.  ""Oh, that's why you recognized me,"" she said.  And then a voice behind me said the party was over.  As I made my way out onto the New York sidewalk, I felt like I hadn't gotten any closer to understanding what makes an XRP addict tick. But that's okay. The Snoop Dogg show was pretty sweet.
