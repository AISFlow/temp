42378210,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MyDh,1435354271,Bitcoin Opportunity Corp Backs Mexican Exchange Bitso,"Bitso has closed a seed funding round led by the Barry Silbert-backed investment fund Bitcoin Opportunity Corp and including undisclosed angel investors.  Launched in April 2014, Bitso recently acquired competitor Unisend Mexico as part of a bid to strengthen its market presence. Today, the company primarily offers an order-book exchange and Ripple gateway as well as a merchant processing product.  However, in statements, Silbert suggested that he sees the company's greatest asset as its position to help facilitate remittances to and from Mexico:  “Bitso is well-positioned to emerge as the region’s leader in bitcoin exchange and payments, and we are thrilled to partner with them to help build a big, important company in this emerging industry.""  According to data from Pew Research Center, remittances to Mexico are estimated at $22bn in 2013, though such figures have fallen since a peak in 2006 due to the US housing market crash and a decline in the US immigrant population.  Mexico receives 40% of all remittances from Latin America, according to Pew data.

42378209,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MyCR,1435353342,Ex-Coinbase Compliance Exec: Basic Questions Still Hold Back Bitcoin,"Digital gold, decentralized ledger, global currency – it's not easy to explain bitcoin in any setting, let alone to regulators or law enforcement officials.  If the task is any easier today, imagine attempting it in 2013. That was the challenge facing Coinbase's inaugural chief compliance officer (CCO) Martine Niejadlik. A former senior director at eBay and PayPal and senior manager of fraud prevention at Amazon, Niejadlik admits even she had trouble coming to terms with the tech.  ""Frankly, the first time [CEO] Brian Armstrong called me to tell me about Coinbase and bitcoin I thought he was nuts,"" she recalls. ""It took me some time, quite a bit of it, to understand why the technology could be very disruptive.""  Niejadlik ultimately took the role, overseeing Coinbase's compliance during a period of rapid expansion that saw the company's user base grow from 650,000 users in December 2013 to 2 million in January 2015. She left the company in February to take the ""greatest job in the world"" as a full-time parent.  During her time at Coinbase, she oversaw the company's implementation and management of compliance procedures, ensuring that the firm and its employees operated in accordance with internal and external policies.  One of the biggest challenges of overseeing compliance in this setting, she believes, is the difficulty that comes with fitting bitcoin into existing regulations.  Niejadlik told CoinDesk:  ""Basic questions such as 'What is bitcoin?', 'Is it money?', 'Is it currency?', 'Is it an investment tool?', 'Is it property?' don't have straightforward answers, and different state and federal regulations contain different terms and definitions.""  Niejadlik explained that this confusion is evidenced in how different US agencies have approached the subject, with the IRS treating it as property and FinCEN labeling it a currency. She went on to argue that there's a risk the compliance process will become more complicated should other global regulatory bodies follow a similarly diverse approach.  ""More clarity and solutions are on the way, but the main question is whether there will be consistent answers – it'll be tough for bitcoin companies if, for example, states, or even countries, take a different stance and there is a real possibility that could happen,"" she said.  Compliance pain points  While bitcoin companies face many of the same compliance issues as traditional financial services businesses, she said others are unique, including the relative difficulty companies have securing banking partnerships and the high cost of licensing.  Niejadlik noted that simply working with other financial institutions like insurance companies to obtain surety bonds or audited financials that need to be supplied was part of the company's recurring responsibilities.  ""The 'big four' are hesitant to sign off on things like whether a company is actually holding the bitcoin they say they are, think Mt. Gox, and for that matter, how to even properly account for such items on financial statements,"" she continued.  Elsewhere, burdens are placed on companies through mandates passed in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that aim to address money laundering and terrorist financing concerns.  ""It's not easy to build technology that can figure out who is a good guy and who is doing something illicit, or how to figure out if your user is the real person on the Office of Foreign Assets Control [OFAC] list or if he just happens to be an unlucky individual with the same name as someone on the list,"" she said.  Such systems, Niejadlik says, are expected to be in place from the time a company begins interacting with customers, necessitating that startups ""move quickly to implement solutions while working in parallel on their products"".  Media pressure  Creating additional difficulty is the state of conversation about the technology among the general public, which Niejadlik framed as overly focused on negative incidents.  ""There has been extensive media coverage of negative events such as Silk Road, Mt. Gox and other notable arrests and illegal activities,"" she said, arguing that this is state of affairs is ""uncomfortable"" to regulators, law enforcement and those seeking to work with the industry.  Niejadlik suggested that such negative press reinforces the heightened concerns of these parties, thus causing difficulties with what should be basic relationships for financial entities, though the coverage has not been without usefulness.  ""I think media attention to some of the negative events is important as it helps the public understand things such as why to not store private keys with a company developed to facilitate Magic The Gathering transactions,"" said Niejadlik. ""However, I do think proportionally there has not been enough attention to the benefits of the system and the good things happening in the bitcoin space.""  Other issues, she suggested, have arisen regarding how media outlets portray a company's statements, such as when Coinbase formally launched its exchange.  Striking a balance  A more delicate balancing act, she said, is ensuring that companies are succeeding on both compliance and usability, a task that is not always easy as evidenced by the sometimes public outcry over the actions of industry companies.  For example, Coinbase came under fire following Niejadlik's tenure for what was denounced as invasive information collecting on firms that process bitcoin transactions.  Niejadlik said that privacy requires ""ongoing internal conversations"" over what's best for the company from a regulatory and product standpoint, especially in light of the push by regulators to be more demanding of the compliance efforts of companies like Coinbase.  ""There is pressure coming from both new regulations [like the] NY BitLicense and from banks and their regulators to collect more data upfront, and that can unfortunately push users who are very concerned about privacy to services which are not regulated and may be less secure,"" she said.  Overall, she suggested that other professionals who fill a similar role in the industry would be wise to involve team members on both the compliance and product side in decision-making.  History repeated  Still, Niejadlik said that such challenges, while unique to the industry, are not dissimilar from those overcome by other the Internet's early success stories.  ""Every company has it's challenges and set of problems to work through. In the early days at Amazon we were battling things like fraudulent credit card purchases and account takeovers. At eBay it was a whole host of policy violations such as listing banned items and leaving feedback on your own listings,"" she recalls, adding:  ""Companies in the bitcoin space grapple with many of the same questions that PayPal did, and does, such as how to best balance consumer experience with mitigating compliance and fraud risks.""  Niejadlik said that bitcoin companies are now able to rely on services provided by large online e-commerce websites such as analytical, account takeover mitigation and spam email solutions.  Overall, she expressed optimism that the abilities of the technology would be highlighted as similar solutions for the industry are developed, concluding:  ""The challenge is that the systems to mitigate these risks are in various stages of development.""  Niejadlik declined to answer questions specific to her work at Coinbase.  Martine Niejadlik is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York.

42378202,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7My3d,1435337120,Kid-Friendly Minecraft Server Launches Bitcoin Economy,"A multi-player server on the wildly popular video game Minecraft has introduced bitcoin to its world as a way of teaching children about digital currency.  While in-game currencies exist in several different minecraft worlds, using bitcoin means that players can take their money out of the game and use it in the real world too.  The server, PlayMC, features an in-game currency called 'bits' which the company has set at 100,000,000th of a bitcoin (commonly known as a 'satoshi'). The unit was chosen for its ease-of-use, as it represents a whole unit and allows players to be rewarded seemingly on a larger scale.  With additional opportunities for players to spend their bits on classes, items and other additional content within the game, PlayMC says it provides a ""safe gaming environment for kids to enjoy and have the opportunity to earn their own money"".  Minecraft for the uninitiated  As the third best-selling video game of all time, Minecraft has sold over 60 million copies. Especially popular with younger people, it allows players and game developers to build worlds from 3D blocks not unlike digital Lego.  Everything in the game is based on these blocks, which can either be destroyed or moved and placed to create anything within a player's imagination. It is an open-ended world with a high degree of flexibility as to what is possible, though some elements of the world are consistent across the different games.  Players can play alone or connect to servers like PlayMC, allowing multi-player games and interaction in the online world with thousands of other players.  Plugins allow game creators to determine the nature of play and objectives of the game, which usually involves players acquiring resources in order to build tools and structures, and sometimes fight off enemies.  PlayMC's bitcoin economy  PlayMC's server has plugins that change the main Minecraft game into mini-games, where players either cooperate or fight against each other to win. Each game has different objectives and different ways for players to earn their bits.  A company spokesperson said:  ""For example in our game type 'ArcherGames' players fight each other in a last man standing game mode. Each player is rewarded a small amount of Bits for killing other players and if they come in first, second or third they are rewarded with a larger amount of Bits.""  As well as awarding bits for standard play actions like kills and wins, PlayMC also allows its players to earn them for winning tournaments and powerups, and in non-game actions like bug reporting, blog post writing, bounties, and acting as server staff.  No parents had yet approached the company for more information on bitcoin but plenty of young players have been actively trying to understand digital currency, the spokesperson said.  Most of the team's time is now spent clearing up misconceptions about bitcoin and providing links that explain bitoin in simple terms.  PlayMC also has an extensive explanation of bitcoin and its in-game 'Bitconomy' on the company website.  E-commerce for kids  PlayMC follows in the footsteps of other bitcoin-oriented Minecraft servers such as BitQuest, though PlayMC is aimed specifically at children.  One of bitcoin's touted advantages is the way it provides access to electronic payments to those under 18. Children generally have restricted access to banks or credit card accounts.  Of course, anyone wishing to turn their bits into fiat currency will still need to go through a bitcoin exchange, which have similar verification requirements to banks. This could actually promote a bitcoin-based economy by engaging users who can't easily escape it.  PlayMC was founded from a partnership between AcroMedia and developer Brandon Gordon, the latter of whom has been involved with Minecraft for five years and bitcoin for three. Given his personal interests, incorporating bitcoin into the game ""seemed like a no-brainer,"" he said.  The server was founded to introduce new levels of reliability to Minecraft, which often have an 'anything goes' reputation and servers come and go with regularity.  It boasts 99.9% uptime and is regularly updated to the latest Minecraft version. Its community is always able to make suggestions and the focus is being as kid-friendly as possible.

42378200,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7My2N,1435325983,FATF: Regulate Virtual Currency Exchanges to Counter Crime Risks,"The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has recommended closer monitoring of digital currency exchanges and gateways to counter money laundering and terrorism financing.  FATF published its 'Guidance for a risk-based approach to virtual currencies' at a plenary meeting held this week in Brisbane.  The 48-page document acknowledges that digital currencies carry several economic benefits such as decreased transaction costs, financial inclusion for those lacking access to banking services and the facilitation of microtransactions.  However, they also carry risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and ""other crime risks that must be identified and mitigated"", it warns.  The international anti-money laundering and terrorism financing watchdog held its third meeting for the year under its current Australian presidency.  What the report recommends  Adopting the standard description 'virtual currency payments products and services' (VCPPS), the latest FATF document singles out currency exchanges for examination, saying only these gateways represent a risk at present.  It urges its member nations to gain a greater understanding of how digital currencies and VCPPS function, performing their own risk assessments in order to identify potential risks and allocate resources. Different agencies and policy groups in each country should share knowledge in order to be more effective, it added.  The report recommends that all exchanges should be registered and licensed, subject to the same scrutiny as other financial institutions and money transfer businesses. Likewise, VCPPS should do the same due diligence as their traditional counterparts, and those accepting wire transfers from foreign countries should have adequate records of senders and beneficiaries.  If VCPPS or individuals that do not comply with the above requirements, FATF prescribes a ""range of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions"".  It acknowledges there are, however, difficulties presented by the largely anonymous (or pseudonymous) nature of a decentralized blockchain, as well as an inability to prevent payments for certain prohibited goods, or person-to-person transactions.  There should be international cooperation to assist countries more affected by ML/TF crimes, including confiscation of digital currencies and extradition assistance. Any suspicious activity should be reported to authorities, with customers' identity and digital currency addresses recorded.  Similar to the UK Home Office statements uncovered earlier this week, FATF also mentions the possibility of entirely new digital currencies being developed with built-in mechanisms to mitigate the added risks of decentralized currencies.  FATF and digital currencies  FATF  has had its eye on digital currency for some time, having mentioned ""decentralised digital currencies"" as a topic worthy of examination in a 2013 report.  It published a more focused report mid-2014 and in March this year it advocated for each digital currency to be evaluated separately on its attributes.  FATF has 36 members representing most of the world's major economies. It was established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorism financing and ""other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system"".  There is a rotating presidency among members, who hold plenary meetings three times every year. Its report on recommendations to combat money laundering and terrorist financing is published annually.  South Korea will take over the presidency from Australia starting July.

42378199,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Mxzr,1435323800,RBS Trials Ripple as Part of £3.5 Billion Tech Revamp,"The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is undertaking a proof-of-concept with Ripple technology as part of its £3.5bn technological revamp.  Chief administrative officer Simon McNamara announced the initiative during a webinar on the bank's three-year transformation plan last Thursday, just one day after a glitch which caused 600,000 payments to go missing.  The banking group, which has been plagued by a series of IT failures across its four brands, RBS, Natwest, Ulster Bank and Coutts, is now looking to boost its image as an 'innovation leader'.  Ripple is one of 24 other initiatives listed at the proof-of-concept stage with the bank. Logos from bitcoin startups Coinbase and Blockchain also feature further back in the RBS pipeline, under its 'qualification' stage.  Addressing the RBS investors and analysts on the webcast, McNamara said:  ""I don’t know what’s going to succeed. What I'm certain of is that we are going to see blockchain solutions, peer-to-peer solutions emerging in our industry and we want to be close to that development.""  Banking interest  Since Fidor went public with its Ripple integration in March last year, two US banks and three of Australia's 'big four' have expressed interest in using the peer-to-peer technology to streamline transfers.  According to McNamara's presentation, four teams of RBS experts spent two days exploring how the bank could use Ripple at one of its Technology Solutions Centres (TSC), later presenting their findings to business stakeholders.  RBA has been exploring other cryptocurrency angles as well: in collaboration with several Scottish universities and Design in Action, its Edinburgh TSC also housed a so-called 'Chiasma' where teams could win up to £20,000 to prototype business ideas related to the new technology.  The bank, which was briefly the world's largest prior to the global financial crisis, was bailed out by the UK government in 2008. Earlier this month, Chancellor George Osbourne said he would start selling (paywall) the state’s £32bn stake, despite a potential loss of £7.2bn for UK taxpayers.
