42378235,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Umxb,1438376633,Overstock Sells $5 Million Cryptobond to New York Trading Firm,"US retail giant Overstock has sold a $5m ""cryptobond"" to FNY Managed Accounts, a New York-based trading firm.  The sale  is part of a proof of concept from the Utah-based e-tailer showcasing how financial instruments can be digitized and traded on cryptographic distributed ledgers such as the bitcoin blockchain. Overstock first began accepting bitcoin in January 2014 and has since been one of the ecosystem's most active public advocates.  The project was first announced in April and later detailed further in June. At the time, the company announced that CEO Patrick Byrne had purchased a $500,000 cryptobond. Overstock has said it could sell as much as $25m in cryptobonds as part of the project.  The cryptobond sold to FNY will pay 7% interest over a five-year period. As an added security precaution, Overstock will issue a $5m loan to the firm with a 3% annual interest, an arrangement the company said would ""transfer the economic risk associated with the failure of the technology"". Both agreements come with their own put and call terms.  As part of the deal, the release suggested that FNY's HYDRATrade, its proprietary market access software, would integrate with Overstock's tØ.com cryptosecurities trading platform.  Overstock indicated that the reciprocal loan was unlikely to be extended to any future users of tØ.com. However, it specified the types of customers with which it will seek to do business going forward, writing:  ""The offering of the digital cryptodebt is being made exclusively to qualified institutional buyers that meet the definition of 'accredited investor'.""  Accredited investors were defined as those who are compliance with Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. Under the terms of the rule, Overstock said it may sell its securities to an unlimited number of accredited investors and up to 35 other purchasers.  Overstock also hinted at the complex regulatory process it expected to encounter when first launching its attempt to build a decentralized stock exchange last year, suggesting the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not approved the offering.  Overstock intends to hold a launch party to celebrate the issuance at NASDAQ's New York headquarters this Tuesday.

42378234,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7UmwL,1438364486,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Rolling With the Punches,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of bitcoin media coverage and its impact.  With celebrities playing an increasingly important role in modern culture, it is easy to see why their endorsement might add credibility to a new technology.  From serial entrepreneur and billionaire Richard Branson through to revelations that Hollywood A-lister Lucy Liu was in favour of distributed ledger technology, both digital currency and the blockchain have had their fair share of glitzy supporters.  This kind of attention though, as evidenced earlier this week, has not always been positive for bitcoin, with the media scrutinising its reputation yet again.  Elsewhere, one of the ecosystem's most ambitious projects, Ethereum, received little mainstream coverage despite it being 18 months and $18m in the making.  Bitcoin in the ring  Mike Tyson, the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, surprised his 4.9 million Twitter followers with his decision to lend his image to a bitcoin ATM.  Under other circumstances, this would probably have just been seen as yet another celebrity endorsement – but clearly bitcoin calls for special treatment.  To say that the digital currency needs a reputation makeover is probably an understatement, but is Tyson, the man who notoriously wasted away a $400m fortune the right person to do it?  It was not long before the mainstream media reacted to the announcement and subsequently begun to question its veracity. Interestingly, however, it was not Tyson's involvement that raised eye-brows among journalists, but the company behind the bitcoin ATM.  Duncan Riley, a SilliconANGLE reporter beat others to the punch as he shed some light on the new partnership:  ""Former heavyweight world boxing title holder Mike Tyson may be bitting off more than a rival's ear in August with the news over the weekend that he is apparently getting into the bitcoin ATM ring. But an investigation by SiliconANGLE has revealed that Tyson may have been scammed.""    The first issue, Riley noted, was with the domain's registration (miketysonbitcoin.com), thought to belong to Peter Klamka. According to the reporter, Klampa is listed as being the CEO of Bitcoin Brands, Inc, which encompasses two different business: Bitcoin for Miles, a site to buy airline frequent flyer miles; and the Bitcoin Vending Network, whose business offering is unclear.      Interestingly, Riley also found BitMD, another service offered by Bitcoin Brands Inc, which claims to provide bitcoin payment services for the medical marijuana industry.      ""Doesn't sound too bad in theory, and if it was providing those services it would be, but there's only one serious problem: We can't find any solid evidence, outside of the company's own press releases, that they are.""      The best guess, Riley speculated, was that Mike Tyson had ""been suckered into a deal by a fast talker who has promised him millions if he gets involved and lends his name to the enterprise, despite the company behind the enterprise having a market cap that is probably about half the value of one bottle of the champagne Tyson prefers to drink"".      Venture Beat echoed SilliconANGLE's findings, noting: ""Mike Tyson is either getting into the bitcoin game or is getting scammed out of a bunch of money.""      Despite the ongoing debate, Klampa spoke to CoinDesk and refuted the scam allegations. Under the condition they were not shared, he supplied images of the Mike Tyson branded ATMs, which he said were ready to launch at any time.      Additionally, he told CoinDesk that Tyson had an ""even split"" of equity due to the way the license was structured.    A tainted brand  Kudos goes to BTC China's Bobby Lee, who discussed bitcoin with Bloomberg's Rishaad Salamat this week.  ""We are discussing bitcoin as a brand, but I mean, it's a tainted brand, it doesn't have a leadership. It's been associated with this Mt Gox bankruptcy, it's been associated with volatility, money laundering etc. How do you get respectability for it and legitimacy?"" probed Salamat.  Samalat continued: ""You're hoping for stability, aren't you? Because with stability comes respectability and legitimacy and that's what you are really trying to get, isn't it Bobby?""  Then the inevitable happened. Samalat drew on the connection between bitcoin and the dark web, noting how Silk Road enabled users to buy drugs with bitcoin, adding that bitcoin's image had been ""tarnished.""  Lee tried to abate the criticism during the interview, representative of some of the misconceptions surrounding the digital currency – but to little avail.  Writing for the Huffington Post, Céline Hervieux-Payette, the former Leader of the Opposition in the Canadian Senate, wrote a piece titled ""Approach Bitcoin with Caution.""  She wrote:  ""There remain major security issues regarding bitcoin and digital currency which must be resolved before it can be considered safe. Despite all the fanfare I think there is some need for sober second thought.""  She continued: ""Criminals like bitcoin due to its unregulated and anonymous nature.""  If Lee had a chance to reply he would have probably repeated what he told Salamat. The reality, Lee said, is that it is hard to control what people use bitcoin for, just like it is hard to control what people use cash or the Internet for.  Pizza surprise    This week's most entertaining story was handed to the media by Daniel Sobey-Harker, a British man who spent over £350 worth of bitcoin on pizzas for strangers in the US during a drunken spree.  Although the crypto community has long celebrated the connection between bitcoin and pizza, it seems that the digital currency and the Italian culinary delight are destined to go hand in hand.  Or least that is what the mainstream media would have you believe.  The Mirror covered Harker's purchase in its ""Weird News"" section, perhaps unaware that this was not the first time bitcoin had been used to buy pizza online.  In his article, Alexander Lerche, said:  ""Daniel Sobey-Harker generously put a post on social media site Reddit offering to buy a pizza for someone in the US, but the 27-year-old got into a bit of hot water when he was struggling with payment options. He eventually purchased two digital bitcoins, completely unaware that they were worth £350.""  Although the focus of the articles was indeed Harker and his pizza purchases, the coverage also served to portray one of bitcoin's most valid use-cases: international payments.  ""After trying to buy pizza for someone in the States - he became frustrated by an inability to pay for said takeaway, resorting to the controversial online currency of bitcoin.""  Whether its with the help of celebrities, industry players or pizza, it seems bitcoin's credibility is still being questioned from all sides.

42378250,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7UnBR,1438358831,Deutsche Bank Letter Touts 'Expertise' in Blockchain Tech,"Deutsche Bank is exploring the use of the blockchain for a variety of potential applications, according to a recent letter from the German megabank.  The bank was one of a number of respondents to a call for evidence by the European Securities and Markets Authority, which is currently establishing how it will regulate digital currencies. The EU securities watchdog issued a request for feedback in April. The bank declined to comment when reached.  According to the letter, attributed to global head of regulatory policy Daniel Trinder, Deutsche Bank sees the blockchain as “an area where we have particular interest and expertise”, adding that it is not currently engaged in digital currency trading or issuance. The bank also pointed to a roadmaphttps://www.db.com/ir/en/images/Deutsche_Bank_Strategy_2020_27_April_2015.pdf it unveiled earlier this year in which it outlined plans to explore new financial technologies.    Deutsche Bank cited the following areas of potential blockchain application in its letter:    Fiat currency payment and settlement  Securities issuance and transfer – creation of unique identifiers, transaction tracking and asset segregation  Securities clearing and settlement – through delivery of more efficient post trade processing  Securities Asset Servicing – through automation of dividend/interest payments and corporate actions processing  Enforcing derivatives contract and improving derivatives clearing through smart contracts  Asset registries – without the need for a central administrative authority  Know your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering registries and surveillance  Creating transparency – and facilitating differentiated customer and regulatory reporting  The bank added:  “In addition to these specific applications, the introduction of distributed ledger technology has the potential to allow for more fundamental changes to pre and post trade work flows within banks with additional efficiency benefits flowing from that.”  Deutsche Bank noted that, in its opinion, the exploration of the technology remains in its early stage, particularly at institutional level.  “Which of these potential applications will turn out to be scalable and sustainable remains to be seen,” it wrote.  On regulation  Deutsche Bank recommended in the letter that regulators seek a balance between compliance and innovation, joining a chorus of organizations, institutions and individuals who have long called for financial tech experimentation to be supported rather than stifled by governments.  Specifically, the bank asked for regulators to “adapt rules to keep pace with innovation and avoid creating barriers to market entry through regulation”.  The bank wrote:  “It is important that in seeking to mitigate potential risks arising from new applications of the blockchain / distributed ledger technology, there is a proportionate approach taken and that an appropriate balance is struck between managing emerging risks and providing predictability for investment and space for continued innovation.”  Deutsche Bank also applauded the work of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the European Banking Authority and the UK Treasury in investigating digital currencies. The bank also voiced support for a proposal by the Financial Action Task Force to oversee exchange activity in Europe.  Blockchain work growing  Deutsche Bank noted in its letter that the blockchain ""has the potential to create new industry opportunities and disrupt existing technologies and processes"".  Beyond finance, it sees the use of the blockchain growing on the institutional level, citing the work of government bodies in the area of the blockchain.  Most notably, Deutsche Bank wrote that “Estonia, which reports the lowest rate of credit card fraud in the Euro zone, secures much of its banking infrastructure with a blockchain.”  A request for comment submitted to the country’s central bank was not returned by press time.  The bank also cited work by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Honduran government as other examples.

42378253,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7UnDx,1438352419,Microsoft's Bing Launches Bitcoin Rewards Sweepstakes,"A new partnership between Bing Rewards and Tango Card will let users of the search engine redeem reward points for the ability to win $500 in bitcoin.  Bing Rewards  awards credits to search engine users that can be redeemed for gift cards and other products, including entries into various consumer-oriented contests. The latest contest was made possible by Tango Card's recent partnership with bitcoin processing service SnapCard.  According to SnapCard co-founder Ioannis Giannaros, the drawing – for roughly 1.7 BTC at the time of writing – will run through the end of August.  Winners will be notified at the end of September.  Giannaros credits the Bing Rewards team as being ""progressive"" about the addition of bitcoin rewards, explaining:  ""There’s an exciting roadmap and we’re thrilled to be seeing this more 'adopting' approach to bitcoin. As a company of their size, they’re moving quick and really embracing it.""  The move suggests a broadening relationship between Microsoft, which owns Bing, and the digital currency. Microsoft added bitcoin as a payment option for digital content in December.  Bing usage accounted for 20% of US search traffic as of June, according to comScore. NetMarketshare reports that the search engine accounted for 9.83% of global traffic as of the same month.  Representatives for Tango Card and Bing Rewards were not immediately available for comment.

42378247,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Un7f,1438336165,You May Soon Get Bitcoin-Bought Cannabis Delivered by Drone,"A company near San Francisco has come up with a novel way to deliver bitcoin-purchased marijuana, via drone.    Trees,  which claims to sell the ""highest quality"" medicinal cannabis to people holding a medical recommendation, accepts payments in bitcoin alongside traditional payment methods such as cash, online bank transfer and credit cards.  A spokesperson for the company confirmed that drone deliveries were not currently available, due to local regulations. The drone delivery option, the spokesperson said, would be rolled-out in the future if and when the regulation around the flying devices settled. Currently users will get their packages delivered by ""old fashioned in-house drivers"".  For now, users are required to provide their Californian driving license and medical cannabis recommendation when ordering online. To get medical approval, consumers must have a short evaluation with a doctor, either online or at a clinic.  Users must give the medical reason for their use of cannabis, declare any pre-existing health conditions, confirm whether they've used cannabis before and state their preferred method of ingestion.  Customers can then choose from six different cannabis boxes, ranging in price from $59 to $149, all of which come with a certificate of authenticity.  Currently, Trees only delivers to customers in the San Francisco Bay area.  Although its proposed delivery method is nothing short of creative, Trees is not the first company to accept bitcoin payments for legal marijuana.  In April last year, the first marijuana vending machine in the US, was unveiled in the sate of Colorado.  State regulation  California was the first state to set a medical marijuana program, enacted by Proposition 215 in 1996 and Senate Bill 420 seven years later.  The Proposition, otherwise known as the Compassionate Use Act, approved by a majority vote, enabled cancer, AIDS and patients suffering from other chronic diseases to grow or obtain marijuana following recommendation by a licensed physician.  Aside from California and Colorado, medicinal cannabis is also legal in 21 other US states.
