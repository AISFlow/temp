32736295,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637212,1724367654,"Memecoin FLOKI Leads Crypto Market With 13% Surge, Here’s Why","The memecoin FLOKi is leading today’s crypto market with a rally of +12.8% in the last 24 hours, sharing the top spot with Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) which is up +12.2%. The price surge can be several developments and partnerships, most notably involving Binance and the upcoming airdrop of Simon’s Cat (CAT) token. #1 Binance Supports CAT Airdrop To FLOKI Holders Probably the most important factor fueling today’s FLOKI price rally is the announcement that Binance, the leading global crypto exchange, will support the airdrop for Simon’s Cat (CAT). The exchange’s decision to take a snapshot on August 29, 2024, is crucial for the airdrop distribution and has presumably ignited buying pressure from airdrop hunters. According to the official Floki blog: “As initially revealed in our official announcement about Simon’s Cat launch on TokenFi, Simon’s Cat has allocated 20% of the total CAT supply to the Floki community. This strategic move is expected to enhance both the visibility and liquidity of FLOKI tokens across platforms.” Related Reading: End Of The Slump? Floki Eyes A 46% Price Surge — Analyst The upcoming airdrop involves distributing approximately 315 billion CAT tokens, which constitutes 3.5% of the total Simon’s Cat token supply. Eligibility for the airdrop requires holders to maintain a minimum of 400,000 FLOKI tokens, with the distribution proportional to the amount of FLOKI held at the time of the snapshot. #2 FLOKI DAO Approves CAT Reserve Further bolstering FLOKI’s market position is the recent decision by the FLOKI DAO to allocate $200,000 USDT from its treasury for investing in Simon’s Cat Token. This move, approved by 97.72% of voting participants, could enhance the intrinsic value of FLOKI. The official statement released by the FLOKI DAO emphasized: “After a decisive vote by the FLOKI DAO, with 97.72% approval, Floki will allocate $200,000 USDT from the Floki Treasury to invest in the CAT token, which will be held as a strategic asset. This decision highlights our dedication to community-driven governance and decision-making.” #3 Market Sentiment And New Exchange Listing The crypto community has also been abuzz with talks of a new BNB memecoin season, a sentiment that has been supported by FLOKI’s official X account. The team wrote on Wednesday: Related Reading: Floki Inu To Build Schools In India, FLOKI Price Seen Hitting $17 “We’re hearing whispers of BNB season again. Here’s a reminder that FLOKI is the biggest memecoin on the BNB chain by far! Floki is bigger than every other memecoin on the BNB chain COMBINED and is partnered with the BNB chain. We’re excited about the BNB ecosystem and will continue to actively support it!” Additionally, major crypto exchange ByBit added the FLOKI / USDC trading pair yesterday. The exchange revealed the listing in response to strong demand, boosting Floki’s liquidity to over 40 MILLION users. “This addition will make it easier for ByBit’s massive user base to purchase FLOKI and interact with the FLOKI ecosystem,” the memecoin’s team remarked via X. #4 Bullish Chart Setup Technical analysis from popular crypto analyst CRG (@MacroCRG shows a bullish chart setup for FLOKI. The convergence of fundamental developments and technical indicators suggests a strong upward momentum. CRG stated: “FLOKI chart looks fkin delicious. Plus, lots of fundamental tailwinds to ignite momentum: CAT / @SimonsCatMeme launching today (BNB szn loading, FLOKI should be a huge beneficiary as it’s BNB’s flagship meme). Binance also confirmed to be airdropping a big chunk of CAT to FLOKI holders, bullish af. Full send.” At press time, FLOKI traded at $0.00014303.

Key Indicators Signal Potential $72K Target,"Bitcoin is seeing an uptick following its recent reclaim above the $60,000 mark in the past day. Amid this price performance, renowned crypto analyst Mags on Elon Musk’s social media platform X shared his latest asset analysis. According to Mags, Bitcoin could be poised for a major rally, driven by factors related to the USDT dominance (USDT.D) and the forming technical chart patterns. Related Reading: September 10: A Bitcoin Game Changer, Says Hedge Fund Founder Bitcoin On The Verge Of A $72,000 Rally? Mags explained that the inverse correlation between USDT dominance and Bitcoin’s price is a key indicator to watch. USDT dominance refers to the market share of Tether (USDT) in the overall cryptocurrency market, and its movements can often signal shifts in Bitcoin’s price. Mags pointed out that USDT.D recently broke down from a strong trendline support and is currently testing the point of breakdown, which could lead to forming a bear channel. Meanwhile, Bitcoin forms a broadening wedge pattern, typically seen as a bullish continuation signal. If USDT.D continues to decline, Mags anticipates that Bitcoin could see a notable “leg up,” potentially pushing the price to $72,000 or higher. #Bitcoin pump incoming ?

In addition to the technical indicators, another factor contributing to the growing anticipation of a Bitcoin price surge is the recent increase in market volatility. Bitcoin’s volatility has surpassed levels not seen in the past months and has continued to rise, which could be a potential catalyst for Bitcoin to see a significant break out towards the upside. Crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades highlighted this development in a recent X post, noting that after a period of low volatility, Bitcoin’s volatility levels are ramping back up, approaching the levels seen earlier this year during the asset’s all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s MVRV Ratio Nears Critical Death Cross: Will The Market See A Bearish Shift? Daan Crypto Trades emphasized that this volatility increase is needed to end Bitcoin’s consolidation, potentially leading to a decisive price movement in one direction or the other. #Bitcoin After a big slump in volatility levels, it’s now ramping back up and getting close to levels we saw earlier this year at the all time highs.

Ahead of the upcoming upgrade, ADA, the native token of the Cardano ecosystem, has exploded by over 52% in this key metric. Cardano Releases Date For Chang Upgrade Intersect, a member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem, took to X (formerly Twitter) on August 20 to provide comprehensive details and updates on the Chang hard fork. The organization has unveiled key dates for the Chang upgrade launch, highlighting that the majority of preparations are already finalized. Related Reading: Ethereum Metrics Turn Positive: Can This Drive A New ATH Above $5,000? According to Intersect, the Chang hard fork group held a meeting recently to review and discuss the progress of the project’s desired thresholds and to gather valuable feedback from the Cardano community. With most of the preparations complete, they have proposed the first set of dates for the hard fork on the production mainnet. The target date for “the Chang #1 hard fork” is set for Tuesday, August 27. However, a final decision on whether or not to proceed with this date will be made on Friday, August 23. The official date has been decided based on the readiness of certain key metrics, which have shown steady progress over the past weeks. Intersect disclosed that the Chang hard fork group has verified and confirmed that the key components and tooling for the upgrade are set. This includes readiness of the Stake Pool Operator (SPO), exchange liquidity, and updates from Decentralized Applications (DApps). The team has affirmed that all components have exceeded expectations. Furthermore, intersect noted that the formal process for initiating the hard fork will begin with a four-day lead time to conclude all necessary governance actions and approvals. In the case of a change of dates, the Chang hard fork team has revealed that the next appropriate window for the upgrade would be on September 3, 2024. However, for now, all current indications suggest that August 27 is the most viable date for the Chang hard fork launch. In preparation, pre-production will be a hard fork on August 22. ADA Surges Over 52% In A Key Metric On August 21, Cardano’s native token, ADA, witnessed an unprecedented rise in overall trading volume. Coinglass reports that the cryptocurrency jumped over 54% at the time, underscoring the rising trading activity and interest from investors. This unexpected volume increase could be signaling a shift in Cardano’s price dynamics. Over the past months, the price of ADA has been on a seemingly never ending consolidation phase. However with its surging volume, the cryptocurrency may be indicating a potential end to its price stagnation. Related Reading: Historical Data Suggests Bitcoin Could Rise 1,000%, Here’s Why Although ADA’s volume rose above 54% previously, the cryptocurrency’s current trading volume is up by 36.21%, at around $428.88 million, according to Coinglass. ADA’s open interest is also witnessing a slight upward momentum, increasing by 4.66%. Including the upcoming Chang upgrade, these positive changes in the cryptocurrency’s metrics could be fueling Cardano’s recent price increase in the last 24 hours. CoinMarketCap data shows that ADA’s price has jumped 4.74% and is presently trading at $0.368.

42417365,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYDTZ,1724358678,From Chaos to Crypto: The Crecimiento Movement Igniting Argentina,"Today, Argentina stands on the brink of a technology renaissance. Long a symbol of economic instability, Argentina is now emerging as the world’s testbed for economic transformation, through crypto.  Amid soaring inflation and crippling debt, Argentina is turning to crypto as a tool to stabilize its economy and drive growth. As the U.S. retreats from its leadership role in crypto, Argentina is seizing the opportunity to step into the void.  At the heart of this transformation is the Crecimiento movement uniting crypto believers, entrepreneurs, and innovators working toward sustainable, crypto-driven reform. With a newly-elected President showing interest in crypto’s potential, Crecimiento is harnessing crypto to help reshape the economy, focusing on payments, credit, property, and more.  Crecimiento’s bold vision is coming to life at Aleph, a month-long pop-up city in Buenos Aires where over 2,000 Argentine and global founders, builders, investors, and policy leaders have gathered to launch crypto startups and fuel innovation.  Argentina’s economy  Argentina’s economic narrative is one of stark contrasts. Once among the world’s wealthiest nations in the early 20th century with a higher per capita income than Germany and France, Argentina now grapples with the world’s highest inflation and a depreciating peso impacting economic confidence. To illustrate: $100,000 in Argentine pesos from 1995 would be worth about $310 today.  But Argentina’s high crypto adoption (4th globally), a thriving crypto ecosystem with companies like OpenZeppelin, Ripio and RSK, and a supportive political environment are now converging to position the country as a digital leader.  This grassroots embrace of crypto, coupled with a government eager to experiment with financial innovation, means Argentina is positioned to pioneer a new crypto-enabled frontier.  A testbed for crypto-powered transformation  Born out of the 2008 financial crisis, crypto was designed to decentralize control, breaking away from traditional financial systems that are often opaque, centralized, and prone to failure.  In Argentina, where economic and social structures have left many behind, crypto offers not just a financial lifeline but a blueprint for a new kind of society. It’s a chance to rethink how communities function, how opportunities are distributed, and how trust is built.  Argentina's economic challenges have unlocked a wave of crypto experimentation. More than a third of the population uses crypto for everyday transactions and the country also has seen the highest number of crypto-paid employees in the world, with over 50% of the freelance economy powered by crypto in recent years.  These aren’t just abstract statistics; they represent a population that has already embraced the technology as a practical tool for daily life. From stablecoins that combat inflation to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that provide access to global markets, to on-chain tools offering mortgages and access to credit, Argentina is proving crypto can be a viable alternative to broken financial systems.  Filling the U.S. regulatory void  As the U.S. regulatory environment drives crypto innovation and talent offshore, an opportunity for global leadership has emerged. Some economies have been moving first to fill this void through specific crypto-first initiatives – like Abu Dhabi’s Hub71, Zug’s Crypto Valley, Brazil’sDrex CBDC – though these efforts are still isolated.  Argentina is adopting a more comprehensive approach to digital assets under President Javier Milei, who is attracting foreign investment and eliminating legal tender laws to promote the use of crypto. Recent reforms, such as approving the tokenization of certificates – enabling the creation of LLCs entirely using crypto, highlight this shift.  Unlike the U.S., Argentina’s regulators, including the CNV (Securities Commission), BCRA (Federal Reserve), and UIF (equivalent to U.S. FinCEN), are actively engaging with the crypto industry to improve clarity and operations. The CNV has clarified private offerings and, with UIF, established a Virtual Assets Service Provider Register. And the BCRA is considering lifting its 2022 ban on crypto services. This collaborative effort is driving the creation of a nationwide sandbox for crypto experimentation and revising the Incentive Regime for Large Investments (RIGI) to extend incentives to tech and crypto innovations, led by the Crecimiento movement.  A movement for economic rebirth  Crecimiento’s core contributors have been hard at work for months problem-solving and conducting research to identify crypto-enabled solutions to Argentina’s hardest economic frictions.  The aim is to revolutionize lending, insurance, supply chains, taxation, and digital identity, to bring the next 10 million people on-chain with innovative products, expand Argentina’s startup ecosystem, and establish a regulatory framework for 20 years of stability for startups.  Aleph: Pop Up City Catalysing Argentine Innovation  Crecimiento’s ambitions are being kickstarted through Aleph, a month-long pop-up city transforming Buenos Aires into the epicenter of global crypto innovation.  Throughout August, more than 300 talks, events, hacks, and Asados are unfolding, all focused on catalyzing crypto solutions and catalyzing innovation.  Aleph is home to 67 promising startups, ranging from pre-seed to Series A, handpicked by Crecimiento to tackle Argentina’s most pressing challenges. These include projects bringing housing rentals and RWAs on-chain, tokenizing financial receivables, and creating new yield-bearing stablecoins.  These startups are building alongside with Argentine crypto pioneers like Demi Brener (OpenZeppelin), Seba Serrano (Ripio), Mariano Conti (Maker), Marcelo Cavazzoli (Lemon), and Santi Siri (Democracy Earth), alongside global leaders like Juan Benet (Protocol Labs), Alex Gluchowski (ZKsync), and David Hoffman (Bankless).  Aleph has captured global attention, earning praise from leaders like Buenos Aires' Chief of Government, Jorge Macri. A prominent crypto founder also called it “a torch of freedom to the world.”  Aleph is driving innovation with decentralized identity credentials via QuarkID, its ERC-20 token MORFI —accepted at 25+ merchants — and more. Officially recognized as of ""Scientific, Technological, and Economic Interest"" by Buenos Aires, Aleph is not just a meetup but a hub of innovation, accelerating startups, forging partnerships, and fueling Crecimiento’s momentum.  Aleph buzzes with the energy of a future that's within reach. A feeling that Argentina's crypto evolution is not just a possibility; it's an unstoppable force, and the Crecimiento movement is helping drive a new paradigm.  For Argentina to claim its role as a global crypto leader, it needs the support of the entire ecosystem. If you believe in crypto's power to create a more equitable world, Argentina is where you need to be.

42417353,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYDG9,1724357755,Meeting Binance CEO Richard Teng,"Yesterday, CoinDesk was lucky enough to sit down with Richard Teng, the new CEO of Binance. It was a chance for us to meet with the man entrusted to run the world’s biggest crypto company at a fascinating time. Teng, a former regulator, was appointed last year as Binance reached a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities for violating sanctions and anti-money laundering regulations. He replaced CZ, Binance’s larger-than-life founder, who is currently serving a four month prison sentence in California.  My colleague Cheyenne Ligon wrote up the interview yesterday (the headline was that Binance, unlike other large crypto companies, is not currently considering an IPO). Here are some other takeaways along with some personal impressions.  Teng Is Not CZ  CZ always gave the impression of being the man in charge, the operational and spiritual leader of Binance. Teng is a different sort of CEO. He deflected questions about technology and future plans to other managers, and Teng made a point of saying that Binance was now a more decentralized company. “Today, the organization is quite different from the one CZ led. It was a founder-led organization, CZ was running it,” Teng told us. “Right now, it’s a totally different corporate structure. It’s a board-led organization. We have three independent directors on board, we have a talented crew of very senior experienced executives for day-to-day operations at the company.”  Teng was a financial regulator in his native Singapore as well as the United Arab Emirates. He was appointed CEO because he understands regulation and regulators. The challenge for Binance is to convince authorities that it can be trusted on money laundering and other sensitive issues. It’s investing heavily in compliance. Teng, who has a graceful, unflappable manner, is the man for the hour.  No HQ yet  CZ famously used to say that Binance was a “global company,” by which he meant not only did it operate around the world, but really was of the world, as opposed to any one country. Since Binance got into regulatory strife, that line has shifted: Binance is now looking for a home. But Teng said it hasn’t made a decision on where yet.  “We have not decided on the global headquarter issue. It is very important, it is very complex. We need to be quite thoughtful in understanding the impact on the various stakeholders,” he said. Regulation and taxation consequences seemed to be top-of-mind in those deliberations.  Asked why Binance now wanted an HQ, Teng said: “I think global headquarters is really to give assurance to regulators on the shape and form and the direction of travel for the company. It’s similar to a board of directors.”  Running a global crypto business is… complicated  U.S. crypto companies often complain about the uncertainty of doing business in the U.S, given the lack of legislation and that regulators at the SEC and the CFTC have been slow to give clear guidance to what is and isn’t permissible when it comes to digital assets. Imagine running a business around the world where there are many jurisdictions with that lack of clarity. Binance has 19 licenses around the world, with recent approvals in Thailand, India and Brazil. That’s a lot of cultural and legal complexity.  Take Nigeria, for instance, where Tigran Gambaryan, an American employee of Binance, is currently detained. Nigeria claims, without evidence, that crypto was responsible for devaluing the naira and law enforcement there has accused Gambaryan of money laundering and tax evasion. According to the BBC, Nigeria has asked for $10 billion in return for his release, which, frankly, sounds a lot like a ransom demand.  ""Tigran has been unjustly held for close to half a year now,"" Teng told us. ""He needs medical treatment before his conditions become permanent.""  No IPO planned  As the current crypto cycle took shape with the ETF approvals and the Bitcoin halving in the last six months, it was rumored that several large crypto companies would look to go public. But while giants like Circle are getting ready, Binance is happy with its current ownership structure, Teng said.  “We are in very strong financial shape, so there’s really no need for us to consider any fundraising or an IPO at this time. Since the fifth month of Binance’s operation [in 2017], it has been profitable, and it has been very prudent in terms of spending. So [an IPO] is not a subject that has come up.”  Not coming back to the U.S. – for now  We wondered if and when Binance might consider returning to the United States (it currently has no license here). Perhaps a Donald Trump victory, which many think will create a more favorable environment for crypto, might be a precipitating factor? Teng said there were no current plans. “Our business is outside of the U.S. So we watch with excitement what’s happening in the U.S., but it has no bearing on our business whatsoever.” Teng said the U.S. remains an “important market” but Binance does not appear to be rushing back, given all the problems it’s had with regulators here in the last couple of years. But luckily Teng still wants to travel here, so we and others can talk to him about Binance and crypto’s future.

The world’s leading cryptocurrency has been on a wild ride, with its price fluctuations going haywire during the past few weeks. Related Reading: Tron Rises 24% Amid New Developments – Will The Uptrend Continue? Bullish Factors Driving Bitcoin Price One major driver behind the recent price surge in Bitcoin is the understanding that a spot Bitcoin ETF is likely to be approved by the SEC. With immense anticipation of such a decision from the SEC, which is likely to finally open the door for increased institutional investments in the cryptocurrency, many investors are risking an entrance at the current levels. Another factor that has been driving Bitcoin’s price has been the reduction in new BTC supply following the halving event in the second half of 2024. Generally, prices for Bitcoin have soared after halving by multiples, since the reduced supply directly correlates with higher demand and price. #bitcoin 200wma over $38k pic.twitter.com/olAw6BOjgz — Adam Back (@adam3us) August 21, 2024 Bitcoin’s 200-Week Moving Average Provides Strong Support Blockstream CEO Adam Back explained that the 200-week moving average of Bitcoin had risen past $38,000, a level that now provides solid support for the cryptocurrency. Indeed, the 200MA has repeatedly been treated as one of the most important indicators in Bitcoin analysis since the cryptocurrency never went below this moving average. Another revealing metric as far as new Bitcoin gains are concerned would be the holding patterns of the asset. According to information published by the online site BTCDirect, 69% of BTC supplying has not moved for a year or even longer. Of course, another instance of a lessening volume of BTC in circulation helps to alleviate selling pressure on the asset further, cementing a bullish thesis for Bitcoin. Bearish Factors To Consider At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $61,245, up 3.0% in the last 24 hours, and sustained a 4.7% gain in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Despite the recent price spike in Bitcoin, there are some bearish factors that remain in the background, one of which is the Mt. Gox repayments that are likely to put more selling pressure into the market. Earlier in the week, the infamous exchange made another whopping transfer to Bitstamp, setting off possible selling pressure.

According to court documents filed in a Florida court last week, CluCoin’s founder – 40-year-old Austin Michael Taylor of Maryland – admitted to regularly transferring funds earmarked for CluCoin-related projects to his own personal crypto wallets and then transferring them to online crypto casinos.  Taylor founded CluCoin in the spring of 2021, marketing the project to his “large Internet following” as a streamer as a way to fund charities. After CluCoin’s subsequent ICO that May, the project’s trading volume and value declined “precipitously,” according to court documents, prompting Taylor to steer CluCoin “away from its original charity focus.”  Over 2022, while he was managing CluCoin and making promises to investors about its activities – including the purported development of a metaverse-based video game called “Xenia” – his lawyers said, Taylor was “secretly succumbing to a gambling addiction.” In total, he transferred $1.14 million worth of investor funds to online casinos including Stake.com, his lawyers said.  In January 2023, Taylor publicly admitted to using investor funds for online gambling and voluntarily ceded control of the project to his business associates.  He pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud on Aug. 15. As part of his plea agreement, Taylor agreed to forfeit $1.14 million in ill-gotten gains for victim restitution.

42417357,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYDKH,1724354469,Crypto Promoter and Failed Politician Michelle Bond Accused of Illegally Taking FTX Cash,"A once-prominent crypto advocate, Michelle Bond, has been indicted for taking illegal money from her former FTX executive boyfriend, Ryan Salame, to back her congressional campaign in 2022.  Bond, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer, was the CEO of a crypto trade group in Washington.  Michelle Bond, who once ran a Washington-based crypto advocacy group and had served as a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer, was indicted in federal court for taking illegal campaign contributions during her 2022 run for Congress, and court documents detail how a river of cash came through her former FTX executive boyfriend.  Bond was accused in an indictment unsealed on Thursday of several counts of illegal handling and acceptance of campaign donations, tied to former senior executive Ryan Salame. She was also said to have filed ethics documents on behalf of the campaign that made bogus claims about the source of her money.  A court clerk told CoinDesk that Bond was expected to be presented before a magistrate judge in Manhattan around 3 p.m. EDT on Thursday.  Salame wasn't named in the court papers, but the description matches the ex-CEO of Bahamas-based FTX Digital Markets, who received a 7.5-year sentence in a plea deal that Salame now argues was supposed to protect Bond. Salame's lawyers contend that his guilty plea for campaign finance violations and running an unlicensed money transmitting business was meant to halt the case against Bond. (A judge scheduled a hearing on this issue for next month.)  Read More: Former FTX Executive Ryan Salame Claims Government Backtracked on Plea Deal: Filing  The indictment against Bond in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York was dated earlier this week.  Bond, who has made a recent effort to return to commenting on crypto policy affairs, declined to comment through a representative. Salame didn't immediately respond to a request for comment sent through his lawyers.  Salame and Bond have a child together, and the couple was often featured during Bond's failed Republican campaign for a New York seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. The two sought to associate themselves at the time within the circles of former President Donald Trump, and she was endorsed by son Donald Trump Jr.  A self-funded candidate has to ensure under election rules that they are using their own money. Bond is accused of taking several payments in 2022, some of them in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.  ""I just wanted to say thank you so much for paying that [consulting firm] invoice…really appreciate this, means a lot,"" Bond texted to Salame in February 2022, according to the indictment.  He's said to have responded, ""If you're thanking me for that. … the expenses on you actually running … going to get me so much love <3.""  Her campaign raised more than $1.5 million, according to Federal Election Commission records, but the vast bulk of that allegedly came from Bond herself. The indictment argues virtually all of it originated as payments from Salame or FTX, which subsequently collapsed in one of the most consequential failures in the industry's history. After some of the allegations emerged of an improper financial connection to FTX, Bond resigned as the CEO of the Association for Digital Asset Markets (ADAM).  Though she spent about the same as her Republican primary opponent and was backed by about $1.3 million in advertising paid for by the crypto industry, she managed to bring in less than 30% of the vote.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/22/crypto-promoter-and-failed-politician-michelle-bond-accused-of-illegally-taking-ftx-cash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc88cd03af74ce80259c4fc401d75edeba5cba03-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SIC could impose economic sanctions and apply the temporary or definitive closure of Worldcoin in Colombia.  Colombia's Superintendence of Industry and Commerce (SIC) has accused the decentralized identity project Worldcoin and the company behind it, Tools for Humanity, of alleged violations of the personal data protection regime, the agency said in a statement released Tuesday.  The SIC's notification against Worldcoin consists of a first act of indictment that is initiated without formal accusation. “The purpose of the proceedings is to determine whether the investigated companies have infringed the Colombian personal data protection regime in the collection of sensitive personal data in relation to the implementation of personal data processing policies and privacy notices,” the SIC detailed.  According to its website, Worldcoin, a crypto startup founded by OpenAI's Sam Altman, is currently collecting data of individuals with its Orb device in 25 locations in Colombia, including the capital, Bogota, and six other cities, such as Medellin, Cartagena, and Barranquilla.  If Worldcoin were found guilty, the SIC could impose economic sanctions to temporary suspension (for six months) or immediate and definitive closure of its operation, the agency said.  Different governments in Latin America have already started investigating Worldcoin's initiatives. In August, just two months after Worldcoin began operating in Ecuador, the country's central bank issued a reminder that “crypto assets are not a currency.”  In August 2023, the Argentine Agency for Access to Public Information (AAIP) initiated an inquiry targeting Worldcoin to ascertain the legality of its data collection practices.

This significant gain comes after two weeks of sideways consolidation, signaling a potential shift in momentum. Related Reading: Chainlink Drops by 64% In 5 Months, LINK Holders Unfazed: They Are Rapidly Accumulating As LINK rallies, data from Santiment, a leading crypto data intelligence platform, reveals that some daily traders are already taking profits, capitalizing on the recent price increase. This profit-taking activity highlights investors’ cautious optimism as LINK’s price gains momentum and reaches technical resistance in the 4-hour timeframe. LINK’s On-Chain Transaction Volume Showing Profit-Taking LINK’s daily profit-to-loss transaction volume has reached its highest level since July 14, with the ratio at 5.986. This means there are nearly six transactions in profit for every transaction in loss, signaling that short-term holders are actively taking profits following the recent move up. Such a high ratio indicates that investors are capitalizing on a significant price increase or relief rally, locking in gains as the market tests key levels. This profit-taking trend reveals the dynamics prevailing among traders, even as LINK’s price continues to gain momentum in the market. With the token testing local supply around the $11.40 mark, the market sentiment is one of careful anticipation. Traders are keenly aware of the delicate balance between further gains and potential pullbacks. Investors will watch for signs of a sustained breakout or a potential reversal as LINK approaches this threshold. The outcome at this level could set the tone for LINK’s price action in the coming days, making it a critical juncture for traders and investors alike. Technical Details: LINK Price In Critical Level LINK is trading at $11.31 after breaking a local high of $10.83 set on August 8, confirming an uptrend on the daily time frame. The price rally paused at $11.40, right at the 4-hour (4H) 200 exponential moving average (EMA), underscoring the significance of this technical indicator in lower time frames. This indicator acts as a dynamic support or resistance level, often indicating the trend in lower time frames. For LINK, reclaiming this level is crucial to confirm bullish momentum. For LINK Bulls to maintain momentum, the next crucial step is to retake the 4H 200 EMA and aim for $13. Conversely, if LINK fails to consolidate above this indicator, it could lead to a retest of the previous resistance at $10.83 and potentially a dip to the higher low around $9.90. Related Reading: Analyst Says Chainlink Price Could Climb To $19 — Here’s How Despite some day traders locking in profits, this activity should be seen as a sign of healthy profit-taking after a modest rally. The current price action reflects a market in consolidation, with traders closely watching for the next move. As LINK hovers near critical levels, the coming days will be pivotal in determining whether the uptrend continues or if a pullback is on the horizon.

32728823,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637324,1724350746,Crypto Investors Look To Become Millionaires With Pepe Unchained and Mpeppe,"The world of cryptocurrency is often seen as a place where fortunes can be made overnight, and the current buzz around Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a testament to that. As both tokens continue to gain traction in their presale stages, investors are flocking to these new opportunities with hopes of achieving significant returns, possibly even millionaire status. Here’s a closer look at why these two projects are capturing so much attention. Pepe Unchained (PEPU): A New Powerhouse in the Meme Coin Space Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has quickly emerged as one of the most promising meme coins of 2024, drawing comparisons to earlier successes like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, unlike many of its predecessors, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) brings more to the table than just hype. The project has already raised nearly 10 million in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), a clear indicator of strong investor confidence. One of the key factors driving this enthusiasm is the fact that Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is launching its own Layer 2 blockchain for Ethereum. This strategic move sets PEPU apart from other meme coins, which typically rely on established blockchains like Ethereum or Solana without adding any substantial value. By introducing its own blockchain, Pepe Unchained is positioning itself to create an entire ecosystem of new tokens and decentralized applications (dApps), further enhancing its long-term potential. The project also offers a staking function with an impressive annual percentage yield (APY) currently exceeding 200%. This high staking reward has led to a significant portion of PEPU tokens being locked in the staking pool, reducing the number of tokens available for trading at launch. This scarcity could lead to a substantial price surge once PEPU hits the exchanges, making early investors very optimistic about the future. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Underdog with Massive Potential While Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is making waves, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quietly positioning itself as another meme coin with the potential for massive returns. Currently priced at 0.001777 in its third presale stage, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already raised over 1.17 million, with its price set to increase in the next stage. The combination of a low entry price and a promising growth trajectory makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) an attractive option for investors looking to replicate the success seen with previous meme coins. Mpeppe (MPEPE) also offers a compelling incentive for early investors with a 20% bonus on purchases made using the promo code MPEPE20. This bonus, combined with the low initial price, gives investors an excellent opportunity to maximize their returns as the project gains momentum. With the presale rapidly approaching its next stage, the window to invest at the current price is closing, adding urgency to the opportunity. Why Investors Are Betting Big on These Tokens For many crypto investors, the allure of becoming a millionaire lies in identifying and investing in projects with high potential before they explode. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are both at the forefront of this new wave of meme coins, each offering unique advantages that make them stand out in a crowded market. Pepe Unchained (PEPU): Nearly 10 million raised in ICO, indicating strong investor confidence. Launching its own Layer 2 blockchain for Ethereum, setting the stage for an ecosystem of new tokens and dApps. High staking rewards with an APY currently over 200%, attracting long-term holders and reducing sell pressure at launch. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Low entry price at 0.001777, with potential for significant appreciation as the project matures. Generous 20% bonus for early investors using promo code MPEPE20. Rapidly approaching the next presale stage, which will see an increase in token price. The Road to Potential Millions As the presales for both Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) continue to gain momentum, the potential for significant returns becomes increasingly evident. With PEPU’s innovative approach to the meme coin space and MPEPE’s strategic incentives for early investors, both tokens offer unique opportunities for those looking to capitalize on the next big thing in crypto. The key takeaway for investors is the importance of timing and early participation. Those who get in now stand to benefit the most, particularly as both projects move closer to their respective exchange listings. Whether you’re drawn to the technological innovation of Pepe Unchained (PEPU) or the attractive entry point of Mpeppe (MPEPE), the potential for 100x returns is clear.

32728642,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637322,1724350430,"Render Holders See Bigger Returns With Mpeppe (MPEPE), Let’s Take A Deeper Look","Render (RENDER) holders, in particular, are starting to diversify their portfolios, eyeing new tokens that offer the potential for substantial returns. One such token that has caught their attention is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rising star in the crypto world with the promise of 100x returns. Let’s dive into why Render (RENDER) holders are increasingly turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as their next big bet. Render (RENDER): A Key Player in the AI Crypto Space Render (RENDER) has made significant strides as a decentralized GPU rendering network, providing digital creators with access to powerful computing resources. The platform has been particularly appealing to industries such as film and gaming, where high-quality graphics rendering is crucial. Render (RENDER) leverages idle GPU power, allowing digital artists to tap into cost-effective and scalable rendering services. However, despite its strong foundation and growth, Render (RENDER) is currently facing market pressures. Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report, expected on August 28, 2024, is a significant event for the AI sector, including cryptocurrencies like Render (RENDER). Investors are closely monitoring how these earnings might influence the price trajectory of Render (RENDER), with some analysts predicting a potential 100% rally. Yet, amidst this anticipation, Render (RENDER) holders are exploring new avenues to maximize their returns. Why Render (RENDER) Holders Are Turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) High Growth Potential: While Render (RENDER) continues to be a strong player in the AI and digital rendering space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a different kind of potential—one that is rooted in the explosive growth often seen with meme-inspired tokens. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has garnered attention for its unique blend of community-driven growth and strategic marketing, making it a prime candidate for those looking to capitalize on the next big meme coin phenomenon. Early Entry Advantage: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is still in its early stages, with a current price of just $0.001777. This low entry price provides an attractive opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next 100x token. Render (RENDER) holders, who may have already seen substantial gains, are now looking to replicate that success by investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE) before it potentially takes off. Diversification Strategy: For Render (RENDER) investors, diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a strategic move. While Render (RENDER) is tied to the AI and digital rendering market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) taps into the lucrative and rapidly growing meme coin sector. This diversification not only spreads risk but also positions investors to benefit from the unique growth drivers of each token. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Next Big Thing? Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly become a hot topic in the crypto community, particularly among those who have already seen success with other meme-inspired tokens. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its well-planned roadmap, which includes partnerships with influencers, strategic marketing campaigns, and a strong social media presence. These efforts have helped Mpeppe (MPEPE) build a loyal and engaged community, a critical factor in the success of any meme coin. Moreover, the token’s low price and high potential returns have made it an attractive option for investors who are looking to make significant gains in a short period. With the ongoing buzz and growing interest, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is well-positioned to become the next breakout star in the meme coin world. Conclusion: The Strategic Move for Render (RENDER) Investors As Render (RENDER) holders look ahead to Nvidia’s earnings and the potential impact on their investments, many are also turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE). This shift highlights the importance of diversification in the ever-changing cryptocurrency market. By investing in both Render (RENDER) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), investors can balance their portfolios with assets that offer stability and high-growth potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a unique opportunity to achieve substantial returns, making it an appealing choice for savvy investors looking to maximize their gains in the crypto market.

32728454,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637320,1724349977,"Crypto Whales Have Topped Up On These 3 Cryptocurrency ICP, RENDER & MPEPE","Recently, three cryptocurrencies—Internet Computer (ICP), Render (RNDR), and Mpeppe (MPEPE), have caught the attention of these deep-pocketed investors. Here’s why these tokens are becoming the go-to investments for crypto whales. Internet Computer (ICP): The Backbone of Web 3.0 Internet Computer (ICP) is making waves as one of the most innovative projects in the blockchain space. Founded by the Dfinity Foundation, Internet Computer (ICP) aims to reinvent the internet as a decentralized global computer that can run applications with the speed and efficiency of today’s centralized internet giants. The vision behind Internet Computer (ICP) is to replace the traditional IT stack, providing a more secure, scalable, and decentralized alternative. One of the key reasons crypto whales are flocking to Internet Computer (ICP) is its massive potential to disrupt the current internet infrastructure. By offering a platform where developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) that operate at web speed, Internet Computer (ICP) is positioned as a leader in the Web 3.0 revolution. With nearly 124 million tokens in circulation and a total supply exceeding 469 million, the demand for ICP is expected to grow as more developers and users migrate to its platform. Furthermore, ICP’s ability to enable the creation of open internet services with tokenized governance models offers a unique value proposition that appeals to both developers and investors. As the adoption of decentralized applications and services continues to rise, so too does the potential for Internet Computer (ICP) to achieve significant market dominance. Render (RNDR): Revolutionizing GPU Rendering Render (RNDR) is another cryptocurrency that has captured the interest of crypto whales, particularly those in the digital content creation industry. Render (RNDR) offers a decentralized GPU rendering network that allows digital artists to leverage idle GPU power for rendering tasks. This decentralized model not only reduces costs for creators but also maximizes the use of existing computational resources, making it a win-win for both GPU owners and content creators. The increasing demand for high-quality graphics in industries such as gaming, film, and virtual reality has positioned Render (RNDR) as a crucial player in the digital content ecosystem. By providing an efficient and scalable solution for GPU rendering, RNDR is addressing a critical need in the market, which is why it has become a favorite among crypto whales. Moreover, Render (RNDR) is gaining traction as more digital artists and content creators adopt its platform, leading to increased demand for its tokens. As the platform continues to grow and attract more users, the value of Render (RNDR) is expected to rise, making it an attractive investment for those looking to capitalize on the expanding digital content market. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Next Big Meme Coin While Internet Computer (ICP) and Render (RNDR) offer strong utility in their respective fields, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out its niche in the ever-popular meme coin sector. Meme coins have a history of delivering exponential returns in short periods, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself to be the next breakout star in this space. Priced at just $0.001777 during its ICO, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly gained traction among crypto enthusiasts looking for the next Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from other meme coins is its strategic approach to community engagement and viral marketing. The project has leveraged social media platforms and influencer partnerships to build a strong and growing community, which is essential for the success of any meme coin. Crypto whales are taking note of Mpeppe (MPEPE) not just because of its low entry price but also due to its potential for rapid appreciation. The project’s ability to create buzz and attract a dedicated following is reminiscent of other successful meme coins, making it a compelling investment for those looking to ride the next wave of meme coin mania. Why These Three Tokens Are Attracting Crypto Whales Crypto whales are known for their strategic investments, and their recent focus on Internet Computer (ICP), Render (RNDR), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is no coincidence. Each of these tokens offers unique value propositions that cater to different aspects of the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. Internet Computer (ICP) is poised to become the backbone of Web 3.0, offering a decentralized alternative to the traditional internet infrastructure. Render (RNDR) is revolutionizing the digital content creation industry by providing a decentralized GPU rendering network that maximizes computational resources. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is tapping into the viral power of meme coins, with a strategic approach to community building and marketing that has the potential to deliver significant returns. For investors, diversifying their portfolios with these three tokens offers exposure to different sectors within the cryptocurrency market, from decentralized infrastructure and digital content creation to the high-risk, high-reward world of meme coins. Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on the Future As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the importance of strategic investments cannot be overstated. Crypto whales, with their substantial capital and market influence, are setting their sights on Internet Computer (ICP), Render (RNDR), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) as the next big opportunities. By investing in these tokens, they are positioning themselves to capitalize on the growth potential of Web 3.0, the digital content economy, and the ever-evolving meme coin landscape. For retail investors, following the lead of these crypto whales could be a smart move. With Internet Computer (ICP) driving the future of decentralized internet, Render (RNDR) transforming digital content creation, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) poised to be the next meme coin sensation, these three cryptocurrencies offer a diversified and potentially lucrative investment strategy in the fast-paced world of digital assets.

32728318,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637318,1724349717,Playdoge and Mpeppe: Crypto Millionaire Pledges To Invest $1m Between Both Presales,"Recently, a crypto millionaire has made headlines by pledging $1 million to be split between two highly anticipated presales: Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). These two projects are attracting significant attention from investors, and this substantial commitment further underscores their potential. Let’s explore why Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are emerging as top picks for crypto enthusiasts. Playdoge (PLAY): A Crypto Player To Consider Playdoge (PLAY) is captivating the crypto community by combining the beloved Doge meme with the nostalgic charm of the 90s hit game, Tamagotchi. This mobile Play-to-Earn (P2E) game allows players to care for their digital Doge companion, earning $PLAY tokens as rewards for keeping the pet healthy and completing game levels. The game’s nostalgic appeal, combined with its modern blockchain-based rewards system, has drawn in a large following, particularly among those who grew up in the 90s. The Playdoge (PLAY) presale, which began on May 28, 2024, is now in its final stretch, set to conclude on August 26, 2024, at 10 AM UTC. The presale has already raised over $6.1 million, with just $500,000 more needed to reach its target. This rapid fundraising indicates strong investor confidence in the project. The current price of $PLAY is $0.00531, and with the presale ending soon, the token’s price could see a significant increase once it launches on decentralized exchanges. What makes Playdoge (PLAY) particularly appealing is its innovative integration of the Doge meme with a P2E gaming model. Players are incentivized to take care of their virtual pets by earning $PLAY tokens, which can be used for in-game rewards or traded on exchanges post-launch. The success of the Playdoge game will directly influence the value of $PLAY, making it a high-stakes, high-reward investment for those getting in early. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Next Meme Coin Sensation While Playdoge (PLAY) taps into nostalgia and gaming, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out its niche as the next big meme coin with a focus on community-driven growth and potential real-world utility. Priced at just $0.001777 during its presale, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a low entry point with the potential for significant returns, especially as the token gains traction. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly gained popularity due to its clever branding and the community engagement it fosters. The token is designed to appeal to the meme-loving crypto crowd, but it’s more than just a joke, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is building a strong foundation for long-term growth. With a rapidly growing community and strategic marketing efforts, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to follow in the footsteps of other successful meme coins, potentially delivering massive returns for early investors. The project’s focus on creating a strong, engaged community is one of its biggest strengths. Just as with Playdoge (PLAY), the success of Mpeppe (MPEPE) will depend heavily on its ability to maintain and grow its community base. Early investors, including the aforementioned crypto millionaire, are betting that Mpeppe (MPEPE) has what it takes to become the next breakout star in the meme coin space. Why the Millionaire’s Bet Matters The decision by a crypto millionaire to invest $1 million between Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a strong vote of confidence in both projects. Such large investments from seasoned investors often signal that a project has serious potential. By splitting the investment between these two presales, the investor is hedging against risk while maximizing potential returns, a strategy that could pay off significantly as both tokens gain market traction. This move also highlights the growing trend of diversification within the crypto space. Rather than putting all their eggs in one basket, savvy investors are spreading their bets across multiple promising projects, each with its own unique value proposition. In this case, Playdoge (PLAY) offers a nostalgic gaming experience with a modern twist, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an opportunity to get in early on the next big meme coin. The Road Ahead: What to Expect As the presales for Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) near their conclusion, all eyes are on how these projects will perform once they hit the open market. Both tokens are positioned to capitalize on strong community engagement and innovative use cases, making them exciting prospects for investors looking to multiply their portfolios. For Playdoge (PLAY), the key to success will be the adoption and popularity of its P2E game, which could drive demand for $PLAY tokens. For Mpeppe (MPEPE), the focus will be on building and sustaining a vibrant community that can push the token into the mainstream. If these projects can deliver on their promises, the $1 million investment could easily turn into a much larger sum, reinforcing the notion that early entry into promising crypto projects can lead to extraordinary gains. Conclusion: A High-Stakes Investment with High Reward Potential The crypto market is full of opportunities, but few are as compelling as the dual presales of Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). With a crypto millionaire now backing both projects, the stage is set for these tokens to make significant waves in the market. Whether you’re drawn to the nostalgic charm of Playdoge (PLAY) or the meme potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE), there’s no denying that both projects offer exciting opportunities for those looking to invest in the next big thing.

Both tokens are currently making waves in the market, with predictions that they could see a 100x increase in the coming months. But what makes these two coins so special? Let’s dive into why these projects are set to explode and why savvy investors are paying close attention. Base Dawgz (DAWGZ): Revolutionizing Meme Coins with Multi-Chain Functionality Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is setting a new standard for meme coins by incorporating a Multi-Chain functionality that allows it to operate across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and the Binance Smart Chain. This is a significant departure from traditional meme coins, which are typically confined to a single blockchain. By offering decentralized usage without limitations, Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) gives investors the flexibility to trade on the network that best suits their needs, making it a standout in the crowded meme coin market. Moreover, Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) has leveraged its innovative approach to build a strong and active community. With almost 15,000 followers on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram, the project has already raised close to $3 million in its presale phase. This community engagement is further amplified by the “Be Social for Airdrops” initiative, which rewards community members for their social media activity with $DAWGZ tokens. This not only incentivizes engagement but also helps in organically growing the community and spreading the word about the token. Another compelling feature is the staking program that Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) offers, which currently boasts an impressive APY of 814%. Early investors are particularly drawn to this, as it provides a lucrative way to earn returns on their holdings even before the token is listed on major exchanges. The project’s roadmap and whitepaper further detail plans for future development, including potential CEX listings, which could drive the token’s value even higher. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Next Big Meme Coin with Strategic Advantages While Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is making waves with its multi-chain capabilities, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a serious contender in the meme coin space with its unique blend of humor and utility. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a meme coin; it’s a movement. The token is currently priced at an enticing $0.001777, making it an attractive entry point for investors looking for significant upside potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly gained traction due to its innovative approach to community engagement and its plans to integrate with the gaming industry, a sector that is ripe for disruption by blockchain technology. The token’s presale has already attracted a substantial amount of investment, indicating strong market confidence in its potential. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its strategic positioning. While many meme coins rely solely on viral marketing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is building a sustainable ecosystem around its token, with plans for utility in decentralized applications (dApps) and gaming platforms. This utility, combined with its meme appeal, positions Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a token that could see exponential growth in the near future. Why These Tokens Are Poised to Explode The potential for both Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) to 100x in the coming months is not just speculative hype, it’s grounded in the strategic advantages that both tokens offer. Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is revolutionizing the meme coin space with its multi-chain functionality and strong community incentives, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out a niche in the gaming sector with its plans for integration into decentralized platforms. Investors are particularly excited about the early entry points for both tokens. Base Dawgz (DAWGZ), with its strong community and staking rewards, and Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its low initial price and growth potential, offer the kind of opportunities that savvy investors dream of. The fact that these tokens are still in their presale stages means that the most significant gains are likely still to come. Conclusion: The Future Looks Bright for Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, tokens like Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are not just surviving—they are thriving. With innovative features, strong community support, and strategic positioning in high-growth sectors, these tokens are set to become major players in the crypto space. Analysts are confident that both Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have the potential to 100x in the coming months, making them must-watch tokens for any serious investor. As these projects continue to develop, the only question left is: will you be part of the ride?

Q2 results show $35.6 million revenue, $21.7 million gross profit, and $10.9 million net loss. Professional asset managers like Stanley Druckenmiller are showing interest in TeraWulf, but valuation and seasonality risks should be considered. It's been a few months since my last piece covering TeraWulf ( WULF ) for Seeking Alpha. TeraWulf is a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining company with a slightly different approach than most peers; it's one of just a few miners that maintain a 'no-HODL' treasury strategy and I believe it's the only one utilizing nuclear power for a portion of its electricity source. This is a name that I've been in and out of a handful of times personally. To briefly summarize my thinking on WULF, here's an excerpt from the closing section of my previous article: Given the combination of efficiency and EH/s, I still think WULF is a buyout target at the right price. However, at current valuation levels, we may need to see WULF shares back under $2 before a peer with enough capital to do a deal would be interested. We currently find a stock price more than double that $2 per share figure I laid out in May. WULF Daily Chart (TrendSpider) Frankly, I've missed out on the larger part of this run since mid-June. In this update, we'll look at the company's Q2 results, interesting developments in hedge fund holdings, and risks to consider before longing the stock. Q2 Results Data by YCharts In the second quarter 2024, TeraWulf reported $35.6 million in revenue versus $13.9 million in cost of revenue for a gross profit of $21.7 million in the quarter. $ in millions Q2-23 Q1-24 Q2-24 YoY QoQ Revenue $15.5 $42.4 $35.6 129.7% -16.0% COGS $5.1 $14.4 $13.9 172.5% -3.5% Gross Profit $10.3 $28.0 $21.7 110.7% -22.5% Source: TeraWulf, Author's calculations When we look at the raw figures in the table above, we can see the ""halving"" impact reflected quite clearly. From both year over year and sequential standpoints, the margin is deteriorating. From Q2-23 to Q2-24, COGS rose faster than revenue. Furthermore, COGS fell slower than revenue sequentially from last quarter. Again, this shows the clear issue with mining Bitcoin as a long-term business. Data by YCharts From my vantage, TeraWulf has done an admirable job of keeping SG&A expense growth down relative to COGS - year over year SG&A rose 40.2% from $9.7 million to $13.6 million. Still, TeraWulf reported negative net income of $10.9 million in the quarter. Unlike other mining peers who have Bitcoin 'HODL' approaches to corporate treasury, there is no meaningful BTC stack that is revalued quarter to quarter due to FASB accounting rules. Data by YCharts At the end of June, TeraWulf had $104.1 million in cash and equivalents. This was due to a 15% increase in shares outstanding after the company tapped its ATM following the impressive price rune in the stock. Subsequent to the quarter ended June, TeraWulf paid down its remaining debt outstanding in a $77.5 million final payment. Per the conference call, the company is now holding $28.4 million in cash and Bitcoin following that large debt payment. August Investor Deck, Slide 4 (TeraWulf) The company is still guiding for considerable growth in EH/s over the next year even with HPC/AI services seemingly becoming a more important focus for the company longer term. Druckenmiller Is In Earnings and capacity growth plans aside, for me, the most interesting new development for WULF shareholders since I last covered the stock is the company appears to be quickly becoming a favorite with professional asset managers. According to data from Whale Wisdom, WULF is now owned by 198 total funds. That's double what fund holders were this time last year and nearly 4x the level from Q4-22: WULF (Whale Wisdom) The one that really stands out to me is Duquesne Family Office. This is the fund run by legendary money manager Stanley Druckenmiller. In the company's latest filings , Duquesne significantly trimmed Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Apple ( AAPL ) but bought a new 2.1 million share position in WULF. It's admittedly a very small position for Druck's fund at just 0.3% of AUM, but given the firm's track record, I think it's an interesting piece of information. Duquesne Family Office QoQ Performance (Whale Wisdom) At 39.8%, Duquesne has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four quarters and as far as I can tell, WULF is the only Bitcoin mining stock that the company currently has exposure to. Duquesne NVDA Transactions (Stockcircle) Previously, Duquesne played NVIDIA ( NVDA ) borderline perfectly after amassing 10 million shares at an average buy price of under $20 per share post-split and selling most of the position several times higher than cost basis. The point is, Duquesne is a fund that I think investors should be paying attention to and the recent interest in WULF is quite intriguing. However, that doesn't mean one needs to indiscriminately buy the stock at these levels. Risks: Valuation & Seasonality In May, WULF was trading at a little over 3x book value, which even then was ahead of most peers. In the chart below, I've added forward price to sales and two different mining peers for a valuation comparison. Marathon Digital ( MARA ) is the largest miner by both EH/s and by HODL stack. And Iris Energy ( IREN ) is a really strong comp because it shares TeraWulf's no-HODL approach, has a similar market cap, and mined almost the same amount of BTC in July as TeraWulf. Data by YCharts In each metric, WULF trades at significant premiums to both of these peers. At 12x forward sales, WULF trades at more than a 5x premium to IREN - which as I noted is a similar company by several key metrics. And at a P/B ratio of just under 5, IREN commands a book valuation more than double industry average. WULF Seasonality (TrendSpider) It's perhaps a sample size that is too small given TeraWulf only has two Septembers of trading post-IKONICS Corporation combination in late 2021, but in its current form WULF has never had a positive return in the month of September. In fact, September is historically WULF's worst month of the year, with a mean change of -27.6%. This aligns with general seasonality weakness in the broader equity market. It certainly doesn't mean the same has to happen again, but given the recent runup in the stock price, I think it's wise to be mindful of possible seasonal weakness over the next couple of months. Closing Thoughts WULF is certainly still a name that I'm interested in. I will reiterate that I think Bitcoin mining is a flawed business longer term, but there could ultimately be investable opportunities if a few of these companies can grow HPC segments. Stanley Druckenmiller's team seems to like what they see in TeraWulf and that does actually matter to me. Especially considering Druck's recent performance with NVDA. This is purely speculative on my part, but I suspect Duquesne is looking for AI opportunities beyond chipmakers, and WULF seems to be one that has interested the fund. I still have some concerns about valuation and broad market seasonality that, I think, will weight on the stock from here temporarily. I'm going to keep it a ""hold"" for now, but it's very much on watch.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4716509-terawulf-q2-24-dont-fade-druck?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32726813.jpeg

32726654,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637131,1724346027,"Optimism (OP) Bulls Sets Sights On $1.8, Is the Downtrend Doomed?","Optimism current price action has caught the market’s attention as bullish momentum builds, driving the price toward the pivotal $1.8 level. This upward drive could mark a potential turning point, challenging the prevailing downtrend that has kept the bulls in check for weeks. As buyers regain control, speculations are, is the once-dominant bearish trend on the verge of collapse, or will resistance at $1.8 hold firm? This analysis explores the recent positive momentum propelling Optimism toward the crucial $1.8 resistance level and assesses whether this push can halt the ongoing downtrend. It will also provide insights into potential outcomes and conclude with an outlook on whether the bulls can maintain their strength or if the bears are poised to regain control by examining technical indicators and key price levels. In the last 24 hours, OP has gained a 5.32% increase, reaching approximately $1.44. The crypto asset market capitalization has surpassed $1.7 billion, with trading volume exceeding $135 million. Over this period, the market cap has increased by 5.40%, while trading volume has surged by 11.78%. Assessing Optimism’s Bullish Momentum Toward Key $1.8 Resistance Optimism’s price is currently bullish, trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart. If the bulls sustain their strength above this key indicator, it could drive the cryptocurrency toward further gains, aiming for the $1.8 resistance level. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that Optimism could continue its surge toward the $1.8 resistance level. The signal line has risen above 50% and is trending around 69%, suggesting that upbeat pressure remains strong in the market. On the daily chart, OP’s price is demonstrating stability following a successful rejection at the $1.4 mark. This steadiness suggests that the bullish momentum may persist, potentially enabling the price to rise further toward the $1.8 resistance level and the 100-day SMA. If the bulls continue to exert their influence, it could set the stage for more gains and reinforce the upward trend. Finally, the 1-day RSI indicates that bullish momentum for Optimism is building up, with the signal line currently around 50.81% after surpassing the 50% mark, indicating a potential for additional upward movement for the asset. Momentum And Market Moves: What’s Next For Optimism As It Eyes $1.8? Should the current propitious pressure continue and drive OP’s price above the $1.8 level, it could signal the beginning of a bullish rally. The breakout might propel the asset toward the next resistance at $3 and potentially higher levels. However, if Optimism rebounds from the $1.8 level, it might retrace to its previous low of $1. A break below this level could indicate further downside momentum, potentially leading the cryptocurrency toward the $0.4 range and other lower levels.

The drop in the overall crypto market cap has impacted Coinbase's average daily volumes by 27.56% compared to the previous quarter after they reported a decline in user engagement and trading activity on the platform. In Q2, the exchange's market share slid to 41.2% from 44.6% in Q1 after heightened competition (from companies like Robinhood Markets, Inc. ( HOOD ) which I also happen to be bullish on ) and thus user migration to other platforms. The crypto market's recent bearish tilt is a function of Vice President (and candidate for president) Kamala Harris' strong showing in polls showing she has a real chance of becoming president (much higher than Biden did a month ago). Critics fear she will adopt policies that are even less favorable to the cryptocurrency sector than the Biden administration. What's notable about this is that she has been far less outspoken on the issue compared to her opponent, Donald Trump, who has been a vocal supporter of the crypto industry​. I think that the concerns about Harris' potential presidency devastating to the cryptocurrency market appear overblown. In the past, the U.S. stock market has demonstrated growth across both Democratic and Republican administrations. The cryptocurrency market has done the same. And I expect that going forward, the cryptocurrency market will likely exhibit a similar trend. Under President Biden (specifically SEC Chairman Gary Gensler), the market has definitely been affected by the increasing regulatory scrutiny, but that doesn't mean it has collapsed. Similarly, I think this means that a Harris administration would not be the grenade into the crypto machine like many fear it would. The U.S. financial system (and I think the Defi market as well with most coins being decentralized) tends to find an equilibrium regardless of the political chaos, as the investors who participate in crypto are now spread across different income levels and global markets. It's really one of the most global financial markets we have. Do we really think one country's leader is going to stop all that? On top of this, I think Congress is actually moving in the opposite direction, with legislation on the docket to help safeguard crypto as a legitimate asset class. I believe these legislative developments will further help provide favorable legal frameworks to the world of crypto. In essence, I think all of this political bearishness is overblown. I'm still bullish on Coinbase. I believe they will benefit from the still strong (and YoY growing) investor confidence in crypto that will outlast short-term political concerns​. Why I'm Doing Follow-Up Coverage As I mentioned before, Coinbase has dropped 5% since my last coverage update, but I think the story is the same meaning this fall is largely noise. The crypto exchange faced lower trading volumes in Q2 amid heightened competition from platforms like Robinhood. I think a lot of the crypto market's reaction has been influenced by political developments with the odds of Trump winning the presidential election now lower . The sudden shift in political expectations after President Joe Biden's decision to back out has raised a lot of concern among crypto investors. They fear that without Trump's support for less crypto regulation, Harris might likely impose stricter regulations that curb the rapid expansion of the market​. With this (and the betting odds) I think a lot of this perceived risk is now overpriced in the market. Despite these concerns, I really think the long-term fundamentals remain strong. There's increasing institutional adoption through Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs plus broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as more legitimate investment vehicles. I'm doing follow-up coverage to show the market is too bearish and too irrational here about the political effects on crypto. When the market is irrational and when the market is too bearish, that's when I think investors have the best chance to make a strong return. Quarter Shows They're Resilient Even With Sell-Offs To understand where Coinbase is at right now, we have to look at the market's overall mood (including specifically Bitcoin). Germany and now the United States have both recently sold off (or are selling off) large amounts of Bitcoin, which has really contributed to the ongoing volatility in the cryptocurrency market. The German government liquidated approximately $175 million in Bitcoin, while the U.S. government has followed suit. In all, the two governments have sent a combined $738 million from their wallets to the exchanges in order to sell off the proceeds. I think this is a terrible idea (but that's a different discussion). As a U.S. citizen, it's really disappointing to see the government divesting from Bitcoin, especially given the long-term potential of the asset. Despite the short-term negative impact of these sell-offs, I still think that they cannot strongly alter the long-term path of Bitcoin, the path of crypto as a whole, or the tailwinds this will provide Coinbase. While these are probably an important factor in keeping Bitcoin's price range-bound this summer, they won't last forever. Coinbase's Q2 earnings reveal still strong performance with total revenue of $1.45 billion, up 104.8% YoY . However, while they recorded a modest net income of just $36 million, I think it's important the exchange continued to be profitable even in a challenging crypto market. What's also key is that the quarter's results also show Coinbase's efforts to diversify revenue streams through the growth of their subscription and services revenue, which surged 17% quarter-over-quarter to $599 million​. The company used to rely mainly on transaction fees, which declined by 27% due to lower trading volumes​. Compared to previous market cycles, Coinbase's revenue stability has already improved which, I think, is big here. Their emphasis on building out subscription-based revenue lines through products like blockchain rewards and custodial services has improved their income stream. The 300% quarter-over-quarter growth in transactions on Base, Coinbase's Layer 2 solution, is further proof of this. During the company's August 13 conference , CFO Alesia Haas emphasized that the company has committed to maintaining positive adjusted EBITDA in all market conditions, regardless of the volatility in the cryptocurrency market: Starting in January of 2023, with our first quarter earnings call, we made a commitment that we would generate positive adjusted EBITDA in all market conditions, and that we would not subject the market to the volatility of crypto, that we would neutralize that through our expense management and the discipline of our execution. And we've now largely delivered on that goal. We've delivered positive adjusted EBITDA for six straight quarters through various crypto asset volatility and crypto market price conditions. And that success has been due to our focus on expenses and making sure we're really prudent in managing our fixed expenses and also due to our focus on increasing revenue diversification. So in Q2, you've noticed that our subscription and services revenue reached almost $600 million of total revenue in the quarter. That was the all-time high of this total combined revenue. And that provides some insulation from crypto asset price and volatility, which drives variability in our transaction revenues. We believe both of these can grow over time, but that diversification of revenue that comes from different drivers is helping us build this all-weather company. During their Q2 earnings call , Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong stated that their business model has become far more stable and less reliant on the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets than in the past. He announced: Q2 was another strong quarter, and it was our sixth consecutive quarter of a positive adjusted EBITDA. Subscription and services revenue reached an all-time high with transaction revenue declining versus Q1. Coinbase is now an all-weather company with increasingly diversified revenue streams and I'm proud of our discipline managing expenses. In closing, Q2 was another great quarter across the board. Whether the market is up or down, we're driving the industry forward, building more predictable revenue streams, and creating long-term shareholder value -Q2 Call. What I am trying to get at with these results is that Coinbase is far more stable than it used to be from an operational standpoint. This not only helps with crypto market volatility, but it also means that if any particular part of their business model comes under threat, they have a diversified business to help offset this. Company Is Well Positioned In a Harris Administration In Congress, outgoing Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Representative Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) have both expressed their strong support for advancing cryptocurrency legislation. Stabenow, who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee, emphasized the importance of transferring more crypto regulatory authority to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which has been a key point of legal contention in Washington: who controls the regulation of crypto. Meanwhile, McHenry has been actively promoting the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which aims to improve the crypto regulatory framework. CFO Haas has mentioned this during the conference event earlier this month: I think it's so important that we acknowledge Senator Stabenow and Representative McHenry for their leadership. Both of them have exemplified leadership in support of crypto and bipartisan legislation, and we're very grateful to all of their initiatives. So as you saw FIT 21 pass the House, we saw overwhelmingly bipartisan majority support, and we would really like to see the Senate do the same. We are seeing good momentum and we're cautiously optimistic we'll continue to see this momentum through the fall. But as these things go they are difficult to predict. The proposed laws will offer clearer regulatory guidelines, which will reduce the legal uncertainties in the industry and encourage even greater institutional participation in the crypto market. With these, Coinbase can expect increased trading volumes and higher revenues in the future. Furthermore, with the CFTC likely to gain more regulatory authority, digital assets could be classified much better than they currently are under the SEC. To this point, industry defiance against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been growing. For instance, the Blockchain Association has sued the SEC over new rules that broaden the definition of what constitutes a ""dealer"" of securities. They argued that the SEC has overstepped their authority​. Ethereum's co-founder, Joe Lubin, has also described the SEC's actions as ""gaslighting."" Lubin is seeking to clarify the regulatory boundaries by arguing that the SEC is unjustly expanding their jurisdiction. While the SEC is attempting to assert control, their efforts may not be as effective as anticipated in curbing the activities of major crypto platforms. As these multi-prong efforts move forward, I think it'll lead to a more defined and potentially less restrictive regulatory environment that will allow platforms like Coinbase to operate with even greater stability. A more stable Coinbase should trade at a higher valuation in my opinion. Valuation Despite a spat of downward revisions in earnings estimates for Coinbase, the market still anticipates a strong financial performance going forward. The current forward revenue growth estimate is approximately 21.66%, which is significantly higher than the sector median of 5.33%​. In fact, to be specific, this is a 305.43% premium to the sector median. While Coinbase's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio feels high at 36.46 , standing at a premium of 220.07% over the sector median of 11.39, it's actually a lower premium than what we see with the revenue growth. Despite the surface high P/E ratio, I think the market is actually not overestimating Coinbase's potential based on revenue expectations. If Coinbase were to recover to a ~300% premium to the sector median based on revenue growth, this would give investors some significant upside and allow the market to fully price-in the growth expectations. At a roughly 300% premium, we could see an upside of around 36.32% for shares from here. Risks What's good is that crypto is being taken seriously in the US with several bills in Congress that seek to establish clearer regulations for the cryptocurrency industry. What's bad is that we are dependent on Congress to act. This will be inherently slow with absolutely zero guarantees. However, I actually remain optimistic. Recent developments by members of Congress while on the campaign trail suggest that the momentum for crypto-related legislation is still super strong. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has expressed a strong level of confidence that a crypto bill could pass the Senate by the end of the year, noting that the issue has garnered bipartisan support​. As I mentioned above, industry insiders have speculated that Harris could be less bullish on crypto than the current Biden administration. Her ties to regulatory and financial figures who are skeptical of the industry have given them pause on the future of crypto in the US. I really think this is misguided. I think the current bipartisan nature of the legislative efforts will counterbalance these concerns. Both the Democrats and Republicans are now increasingly recognizing the importance of establishing a legal framework for digital assets. Any legislation passed is likely to have a strong foundation of support, in my opinion. On this same note, I've also noticed Coinbase is pushing for cryptocurrency to be a key election issue, particularly in swing states. The company is working to ensure that any future administration, including a potential Harris presidency, will continue to support the industry. Coinbase understands that political winds change, but they know this industry will come out ahead and navigate it in a favorable manner. I remain really optimistic. Bottom Line While Coinbase's shares have declined slightly since late June due to the downturn in crypto, I think the story remains intact, no matter who is in the White House. The business is more durable than it appears. Strong bipartisan support in Congress for advancing cryptocurrency legislation is helping hedge the presidential race, and it makes me feel good about the future. I still believe that Coinbase remains a strong buy. Buying crypto will soon be seen as something you do regardless of who is President. At this point, I think the bull market will accelerate. Buying and holding almost always tends to be the superior strategy. I think that's the same here.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4716485-coinbase-great-stock-no-matter-whos-president?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32725518.jpeg

32725354,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637295,1724343285,"Bitcoin Could Target $63,000 But Must First Clear This Vital Resistance Level","After experiencing a significant 25% pullback earlier this month, plunging to the $49,000 level, the king of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), has managed to consolidate above the crucial $60,000 support for the last 24 hours. However, Bitcoin’s journey toward further price appreciation has been without obstacles. The digital asset has been unable to surpass higher resistance levels, which technical analysts deem essential for a retest of the all-time high levels reached in March. What On-Chain Metrics Reveal According to a recent analysis shared on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), technical analyst Inspo Crypto has highlighted the cautious sentiment among options traders. While they remain bullish, they continue to hedge against potential downside risks, suggesting an expectation of a potential market shakeout or negative news. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price (DOGE) Poised To Surge If This Support Holds The analyst also contends that the selling pressure on the upside has been robust. Wednesday’s price push-up primarily triggered sell orders, leading to the liquidation of high-leverage long positions. Delving deeper into the market data, the options market reflects a mixed outlook with slight bullish tendencies, but the 25-Delta Skew indicates uncertainty, particularly with upcoming economic events influencing trader caution. In the futures market, the data shows short-term bullish momentum but with increased volatility. The rising open interest suggests more market participation, yet the liquidation heatmap highlights the risks of sudden price swings. Bitcoin Breakout To $63,000 Or Consolidation At $60,000? Turning to the spot market and technical analysis, the data paints a picture of bullish momentum, but the cryptocurrency faces strong resistance at the $61,300 to $61,500 levels. The volume, however, appears insufficient to facilitate a significant breakout, and the order book data reveals substantial sell-side pressure at these levels. Inspo Crypto further found that the average trader sentiment is neutral to slightly bullish, with a rating of 5.5 out of 10. Traders are cautiously optimistic, but there are clear signs of uncertainty and potential volatility. Related Reading: Solana Dump Far From Over? Whales Continue To Dump SOL The price forecast for the next 24 hours suggests that Bitcoin may continue attempting to break the $61,300 to $61,500 resistance level. However, a genuine breakout seems unlikely without a substantial increase in trading volume. If the resistance holds, a pullback toward the $60,000 or even the $59,500 level is possible. For the rest of the week, if Bitcoin manages to break through the $61,500 level with increasing volume, a move toward the $62,500 to $63,000 range could follow. Otherwise, consolidation between $59,500 and $61,000 is likely, especially if market volume remains low and selling pressure persists. Late Wednesday, BTC climbed above $61,7000 for the first time in nearly two weeks but has since fallen back to the $60,000 level. Still, the Bitcoin price is up 1.8% over the past 24 hours.

According to CoinGecko, the token is up nearly 12% since last week despite the market dipping slightly yesterday, August 21st. Related Reading: Celestia: Market Dip Leaves TIA Investors 16% In The Red Uniswap’s position within the crypto community is largely untouched, especially after its recent on-chain development that shows exceptional growth as a market. However, there are some aspects where the platform is seeing some weakness, putting UNI’s position into question in the long term. Uniswap Sees Exponential Increase In Uniswap v2 Trading Pairs In a recent X post, Uniswap shared a Dune query made by Austin Adams, a research fellow on the platform. It revealed that ever since Uniswap v2 was launched on the platform’s major partner blockchains, trading pairs on the latter have skyrocketed by a significant degree. Weekly number of pools being created on Uniswap v2 Optimism: 342 Arbitrum: 1,866 Polygon: 2,989 Ethereum: 118,820 …and Base: 512,545 🔵 pic.twitter.com/VkBPaY4qMq — Uniswap Labs 🦄 (@Uniswap) August 19, 2024 From its initial figure of 79,277 back in February, it soared to over 636,562 as of August 19th; a whopping 703% increase since it was first deployed. The largest share of the bunch was Base, CoinBase’s in-house Ethereum layer-2, with over 512,545 pairs alone on its Uniswap v2 deployment. The trust built within this period between Uniswap and a major market player like CoinBase will help the ecosystem in the long term. However, criticisms arose as to how the data was translated and what it represented. this is a bit odd / surprising — seems like an extreme long-tail distribution of liquidity that results in many pools being insufficient am i thinking about this correctly? — brady 🌴 (@bmgentile) August 19, 2024 CEO of Bonzo Finance Labs, Brady Gentile, stated that the data was odd and surprising for him, leading to the conclusion that the data represents that a lot of the pools included in the 636,562 figure don’t have sufficient liquidity, thus finding the need for multiple liquidity pools for the same pair. The sentiment has been echoed by the majority of the comments on the post. This air of suspicion with how the data is shown and with little to no chance of it being addressed by Uniswap may affect the overall view of the platform. Breakthrough On $6.8 In The Short Term With the slight drama surrounding how data was represented on the platform, the broader sentiment flipped from bullish to bearish as the bears tackled the breakthrough on the $6.8 ceiling. Related Reading: Tron Rises 24% Amid New Developments – Will The Uptrend Continue? With exchange reserves of the token reaching monthly highs, UNI bulls are exhausted and overburdened by strong market pressure in the short term which will inevitably lead to losses. UNI may retrace to $5.8 in the short term before stabilizing on the $5.8-$6.8 in the medium term before another attempt in the long term. However, this can only happen if the market itself is bullish, but with the recent up-and-down swings it has been experiencing, caution should be exercised to prevent further losses.

42417355,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYDHB,1724339984,OmegaPro Co-Founder Arrested in Turkey on Suspicion of $4B Ponzi Scheme: Reports,"Andreas Szakacs, a co-founder of OmegaPro, alleged to be a cryptocurrency-related scam, was arrested in Turkey in July, Turkish media reported.  Turkish authorities seized cold wallets and computers and tracked $160 million of cryptocurrency movements, the reports said.  Andreas Szakacs, a co-founder of OmegaPro, was arrested in Turkey in July for his involvement with the company alleged to have scammed investors of $4 billion in a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme, Turkish media reported Thursday.  Szakacs, a Swede, changed his name to Emre Avci after becoming a citizen of the country, Turkey Today said. He rejected the accusations and said he worked in finance and marketing, according to BirGün, an Istanbul-based daily.  The gendarmerie seized computers and 32 cold wallets, according to behindmlm.com. While Szakacs did not provide passwords for the devices, Turkish authorities were able to track $160 million of cryptocurrency movements, BirGün said.  OmegaPro reportedly collapsed in late 2022, around the time the FTX crypto empire crashed. Prior to that, countries including France, Belgium Spain and Argentina sent out regulatory fraud warnings about the company, behindmlm.com reported at the time. OmegaPro did not target U.S. customers, it said.  The arrest followed a June 28 tip-off from an anonymous informant.  A Dutch national, Abdul Ghaffar Mohaghegh, gave a statement to the gendarmerie saying he'd lost $7 million in the scheme and claimed to have power of attorney from 3,000 of the affected investors who had collectively lost $103 million.

42417367,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYDSX,1724338800,Crypto for Advisors: Are Crypto SMAs Right for Institutions?,"There’s no doubt crypto ETFs have made a splash since their U.S. debut earlier this year, with potentially record-breaking growth. In today’s issue, Leo Mindyuk, CEO of ML Tech, looks at the differences between investing in crypto via Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) and ETFs.  Then, CoinDesk Indices Kim Greenberg Klemballa answers questions about SMA ownership and adoption in ‘Ask an Expert.’  - Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  The Advantages of Actively Managed SMAs over Crypto ETFs for Institutional Investors  Crypto Goes Mainstream  Earlier this year, cryptocurrencies made a great leap toward mainstream adoption as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finally approved trading U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track spot bitcoin and ether.  This meant that, for the first time, investors could trade regulated Bitcoin and Ether spot-based instruments on regulated U.S. exchanges. More importantly, it meant that crypto had finally gained the imprimatur of securities regulators and was no longer considered some sort of rogue investment, bought and sold only by technology fanatics.  Crypto SMAs vs ETFs  As a result, millions of novice investors are getting their first taste of crypto by buying bitcoin and ether ETFs. But for more experienced institutional investors, are ETFs the best way to invest?  Separately Managed Accounts, or SMAs offer significant advantages over ETFs for institutional investors to invest in crypto via actively managed accounts.  SMAs’ Benefits Over Crypto ETFs  What Are SMAs?  Crypto SMAs are portfolios of digital assets managed on your behalf by a professional investment manager. This last part – “professional investment manager” – is particularly important with crypto. Crypto is still new, in some ways, crypto doesn't trade in the same ways as stock does. Plus, crypto “fundamentals” don’t refer to earnings and accounting metrics but rather to a whole set of new metrics related to usage, their issuing blockchain, individual activity (which can be seen) of huge holders, and so forth. If you’re investing in crypto, it pays to use an active investment manager who is experienced in crypto.  Direct Ownership: More Control & Tailored Risk Management  Unlike ETFs, SMAs give you direct ownership of your assets, which enables greater portfolio customization to meet your specific risk/return needs goals. That is, SMAs can be custom-tailored by your investment manager to meet your unique requirements – risk tolerance, investment horizon, financial goals and more. Direct ownership also facilitates more transparent and straightforward tax management strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting. Finally, SMAs are custody-agnostic, allowing investors to choose from a wide variety of custodians and venues ranging from Anchorage, BitGo, Coinbase and Kraken.  Diversification  Along with custom-tailoring, actively managed SMAs also enable diversification. If you own a BTC ETF, you track (more or less) the returns of BTC, period. With an actively managed SMA you have access to the entire universe of cryptos (248 cryptos currently listed on Coinbase and 200+ on Kraken) and can diversify your portfolio any way you like.  Additionally, active management allows you to change the allocations. While passive management may be great for some investments, it can lead to very steep losses for crypto. Cryptos often move fast, not a good dynamic for passive strategies.  Outperformance  Active management in SMAs can of course, potentially outperform an underlying coin or coin index. Experienced managers can leverage market analysis, trading strategies and timing to capitalize on market opportunities, which you don’t get with an ETF. And for those investors who are only interested in select coins, SMAs can provide the potential to overlay additional alpha (outperformance) on top of the coin exposure (beta).  24/7 Trading  ETFs trade during normal weekday market hours when the major exchanges are open. The crypto markets operate 24/7. This is a significant difference if you're not a crypto investor. The biggest, of course, is that it eliminates opening gap risk, which, if you’ve traded for any length of time, has probably bitten you at least once. Actively managed SMAs provide your manager the ability to ALWAYS swiftly react to market movements and adjust portfolios accordingly.  What is Right for You?  Crypto ETFs are proving to be very attractive to new crypto investors. Trends indicate, however, that institutions, high-net-worth individuals and registered investment advisors will likely gravitate towards actively managed SMAs over time. The personalized nature, flexibility, and potential for enhanced returns offered by SMAs make them an attractive option for sophisticated investors.  - Leo Mindyuk, CEO, ML Tech  Ask an Expert  Can I tailor a crypto SMA?  As mentioned above, the SMA structure allows for direct ownership of the underlying asset. This means you can tailor crypto SMAs. For example, if your client wants to allocate 50% of a portfolio to bitcoin and 50% to ether, an SMA could be created to obtain this exposure. Crypto SMAs give access to a wide array of assets, meaning you can get exposure to assets outside of bitcoin and ether as well. Multi-asset support provides a deeper level of exposure to crypto. You can potentially have a portfolio of the top 5, 10 or 20 crypto assets. This may enable further diversification and broader exposure to the crypto asset class.  What are the potential tax benefits of an SMA?  An SMA may allow an investor flexibility for tax-loss harvesting, portfolio customization to manage concentrated exposures, and potential tax-advantaged charitable gifting. For further reading on this topic, J.P. Morgan Private Bank has an informativearticle. This is not to be taken as tax advice. Always consult a tax professional.  How has the SMA market grown over the past few years?  A recent survey has shown that SMAs are gaining favor. Fewer advisors expect to increase their allocations to model portfolios in the year ahead, while advisors plan to increase allocations to SMAs. Through 2023, SMA assets under managementhave climbed to nearly $2.2 trillion.  - Kim Greenberg Klemballa, head of marketing, CoinDesk Indices  Apple will enable crypto payments via third-party applications in a new iPhone and its upcoming release.

32721584,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637108,1724335249,Solana Dump Far From Over? Whales Continue To Dump SOL,"The Solana dump looks far from over as whales continue offloading their SOL holdings during this market downtrend. The recent shakeup in the crypto space might have also contributed to these whales’ bearish sentiment towards Solana. Crypto Whale Offloads $16 Million Worth Of Solana In an X (formerly Twitter) post, the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain drew the crypto community’s attention to a whale who has sold 114,300 SOL ($16 million) on Binance and OKX since August 4. This whale’s most recent sale came on August 20, when they sold 10,000 SOL ($1.41 million). Related Reading: Ethereum Metrics Turn Positive: Can This Drive A New ATH Above $5,000? NewsBTC previously reported about a crypto whale that sold $86 million worth of Solana this year. This particular whale is also back in action, as on-chain data shows that they recently sold 20,000 SOL ($2.9 million). That brings this whale’s total Solana sale to 614,000 SOL ($89 million) since January 15. Although the reason for these recent sales remains unknown, they could be related to the bearish sentiment in the Solana ecosystem. With its once vibrant meme coin ecosystem being threatened by other networks like Tron and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume is declining, a metric that could ultimately affect its price. Data from DeFiLlama shows that Solana’s DEX volume has dropped by over 20% in the last seven days. Meanwhile, Tron and BSC’s trading volumes are up by over 436% and 15%, respectively. This development is already weighing on Solana, as SOL’s price has remained tepid. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Solana is one of the few cryptos in the top 20 crypto by market cap not to have recorded a gain in the last seven days. Another reason for the recent bearish outlook on Solana is reports that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had rejected the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s (CBOE) 19b-4 filings for the Spot Solana ETFs. The Commission is still said to be adamant that Solana is a security. Some Whales Remain Undeterred Despite the bearish outlook on Solana, some crypto whales remain undeterred and have seen this as an opportunity to accumulate more SOL. Two whales, in particular, recently invested millions of dollars in the crypto token—the first whale (9tuA8L) withdrew 30,000 SOL ($4.25 million from Binance and staked these tokens on August 21.

Powell's keynote speech at the Kansas City Fed's Jackson Hole Economic Symposium is scheduled for Friday at 10 am ET and past Fed chairs – including Powell – have often used this forum to tip off important shifts in central bank policy.  Latest News: Bitcoin Tops $61K Before Powell's Jackson Hole Speech as Ether ETFs Face Record Outflows  As often occurs, markets have been way ahead of the Fed, with traders weeks ago having priced in a 100% chance of at least a 25 basis point rate cut at the bank's September meeting. Yesterday's release of the FOMC minutes from the Fed's July policy meeting also likely took away some of tomorrow's thunder, saying the ""vast majority"" of participants saw a September rate cut as likely appropriate.  Beyond tipping the September cut, most anticipate Powell to flag a cautious approach to easing policy, i.e. signaling that the Fed will trim just 25 basis points at its September meeting and advising markets not to expect an unbroken series of rate cuts at future meetings.  Traditional markets on the rise as bitcoin languishes  Despite a sizable stumble from mid-July into early August, U.S. stock markets have mostly been in bull mode in the lead up to the coming easing cycle. The S&P 500 is only about 1% below its record high hit in early July and the Nasdaq a bit more than 4% below its peak. Gold has been on a run as well, touching a record high of $2,566 earlier this week.  Bond markets are in a good mood too, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield yesterday dropping to a multi-year low of 3.77%.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, however, has been unable to get out of its own way. Though recovering nicely from the early August panic that briefly took prices below $50,000, bitcoin at its current $60,800 is far below an all-time high of around $73,500 touched all the way back in March.  The world's largest crypto has seemingly been ignoring other positive catalysts as well, including growing institutional interest and continued inflows into the spot ETFs. Bitcoin this week also got potential good news on the regulatory front with ABC News reporting that crypto-friendly Robert Kennedy Jr. could drop out of the presidential race on Friday and endorse crypto-friendly GOP candidate Donald Trump.

There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.1050 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh increase above the $0.1080 resistance zone. Dogecoin Price Starts Fresh Increase In the past few sessions, Dogecoin price saw a decent increase from the $0.0950 zone like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price was able to clear the $0.100 and $0.1020 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed it above $0.1050 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. A high was formed at $0.1079 before there was a pullback. The price declined below the $0.1060 level. The price even declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1020 swing low to the $0.1079 high. However, the bulls are active near the $0.1040 level. They protected the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1020 swing low to the $0.1079 high. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.1050 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is again rising and trading above the $0.1050 level. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1072 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1080 level. A close above the $0.1080 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1120 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1200 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1350. More Downsides In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1080 level, it could start another downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1055 level. The next major support is near the $0.1035 level. The main support sits at $0.1020. If there is a downside break below the $0.1020 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.0950 level or even $0.0920 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.1035 and $0.1020.

42417361,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYDPR,1724332042,Memecoin Frenzy Reaches Tron as Justin Sun-Backed SunPump Rakes in Big Bucks,"SunPump has generated over $1 million in under two weeks by enabling users to create and trade meme coins easily. It has seen significant activity with over 7,300 tokens created in 24 hours, earning substantial revenue.  Early investors in meme coins like SUNWUKONG and SUNDOG have seen massive returns, with one trader turning $1,000 into $400,000.  The virality has led to record revenues for the underlying Tron network, which crossed $3.48 million in two days and positively influenced the price of TRX and related assets.  Merchants made fortunes by selling shovels during the gold rush, and the crypto market is seeing glimpses of that behavior in current times.  Newly-released SunPump.meme, a meme coin generator on the Tron network backed by Tron creator Justin Sun, has raked in over $1 million revenue in a little under two weeks. The application lets users easily issue meme coins and trade them as they would on a crypto exchange. The product banks on the ongoing meme coin craze among crypto traders, one that is mainly focused within the Solana ecosystem.  SunPump is similar in concept to Solana’s runaway hit application Pump.Fun. Both allow users to select a picture, choose the number of tokens, a theme, and issue new tokens for a few dollars in capital.  These tokens are automatically listed on decentralized exchanges once they reach a market value of $60,000 on Pump and $69,420 (a reference to memes) on SunPump.  SunPump is quickly gaining a following. Data tracked by Dune Analytics shows over 7,300 tokens were created on SunPump in the past 24 hours, generating $585,000 revenue. On the other hand, Pump recorded 6,700 new token issuances, generating $366,000 in revenue in that timeframe.  Several meme coins launched on SunPump have created big paper profits for early buyers.  One address “TDm2” tracked by on-chain analytics tool Arkham shows its owner turned an initial $1,000 purchase into $400,000 on SUNWUKONG, a reference to the newly-release Chinese video game Black Myth: Wukong.  Another trader turned $1,690 of SUNDOG into more than $20 million million in six days. They hold $19.5 million of SUNDOG across seven addresses and have already sent $1 million to exchanges, Arkham noted.  The platform’s popularity is driven, in part, by Sun’s bullish posts about the future of SunPump.  “It's just the beginning,” he said in a Thursday X post. “We are doing our best to serve all the meme developers and users in the industry.”  “It's still early. Just do the math,” Sun said on Wednesday. “How big of a market can be created with over $60 billion in liquidity? The total market cap of TRON meme is still less than $200 million USD. TO THE SUN.”  On Thursday, SunPump's transaction fees were reduced to a flat fee of 0.76 TRX—worth 1 cent—from an earlier fee of 1% per transaction to encourage more usage.  As such, SunPump’s popularity has boosted the fortunes of its underlying network and TRX tokens. Data tracked by DefiLlama shows Tron made a lifetime record $3.48 million in revenue in the past two days each. This was the first time the network made more than $2 million in a single day since it was first launched in May 2018.  TRX prices, meanwhile, have jumped more than 20% in the past week, beating bitcoin and major token gains tracked by the liquid CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, which are just over 4%.  Other Tron-based assets closely related to founder Justin Sun, such as BTT, SUN and JST have rocketed higher as well, rising as much as 15% over the past week, CoinGecko data shows.  Such gains are just beginning. Sun said Thursday that the “meme strategy” could bring the Tron blockchain revenue to over $4 billion in the next 12 months, which could mean at least $2 billion given as rewards to stakers and for transaction subsidies – boosting the fundamentals for TRX tokens.",POSITIVE,TRX,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TRX | ARKM,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/22/memecoin-frenzy-reaches-tron-as-justin-sun-backed-sunpump-rakes-in-big-bucks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b2530b5d6c9fb6936fe211f0db3a192d4bc2c48-1500x833.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32719890,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637244,1724331649,Ethereum (ETH) And Mpeppe Two Cryptocurrency That Will Keep Making You Money,"Savvy investors are always on the lookout for assets that promise not just potential gains but consistent returns over time.

Now, a new contender, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is joining the ranks, offering innovative features that have captivated the crypto community. Together, Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) represent two cryptocurrencies that are well-positioned to keep making you money. Here’s why these two assets are becoming essential components of a successful investment strategy. Ethereum (ETH): The Powerhouse Driving Decentralized Finance Ethereum (ETH) has solidified its position as one of the most critical and valuable cryptocurrencies on the market. As the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts, Ethereum (ETH) has become the foundation for countless decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This versatility has made ETH a must-have asset for investors looking to capitalize on the ongoing innovation within the blockchain space. Ethereum (ETH)’s dominance in the smart contract arena ensures a steady demand for ETH, as it is essential for paying transaction fees (gas) on the network. The explosive growth of DeFi, largely built on the Ethereum (ETH) platform, further drives this demand, as more users engage in lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries. Upcoming upgrades, particularly the transition to Ethereum (ETH) 2.0, promise to improve the network’s scalability, security, and energy efficiency. These enhancements are expected to attract even more users and developers, further boosting ETH’s value. With these strengths, Ethereum (ETH) remains a reliable choice for investors seeking long-term growth. Its established infrastructure and continuous development make it a cryptocurrency that is likely to keep delivering profits. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Rising Star of Memecoins with Real Utility While Ethereum (ETH) represents stability and growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is the exciting newcomer, offering explosive potential in the world of memecoins. Inspired by the legendary Pepecoin and the global appeal of professional soccer, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a meme token, it’s a movement that combines sports fandom, blockchain innovation, and community engagement. Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out in the crowded memecoin space by blending popular culture with financial technology. The token is designed to unite sports enthusiasts and crypto investors through a platform that offers entertainment, community, and financial rewards. But Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just about fun; it’s also about utility. By integrating with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides users with access to services such as lending, borrowing, and trading. This functionality adds real value to the token, making it more than just a speculative asset. Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe: A Winning Combination for Long-Term Success Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are two promising cryptocurrencies in the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum (ETH), known for its innovation and growth, is a cornerstone of any serious crypto portfolio. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a blend of meme culture, sports fandom, and DeFi integration, is emerging as a promising new addition. Both cryptocurrencies have the potential to generate profits now and continue to deliver returns in the future.

Recently, a significant shift has been observed as whales from Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are turning their attention to a new contender: Mpeppe (MPEPE). Priced at a mere $0.00177, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining traction as a new-generation cryptocurrency with the potential to reshape the market. Here’s why DOGE and SHIB whales are migrating to Mpeppe (MPEPE) and what it could mean for the future of decentralized finance and digital assets. The Appeal of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have long been the go-to memecoins for crypto enthusiasts. Both started as jokes but quickly amassed strong communities and saw incredible growth, largely driven by their viral appeal and the power of social media. Dogecoin (DOGE), with its origin as the original memecoin, paved the way, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) capitalized on the trend, branding itself as the “Dogecoin (DOGE) killer” and creating a DeFi ecosystem around its token. However, as the cryptocurrency market matures, even the most loyal Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are seeking out new opportunities that offer greater financial utility and growth potential. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE), a token that combines the fun of meme culture with the practical benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi). Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Frontier in Cryptocurrency Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly emerging as the next big thing in the crypto world, attracting attention not only for its low entry price of $0.00177 but also for its innovative approach to combining meme culture with decentralized finance. Mpeppe (MPEPE) facilitates financial services and transactions within DeFi protocols, offering functionality that goes beyond simple speculation. This ability to blend entertainment with real financial utility is what sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from traditional memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). By integrating DeFi elements, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides its community with access to a range of financial services, including lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming. These features add depth to Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s value proposition, making it a more versatile and attractive investment option for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolios. Why Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Whales Are Making the Switch The migration of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales to Mpeppe (MPEPE) is driven by several key factors. First and foremost is the potential for impressive returns. While both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have provided substantial gains in the past, their growth has slowed, leading many large holders to seek out new opportunities that offer greater upside potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its innovative features and low entry price, presents an attractive opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the next wave of growth in the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s integration with DeFi protocols offers a level of functionality that is not found in traditional memecoins. This added utility makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) more than just a speculative asset; it is a tool for financial growth and community engagement. For Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales who are accustomed to the volatility of the crypto market, the prospect of steady, long-term gains through DeFi activities such as yield farming and liquidity mining is a compelling reason to consider Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a key part of their investment strategy. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) – The New Generation Cryptocurrency on the Rise With its innovative approach to integrating DeFi with meme culture, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is well-positioned to deliver impressive returns and shape the future of decentralized finance. For Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors looking to diversify their portfolios and explore new horizons, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a compelling case for investment and a chance to be part of a transformative movement in the world of cryptocurrency.

The asset manager has lately focused on decentralized artificial intelligence (AI), having introduced an AI-focused digital asset trust, followed by two single asset funds: the Grayscale Bittensor Trust and Grayscale Sui Trust, that will hold the TAO and SUI tokens, respectively.  “Through its key strategic partnerships and unique, multi-chain structure, Avalanche is playing a pivotal role in the advancement of RWA tokenization,” said Grayscale’s head of product and research, Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, in a statement, referring to the process of creating a way of trading real-world assets on-chain.

42417354,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYDID,1724331600,Stablecoin Issuing System M^0 Employs Fireblocks for Crypto Custody,"Institutions that use Fireblocks for crypto key management workflows will work seamlessly with M^0’s stablecoin-minting and validation software.  The protocol aims to fill the gap between existing stablecoin systems, where all the yield goes to either the token issuers or the token holders.  M^0 (pronounced “M Zero”), a protocol that allows institutions to mint their own stablecoins backed by U.S. Treasury bills, reached an agreement for Fireblocks to provide cryptocurrency custody services to its issuers.  Firms using M^0 to mint cryptodollars use private keys to transfer them, update collateral balances, retrieve and burn tokens and interact with other participants in the ecosystem such as validators for checking reserves. Those keys now work seamlessly with Fireblocks' key-management system, the companies said.  ""We are creating these minter modules and validator modules to be as institutional ready as possible,” M^0 Labs CEO Luca Prosperi said in an interview. “So when a party like a large market maker or trading desk, for example, comes and says they want to become a minter, but have their key management system on Fireblocks, then you can integrate it in a seamless way with them. We are doing this because we think no one is as well equipped as Fireblocks to do such sophisticated workflow and key management systems for crypto assets.""  M^0 Labs develops the software for the protocol, which is governed by the decentralized M^0 Foundation.  The organization also highlights what it says is a unique feature of its business model: revenue sharing  The success of stablecoin issuers like Tether, whose USDT is the largest by market cap, and Circle, producer of the No. 2, USDC, have focused attention on the industry and seeded a new crop of dollar-pegged tokens. Those tokens are generally backed by yield-generating reserves, typically U.S. Treasury bills.  In existing models either the issuer, such as Tether or Circle, keeps all yield, or the interest payment accrues to the token holder. There’s a need for more flexible system, Prosperi said.  M^0 allows protocol users to wrap stablecoins such that they can opt to keep the yield in its entirety or they can do more complicated things like share a proportion with certain people based on what they do, he said.  “Between these two dumb solutions, where issuers either keep 100% of the yield, or the other extreme where holders keep 100% of the yield – even if they don't need to – there is no space to incentivize distribution unless through cumbersome paper-based marketing contracts,” Prosperi said. “This technology allows issuers or holders of M to create arbitrarily complex logic to manage the yield in order to incentivize their own ecosystem. And this opens up a wide range of fully on-chain opportunities and business models.”  M^0 has so far gathered a float of around $30 million that is already over collateralized, with reserves independently validated on-chain every 30 hours, Prosperi said. The service is not available to users in the U.S.",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/22/stablecoin-issuing-system-m0-employs-fireblocks-for-crypto-custody,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73c306ae4ae49d1b24a72631039b7a5672a04802-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417358,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYDLJ,1724331600,NEAR Blockchain Gets Major Upgrade to Add 'Stateless Validation',"NEAR Protocol has deployed a major upgrade known as ""Nightshade 2.0"" on its main network, designed to improve the scalability and usability of the blockchain.  New features include ""stateless validation,"" a concept that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has written about extensively, according to a press release from the NEAR Foundation, which supports the blockchain.  NEAR ranks as just the 25th biggest blockchain by the website DeFILlama, but the project tends to be closely watched in crypto tech circles partly because of the credentials of its founder, Illia Polosukhin, who earlier in his career was a top engineer at Google working on AI systems.  The upgrade is part of NEAR's efforts to incorporate ""sharding"" in its core design – splitting the blockchain up into smaller pieces which is supposed to scale the network, allowing the network to process more transactions for cheaper. Ethereum has its own roadmap for achieving full sharding, and recently implemented the feature of proto-danksharding, the first iteration of this concept.  “NEAR validators no longer have to maintain the state of a shard locally and can retrieve all the information they need to validate state changes, or 'state witnesses,' from the network,"" according to the press release. ""This both improves single-shard performance as well as adds capacity for more shards on the network.”  Nightshade has been on the NEAR roadmap for years, with the first version introduced in 2022. NEAR co-founder Illia Polosukhin published a white paper about the original Nightshade in 2019.  “Nightshade 2.0 is a fundamental reworking of NEAR sharding and is a major milestone in NEAR’s development roadmap that will greatly increase NEAR’s efficiency and scalability,” said Bowen Wang, the head of protocol at NEAR, in the press release.  “In particular, the new sharding implementation will speed up NEAR’s already-fast transaction throughput by five times. It also substantially lowers the cost of operating validators, lowering the barrier to entry for more people to become validators, which will improve the decentralization of the network.”  Read more: Near Blockchain Moves Ahead With Phase One of Sharding Upgrade",POSITIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | NEAR,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/08/22/near-blockchain-gets-major-upgrade-to-add-stateless-validation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cfe0d5a42cd7c3342820258e81c49703f81e3e56-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32719011,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637093,1724329818,"September 10: A Bitcoin Game Changer, Says Hedge Fund Founder","Travis Kling, the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Ikigai Asset Management, is proposing a direct link between the US presidential election outcomes and the Bitcoin price. Via X, Kling delves into the political dynamics and their perceived implications for crypto markets, particularly focusing on the potential re-election of Donald Trump. Why September 10 Could Be Crucial For Bitcoin Kling’s analysis hinges on several key political events and their corresponding impacts on betting markets, which he believes are reflective of broader economic expectations. “NFA. I’m wrong often. Bitcoin has likely been trading with a correlation to Trump winning. And that makes sense to me. BTC/crypto will be MUCH better off under a Trump admin,” Kling stated. He emphasized the Democratic National Convention’s perceived shortcomings and an expected endorsement of Trump by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as pivotal moments that could drive the Bitcoin price. “The DNC does not appear to be going particularly well. RFK is supposed to be endorsing Trump on Friday. These factors are showing up on Polymarket and if RFK goes for Trump, I would guess Poly would widen out further,” Kling noted. He anticipates these developments will peak on September 10. Related Reading: Historical Data Suggests Bitcoin Could Rise 1,000%, Here’s Why This is when the first debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will be in Philadelphia. “It’s Trump’s to lose IMO. If he shows up for Kamala the way he showed up for Biden, polls/Poly should widen further still.” Kling expects the Bitcoin price to surge towards $72,000. “Given that BTC is trading with Trump, it would make sense to me that all this would add up to BTC being back up to the top of this 6-month range,” Kling speculated. However, he also warned of too much optimism. Kling is unsure if the BTC price can break out of the trading range established in mid-March “prior to the election, unless polls/Poly REALLY widen out for Trump. Hate it or love it, this election is highly consequential for us, short-term price action just being one aspect of that.” Notably, not everyone is sharing Kling’s opinion. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, provided a contrasting perspective. Sigel stated, “Bitcoin is Not Currently Trading With Trump Odds, Though I Expect That to Change. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Brink Of Massive Breakout Like Gold In 2008: Hedge Fund CEO FalconX, a prominent crypto prime broker, also recently conducted an analysis which scrutinized the correlation between Bitcoin prices and Trump’s electoral odds on Polymarket—a platform for betting on political outcomes. From June 1 to August 15, their findings indicated no apparent correlation, underscoring that other factors might have influenced Bitcoin’s price more significantly. These factors included the 50,000 BTC sell-off by the German government and liquidations by former customers of Mt. Gox. Undoubtedly a coalition of Trump and Kennedy Jr.’s would be extremely bullish for Bitcoin. While it enhances Trump’s odds of winning the US election, another strong Bitcoin supporter would join the Trump campaign. Kennedy Jr., like Trump, has advocated for substantial government involvement in Bitcoin, proposing that the Treasury Department should purchase 550 Bitcoins daily until it amasses 4 million BTC in reserves. At press time, BTC traded at $61,067.

Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,968 +2.8%  Bitcoin (BTC): $61,253 +3.0%  Ether (ETH): $2,638 +2.0%  S&P 500: 5,620.85 +0.4%  Gold: $2,541 +1.3%  Nikkei 225: 38,211.01 +0.68%  Top Stories  Bitcoin rallied during the late European morning having zigzagged between $59,000 and $61,000, and climbed to around $61,250, a 24-hour increase of nearly 3%. Some news outlets reported late Wednesday that Robert Kennedy Jr. was planning to drop out of the U.S. presidential race by the end of this week and would endorse Donald Trump, who has positioned himself as a pro-crypto president if elected. Polymarket bettors give the withdrawal an almost 94% chance of it happening, a major shift from earlier in the week. The broader digital asset market is nearly 2.75% higher than 24 hours ago, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index.  Nearly half of all corporate political contributions in the 2024 election cycle came from cryptocurrency companies, according to a Wednesday report from corporate influence watchdog Public Citizen. The report found that, so far, 48% of corporate election spending has come from crypto companies like Ripple and Coinbase. That’s $119 million out of a total of $248 million. The vast majority of those donations have been funneled into pro-crypto super political action committees (PACs) like Fairshake as well as squashing the bids of crypto skeptics. Just under $108 million of the $203 million raised by Fairshake has come directly from crypto companies, according to the report. The rest came from large donations made by deep-pocketed and prominent individuals, like the Winklevoss twins and Brian Armstrong.  One year ago, HashKey Capital forecast that ether liquid-staking derivatives would double from their August 2023 total value locked to $44 billion by August 2025. Halfway through, it looks like things are on track. The TVL of Ether LSDs hit $36.25 billion, with Lido claiming a 70% market share, according to data from DeFiLlama. Despite relatively stagnant ETH prices recently, demand for staking continues to rise, with the validator entry queue surging to an all-time high of around 7,400, HashKey Capital analysts wrote in a note to CoinDesk. ""However, annualized staking yields have remained at around 3.5% for the past four months. This creates a situation where more validators want to join but rewards are not increasing substantially.""  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the going market rate of the top 500 cryptocurrencies by market value relative to their highs and lows in previous years, starting from 2021.  As of Aug. 20, over 100 tokens traded below their 2021 lows, 80 below the bear market lows of 2022 and 72 below their 2023 lows.  It's a sign that investors are deploying capital in newer, ""more promising"" tokens, according to CCData.

32717347,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637096,1724326248,"XRP Smashes Through Resistance, Could Soar 15%, Analyst Says","Ripple’s XRP is on a rampage, breaking through a key resistance level of late. The move has analysts eyeing the crypto asset for a potentially big gain, with many, like Bret Hill, suggesting as such. Related Reading: Tron Rises 24% Amid New Developments – Will The Uptrend Continue? Meanwhile, Pastor Brandon Biggs is doing rounds on social media with his “prophetic” prediction of an “overnight” surge in the price of XRP. Against this backdrop, XRP is currently trading at the level of $0.603, which is a 4% in profit over the past 24 hours. Over a seven-day period, the digital asset managed to soar in price by almost 5%, but its monthly gain was more modest at 1.29%. Several factors are driving this momentum from technical analysis to more speculative influences. Let’s jump into what’s going on with XRP and what could be next. Analyst’s Bullish Comments One of the big voices right now in the XRP room is crypto analyst Bret Hill. He just pointed out the importance of this break above consolidation, as seen by XRP’s recent movements. 🚀 **XRP/USDT Daily Chart Update:** The XRP/USDT pair has just **blasted through its consolidation phase** with a **bullish breakout** that’s got the charts screaming “LFG!” The price has surged to **$0.6054**, and the momentum is clearly with the bulls. **Next Big Target:**… pic.twitter.com/Qp6HLL6pEn — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) August 20, 2024 This, according to Hill, paves the way for further upside toward the next resistance level target of $0.684—the very level that will not be a walk in the park for the bulls. This level of interest isn’t a usual random one, but rather, a critical point that, once breached, shall signal larger upside waves. Traders should now eye the $0.684 level. If the altcoin can finally break over this critical level, it may be the spark for greater gains. The excitement is tangible in the market, and this excitement could prove to be the fuel propelling XRP to higher prices. Prophetic Predictions Rouse Interest While technical analyses present one view, there is another controversial perspective covered. One of the most famous Christian prophets, Pastor Brandon Biggs, hit the headlines lately on his latest prediction related to XRP. Particularly, Biggs claims that XRP could experience an overnight surge that will see the cryptocurrency regain its past glory. His prophecy, although speculative, caught eyes in the crypto community. He described a vision of a financial shift tied to the crypto, with a “rapid acceleration” in the token’s value. He believes it could be so fast that it catches investors by surprise. By no means are these based on traditional market analysis, yet his predictions do add an intriguing layer to the ongoing conversation about XRP. And, for those few that believe Biggs truly does see the bigger picture, then XRP may mean something other than a financial asset—that XRP may be part of an even bigger, spiritually significant event. Related Reading: Celestia: Market Dip Leaves TIA Investors 16% In The Red Market Sentiment And Investor Behavior In this respect, the technicals on XRP suggest that the cryptocurrency could be poised for higher prices. On the other hand, we see speculative and “spiritual” predictions by Biggs, which make the situation even more intriguing. XRP Price Forecast XRP looks to subject itself to a trending move in the coming seven days, as the market points to the possibility of a bullish performance, data from crypto price prediction platform CoinCheckup shows. Currently, the value is transacting 20% down from its forecast for the coming month, which means that there can be a possible temporary dip before a climactic shift upwards. Traders will most likely benefit from the projected gains derivable during what looks like a short-lived correction. Technical indicators are pointing towards XRP gaining momentum, which could buoy the price higher as market sentiment improves. Looking at a three-month timescale ahead, it appears that XRP will witness an upsurge of 25%, while the view is steadily bullish over the next six months, showing approximately 170% growth.

32717057,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637206,1724325688,Ethereum Price Ready to Climb if It Overcomes Key Resistance,"Ethereum price is consolidating above the $2,550 resistance. ETH could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,650 resistance zone. Ethereum is struggling to gain pace for a move above the $2,650 level. The price is trading above $2,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $2,640 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above $2,650. Ethereum Price Starts Consolidation Ethereum price remained stable above the $2,550 level. ETH formed a base and started a steady upward move above the $2,580 level like Bitcoin. There was a move toward the $2,665 level. A high was formed at $2,662 and the price is consolidating. There was a minor pullback below the $2,600 level. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,536 swing low to the $2,662 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is another increase, the price might face hurdles near the $2,650 level. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $2,640 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $2,720 level. A close above the $2,720 level might send Ether toward the $2,750 resistance. The next key resistance is near $2,880. An upside break above the $2,880 resistance might send the price higher toward the $3,000 resistance zone in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,650 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near $2,600. The first major support sits near the $2,580 zone. The 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,536 swing low to the $2,662 high is also near the $2,580 level. A clear move below the $2,580 support might push the price toward $2,550 where the bulls could emerge. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,500 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,440. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

32714833,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637047,1724320803,Bitcoin’s MVRV Ratio Nears Critical Death Cross: Will The Market See A Bearish Shift?,"A recent analysis from a CryptoQuant analyst has raised concerns over Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Momentum. The MVRV ratio, a critical indicator in on-chain analysis, represents the ratio between Bitcoin’s realized and market values. It serves as a tool to assess whether the market is overvalued or undervalued. By applying 30-day and 365-day moving averages (DMA) to this ratio, the analyst has observed a shift in market momentum, potentially signaling a major market move ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Action Watch: 3 Pivotal Zones That Could Sway BTC’s Next Move A Bearish Shift On The Horizon? In the latest assessment, the analyst under the name ‘Yonsei Dent’ highlights that Bitcoin’s 30-day moving average has sharply declined since reaching an all-time high in March 2024. This decline has brought the 30 DMA dangerously close to crossing the 365 DMA; a situation often referred to as a “death cross” in technical analysis. For context, a death cross is where a shorter-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average. In Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio, a death cross would occur if the 30-day moving average (DMA) falls below the 365-day moving average (DMA). Historically, such events have often preceded bearish market phases, making this a critical juncture for Bitcoin. Dent particularly noted: In the previous cycle, after the MVRV momentum experienced a death cross, the market entered a full-blown bearish phase. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor whether the 30 DMA continues to decline. If the 30 DMA finds support at the 365 DMA and starts to rise again, it could signal a potential increase in BTC’s price. Furthermore, Dent highlighted that the current Bitcoin MVRV ratio now ranges between 1.8 and 1.9, suggesting that the market value is nearly double the realized value, indicating that while the market is not yet under significant stress, caution is warranted. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Bitcoin Bull Run Top With Historically Proven Indicator Bitcoin Technical Outlook While Dent’s analysis of the Bitcoin MVRV ratio signals a critical juncture for Bitcoin, another renowned analyst, Javon Marks has recently set an ambitious target for Bitcoin based on its recent price action. According to Marks, BTC still comes from a major Hidden Bull Divergence pattern. However, key levels remain at $67,559, which can be a precursor to a significant rally from BTC. Marks noted: With a break + hold that target, $116,652 comes into play, and prices could set for an additional +72% climb to reach it, at an even greater speed than many think. All of Bitcoin’s recent chop after meeting $67,559 the first time may have only been preparation for this next phase into the $100,000s. Meanwhile, Bitcoin still trades below $60,000 with a current trading price of $59,864, at the time of writing. According to crypto analyst Elja, the asset’s price keeps rejecting from the 4hr 200 EMA level. Should Bitcoin eventually surpass this level, we could see a surge to $64,000. $BTC keeps getting rejected from the 4hr 200 EMA level Flip and turn it into support and #Bitcoin will pump towards $64K-$65K Otherwise, the consolidation will continue to happen! pic.twitter.com/YIoGrVinCG — Elja (@Eljaboom) August 21, 2024 Featured image created witH DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-mvrv-ratio-nears-critical-death-cross/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/32714833.jpeg

Bond is under investigation by Manhattan federal prosecutors over allegations of campaign finance violations related to contributions made by Salame and others to her 2022 congressional campaign.  Salame pled guilty to campaign finance violations in September 2023, CoinDesk reported at the time. In May, Salame was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison for the campaign finance violations as well as running an unlicensed money transmitting business – charges that resulted from his role as one of the organizers of FTX's fiat-to-crypto payment rails.  Now Salame's attorneys argue that his plea was improperly induced by promises from prosecutors to protect Bond, the mother of his child, from further legal scrutiny.  ""Yet despite Salame’s cooperation,"" Salame's attorneys argue in the filing, ""The Government failed to honor its implied commitment not to pursue the campaign-finance charges against Bond.""  The filing states that federal prosecutors ""used the plea negotiations to threaten Salame’s domestic partner and the mother of his child, Michelle Bond,"" and that the government conveyed it ""would discontinue investigating Bond if Salame pleaded guilty.""  Salame’s attorneys are now requesting that the court either enforce the government’s initial promise to drop the investigation into Bond or vacate Salame’s conviction altogether.  ""Salame is entitled to hold the Government to its assurance by either withdrawing his plea or obtaining an order directing specific performance,"" the document argues.  Publicly, Salame remains defiant, posting on X that he hopes his court filing ""encourages more people to be honest and tell the truth and expose un-American tactics.""  ""I hope it helps at least one person in the future; the justice system is fragile but so important,"" he continued.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/22/former-ftx-executive-ryan-salame-claims-government-backtracked-on-plea-deal-filing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16fff0c84c3c4e7f7175794e8555c952903ce0f1-1116x628.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
32713066,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637049,1724317258,"AAVE Breaks Out Of 2-Year Accumulation Range, Is A Parabolic Run Ahead?","AAVE has become one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies this month. Throughout August’s market retraces, AAVE has remained among the few tokens registering green numbers in most timeframes. The cryptocurrency recently broke above a crucial level, which made investors and analysts turn their eyes to the token. Its recent performance suggests a parabolic run is around the corner. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Continues Sideways Move As Outflows Record $39 Million AAVE Shows Strength Amid Market Crashes AAVE, the native token of the crypto lending protocol with the same name, has had one of the best performances in August. The token rose 43.7% in the last 30 days, showing its strength throughout the market fluctuations. After the market crash on August 5, the cryptocurrency fell over 28% to $79. However, the token quickly recovered most of its price before regaining its pre-retrace levels earlier this week. The bullish price action has propelled AAVE over 33.3% and 35.5% in the weekly and biweekly timeframes to levels not seen since the Q1 highs. On Monday, the token retested the $120 resistance level before successfully breaking above it on Tuesday. This performance meant a breakout from a multi-year accumulation range, which was only briefly tested during March’s rally. At the time, AAVE’s price soared above the $150 resistance level before retracing, a range not seen since 2022. Whales noticed AAVE’s performance, recently purchasing and withdrawing over 31,407 tokens worth around $3.92 million. Some market watchers noted the token’s price action, suggesting it is one of the “few alts that look interesting.” Is a Parabolic Run Or Correction Coming? Daan Crypto Trades revealed that the token was breaking out of a 2.5-year accumulation range. To Daan, a successful breakout above this level and holding of it could “lead to quick expansion higher.” Today, the token successfully reclaimed the $130 support level before attempting to retest the $140 mark. Based on its recent performance, the trader deems the cryptocurrency “still looking great.” Additionally, he believes that “things can get really fun” since the price is eyeing the cycle highs of $154. However, he reminded investors that a consolidation above the $115 level is possible as “nothing goes up in 1 straight line.” AAVE’s performance was also highlighted by other market watchers who suggested the cryptocurrency might experience a parabolic run towards the $264 and $294 price range. Crypto trader Suen believes the token “might also become a top narrative in Q4 this year.” Despite the bullish forecasts, Ali Martinez revealed that AAVE could see a significant correction soon. The token’s TD Sequential recently flashed a sell signal in the daily chart. Per the analyst, the last four times this signal appeared, an average correction of 27% followed them.

42417368,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYGlx,1724314312,"Bitcoin Flipflops; MATIC, LINK Surge as Dim Market Action Continues","Bitcoin (BTC) trades sideways between $59,900 and $61,000. The overall crypto market cap slightly retreated to $2.1 trillion after failing to break through the $2.15 trillion mark.  Major tokens like ETH, SOL, and BNB saw minor gains, while TRX dropped after a rally. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows were weak, indicating a lack of new institutional interest.  Meanwhile, as one firm predicted, the total value locked in Ether Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) is on track to double by August 2025.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} zigzagged between $61,000 and $59,900 in the past 24 hours, continuing its sideways price action amid the lack of notable catalysts to fuel a move in either direction.  BTC spiked late Wednesday as U.S. job growth for the 12-months ending in March 2024 was 818,000 lower than previously reported.  Separately, some news outlets reported that Robert Kennedy Jr. was planning to drop out of the 2024 presidential race by the end of this week and would endorse Republican Donald Trump, who has positioned himself as a pro-crypto President if elected. Polymarket bettors give it an almost 94% chance of it happening, a major shift from earlier in the week.  The price jump was short-lived, however, as traders quickly took profits and sent BTC tumbling back to as low as $59,900. It recovered to over $60,800 in Asian trading hours Thursday, leading to slight market-wide gains.  “The crypto market once again failed to break through the $2.15 trillion cap mark, falling 2.3% to $2.1 trillion, almost back to where it started Tuesday,” shared FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich in a note. “From the technical analysis side, Bitcoin retreated to the downside after another test of its 50-day average - ranging for the past six days.  “Yesterday, the main institutional demand seemed to be for other assets, such as gold,” he added. The precious metal set record highs on Tuesday amid a weaker dollar and buying by investors favoring safer assets.  Inflows into U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remained muted, with only $39 million in net flows on Wednesday. Slow inflows are signaling a lack of new demand among professional investors, as reported, putting bearish pressure on BTC.  Meanwhile, major tokens ether {{ETH}}, Solana’s SOL, and BNB Chain’s BNB rose as much as 2%, while dogecoin {{DOGE}} and xrp (XRP) were little changed. Tron’s TRX dropped 4.5% after a Wednesday rally on the back of a newly released memecoin generator.  The liquid CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, which tracks the largest tokens by market cap, rose 1.54%.  Polygon’s MATIC rose 12% as it neared a token migration that will switch the existing MATIC to POL - a unified token that can be used across all of Polygon’s blockchains. Chainlink’s LINK rose 15% as its data feeds were implemented on the lending market Aave’s new release on the zkSync blockchain - signalling more demand for the token.  LSD on track to doubling  One year ago, HashKey Capital forecasted that Ether Liquid Staking Derivatives would double from their August 2023 total value locked of roughly $22 billion to $44 billion by August 2025. Half way through that forecast, and it looks like things are on track per their forecast.  According to data from DeFiLlama, the TVL of Ether LSD's hit $36.25 billion with Lido claiming a 70% market share.  ""Despite relatively stagnant ETH prices recently, demand for staking continues to rise, with the validator entry queue surging to an all-time high of around 7,400, HashKey Capital analysts wrote in a note to CoinDesk. ""However, annualized staking yields have remained at around 3.5% for the past four months. This creates a situation where more validators want to join but rewards are not increasing substantially.""  Over the past year, analysts noted, ETH staking and LSDs have experienced significant growth, despite challenges related to incentives and ETH’s long-term role within its ecosystem.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LINK | MATIC,BTC | LINK | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,"Shaurya Malwa, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/22/bitcoin-flipflops-matic-link-surge-as-dim-market-action-continues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/967e160d487b8a89e9334e52bb03d1744aa064cb-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analyst Reveals Key Levels to Watch,"Amid Bitcoin’s continuous consolidation below the $61,000 price mark over the past weeks, renowned trading guru Peter Brandt, with decades of experience in the financial markets, has recently shared an update on his outlook for Bitcoin and Ethereum. His analysis comes at a time when both of these assets have been unable to maintain a strong rally in the past weeks but have only continued to see consistent plunges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Surge in Demand: Are We At The Final Phase of Consolidation? Bitcoin And Ethereum Next Move In his latest update, Brandt identifies a “megaphone” or “expanding triangle” pattern on Bitcoin’s weekly and daily charts. This pattern, characterized by increasingly wider price swings, often signals that the market is building up for a major move to the upside or downside. However, despite the meaning of this pattern, Brandt cautions that a “clear trend” has not yet emerged for Bitcoin. Commenting under Brandt’s post, an X user asked the trading guru about the factors that could signal a resumption of Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend, noting: What is more relevant in assessing the long term uptrend has resumed? Breaking above the diagonal resistance line or breaking above the horizontal line at 74k? To this, Brandt provided a straightforward perspective, disapproving the significance of “Diagonal resistance.” The analyst particularly noted: “Diagonal resistance means nothing to me.” In addition to his analysis of Bitcoin, Peter Brandt also shared his thoughts on Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Brandt’s outlook for Ethereum remains cautious, as he observes that the altcoin is still on the “defensive.” Charts of continuing interest are Bitcoin and Ether. Weekly and daily graphs continue to form a megaphone or broadening triangle pattern in BTC No declaration of next trend yet $BTC$ETH will remain defensive unless/until close above 3050 occurs pic.twitter.com/aEESwhX5oC — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) August 20, 2024 He identifies the $3,050 level as a critical resistance point for Ethereum. According to Brandt, Ethereum will not exhibit bullish strength until it closes above this key level. Until then, a bearish bias will likely persist, with the potential for further declines if the price fails to break through this resistance. BTC And ETH Market Performance So far, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have been struggling to achieve any notable high following the significant plunge to lower levels earlier this month on August 5. BTC has ranged between $59,000 and slightly above $60,000 in the past week. Although the asset is up 1.3% over this period, it remains in the range with BTC’s current market price at $59,445 at the time of writing. As for Ethereum, the asset’s performance has also slightly mirrored that of BTC. Following ETH’s plunge to $2,197 earlier this month, the asset has continued to range below the $3,000 price mark. At the time of writing, ETH traded for $2,590, up by 0.1% in the past day.

As of writing, the second most valuable coin is inside a narrow range, trending within the $2,100 on the lower end and $2,800 on the upper end. The local resistance level could mark the start of an impressive leg up, relieving the coin of the current sell grip from early August. Ethereum Whales Selling Although supporters are upbeat, expecting the coin to trend higher, breaking above local liquidation lines in a buy trend continuation formation, there are concerns. Looking at Ethereum price action, the coin could post even more losses. Related Reading: XRP Alert: Raoul Pal Advises Investors To Sell Now – Here’s Why One analyst, citing on-chain developments, notes that Ethereum whales, or addresses holding at least 10,000 ETH, have been actively selling over the past month. Overall, their decision to sell could suggest that these entities, who are often closely monitored, are not confident about what lies ahead. Therefore, others could follow suit by unloading their holdings, leading to a supply glut. Considering market forces, an uptick in supply could negatively impact prices, delaying the climb above the immediate roadblocks. Massive Outflows From Spot ETH ETFs Beyond this, analysts are also deflated by the current trends of spot Ethereum ETFs. In May, prices shot higher when the United SEC unexpectedly fast-tracked the approval of 19b-4 forms for applicants. The approval of the S-1 registration forms was also received positively, lifting prices above the $3,000 mark. However, days after the product began trading, there were more outflows, especially from Grayscale’s ETHE. Concurrently, demand has been lower than expected. Since its inception, over $247 million worth of ETH has been redeemed from ETHE. Subsequently, prices have been struggling and moving further away from March 2024 highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Surge in Demand: Are We At The Final Phase of Consolidation? According to Farside data, all spot Ethereum ETF issuers posted outflows of around $6.5 million on August 20. This is mostly thanks to the millions of dollars of redemption through ETHE. This has been a consistent trend since August 15. It suggests that though the smart contracts platform offers value, ETH’s immediate to medium-term outlook is bearish. Accordingly, investors are choosing to move their capital elsewhere.

Gox Impact And Future Outlook,"Summary Bitcoin prices are currently range-bound, the range between 56,561 and 61,750 is keeping both buyers and sellers cautious. Mt. Gox moved 13,265 bitcoins in total and estimated $780 million. The first major move by the bankrupt exchange since July 30. According to research by investment firm River, 60% of the largest hedge funds in the U.S. have exposure to Bitcoin ETFs. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin prices continue to trade sideways as the range high held yesterday before prices slid. The 61600 range high is holding firm, but yesterday saw Bitcoin fail at the 50-day MA, languishing around 61400. Overnight news broke that Mt. Gox had made its first major move in 3 weeks. The bankrupt former exchange moved a total of 13265 Bitcoins, with an estimated value of around $780 million. Source: x.com, On Chain Data The move could be a precursor to Mt. Gox continuing its repayments to creditors. Mt. Gox had already moved 47229 Bitcoin on July 30th. In a move that has surprised some, Mt. Gox creditors have held on to their Bitcoin instead of selling it. Bitpanda's deputy CEO, Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, told Cointelegraph earlier this August that it's important to remember Mt. Gox was one of the first exchanges. This means its users were among the early adopters of Bitcoin and thus believe in the technology. This could in part explain why they are refusing to sell the world's largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is trading up around 0.6% on the day, but these developments are likely to keep downward pressure on the price of BTC/USD. Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have had more money coming in than going out for eight of the last ten trading days. On August 20, these ETFs received $88 million, which is the most they've gotten in two weeks, according to early data from Farside Investors. According to a recent report by Sam Baker, Researcher at Investment Firm River, 60% of the largest hedge funds in the United States have exposure to Bitcoin ETFs. This is big for Bitcoin and could explain why, despite the massive selloff early in August, prices have recovered some sense of stability. There is a theory that with more institutional adoption, Bitcoin may lose some of its volatility; however, the drop in early August suggests this may be somewhat misguided. I guess time will tell where this one is concerned. El Salvador Continues to Innovate El Salvador's National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) is offering Bitcoin training and certifications to 80,000 government workers. The country has started this program to teach public employees about managing and creating policies for Bitcoin. The training, called Certification in Public Administration 1, lasts 160 hours and is done online. It's divided into seven parts, each covering different concepts, laws, skills, and management for using Bitcoin as legal money. Source: X/Bitcoin Office This follows El Salvador giving transparency a new meaning earlier this year. The Country launched its own proof-of-reserves website which provides real time data of the countries Bitcoin reserves. As the week progresses, we do have the FOMC minutes this evening, which could provide markets with a shot in the arm and stir up some volatility. Markets are a bit calm at the moment as Jackson Hole beckons with all eyes on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Market participants will be looking for more cues regarding the rate path of the Federal Reserve moving forward and this could have an impact on riskier assets such as Bitcoin Technical Analysis BTC/USD From a technical perspective, Bitcoin is currently stuck in a price range, with a recent dip almost breaking out but not succeeding. The range between 56,561 and 61,750 is keeping both buyers and sellers cautious. The longer Bitcoin stays in this range, the more likely a strong breakout will happen, although it's uncertain which direction it will take. Some crypto enthusiasts are predicting a bullish breakout, with some even suggesting a rise to 100,000, though that seems unlikely at this point. In the short term, resistance is at 60,000, with more challenges at the 50-day moving average and range high around 61,750. Beyond that, there are additional hurdles at the 200 and 100-day moving averages at 62,917 and 63,870 before buyers can take full control.

BTC is now consolidating gains, and the bulls could aim for a move above the $62,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin started a consolidation phase above the $60,000 zone. The price is trading above $59,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $59,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might attempt a fresh increase if it clears the $61,500 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Holds Gains Bitcoin price remained stable above the $58,500 pivot level. BTC formed a base and started a steady increase above the $60,000 resistance zone. The price climbed above the $60,200 and $60,500 resistance levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $61,800 swing high to the $59,805 low. The current price action is positive and seems like the bulls could aim for more gains above the $60,800 resistance zone. Bitcoin is now trading above $60,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. The price is now consolidating near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $61,800 swing high to the $59,805 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $60,800 level. The first key resistance is near the $61,800 level. A clear move above the $61,800 resistance might send the price further higher in the coming sessions. The next key resistance could be $62,000. A close above the $62,000 resistance might spark more upsides. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $63,500 resistance. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $61,800 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $60,200 level. The first major support is $59,800. The next support is now near the $58,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $58,000 support zone or even $57,500 in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.

This achievement has driven a nearly 9% increase in Toncoin’s value, standing out in contrast to the broader market’s downward trend. Maartunn, an analyst at CryptoQuant Research, claims that since July 2021, the TON Masterchain’s active address count has skyrocketed more than sevenfold. This notable uptick points to growing blockchain adoption, which drives more transactions and general network activity. User Activity Boosts Toncoin Demand The rise in active addresses highlights how continuously the TON ecosystem is building. Expanding the network allows for more diverse distributed apps (dApps) and work chains, which shows healthy blockchain development. Related Reading: Toncoin Rally Thwarted As TON Slips To $6, Can Bulls Prevent A Bearish Breakdown? Due to extensive inflow, the demand for TON coins has increased. More network activity affects the general economic condition of the TON blockchain, which is usually linked to a surge in token value. It’s important to note that this number reflects activity on the Master chain alone despite the seemingly modest figure of 946 daily active addresses. The TON blockchain operates with multiple sidechains, named workchains, which handle most data management. The Masterchain primarily focuses on processing messages and transactions rather than storing data. This result shows a growing interest in the TON network, as increasing user and developer involvement usually stimulates the demand for TON tokens. TON Price Outlook The price of Toncoin (TON) is down 2.8% at the time of writing, trading at $6.67. Since the price drop, the trading volume has also dropped by 23% to about $227 million. Toncoin is the 8th largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $16.8 billion. Analysts pay close attention to the $7 level for Toncoin, a key support level. If Toncoin goes above this mark, it might keep bullish momentum. Examining the TON spike of 26% over the next two weeks can predict its yearly surge of more than 400%. However, if the price falls below $6.43, it could decrease, testing support around $6.04. According to IntoThe Block analytics, the TON network has surpassed 39.5 million addresses. This milestone highlights its growing popularity and strong network, attracting institutional and retail investors. Related Reading: Toncoin Rally Above 4-Hour 100-Day SMA Puts TON On The Path To $7.6 The derivatives market in TON is not trending positively. Futures traders are looking for short bets. Coinglass data shows the coin’s funding rate has been mostly negative across exchanges this month. In the last 24 hours, the price of TON rotated from $6.74 to $6.93.

Other indicators like the MACD also suggest the same.  Since November 2022, bitcoin's {{BTC}} price has surged nearly 300% from lows around $15,470. This remarkable uptrend is now challenged by a looming ""stochastics overbought downturn"" signal, according to technical analysis by Fairlead Strategies.  Stochastics is a momentum oscillator technical analysts and traders use to compare a security's going market rate to a range of prices over a certain period, typically 14 days, weeks, or months. The indicator fluctuates between 0 to 100, with readings above 80 indicating an overbought condition.  An ""overbought downturn"" has the oscillator moving down from the overbought territory above 80, signaling a weakening of the uptrend and potential for price declines.  Bitcoin's 14-month stochastic has crossed below 80. The overbought downturn will be confirmed if the situation persists through the end of August.  ""The monthly chart of bitcoin shows a pending overbought downturn in the monthly stochastics. If confirmed at month-end, it would be a negative catalyst, suggesting the trading range marked the end to the cyclical uptrend from the 2022 low,"" analysts at Fairlead Strategies said in a note shared with CoinDesk Wednesday.  Bitcoin's uptrend has stalled since March, with bulls repeatedly failing to establish a foothold above $70,000, as represented by the trendline resistance on the monthly chart.

As a result, crypto analyst will often use the historical performance of the coin to determine what might happen next. This time around, market expert PlanB has pointed to previous cycle performances that paint a bullish picture for Bitcoin going forward. Bitcoin Could Rise 1,000% In a post on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst PlanB proposed that the Bitcoin bull run is far from over. The crypto analyst points to previous cycles and how the Bitcoin price has performed to come to this conclusion. This comes with an initial leg up before a drawdown and then followed by an even larger run. Related Reading: Cardano Kicked Out Of Top 10 Crypto By Market Cap, What’s Going On? The analysis takes a look at the last two bull cycles with similarities that have played out both times. In the 2017 bull run, the Bitcoin price had seen an initial 4x increase before slowing down. While the slowdown looked to be the end of the bull market, it was only a short stop. What followed was a 10x market rally that sent the BTC price to new all-time highs. In the next bull cycle, which occurred between 2020 and 2021, the Bitcoin price would put on a similar play. There was an initial 4x increase that ended in 2020. This was followed by a slowdown before another rise. By the time the bull cycle was done, the BTC price had completed a 7x increase. Bitcoin increased 4x from the bottom in 2022 to now. Historically 7-10x follows from here. What do you think bitcoin will do next 12 months? pic.twitter.com/WtyO0u5RHn — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) August 21, 2024 Taking this into account and the fact that the current cycle is still following this trend, PlanB believes it’ll play out similarly. The crypto analyst points out that the Bitcoin price has already completed the first phase of this trend after rising 4x since 2022. If this trend plays out, then the BTC price could be headed for between a 700% and 1,000% price increase from here. Even if the BTC price were to see a diminished return like it did between the last two cycles, a continuation of the trend would still ensure a between 300% and 400% increase from here. Either way, it would mean that Bitcoin will eventually break the coveted $100,000 price target. How High Would A 1,000% Rally Be? Going by PlanB’s prediction, if the Bitcoin price were to finish in the bottom of the range with a 700% increase, then the price would be looking at at least $400,000 by the time the bull market is over. If it goes through to the top of the range with 1,000%, it would reach above $550,000.

32703993,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636933,1724299226,Bitcoin Investors Be Warned: Legendary MVRV Ratio About To  Death Cross,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio has recently been nearing in on a death cross formation. Bitcoin 30-Day MA MVRV Ratio May Be About To Cross Under 365-Day MA As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the MVRV Ratio is at risk of going through a death cross. The “MVRV Ratio” is a popular Bitcoin on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of how the value held by the investors (that is, the market cap) compares against the value put in by them (the realized cap). Related Reading: Bitcoin Resistance: Here Are The Challenges Ahead For BTC When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the investors as a whole are in a state of net profit right now. On the other hand, it being under this threshold suggests the dominance of loss in the market. Naturally, the MVRV Ratio being exactly equal to 1 implies the BTC holders are carrying exactly as much value as they initially put in, so they are just breaking-even. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio, as well as its 30-day and 90-day moving averages (MAs), over the past few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio had shot up to pretty high levels back in March when the cryptocurrency’s price had rallied to a new all-time high (ATH). But as investors have taken their profits and sold during the long consolidation phase that has followed since then, the indicator has gone down. That said, the indicator is still at a value of 1.88, which indicates the market cap is nearly twice the realized cap. Thus, the investors should still be quite comfortable. What can be concerning, however, is the speed at which the drawdown in the MVRV Ratio has occurred. From the chart, it’s visible that the 30-day MA of the metric has gone through a steep drop and is now retesting the 365-day MA. Historically, the 30-day MA of the MVRV Ratio crossing below the 365-day MA has usually led to a bearish phase for the cryptocurrency. Such a death cross last occurred near the end of 2021, foreshadowing the bear market that would follow in 2022. At present, the death cross in these MAs of the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio is yet to confirm, so the indicator can be to monitor in the near future. In the scenario that the 30-day MA continues in this trajectory and falls below the 365-day MA, BTC could end up witnessing another period with bears at the helm. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers To $61,000, Here Are The Possible Reasons There is also the possibility, however, that the indicator turns itself around and the death cross formation doesn’t actually end up taking shape. BTC Price Bitcoin had broken past the $61,000 level yesterday, but it would appear that the surge couldn’t last as the asset has already come down to $59,400.

The price spike also comes on the heels of Wednesday’s announcement of the final launch date for the blockchain’s much-anticipated Chang hard fork upgrade. The Chang hard fork, described as a significant evolution for the Cardano network, is set to establish a minimum viable on-chain governance system as outlined in CIP-1694. This upgrade will be rolled out in two stages, with the first introducing core governance features to the blockchain. Intersect Unveils Timeline For Chang Hard Fork As earlier reported by Bitcoinist, the Cardano ecosystem’s key member-based organization, Intersect, has announced that the Chang hard fork working group has reviewed the progress and community feedback, paving the way for the formal proposal of the upgrade’s launch timeline. Related Reading: Solana-Based Memecoin Rug Pulled By McDonald’s Hacker, Market Cap Plummets 98% The target date for the mainnet hard fork is set for Tuesday, August 27th, with a final decision scheduled for early Friday, August 23rd. This four-day lead time will allow for the necessary governance actions and sign-off on the hard fork. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson expressed his anticipation for the upcoming upgrade, stating, “Are you prepared for Chang? Rocket is on the pad. Governance is coming.” Cardano Prepares For Governance Evolution To align with the Chang hard fork, Input Output Global (IOG), the developer company behind the Cardano blockchain, has released a mandatory update to the Daedalus wallet, version 6.0.0. This update is essential for users to operate in the “Conway era” following the hard fork. The first stage of the Chang upgrade, dubbed Chang Upgrade #1, will introduce core governance features to the Cardano blockchain, marking the beginning of the “technical bootstrapping phase” as per CIP-1694. The second stage, Chang Upgrade #2, will further expand these governance implementations, effectively transitioning out of the bootstrapping phase and activating the comprehensive features outlined in CIP-1694.

According to CoinGecko, TIA, Celestia’s native toke, is down over 18% since last week, putting more pressure on the exhausted bulls as the bears eye more downward breakthroughs. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Nears Key Level As Analyst Eyes Over 100% Upside – Details Despite its native token’s downward trajectory, Celestia continues to innovate, keeping the bullish narrative alive. The question is if it is enough for a recovery of TIA in the long term.

The Zaar blockchain is built on Initia using the toolkit of Celestia. Although the latter is in a background role for the project, it still shows that the broader crypto community still regards Celestia as reliable. We’re excited to announce that @sudoswap will be launching on Zaar Chain on Day 1 along with our mainnet. We’re excited to be powering the first NFT marketplace on @initiaFDN with @CelestiaOrg underneath. Study The Fun Network. 💊🦴✨🔁 pic.twitter.com/GdcaNo8c24 — Zaar 💊 (@zaar_gg) August 20, 2024 Keeping this in mind, Celestia’s involvement with an NFT project might just be great timing. Although market interest in NFTs has faded ever since, some movement within the market. Just recently, the CryptoPunks collection led the NFT surge with over $825,000 in sales along with the offloading of CryptoPunks #5822 for an undisclosed amount. These small but big movements might spark interest in NFTs once again, pushing them from niche to mainstream. But before that can happen, development in the NFT space should continue as it recovers from lost retail interest. TIA Trading On Sustainable Price Range As of writing, the token is trading right between $4.8 and $5.9, keeping the bears from any possible breakthrough in the short to medium term. This trading range gives the bulls a strong and reliable jumping-off point in the coming days. At its current price point, accumulation should be the focus of the bulls in the next few weeks. However, TIA’s momentum is highly correlated with the swings of the broader market, making it susceptible to any change in the market’s sentiment. As of press time, TIA investors and traders are still bullish on the token’s future performance despite the extreme slip that occurred in its market. If this sentiment continues and investors rightly weigh in on the developments inside Celestia, we might see a reattempt to take lost ground above the $5.8 ceiling. Related Reading: End Of The Slump?

BTC is currently up ~34% year to date. Ether's price fell 5% this week and is now up ~9% year to date. XRP is currently down ~6% year to date. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Bitcoin's price inched down to $59,000 this past week. BTC is currently up ~34% year to date. Ether Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article with its launch in July 2015. Ether's price fell 5% this week and is now up ~9% year to date. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We've included it in this article for reference. XRP is currently down ~6% year to date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Bitcoin tops the chart. In other words, the price of a bitcoin has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies. On January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

Based on this, ETH looks to be headed for a new all-time high (ATH), surging past its current ATH of $4,800. Ethereum MVRV Shows Bottom Is In Data from the onchain analytics platform Glassnode shows that Ethereum’s market value to realized value (MVRV) lowest pricing level is at $1,687, which suggests that the bottom is already in for the crypto token. These MVRV pricing levels highlight how low or high a token will likely reach in a market cycle based on unrealized loss or unrealized profits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maintains Market Dominance With $42 Million In Inflows As such, Ethereum is unlikely to see a drop below the $1,687 price level and instead looks headed for its market top. It is worth mentioning that Ethereum dropped to as low as $2,200 following the market crash on August 5. That price level is close to the $2,109 MVRV pricing band, which Glassnode highlighted, further proving that the crypto has bottomed. Meanwhile, the shift to accumulation among Ethereum investors indicates that they are no longer looking to sell their assets but are holding in anticipation of higher prices. Data from Glassnode shows that the percentage of ETH’s supply held on exchanges has drastically declined to under 10%. This is significant as it potentially reduces the selling pressure on Ethereum and primes it for a massive rally as long as investors continue to hold. Data from Glassnode shows that Ethereum could rise above $5,000 and reach as high as $6,759, which is the highest MVRV pricing level for the crypto at the moment. That price level could mark a market top for Ethereum in this bull run, although crypto analysts like Tyler Durden have predicted that the crypto could still reach $10,000. Other Metrics That Support An Imminent Price Rally For ETH A recent blog post on the onchain analytics platform Cryptoquant highlighted two metrics that show that Ethereum is gearing up for its next leg up. One is the Taker Buy-Sell Ration, which calculates the ratio of Ethereum buyers to sellers. This metric is said to be positive again as Ethereum bulls are regaining strength and suppressing any selling pressure from the bears. Related Reading: Cardano Kicked Out Of Top 10 Crypto By Market Cap, What’s Going On? Ethereum’s open interest (OI) is again rising after dropping to $7 billion following the August 5 market crash. Data from Coinglass shows that the OI is currently at 10.81 billion, indicating that leveraged players are returning to the scene. This is significant as trading volume in the derivatives market also greatly impacts ETH’s price. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,590, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
