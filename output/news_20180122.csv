42400881,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLLVe,1516661746,US Senators Blast Venezuela's Oil-Backed Cryptocurrency Plan,"U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R.-Fl) and Robert Menendez (D.-NJ) have denounced Venezuela's planned cryptocurrency in a new letter.  In an open letter addressed to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Rubio and Menendez asked how the Treasury Department was monitoring Venezuela's plan to create its own oil-backed cryptocurrency, which the country's president, Nicolas Maduro, has said will help the country avoid global financial sanctions.  The two senators want to know how the department will move to prevent the country from using the ""petro"" to bypass American sanctions. The letter noted that Venezuela has spent several years in an economic crisis, resulting in a lack of access to basic resources for most citizens.  Rubio and Menendez wrote:  ""We have serious doubts about whether Venezuela has the capacity to launch a cryptocurrency, but regardless, it is imperative that the U.S. Treasury Department is equipped with tools and enforcement mechanisms to combat the use of cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions in general, and in this case in particular.""  The project has sparked its share of controversy even within its home country, with the nation's Congress denouncing it as illegal and saying the legislature needs to vote on the token's creation.  Earlier this month, an alleged white paper for the coin was shared on social media, but the central government labeled it as false, saying that Maduro would announce the token's white paper at a later date.

At press time, the cryptocurrency's price is trading around $10,237.28, a decline of roughly 10.92% from the day's open of $11,522.86. As it stands, the current value is near the daily low of $10,050.79, and as of time of writing the price of bitcoin is down more than $1,200 for the day.  As seen in the graph, the price held above $11,000 until roughly 13:15 UTC, after which the price dropped below that level.  The developments call to mind those seen last week – though in this case, the price hasn't fallen below the $10,000 mark. As reported on Jan. 17, the price hit a low of $9,714.02 on the BPI.  Additional market data shows that other cryptocurrencies, including nearly all of the top-20 coins by total capitalization, are down amid the day's trade. Among the worst performers are IOTA, which is down more than 18% in the past 24 hours, and monero, which has fallen nearly 15% in the same period, according to CoinMarketCap.  Bitcoin's price neared the $13,000 level this weekend, climbing to as high as $12,956 during Saturday's trading session, BPI data shows.

42400877,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLLTg,1516657201,"SEC 'Looking Closely' at Public Company Blockchain Pivots, Says Chairman","The head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said today that the securities market regulator is ""looking closely"" at the trend of public companies that have announced new focuses on blockchain.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, a number of firms in recent months have made waves by announcing that they are shifting to blockchain business ventures, including a firm previously dedicated the sale of iced tea. And while those announcements have often sparked price increases, the trend itself has sparked warnings from both the agency as well as groups like FINRA as one potentially ripe for abuse by would-be fraudsters.  In statements issued earlier today during an event in Washington, D.C., SEC chairman Jay Clayton said that the agency is looking into the issue, honing in on the subject of investor disclosures specifically.  ""The SEC is looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology and whether the disclosures comply with the securities laws, particularly in the case of an offering,"" Clayton remarked.  He also said:  ""I doubt anyone in this audience thinks it would be acceptable for a public company with no meaningful track record in pursuing the commercialization of distributed ledger or blockchain technology to (1) start to dabble in blockchain activities, (2) change its name to something like ""Blockchain-R-Us,"" and (3) immediately offer securities, without providing adequate disclosure to Main Street investors about those changes and the risks involved.""  Earlier this month, for example, the SEC moved to halt trading of UBI Blockchain, a public firm that saw its price soar in the past year thanks to its crypto-oriented branding. Data from MarketWatch suggests that the stock remains frozen.  Taking lawyers to task  Elsewhere in his speech, Clayton also took aim at some of the lawyers providing advice to would-be ICO organizers.  ""First, and most disturbing to me, there are ICOs where the lawyers involved appear to be, on the one hand, assisting promoters in structuring offerings of products that have many of the key features of a securities offering, but call it an ""ICO,"" which sounds pretty close to an 'IPO,'"" said Clayton.  Nearly as problematic, according to Clayton, are lawyers that ""appear to provide the 'it depends' equivocal advice"" regarding the blockchain use case, regardless of whether the associated token bears similarities to a security under U.S. law.  ""With respect to these two scenarios, I have instructed the SEC staff to be on high alert for approaches to ICOs that may be contrary to the spirit of our securities laws and the professional obligations of the U.S. securities bar,"" he concluded.

Tina Bhatnagar will serve as vice president of operations and technology, according to a Monday announcement. In that role, Bhatnagar – who at Twitter was VP of operations and user services – will lead teams connected both Coinbase and GDAX, its digital asset exchange.  Prior to her role for Twitter, where she worked for five-and-a-half years, Bhatnagar served in executive positions at Salesforce and IBM, according to her LinkedIn profile.  ""It’s an exciting time, with Coinbase and crypto in the public eye more than ever before, but that also means it’s an even more critical moment to stake our position. And this can only happen if we do right by our customers every single day,"" Bhatnagar said in a statement.  That Coinbase would look to bring in some notable talent on the customer service side is perhaps unsurprising, given the platform issues the site has experienced amid a period of heightened trading activity around cryptocurrencies. The startup has faced criticism from some quarters of its user base about the issues.

In a Jan. 19 statement, the Ministry of Public Security disclosed its plan to crack down on pyramid scams, or financial schemes in which participants are encouraged to sell some kind of product while also soliciting others to create sales networks of their own. Some of the more well-known digital currency pyramid schemes include OneCoin, which as reported last week is the target of an international, multi-agency crackdown.  The ministry said in a translated statement:  ""The public security organs and industrial and commercial departments of the country will continue to carry out special rectification in key areas and...concentrate on destroying the pyramid selling organizational system, severely punishing the members of the pyramid selling field, annihilate and destroy the network pyramid selling and criminal activities, [and] earnestly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the general public as well as the economic and financial order.""  The statement doesn't make clear to what degree it will focus on schemes that claim to involve a cryptocurrency, versus pyramid schemes involving other types of products.  That said, the mention signals that officials will apply scrutiny to some of the schemes involved. In the past, scams such as Gemcoin have resulted in thousands of Chinese citizens being defrauded, and OneCoin has been known to have a presence in China as well.  It also remains to be seen whether China will move toward more forceful edicts, as shown in the case of the ICO ban last year. As reported by CoinDesk at the time, officials in China banned the blockchain funding model, deeming it to be an illegal form of fundraising.

Dubbed the Huobi Token (HT), the new issuance is set to start on Jan. 23 with a capped supply of 500 million. According to the announcement, 300 million HT (60 percent) will be issued to users over a course of 15 days, while reserving the remaining 40 percent for platform operation, team incentives and user rewards.  Huobi said the token launch ""is not an initial coin offering (ICO)."" Instead, the 300 million HT will be given to users who purchase a service fee package at a discount on Huobi Pro using tether (USDT) – a crypto token pegged to the U.S. dollar. Other cryptocurrencies that can also facilitate the purchase include bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, litecoin and ethereum classic.  While details of the packages are yet to be revealed, the company said there will be a maximum limit for each user's purchase and the minimal order will be 100 HT.  The news marks the latest move by Huobi to recover since the business was severely affected by China's clampdown on domestic exchanges, according to Leon Li, founder of Huobi Group. It has since shifted to an over-the-counter (OTC) trading model and targeted overseas markets.  ""We closed the trading book service on Sept. 15 and opened the crypto-to-crypto trading on Nov. 1 in 2017. The volume on Nov. 1 was about four to five percent of that on Sept. 15,"" Li said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""The impact was really significant.""  Essentially, through the new issuance, Huobi will be able to gather service fees upfront while increasing the level of user ""stickiness,"" Li said.  ""For example, if you purchase the 1,000 HT package, it will only cost USDT 990, and you will get 1,000 HT for free. HT can be used for offsetting the trading fees,"" the company said.  The ultimate goal, according to Li, is to make HT serve as an asset that connects users at Huobi's exchanges in Japan, South Korea and the U.S. in the future, as the company expands overseas.  While business registration in the U.S. is expected to take some time, Li added, the new ventures in Japan and South Korea are planned to open in March this year.  Meanwhile, HT will also be available for trading as the company's exchange platform will offer USDT, BTC or ETH trading pairs with the token. Addressing potential concerns over price volatility, Huobi will buy back HT based on its market price every quarter with 20 percent of its net profit during the same period.  Li said the funds bought back will be stored in an ethereum address as a reserve, dubbed the Huobi Investor Protection Fund, which will be made visible to the public.

42400887,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLLcX,1516626020,What a Facebook Blockchain Token Might Look Like,"Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.      Mark Zuckerberg, worth $71 billion at just 33, has done rather well by Facebook's centrally managed system.  Over the past decade and a half, the social media behemoth's closed-source algorithm has quietly manipulated its millions of users' news feeds to capture maximum ad dollars and steer them all to Zuck and his shareholders.  So, why is he exploring a more decentralized model? And what role might crypto technology play in that?  In a New Year's post to the platform, the Facebook CEO noted (with zero irony, it seems) that  ""With the rise of a small number of big tech companies … many people now believe technology only centralizes power rather than decentralizes it.""  And he vowed, on that basis, ""to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects"" of decentralizing, people-empowering technologies such as cryptocurrencies and encryption.  It was followed by another post telling users that upcoming changes to their news feeds meant they ""can expect to see more from your friends, family and groups"" and ""less public content like posts from businesses, brands, and media.""  It remains to be seen whether this bet in favor of ""meaningful social interactions"" over higher traffic content is, as Zuckerberg said, ""good for our community and our business over the long term."" The immediate reaction on Wall Street was harsh: Facebook’s shares fell 4.5 percent last Friday following the second post.  It was a predictable response: if Facebook will no longer curate new feeds to emphasize strong, ad-attracting content, then revenues, and returns to shareholders, will decline.  Threats to Facebook  So, why'd Zuck do it?  The prevailing wisdom is he wants Washington off his back.  The Russian political investigation has shone a light on how Facebook uses its proprietary, closed-source algorithm, the core instrument of its centralized power, to deliberately package ""like audiences"" for advertisers.  More important than allegations that Russian operatives used Facebook to spread disinformation and influence U.S. elections is the fact that Facebook has become so powerful a force that this kind of meddling is possible.  What's more, its algorithm effectively encourages it, if unwittingly: it naturally creates echo chambers of commonly minded people who will happily re-share and redistribute content they agree with, creating a sticky audience to sell to advertisers.  This happens even, or perhaps especially, when the stories they are sharing are demonstrably fake.  But Zuckerberg is clearly also bothered by rising disaffection among his users, a group to whom cyber security guru Bruce Schneier once offered this warning: ""Don't make the mistake of thinking you're Facebook's customer, you're not – you're the product.""  It took a while, but many now understand the bum deal they’re getting: they produce and distribute the content that drives traffic on the site, as well as delivering attention to advertisers, but aren't compensated one penny for it.  To make matters worse, they're forced to look at content they don’t want to see. (Who else is in the crypto community is sick of James Altucher's ""eccentric bitcoin expert"" ads in their Facebook feed?)  The problem is that under the current business model, the more Facebook decentralizes – either by being less interventionist in news feed curation or by following YouTube's lead and sharing ad revenue with traffic-driving users – shareholders will either get a smaller pie or a smaller piece of it, or both.  On the other hand, if user discontent leads to attrition or even an all-out exodus, it matters not that shareholders are protecting their margins – advertisers will leave, revenues will slide and, eventually, the platform could die.  The rise and fall of MySpace, the once ubiquitous platform that Facebook displaced, is a reminder that the latter's dominance is not guaranteed.  A token solution?  The resolution of this dilemma may lay with the very technology Zuckerberg has vowed to explore: a crypto-token, call it FBCoin.  To be clear, I have no inside knowledge on Facebook's plans. This is pure speculation. But, given the company's past forays, later abandoned, into digital money and payments, I think it's worth speculating on, especially with the context the CEO has laid out.  It also offers a window into how the center of gravity might move from tokens produced by decentralized app producers to those of established enterprises – for better or worse.  Here's an admittedly very rudimentary model: Facebook would pre-mine a large pool of tokens, distributing a significant number to shareholders and holding the rest in reserve to distribute to users based on some reliable metric of the traffic their original content generates. Facebook would then mandate that on-platform advertising must be paid for with those tokens. A market would then emerge, into which users could sell, giving them a way to monetize their content creation.  The value of the tokens would float against the dollar, based on demand and supply.  This, I believe, is how Facebook could best resolve its dilemma, giving both shareholders and users a valuable stake in the future growth of its platform under a more decentralized set of rules.  Of course, crypto folks accustomed to thinking of attack models will immediately see dangers here.  There are ways to game traffic data – something that Brave is trying solve with its browser and BAT token – and how does the algorithm know whether something is ""original"" and not just copied and pasted from someone else?  Ideas for reputation tokens  , proof-of-work models to disincentivize the creation of traffic-generating bot armies, and other skin-in-the game solutions will be needed to encourage honesty.  And who would run this? It's hard to imagine Facebook choosing not to control the market for its own tokens or to centrally run the ledger.  Yet if it wanted to truly unpack the expansive power of network effects, opening up the tokens to a true, decentralized blockchain system and, eventually, a decentralized market could result in far more explosive growth – and, by extension, token-based returns for Facebook’s shareholders.  If Zuckerberg really wants to experiment with decentralized systems, a publicly issued crypto-token would be hell of a way to do it.  Personally, I would much prefer someone else creates a scalable decentralized social media solution to replace Facebook’s insidious centralized algorithm – to do to it what Facebook did to Myspace. Social media badly needs a model that puts control back in the hands of people.  But who knows? Maybe Mark Zuckerberg, who has vowed to give virtually all his wealth away to charity, will recognize that perhaps the most powerful gift he can make to the world is a platform for creativity that empowers people by fairly rewarding their ideas and self expression.

42400893,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLLhS,1516623027,"Bitcoin Defends $11,000 Mark and Eyes Move Higher","Bitcoin is stuck in a narrow range currently, but a breakout may lie ahead, the price charts indicate.  Prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) rallied to a high of $13,000 on Saturday, but the spike was short-lived as prices fell back to $11,096 at 20:59 UTC yesterday.  As of writing, BPI stands at $11,700 – up 5.4 percent from yesterday's low. Still, the cryptocurrency is down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis, as per data source OnChainFX.  Interestingly, some in the investor community feel the U.S. government shutdown may have influenced the rise in BTC prices over the weekend. However, if history is any guide, BTC is unlikely to rally significantly on the political standoff in Washington.  For instance, during the last standoff (Oct. 1–17, 2013), BTC appreciated by 10 percent (not a huge move by BTC's standards), as data from CoinMarketCap shows. Further, prices were largely range-bound in the run-up to the deadlock and began rising sharply after it ended.  That possibility aside, the price chart analysis indicates scope for a rally to $15,000 and above – if the narrow range ($11,000 to $13,000) ends with an upside break.  4-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  BTC rallied to $12,500 as expected and extended gains to $13,000 over the weekend, yet failed to cut through the descending trendline resistance (marked by a circle).  The failure at the trendline hurdle and a drop to sub-$12,000 levels only add credence to the downward sloping (bearish bias) 50-MA, 100-MA and 200-MA.    Bitcoin chart    View  The bias is neutral as long as price remains stuck in the range of $11,000–$13,000. That said, risks are skewed to the upside, given the repeated rebound from near $11,000 levels.  Only a close below $11,004 following a rejection at $12,500 would open the doors for a deeper pullback to $8,000 levels.  On the other hand, a violation at $13,000 could yield rally to $15,733 levels (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $19,891.99 to $9,005).

As part of that shift, foreign nationals will no longer be able to deposit funds to their accounts.  The firm said:  ""If you are not a Korean citizen, the KRW deposit to the domestic virtual currency exchange will be stopped when you switch to the new KRW deposit method in January.

42380290,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MfoN,1516611646,Opera Browser Adds Cryptocurrency Miner Protection for Smartphones,"Cryptocurrency miners embedded in websites is increasingly becoming a problem for smartphones, but the Opera web browser is trying to remove the threat for its users.  Opera, which already introduced cryptocurrency miner protection in its desktop-based versions, is now putting the same feature into its smartphone browsers, the company announced Monday.  The new feature will be available on Opera Mini and Opera for Android, according to a press release, and is part of the browser's native ad-blocker function.  According to the press release:  ""The new anti-cryptocurrency mining feature is activated by default when you enable the ad blocker on Opera Mini (iOS and Android) or Opera for Android. The ad blocker can be enabled by going to 'settings', and it will automatically detect and stop the mining scripts written into the code of a webpage.""  Opera estimates that more than a billion devices worldwide are slowed down by website-based cryptocurrency miners that users do not realize are ""cryptojacking"" their browsers. On the other side of the browsing experience, the company believes there are now more than 3 million websites with embedded cryptocurrency miners.  Making it tricky for users to know there's a problem, there may be no visual cue that a miner is taking advantage of a web browser, according to the firm.  Cryptocurrency miners can overload smartphones' CPUs, forcing 100 percent usage and potentially causing a phone to overheat.  And the damage can sometimes be permanent. According to a ZDNet article, one trojan generated so much heat in a phone, its battery became swollen, permanently damaging the phone. While excessive ads were one reason for the heat generation, the main cause was that the phone's CPU was hijacked to mine for Monero.  The trojan was so effective, it ""wrecked the phone within 48 hours,"" according to the article.  Opera's new feature is already available, and the browser can be downloaded from the Google Play store, according to the release.

42380278,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MfY1,1516608014,"Don't HODL, BUIDL: How Blockchain Tech Will Add Value","Ajit Tripathi is an EMEA partner at Consensys Enterprise, and a former director of fintech and digital banking at PwC, where he co-founded its UK blockchain and smart contracts practice.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      I have come to trust Vitalik Buterin to ask the most important questions in blockchain.  The ethereum founder did that again last month when he asked in a tweet: ""Alright, the crypto market is now worth $525 billion, but how much of that valuation have we really earned?""  We can answer Vitalik's question by using the tried-and-true method of discounted cash flows.  This time isn't different  During the 1990s dot-com boom, valuation by counting eyeballs and various other body parts was rampant.  During the housing boom, valuation was whatever you wanted by tuning projects' default rates, prepayment rates, volatility and correlation.  During the current crypto boom, methods rooted in science fiction such as network-based valuation, technical analysis, Metcalfe's law and Moon-based valuation have all blossomed.  Unfortunately, whenver bubbles burst, discounted cash flows return with a vengeance.  So, while we all believe blockchain technology can solve all our problems including valuation problems, let's pretend this time is not different, and one day either everyone in crypto will have to generate fiat revenues and profits in some form.  The less likely that you will get the cash you think you will get in the future, the higher the discount rate. That is a big mess when you are dealing with anything except government bonds, which academic orthodoxy treats as risk-free (never mind the humongous national debt).  Asset pricing gets even worse when commodities and currencies are involved and we have to start watching costs and benefits of HODLing all your digital GODL or any ""implied interest rate"" you might earn on your GODL. That forecast of net benefit to the HODLer is basically your cash flow forecast.  So, as Vitalik pointed out – the crypto market is worth $525 billion but what did we do that is worth that in the future?  The question is what did we solve, enhance, or deliver that will make individuals, companies or governments produce more, be more efficient, or enjoy their lives and relationships more?  At a high level, we can ask:  1. What features (e.g. Truffle), products (e.g. UPort) or platforms (e.g. Digital Trade Chain) did we build that a consumer is using or benefiting from? No, I don't mean tether, Telegram chat channels, or proofs of concept.  2. Which enterprise solutions went live and how much new revenue or efficiencies did they create? This includes the work ConsenSys and IBM are doing in Dubai, trade finance platforms by IBM and R3, MUFGCoin and so on.  3. How much did we improve the infrastructure and stack by in terms of scalability, privacy, confidentiality and other such nice things? Quorum, zcash, Fabric, Corda, Coco – all count.  4. What original business models and technologies were created in 2017? ERC-20 tokens and CryptoKitties are included. Stablecoin crypto exchanges are excluded.  5. For each of these, what're the odds that we will see the invention used by a real person or enterprise over time? In the absence of any information, let's assume 50% for each.  Incremental value added in 2017  There is simply no way that we baked $500 billion worth of additional consumer value last year that we didn't have in 2016 – and all we had in 2016 was PoCs and a few promising ideas.  Any which way you make your list, there was just not enough useful kit in consumer or enterprise production last year.  Bitcoin scraped through to Segwit and all sorts of forks. A very large set of ethereum tools and solutions was released; Quroum, Corda, and Fabric became useful in the enterprise ecosystem, and a very small number of consortia got into technical production.  We bypassed VCs and made it possible for good, bad, and ugly blockchain startups alike to fund their runway.  So how much value did we add in 2017? When we calculate the consumer value of ERC tokens and CryptoKitties, and subtract the future disasters from future Amazons, we will probably get a smaller number than the $3 billion that was raised last year in ICOs.  Then we will thank Vitalik that all this money that could have gone into a largely useless coinware instead went into useful tech.  Why I bet on ethereum  Yes, there will be a lot more value created with blockchain in 2018 and even more the year after but there's so much future baked into the prices today – and it may need to be swapped around as we learn more.  I suspect that each year, half of the ICO-funded startups from the previous year will die – if they even make it that long.  Yet there will be the next Amazon or Google or Netflix in there. If you know how to pick them, go ahead. I don't.  This is why I am making a big bet of time on ethereum rather than a bet of money in crypto.  Ethereum has momentum, developer adoption, and a team that is willing to address the technical limitations even at risk to the price of ether.  It has people who are serious about the Web 3.0 vision and solving real consumer and business problems.  Does that mean $7, $70, or $700 billion is a fair value for ether? I can't say. Whether ether will go to the moon in 2025 depends on if ethereum is still the public blockchain in widespread use or if someone comes up with something much better, and if ethereum continues to evolve unlike some other crypto networks have.  Does that mean you should buy ether today? I can't and don't offer investment advice.  Should you start learning how to use ethereum to build solutions and decentralized businesses? Definitely – my son is learning how to build with ethereum and he is 14. He can do quite well just knowing how to build solutions for other people.  BUIDL, not HODL  When we are dead, it's not what we HODL or SODL that matters. It's what we BUIDL  So I advise everyone to think about that and BUIDL. Those who BUIDL do seem to enjoy it and look happier than the rest of us.  Besides, since BUIDLers don't have the time to day trade or buy dodgy coins, they are also a lot less likely to get REKT.

42380293,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mflr,1516597257,Opening Hyperledger: Consortium to Create Experimental Labs,"Hyperledger, the open-source business blockchain consortium, just got a little more open.  Founded in 2015 to help businesses more easily spin up enterprise blockchain solutions, the consortium approved a measure last week to create what it's calling Hyperledger Labs. As an effort to bring early-stage startups together with companies that are formally recognized by Hyperledger, the measure stands to accelerate the rate at which new ideas find traction and reach maturity.  ""This is a way to expand the Hyperledger community,"" said Chris Ferris, the chairman of Hyperledger's technical steering committee and chief technical officer of IBM Open Technology.  Companies were previously required to go through a grueling application process to prove the maturity of their code and a commitment of resources before becoming ""formally recognized"" by the consortium and obtaining ""incubation status"" for their code.  To give an idea of how rigorous the application process for that status is, there are at least 185 Hyperledger members, but only eight codebases have been formally granted the incubation status.  Of those eight codebases, only three frameworks have graduated to ""active status"" – Intel-contributed Sawtooth, IBM-contributed Fabric, and Iroha, contributed by Japanese startup Soramitsu, with support from Hitachi and several others.  But this new measure now gives startups access to some of the benefits that only those companies formally recognized – such as IBM, Intel and Monax – had access to.  Perhaps the most important being access to a separate GitHub code repository, where existing Hyperledger members and others can more easily identify the relationship to the consortium, examine the code being pushed to the repository, test it and provide feedback.  In a conversation with CoinDesk, Ferris explained why the labs were necessary in the first place, and in turn, why the measure was unanimously approved by the TSC.  He said:  ""We've had a couple of projects proposed for incubation [to] the TSC, and the TSC has declined the request, but not because the work was shoddy, but rather because we felt that the project wasn't ripe enough yet, hadn't matured to the point where we could really understand and see that there's a solid community behind it.""  Continuing, Ferris said the measure will be a way to engage those companies more closely, instead of turning them away.  Perks of participation  True, startups could already host a project on the general Hyperledger GitHub. ""But then it's sort of lost in all the other thousands and thousands and millions of projects,"" Ferris said.  Having the opportunity to get code directly in front of Hyperledger members is the key advantage to taking part in the initiative, according to Ferris. And with that increased visibility, Hyperledger members can provide valuable feedback that might possibly accelerate a startup's time to market, he continued.  The code submitted to the Github repository under Hyperledger Labs will not be required to meet any functional requirements, but the startup that pushed the code will also not receive intellectual property rights to identify as a ""Hyperledger Project,"" like those companies with incubation status have.  The code will also not receive legal and security checks before major releases and will not be supported by the official Hyperledger marketing campaign like those with incubation status. But the companies that pushed code will be shared on the Hyperledger.org website.  Overseeing the initiative will be a group of four ""Labs stewards"" from Hyperledger's TSC, who will give quarterly project reports to the broader community about participant progress, and kill projects that become dormant.  Bas Van Oostveen, a Lab steward and director of engineering at software firm Context Labs BV, told CoinDesk he hopes Hyperledger Labs ""will also provide a solid ground for smaller projects to find more contributors and guidance from the greater community.""  Expanding enterprise  In spite of the complex process for moving code into incubation, Hyperledger, a non-profit part of the Linux Foundation, has had a number of successes over the past year.  Of the several projects admitted for incubation status last year, it was the transition of others into active status that perhaps made the biggest impact.  In March, Hyperledger graduated Fabric, Sawtooth and Iroha to active status, setting the stage for the July launch of Fabric 1.0, deemed the consortium's first ""production-ready"" platform.  By the beginning of August, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and R3 had demoed a platform using Sawtooth, and Sawtooth Ethereum, or Seth, was revealed at the end of August with the aim of running ethereum smart contracts on Hyperledger Sawtooth.  The following month, an open-source version of Interledger, developed by Ripple, was submitted to Hyperledger, with the goal of streamlining any number of blockchain integrations.  Ferris said that's just a small taste of what's in store for Hyperledger in 2018. And if Hyperledger Labs does its jobs, the diversity of contributions will only increase.  He concluded:  ""There's at least three [projects] that have been brought forward and that we've reviewed and that didn't make it to incubation for various reasons. And so those are likely to be in the pipeline for being in the Hyperledger Labs.""
