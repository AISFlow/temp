42377476,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71UOd,1406834719,Bitcoin-to-Gold Service Faces Class Action Over Alleged Fraud,"Bitcoin-to-gold website Coinabul LLC is facing a serious federal class action alleging that it defrauded some of its clients.  The leading plaintiff is Yazan Hussein, who claims he transferred 1,644.54 BTC to Coinabul last year, but did not receive the gold he ordered.  The federal complaint was filed in Illinois on 25th July. It names Coinabul and its CEO Jason Shore as defendants. Hussein demands a jury trial.  Hussein turned to Edelson law for representation, the same firm heading the Mt. Gox class action in the US. Chris Dore, a partner at the firm, told CoinDesk that Hussein reached out to the company after trying to resolve the Coinabul dispute for close to a year.  Dore explains:  ""Once we were contacted by our client, we looked into it and this problem [is] widespread. There are countless complaints of people having the same experience where suddenly they stopped responding and stopped sending any product in exchange for the bitcoins. We did file it as a punitive class action and we do intend to pursue it as a class.""  Dore added that Edelson wishes to pursue the complaint as a civil matter to ensure that all bitcoins involved in unfulfilled transactions are returned.  ""The contracts that were entered into were simply not performed and [Coinabul] showed no ability or interest in performing those contracts,"" he said. ""What we want – and what we feel is best – is for all the bitcoins to be returned, and then everyone simply goes forward and that is the end of the case.""  Dore said Edelson has not been in touch with Coinabul yet.  No shipments since last June  The suit alleges that Coinabul stopped honouring its sales more than a year ago, back in June 2013. However, Coinabul continued to take orders and accept bitcoin payments for precious metals it did not have in stock, the plaintiffs claim.  The complaint describes the nature of the case as follows:  ""Defendants run an online marketplace called 'Coinabul' where consumers may exchange 'bitcoins' – a new form of digital currency – for physical denominations of silver or gold. Unfortunately, rather than delivering the metals promised to their customers, defendants chose to capitalize on the lack of effective regulatory oversight in this burgeoning industry, and instead defrauded their customers out of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins.""  The plaintiffs claim Coinabul stopped shipping the promised gold or silver and thus unlawfully misappropriated millions of dollars worth of customers' bitcoins.  Delays, excuses, more delays  The complaint states Coinabul unexpectedly stopped shipping precious metals to their customers approximately two years after it was founded in 2011. This caused a backlash, especially on bitcoin forums such as bitcointalk.org.  Coinabul responded to the controversy by taking part in online discussions and apologising for ""longer-than-usual delays"".  The company went on to issue additional ambiguous statements in an attempt to alleviate customer concern over the unfulfilled orders. Then, in July 2013, Coinabul sent an email to customers claiming that it was unable to find a bank willing to take its business.  However, in the email Shore claimed that a ""large portion of outstanding orders"" had already received tracking numbers and were en route to customers.  The complaint alleges the company never stopped accepting bitcoins for new orders, although it had no intention of fulfilling them.  Hussein's history with Coinabul  Hussein claims Coinabul still owes him 1,644.54 BTC. The unfulfilled orders were placed between 22nd-24th June last year.  Prior to these unfulfilled orders, Hussein spent approximately 1,400 BTC on gold coins and bars from the website. However, these shipments were fulfilled within several weeks.  Dore explained:  ""The long and the short of it is that he last year did some successful business with Coinabul where he transferred bitcoins and they gave him precious metals. He tried to do it again and transferred the bitcoins over and nothing came back. Time passed and time passed.""  After noticing that his last two orders were not fulfilled in a reasonable timeframe, Hussein began contacting Coinabul in July 2013.  Following an email exchange he decided to ask for his money back on 4th September. However, Coinabul informed Hussein that he was at ""the mercy of the banks"" and that the company could not fulfil any orders.  Over the next few months Hussein said he merely got vague excuses for why his orders were not shipped. Eventually he decided to take legal action.  Crucially, the complaint states that the exact number of class members is unknown to the plaintiff, but it points out that Coinabul received ""over a thousand"" orders. It is unclear how many of these remain unfulfilled.  ""We have been contacted by other people, so it's definitely not isolated,"" said Dore. ""I can't really say [how large the class is]. It's not gigantic, if I had to guess, I would say it's in the thousands.""

42377480,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71UTf,1406829913,Peter Todd Joins Viacoin Development Team as Chief Scientist,"Bitcoin Core developer and current Coinkite advisor Peter Todd has been hired by the Viacoin development team to work on a Bitcoin 2.0 technology concept.  Todd will serve as chief scientist and advisor on both the Viacoin core project and the decentralized smart contract platform ClearingHouse, which is being developed in tandem with Viacoin.  The primary focus of his work will be treechains, a concept created by Todd that allows for block chain scalability and side-chain coordination. Furthermore, treechains promote a greater degree of mining decentralization – a key issue facing the digital currency community today.  According to the official announcement, posted on the viacoin development bloghttp://blog.viacoin.org/2014/07/31/viacoin-hires-peter-todd.html, Todd’s work will allow for greater versatility and complexity of block-chain utilization – something that will enable the technology to be used on a larger scale in the broader economy. Tree Chains will ultimately be integrated into viacoin, serving as the basis of a broader build-out of its block chain and the protocols being developed for it.  Todd told CoinDesk:  ""My goals with treechains are permissionless development, decentralizing mining, and making bitcoin scale. I want to allow anyone with a new idea for a decentralized consensus system the chance to compete on a level playing field; treechains is that playing field.""  The growth of Bitcoin 2.0  As a developer, Todd is no stranger to either decentralized smart block-chain platforms or Bitcoin 2.0 projects. In addition to his work with Coinkite as chief naysayer and the Bitcoin Core project, Todd has been involved with the development of mastercoin, Counterparty and coloured coins. Notably, Todd resigned from the Mastercoin project following the announcement that he was working with the Viacoin team.  ClearingHouse, like Counterparty – a platform on which ClearingHouse is based – allows for the creation and deployment of a variety of smart contracts and actions. Todd’s treechains concept enables greater coordination and communication between block chains, a potential application that would make smart transactions simpler to conduct.  As such, the impact on digital currency development is significant. Viacoin told CoinDesk:  “Giving Peter the necessary resources to research and develop treechains will have a lasting impact on decentralised consensus-based systems. Mining centralization is an undisputed problem and if you extrapolate it to its logical conclusion, will spell the death of decentralised consensus.”",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/31/peter-todd-joins-viacoin-development-team-as-chief-scientist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec85eb36d0bb64ea0e04848d7745da79f1a29bf3-1273x508.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377494,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71UhV,1406826022,Mt. Gox and Ripple Founder Jed McCaleb Unveils Project 'Stellar',"Stellar, the long-secret digital currency project helmed by industry entrepreneur Jed McCaleb, has officially launched.  McCaleb is the original founder of defunct Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and a co-founder of digital currency-focused payment network Ripple Labs.  The new platform is a decentralized gateway for digital currency to fiat currency transfers, The Wall Street Journal reports. Like Ripple and bitcoin, Stellar will act as a public transaction authenticator and feature its own in-house digital currency called 'stellar'.  McCaleb's announcement follows months of rumors about the project, which first surfaced in February. At the time, a mysterious website was launched to enlist developers, alpha testers and designers, and now redirects to the official Stellar site.  In a statement, the Stellar Development Foundation's Executive Director Joyce Kim suggested that Stellar will act as a bridge between fiat and digital currencies – a key requirement if the latter are to be adopted by mainstream users.  Kim added:  “This is probably the best way to bring the best of both worlds together.""  Stellar details  According to WSJ, Stellar will act as a transaction gateway, enabling usability in both fiat and digital currencies.  While it's not clear what, if any, infrastructure is already in place, Stellar, like Ripple, will allow cross-border transactions that use digital currency as a technological 'middleman' for fiat transfers.  Notably, the platform's in-house currency, stellar, will be distributed to users for free. Supply is capped at 100 billion units, with roughly 95% of this amount being given away.  Stellar also sports a diverse leadership and advisory team. Noted board members include former Square Chief Operating Officer Keith Rabois and Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. Dogecoin co-founder Jackson Palmer and AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant will also serve as advisors for the project.  Break from Ripple continues  The launch of Stellar cuts McCaleb's remaining ties with the Ripple project.  In May, McCaleb announced his intention to sell his holdings of XRP, the native currency of the network. His statements, posted to the XRP Talk forum, caused a rapid XRP sell-off, with the value of the currency declining 40% following the news.  Despite his post, however, McCaleb has not yet sold the XRP, which he was awarded when he joined the company. When Ripple set aside 20 billion XRP for distribution amongst its founders, a 9 billion slice was awarded to McCaleb.  McCaleb was the original founder of OpenCoin, developing its protocol and later serving as its CEO. The company later changed its name to Ripple following the addition of current CEO Chris Larsen. In interviews, McCaleb described OpenCoin as an attempt to build a bitcoin network that did not rely on mining to process transactions.

42377478,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71UPt,1406819239,Coinbase Drops Bitcoin Processing Fees for Non-Profits,"In all the excitement yesterday over Wikipedia's new partnership with Coinbase, another significant piece of news from the bitcoin company got rather overshadowed.  Notably, the payment processor announced that it will waiver all fees for registered 501(c) non-profit organisations accepting bitcoin through its merchant tools.  On its blog, the company explained why the move is beneficial for charitable organisations to start accepting the digital currency:  ""The Internet has made it easier for non-profits to operate by enabling them to increase geographic reach and reduce the overhead required to fundraise. Adding bitcoin as a donation option is a natural next step for non-profits because it eliminates one of the most significant costs remaining – payment processing fees.""  The announcement continued that any non-profit accepting bitcoin through the company would be able to instantly exchange its bitcoin donations for US dollars and receive a daily bank transfer without incurring any costs.  Lower costs boost causes  At any charitable organisation overheads inevitably eat into donations, taking away much-needed funds from the intended recipients of the money. Charitynavigator.org even cites some highly-rated charities losing over three-quarters of their funds in this way.  The percentage of funds lost to expenses is an issue that charities themselves take seriously and one that can sometimes put people off giving.  Along with premises, staffing and other day-to-day essentials of running an organisation, donations will often incur fees from payment networks for their services. While PayPal offers a slightly lower rate for non-profits (2.2% + 30 cents per transaction, down from a standard charge of 2.9% + 30 cents), credit card tend to incur standard charges of around 1.5-3%.  Bitcoin, however, enables donors to give virtually 100% of their donation to the intended charity, with only a tiny fee going to miners.  Coinbase said that US donors may also enjoy significant tax deductions based on their bitcoin-denominated donations, although this may not be the case in every country.  Crypto-friendly charities  Apart from Wikipedia, most major non-profits do not yet accept bitcoin donations. However, some (such as UK charity Comic Relief) have said they are considering accepting the digital currency in the near future.  Furthermore, a number of smaller non-profits, including Sean's Outpost, the Women's Annex Foundation and some open-souce software organisations, already accept bitcoin alongside other cryptocurrencies.  In particular, the dogecoin community has proven very supportive of efforts to spread goodwill by donating to those in need, recently fundraising for a charity: water campaign to build much-needed wells in a drought-hit region of Kenya.

42377495,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71Uil,1406807831,BitFury Announces Hosted Mining Services for Business Customers,"One of bitcoin's biggest mining infrastructure providers, BitFury, has launched a new hosted mining service for business customers.  The company claims the scheme will provide customers with ""optimal and reliable"" – but low-cost – hash power to maximise the return on their investment.  BitFury says its ASICs and specialised mining hardware have established it as the market leader in both constructing and managing computing centres for mining operations. According to the company, approximately 40% of all bitcoins are mined using BitFury-made chips.  DigitalBTC  and CryptX became the first clients to use BitFury's managed mining services, which are not available to all customers.  From Georgia with love  The firm says its computing centres are managed around the clock by a team of engineers and benefit from locations with low energy prices.  BitFury secured $20m in funding  earlier this year, investing much of this capital into expanding already extensive mining operations in Finland, Georgia and Iceland. The company says it constructed a new 20MW data centre in Georgia in just 30 days.  Valery Vavilov, CEO of BitFury said in a release:  “Mining has become more than just hardware, and we are excited to offer managed services to enable customers to benefit from our specially designed data centres and cheap energy prices from clean energy sources.”  CryptX and DigitalBTC pleased with performance  CryptX and DigitalBTC, the two clients trialling BitFury's managed mining services, say they are pleased with the performance so far.  Last week DigitalBTC, the first bitcoin-centric company to trade on a major mainstream stock exchange, reported its quarterly earnings. The figures revealed that the company has already managed to recoup its original $4m investment in BitFury-branded miners and services.  “We’ve found the BitFury Group to be an invaluable partner as we have built up DigitalBTC into a significant bitcoin miner and the world’s first listed bitcoin company alongside our other bitcoin operations,"" said Zhenya Tsvetnenko, the company's executive chairman.  ""We’ve trusted the BitFury Group to help us support and manage millions of dollars in capital investment, and they have more than repaid that trust.""  Bert Valkenborgs, CEO of cloud mining firm CryptX, commented that professional hosted mining operations are likely to be the future of the mining market.  BitFury is not the first company to offer comprehensive hosted mining services. Cloud mining started taking off last year and UK firm CloudHashing led the way, offering bitcoin mining-as-a-service in mid-2013. CloudHashing eventually merged with HighBitcoin to form PeerNova, which now sells mining infrastructure services at an enterprise level.  Bitcoin ASIC designer CoinTerra announced several hosted mining services back in May, starting at $999 for a 12-month 200GH/s rental. The company said the move will allow it to deploy orders more rapidly than its competitors, making the most of its hardware.

42377497,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71UlH,1406779996,Bitstars.ph 'Selfie' Contests Reward Winners with Bitcoin,"Philippines-based website Bitstars.ph has developed a novel way to get bitcoins into thousands of new hands, and demonstrate the network's utility for micropayments and tipping, with a worldwide 'selfie' competition.  The site  , which launched in alpha mode on 1st June, already has over 1,100 registered users who have submitted over 10,000 photos. Of themselves.  A 'selfie', in case you hadn't heard, is a photographic self portrait – often taken specifically to be uploaded to a social network. Upload them to Bitstars.ph as well and you have the chance to earn bitcoin tips in addition to all those 'likes'.  Miguel Cuneta, Co-founder and CCO of Bitstars.ph's parent company Satoshi Citadel Industries (SCI), told CoinDesk the project has a dual purpose. He said:  ""The main concept was to find a way to monetize 'likes' using bitcoin and make people get to know about the concept of bitcoin using a familiar medium – social media.""  How it works  The site has a daily competition for the most popular selfies, with popularity being gauged by the number of 'likes' an image receives.  Prizes depend on the number of user submissions over the course of a day, and range from about 200 pesos ($5) to 500 pesos ($12), which Cuneta said was around the median daily wage for a Philippines-based 9-5 worker. The winnings are paid out in bitcoin, of course.  Additionally, winners can opt to donate their prize money to a charity or their choice.  Further encouraging bitcoin use, members of the site can also leave small tips in the digital currency for pictures that grab their attention, which average around 8 mBTC each.  To encourage active participation, users may now also earn small amounts of bitcoin by liking and voting as well.  Bitstars.ph is open to anyone in the world with an Instagram or Facebook account, with users able to log in using those credentials.  Topping the 'most popular' lists are selfies which are funny, creative, silly, colorful, and adventurous. No particular theme or style dominates the winner lists – of course, being attractive always helps but it's no guarantee of success.  The 'selfiest' city in the world  It's not surprising Bitstars.ph was born in the Philippines – locals simply love taking selfies. Makati City, part of the greater Metro Manila area, was recently ranked number one in TIME Magazine's 'Selfiest Cities in the World’ analysis. Manhattan and Miami were second and third respectively. Cebu City, also in Philippines, came in in ninth place.  The analysis was based on the number of times the #selfie tag was applied to over 400,000 photos uploaded to Instagram.  The Philippines population is now around 100 million, with 40% having Internet access, and one in four owning a smartphone. Facebook gets more eyeball-hours than TV in the country with 30 million active users.  Cuneta said:  ""Filipinos are very social people. We use social networking to communicate with friends, get news about everyday events, news about our loved ones here and abroad (geographically, the Philippines is spread out over many islands, and globally, 10% of the population work abroad), and as a way to connect professionally and recreationally.""  Mission to promote bitcoin awareness, usage  Parent company Satoshi Citadel Industries calls itself a ""provider of bitcoin solutions"" and manages a range of different digital currency services and sites.  It also manages merchant services site Bitmarket, in-beta exchange Coinage, and remittance service ReBit. SCI is also rolling out pre-loaded bitcoin cards as another fast way to get bitcoin into newcomers' wallets.  Cuneta explained that local awareness and adoption of bitcoin remained SCI's main focus for now. Given that the Philippines is probably the world's largest social media market, it seemed natural to integrate bitcoin somehow.  ""By making bitcoin accessible in fun and familiar way, we also eliminate that barrier of bitcoin being perceived as too techy or complicated for the average user. Bitstars.ph is our innovative take on the concept of a bitcoin faucet. It's fun, it's easy, it's simple, and you can win some money while doing something you would normally do for free.""  Cuneta said he hoped as the concept became more popular, users could earn good money from their photos, a concept that could then expand to cover music, art, and other media.
