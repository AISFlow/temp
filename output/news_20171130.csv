42380073,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LyHp,1512082826,Fed Vice Chair: Cryptocurrencies Threaten Financial Stability,"Digital currencies may pose a threat to financial stability as they gain popularity, said U.S. Federal Reserve vice chairman for supervision Randal Quarles.  Speaking at the 2017 Financial Stability and Fintech Conference on Thursday, Quarles warned against the rise of cryptocurrencies, saying private decentralized currencies could have ""spillover effects"" on the broader financial system if they grow too big.  Their volatility, and the fact that they are not backed by any institution or physical assets, make them difficult to get a handle on, which means it is unclear what would happen in an emergency situation, he said.  During his speech, he said:  ""Risk management can act as a mitigant, but if the central asset in a payment system cannot be predictably redeemed for the U.S. dollar at a stable exchange rate in times of adversity, the resulting price risk and potential liquidity and credit risk pose a large challenge for the system.""  While Quarles warned against digital currencies, he explained that the note of caution reflected a lack of understanding as to how they would react to times of adversity, saying ""it is not clear … whether the payment system would be able to function, in times of stress.""  Fedcoin? Go slow  He also suggested ""extensive reviews and consultations"" before any central bank issues its own homegrown cryptocurrency, especially in nations where cash is prominently used.  Rolling out such currencies too quickly could also spook residents and lead to a drop in economic activity, Quarles warned. And deployment of ""unproven technology"" could potentially cause other issues.  While Quarles is wary of using cryptocurrencies as any sort of federal monetary system, he does support the idea of using digital currencies as ""secure limited-purpose"" tools for settlement processes.  He recommended further research into cryptocurrencies to establish use cases.

42380069,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LyFJ,1512075627,ICE Agent: Cryptocurrencies Increasingly Used in Money Laundering,"Criminal organizations are increasingly using cryptocurrencies to launder money or otherwise pay for illicit activities, according to one U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.  Child exploiters, drug smugglers, illegal firearm sellers and intellectual property rights violators are all beginning to use cryptocurrencies for their transactions, said Matthew Allen, ICE's special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).  Allen testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on modernizing anti-money-laundering laws to limit both laundering and terrorist financing on Nov. 28, explaining that virtual currencies are the newest major method for hiding criminal proceeds.  In his testimony, he said:  ""HSI agents are increasingly encountering virtual currency, including more recent, anonymity enhancing cryptocurrencies (AECs), in the course of their investigations. AECs are designed to better obfuscate transaction information and are increasingly preferred by [transnational criminal organizations].""  Some exchanges are beginning to design services specifically to thwart tracking by use of mixers that anonymize virtual currency addresses, making it even more difficult to determine which user conducted a particular transaction, Allen said.  Drug arrests  The department has had some success in identifying criminals who use bitcoin, however. Allen pointed to the November 2016 arrest of Utah resident Aaron Shamo, who allegedly ran a Xanax and fentanyl manufacturer group.  Shamo allegedly took his profits in bitcoin, and HSI seized approximately $2.5 million from him at the time.  Another alleged fentanyl vendor, Pennsylvanian Henry Koffie, was arrested this past July and had $154,000 seized. Allen said Koffie sold nearly 8,000 orders of the drug, “most of it paid for with bitcoin.”  Lady Justice image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/11/30/ice-agent-cryptocurrencies-increasingly-used-in-money-laundering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/954004f8efaac81f26da3b00eb78a3b864eeee63-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42380064,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Ly5F,1512072012,"Almost Half of ICO Funding Goes to Europe, Report Finds","Startups in Europe raised more capital through initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the last three years than any other region on the planet, according to a study released Thursday.  More than a third of all ICOs – 40% – are based in the European Union (EU), according to the analysis by venture capital firm Atomico. These 446 transactions raised $1.76 billion, nearly half (46%) of the worldwide total from token sales. The second biggest region for this activity was North America, with 244 campaigns raising $1.076 billion.  The report, entitled “The State of European Tech,” cited data collected by Token Data, a startup that tracks ICOs, as well as Atomico's own survey of investors and startup founders.  What's more, the EU might become the global leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain development over the next five years, according to the report. An increasing number of startups on the continent focus exclusively on blockchain development, accounting for a much higher share of companies founded in 2016 than in 2012.  Sprawling teams  Notably, the report found that roughly 25% of ICOs had some sort of decentralized team, where the company launching a campaign was headquartered in a different location than the founder or chief executive.  Ricky Tan of Token Data said he expects this figure to increase in the coming years.  In the report, he said:  “We see a pattern of geographical diversity between ICO founding teams and also within the teams themselves. If the future of business ideas lies in decentralisation, then decentralised founding teams will be a key aspect of it.”  Europe also has the greatest number of bitcoin nodes, with more than 5,000, according to the Atomico report. The U.S. comes in second with just over 3,300 nodes.  While the number of ICOs and blockchain startups is increasing, interest in ""blockchain"" in general is increasing even more rapidly.  Data from Stack Overflow cited by Atomico shows an exponential growth in the number of searches for the term, jumping from 110 in January 2015 to 14,500 in September 2017.

As first reported by Reuters, John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, offered his thoughts about the developments in distributed ledger technology and what its progress means for central banks.  Speaking at the 54th annual Economic Forecast Luncheon in Phoenix, Williams took a question from the crowd about what he thinks bitcoin's rise means for the economy, as shown in this Periscope videohttps://www.pscp.tv/w/1yNGaVAYmAWJj from the San Francisco Fed's account.  He answered by first pointing to the underlying blockchain technology's potential to improve the efficiency and security of payments, but then said:  ""The other thing I think is interesting is this question of central bank-issued digital currency. Right now, the Federal Reserve is not developing its own digital currency, but there is a lot of research going on around the world thinking about this question.""  Williams told the crowd that his remarks should not be construed as a suggestion of what the Fed might or might not do, but he does think government-backed cryptocurrency will remain a hot topic among central banks.  ""I think this will be a very exciting area over the next decade,"" he said.  'Very premature'  This follows similarly tentative comments yesterday by Williams' counterpart at the New York Fed, William Dudley.  ""I think at this point it’s really very premature to be talking about the Federal Reserve offering digital currencies, but it is something we are starting to think about,"" Dudley said at a quarterly public engagement event in New Brunswick, New Jersey, according to Bloomberg.  But economists at the Fed have been keeping an eye on this space since long before the recent run-up in bitcoin's price and media attention.  In a 2015 conversation with CoinDesk, David Andolfatto, a vice president of the St. Louis Fed, argued that bitcoin and the Fed are not really that different, saying that the central bank is in a sense open-source and all money is just a ledger of one form or another.

Speaking this morning, Mersch said:  ""Banks need to implement instant payments as soon as possible and provide an alternative narrative to the ongoing public debate on the alleged innovation brought by virtual currency schemes.""  Mersch reportedly added that the ECB would experiment with cash ""on different digital technologies,"" while more ""adventurous applications"" do not warrant attention.  The statements come a month after another ECB executive board member, Benoît Cœuré, indicated that the bank is not ignoring cryptocurrencies, but rather is monitoring their use.  At the same time, Cœuré maintained the bank's long-held position that digital currencies are not a threat to the euro, saying ""the amounts involved are marginal.""  Despite these claims, a 2015 report by the ECB noted that cryptocurrencies could impact monetary policy and financial stability in the Eurozone. At the time, the bank said bitcoin was more attractive than traditional financial institutions in certain areas, including remittances.  The ECB's president, Mario Draghi, also recently said it cannot regulate bitcoin, although he did declare that EU member nations cannot launch their own cryptocurrencies.

Following a lengthy legal battle between the two entities, the San-Francisco district court ruled Tuesday that Coinbase must hand over user accounts at the exchange that bought, sold, sent or received sums of $20,000 and higher between 2013 and 2015.  Coinbase must now provide the tax agency with the name, address, taxpayer identification numbers and date of birth of customers associated with these accounts, a court filing states.  The dispute over user records has been ongoing since November 2016, with the IRS proposing a reduced summons in July this year – down from an initial 480,000 customer accounts requested.  Back in July, Coinbase argued that the scope of the reduced summons remained too wide, labelling it a ""fishing expedition.""  As a result, some of the data required has also been reduced from the initial order, which included information such as wallet addresses and public keys.  In a blog post on the ruling, Coinbase claimed a ""partial victory"" in having this scope reduced.  Legal research and advocacy group Coin Centre has spoken out against the ruling, saying it is ""deeply unsatisfied with the lack of justification provided by the IRS"" and that the case ""sets a bad precedent for financial privacy.""  As previously detailed by CoinDesk, the investigation in concerned with locating cases of tax avoidance on transactions involving cryptocurrencies.  In the blog post, Coinbase stated it is in the process of reviewing the order, and assured users:  ""In the event that we ultimately produce the documents under this Court order, we intend to notify impacted users in advance of any disclosure.""

As per CoinMarketCap, the world's fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at roughly $685 – down 9.3 percent on the day – after rising to an all-time high of $826.95 at 09:59 UTC.  Also notable is that trading volumes have hit a record high of $4.84 billion, suggesting the rally might be here to stay.  A look at the individual markets shows that the rally is being fueled by Korean desks. Trading volume in DASH/KRW pair offered by Bithumb, one of the largest exchanges in South Korea, has gone up 30 percent in the last 24 hours.  One reason may be the asset's positioning in the news, with groups associated with the protocol announcing earlier this week they would partner to help solve Zimbabwe's economic crisis.  But whatever the reason, price chart analysis also favors further upside, albeit after a healthy technical correction to $600 levels.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows:  A bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence.  50-MA, 100-MA, and 200-MA are sloping upwards and positioned one below the other in favor of the bulls.  The rising trendline (blue line) could offer support at $583 levels.  Daily chart  On the chart above:  5-MA and 10-MA are curled upwards in favor of the bulls.  The RSI is overbought.  Two consecutive candles with higher shadows (big gap between the close and intra-day high) indicate bull market exhaustion.  Prices are struggling to hold gains above $696 (161.8% Fib extension).  View  Dash could drop to $600-$580 levels, courtesy of the bull market exhaustion on the daily chart and the bearish price RSI divergence on the 4-hour chart.  The base appears to have shifted higher to $600 levels – i.e. dips below $600-$580 could be short-lived as indicated by a pattern of higher lows (rising trend line on the 4-hour chart) and upward sloping moving averages.

42380068,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LyBX,1512046804,"Regulation, Taxation Loom Over Crypto Investors","The legacy of the W.J. Howey Company lives on, though not in a way the owners of the Florida citrus grove would have likely envisioned.  Seven decades after its legal battles with the SEC, the company has been enshrined with near legendary status in the cryptocurrency space, as the investment contract test every initial coin offering token is being judged by.  ""Many of us lawyers studied this Howey case when we were in law school, and we couldn’t have, in our wildest dreams, imagined going into a room like this where it could be recited like it’s the Pledge of Allegiance,"" joked Lewis Cohen, a partner with Hogan Lovells, during a legal panel Tuesday at Consensus: Invest in New York.  As the world of cryptocurrencies and ICOs continues to race ahead, the lingering questions the test elicits in the ICO community about how these tokens will fit within existing legal and regulatory frameworks remains the elephant in the room.  Perhaps the most pressing question is whether there is a distinction to be made between tokens that function as securities and those that have a broader utility for a future platform.  In that regard, the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) framework, which sought to advance the dialogue of what a two-tiered token sale that separates the primary and secondary markets might look like, has received a good deal of optimism.  But yesterday at the conference, multiple speakers poured cold water on the concept and suggested a return to the drawing board.  Matthew Roszak, co-founder and chairman of blockchain startup Bloq, said:  ""I’m not a huge fan of [SAFT]. I think trying to hermetically seal that pre-ICO financing is not as democratized and open as you’d like it to be.""  'Too many hands'  But regulatory uncertainties in the space extend well beyond the SEC.  Numerous agencies at the federal level are still determining their approaches toward these new assets, and with additional state authorities likely to get in on the action, jurisdictional complications could make the space even more confusing, argued Gary DeWaal, special counsel with Katten Muchin Rosenman LP.  DeWaal explained:  ""Too many hands in the pot are never a good thing for the development of an asset class.""  Especially since many regulators are under inaccurate impressions about tokenized assets, according to Lee Schneider, a partner at Will McDermott & Emery.  He noted that many are making the mistake of juxtaposing the existence of liquidity with whether or not the underlying asset meets the definition of a commodity or a security.  ""The nature of the token is hugely important here. You can’t divorce the regulation of the thing from what it is just because you’ve digitized it,"" he said, adding that he's been pushing back against these misperceptions.  Taxation is … coming  Another legal gray area within the cryptocurrency space relates to taxation, and with the price of bitcoin eclipsing $10,000 per coin Tuesday, the IRS will be paying greater attention in the coming year.  ""If you hold large positions and you’ve been moving in and out of a lot of these tokens and coins, the IRS is probably going to start digging into this stuff,"" said Kelsey Lemaster, a partner specializing in taxation at Goodwin Procter.  And the advent of ICOs only complicates matters further, as the IRS has not issued guidance there, but according to Lemaster, investing in an ICO token is most likely a taxable event.  ""I’m sure it’s not reported in 99 percent of transactions, but I’m sure that’s what the IRS would say,"" he contends.  But the taxation issue could become more manageable as a slew of cryptocurrency-focused tax software products, including a new app rolled out by Libra, are beginning to hit the market.  Such products, which look to bring automated tools to traders instead of them having to manually input data into Excel spreadsheets, better enable traders acting in good faith to comply with IRS requirements, and could springboard cryptocurrency activity.  On why tax tools are so important, Jeremy Drane, chief commercial officer at Libra, said:  ""At some point in time, you reach a level of complexity in your operations where you can’t scale.""

Further, the price action analysis suggests an increased risk of a deeper pullback in the short-run.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows:  High volume bearish doji reversal  Falling tops or lower highs pattern  The relative strength index favors the bears (below 50.00)  Strong support at $9,132 (confluence of 50-MA and rising trend line).  A doji candlestick forms when asset's open and close are virtually equal. A bearish doji reversal occurs when the doji candle is followed by a big red candle, as seen on the above chart, and indicates a bullish-to-bearish trend change.  Adding credence to the bearish scenario is that volumes have shot up during the price drop over the last 24 hours. A high volume drop could be an indication that bulls are losing control.  View  The doors look open for a drop to $9,000. A close below $9,202 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) could yield a sell-off to $7,793 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement). However, the 10-day MA (seen today at $9,000) is still sloping upwards, thus losses below the same are likely to be short-lived.  Also, a weak close today would confirm a bearish doji reversal on the daily chart. It would indicate a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  Bullish scenario: Consolidation above the $10,000 mark for a next couple of days would improve the odds of bitcoin moving to fresh record highs.

42400746,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKTpD,1512039621,Blockstack Counterattacked a Phishing Attempt on Its ICO,"When criminals tried to con investors during its recent initial coin offering (ICO), Blockstack, a startup building a decentralized internet, used its tech expertise to turn the tables on the tricksters.  Scammers hoping to lure investors feeling left out because the firm limited its token sale to accredited investors only set up phishing sites by copying the entire blockstack.com code.  But doing so meant the fake sites were actually in contact with a server that Blockstack controlled, which fed the top banner of the legitimate site with tweets from the company's Twitter account.  And that connection allowed the Blockstack team to undermine the phishing sites with what was effectively their own man-in-the-middle counterattack.  In a man-in-the-middle attack such as this, data is changed on a trusted website by someone who manages to insert themselves between a visitor and a publisher. For example, someone can create a Wi-Fi hotspot that changes a webpage before it reaches your browser.  Blockstack developers, though, used the attack for good, putting themselves in-between their own twitter feed and the scam websites. The team's simple solution used the backdoor into the banner to warn those who potentially could have lost funds that the sites were not legitimate (see below).  ""The server was fetching tweets from Twitter and formatting them for the blockstack.com website,"" Blockstack co-founder Muneeb Ali explained to CoinDesk in an email. ""For all requests for data not coming from blockstack.com, we displayed the 'THIS IS A PHISHING SITE' message instead of the tweet text.""  The Blockstack team provided CoinDesk with two different URLs used by the phishing scheme, which, for security reasons, we are not disclosing in this article.  ""We had a couple of phishing sites that came online, where they were trying to direct traffic to them,"" Ryan Shea, also a co-founder, told CoinDesk, adding the company took extra precautions:  ""We made it very clear to only trust blockstack.com. So we primed everyone ahead of time.""  One of the most widely anticipated token sales of 2017, the Blockstack ICO was an attractive one for scammers to try and exploit, since hype can make links to their fraudulent sites shared on social media blend into the ""noise"" (much like fraudsters solicit donations to fake charities in the wake of natural disasters).  Blockstack's token sale is nearly closed. Still, one of the two phishing sites remains active with a redesigned front page (eliminating the tweet stream banner) and offering a 10 percent discount on ... absolutely nothing.  We probably don't need to say this, but, buyers beware.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstack.

42400737,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKTgM,1512032430,"More Devs, More Destruction: Another Zcash Crypto Ceremony Is Underway","Blockchain coder Cody Burns wakes up in a coffin-sized hotel room in what he would later call a ""questionable"" part of Hong Kong.  As the hotel cashier doesn't speak English (and only accepts in-person paper-based check-ins), Burns believes this hotel is ""not something a westerner would stay in,"" but that's all part of his plan to keep his tracks covered.  You see, Burns is performing the cryptographic ceremony that privacy-oriented cryptocurrency zcash has become known for: a ritual that involves multiple people around the world destroy the so-called ""toxic waste"" that zcash's ""trusted setup"" creates.  Burns turns off his phone and cuts off all internet connections to his laptop (so no one can track him), then boards the buzzing Hong Kong metro, where no one will suspect him of performing the sacrament – running a secret program given to him by the zcash development team.  He's brought along two USB sticks, one shaped like SpongeBob and the other like Pikachu – technology now doubling as toys – which he used to install the operating system and a zcash virtual machine. Also with him is a colorful Rubix Cube he picked up at a local market as a key to pull random words from the famous sci-fi novel ""Neuromancer.""  Fittingly, perhaps, as the scenario he's created could just as easily be written in the pages of a William Gibson novel.  At the time, 20 people, including Burns, are moving through similarly strange (if not dystopian) scenarios, displaying not only just how difficult it is to keep things secure and private online, but also how far crypto enthusiasts are willing to go to make sure their next-generation money is.  ""It was about two hours in the train running wonky crypto computing software, under one of the most densely populated cities in the world, during rush hour,"" Burns, who writes blockchain code for Accenture during the day, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It was a true cypherpunk way to end the trip. 10/10. Would do again.""  Behind the curtain  Even with many of the best-known cryptocurrency communities poring over possible code improvements in an effort to offer users more privacy, zcash's ceremony – this one named ""Powers of Tau"" – is perhaps the most unique.  But while the process may seem over-the-top to outsiders, zcash's cutting edge zk-snarks cryptography, which shields transactions senders, receivers and balances, makes the routine necessary.  For this particular hard fork upgrade, it'll have to go through a new trusted setup, and if someone is able to compromise the ""randomness"" input into the system by developers, they'll theoretically be able to exploit the system, possibly printing themselves as much zcash (currently valued at $316 per token) as they've ever dreamed of.  At least one participant must successfully destroy the cryptographic toxic waste, or the whole system could be vulnerable.  In this way, many think last year's ceremony didn't go far enough since it only included six developers – a small enough number that some criticized the inherent trust needed in that group to not collude or be compromised in some way.  But this time around, for its first hard fork upgrade (meant to pave the way for a faster network), hundreds or thousands of people participated, though they needed the technical prowess to run the code in a secure environment.  As University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign assistant professor and zcash advisor Andrew Miller explained in the ceremony announcement:  ""As the number of participants grows, it becomes implausible that all of them could be compromised.""  The new proof  This process is playing out openly on the zcash mailing list, with those participating writing ""attestations"" describing what technical safety measures they took. While some are more or less extravagant, they're all performing their own versions of what Burns did.  As another example, ethereum developer Hudson Jameson and his friend used a crude ""Faraday cage"" made out of a cardboard box covered in tinfoil to shield the computer used from attackers who might try to figure out what the computer was computing by beaming radio signals toward it (stealing information in this way is more common than it sounds).  Then, going one step further, (Burns merely ran a program to destroy the software within his USB sticks), they demolished the RAM, computer and USB sticks with a drill and hammer, because destroying the physical computer helps destroy any traces of the program that could be lingering on the hardware.  ""It seemed like it would be a lot of fun; it was,"" Jameson told CoinDesk. But he feels that it's useful too.  ""I feel confident using these public parameters that will be generated because I destroyed the secret randomness used in my part of the ceremony,"" he said. ""I don't need to trust that other people in the ceremony were honest or not being spied on because of my personal participation.""  All this might seem paranoid, and to a certain extent, it is. But it also goes to show just how difficult it has become to secure online systems – from both rogue hackers or omnipotent dictators – where much of humanity now spends much of its time.  For my part in the process, I tried to use lava lamps (it's predicted as much as 10 percent of the Internet is encrypted using the randomly moving blobs within the lights). However, I didn't have enough time to write a program that would harness their randomness, so I just glanced at the lamp from time to time, hoping it would make my typing more random.  Probably not the most random, but we've got Jameson's destruction to fall back on (should you trust him).  Vulnerabilities still?  Others don't.  Despite the complex, distributed precautions many developers are taking to secure zcash, some worry the ceremony could go awry anyway.  ""It is an improvement, but it doesn't address the issues with a trusted setup,"" said OkTurtles founder Greg Slepak, who has been one of the most vocal critics of zcash's creation mechanism.  Even though many more developers are participating this time around, he argues there still could be problems. For one, all computers using Intel Management Engine, a chip that's in millions of computers, could be compromised in the same way.  Plus, participants might not be as careful as they think they are.  ""Every single person participating in this ceremony is being watched. If any sane person were to participate in this ceremony, they would do it anonymously,"" he contends.  Instead, he said, other cryptocurrency projects, such as Monero (which is live) and MimbleWimble (which is forthcoming), offer similar levels of anonymity without an initial trusted setup that however small, could ruin zcash's primary appeal.  ""I'm glad that they're trying to improve upon it; I'm just against the very concept of a ceremony,"" Slepak said.  But while Slepak has his worries, the new ceremony has changed the minds of other skeptics.  ""I was not a fan of the original 'closed, but trust us' process, but I understand its intent,"" Burns said, adding:  ""The second [ceremony] is much more resilient and scalable.""

At least that's according to Lord Michael Bates, a minister of state, who addressed the question in a written response to a question from a member of Parliament, Lord Jonathan Harris.  Lord Bates wrote:  ""HM Revenue and Customs does not offer digital currencies as a payment method and has no current plans to do so.""  Profits made on speculation in cryptocurrency ""are currently chargeable at the normal Capital Gains Tax rates, depending on the facts of the case,"" Bates wrote in response to a separate question from Lord Harris.  Those gains could be considerable. Bitcoin alone has made a 10x return since the end of last year, including briefly crossing the psychological threshold of $10,000 this week. At press time, bitcoin is trading at £6,992.34.  Lord Harris asked several other questions concerning cryptocurrency regulation.  In response to another, Lord Bates said that the government plans to bring wallet providers and exchanges under anti-money-laundering rules, pending amendments to a European Union directive. Negotiations over those amendments should wrap up by early next year, he told Lord Harris.  ""This will require such firms to conduct due diligence upon their customers, with their activities being overseen by national competent authorities for these areas,"" Bates wrote.  And in answering Lord Harris' question about U.K. banks' reluctance to provide accounts to digital currency firms and their employees – a problem faced by startups in the space for years – Bates offered little encouragement.

42400725,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKTXV,1512007242,Just 400%? Willy Woo's Math for Insane Crypto Returns,"Willy Woo sounds like a high stakes altcoin gambler.  He's often looking for insane 100x to even 1,000x gains, and he's willing to stomach the kind of volatility that could wipe out three-quarters of his portfolio's value over a couple of weeks.  And while everyday investors might be bewildered by those concepts, it's not too surprising for Woo, given his background.  While now best known for his innovative philosophies on cryptocurrency, Woo got his start in the trading world buying derivatives during the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis — he started shorting bank stocks right before the banks collapsed. And that experience gave Woo a pretty solid understanding of how to trade markets when they're at their most volatile.  Plus, with a background coding as a teenager, it's no wonder Woo was drawn to cryptocurrency.  It was right around the time bitcoin hit the $1 billion mark that Woo got interested in crypto, shortly after moving to Bali, where, as he describes it, he ""went down the rabbit hole.""  While his first foray – much like other investors just getting in – was bitcoin, he's since changed his tune, deciding the real action is in altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies).  ""My particular portfolio is very, very high gain, high risk. It's highly volatile,"" said Woo.  Data explorer  But, even still, he's got a pile of data to back up those risks as the right decision.  ""Under the data that I have is that most coins when they launch that are successful, they create a particular graph,"" he said, pointing to the Falcon 9 rocket launches as a visual. ""The photos show the rocket launching up with this steep trajectory and then it levels off and continues moving steadily up.""  Although, looking for those breakouts comes with some gnarly lows, too.  But to Woo, ""We're not trading here. We're investing. We're going to put it in a drawer like a venture capitalist does.""  For him, investing in cryptocurrency isn't about short-term trading gains, but about longer-term investments. Because of this, Woo primarily focuses his attention on the ""early launch"" of cryptocurrencies, where the trajectories are steepest, hoping to get the 10x to 100x trajectory that some of the best coins have had during their initial run.  Woo believes that chasing those kinds of returns will be far more lucrative in the long run than the ""boring"" 300 percent to 400 percent annualized returns that bitcoin is now generating.  And then, once the coins mature – typically rising to the range of around half a billion dollars – that's when he starts looking to exit.  But even without that investment thesis, Woo has data that shows considerable returns even if you're just investing blindly in all altcoins.  Woo told CoinDesk:  ""Even if you weren't filtering the shit out of and buying everything under the sun when they launched – all 700 or so coins – even the scam coins, actually it's near a 50/50 split where 50 percent was underperforming bitcoin, but around 50 percent was outperforming bitcoin.""  Math behind the madness  But it's the data behind Woo's investments that would make most crypto investors salivate, as his strategy takes inspiration from an even deeper set of calculations than just market cap.  For instance, Woo is a serious consumer of blockchain explorers like Blockchain.info, using stats like mempool, connection rate, trade volume and miner income to judge the health of a network.  With that in front of him, he then visualizes the data and looks for patterns to emerge.  Woo typically works in metaphors and analogies, looking for ways to compare the cryptocurrency to other things. For instance, he might ask himself: if bitcoin fulfills a similar role to PayPal – facilitating digital payments – what are the metrics one can use to measure bitcoin's potential?  Woo has been searching for a key benchmark ratio for cryptocurrency for some time, one that will provide the same kind of insight that the price to earnings ratio (P/E) provides for equities. While an investor can analyze the market capitalization of a coin as the price, the key second component, the earnings, isn't available in the cryptocurrency space.  The next closest proxy, according to Woo, is sales – or, in the case of PayPal or bitcoin, the total value of the transactions that ride on their networks.  ""I treated that as the closest thing we've got to a price to earnings [ratio],"" Woo said.  By using that kind of P/E, he continued:  ""You can just start to look at it to see if it's valid. Does the valuation track the transaction going through it? Once you understand that data, you can look to see where it's pumped and where it's dumped in the past.""  While that's a good starting point, Woo doesn't stop there – not when there are other data points that can be mixed and matched, creating new ratios and new data metrics, looking for the golden ticket that will allow him to predict with more certainty how to invest.  ""I'm just trying weird stuff, here's some data here, what if I messed with it in this way?"" he said.  Rails over train cars  All that data crunching has left Woo focused primarily on cryptocurrencies as protocols.  According to Woo, nearly all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are protocols or the decentralized infrastructure that decentralized applications can be built on top of.  ""For the first time, we can invest in these protocol stacks and any app that's built on them, you get a [kind of] cut,"" said Woo, adding:  ""You can buy the real estate in which people plant down their businesses.""  And with that thinking, Woo doesn't worry much about investing in applications. In his mind, the applications that ride on blockchain protocols are starting to look more and more like Silicon Valley startups – where nearly 10,000 launch per year and only a handful succeed, with only one becoming a unicorn like Facebook.  That, he thinks, is a much more speculative play, than investing in the base-layer protocol cryptocurrencies.  This risk also keeps Woo away from most initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well, a not often heard strategy in today's crypto space. But instead of long-term investments, Woo sees most application specific tokens as merely ""FOMO-nomic"" (playing off the acronym ""fear of missing out"") hype.  Plus, as more and more token sales offer privileged buy deals, those investments become even higher risk and even more work.  So for Woo, it's all about the long-term ""HODLing"" pattern with tokens that provide the rails for application train cars.  And sure it takes some initial due diligence – Woo advocates researching the founders and advisers to see whether any big names are willing to put their reputation on the line for the project, as well as spending time in related social channels and forums.  But in the end, Woo's philosophy after buying is simpler.  He concluded:  ""Once you've done your due diligence, you pretty much sit on it for six months to two years and ride out the bumps.""

The first question one should ask themselves is, is this price justified?Surely a pull back may be due in the near term. At these prices the market cap of Bitcoin is now around $183 Billion. This is a fraction of the market cap of gold, a fraction of the market cap of stocks and a very small fraction of the market cap of major currencies.So is Bitcoin truly a financial asset or is it more like my childhood baseball cards?First let's explore, is Bitcoin a currency?The fact that it can be used for purchases on Overstock, square pay and via wallet to wallet transfers for goods and services. It would seem that it is on its way to becoming the 1st major currency to compete with the US dollar, Swiss franc, Euro, Pound and the Yen.Based on the market cap of major currencies, if Bitcoin was to become a true major, it has a long way to go before hitting the wall. Bitcoin is approximately 30th in the largest currencies in the world.Now is Bitcoin the new Gold?Hard to say if Bitcoin has become the new age digital gold. If it is in fact, Bitcoin still has a way to go to reach the 7.8T market cap of gold that is stated by the world council.Are crypto currencies the Generation Y version of equities?Is Bitcoin the Generation Y version of stocks buy and hold? They refer to it as buy and HODL. Hold On For Dear Life! Bitcoin is nowhere near the total market cap of the s&p 500, but to be more fair let's compare it to some tech stocks.Bitcoin is approx one fifth the size of Apple.So if Bitcoin as a technology is more revolutionary than Apple, maybe a trillion dollar market cap makes sense?ConclusionThis may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost—thus lowering the risk to buyers. If this is tulip mania 2.0 we have a long way to run for one Bitcoin to equal 10x the salary of a skilled technology engineer.DisclaimerThis article is for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice.DisclosureThe author may hold Bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/bitcoin-tulip-mania-digital-age,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15990444.jpeg
