31448883,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631153,1721779116,"Cosmos (ATOM) Set For 50% Rally After Recent Plunge, Analyst Eyes $12 Target","The market for cryptocurrencies is humming with hope because the recent climb of Bitcoin and the launch of Ethereum ETFs today is seen to create a positive wave. In this bustling environment, Cosmos (ATOM) is one cryptocurrency that shows great potential for a big break-through. Related Reading: Chainlink Inches Closer To $18 Despite Bearish Pressure ‚Äì Analyst Although ATOM has stayed somewhat steady, with a little rise of 1.23% over the previous week and a drop of 4% over the last 30 days, experts feel it is about ready for a significant climb. ATOM‚Äôs market position is notable at its current value of $6.23, with a market value of $2.50 billion and a 24-hour trade volume of $235 million. Despite a 0.54% retreat over the last 24 hours, the market seems to be in a good mood right now, making it a good time for ATOM to make money. Technical Patterns Signal Breakout Prominent bitcoin guru Jonathan Carter has highlighted Cosmos‚Äôs intriguing technological configuration. On its daily chart, he notes that ATOM is negotiating a declining wedge pattern, sometimes interpreted as positive. #ATOM Cosmos is trading inside a falling wedge pattern on daily chartüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Price currently near a descending resistance and preparing for breakoutüìà Potential targets after breakout could be $7.25, 8.85 and $12.15üéØ pic.twitter.com/P3n0O3pXBA ‚Äî Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) July 21, 2024 This trend points to ATOM developing momentum and breaking out from its declining resistance line, a crucial place where selling pressure has traditionally been strong. Should ATOM be able to overcome this barrier, a significant upward trend might be started. Carter has set four important ATOM price targets: $7.25 as the initial objective, followed by $8.85, and maybe as high as $12.15 should the optimistic trend hold. For those that position themselves ahead of the breakthrough, these goals reflect substantial profits. Forecasts And Indicators Boost Optimism Several technical indications point to this positive view. A possible breakout is being established by rising trade volumes and optimistic divergent momentum indicator (Relative Strength Index) deviations. Traders track these indications attentively and, once the resistance level is breached, they are prone to start a buying frenzy. Data from Coincheckup shows that over the next seven days, ATOM is predicted to show an advance, thereby implying good momentum in the near future. ATOM‚Äôs recent performance shows a minor undervaluation, which suggests a possible buying opportunity for investors as it is now trading around 1.50% below its expected value for the next month. Looking ahead, the six-month ATOM growth estimate is a strong 58%; the one-year prognosis shows an amazing 108% increase. This long-term projection emphasizes faith in ATOM‚Äôs stability in the market and possibility for significant increases. Related Reading: ‚ÄòEarly Signs Of Breakout‚Äô ‚Äì Solana To Explode By 900%, According To Analyst The Spotlight On Cosmos Cosmos (ATOM) is becoming a standout performance as the bitcoin community rides the wave of strength and excitedly awaits the effect of Ethereum ETFs. Cosmos is primed to gain attention in the altcoin market as it has the ability to transcend its present pricing levels and generate notable increases. ATOM is one to keep special attention to as traders and investors search the market for interesting prospects. For Cosmos, the next several weeks might be crucial as they will allow for a breakout that drives it to unprecedented heights.

This bullish sentiment has continued to propel the price forward with $70,000 remaining the major target from here. According to one analyst, this recovery signals an entrance into the final wave, which is Wave 5, that could send the BTC price back toward its ATH price. Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Hit $72,000 In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Arthur Signals shared an interesting analysis of the Bitcoin price, saying that the cryptocurrency has entered the final Wave 5. The analysis goes through the BTC performance in the month of July, identifying the start of Wave 1 when the price first surged from its lows below $54,000. Related Reading: Polygon Network Active Addresses Just Hit A New Yearly High, But Why Is MATIC Price Down? Moving forward, Wave 2 happened with the crash back down from $60,000 to $56,000. Wave 3 followed right after with an increase above $65,000, while Wave 4 was the decline to $63,000 that was recorded over the weekend. The current leaves only Wave 5, which is usually the most bullish of all the waves. With this final wave, the crypto analyst expects the price of Bitcoin to eventually break above $70,000 and rise toward its current all-time high of $73,000. However, for the BTC price to properly complete this move, it has to break the $68,275 peak that was recorded on Sunday. From here, the Bitcoin price would need to create a new peak to confirm the breakout, which has a $72,000 target from the crypto analyst. World Events That Could Send The BTC Price Flying While the wave formations on the Bitcoin chart paint a bullish picture for the price, there are also other developments that are bullish for the price, and one of those is the US presidential elections. On Sunday, incumbent president Joe Biden announced that he was stepping down from the race, giving his support to Vice President Kamala Harris to run on the Democratic ticket. Related Reading: Solana Leads Crypto Rally As Expectations For A Break Above $200 Grow This development has so far been bullish as the market now expects a victory for Donald Trump, who has been openly vocal about his support for cryptocurrencies. ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs announcement, after some unexpected volatility, has given Bitcoin bullish momentum as the market strengthens its confidence in a Republican election victory,‚Äù Arthur Signals pointed out in the post. If Trump does emerge victorious in the election, which is scheduled to be held in November, it will be a positive development for crypto. Trump has declared support for Bitcoin, hinting at using it for treasure purposes. This, in addition to rumors that Trump is considering BlackRock CEO Larry Fink as Treasury Secretary, has sparked bullish expectations for Bitcoin this year.

Gox Bitcoin exchange have finally begun receiving their owed Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin cash (BCH) via the Kraken and Bitstamp crypto exchanges. However, this had a notable impact on the cryptocurrency market, contributing to a nearly 4% drop in the price of Bitcoin after users confirmed the deposits to their wallets from the exchanges. Mt. Gox Distributes Millions To Bitstamp And Kraken On an early Tuesday morning, wallet addresses linked to Mt. Gox initiated the transfer of $2.85 billion worth of BTC. According to on-chain data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham, Mt. Gox executed the movement of $2.85 billion in BTC to new wallets with the primary purpose of distributing 5,110 BTC, equivalent to $340.1 million, to four distinct Bitstamp addresses. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Witness Stellar Start As Trading Soars; Analyst Sees ETH‚Äôs Price Reaching $8,000 In Q4 Bitstamp is one of the five exchanges that collaborate with the Mt. Gox Trustee to facilitate the return of funds to the exchange‚Äôs creditors, including Kraken and Japanese exchanges Bitbank and SBI VC Trade. Notably, Mt. Gox still retains possession of 85,234 BTC, valued at approximately $5.70 billion. While some users within the Reddit community have confirmed the receipt of Bitcoin returned by Mt. Gox through Kraken, Bitstamp users have reported not yet receiving their allocations. Kraken had previously announced the successful reception of creditor funds from the Mt. Gox trustee amounting to over $3 billion or 48,641BTC, estimating a timeframe of 7-14 days for the complete deposit of funds into user accounts. Critical Support Zones For Bitcoin In the aftermath of the Mt. Gox payouts, market data analysis platform CryptoQuant has spotted the price correction that BTC has experienced over the past few hours, with the company noting that it has impacted the line of 1-3 month BTC holders. CryptoQuant emphasizes the importance of monitoring support levels, specifically highlighting the $63,600 area, representing the average purchase price of 3-6 month bitcoin holders. Crypto analyst Caleb Franzen, on the other hand, has observed Bitcoin returning to a familiar support zone, which has proven effective. Despite the temporary setback, Franzen contends that Bitcoin has displayed a pattern of higher highs and higher lows in the short term, indicating resilience amidst the current price volatility.

Delving into on-chain data, Martinez underscores a crucial support zone for Bitcoin between $63,440 and $65,470. Within this range, approximately 1.89 million addresses collectively purchased 1.23 million BTC, highlighting the significance of this zone as a key area to monitor in the coming days.

In comparison, the bitcoin ETFs had $4.5 billion in trading volume on their first day, and $600 million in net flow.  Investors traded over $1 billion worth of shares of the freshly launched ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers on the first day of their availability, data from Bloomberg shows.  Of this $1 billion, there was a net inflow of $106.7 million, according to a tracker from SoSoValue. Most of the outflow came from Grayscale's Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which saw $484 million in outflow.  The spot bitcoin ETFs, for example, saw $4.5 billion in trading volume on launch day but only roughly $600 million of that represented inflows.

BlackRock's BUIDL fund pitched for a $34 million allocation, while Steakhouse Financial applied with a lending vault on Morpho Blue.  Ethena's governance token ENA gained 22% following the news.  Ethena, the protocol behind the $3.4 billion yield-generating ""synthetic dollar"" token USDe, is planning to invest a part of its reserves in tokenized real-world assets (RWA), and BlackRock's BUIDL fund is among the first applicants to throw its hat in the ring.  The protocol laid out plans in a July 16 governance post to allocate a part of its $235 million USDT holdings, roughly 7% of collateral assets, and its $45 million surplus buffer called the Reserve Fund to RWA products to earn a yield. Ethena's token provides yield to investors by buying spot bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} and parallely selling, or shorting, perpetual swaps of the assets on crypto exchanges, harvesting the funding rate.  BlackRock's BUIDL, a money market fund represented by an Ethereum-based token, seeks a $34 million allocation from Ethena's $45 million Reserve Fund, according to a Monday post by Jonathan Espinosa from tokenization platform Securitize, BUIDL's distribution partner.  Steakhouse Financial also applied for a Reserve Fund allocation on Monday with a USDC lending vault on DeFi platform Morpho Blue, which is overcollateralized by wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), wrapped staked ether (wstETH) and Backed's tokenized Treasury Bills product (bIB01).  Mountain Protocol, issuer of the USDM yield-bearing stablecoin, also signaled interest in applying, with founder Michael Carrica replying last week to the governance post that the protocol ""will be presenting a proposal in the coming days.""  All prospective applicants will need to post their proposal publicly on the governance forum, Guy Young, founder of Ethena Labs, the developer company behind the protocol, said in an email.  Ethena's governance token ENA rallied 22% following the news, outperforming the broad-market crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index's 1% gain during the same period.  Ethena's open competition is the latest example of tokenized RWAs getting increasingly used in the crypto-native, decentralized finance (DeFi) world. Most recently, DeFi lender MakerDAO announced plans to invest $1 billion of backing assets of the DAI stablecoin in tokenized Treasury products, while ArbitrumDAO, an ecosystem development organization of Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum, finalized a similar contest to allocate the equivalent of 35 million of ARB tokens in tokenized offerings.

31442506,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631109,1721768412,Chainlink (LINK) Forms Signal That Last Led To 123% Rally,"On-chain data shows Chainlink has just seen a level of decline in its exchange reserve that last led to a massive rally for the cryptocurrency. Chainlink Exchange Supply Has Dropped By 1.6% In The Past Month According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Chainlink has observed significant outflows from exchanges recently. The indicator of interest here is ‚ÄúSupply on Exchanges,‚Äù which, as its name suggests, keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating LINK supply that‚Äôs currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Last Resistance: Bitcoin Now Testing Final Short-Term Holder Cost Basis When the value of this metric rises, it means these platforms are receiving a net amount of deposits right now. As one of the main reasons why investors may transfer to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, such a trend can have bearish implications for the asset. On the other hand, the indicator registering a decline implies a net outflow of coins is occurring from the exchanges.¬†Holders generally withdraw their coins to¬†self-custody when they plan to hold into the long term, so this kind of trend can be bullish for the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Chainlink Supply on Exchanges over the past year or so: As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink Supply on Exchanges has witnessed a sharp drawdown recently. More specifically, investors have withdrawn around 1.6% of the asset‚Äôs entire supply in circulation over the past month. This is a very notable decrease and suggests there is some strong demand from the whales for accumulation. The last time the metric saw a significant drop was in the early part of the year. This last decrease of 1.1% led to a LINK price rally of around 10%. In December, a similar trend was observed, with withdrawals equivalent to 0.7% of the supply resulting in a 26% jump in the coin. Both of these instances, though, saw outflows of a smaller degree than what LINK has seen recently. From the chart, it‚Äôs visible that the last time a similar percentage of supply exited these platforms was between 15th of September and 14th of October. What followed this withdrawal spree was a massive 123% surge in the Chainlink price over the next four weeks. As a similar decline has occurred again in the indicator with the exchange supply dropping from 23% to 21.4%, it‚Äôs possible that LINK could end up seeing a bullish effect this time as well.

42417624,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZHwL,1721768262,Coinbase Narrows Demand for SEC Chair Gensler's Crypto Messages,"Crypto exchange Coinbase filed a motion to compel the Securities and Exchange Commission to produce internal communications on its discussions about crypto, including the messages of Chair Gary Gensler.  The company backed off from a more aggressive earlier effort to seek Gensler's communications, having demanded documents from before he started work at the agency.  Coinbase Inc. (COIN) is going after internal chatter at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that may shed light on its pursuit of cryptocurrency exchanges as illegal enterprises ‚Äì including Chair Gary Gensler's own communications ‚Äì but the scope of its latest request filed on Tuesday has been dialed back after resistance from a federal judge.  The company heard the message from Judge Katherine Polk Failla, of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, that she thought Coinbase was going too far in its demands for years of communications from the SEC chief that included messages before he showed up to run that agency. Coinbase Chief Legal Office Paul Grewal said its Tuesday motion is responding to the judge's points from a hearing earlier this month, but it still seeks the chairman's correspondence on crypto, any discussions within the various divisions of the SEC and what the agency officials may have talked about before approving Coinbase as a public company.  ""What we're asking for here, ultimately, is transparency into how the SEC has gone about its business,"" Grewal said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""We think government transparency, by and large, is a good thing. When you're sued by that government in a case they chose to bring, we think it's even more important that we have full line of sight into documents that could bear on our case.""  The regulator will have a chance to respond by next month, though Tuesday's motion claims the SEC ""refuses to search any document outside of a self-selected group of Enforcement Division investigatory files"" and won't ask Gensler ""whether he used his personal email for communications about his public statements on these subjects.""  The SEC's enforcement action against Coinbase accused the company of offering unregistered securities and running an unregistered exchange. The company denies that the tokens being traded were securities and that its exchange falls under SEC rules, though it also argues the regulator has made a mess of outlining industry standards. Coinbase has also sued the SEC on the latter point, and the resolution of all the exchange's legal disputes could be central to resolving U.S. crypto policy.  Gensler's personal view on crypto is central to Coinbase's argument that the agency has been inconsistent with how it's tried to direct the industry to comply with securities laws, Grewal said. But when the company sought to subpoena Gensler's private communications, the judge said Coinbase was acting inappropriately.  Jorge Tenreiro, an SEC senior trial attorney, argued at a July 11 hearing that Gensler's communications before he became chair were not relevant to the case.

Gox Creditors Receive Assets on Kraken,"Cryptocurrencies slid Tuesday as Kraken started to distribute assets to creditors of defunct exchange Mt. Gox, with the potential sell pressure weighing on the market.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} tumbled to $65,500, down nearly 4% over the past 24 hours, while bitcoin cash {{BCH}} plummeted more than 7% over the same period.  The broad-market crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index declined 3%, with altcoin majors solana {{SOL}}, Ripple's XRP {{XRP}} and Cardano's ADA {{ADA}} down 4%-5%.  Ether {{ETH}} outperformed most assets, trading mostly flat below $3,500, supported by the U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) booking strong trading volumes on their debut day.  The price action happened as multiple creditors reported to receive their cryptos after ten years of waiting from the estate of Mt. Gox, a one-time crypto exchange giant that imploded in 2014 after a hack. The estate started this month to transfer assets to several crypto exchanges, where users will be able to reclaim assets over the next weeks.  The imminent distribution of nearly $9 billion worth of BTC and BCH has been a top source of concern for digital asset investors, pondering how much of those assets creditors will sell on the open market to capitalize on the massive price appreciation over the past ten years.  Crypto prices often reacted negatively to news about Mt. Gox-related blockchain transfers recently. Earlier today, bitcoin slipped to near $66,000 after Mt.

42417633,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZI4b,1721763289,Spot Ether ETFs See $600M in Volume In First Half Day of Trading,"The eight recently launched spot ethereum {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posted nearly $600 million worth of volume in the first half of their first day of availability, according to data from Bloomberg.  The race is led by Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum Trust (ETHE) which had seen $250 million of its shares traded by 12:30 pm ET. BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) is in second place with roughly $130 million.  Fidelity‚Äôs Ethereum Fund had roughly $77 million in volume while Bitwise‚Äôs Ethereum ETF had seen $66 million.  ‚ÄúWe assume $ETHE volume is mostly outflows,‚Äù Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote in a post on X. Grayscale's ETHE, in similar fashion to its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), entered the race with over $9 billion in assets, thus giving rise to the idea that much of its volume is due to outflows.  On the lower end of the volume spectrum were Invesco and 21Shares, whose ether ETFs after four hours of trading had not yet hit the $10 million mark.  If volume continues at this pace, the newly launched ETFs are on track to reach roughly $940 million on the first day of trading, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart. This would be a little over 20% of the volume that the spot bitcoin ETFs saw on the first day.  Lower funding rates could stifle institutional interest  Analysts have been predicting demand for the ether ETFs will be at most 20% of that of the bitcoin ETFs for several reasons, which include lack of name recognition and the inability to stake the cryptocurrency when buying shares of the funds.  Another factor could be ether‚Äôs low funding rate, according to 10x Research founder Markus Thielen, who says that bitcoin‚Äôs funding rate when the ETFs launched in January was near 15% and increased to 70% in February.  ‚ÄúThis brought in many institutional arbitrage funds, which bought the ETFs and shorted the futures against them to pocket the spread,‚Äù he wrote Tuesday. ‚ÄúAs we pointed out, their buying drove the bullish sentiment in a self-reinforcing process.‚Äù  Ethereum‚Äôs current funding rate, said Thielen, is significantly lower at 7% to 9%, which could be too low for institutions to consider using the funds for an arbitrage investment, especially given that interest rates are currently at 5%.  ‚ÄúContrary to the strong Bitcoin Spot ETF flows in February, Ether ETF flows will likely not attract those arbitrage flows instrumental in driving positive sentiment,‚Äù Thielen wrote.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/23/spot-ether-etfs-see-600m-in-volume-in-first-half-day-of-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cfb6c4b619631cafc4c77a0ecd6cb0c7b6583ab3-7952x4473.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: ‚ÄòEarly Signs Of Breakout‚Äô ‚Äì Solana To Explode By 900%, According To Analyst The move was supported by an increase in activity within the Immutable network itself, with more than enough game announcements since last week. Hype aside, Immutable is currently solidifying its position within the crypto gaming industry. Major News For The Crypto Gaming Industry Immutable‚Äôs platform for the crypto gaming industry has been proven effective. With an active roster of over 200+, its growth continues to attract more developers to build games on Immutable. Immortal Rising 2 was recently announced that it will be released on Immutable, bringing more attention to the platform with Planetarium Labs CEO and Founder JC Kim stating in a recent interview he‚Äôs ‚Äúexcited to join forces with Immutable‚Äù which will help them deliver ‚Äúcutting-edge gaming experiences,‚Äù for users. ‚ÄúWe are excited to join forces with Immutable to build Immortal Rising 2. This partnership marks a significant milestone in our mission to deliver cutting-edge gaming experiences,‚Äù Planetarium Labs CEO and Founder JC Kim said in a recent interview. This move came after Immortal Rising 2‚Äôs success in South Korea and the global gaming market, with over 2 million downloads and a $24 million revenue. Onboarding a hotshot of a game on Immutable will bring more than enough capital to improve its systems. Immortal Rising will hold a second closed beta test with an evaluation occurring today, July 23rd, for the CBT applicants. Another bombshell for Immutable is from a recent blog post that was released today. According to their metrics, over 380+ games are currently in development on Immutable‚Äôs platform. They also boasted the platform‚Äôs zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machine (zkEVM) is one of the fastest growing chains ‚Äúin history‚Äù with over 2.2 million active users. This is a strong indicator that industry-wise, Immutable has a trustworthy platform for developers to use, thus giving investors and traders confidence that IMX is a worthwhile investment. Will Your Portfolio Be Evergreen? IMX‚Äôs current position is somewhat unstable and safe at the same time. The $1.458 support level has held since the later part of June, but the $1.706 resistance has also held its ground against the bulls. If the bulls have a chance of getting through $1.706, any major market action done by the top cryptocurrencies could influence the price whether for the better or for worse.

42417631,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZI1V,1721762621,"Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary on Crypto Investing, Ether ETFs and Gary Gensler","Kevin O 'Leary, chairman of O'Leary Ventures and ""Mr. Wonderful"" on ""Shark Tank,"" spoke with CoinDesk's Jennifer Sanasie. The following is a lightly edited transcript of their interview.  Jennifer Sanasie: Alright, I gotta talk about that background. It just looks so lovely. What? Where? Are you sitting by a pool right now?  Kevin O'Leary: It's right behind me, it's the Hamptons. I thought it would celebrate a summertime moment. It's a great summer we're having, in particular with crypto policy, so why not enjoy?  JS: Exactly. I am completely with you. Well, honestly, it sounds like you've been having a really fun summer. I saw you on stage on Twitter with the Jeff Tuohy band on X just living life, Kevin.  KO: Yeah, I do that every year with Jeff‚Äôs band, keeps my chops up. He gets better and better. And of course we celebrate that. I do a lunch every July 5 with Jamie, who started Ring, a very famous Shark Tank deal that got away. He sold it to Amazon for $1.2 billion. We've become very close friends. We got our families together and then we went to Cisco Brewery and then I jam on stage. It's a great time. It's just a celebration of the 4th.  JS: I'm so happy you brought up Ring because I got to ask you about some of your best and worst investments. Did you invest in Ring?  KO: No, I was the only shark to make him an offer. I thought there'd be a lot of dilution and consequent rounds over and over again. I offered him $600,000 in debt with 2.5% warrants ‚Äì non-dilutive warrants. He didn't take that offer. I understand why, but at least he got one. It would have been the biggest outcome in Shark Tank history, but you can't win them all.  JS: It would have been a good one. When you think back, not only to Shark Tank history, but to your career, what's the worst investment you've ever made?  KO: Well, I've made a lot of bad investments, but I've gotten better from experience and I've learned something interesting. I guess I would call it intuition over time. When you're writing a check and making an investment and it doesn't feel right in your stomach, that's because it isn't and it's going to go to zero and it does. And I've done that to myself a few times, but now I listen to my innergut on this, which I think is just years of experience. And if it doesn't feel right, I don't do it. And it's, I've been very fortunate, you know, I don't get it right all the time, but I get it right enough that it's, it's been an interesting ride. And it's really your winners that define your success. And I will say one thing about investing to everybody, cause I've been doing this a long time. Let's say I do 10 deals. I'll do, I'll probably do 17 deals. The ones I think are gonna be the winners are never the winners. It's the ones that I think, ""that's a flyer,"" that five years later I get 100X, 200X, 300X on. You just don't know, which is why you need that diversification in your strategy. You need to do more than one, particularly if you're talking about venture capital. That's what we're talking about here. I don't just do venture, I do private equity, I do debt, I do other things. But on the venture portfolio, it's high risk and you need diversification.  JS: I think that the lesson that you just outlined there also applies to the crypto market, very high risk, a lot of projects launching every day. It's really hard to kind of decide and also do due diligence on a lot of the projects that are launching a lot of the coins and the tokens that are coming to market. Would you say that that advice could apply to people who are investing in crypto?  KO: I would also add liquidity to it because when you start to scale, you ask yourself, look, if I'm going to be putting millions of dollars into a crypto asset, can I get millions of dollars out? And, there's very few tokens that are liquid enough for let's say, a $20, $30, $40 million investment, which is where you get to when you start to grow a large portfolio. So for me, my largest positions are obviously in ETH and bitcoin.  And I don't hold them in ETFs. I've never understood why anybody would do that. You're paying fees where you don't have to, but I prove that they've been made that way because it makes it a lot more accessible to individual investors. So it's great that it happened, but I don't use them. I use exchanges. I'm far more concerned about the exchange that I'm on. Is it compliant? Is it liquid? Can I get transparency on pricing? How secure is it? What domain is it in?  You know, obviously, I do a lot of work in the UAE. So M2 is important to me. I own a big piece of WunderFi in Canada. I love the compliance they've got up there around 60 plus tokens. They're the largest there. They've got 1 .7 million accounts and now they're expanding into Australia. So I really like the idea of being able to work with my asset on an exchange with total transparency and compliance integrated into my financial reporting platforms.  JS: We were just talking about the Hamptons and you on stage with Jeff Toohey and his band. I'm not sure that a lot of people get to actually walk up to you at events like this or when you're out in public, but when they do, if they do, what kind of advice are they asking from you about their investments?  KO: Well, everybody's intrigued right now about crypto. They really are. We've kind of turned the corner from an asset class that was at war with the regulator to one that's generally accepted now. And as a result, I would say probably seven out of 10 questions I get are, what should I be doing with crypto, if anything? And where does it fit into my alternative asset class of my portfolio because we've always thought about it, OK. I'm going to buy some gold maybe, or I'm going to do some private equity, or I'm going to buy some real estate, which are a little different than traditional stocks and bonds, which are far more liquid. But crypto has found its way into the psyche of the average investor now. I would say it's more than half the questions I get and which crypto and how to hold it and all of that is definitely part of the narrative.  JS: I know you're not a fan of the ETF. I think last I read it, I saw you have 11% of your portfolio invested in crypto. You can let me know if that's changed, but what do you tell those people?  KO: It has changed. We just did our mark to market last week. We're at 18% now. We're probably going to cross 20 soon. You've got to remember, I also own positions in companies like Circle. I'm a big guy on the picks and shovels. I mean, want to own, think about this, if you could have gone back in time and somebody said to you, would you like to own a piece of the Nasdaq  in its early days or the New York Stock Exchange and be an owner of the exchange where you're agnostic. You know, of course you'd say yes, because you're agnostic to the price of the assets that trade there. You get a fee every time they trade. And so for me, you know, when I start to think about digital payment systems outside of Tether, I really want to be USDC. Where do I get the leverage on USDC other than owning it? And I can stake it or lend it, which I do.  JS: A resounding yes. It would be a resounding yes.  KO: I want to own Circle, which is where USDC comes from. So I own a piece of Circle. So how do I mark to market the value of Circle? Obviously, its IPO was delayed, it seemed, perpetually. But now with the changing environment, and I have no inside knowledge of this, I'm just a shareholder, I think the opportunity for that platform to become a public platform is higher than it was just, say six months ago. And so I've held it for years. And so it's sort  When I think about M2, I own M2 through a company called Phoenix that trades on the ADX. To me, M2 is going to actually take out Binance one day, slowly bleeding assets over to it because unfortunately, CZ is in jail and is a felon now. So a lot of institutions can't use that platform. He's one of the largest shareholders, if not the shareholder of Binance.  Obviously that lack of transparency is frowned upon now by regulators. There's so much that has changed since we last talked. All the crypto cowboys are gone and now the regulators are in total control. And you have to think about that in the context of the global environment for owning this asset class.  JS: Curious if you look at any crypto-adjacent stocks. I know you mentioned Circle. We have Coinbase, MicroStrategy, the bitcoin mining stocks that are now starting to diversify into AI. Are you looking at any of those as part of your portfolio or are you really kind of focused on what we've just talked about? And then of course bitcoin and ether.  KO: That's a very intuitive question. And let's go to what's changed in bitcoin mining. Now that we know with certainty that the ETF is here to stay, now that we know with certainty that large financial institutions want bitcoin, let's just stay on bitcoin for a second before we go to ETH, just bitcoin. Where is this going to be produced? Because it used to be, if you went to a state like North Dakota, which has low cost of power, or Oklahoma or West Virginia,  They were against bitcoin because it was at war with the regulator. That's changed now. So Oklahoma recently changed at the state level their taxes on bitcoin mining and now it's pro-bitcoin mining. So rather than invest in stocks of bitcoin miners, I'm just doing my own mining. I'm going and buying power contracts. I'm very fortunate to know some of the largest bitcoin miners so I can go into partnership with them and build facilities. BitZero is one of those I've got in Norway. So I'm an investor in mining my own bitcoin. And we hold those on the balance sheets of the companies that I'm a shareholder in. And that's the majority of my bitcoin positions, which is why I don't need ETFs. But, what a change in the last 12 months. I used to go to Capitol Hill and people say, we're never going to, in New York state, we're never going to mine bitcoin.  Bitcoin is now going mainstream. So why wouldn't you want to be a miner of it, particularly when you're storing hydroelectricity that's going over a waterfall and turning it into an asset that holds value in perpetuity? You know, there's a different argument. It was a very big negative green thing initially that's going away now that there's solar wind, hydro. And so I see bitcoin mining almost like a real estate play. And we have right now three different projects within our shop.  JS: I want to turn the conversation shortly over to the ETH ETF because you and I have spoken about this before you brought it up just now you're not a big ETF guy but this is big news in the crypto space those ETFs finally got approved yesterday several different market watchers asset managers are saying they expect to see billions in the next year or year and a half pour into these ETFs do you think that some of the advertising I've seen for the ETF or the education out there really seems like it's targeted to an older crowd, the boomers. Do you think that we're going to see these inflows into these products or do you think people are going to start learning more about the spot products and investing directly in the assets like you've just said?  KO: Well, I think both. I think what will happen in ETH, it'll be 20% of the flow will be held in the ETF because so many advisers on their compliance back offices do not allow wallets of any kind. And so they can buy the ETF very much like a stock and show it directly to their clients on their statements. And, I think that will suck up a lot of demand. I think it'll be very successful. I just would never pay the fees myself. I can't even imagine why I would do that.  It's sort of when you become educated about the whole crypto opportunity and digital payment systems eventually, and also when you look at what's going on, let's take back to up in Canada, Wonderfy, they're building their own second layer on top of their platform to provide wallets and security and make ease of use for holding assets in their own, you know, secure wallet system. And I think Coinbase did the same thing, and was very successful. So these exchanges and the one that WonderFi is going to do in Australia is going to do the same thing, M2, same thing. They're all going to do it so that you have a decision to make. Let's say you're going to put a 5% weighting into crypto or maybe 10%, 5% into ETH, 5% into bitcoin, the most liquid of the tokens.  If you could just open an account on an exchange like M2 or WonderFi, transfer in whatever the dollars you want from Fiat, and then actually have that as an app that's secure and is completely compliant with your regulator and your tax authorities, why would you pay the fees on an ETF? I don't understand why you would do that. I think 80% of the people will eventually go to the exchanges the same way that they go to exchanges for stocks. And so, I see very low fees. I see total transparency. I see complete compliance and lots of liquidity in the traditional manner. So it's kind of ironic that we've gone through the whole crypto cowboy phase and we're right back to where crypto should be integrated into the world's global financial services system. It's been a remarkable ride.  JS: I interviewed Anthony Scaramucci recently, and he told me, I'm actually curious to hear your thoughts on this. He told me that he thinks that Gary Gensler actually did a good thing for the industry by slowing it down and allowing the fraud, the dark parts of the industry to be washed out so that we could get to where we are now.  KO: I actually took a lot of heat for my statements about Gensler. I went, I've spent a lot of time on the Hill. I'm an advocate for digital payment systems, you know, stablecoin bills, all the things that came through. I worked the Hill on those. What I saw with Gensler was consistency. I watched him getting absolutely fried like a chicken in front of the Senate and he held his ground. He was consistent. He never varied.  So you got exactly his position. everybody else made the assumption you could just go in there and beat him up and he'd change his mind. He never did. He was completely consistent. And he said, I want this to be compliant over and over and over again. And after a while, I thought to myself, the guy has made it clear. If you're going to be successful in this space, you're going to have to get on board with his vision of what this looks like. And lo and behold, he went after...  the FTX crowd, he went after the Binance crowd and he won. You know, they say, he lost cases. No, he didn't. These guys are in jail. I don't know how you say he lost and he's not even finished yet with the civil litigation on Binance. He just keeps going. And I think Congress has gotten comfortable with him. So I'm in his camp because I'm now in a safer place to be an investor in places like Binance or like M2. Sorry, I'm not an investor in Binance let me make that clear. M2, Wondrify, those are compliant. They're abiding, they abide by Gensler's code of, ADGM is the regulator in M2 over in Dubai and in Canada, it's a Canadian regulator, the OSC. But they listen to Gensler all the time. For me, I now feel comfortable that I'm not in some conflict with a regulator. I just don't want that. It's just, doesn't, what everybody learned, it creates no value. Going to war with Gensler is dumb. It's dumb.  JS: It's interesting that you say you feel more comfortable because a lot of the industry says they they feel uncomfortable because of the slow move to get clear regulation. What would you say to those folks?  KO: So what I would say to them is the reason you want to get on the Gensler train, even though you're holding your nose, is that gets you the other 80% of the market that won't play until they feel that they are compliant with their own compliance departments. These are large financial institutions, pension plans, sovereign wealth. They don't play until they're safe because the majority of their assets are trading on the S&P 500, where they have to be 100%.  So they're not interested in a rogue 5% position. It's going to cause them headaches every day on a mark-to-market basis. And so I think a lot of the early pioneers, if you wish, you want to call them that, the crypto pioneers that are still around, understand that compliance was the key to unlock value. And it will remain that way. And I've certainly come to that way of thinking. I don't think any other way. I have no interest in raging against Gensler or any other regulator at all. Because I think the world has decided that bitcoin is here to stay, digital payment systems are here to stay, ETH is here to stay, some other tokens maybe too. Solana looks good right now. There's a lot of different ones. Everybody has their favorites. HBAR. I have a lot of positions and I keep them because I want diversification. And they're slowly been growing.  JS: I asked you what the worst investment you ever made was. What's the best investment you've ever made? I know you've made a lot of good ones, but what sticks out to you as one of the best?  KO: Well, I always say this to encourage people to take their first step. The best investment I've ever made was in myself to make the decision to go out on my own and at first start a business and then eventually become an investor. Two-thirds of the people never do that. They just can't get there from the risk profile. And I really urge people to do that. Your number one investment should always be yourself. And that will reward you in many good and bad ways. Obviously. I mean, it's not a life for everybody but the whole purpose of that comment is It's not about the pursuit of money. It never was about the pursuit of money, it's the pursuit of personal freedom that really is the reward of entrepreneurship and investing and being a business owner.  It's where you decide what your life is going to be. Now, it's not easy. It's difficult and there's lots of challenges. But look at us right now. We're sitting here having this interesting conversation. I want to be doing it. I can afford to do it. If I want to jump in that pool, I can go do that. If I don't want to work at all today or take any phone calls, I can do that too. But I can do whatever I want. And I wish that for everybody.  And my whole point is that it is my best investment. And yet, having said all that, I work harder today than I ever have. I work sometimes 20 hours a day and I love everything I do because I'm now a global investor. I was on the phone to the wee hours to Abu Dhabi yesterday. I mean, I just think it's what's going on in the world today. So interesting, such opportunities, you know, just I was working on a new watch it‚Äôs being designed in Geneva for 2025. I'm a big watch collector, a great asset class, one of my best performing. so, you know, things that really interest me. So that's my best investment. Now, specifically, recently, a remarkable outcome, and this is going to the idea that you don't know what's gonna work. I remember a woman named Aniskaya three years ago. Pitching me and I'm going to use Shark Tank platform again, although I do many deals that are not Shark Tank, but this one was. She came on and had a cat DNA testing kit.  JS: I saw that episode. I remember it.  KO: Yes, I'm glad. And I said, why would anybody spend $29 when you could buy a new cat for five? It made no sense to me. But she was so persuasive. She articulated such an incredible vision about collecting data. And nobody wanted to give her a dime, but I did because I just said, I mean, how can I say no to this woman? She just won't stop. I basically gave her a quarter of a million dollars to stop. And then she turned around and turned that into a huge company. It was so big, it was bought by Zoetis, which is a spinoff from Pfizer, and we had an NDA on the purchase price. It was an all-cash deal. I was stunned. I was stunned. Now I love cats. I used to hate cats. I love cats. I love cats. I mean, that company has gone on to do incredible things. And Anna has moved to Florida with me. She lives in Miami. Wonderful entrepreneur. It's really funny that 70% of my successes over 20 years have been companies run by women on the venture side of things.  I'm very proud of it because I'm agnostic. I'd give money to a goat if I could make money. I mean, I'm not into this sexism stuff. I think women are fantastic managers. They reduce risk immensely. If you want something done, give it to a busy mother. I'm thinking about Sarah right now who runs Blue Land, another monster company that has crystallized cleaning fluids. She's gonna hit 50 million in sales this year. I invested in her when I think she had no sales.  So I mean, it's another startup run by a woman who's just got myopic focus on success. She's a beast. And this is the kind of person I want to back and I want to invest in while I do the other things I do. So I've got a family of entrepreneurs. They keep me busy. I'm very active now, as we talked about. Bitcoin mining going just back to that, that's actually real estate. That's what that is. When you're building these data centers, these are real estate. I've got a deal I'm working on right now. Just before we got on, I was working on the P &L for this and I've got the contract to purchase the land. I won't say which state it is because it's very competitive, but it's over 100 acres. So, I'm very active in this space.  JS: So would you say when we're looking at bitcoin miners, the real estate, the land that they're on is maybe worth more than the business as we hit more and more halvings and the rewards become less and less?  KO: You're very, very astute on that. Here's what you need. You have to find a state with power. You need to find a state with fiber. You need to find a state with permits, and you need to find a state that allows backup generators. These are not easy to do. It's taken me years to form the relationships I have with states like Oklahoma, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Montana, North Dakota. I have to go there. In fact, I'm going there this Saturday. I'm going to Iowa. I actually believe that these states have been ignored for so long and yet they have such tremendous opportunities from providing power and permits. You can't do business in New York on bitcoin, but you can certainly do it in other states. I mean, New York should be number one in bitcoin because they've got behind the meter at Niagara Falls, but you can't get anything done there. Everybody knows that. They're kind of in the penalty box right now and nobody invests there. But one day that could change with different management. So I work the path of least resistance. I go to states where the governors and the senators makes sense and are pro crypto and are pro digital payment systems, pro digitization, pro-bitcoin and pro-bitcoin mining and pro-data centers.  JS: All right, Kevin, we gotta wrap it up, and I have to ask you about the election here in the United States before I let you go. As we know, President Joe Biden said that he's not gonna be running for reelection. Trump has emerged as this pro-crypto candidate. I would love to get your perspective on if you think that a new Democratic nominee could win over some of that crypto audience, and if you think a Trump presidency will be good for crypto.  KO: Well, we have heard from Trump already on crypto and he is pro-digitization, pro-digital payment systems, pro-crypto, pro-bitcoin. So we know that's in his policy. We don't yet know any policy yet from it's just been hours since Kamala Harris has been, well, I don't know if it's firm yet. She doesn't have all the data. I mean, I'm a little surprised to be honest with you. They didn't run a process after the Biden dropout because she doesn't actually have much of a track record on anything. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. We're going to have to wait and hear what she's got. But I remember in 2020, she was the first to drop out of the race. She got no delegates. So she's never been tested. And I'm surprised the party just gave her this coronation, so to speak. I would have liked to have seen a process. But she's obviously an intelligent woman. So maybe she has to read the room a little.  And the country has moved more to the middle. So we have to wait to hear her policy, including the crypto policy. But for me, as an investor in energy, I'm very interested to hear. I'm tired of, you know, I understand the rhetoric between parties. If you hate Trump, you hate Trump and you won't vote for him. But I don't really care about that. I care about the policy of each party. So I have the policies now on energy. I've got, you know, a tax policy from Trump. We've got border policy. We don't have much foreign policy, but some inkling of it. We had a speech from Doug Bergen last week, which many people think he will be, by the way, a North Dakota guy. So pro-energy for the energy secretary. That would be interesting. I have nothing yet from the Democrats. So I'm looking forward to hearing that. I think it'll be a very competitive race now.  But it's really gonna boil down to a policy. And we've got to hear where the country wants to go. I think it wants to be in the center. I think it wants to be pro-crypto. It wants to be pro-digitization, pro-economy. I'm always an advocate for entrepreneurship. 62% of our jobs in America are created by companies between five and 500 employees. So want to see a lot of support for them. And then I will continue to do what I do. I mean, I'm kind of agnostic to politics. I don't make money with politics.  KO: I make money with policy. And I would suggest to everybody to think about that a little bit. In the end, don't get emotionally involved in politics. That's a fool's game because it changes all the time. If you stay focused on policy, that's how you can actually become a good investor, a good manager, a good business owner, and you can pursue the American dream. It's all on policy.  JS: Well, let me ask you this. I know you recently said that everyone in financial services knows that Jamie Dimon wants that Treasury Secretary position. I know you said that he would be fantastic at it. He has been outspoken against bitcoin. What do you think that would mean for the crypto industry if Dimon took that position?  KO: He's pragmatic about crypto. His own clients want it. He's not a fan. He's sort of in the Warren Buffett camp. I don't think you're going to change his mind on it. But he's also pragmatic if his customers, the institutions he services, want, and they do. Larry Fink, the largest institution on earth, has basically said yes to bitcoin. It's going to get an asset allocation. The game's over. I mean, he's the largest asset manager in the world. And so I think Jamie Dimon understands that.  I am an advocate for him to be somewhere involved in giving financial policy. I think it'd be very important to have that experience, that international experience. And so for either party, either for Trump or for the Democrats, he would be fantastic. I mean, I want the best for America. I want the best managers because I don't care who's in the White House. I care what the policy is. I want to see it well managed because I know who's ever there now could change in four years, but my investments won‚Äôt.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | ZRX,Jennifer Sanasie,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/23/shark-tanks-kevin-oleary-on-crypto-investing-ether-etfs-and-gary-gensler,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92177078f92d1f6b07e1a0200c5f92967bfdec00-2966x1668.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum: Similarities, Differences And Considerations","Summary As the digital assets space evolves, it‚Äôs important for investors to understand the distinctions between the two largest cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin‚Äôs strength lies in its simplicity, scarcity and credibility as an alternative monetary instrument that exists independently from governments and central banks. Ethereum‚Äôs appeal is in its flexibility and ability to support decentralized applications through smart contracts. This makes it analogous to a revenue-generating app store that‚Äôs open source. Given these fundamental differences, investors can view Bitcoin and Ethereum not as competitors but as distinct assets. They each address different use cases and reflect different drivers of return and risk. By Jay Jacobs Introduction Of Bitcoin And Ethereum Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and play pivotal roles in the broader blockchain ecosystem. 1 Both assets have attracted significant attention from investors, developers, and enterprises due to their unique features and potential applications. But how could investors consider these assets for their portfolios? This comparison aims to help potential investors understand the nuances between Bitcoin and Ethereum, focusing on their underlying technology, value propositions, and investment theses. Figure 1: Bitcoin and Ethereum have emerged as the world‚Äôs predominant crypto assets Share of total crypto asset market cap Source: The Tie and CoinGecko, as of April 30, 2024. Ethereum‚Äôs market capitalization is measured by its native token, ether. BNB is the third largest non-stablecoin cryptoasset and it comprises less than 4% of the crypto market. Chart description: Stacked area chart displaying the total cryptoasset market cap held by Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptoassets. What Are The Main Differences Between Bitcoin And Ethereum? Bitcoin Bitcoin, launched in 2009, was the first form of internet-native money to gain widespread global adoption and it remains the largest by market cap today. Bitcoin is designed to serve as a decentralized alternative to traditional government-issued money, and it enables value to be transferred between peers without a centralized intermediary. Among its key features: Simplicity : Bitcoin focuses on facilitating simple value transfers, with limited ability to be used for other applications, reducing technical risk. Fixed supply: New issuance of Bitcoin is halved about every four years, with total Bitcoin supply capped at 21 million coins. 2 (Learn more about the Bitcoin halving ) Stability: It is difficult to change Bitcoin‚Äôs code, reinforcing its value proposition as an alternative monetary instrument rather than a constantly evolving technology platform. Ethereum Ethereum, launched in 2015, is a flexible blockchain enabling the next generation of decentralized applications (dApps) to emerge through the introduction of self-executing contracts, known as smart contracts. Think of Ethereum as an open-source app store that generates revenues as more users interact with applications on Ethereum, including tokenized assets, like stablecoins, or decentralized financial services. Ethereum‚Äôs native currency, ether, is the token used to transact in the Ethereum ecosystem. Among its key features: Flexibility: Ethereum is designed to be flexible and can execute more complex transactions, giving it a variety of use cases. Dynamic supply: The supply of ether is dynamic, and ether‚Äôs supply can shrink or grow depending on several variables, including network usage. Constantly evolving: Ethereum has the largest blockchain developer community focused on building applications and making technical improvements to the protocol to support the next generation of applications. 3 Figure 2: Understanding key differentiators between Bitcoin and Ethereum Caption : Table displaying specific differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Differences include: value proposition, launch date, founder, market cap, supply cap and consensus mechanism.

The above table is for illustration purposes only. It serves as a general summary and is not exhaustive. This information should not be relied upon as a primary basis for an investment decision. How Do Investors View Bitcoin And Ethereum? While Bitcoin and Ethereum share similarities, namely that they are both digital assets untethered from government-issued currencies and central bank policy, their points of distinction are notable for how investors may view them in a portfolio context. Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition lies in its role as a finite supply, non-sovereign monetary alternative. It is largely seen as an instrument to hold wealth and potentially hedge against inflation and economic instability. Bitcoin‚Äôs simplicity and lack of ties to the real economy make it a pure expression of decentralization, providing potential insulation from the challenges associated with any one nation or government. Ethereum‚Äôs value proposition lies in its flexibility and ability to support more sophisticated applications beyond simple value transfers, including supporting DeFi (decentralized financial services), stablecoins (tokenized fiat currencies), and tokenized securities, to name a few. An investment in Ethereum is a belief that more applications will be built on its open and permissionless programming infrastructure, attracting more users, more revenue, and expanding the universe in which ether resides as a programmable form of money. Figure 3: Understanding prominent investment themes Caption: Table displaying the prominent investment themes behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. Global Monetary Alternative Bet On Blockchain Adoption Global, decentralized, and non-sovereign asset that could serve as a hedge against increasing global disorder and declining trust in governments, banks, and fiat currencies Core infrastructure that underpins a diverse range of blockchain-based applications and is crucial to the continued adoption and integration of blockchain technology Prevalent narrative Bitcoin Ethereum Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market matures, understanding the nuances of each asset will be crucial for informed investment decisions. Bitcoin and Ethereum offer distinct value propositions for investors. Bitcoin‚Äôs strength lies in its simplicity, immutability, and status as the most credible non-sovereign monetary alternative. In contrast, Ethereum's appeal is its versatility and potential to revolutionize various industries with smart contract-powered dApps. Bitcoin's future is closely tied to its adoption as a non-sovereign alternative to government-issued money, while Ethereum's future will be shaped by its technological advancements and expanding use cases. We believe a blend of these assets may provide a more representative exposure to the quickly evolving crypto market than either of them in isolation. Investors may want to consider their risk tolerance, investment horizon, and the specific attributes of each asset when making investment decisions. ¬© 2024 BlackRock, Inc.

42417619,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZHrB,1721760813,"Bitcoin ETFs Have Proven Popular, Ethereum ETFs Could Demonstrate Crypto‚Äôs True Investment Value","Authors' views and opinions are their own and not associated with CoinDesk Indices.  The cryptocurrency industry is going mainstream.  In the U.S., the post-Sam Bankman Fried era of regulatory hostility has ended as the fall elections loom and Democrats and Republicans alike realize that many of their constituents ‚Äî more than 50 million by last count ‚Äî are crypto investors. And recent polls show that voters want their country to take a global lead in blockchain technology on which cryptocurrency and other emerging applications are based.  After years of denials, for instance, the SEC earlier this year approved ETFs pegged to the bitcoin spot market. The financial industry has since experienced one of the most successful launches in ETF history with nearly $16 billion in net inflows as of the beginning of July. Clearly, bitcoin‚Äôs digital-gold narrative‚Äîdue to its limited supply‚Äîresonated with investors, who can now trade these spot ETFs just like any other security, directly from their brokerage account.  The same holds true for ether, the native cryptocurrency for the Ethereum blockchain, which the SEC is expected to approve for spot ETFs any day now. With nearly $400 billion in market capitalization and approximately $1billion in annual income, ether‚Äôs narrative is more difficult to define than Bitcoin‚Äôs simple and accessible digital gold story.  Pundits have variously described Ethereum as ‚Äúultrasound money,‚Äù ‚Äúdigital oil,‚Äù the ‚Äúdigital app store‚Äù or even the ‚Äúinternet bond.‚Äù But what they all agree on is that ether is a token‚Äîa blockchain digital asset‚Äîwith a stable supply, utility and, for many, a compelling yield. On the surface, these are very attractive characteristics for investors who are asking ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù when it comes to cryptocurrency ETF investments after Bitcoin.  Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has a stable native token supply. But Ethereum is more than digital gold 2.0. Across the Ethereum ecosystem, countless decentralized applications use so-called smart contracts‚Äîcomputer code that automatically executes if certain conditions are met.  Today, those applications and their smart contracts are used to swap tokens, make payments, tokenize real-world assets‚Äîincluding Treasury bonds‚Äîor execute a myriad other programmable activities. To register these transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, market participants need ether to pay fees called ‚Äúgas.‚Äù This dynamic drives demand for the ether token.  For investors, another exciting and differentiating characteristic of ether is its yield, currently trending between 3 and 4%. Unlike Bitcoin, which relies on ‚Äúminers'' to solve energy-intensive computations to secure its network, Ethereum depends on ‚Äústakers‚Äù to pledge their tokens to secure the value of the network. For their efforts, those who ‚Äústake‚Äù their tokens earn the network‚Äôs yield. And when adjusted for inflation, Ethereum‚Äôs real yield is quite competitive with the current yield of U.S. government securities.  Unfortunately, investors will have to forgo Ethereum‚Äôs staking yield when the spot ETF launches. While the exact reasons are not entirely clear, it seems that U.S. regulators simply will not allow it.  To be sure, earning yield is not without risk. Ethereum‚Äôs computer code sanctions and burns the assets of negligent or dishonest staking participants through a process called ‚Äúslashing‚Äù. Also, staked ether is not always readily available to ETF issuers who need it to honor redemptions‚Äîanother known risk.  But, enterprise infrastructure, insurance offerings, benchmarks, and liquidity solutions‚Äîall designed to reduce potential risks and support institutional yield for Ethereum‚Äîare already available or quickly coming online.  All financial products have risks, of course. The important thing for investors is that these risks are adequately disclosed. With disclosures in place and risks addressed, U.S. investors should have the choice of investing in a yield-bearing version of the spot ETF.  Time will tell if the ether spot ETF in the U.S. will begin trading with a whimper or a bang. Yield or not, though, the initial launch of the spot ether ETF serves an important purpose. As traditional investors familiarize themselves with the asset behind the ETF, it promises to bring a new generation ‚Äúon chain‚Äù‚Äîperhaps in search of that elusive yield, or perhaps to unlock the power of the decentralized, blockchain-enabled economy that awaits.

31436891,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631118,1721757622,Dogecoin Falling Wedge Pattern: Crypto Analyst Predicts Breakout To $0.22,"Crypto Analyst World of Charts has highlighted a bullish pattern that could send the Dogecoin (DOGE) price to new highs. The analyst predicted that the foremost meme coin could rise to $0.22 when this move occurs. How Dogecoin Will Rise To $0.22 World of Charts mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin is approaching a falling wedge resistance. If it breaks out, the meme coin could enjoy a 66% price move and rise to $0.22, based on the chart he shared. Interestingly, the analyst added that Dogecoin could rise sharply to $0.30. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Reach A New All-Time High? Crypto Analyst Reveals Why $90,000 Is Possible Dogecoin has already arrived at the moment of truth, seeing as it is currently trading at around the $0.13 range, which World of Charts noted the falling wedge resistance is at. The foremost meme coin looks well-equipped to break out of this resistance level, considering the current bullish outlook of the market. On-chain metrics also support such a parabolic rally for Dogecoin. For instance, there has been a significant increase in large transactions, with Bitcoinist reporting that Dogecoin whales bought millions worth of DOGE this past week. Data from the market intelligence IntoTheBlock also shows that these whales have been busy, with almost 10 billion DOGE traded in the last 24 hours by these whales. Further data from IntoTheBlock also shows that there has been an increase of over 800% in large holders‚Äô inflow, meaning that these whales are heavily accumulating the foremost meme coin. Such a wave of accumulation can send Dogecoin‚Äôs price flying and cause it to possibly reach World of Chart‚Äôs predicted price target of $0.30. Meanwhile, it is also worth mentioning that most Dogecoin addresses (78%) are currently in the money, meaning they are in profits. As such, the meme coin will unlikely face significant selling pressure as it continues to move to the upside. Besides, those wallets in profit could help mitigate the impact of any selling pressure that could come from the 22% wallet addresses that could look to break even once their investment becomes profitable. What Next For DOGE? Crypto analyst Rekt Capital mentioned in an X post that Dogecoin is retesting the Macro downtrend as new support. He claimed that a successful retest at this range would ‚Äúfully confirm‚Äù the end of the Macro downtrend and the beginning of a new Macro uptrend. Based on the chart the analyst shared, DOGE could rise to as high as $0.4 once this new Macro uptrend begins. Related Reading: Don‚Äôt Get Shaken Out, Analyst Says Bitcoin And Altcoins Rally Is Just Starting Crypto analyst Capt Toblerone also recently updated his Dogecoin chart analysis.

Ethereum is a type of cryptocurrency, similar to bitcoin. MoneyTalk's Greg Bonnell discusses with Andres Rincon from TD Securities. U.S. financial regulators have approved new Ethereum exchange traded funds, making them available for trade for the first time in U.S. markets. Andres Rincon, Head of ETF Sales and Strategy at TD Securities, discusses the implications with MoneyTalk‚Äôs Greg Bonnell. Transcript Greg Bonnell - US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the availability of several spot Ethereum ETFs for trading on American markets. Joining us now to discuss is Andres Rincon, head of ETF Sales and Strategy at TD Securities. Andres, always great to chat with you about these developments. Andres Rincon - Thanks for having me. It seems like deja vu all over again. I was here not too long ago talking about Bitcoin, and now we're talking about ether. Greg Bonnell - Yeah, we did a while back, a few months, but now that we're here, we are talking about Ethereum. These developments, walk us through what they mean. Andres Rincon - Yeah, so regulators, or the SEC in the US, basically gave a heads up to the issuers in the US and said to file what we call an S-1 filing, which is really a prelude to these issuers launching these ETFs. So this was last week, and now, today, they've launched several ETFs in the US that cover ether. And really what they do is they give exposure to spot ether in the US. Historically, what we had only in the US was exposure to futures-based ether ETFs, and now we have spot ether ETFs in the US. Greg Bonnell - So that's a nice understanding of these products. Talk about the type of products that we're going to see out there. What are investors expecting? Andres Rincon - Yeah, so we expect between 5 and 10 over the next few weeks. I know a lot of them were launched today, but we expect many, many more over the next few weeks. What we're going to see is your traditional vanilla spot ether ETF. So it's similar to spot Bitcoin ETFs. What you have is an investor can now give some money to an ETF. They'll buy the ETF. That cash then goes and is purchased by the issuer. They go then on an exchange, and they purchase spot ether, and then they actually put it in cold storage. So they're put in cold storage for custody purposes in the same way that you would do if you open an account on an exchange and had your own cold storage, let's say. So you're going to see an array of products from your traditional issuers in the US, like the BlackRocks and the Fidelitys. They're the ones that have grown quite a bit in the US. And also, not too long from now, we'll also likely see the Grayscale ether fund convert into an ETF, which already has $9 billion in assets under management. So this industry, or this space, is going to grow quite quickly. We expect it to be around 1/4 of the crypto ETF market in the same way that it is in Canada that we're seeing here, the ratio. So, slowly, we'll see some growth there. In terms of fees, we're going to see-- call it, on the low end, about 0.15 of a percent in terms of management fee to the average likely to be at 0.22 of a percent. But many of them very likely will also cut their fees for a year and waive them for a year in the same way that we saw that for Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Greg Bonnell - Great primer there on the products and what they're going to look like for investors. At the same time, we need to speak about risks. What are the risks around a product like this? Andres Rincon - Very similar to Bitcoin ETFs. So what you see, really number one, is custodial risk. At the end of the day-- I mentioned cold storage. That cold storage is professionally managed and is regulated in the US. But at the end of the day, there's always the risk that it is manipulated or it is not taken care of properly and that those ether coins can be lost, let's say. That's one of the big risks in this space. Obviously very, very well guarded, but it's an important risk to mention. And the other one is price risk, obviously. Greg Bonnell - Markets go up, markets go down. Andres Rincon - Exactly. Greg Bonnell - No different. Andres Rincon - And ether-- ether tends to be volatile to some degree. So it's important to understand the risks and the volatility of ether, or Ethereum, when you're investing in those products. Greg Bonnell - So this is what's happening in the United States. What about the Canadian market? What does it look like when it comes to Ethereum ETFs? Andres Rincon - So it's important to remember that Canada had the first ether ETFs ever in the world, just for starters. We've had them since 2021. And so we now have a fairly broad lineup of ether ETFs. We have 12 ether ETFs. And this is ether ETFs. There's also ether-staking ETFs, which is slightly different. But we have 12 ether ETFs here in Canada from four different issuers, $1.3 billion. And as I said earlier, it's about 1/4 or so, just shy of that, of the crypto ETF landscape here in Canada. So it's a very vibrant market in Canada. It trades quite well. And we have a lot of investors looking for exposure to ether ETFs here in Canada through Canadian ETFs already.

Or Buy Ether Directly?,"Summary Staking yields for Ether have decreased from 4.2% to 3.1% due to more validators coming online, but with Ether prices doubling, the lower yields are not a concern. Interest rates play a crucial role in driving Ether prices, as lower rates make investors more willing to explore higher risk assets like Ethereum. Ethereum spot ETFs provide a regulated channel for investing in Ether's price movements, making it more accessible and less risky compared to trading on crypto exchanges. In March 2023, I covered Ethereum and while I was bullish on Ether I viewed staking as a nice to have rather than a game changer. At the time, I had a 4.2% staking yield on a net basis and the time of writing that yield is just 3.1%. I am not surprised by that, as more validators have come online the APR has tapered but with Ether prices doubling, you won‚Äôt hear me complain about the lower staking yields. More important to the bull case for Ether are application, acceptance and interest rates. Why Interest Rates Are Important To Ethereum Whether you like it or not, cryptocurrencies are still considered high risk assets and when borrowing money becomes more expensive we see that higher risk asset classes become somewhat less desired. I wouldn‚Äôt say that you are better off collecting interest on your fiat instead of receiving staking rewards because my bank still only offers 1.7% interest which doesn‚Äôt beat the 3.1% staking reward. However, the general thought flow is that once interest rates decline investors are more willing to look into higher risk asset classes and Ethereum is one of those. Perhaps, that shows even more strength of cryptocurrencies throughout the higher rate environment that currently exists. Why Ethereum Spot ETFs Are Important? Next to interest rates another driver of Ether prices is the acceptance or application fields and I believe that developments in those areas and more particularly the launch of Ethereum spot ETFs has been a buoying force for the crypto prices. Ethereum spot ETFs could provide significant support to Ethereum prices because it makes investing in Ethereum‚Äôs price movements more broadly accessible via a regulated channel. We all have seen issues with crypto exchanges such as FTX and Binance and it makes it understandable that investors would rather not walk the paths of Ethereum exposure via less regulated or capricious exchanges. So, in some way a crypto ETF catches off some of the risk and makes crypto currencies a better accessible asset class. With catching off risk I mean the possibility to own the asset and not the investment itself, which remains higher risk due to the volatility nature of cryptocurrencies. What Is An Ethereum Spot ETF? An Ethereum spot ETF aims to track the Ethereum price movement and actually holds the underlying commodity. The difference between investing in an ETH ETF and investing in ETH is that when you buy ETH, you have direct exposure to the cryptocurrency while owning through an ETF means you only own shares of ownership in the ETF but not the underlying commodity. While the ETF aims to track the price moment of Ethereum, due to management fees and supply/demand imbalances as well as liquidity in the ETF it could be the case that the ETF does not completely track the cryptocurrency price movements one-on-one. Which ETH Spot ETFs Are Available? To assess which ETH ETF might be most attractive, we have to first look which ETH ETFs have been approved. At the time of writing the following ETH ETFs are approved: Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust - NYSEARCA: ETH Franklin Ethereum ETF - BATS: EZET VanEck Ethereum ETF - BATS: ETHV Bitwise Ethereum ETF - NYSEARCA: ETHW 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF - BATS: CETH Fidelity Ethereum Fund - BATS: FETH iShares Ethereum Trust - NASDAQ: ETHA Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF - BATS: QETH Grayscale Ethereum Trust - OTCQX: OTCQX:ETHE Which ETH Spot ETF Has The Lowest Expense Ratio? ETF Name Ticker Symbol Expense Ratio Waiver Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust NYSEARCA: ETH 0.15% Waived for 6 months on first $2 billion AUM is reached Franklin Ethereum ETF BATS: EZET 0.19% Waived for 6 months on first $10 billion AUM. VanEck Ethereum ETF BATS: ETHV 0.20% Waived for 12 months on first $1.5 billion AUM. Bitwise Ethereum ETF NYSEARCA: ETHW 0.20% Waived for 6 months on first $500 million AUM 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF BATS: CETH 0.21% Waived for 6 months on first $500 million AUM Fidelity Ethereum Fund BATS: FETH 0.25% Waived until 1 January 2025 iShares Ethereum Trust NASDAQ: ETHA 0.25% Reduced to 0.12% for 12 months on first $2.5 billion AUM Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF BATS: QETH 0.25% No Grayscale Ethereum Trust OTCQX: ETHE 2.50% No Most ETF issuers have implemented a six month waiver. There are two ETFs without a waiver. The ETHE ETF is going to be see 10% of the ETHE ETF being rolled over to the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and therefore has no waiver. The Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF also seems to have no waiver and a result from expense ratio perspective I don‚Äôt see why this would be the best waiver. I believe that the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust is most attractive because it simply has the lowest What Does The BTC Spot ETF Tell Us? Ticker AUM Fees GBTC 17.63B 1.50% IBIT 20.82B 0.21% BITB 2.57B 0.20% BTCO 495.5M 0.20% HODL 707.47M 0.00% EZBC 431.12M 0.19% FBTC 10.12B 0.25% ARKB 2,734B 0.21% BTCW 83.4M 0.25% DEFI 11.81M TBC% If we look at the BTC spot ETFs, we see that GBTC has the highest fee and most fees are around 0.2% to 0.25% with HODL being the exception with a very generous waiver period. Data by YCharts If we look at the returns, generally we see that the performance is extremely close and GBTC performs better but also has a higher fee. I would not at all draw the conclusion that higher fees are somehow resulting in better returns. The GBTC ETF is converted from a trust so it has a different launch dynamics that is not valid for all ETFs. In general, I believe that somewhat straightforward lower fees result in better performance. With that in mind, the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust would be my preferred pick. Buy Ether or an ETH ETF? While many analysts will likely focus on which ETF to buy, I believe that given the low fees the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust is the obvious choice. However, the SEC approved ETH ETFs under certain conditions and one of those conditions is that the underlying commodity cannot be staked at this point in time. For sponsors to stake the ETF, the rules once again need to be changed and that also means that in case you are willing to own Ether directly that might in fact be the more rewarding option given that you can compound staking rewards instead of paying an expense fee. The drawback is that you can easily buy shares of an ETF, but buying crypto from an exchange can take longer as you have enroll yourself in a crypto exchange, file all paperwork and then to buy and sell you have to validate your transaction. In my case, if I were to buy or sell ETH directly I would have to find my Ledger wallet, log in, log in on the crypto exchange, issue the transfer and then validate the transfer and pay fees. Buying an ETF would still result in transaction fees but purchasing and selling shares would likely happen faster and I don‚Äôt have to go look for my hardware wallet to approve the transaction. So, there are pros and cons. For the time being, I would prefer to hold the coin directly. Conclusion: Spot ETH ETFs Are A Big Step But There Could Be More I believe that the launch of ETH spot ETFs opens ETH to a group of investors that would otherwise not have exposure to crypto due to the process of buying and selling crypto being more elaborate than buying or selling shares or because getting all paperwork in order to trade on a cryptocurrency exchange might be a hassle and over the years some exchanges have put pressure on the reputation of cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges. So, while ETH ETFs do not fully catch off risk in the sense that like with any investment risk is always an element, they make the process of buying and selling more convenient and accessible. The big question is when the underlying commodities could be staked, because that would most definitely be a game changer and could also determine which ETH ETFs are actually most attractive in the longer term. For now, if you cannot buy ETH-USD directly I would opt for the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. It should also be noted that Fidelity is the only self-custody ETF, the other ETFs mostly use Coinbase as custodian. So, if you want a self-custody ETF you would want to consider FTBC as an alternative.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4705875-which-spot-ethereum-etf-buy-eth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31435927.jpeg

The spot Ethereum ETF is expected to create buying pressure on Ethereum, potentially leading to an altcoin rally and changing market cap dominance dynamics. Despite risks of volatility and initial outflows, the spot Ethereum ETF is a strong catalyst for Ethereum's price growth and institutional investment. It's been a great year for crypto so far. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has seen a 59% gain YTD and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has recorded a 52% gain. The floodgates of crypto investing are now open to institutional investors. The year 2024 can well be called the year of crypto spot ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January and inflow records were broken sooner than anticipated. Then, what began as rumors of a potential spot Ethereum ETF is now a reality. What we‚Äôve seen with the Bitcoin ETFs so far has been increased demand. The demand for the ETFs has put buying pressure on Bitcoin. The spot BTC ETFs average $100 million inflows daily while produced BTC (after the halving) is around 450 BTC daily (around $30 million at BTC's current $66,000 market price). Demand for BTC is constantly outpacing supply due to the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Altcoins started gaining popularity when programmability on the blockchain layer became a thing around 2014. Since altcoins gained popularity, Ethereum has led the altcoin bull market back to back. Other altcoins have moved up and down the market cap rank ladder over the years, but Ethereum has consistently maintained the number two market cap position, behind Bitcoin, over the years. The foremost altcoin is strongly positioned to lead the imminent altcoin rally this time also, with the spot Ether ETF catalyzing demand in the mid to long term. The Spot Ethereum ETF as a Major Catalyst What we can deduce from the spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch is that they have been well received by institutional investors. Currently, the top 80 holders of these spot BTC ETFs are institutional investors. The buying pressure created by the spot Bitcoin ETFs makes Bitcoin rebound quicker from dips these days. For example, the Bitcoin sell-off by the German government earlier this month, which caused Bitcoin and the total crypto market to see a price decline across the board, was subsequently followed by weeks of inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs (a three-week inflow run totaling $3.2 billion ), thus making Bitcoin and the crypto market rebound swiftly. The spot Ethereum ETF is bound to create a similar buying pressure on Ethereum (though I anticipate it to be on a much smaller scale compared to the BTC inflows) and the resultant effects of such demand on ETH price will be seen in due course. Bitcoin is inarguably a household name in the crypto space, and some analysts might speculate that other crypto-related spot ETFs will be overshadowed by Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. However, I strongly see a situation where institutional investors that are already heavily invested in the spot Bitcoin ETFs diversify their crypto-related portfolio by equally investing in the spot Ethereum ETFs. A stronger case for this, in my view, is supported by the fact that the spot Bitcoin ETFs have performed well since launch. This serves as a precursor, potentially boosting the sentiment among institutional investors to invest in a fresh crypto spot ETF. And rightly so, institutional investors are already showing interest in the spot Ethereum ETFs with noteworthy seed investment disclosures in the S-1 filings of the ETFs. Bitwise disclosed Pantera Capital‚Äôs interest in purchasing $100 million of its spot Ether ETF. I expect institutions to diversify into the Ether ETFs as a complementary asset, similar to how institutional investors holding gold ETFs often invest in silver ETFs as part of their diversification strategy. Bitcoin‚Äôs early stories resonate well among retail investors in and out of crypto. The 10,000 BTC pizza story , behind the Bitcoin pizza day, when an early Bitcoin user paid for two large Papa John‚Äôs ( PZZA ) pizzas with 10,000 BTC in May 2010, worth around $41 at the time; that pizza payment is worth around $670 million today - a whopping 1,634,146,000% change. This shows just how Bitcoin has been the best-performing asset over the past decade and a half. Looking back at such a percentage gain in just a little over a decade, most investors feel they missed out on a major wealth-creation opportunity. ‚ÄúWhat's the next Bitcoin?‚Äù is a common question among investors seeking alpha in crypto. Many crypto investors seek alpha through crypto altcoins. The main deterring factor for most investors in investing in altcoins is the much higher risk they pose compared to BTC. This deterrent has been amplified by the SEC‚Äôs past crackdown on altcoins, and the conflicting information about their classification as securities or non-securities. The SEC‚Äôs U-turn on Ethereum, ending its investigation into Ethereum 2.0 in June, followed by the approval and subsequent trading of spot Ethereum ETFs has given Ethereum a broader legitimacy among altcoins. Traditional investors seeking alpha in crypto will naturally turn their attention to Ethereum, in the meantime. BTC.D (TradingView) The spot Ethereum ETF will also likely change the dynamics of market cap dominance between Bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) has been strongly above 50% since the spots Bitcoin ETFs went live in January, hitting a two-year high of 57% in mid-April. I believe that the spot Ether ETFs will shrink BTC.D as Ethereum also sees demand, with the likelihood of ETH‚Äôs demand spreading to other altcoins - particularly Layer-1 altcoins. The spot Ethereum ETFs going live means that the crypto market will engage more in speculative altcoin trades as investors seek to identify which altcoin will see a spot ETF approval next. This will spark a balance between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance and create an altcoin rally. The scenario of speculative trading in search of the next spot ETF candidate I described above is already underway. For instance, following the approval of the spot Ether ETF 19b-4 forms on May 27, speculation has built up around a potential spot Ripple ( XRP-USD ) ETF. XRP price has surged by about 40% in the past two weeks, now trading above $0.6 on the speculation that the SEC will put its legal brawl with Ripple to bed and a spot XRP ETF filing could be on the horizon. I, however, personally believe that it is likely a wrap for crypto spot ETF approval in the U.S. for this market cycle (or at least for this year) because the regulatory status of most major altcoins remains ambiguous at the moment. This is a stronger reason why I believe Ethereum is positioned to lead the next altcoin, being the only altcoin likely to witness a spot ETF demand. Risks Deribit Crypto investments remain highly volatile. The spot Bitcoin ETF hasn't eliminated Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility, as seen in the recent sudden drop following the German government BTC sell-off. In the same vein, the spot Ethereum ETF will likely not subdue ETH‚Äôs inherent volatility. Ethereum options implied volatility (‚ÄúIV‚Äù) has trended higher as the spot ETFs launch inch closer. Market expectations for near-term volatility have increased. The asset still possesses an extra propensity to deviate from IV forecasts and exhibit a more steep price surge or drop. This steeper decline shouldn't be ruled in the near term as the Mt. Gox ~$9 billion crypto payments fully roll out. TheBlock ETH could see some price decline in the first few trading days as the spot ETFs go live. Grayscale retaining the current high fee of its converted closed-end fund, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), in its spot Ethereum ETF could spell initial outflow. On the spot Ethereum ETF conversion, investors who had previously bought ETHE when it traded around -24% discount to NAV in April, will likely redeem their shares now that it trades around par. The Grayscale fund is currently the world‚Äôs largest Ethereum fund and holds around 2,629,468 ETH, worth around $9.6 billion, in AuM. This could be an overhang. Conclusion Bloomberg What we have witnessed with the spot Bitcoin ETFs launch, shows that the spot ETFs are an investment vehicle that drives up organic demand for a crypto asset. Bitcoin‚Äôs price has correlated with the ETF inflow. Ethereum‚Äôs spot ETF is coming at the right time when Bitcoin‚Äôs post-halving supply reduction and spot ETF inflows have sparked momentum in the crypto market. Ethereum total value staked (CryptoQuant) The Bitcoin halving reduced new Bitcoin supply, then the spot ETFs increased demand - a combo that has created a supply-demand imbalance. Ethereum doesn't undergo a quadrennial halving event and its supply isn't capped like that of Bitcoin. However, Ethereum has evolved and now includes some interesting supply reduction mechanisms that include a gas fee burning structure and validator rewards reduction known by the moniker ‚Äú triple halving .‚Äù Since transitioning to proof-of-stake consensus the issuance of ETH has decreased by about 90%. The Ethereum network is now validated by staking, since the transition to proof of stake. In staking , users lock up ETH to validate transactions on the Ethereum network and in turn receive incentives in the form of ETH rewards. Staking locks up supply, thereby reducing the inflation of Ethereum. The total value staked currently on the ETH network sits at 33.1 million ETH, which is around 28% of ETH‚Äôs current total supply. Staking on Ethereum gained immense traction with the introduction of liquid staking . With the ETF approval, staking becomes a two-edged sword. On the one hand, staking reduces supply thereby putting buying pressure on ETH price as demand for the ETF pent up. On the other hand, investors knowledgeable about staking might opt for staking directly with a liquid staking provider, like Lido, to gain from staking incentives. The funds are not allowed to stake the ETH in their portfolio; hence, no staking rewards for investors gaining exposure via the spot Ethereum ETFs. While this might seem to pose a drawback on the surface, I still believe that the lack of staking capabilities in the funds will have an inconsequential influence on demand for the ETFs. The ETFs are geared towards institutional investors and retail investors who generally care less about the intricacies of blockchain technology. BTC vs ETH ETP products demand (Galaxy) Data compiled by Galaxy shows the existing institutional demand for existing Bitcoin ETPs (excluding spot ETFs) in the U.S. to be about 3.24x of ETH's ETP demand. In other words, ETH sees about 31% of Bitcoin‚Äôs demand. Plugging this ETP demand data into the ~$17 billion inflows the spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded so far in about six months, suggests that the spot Ethereum ETFs could potentially see around $10.5 billion of net inflows per year, or $900 million per month. I arrived at this estimate by first annualizing the ~17 billion six-month net inflows of the spot Bitcoin ETF, which is around $34 billion yearly. Considering Ethereum‚Äôs ETP demand is around 31% of Bitcoin‚Äôs, that gives a rough estimate of $10.5 billion - if the institutional demand for ETPs mirrors the demand for spot Ether ETF. Ethereum‚Äôs spot ETFs coming in a bull market, amidst growing institutional interest in crypto-related investments is an undeniable catalyst for ETH. I have been bullish on ETH since the start of the year. In my last Ethereum coverage in February, which I titled ‚Äú Ethereum: Catalysts In Plain Sight ,‚Äù I anticipated a spot ETF approval as a potential major catalyst for ETH. We are up by 53% since that coverage. At that time, the catalysts were in ‚Äúplain sight‚Äù; today, the catalysts are more apparent. I remain highly bullish on ETH.

31433525,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631126,1721752218,Ethereum Price Stays Flat Despite Today‚Äôs ETF Debut: QCP Explains Why,"In a day marked by the launch of the long-anticipated spot Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States, the market‚Äôs response has been unexpectedly subdued. Analysts from Singapore-based crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital have shed light on the reasons behind this muted reaction, blaming the situation on previous market behaviors and other news from the broader market. Why The Ethereum Price Is Not Skyrocketing In their investor note, QCP Capital points out that the market may be adhering to a ‚Äúbuy the hype, sell the news‚Äù pattern, similar to the US spot Bitcoin ETF launch scenario. When the spot Bitcoin ETF debuted on January 11 this year, Bitcoin prices surged prior to the launch but later fell to $38,000, recording a -21% drawdown in the first 12 days after the launch. This price action was mainly driven by the outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF, which converted from the GBTC Trust and opened the possibility for investors to withdraw their holdings for the first time in years. A similar scenario could be looming for ETH, although there‚Äôs a key difference with Grayscale‚Äôs launch of the ‚ÄúMini ETF.‚Äù To recall, Bitcoin subsequently reached new all-time highs within two months. So, QCP suggests that investors are being cautious and waiting for further developments before making any major moves in the ETH market. Related Reading: US Spot Ethereum ETFs Poised To Draw $1.2 Billion Monthly: Research Firm In addition, general market sentiment, which is heavily influenced by Bitcoin movements, could also play a crucial role. In particular, the transfers of Bitcoin by the US government and Mt. Gox have created a ripple effect that is impacting the dynamics of the crypto market as a whole. This morning, the US government transferred 58,742 BTC to Coinbase, while still holding 213,239 BTC worth approximately $14.2 billion. At the same time, Mt. Gox moved around 47,600 BTC to various wallets, including 5,110 BTC (340.1 million dollars) to Bitstamp. These large-scale movements may contribute to the market‚Äôs cautious stance. While spot prices for Ethereum remain flat, the options market is exhibiting notable activity. QCP observed that 26 July volatility made an impressive 8-vol rally, with the risk reversal (RR) dipping by 3 vols. This signals an increased caution towards potential downside movements. The divergence between the spot and options markets indicates that traders might be preparing for further price drops in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Retraces: Here‚Äôs Why ETH Bulls Must Decisively Break Above $3,500 ‚ÄúThe options market seems to be expecting more downside movement in the near term, exacerbated by the US Government and Mt Gox news,‚Äù QCP commented. Given the current conditions, QCP Capital suggests that Ethereum prices may remain subdued in the short term. The firm highlights potential BTC selling pressures from the US Government and Mt Gox as key factors that could indirectly keep ETH prices from rising. Additionally, with the ETH Spot ETF‚Äôs impact not yet reflected in the market, traders might be waiting for more momentum to build up, possibly in the lead-up to the US elections. QCP‚Äôs investor note concludes, ‚ÄúWith the ETH Spot ETF potentially not impacting prices on the outset, coupled with potential selling pressure from the US Government and Mt Gox, prices may remain subdued until momentum builds up leading to the elections.‚Äù At press time, ETH traded at $3,513, up 0.5% over the past 24 hours.

Interestingly, the Ethereum ETFs ranked among the top 1% regarding ETF volume. Related Reading: Analyst Says Solana Price Will Surge 1,000% To $1,800, Here‚Äôs When Ethereum ETFs Surpass Traditional Launch Volumes According to Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas, the ETH ETFs traded $361 million in the first 90 minutes on launch day, surpassing the typical volume seen at the launch of traditional ETFs. Blachunas said: Here‚Äôs where we at after 90 minutes. $361m total. As a group that number would rank them about 15th overall in ETF volume (about what $TLT and $EEM trade), which is Top 1%. But again compared to a normal ETF launch, which rarely see more than $1m on Day One, all of them have cleared that number and then some. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at asset manager VanEck, highlighted the significance of these figures in the first hours of trading, noting that Ethereum ETFs saw more than 50% of trading volume compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs $610 million on day one, indicating strong investor interest in Ethereum. However, how these numbers will fare at the close remains to be seen. Bitcoin ETFs saw $4.6 billion in volume on their first day of trading in January, which may indicate the future performance of these newly approved index funds for the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market. ETH‚Äôs Price Targets Soar Crypto analyst Doctor Profit shared a report highlighting a potentially massive parabolic move for Ethereum‚Äôs price this year in the wake of the expected inflows in the new Ethereum ETF market. While some anticipate a correction due to the ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù phenomenon, Doctor Profit argues that the market has already factored in the ETF launch but has yet to consider the significant inflows of USD that will flood into the Ethereum ETFs. With Ethereum‚Äôs market cap being three times smaller than Bitcoin‚Äôs, Doctor Profit believes that every dollar invested in ETH is expected to have three times the price impact compared to Bitcoin, positioning Ethereum favorably for substantial price gains. Furthermore, the analyst contends that while Ethereum‚Äôs Grayscale ETH Fund sell pressure is comparable to the Bitcoin ETF launch, the impact is expected to be less severe.

Moving into Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, the price range is expected to expand from $5,500 to $8,000. However, it is in Q2 2025 that Ethereum is expected to significantly jump, with price targets ranging from $8,000 to $14,000.

On July 22, Nestor Nunez, 66, and Antonia Perez Hernandez, 49, separately pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which has a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.  Prosecutors say Nunez, a Spanish citizen, was paid to present himself as the CEO of the Forcount scheme, using the alias ‚ÄúSalvador Molina.‚Äù The real ringleader of the scheme was allegedly 39-year-old Brazilian national Francisley Da Silva, who was arrested by Brazilian authorities in 2022. Hernandez was a senior promoter of the scheme.  Between 2017 and 2021, Forcount‚Äôs promoters targeted Spanish speakers all over the world, often via lavish promotional gatherings, promising them high returns based on profit-sharing from non-existent crypto mining and trading activities.  According to court documents, Forcount‚Äôs promoters lured their victims in by promising them ‚Äúfinancial freedom‚Äù and flaunting their own personal wealth in the form of luxury cars and designer clothing ‚Äì while simultaneously stealing investor deposits and laundering their ill-gotten gains through shell companies and real estate.  One of Nunez and Hernandez‚Äôs co-conspirators, American citizen Juan Tacuri, 46, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in June. He also agreed to forfeit $4 million in criminal proceeds, as well as real estate purchased with victim funds, as part of his plea bargain.  Tacuri will be sentenced in New York on Sept. 24 by District Judge Analisa Torres, the judge who is overseeing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) suit against crypto company Ripple.

Most funds are offering 0.00% fees through waivers, with Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust having the lowest fee at 0.15%. Fidelity's self-stored approach for ETH custody may make FETH the best option for long-term investment. Since the assets in the funds are not staked on-chain, there is a possible opportunity cost in longing ETH through the ETFs. It's been a bit of a strange road for the approval of the spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETFs in the United States. For most of the last couple of years, it seemed as though the spot ETH funds were a long way from approval. This sentiment has been, at least in part, because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has had a highly combative stance on cryptocurrencies from the perspective of many in the industry. But as we've seen this summer, things can happen fast in the world of politics, and the spot ETH ETFs have officially arrived. The New Funds Beginning July 23rd, there are nine different spot ETH ETFs that investors can choose from; seven of which are brand new offerings: Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ) VanEck Ethereum ETF ( ETHV ) Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ) 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF ( CETH ) Fidelity Ethereum Fund ( FETH ) iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ) Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF ( QETH ) In addition to these seven new funds, investors also have the opportunity to invest in two different funds from Grayscale. Grayscale's previously closed end Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) has been converted to an ETF. Additionally, Grayscale is spinning out part of the ETHE fund into a new smaller trust called the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH). As was the case during the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) spot ETF approvals earlier this year, a major factor in deciding which fund to buy is the management fee. Fees and Waivers Given that all of these ETFs are straightforward Ethereum funds, there is very little difference between them regarding how they are structured. Similar to what we see with the BTC ETFs in January, the overwhelming majority of these fund managers are using Coinbase ( COIN ) for asset custody: Name Starting Fee Post-Waiver Waiver Duration AUM Limit Custodian Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust 0.00% 0.15% 6 months $2 billion Coinbase Franklin Ethereum ETF 0.00% 0.19% Through 1/31/25 $10 billion Coinbase VanEck Ethereum ETF 0.00% 0.20% 1 Year $1.5 billion Gemini Bitwise Ethereum ETF 0.00% 0.20% 6 months $0.5 billion Coinbase 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF 0.00% 0.21% 6 months $0.5 billion Coinbase Fidelity Ethereum Fund 0.00% 0.25% Through 12/31/24 Unlimited Fidelity iShares Ethereum Trust 0.12% 0.25% 1 Year $2.5 billion Coinbase Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF 0.25% 0.25% N/A N/A Coinbase Grayscale Ethereum Trust 2.50% 2.50% N/A N/A Coinbase Source: Bloomberg/James Seyffart At the time of launch, there are six different funds that are offering 0.00% fees through a waiver promotion. The length and AUM limit of those waivers vary, but most of them will end in 6 months when those waivers expire, assuming AUM limits are not reached first. If there is robust demand for ETH through these ETF products, we could see waivers expire quicker than 6 months. In that scenario, the Franklin Ethereum ETF may have the best waiver due to its $10 billion AUM limit. I don't personally believe we'll see that much demand for these products combined, let alone for a single ETF, and I detailed my logic on that in a previous Seeking Alpha article: Perhaps the more logical way to estimate ETH investment flow following spot ETFs would be to assume the 27% ETH to BTC AUM ratio that preceded the spot BTC approvals. If we take the $16.7 billion of net capital flow into spot BTC ETFs year to date and assume 27% of that figure will be allocated to spot ETH ETFs upon approval, we get an investor demand figure closer to $4.5 billion. Regardless of how long fee waivers take to expire, the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust will have the lowest fee at 0.15% when it's all said and done. This is a large departure from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which has notably been a high fee offering since its inception as a closed end fund. Frankly, I'm surprised Grayscale isn't simply lowering the ETHE fee rather than spinning out some of the fund into ETH. BTC ETF net flows (BitcoinTreasuries data, Author's table) We've already seen how investors reacted to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) fee following conversion, and it wasn't pretty, as the fund's AUM measured in Bitcoin has fallen by over 56% since mid-January. In fact, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) now has more BTC than Grayscale's flagship fund. Fees aside, one of the primary things that I'm looking for with these funds for long-term holding is how custody is managed. As was the case with the company's spot BTC ETF, we again see Fidelity's offering as the standout because Fidelity is self-storing its ETH through a subsidiary business. This may not matter today. But in my view, it will matter over time. I believe longer term, the Fidelity fund may become the cheapest of the bunch due to this self-stored approach. Coinbase generates most of its revenue from transaction fees. However, retail traders have been a larger driver of revenue for COIN than institutions. The latter of which is a comparatively microscopic margin. Retail volume percent (TheBlock) Despite the drastically smaller margin, we've seen Coinbase's volume growth come primarily from the institutional buyer rather than the retail buyer. Retail share of volume has fallen from roughly 70% during the first half of 2018 to just 18% in Q1-24. Coinbase is now arguably competing against these ETFs, even though it's the custodian for more than half of them. Since it's so much cheaper for retail investors to buy BTC (and now ETH as well) through the ETF products, I suspect we'll see Coinbase attempt to raise custodian fees from asset managers to make up the difference on any lost revenue from migration to ETFs rather than direct ownership. And again, Fidelity doesn't have this long-term dynamic because it's taking the self-custody approach with the assets under management. This is the biggest reason why I view FETH as the best ETH ETF for long-term 'set and forget' holder. Of course, everything has a tradeoff, and ETH ETFs are no different. Opportunity Cost There is a fundamental difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum that investors should consider before longing any ETH ETF, in my view. As a proof of work blockchain that relies on mining for transaction validation, there isn‚Äôt a mechanism for generating in-kind BTC yield directly on-chain. Thus, there is no real opportunity cost in longing BTC through the ETF rather than through self-storage. This is not the case for Ethereum, which utilizes proof of stake consensus. ETH Staking 1yr (StakingRewards) Either directly or through staking protocols, ETH holders can generate staking yield when taking custody of the asset on-chain. As currently constructed, the Ethereum spot ETFs do not stake the assets managed by the funds. This means there is an opportunity cost in longing ETH via the ETFs rather than owning and staking directly. Currently, the yield from direct-staking on Ethereum is 3.5%. It's perhaps less important to stake ETH when the asset is deflationary. However, since the Dencun upgrade, ETH has flipped back to slightly inflationary. Thus, there is theoretically purchasing power decay on-chain that is eliminated by the real yield that staking generates. Final Takeaways If an investor simply wants exposure to ETH in a tax-advantaged account, the opportunity cost from exposure to un-staked assets is far less significant and arguably nullified by the simple fact that fund shareholders won't owe taxes on staking yield or capital gains. Today, if one simply wants to buy ETH and hold for a possible rally through the end of the year, EZET is probably the best option because the fee waiver takes you through January and has an AUM limit that I highly doubt will be reached. For more long term-minded investors who just want to buy and hold, I think FETH is the best for long-term investment due to the self-custody of the asset and the ability to keep fees low even in the event third-party custodians like Coinbase decide to extract value from the ETF products.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | ICO,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4705839-fidelity-ethereum-fund-feth-my-pick-eth-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31432642.jpeg

42417613,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZHo5,1721748526,ETH ETFs: What We‚Äôre Watching For,"Exchange-traded funds tied to Ethereum's ether (ETH) could begin trading as early as Tuesday.  The debut has been much expected by traders looking for a new market ‚Äúnarrative.‚Äù But the exact impact is hard to predict. Here are four things to watch for.  Price impact?  What will the ether ETF do to the price of the underlying asset? What about the price of bitcoin? What about the rest of the cryptocurrency market?  Since the spot bitcoin ETF commenced trading in the U.S. in January, bitcoin has jumped 56% and ether 38%.  Should we expect the same type of price shock from the ether ETF? Will ether go up? Will bitcoin too? Will other cryptocurrencies follow suit?  Adoption increase?  When the ether ETF begins trading, more traditional-type investors may get price exposure to ether, but will their financial buy-in do anything to spur on adoption of the Ethereum network?  The ETFs will undoubtedly bring validity to the asset in the eyes of traditional investors. But is there a straight (or even curved) line from a financial advisor buying the ether ETF in an IRA for a client to the advisor eventually staking their ether to the advisor buying the latest and greatest ERC-20 memecoin?  I think that‚Äôs possible, but I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it as, anecdotally, I find that people care about price first, and second, and third, and foremost.  What of the SEC?  I expected cryptocurrencies to be shoved into ETFs because the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) always thought these assets were securities, and there are plenty of ETFs filled with securities. Nonetheless, the SEC has been outright combative toward crypto. Will that change with the ether ETF?  The SEC did just recently drop their case against Consensys after the Ethereum software company sued the SEC in April, alleging that the regulator was investigating whether Ethereum, post-Merge, might be a security. So maybe we‚Äôll see an environment where the SEC stops meddling. That, or maybe the ETF makes it even more clear that ether is in fact a security and SEC tightens the screws.  What is the investor base for the ether ETF?  In general, fans of Ethereum are more crypto polytheists than fans of Bitcoin are, supporting a ‚Äúmulti-chain future.‚Äù And so, while I suspect there to be overlap of investor bases for the bitcoin ETF and the ether ETF, I‚Äôm not sure what to make of the average ether ETF investor.  Are we getting family offices and hedge funds looking for asymmetric gains? Old school financial advisors looking to somehow combat inflation? Degenerate 25 year olds trying to make huge gains so they can retire early and travel the world while they still have their youth? Is this the ether ETF strictly for institutional play while retail investors will stick to holding their ether in Coinbase or Robinhood?  And who will lead the pack from the issuer side? Will BlackRock reign as the capital inflow leader with the ether ETF too?  Probably, and whether this is bad or good is a story time will tell starting Tuesday.

The latest market data shows that the token is up nearly 41% since last week. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Poised For Rally? Analyst Predicts $9.00 Breakout This is largely sustained by continuing efforts to make the network robust and usable in everyday life. Its entry into the telecommunication industry also helped carry this momentum in the long run. Helium: Mobilizing Userbase Helium‚Äôs mobile arm is the reason why HNT is at the top of its game this week. Last week, July 16, the Helium Mobile X account announced that the platform has hit the 100,000 subscriber mark. This influx of users also brought attention to the Helium network as a whole. üéä We just hit 100,000 sign-ups! üéä We want to extend a huge thank you to our community for helping us reach this insane milestone! Together, we‚Äôre innovating the telco industry üôå pic.twitter.com/Fb5lvQ1Mni ‚Äî Helium Mobile ‚òÅÔ∏èü™øü•ö (@helium_mobile) July 15, 2024 According to their website, accompanying the 100,000 users that joined up is the deployment of nearly 15,000 hotspots within the same timeframe. Helium Mobile also has a Carrier Offload program which, even though it‚Äôs still in the beta phase, has already shown some promise with over 190,192 offload subscribers. The Carrier Offload program makes it possible for non-Helium Mobile users to connect to hotspots that are part of the beta deployment. This development will help the network by slowly but surely introducing the network to the general public. Even if the Carrier Offload program is discontinued, the aggressive pricing of Helium Mobile at $20 a month will make it competitive to the average consumer, which will introduce them to the whole Helium ecosystem as a whole. Bullish? Not So Much‚Ä¶ As the market moves forward, the sudden surge in the price of HNT will eventually stall and ride the wave downwards. Long-term holders of the token will see this extreme jump as a sign to sell, and push the token down to the $4.465 support line. Related Reading: ‚ÄòEarly Signs Of Breakout‚Äô ‚Äì Solana To Explode By 900%, According To Analyst This leaves the bulls in an awkward position: either to hold or join the bearish wave and then anchor on the $4.465 line. If HNT does fall to the $4.465 line and the bulls are successful in defending this level, the $8 ceiling might be in reach. This, however, is if they are successful in defending. If the ears do win the deadlock in the next couple of days, they can bring the token down to $3 or $2. But volatility-wise, it may also help in taking the $8 line if they are lucky. Helium‚Äôs innovation within the telecommunication space will help secure the much-needed investor confidence to ride the coming wave.

According to his analysis, SOL is preparing for a mega surge to new all time highs of $1,800. Solana Sets Sight On $1,800 Price Increase In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, expressed bullish sentiment regarding Solana‚Äôs future price outlook. According to Martinez, Solana is poised for a significant price surge, potentially reaching an impressive $1,000, marking new all-time highs. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed Below $66,000, Taking Shiba Inu And Dogecoin With It The crypto analyst‚Äôs optimistic forecast for Solana is rooted in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs recent price movements. Sharing a price chart illustrating SOL‚Äôs price action from late 2023 to the end of 2024, Martinez predicted a maximum bullish surge to $1,800 for the altcoin. The analyst also based his bullish projections on early signs of an identified technical bull pennant pattern in Solana‚Äôs price chart. A bull pennant is a continuation pattern that often signals the extension of continuation of an upward trend after a period of consolidation. For Solana, this unique pattern suggests that SOL may be gearing up for a substantial bullish breakout this year. In accordance with his analysis, Martinez foresees Solana experiencing a whopping 900% rally by the end of 2024. This price surge would signal a major milestone for the cryptocurrency, considering Solana has only been able to rise as high as $259.96 in 2021. While Martinez has maintained a bullish stance on Solana‚Äôs price outlook, the analyst also cautioned that his projected surge will not happen instantly. He disclosed that the flagpole for the bull pennant pattern took about 184 days to form, during which Solana climbed from an initial price of $11 to $192. Given this gradual price progression, Martinez revealed that there will be multiple corrections or temporary price dips for SOL along its path to its $1,000 price target. One of the said corrections is expected at the breakout point of $167, suggesting that Solana may drop to this level before it can reach new highs. After this slight correction, SOL is expected to continue on a bullish upward trajectory, potentially reaching $1,000 in due time. SOL Price Analysis Solana has been on a bullish trend over the past month, steadily approaching the $200 price mark. The cryptocurrency has witnessed substantial gains, recording an increase of approximately 14.71% in the last seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Reach A New All-Time High? Crypto Analyst Reveals Why $90,000 Is Possible At the time of writing, SOL price is trading at $177.56, underscoring the cryptocurrency‚Äôs strong fundamentals amidst market volatility. In a more recent X post, Martinez disclosed that Solana‚Äôs TD sequential is now presenting a buy signal on the hourly chart. According to the indicator, this suggests that it might be a good time to purchase Solana, as the price is expected to increase soon.

Concerns exist about Grayscale's $9 billion ETH Trust potentially exerting downward pressure on the market through selling, which could counteract the positive effects of new inflows.  Ether (ETH) jumped above $3,500 ahead of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are expected to go live for trading on Tuesday, one that some onlookers say could see muted inflows in their first few weeks.  ‚ÄúMarket participants are also closely monitoring Grayscale's US$9 billion ETH Trust, as there are concerns that Grayscale's potential selling pressure could counteract the positive effects of the new inflows, potentially exerting downward pressure on the market,‚Äù wrote Vivien Wong, partner at HashKey Capital‚Äôs Liquid Funds, in a Tuesday email to CoinDesk.  Wong‚Äôs HashKey helped launch one of the Ether ETFs in Hong Kong. It estimates that inflow will hit $3 billion in the first six months of trading in the U.S., citing bitcoin‚Äôs market cap being 30% of Ether‚Äôs and the lack of staking.  Ether‚Äôs inflation rate, which increases token supply in the open market, is also a point of concern.  ‚ÄúOver the past month, the ETH supply increased by around approximately 60k ETH, contrary to expectations,‚Äù Wong said. ‚ÄúWhile the ETH supply has decreased by approximately 300k ETH since the merge, continued inflation at this rate could negate this reduction within six months, potentially turning ETH into an inflationary asset again.‚Äù  ETH reversed losses from Monday‚Äôs trading session to gain 0.57% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, outperforming the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, which fell 1.7%.  Eight issuers, including BlackRock, received approval for their latest S-1 filings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.  Market onlookers are debating if the ETFs could mirror the performance of their bitcoin counterparts, which were issued in January and have since attracted over $17 billion in net inflows.  ‚ÄúThe leading question is will ETH ETFs do better than Bitcoin ETFs? In technicality, Ethereum has more utility than Bitcoin with features like liquid staking,‚Äù shared Danny Chong, co-founder of Tranchess, in an email to CoinDesk. ‚ÄúETH ETFs were slow to live up to the industry‚Äôs expectations when launched in Hong Kong.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHowever, I do believe that with a larger investor base, ETH ETFs should be able to perform better and bring in the liquidity we require,‚Äù Chong added.  Citi wrote earlier this month that it expects approximately $5.4 billion in inflow within the first half-year, citing the lack of staking and Bitcoin‚Äôs first-mover advantage as to why it will underwhelm.

42417636,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZI6f,1721736060,First Mover Americas: Ether Little Changed After Spot ETF Approval,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk‚Äôs daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Ether was little changed after the SEC's approval for ETH ETFs in the U.S. on Monday. The second-largest cryptocurrency traded around $3,500, just 0.2% higher than 24 hours ago. Still, it outperformed the wider digital asset market, which is 1.3% lower as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20). Some analysts predict that the ETFs' listings could drive the ether price up to $6,500, though inflows are not expected to be nearly as high as for their bitcoin counterparts. Steno Research predicts that the ETFs could see $15 billion-$20 billion of inflows in the first year, the same as bitcoin ETFs have taken in in just seven months.  Bitcoin retreated after retaking $68,000 on Monday, dipping to near $66,000 in the early European morning as Mt. Gox moved its latest tranche of BTC to Bitstamp. Transfers of BTC as part of its repayments to creditors have previously led to sell-offs in the crypto market. At the time of writing, bitcoin sits just below $66,700, around 1.1% lower than 24 hours ago. In early July, Mt. Gox began repaying creditors affected by a 2014 hack. Over $9 billion worth of BTC and $73 million of bitcoin cash (BCH) will be distributed to traders in the coming months.  Citi upgraded its rating for Coinbase shares to buy from neutral and raised its price target to $345 from $260. The bank said the stock could respond positively to an improving regulatory environment as a result of November's U.S. elections and increased confidence in its legal strategy following the overturning of the Chevron Deference Doctrine by the Supreme Court. ‚ÄúWe believe the risk/reward setup for Coinbase, particularly as to its defense against the SEC lawsuit, has improved markedly in the past few weeks,‚Äù analysts led by Peter Christiansen wrote. While the stock has already risen 52% year-to-date, Citi notes that the upside opportunity from a more benign regulatory backdrop could be too large to ignore, ‚Äúpotentially unlocking sidelined institutional capital, investment, and increased crypto-native and traditional finance collaboration.‚Äù  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the weekly net inflow of XRP into wallets tied to centralized exchanges.  Last week, exchanges registered a net outflow of $94.75 million in XRP, the biggest since April.  Outflows are said to represent an investor bias for long-term holding strategy.

31423351,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631099,1721736050,XRP Rally To $0.6360 Subsides As Price Faces New Decline,"In recent trading activities, XRP has taken a significant hit in its latest attempt to rally toward its previous high of $0.6360. Despite initial bullish momentum suggesting a potential breakout, XRP could not sustain its upward trajectory. The failure to reach the anticipated target has led to a notable decline in value, raising concerns among traders and analysts about the short-term outlook for XRP. As XRP struggles with these hurdles, this article seeks to analyze its current price movement and the technical indicators suggesting a sustained drop. The goal is to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the token‚Äôs potential future trajectory. XRP was trading at $0.5974 at the time of writing, indicating a 1.13% gain. The cryptocurrency has garnered a trading volume of more than $2 billion and a market capitalization of more than $33 billion. Over the past day, XRP‚Äôs trading volume has increased by 41.17%, while its market cap has increased by 1.13%. Initial Bullish Momentum Falters On the 4-hour chart, although XRP is still actively trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), its price is currently on a bearish move towards the $0.5725 mark after failing to sustain its upward trajectory. If the digital asset continues its current bearish trend, it could drop below the $0.5725 mark. The 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator indicates that XRP may continue its bearish trajectory toward the $0.5725 mark, as the signal line is currently attempting a drop below the SMA of the indicator. If the signal line crosses below the SMA, both lines are likely to move toward the zero line, signaling a potential extended decline for the coin. On the 1-day chart, following the failure of XRP to sustain its upward trajectory to its previous high of $0.6360, the price is currently attempting a single candle bearish move toward the $0.5725 mark, trading above the 100-day SMA. This bearish momentum may drive the digital asset to reach the $0.5725 mark. Lastly, it can be observed that the signal line is currently trading in the overbought zone and is attempting to move downward toward the SMA of the indicator. This formation in the composite trend oscillator suggests that XRP‚Äôs price may continue its bearish movement toward $0.5725 before potentially starting to move upward again. Expert Insights On Crucial XRP Levels To Monitor Should the price of XRP decline to the $0.5725 mark and encounter rejection, it would likely start an upward movement toward the $0.6360 resistance mark. A successful breach above this target could potentially trigger further upward movement to test the $0.6697 resistance and beyond. Nevertheless, should XRP‚Äôs price approach the $0.5725 support range and break below, it may likely continue to move downward toward the $0.4663 support level. A further break below the $0.4663 support level might lead to a price drop toward the $0.4088 support point and other lower levels.

42417621,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZHuH,1721736019,Ethereum-Based Protocol Alkimiya Creates Market for Hedging Bitcoin Fees,"Blockchain protocol Alkimiya launched, introducing a tool that allows users to hedge against volatile Bitcoin {{BTC}} transaction fee rates.  The hardest part might be getting hardline bitcoiners ‚Äì sometimes known as ""maximalists"" or ""maxis"" ‚Äì to use the new protocol, since it's built atop the Ethereum blockchain. Target users for the platform, described as a ""blockspace markets protocol,"" could include traders, mining pools and foundations.  ""While we recognize that Bitcoin maxis may initially hesitate to use an Ethereum-based solution, our primary focus is on creating the most robust and efficient marketplace for trading Bitcoin transaction fees,"" Alkimiya founder and CEO Leo Zhang said in an email interview with CoinDesk.  There may be little doubt about the usefulness of a solution like Alkimiya's: In April, when Casey Rodarmor's Runes protocol for minting fungible tokens atop Bitcoin went live, the Bitcoin network fee rate shot up to $125 per transaction from $4.80.  Bitcoin ""mining companies, facing high operating costs, are increasingly seeking hedging instruments to protect against fee volatility,"" said Alkimiya in its press release.  The company was founded in 2021 and is backed by investors including Dragonfly, Castle Island Ventures, 1KX, GMR, Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, Tribe Capital and Robot Ventures, according to the statement. The project raised $7.2 million of funding in January 2023, and went live on a test network in April.  Designed as a peer-to-peer payments network, Bitcoin has been around since 2009 and many of its users are notoriously loyal, and skeptical of solutions not built ""natively,"" or using a secure apparatus directly atop the oldest and original blockchain.  Notably, however, Bitcoin lacks the programmability of Ethereum, which came along in 2015, founded mostly by developers, including Vitalik Buterin, who had previously worked on Bitcoin.  And like many of the decentralized applications and protocols atop Ethereum, Alkimiya's design requires some programming.  How does Alkimiya work?  Here's how Alkimiya works, according to the project's documentation: ""Alkimiya users can enter Buy and Sell positions for any pool. These Buy and Sell positions are represented by NFTs (ERC-1155) called Long and Short shares. Long shares from the same pool have the same tokenId and are fungible, while Long shares from different pools have different tokenIds and are non-fungible. The same rule applies to Short shares.""  An ERC-1155 is a standard for a ""smart-contract interface that can represent and control any number of fungible and non-fungible token types,"" according to the definition on the Ethereum Foundation's website.  Zhang, the founder, told CoinDesk that the project is ""actively monitoring"" the development of Ethereum-compatible layer-2 solutions atop the Bitcoin blockchain, as well as ""UTXO-based approaches.""  A UTXO ‚Äì short for ""unspent transaction output"" ‚Äì represents a key element of Bitcoin's architecture, radically different from Ethereum's account approach.  The reality is that many Bitcoin layer-2 solutions are still in a work in progress, especially those with Ethereum compatibility.  ""Given that we cannot currently develop on Bitcoin, developing on Ethereum is the most decentralized approach available, which aligns with our commitment to decentralization and avoiding a centralized approach,"" according to Zhang.  The goal is to eventually create ""seamless integration pathways that make it easy for Bitcoin users to access and use our platform without having to manage multiple wallets or interfaces,"" Zhang said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/07/23/ethereum-based-protocol-alkimiya-creates-market-for-hedging-bitcoin-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5630aaee8c79343f9e01fb8dd90982a77d7aa7d3-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The investment led by trillion-dollar asset manager Franklin Templeton suggests the TradFi world is taking notice as well.  Bitcoin layer-2 blockchain Bitlayer Labs said it raised $11 million in a Series A funding round at a valuation of $300 million.  The investment was led by ABCDE and Franklin Templeton, one of the issuers of a spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded fund in the U.S. The involvement of Franklin Templeton, a trillion-dollar asset manager, suggests the traditional finance (TradFi) world is taking notice of developments in decentralized finance (DeFi).  Bitlayer's layer 2 is based on the BitVM paradigm, which was unveiled last October, laying out a path for Ethereum-style smart contracts on the original blockchain. BitVM brought fresh impetus to initiatives that seek to introduce greater utility to the network through achieving Turing completeness without compromising security.  Turing completeness refers to a system having all the tools required to carry out any calculation or execute any program. Thus it suggests versatility and utility.  ‚ÄúWe believe that Bitlayer's unique approach and technology has the potential to unlock new use cases and opportunities for Bitcoin,"" Kevin Farrelly, managing principal at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, said in an emailed announcement on Tuesday.

The crypto exchange could benefit from an improving regulatory regime in the U.S., the report said.  Coinbase could also profit from a U.S. crypto catchup, the bank said.  Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) is likely to benefit from an improving regulatory regime in the U.S. after the presidential election in November and the Supreme Court‚Äôs overturning of the Chevron precedent, Citi (C) said in a research report on Tuesday upgrading the shares.  Citi raised Coinbase to buy from neutral and increased its price target to $345 from $260. The shares were little changed in the premarket, trading at around $266 at publication time.  The bank said the stock could respond positively to an improving regulatory environment as a result of the U.S. election and increased confidence in its legal strategy following the overturning of the Chevron Deference Doctrine.  ‚ÄúNotwithstanding the increased turbulence in the upcoming U.S. elections, we believe the risk/reward setup for Coinbase, particularly as to its defense against the Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) lawsuit, has improved markedly in the past few weeks,‚Äù analysts led by Peter Christiansen wrote.  The launch of spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. later Tuesday could also be a tailwind. Their introduction suggests the potential for more crypto ETFs to come to market, increased adoption of cryptocurrencies more generally and a larger custody revenue opportunity for the crypto exchange, the report said.  While the stock has already risen 52% year-to-date, Citi notes that the upside opportunity from a more benign regulatory backdrop could be too large to ignore, ‚Äúpotentially unlocking sidelined institutional capital, investment, and increased crypto-native and traditional finance collaboration.‚Äù  Coinbase could also benefit from a ‚ÄúU.S. crypto catchup‚Äù versus higher on-chain activity and liquidity that has developed abroad, the report added.

Differences in fees among ETFs are important for investors to consider. Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust fund is likely to be the most popular due to lowest fees, low share price, and strong reputation. Thesis Summary Ethereum (ETH-USD) ETFs have been approved, and nine ETFs will be available for purchase starting Tuesday the 23rd of July. Though all of these ETFs will track the Ethereum price, there will be differences between these funds that investors should take into account before investing. Fees will, of course, be the biggest factor to look at. So which ETF has the lowest fees? Which ETF will attract the most capital? And what does the ETF approval mean for Ethereum and crypto? Ethereum ETFs: Who is Entering the Race? In total, there will be nine spot Ethereum ETFs that will begin trading on Tuesday 23rd of July. These include: Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV), Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH), Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), and the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH), and also the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) which will be converted to an ETF. The wide variety of ETFs will no doubt pave the way for increased Ethereum adoption, allowing investors an easier way to gain exposure to this asset. However, with nine options to choose from, we must be diligent about finding out which the best option is. Since all of these will essentially track the performance of Ethereum, the main consideration here is fees. Fees and Waivers The list below shows us what the fees will be for each fund. Many of the funds will be waiving their fees, either completely, or partially, so this is something we must also take into account. ETH ETFs fees and waivers (ETH ETFs fees and waivers (ccn.com)) As we can see, six of the funds will initially charge no fees at all. However, these waivers are limited in terms of total assets and, most importantly, time. For the most part, fees will begin to ""normalize"" after 6-12 months. The only two funds not to offer any fee waiver will be QETH and ETHE. ETHE will actually leave its fee level unchanged and with fees of 2.5% will become the most expensive ETH ETF. Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust: Aptly Named Interestingly, while Grayscale will likely see notable outflows from its ETHE fund, which will become the least competitive of the ETFs, the company could stand to benefit from the launch of its ETH Mini Trust. This is, in fact, a ""spin-off"" from its ETHE fund, and something the company will also do with its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). But how will this work? If you possess 1,000 shares of ETHE, you will be entitled to 1,000 shares of mini ETH. Although this originates from a share point, its value is notably distinct. An individual holding $1,000 worth of ETHE or GBTC will have $900 remaining in the original fund and $100 allocated to the newly created mini ETFs following the spinoffs. Source: TokenPost In other words, upon the launch of the mini fund 1/10 of the original/large fund will be converted into the mini fund, which in turn has a value per share of 1/10 relative to the original/large fund. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust will have a 0% fee for the first $2 billion in assets, second only to iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which will have 0% fees for the first $2.5 billion in assets. Following this, however, ETH will be the fund with the lowest overall fees, at only 0.15%, with the Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ) the next best option at 0.19% Cheaper is Better If the Ethereum launch is anything like the Bitcoin ETF launch, then we should expect the funds with the lowest fees to do much better. BTC ETF comparison (Mooloo) As it stands right now, the VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF ( HODL ) has the lowest fees, though they will increase to 0.20% on April 1st, 2025. This fund has appreciated 60% since its launch and has 600 million in AUM. The ETF with the most assets and best performance is the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), with $18.58 billion in AUM. There are a couple of funds with marginally lower fees, but the iShares stands out as the best performer. iShares is a very reputable and popular ETF provider, and this has likely also helped it secure a place as the most popular BTC ETF. Ethereum ETF Impact The Ethereum ETF has been a much-awaited event, though it may actually pale in comparison to what we saw during the Bitcoin ETF launch. The crypto market maker Wintermute predicts that the Ethereum ETF will likely attract around $3.2-$4 billion in assets . With the firm expecting Bitcoin ETFs to amass roughly $32 billion before the end of the year, that means Ethereum ETFs would get only about 10% to 12.5% of the amount of assets that Bitcoin ETFs are projected to receive. Source: DL News , Wintermute report The key issue here is that Ethereum ETFs will not have a staking mechanism in place. Following Ethereum's transition to Proof-Of-Stake, Ethereum holders with sufficient funds can stake their Ethereum and receive a return on their investment ( currently a 3.2% yield). The ETFs will not have this feature in place, and will therefore be less attractive. Still, Wintermute expects the Ethereum price could rise by 18%-24% as more capital enters the asset through the ETFs. Final Thoughts In conclusion, I believe that the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust fund could become the most popular Ethereum ETF. This is based on three main reasons: It will have the lowest fees. It will have a low share price (around $3). Grayscale has a strong reputation in the crypto world. These three factors should combine to make this a very popular option. Everyone likes low fees, and the reduced share price will also help attract smaller retail investors. While Grayscale doesn't have as much of a reputation as iShares, which will likely also do very well, I still think this is the best option for investors. Finally, while this is a great step in the right direction for crypto, it may not be as significant as the Bitcoin ETF.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4705725-grayscale-ethereum-mini-trust-eth-etf-buy-big-news?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31421794.jpeg

42407804,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5rYe,1721732325,Ethereum Experienced Its Highest Inflationary Period in the Last Quarter: Fidelity,"Fidelity noted that the Ethereum network experienced its highest period of inflation in the second quarter.  Layer 2 transactions increased 20% since the Dencun upgrade in March, the report said.  Ethereum‚Äôs base layer fundamentals declined in the quarter, Fidelity said.  The Ethereum blockchain experienced its highest period of inflation in the last quarter with about 110,000 ether {{ETH}} added to the total supply, equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 0.37%, Fidelity Digital Assets said in a report last week.  ‚ÄúWhile dramatic fluctuations in ether‚Äôs supply are unlikely in the short- to medium-term, the growing preference for lower-fee layer 2 platforms and increasing staking demand suggests that inflationary quarters may become more frequent,‚Äù analysts Daniel Gray and Max Wadington wrote.  The network‚Äôs validator count has increased 5% since April, the report said, and the recent introduction of restaking could further add to staking demand.  Ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will become available for trading in the U.S. for the first time later Tuesday. While their introduction will broaden access to the cryptocurrency, some prominent firms have cautioned that initial demand for these spot ETFs could be less than expected.  Following the Dencun upgrade in the first quarter, Fidelity notes that the ‚Äúadoption of layer 2 platforms has been impressive,‚Äù with layer-2 transactions increasing around 20% and that success could be a positive indicator for the future of the Ethereum network. Layer 2s are separate blockchains built on top of the base blockchains, or layer 1s.  Ether is currently trading about 67% above its so-called realized price, which was $2,050 toward the end of the second quarter, the note said. That's the highest since inception despite the fact that ETH remains well below its 2021 highs. The realized price is a measure that tries to capture the average cost basis of all current ETH holders. Ether was trading around $3,526 at publication time.  This could indicate that ‚Äúinvestors are more comfortable allocating to ether as compared to the highs of 2021,‚Äù Fidelity said. After a strong start to the year, Fidelity notes that the Ethereum base layer's fundamentals all declined in the second quarter. Monthly new addresses dropped 16%, active addresses fell 14% and transaction counts shrank 9%.  Still, as the layer-2 ecosystem continues to flourish, the ‚Äúinfluence of layer 1 metrics on valuation is expected to diminish,‚Äù the report added.

It said that it would ""comply with laws and regulations in Japan"" and support customers who wish to transition to compliant cryptocurrency exchanges within Japan. The company's website does not show it has regulatory approval in Japan. The company is headquartered in George Town, Cayman Islands.  ""As one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, we strive to comply with financial regulations in all regions in which we operate,"" a blog on Gate.io said. ""Based on this commitment, we regret to inform you that we will be terminating our services for Japan.""  It isn't clear whether ""regulatory pressures and compliance requests"" from Japan‚Äôs Financial Services Agency (FSA) resulted in the decision but one report suggested it. Gate.io is not listed as a registered entity on the FSA website. The FSA and Gate.io did not immediately respond to CoinDesk requests for comment  As of Monday itself, the exchange will suspend the opening of new accounts for customers residing in Japan.  Other details of the schedule for the suspension of services in accordance with compliance requests from authorities such as Japan's Financial Services Agency will be announced later, the company said.  Japan's Financial Services Agency previously warned that four other crypto exchanges were operating in the country without proper registration. The Mt. Gox hack in 2014 resulted in Japan becoming one of the earliest countries worldwide to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges, with some of the strictest consumer protection legislation worldwide.

The current Vice-President needed the majority to become the Democrat frontrunner.  Market odds and memecoins related to U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris surged as the latest donation round tied to the Democratic campaign raised $81 million in 24 hours, boosting sentiment among some traders.  Odds of Harris being announced as the Democratic nominee jumped further to 90% on crypto betting application Polymarket, rising from 80% on Monday to set a new peak.  Bettors previously placed just 8% odds at the start of July, but that changed as incumbent Joe Biden announced on Saturday that he would no longer contest in the November elections. Biden later endorsed Harris as a candidate.  Polymarket traders have placed $28.6 million in bets favoring Harris, the data shows. The next favorite is Michelle Obama.  Elsewhere, Solana-based memecoin KAMA, a political meme token modeled after Harris, jumped 62% to set a new lifetime high of 2 cents at a $27 million market capitalization. The token is up a mammoth 4,000% since a June 18 low of $0.00061, buoyed mainly by Harris‚Äô possibility of becoming president.  As such, Harris has yet to publicly comment on cryptocurrencies or her strategy for the growing market. On the other hand, Republican candidate Donald Trump has expressed support for the crypto market and is scheduled to appear at the Bitcoin 2024 conference on Saturday.  Some expect Harris or the Democratic party to mention the industry in the coming weeks, however, which could impact price action.  ‚ÄúAlthough she has not yet received the official nomination, there is a consensus that last night's development aligns with the current Democratic strategy,‚Äù crypto trading firm Wintermute said in a Monday note emailed to CoinDesk. ‚ÄúIn the coming days, keep an eye on comments from Democrats regarding this issue.  ‚ÄúThe prevailing assumption is that Harris will secure the nomination, and any deviation from this expectation could cause market volatility,‚Äù the firm added.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/23/kamala-harris-memecoin-sets-new-highs-as-her-nominee-odds-surge-to-90,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/393e34c159abc92c7d78bb7921c585d0ec8b4df4-4057x2282.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Many experts have noticed LINK‚Äôs price path as current market circumstances offer a combination of volatility and stability. Under a background of restrained market movement, Chainlink‚Äôs technical patterns suggest a bright future. Related Reading: ‚ÄòEarly Signs Of Breakout‚Äô ‚Äì Solana To Explode By 900%, According To Analyst Technical Analysis Shows Promise According to new technical examinations, Chainlink is currently trading at $14.10, but a rise may be around the corner. It has been going down since it climbed recently. However, a well-known crypto expert, Ali Martinez, has seen a pattern form on the 4-hour chart that may just turn things around in LINK‚Äôs favor. #Chainlink appears to form a head-and-shoulders pattern on the 4-hour chart. A sustained close above $14.7 could send $LINK to $18.3! pic.twitter.com/v566HWIIrR ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) July 21, 2024 Usually, this pattern ‚Äì called the head and shoulders ‚Äì indicates a negative trend reversal. Martinez points out, nevertheless, a major discrepancy in this situation. There are three peaks in the head-and-shoulders configuration; the centre peak·Ö≥the head·Ö≥is tallest. The two adjancent peaks·Ö≥the shoulders·Ö≥have almost the same elevation. Usually, a decline below the neckline·Ö≥which right now is at $14.63·Ö≥would indicate a bearish change. Martinez advises, however, that Chainlink may ward off these negative consequences by keeping a price over $14.70, thereby paving the ground for a significant price rise to $18.3. Chainlink (LINK) Price Projection Based on the most recent analysis by CoinCheckup, Chainlink is selling around 90% below its projected value for next month. This notable undervaluation implies that LINK is presently going through a period of reduced price in relation to its expected future worth. Technical signs and market circumstances point to a positive future with projections of a 35% rise over the next three months. This expected increase suggests a possible trend of stabilisation and recovery. Longer-term forecasts seem much more positive. Forecasts of a 140% rise over the following six months reflect significant positive momentum and a potential recovery trend. The one-year projection of the platform supports this encouraging view even more by implying a 76% increase at the end of the year. Such forecasts highlight Chainlink‚Äôs prospects for significant appreciation, which makes it an interesting choice for those looking for long-term profits. Market Conditions And Levels Of Resistance More general market dynamics have shaped Chainlink‚Äôs recent pricing swings. Over the weekend, the market for cryptocurrencies showed modest volatility marked by a neutral candlestick development in Bitcoin. Related Reading: Terra Classic Poised For 280% Rally On ‚ÄòMajor Recovery Strength‚Äô ‚Äì Analyst The technical signs are looking positive.

As an additional point of interest, the average directional index (ADX) is decreasing and is currently at 25%, which indicates that the downward trend is beginning to slow down.

Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is trading higher before the funds hit the market, rising 1.3% to $3,520 in early trade. It was only six months ago that the first spot bitcoin ETFs came online and demand for those funds saw net cumulative inflows of more than $15.1B since they started trading on Jan. 11. Check out the real-time market data page for crypto on Seeking Alpha Backdrop: Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, which touts benefits such as smart contracts and customizable applications for DeFi. Spot ether ETFs will track the performance of the crypto as an underlying asset, making buying and reporting easier due to liquidity and transparency. The simple-to-understand product will also bring things more mainstream, and give institutional and retail investors another opportunity for crypto diversification. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink calls bitcoin 'digital gold,' says he's no longer a skeptic ""The thing that people should keep in mind is that more money into crypto and blockchain is not a rising tide that lifts all boats,"" said Paul Brody, Global Blockchain Leader at EY, citing similarities to the precious metals industry. ""Gold is $14T-$15T in market cap. That is more than 10x larger than the next largest precious metal. I think we will see the same kind of behavior in cryptocurrency."" ""Bitcoin is digital gold, and it will behave like digital gold, and it will be as dominant to other crypto assets as gold is to other precious metals. Similarly, ethereum has become the dominant kind of tokenized asset and smart contract platform. I think there will be a similar kind of effect there, where ethereum will soak up more than 90% of all these tokenized real-world assets that companies like BlackRock ( BLK ) and others are talking about deploying."" Note that the new ether ETFs won't permit staking , which gives investors a source of revenue by earning a yield on token deposits. That could weigh on future demand, with the SEC likely not interested in adding complications or further deliberations about security classifications. There are also leveraged ether-linked ETFs on the market, such as the 2x Ether ETF ( BATS: ETHU ), though there are other risks to consider there , as mentioned by SA analyst Mike Fay. Who's next? OG players bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) are more decentralized than other ecosystems - and benefit from bigger market caps and liquidity - but others are trying to break through. Late last month, VanEck became the first asset manager to file for a spot solana ( SOL-USD ) ETF in the U.S., while CBOE recently filed a request with the SEC to list ETFs tied to the cryptocurrency. It's difficult to predict where American regulators will stand on the new applications, given the current regulatory environment. Unlike other regimes, like the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) infrastructure in Europe, things boil down to individual circumstances in the U.S., with lots of time, regulatory clarity, and amendments needed to approve any new applications. Spot ether ETFs: Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( OTCQX:ETHE ), Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ( NYSEARCA: ETH ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( NYSEARCA: ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( NASDAQ: ETHA ), VanEck Ethereum Trust ( BATS: ETHV ), ARK 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF ( BATS: CETH ), Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF ( BATS: QETH ), Fidelity Ethereum Fund ( BATS: FETH ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( BATS: EZET ).

42407824,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5sSr,1721729086,Ether Options Market Bets on Price Gains Post-Spot ETF Approval,"Positioning in ether's options market counters concerns of a profit-taking-induced price drop following the ETF launch.  The absence of a pre-launch pump reduces the ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù risk, one observer said.  Ether {{ETH}} options listed on Deribit are anticipating positive price outcomes from the expected debut of spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. on Tuesday.  Data tracked by Amberdata show short-duration and long-duration call options are trading at a volatility premium to puts. That's a sign traders expect price gains immediately after the introduction and in the months ahead. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at a later date and represents a bullish bet on the market. A put, or the right to sell, indicates a bearish bet.  The bias for call options runs counter to concerns of a typical ""sell-the-fact"" price response. A sell-the-fact pullback refers to a price drop stemming from early investors taking profits on the occurrence of a highly anticipated event.  Analyst insights  The crypto market's long wait for spot ether ETFs ended Monday after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved their listings, opening the floodgates for institutional investors to invest billions of dollars in the second-largest cryptocurrency.  ""We recommend maintaining exposure to the positive momentum in cryptocurrency markets but favor bitcoin over ether, as we believe the hype and [ETF] inflows are already priced in for ether,"" Valentin Fournier, an analyst at digital assets research firm BRN, said in an email. ""We anticipate Ethereum to drop to levels between $2,800 and $3,100 before bouncing back towards $4,000 by September.""  Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, voiced a similar opinion in Tuesday's edition of the newsletter, saying, ""will take profit once the ETF launches ‚Äì if not hours before.""  There's historical precedent for those concerns. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell 20% in roughly two weeks after spot ETFs began trading on Jan. 11. The cryptocurrency's options market flipped bearish the day before, warning of a sell-the-fact pullback.  Similarly, the listings of a futures-based BTC ETF in October 2021 and CME BTC futures in December 2017 marked major bull market tops.  What the data says  The positive call-put skews show relative richness of calls.  One reason for the call bias on ether ETFs could be that the bar for expected inflows has already been set low. Crypto market maker Wintermute said Monday that inflows over the next 12 months could be 62% less than the $16 billion pulled in by bitcoin ETFs in six months. Similar forecasts by investment banks have been doing the rounds since the second quarter.  Besides, the ETH price has not experienced a significant ""buy the rumor"" surge leading up to the ETF launch, which weakens the case for a sell-the-fact adjustment. While BTC set new highs in the first quarter, ether peaked at $4,000, well short of its record high of $4,866, and was recently changing hands at $$3,525, according to CoinDesk data.  ""No pre-launch pump reduces the 'sell the news' risk,"" Ilan Solot, senior global strategist at Marex Solutions, said in an email. ""The precedent of Bitcoin‚Äôs 2-week post-ETF decline led investors to adopt a 'I‚Äôm waiting to buy on the dip' strategy for ETH. This often means the dips are shallow or don't even come.""  ""Natives remain 'underweight' ETH, in my reading, still running last cycle playbooks of altcoin/L1, which has been reasonably successful so far. This regime might be about to change,"" Solot added.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/23/ethereum-etfs-spur-sell-the-fact-concerns-yet-options-market-reflects-confidence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/091e86fa8117f84ef6ac493753d848fc0350d502-7000x4667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31416682,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631048,1721725258,XRP U-Turn: Ex-Critic Reveals 4 Reasons To Buy And A Price Target,"Crypto analyst CryptoCondom (@crypto_condom), who had previously been a vocal critic of XRP, has done a U-turn and is now endorsing the crypto asset as a potential investment to his 82,400 followers. This turnaround is rooted in an analysis of Ripple‚Äôs lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its implications for the XRP price. 4 Reasons To Be Bullish On XRP @crypto_condom, who had never envisioned investing in XRP, disclosed that his change of perspective was prompted by what he perceives as an overshoot in the recent sell-off, triggered by delays in the Ripple-SEC settlement. His analysis suggests that the resolution of this lawsuit could catalyze a series of transformative developments. ‚ÄúNever in my life did I think I‚Äôd want to own/long some XRP‚Ä¶but here we are. I think it got oversold the other day on its settlement delay. In my mind, the Ripple settlement will RAPIDLY [propel 4 reasons to be bullish on XRP],‚Äù the analyst remarked. Related Reading: XRP Adoption & Activity Spike: What This Means For Its Price Firstly, the conclusion of the lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC is expected to clarify the regulatory status of XRP, potentially allowing Ripple to resume operations at full capacity within the United States. ‚Äú[It will] permit the company to operate again in the US,‚Äù @crypto_condom claimed. Historically, despite Ripple securing over 31 money transmitter licenses across various states, the persistent legal uncertainty has significantly hampered broader institutional adoption of XRP. In the past, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse unveiled that institutions like the Bank of America are waiting on the sideline until the resolution of the lawsuit. Moreover, Ripple and MoneyGram parted ways due to SEC lawsuit. Secondly, @crypto_condom points to the potential listing of XRP futures on prominent US exchanges such as Coinbase following the lawsuit‚Äôs resolution. This would not only enhance XRP‚Äôs liquidity but also its visibility and attractiveness to a broader range of institutional investors. Furthermore, this regulated futures market of significant size could pave the way for an US based spot XRP ETF, according to the crypto analyst. ‚ÄúMAYBE allow it to get an ETF someday via a second tier issuer (has CFTC futures). As shown by the massive success of the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, this could mark a significant milestone in providing retail and institutional investors with a regulated vehicle to invest in XRP, thereby broadening its investor base. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $1.03 Soon, Warns Of Initial Dip Fourth, the prospect of a Ripple Initial Public Offering (IPO) also looms large, contingent upon a shift in the regulatory environment. @crypto_condom speculates that a potential presidential win by Donald Trump, who is perceived as more favorable towards the crypto industry, could create a regulatory climate conducive to such a move. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously noted that an IPO under the current regulatory conditions would be impractical, signaling that the company‚Äôs strategy could pivot dramatically with changes at the federal level. Price Target And Community Reactions Despite his newly minted support for XRP, @crypto_condom remains guarded about its price potential. In a spirited exchange with his followers, he tempered expectations, dismissing the possibility of XRP reaching $10 even in the most bullish scenarios, though he conceded that a climb to near $1 might be within reach. This careful optimism stands in contrast to more bullish projections within the community. For instance, a user named Nefarious boldly predicted that ‚Äú6 years accumulation will break and XRP will send $10+ easy,‚Äù a sentiment that @crypto_condom sharply refuted. He responded, ‚Äúerrr‚Ä¶$10 is not a snowballs chance in hell. Close to $1 possible though.‚Äù At press time, XRP traded at $0.5994.

Bitcoin Price Has Surged Past Final Short-Term Holder Cost Basis As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, Bitcoin has only one Realized Price of the short-term holders left to break. The ‚ÄúRealized Price‚Äù here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the average cost basis of the investors in the BTC market. Related Reading: Solana Cooling Off After 16% Surge? TD Sell Signal Goes Off Investors carry net profits when the cryptocurrency‚Äôs spot price is above this level. On the other hand, it being under the metric suggests the dominance of losses in the market. In the context of the current discussion, the Realized Price of the entire market isn‚Äôt of interest but rather that of a small segment of it. The group in question is a section of the ‚Äúshort-term holders‚Äù (STHs), broadly including the investors who bought their coins within the past six months. Below is the chart that shows the trend in the Realized Price specifically for the STHs who have been holding since between one and three months ago: This segment of the STHs sits right in the middle of the group, between the newcomers who have just bought into the asset and those who have started to gain some resilience, with a promotion into the long-term holder (LTH) group potentially coming up for them. According to the analyst, Bitcoin has already surged past the Realized price of the other two parts of the STH group, meaning that the investors falling in them would be in profits now. The chart shows that the Realized Price of the 1 month to 3 months old investors, the one level BTC is yet to break, is valued at $67,100. This cryptocurrency price is currently floating around, suggesting that this cohort‚Äôs profits are canceling their losses. Related Reading: XRP Adoption & Activity Spike: What This Means For Its Price The STH cost basis levels have historically been relevant for the cryptocurrency, as these investors, who are generally fickle-minded, are likely to show some reaction when the price retests their cost basis. In bullish periods, these investors tend to buy at their own cost, while if the atmosphere is bearish, they may sell instead. As such, a successful break above this potential resistance boundary that Bitcoin is retesting right now could indicate the presence of bullish sentiment among the STHs. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,200, up almost 6% over the past week.

42407818,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5sFd,1721721600,"Avail, Long-Awaited 'Data Availability' Blockchain Project, Launches Main Network","Avail, a blockchain ""data availability"" project spun out of Polygon in early 2023 that has raised $75 million of funding, is finally launching.  The project's main network was set to go live on Tuesday, along with a native token, AVAIL, according to a press release.  Data availability, or DA for short, is the specialty of cheaply and efficiently storing reams of transactional data produced by blockchains, such as layer-2 networks atop Ethereum. Avail joins a growing field of projects, including first-mover Celestia, that aim to capitalize on increasing demand for the service as blockchain networks grow.  ""The launch of Avail DA marks the first step in Avail‚Äôs mission to give developers the tools they need to boost blockchain scalability, enhance liquidity and provide seamless usability across any blockchain ecosystem,"" according to a press release.  The highly anticipated project, co-led by Polygon co-founder Anurag Arjun, has raised a total of $75 million of funding, from investors including Founders Fund, Dragonfly and Cyber Fund. Avail announced last December that it had reached an agreement with the Ethereum layer-2 developer StarkWare to serve as a DA provider to new applications chains. Earlier this year, the project disclosed plans for integrations with top networks Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and ZKsync.  And in February, Arjun laid out an expanded ""vision"" for Avail as a ""unification layer"" helping to connect the myriad blockchains and layer-2 ecosystems, with DA as the ""base"" along with the additional projects Nexus, described as a ""permissionless coordination hub,"" and Fusion, ""addressing the growing need for shared security.""  But there is already much competition in the DA arena. Celestia, seen as the pioneer in the space, went live last October, along with an airdrop of its native TIA token. NEAR Protocol, an alternative layer-1 smart-contracts blockchain, spun out a DA project last month called Nuffle Labs, with $13 million of funding. EigenLayer, currently seen as the top restaking project on Ethereum despite lacking functionality pitched as crucial to the entire setup, has its own solution, known as EigenDA.  In March, developers rolled out the Ethereum blockchain's native solution for storing layer-2 transactional data at a lower cost, known as proto-danksharding.  Avail claims it's ""the only chain-agnostic DA layer combining KZG commitments with data-availability sampling,"" citing two technologies that are cast as differentiators.  ""This marks a significant milestone for the blockchain community as it enables rollups to enjoy the features and benefits of Ethereum‚Äôs danksharding roadmap today,"" according to a press release.  Avail's network uses a decentralized validator set, aiming to support 1,000 validators initially, with the potential to grow to 10,000, according to the release.  The AVAIL token will be used to pay for DA fees and secure the network through staking, the project said.",POSITIVE,NEAR | TIA,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | NEAR | TIA,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/07/23/avail-long-awaited-blockchain-project-for-data-availability-launches-main-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc0303f3549ea17dc52512c3f79e4c0fcbe70ef0-6000x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It made its representations to government officials with evidence from several sources, including a think tank study that provided evidence to support a reduction in the TDS.  The industry also asked the government to establish progressive taxes on gains instead of the flat 30% rate, and allowing losses to offset gains. They have also pushed for multi-agency regulation.  ""We were hoping for some relaxation to the taxation framework on VDAs (Virtual Digital Assets) in this budget, but the absence of any announcement is not particularly disheartening, given the Govt's overall negative stance towards the sector,"" said Dilip Chenoy, Chairperson, Bharat Web3 Association, adding that they would ""continue to push for rationalization of the taxation framework.""  Notably, the government increased the long term capital gains tax from 10% to 12.5% and short term capital gains taxes from 15% to 20%. Whether this will have any impact on crypto trading is unclear.  ""The increase in Long Term Capital Gains Tax from 10% to 12.5% and Short Term Capital Gains Tax from 15% to 20% in Budget 2024 may incentivize retail investors to shift from traditional assets like securities to cryptocurrencies. While this shift is possible, it's important to note that crypto gains are taxed at a flat 30% rate, and unlike securities, losses in crypto cannot be set off against gains,"" said Rajat Mittal, a Supreme Court crypto tax counsel.  ""On the positive, abolishing the angel tax for all classes of investors will work towards bolstering the Indian startup ecosystem,"" Chenoy said. ""We look forward to more Web3 startups setting base in India, given India's immense Web3 talent and potential.""  ""CoinDCX welcomes the Finance Minister‚Äôs announcement in today‚Äôs budget regarding the abolition of the Angel tax for all classes of investors. We are confident that this will significantly bolster the Indian tech start-up ecosystem, especially in the Web3 sector,"" said Sumit Gupta, co-founder of Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX.  The budget is the first since Prime Minister Narendra Modi was elected for a third straight term. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to secure a majority in this year's election, pushing them to form a coalition government, along with the limitations that come with it.  Among other initiatives, the budget revealed financial support of Rs 26,000 crore ($3.1 billion) to go toward road projects in Bihar, one state where Modi's alliance partner is, and Rs 15,000 crore ($1.8 billion) for another partner's plans for the development of a state capital in Andhra Pradesh.  This budget is being seen as a roadmap for his vision for the next five years, one that would consider the sentiment reflected in the unexpected election results.

31412101,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630992,1721718054,"Dogwifhat (WIF)Tipped For Stardom: Analysts Expect $6 Billion Market Cap, 20-Fold Price Increase","Solana-based meme coin Dogwifhat (WIF) has seen a significant price and market capitalization surge over the past two weeks, recording a 68% increase in value during this period. WIF reached $2.81 on Monday, marking its highest monthly valuation. The token‚Äôs market cap has also experienced significant growth, nearly doubling in just one month from $1.5 billion to its current market cap of $2.8 billion. Nevertheless, experts anticipate further growth in WIF‚Äôs market capitalization, potentially resulting in the token surpassing its previous all-time highs (ATHs). Bullish Predictions For WIF After hitting an ATH of $4.83 on March 31, WIF underwent a sharp correction that lasted almost 4 months, dropping over 50% after hitting a year-low of $1.48 in June. However, crypto analyst CryptoSmith says a move above the ATH is only a matter of time. Related Reading: US Spot Ethereum ETFs Poised To Draw $1.2 Billion Monthly: Research Firm In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), CryptoSmith forecasted a significant upward move for WIF in the coming months if the current uptrend persists, predicting that before the end of the year, specifically between October and November, WIF will achieve a market capitalization of $6 billion. CryptoSmith further contends, ‚Äú$WIF will lead this ‚Äùmeme coin super cycle‚Äù to Valhalla.‚Äù Analyzing the token‚Äôs market cap of $2.8 billion and its total supply of 998,926 WIF tokens, a $6 billion market cap predicted by CryptoSmith could send the token to new highs above the $6 mark. This would be a new milestone for the dog-themed meme coin, with the possibility of surpassing the 20th largest cryptocurrency on the market by market cap, UNI, which has a market valuation of $5.9 billion at the time of writing. Potential For $28 To $56 Price Surge Supporting the optimistic outlook, market expert ‚ÄúEnguin‚Äù on X highlights the case for holding WIF and considers it a major player in the crypto space, with a market capitalization surpassing coins like Hedera‚Äôs HBAR, ATOM, VET and Optimism‚Äôs OP token. Furthermore, the expert believes three key factors contributing to WIF‚Äôs significance are its increased stability, increased liquidity through multiple exchange listings, and a ‚Äúwell-established‚Äù mindshare acting as an autonomous marketing force. Enguin further stated: Also as a fresh new CTO meme from The People‚Äôs Chain (Solana), there‚Äôs a strong narrative for it becoming the #1 dog coin for a new era of crypto users. I‚Äôm not married to this idea, but when you consider it a real possibility, a 10-20x from here is possible According to the expert‚Äôs analysis, a potential 10x surge would take the token to a staggering valuation of $28 per token, while a 20x price surge could take WIF‚Äôs price as high as $56. ‚ÄúDepending on how crazy things get, it could go even higher,‚Äù Enguin stated. Related Reading: Don‚Äôt Get Shaken Out, Analyst Says Bitcoin And Altcoins Rally Is Just Starting Interestingly, Enguin also predicts a notable growth in market capitalization, similar to CryptoSmith‚Äôs projection, believing that the meme coin has ‚Äúone of the best chances‚Äù to reach the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, which would mean growth above the $17 billion mark, similar to Toncoin‚Äôs (TON) valuation as of this writing.

The co-founders of Glassnode, known collectively as Negentrophic, shared insights on platform X, emphasizing the continuous operation of Bitcoin with the phrase, ‚ÄúBanks can be shut down, but Bitcoin never halts.‚Äù Their newly introduced metrics reinforce this sentiment, notably the ‚Äòrisk speedometer,‚Äô which points to a positive ‚Äúshort to medium-term‚Äù outlook for Bitcoin. Breaking down the components of the risk speedometer provides a clearer picture of the market‚Äôs current stance: Market Type: The stability of Bitcoin is mirrored in its current market type score of 7, consistent with the previous week and indicating less volatility compared to the 52-week average of 41. Market Risk: Currently, Bitcoin is categorized under a low-risk environment with a score of zero, showing a notable decrease from last week‚Äôs high-risk score and substantially lower than the 52-week average. Price Momentum: Although still in negative territory at -24, the price momentum shows improvement from -60 the previous week. This suggests a positive shift in market dynamics despite the current score being below the 52-week average. On-Chain Fundamentals: Scoring 54, this metric stands neutral, aligning closely with the previous week‚Äôs score and the 52-week average, indicating stable on-chain activity and hinting at potential for recovery in Bitcoin‚Äôs market. Crypto Market Current Performance Despite these promising signals, the market experienced a mild drop earlier today, with slight corrections observed among different assets. For instance, Bitcoin has dropped from its 24-hour high of $68,480 to current trading at $67,170‚Äîa 0.7% drop in the past day. Ethereum also has mirrored this slight dip in Bitcoin, with the second largest crypto by market cap dropping by 1.5% in the past day to trade at $3,461.

""This transaction marks a final chapter in the wind-down and is the best possible outcome for customers of BlockFi,"" said Mohsin Y. Meghji, Plan Administrator of BlockFi Inc.  The administrator of crypto lender BlockFi is seeking an order which would provide for final distribution to all eligible customers and unsecured creditors, it announced on Monday.  The administrator filed a report to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. The report revealed that the administrator has closed a significant transaction, which allows them to monetize $874.5 million in claims against FTX at a substantial premium to their face value.  ""This transaction marks a final chapter in the wind-down and is the best possible outcome for customers of BlockFi,"" said Mohsin Y. Meghji, Plan Administrator of BlockFi Inc. and Managing Partner of M3 Partners.  ""These recoveries on customer claims, and the timeline those recoveries will be distributed on, were unimaginable when these cases were filed in November 2022. These results, achieved through tireless efforts by various parties, are remarkable. We intend to commence the Final Customer Distribution as quickly as reasonably practicable,"" Meghji concluded.  BlockFi was among the first victims of the contagion caused by the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in early November 2022.

The potential selling pressure represents less than 1% of BTC's 24-hour trading volume.  The U.S. government transferred 58.742 bitcoin {{BTC}}, worth nearly $4 million, to Coinbase (COIN) on Monday, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence.  The transfer originated from an address labeled ""U.S. Government: Ryan Farace Seized Funds"" and identified onchain as 3B2jEBZi8fJWGEDrh6Pe7hDMaJ6iGfFtaU. The funds were seized three years ago from Ryan Farace, who was convicted in 2018 for selling Xanax pills on the dark web.  Later Ryan's father, Joseph Farace, was convicted as well for laundering and trafficking bitcoin proceeds intended for federal forfeiture. The Department of Justice eventually recovered 2,933 BTC from the father-son duo and announced its intention to liquidate holdings in January of this year.  The latest movement of funds, perhaps a move aimed at liquidation, has emptied the Ryan Farace seized funds address and represents less than 1% of bitcoin's 24-hour trading volume of over $35 billion, according to data source Coingecko.  As such, the potential liquidation of funds through Coinbase is unlikely to negatively impact the spot price significantly as the recent large sale of BTC by Germany's Saxony state did.  Saxony sold 49,858 BTC between June 19 and July 12, driving the token's spot price as low as $53,500 at one point. As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency by market value changed hands at $67,450.

ETH Dominates Inflows The report highlights Ethereum‚Äôs strong momentum recorded over the past month, with inflows reaching $45 million last week, amounting to the year for over $103 million, outpacing Solana‚Äôs inflows year-to-date (YTD). Solana, however, also witnessed inflows of $9.6 million during the same period, resulting in a YTD total of $71 million, which lags behind Ethereum‚Äôs inflows. Among other altcoins, Litecoin was the only one to receive inflows exceeding $1 million, with $2.2 million recorded last week. Related Reading: US Spot Ethereum ETFs Poised To Draw $1.2 Billion Monthly: Research Firm The report also shows that general digital asset investment products saw continued buying, with inflows totaling $1.35 billion last week, bringing the three-week inflow streak to $3.2 billion, impacting the recovery in crypto prices in recent weeks. Additionally, trading volumes of exchange-traded funds increased significantly by 45% week-on-week to $12.9 billion. However, these volumes represented only 22% of the broader crypto market volumes, indicating a relatively lower proportion. Bitcoin (BTC), on the other hand, recorded $1.27 million in inflows last week, while short-bitcoin ETPs observed outflows of $1.9 million. Notably, these outflows amounted to $44 million since March, representing 56% of the assets under management (AuM). Ethereum Prepares For ETF Breakthrough The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to fully approve spot Ethereum ETFs today, paving the way for a second cryptocurrency investment vehicle in the US that could attract billions of dollars in retail and institutional investor cash. James Seyffart, Bloomberg ETF expert, noted: What are we expecting today for the Ethereum ETFs? We expect them to begin trading tomorrow. That means we should see a bunch of filings on SEC site today that say the ETFs‚Äô prospectuses have gone ‚Äúeffective‚Äù. Likely after or around market close. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed Below $66,000, Taking Shiba Inu And Dogecoin With It Ahead of this regulatory victory for the market following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January, industry experts are speculating that the SEC‚Äôs approval of Ethereum ETFs will significantly impact the Ethereum blockchain and its decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Mark Connors, the head of global macro strategy at Onramp, a Dallas-based financial services firm, referred to Ethereum as the ‚Äúmiddle kid protocol,‚Äù highlighting the crucial test that the ETF launch represents for the DeFi ecosystem. According to Connors, the success and participation in the ETF launch on Tuesday will shed light on Ethereum‚Äôs ability to maintain its market standing and attract sustained interest, along with increased inflows and adoption, which could significantly impact its price. Despite being only a few hours away from the start of ETF trading, ETH is trading at $3,450, down 1.5% in the 24-hour time frame, supported by the $3,435 wall underneath the current price, which has prevented any further downward price action since Friday.

Some believe that Trump‚Äôs chances of winning were clear against Biden but could significantly reduce depending on the Democratic nominee. On the contrary, others seem to believe that Biden‚Äôs rejection of his nomination will be bullish for the crypto industry regardless of the nominee.

The price of Biden-inspired tokens started to drop immediately, with its leading token, Jeo Boden (BODEN), shredding nearly 60% of its price. The memecoin went from trading at $0.025 to the $0.01 price range in half an hour. BODEN further plunged in the following hours, reaching the $0.0086 support zone. This performance represents a 65% and 73% decline in the last 24 hours and seven days. The current price represents a 99.2% drop from its April all-time high (ATH) when it traded at $1.04. Additionally, the token saw a 66% market capitalization reduction since the announcement, going from $17.5 million to $5.99 million. Nonetheless, Kamala Harris-inspired tokens surged in the last 24 hours. Kamala Horris (KAMA) was the largest gainer among PolitiFi tokens in the past day. KAMA went from hovering between the $0.011-$0.019 level to the $0.025 price range in two hours, soaring 150%. The memecoin, launched in May, registers a 257% and 1,433% increase in the weekly and monthly timeframes. As of this writing, KAMA has retraced above the $0.015 mark, currently trading at $0.016.

The price is trading above $66,800 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $62,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might extend gains and trade above the $68,500 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Holds Gains Above $67K Bitcoin price extended its increase above the $66,500 and $67,000 resistance levels. BTC even spiked above the $68,000 level before the bears appeared. It seems like the bears are active near the $68,500 level. The recent high was formed near $68,240 and the price is slowly moving lower. There was a move below the $67,500 level.

The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $66,600 swing low to the $68,240 high. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $68,250 level. The first key resistance is near the $68,500 level. A clear move above the $68,500 resistance might spark another increase in the coming sessions. The next key resistance could be $68,800. The next major hurdle sits at $69,200. A close above the $69,200 resistance might push the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $70,000 resistance. Are Dips Supported In BTC?

Why Bitcoin Could Rise To As High As $90,000 RLinda mentioned in a post on TradingView that fundamental and technical preconditions support further price growth for Bitcoin, which could send its price to as high as $90,000. On the Fundamental side, she noted that the market is waiting for the Spot Ethereum ETFs launch, which would be ‚Äúanother positive lever for the cryptocurrency market.‚Äù Related Reading: Solana Leads Crypto Rally As Expectations For A Break Above $200 Grow Furthermore, RLinda stated that Donald Trump, who already affirmed his support for cryptocurrencies, is increasing his chances of being reelected. According to her, the market will react positively if he eventually wins. The crypto analyst highlighted ‚Äúother local nuances‚Äù that could propel Bitcoin to such heights. She noted that other high-ranking US politicians are reconsidering their stance on Bitcoin, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is also ‚Äúsmoothly changing its position on cryptocurrencies.‚Äù This includes SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce‚Äôs recent statement that the Commission is open to reconsidering the inclusion of staking plans for the Spot Ethereum ETFs. BTC From A Technical Perspective On the technical side, RLinda revealed that a classic bullish flag pattern is forming on Bitcoin‚Äôs daily chart. She further remarked that at the moment, there is a ‚Äúhigh probability‚Äù of Bitcoin retesting the strong resistance at $71,700 or even going higher to restest its current ATH of $73,794. She added that only after Bitcoin retests these zones will it become possible for the flagship crypto to ‚Äúfollow the formation of prerequisites for the breakout of global resistance‚Äù at $73,800. RLinda mentioned that $67,250 and $71,750 are resistance levels that Bitcoin should look to break. Meanwhile, $63,800 and $59,300 are support levels that the flagship must remain above. Related Reading: Crypto Market Rebounds From Lows, But Why Are Cardano Holders Suffering Losses? Furthermore, RLinda revealed that Bitcoin‚Äôs current price range is favorable for a resistance breakout, which she claimed will ‚Äúopen a new way to the nearest resistance.‚Äù In the short term, she expects Bitcoin to break out from the $67,250 resistance level and experience further growth to between $71,700 and $73,800. With Bitcoin already retesting the $67,250 resistance level, RLinda provided an update on her trade idea. She highlighted a cup-and-handle pattern on Bitcoin‚Äôs weekly timeframe. The crypto analyst stated that this bullish pattern is in the last stage of ‚Äúits formation before realization.‚Äù From the chart she shared, this cup-and-handle formation supports a potential price surge to $90,000 for Bitcoin.

31397469,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630959,1721694611,Last Week‚Äôs Crypto Inflows Surge to $1.35 Billion: Which Digital Asset Led the Charge?,"The global crypto investment market has witnessed a significant influx of capital, with recent reports indicating a continued positive trend in inflows. According to the latest data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products have seen an additional $1.35 billion in net inflows last week. This recent injection of funds has brought the total for the current positive streak to $3.2 billion. The fact that money has been flowing to this extent is a testament to the amount of steam behind recent market sentiment and confidence among investors regarding cryptocurrencies. According to Coinshares, this inflow trend is not isolated to one particular cryptocurrency but is rather widespread across various digital assets. The report reveals that major asset managers such as Ark Invest, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares have all reported substantial inflows. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed Below $66,000, Taking Shiba Inu And Dogecoin With It Which Crypto Asset Led The Charge? Unsurprisingly, most investments still flow into Bitcoin, with decent contributions from Ethereum and other altcoins. According to the report, Bitcoin registered roughly $1.27 billion of inflows last week, with short-Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) seeing further outflows of $1.9 million, bringing outflows since March to US$44 million. Notably, the transaction volume spurred so far has contributed to a 45% week-over-week increase in ETP trading volumes, representing 22% of the broader crypto market‚Äôs total trading volumes. Aside¬†from Bitcoin‚Äôs continuous dominance,¬†Ethereum‚Äôs recent performance relative to other altcoins has also been noteworthy. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, noted a turning point in investor portfolio allocation, with Ethereum overtaking Solana for net inflows year-to-date. Butterfill noted: The outlook for Ethereum seems to have turned a corner, seeing a further US$45m of inflows last week, overtaking Solana for the altcoin with the most inflows year-to-date (YTD) at US$103m. Solana also saw inflows last week totalling US$9.6m, but now lags Ethereum with US$71m inflows YTD. This change can be seen as important since it suggests a larger market rotation where investors may be re-aligning their portfolios with Ethereum as it continues to see potential strong long-term growth prospects, such as the upcoming launch of its spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Furthermore, investment flows have also varied significantly across regions. While the US and Switzerland top the table by a margin, there were only small net outflows from Brazil and Hong Kong. Market Performance Over The Past Week While the crypto market fund flows have been positive in the past week, the global price performance also appears to have mirrored this positiveness.¬†Over the past week, the global crypto market valuation has surged from $2.4 trillion to $2.6 trillion. This increase comes against the backdrop of Bitcoin seeing a notable recovery that brought its price to trade as high as above $68,000 earlier today before now trading below $67,000¬†at the time of writing. Ethereum and Solana, on the other hand, have also managed to see a recovery in price, just like Bitcoin. Interestingly, although Ethereum seems to be overtaking Solana in fund flows, SOL refuses to accept defeat regarding price performance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retraces To $66,736: Can Bulls Stage A Recovery?
