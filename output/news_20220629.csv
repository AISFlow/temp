42374424,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZS6L,1656547096,Coinbase Is Reportedly Selling Geolocation Data to ICE,"Crypto exchange Coinbase's (COIN) analytics program, Coinbase Tracer, will provide the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) with data about crypto users, including “historical geo tracking data” and transaction history, according to a contract obtained by watchdog group Tech Inquiry.  The contract adds detail to what was previously known about the three-year deal between the crypto exchange and ICE, the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Intercept initially reported the news.  A representative for Coinbase denied that the information provided by the analytics software is the exchange’s customer data.  “All Coinbase Tracer features use data that is fully sourced from online, publicly available data, and do not include any personally identifiable information for anyone, or any proprietary Coinbase user data,” the spokesperson told CoinDesk.  The deal, which was signed in September for a maximum $1.37 million, is one of several small contracts between Coinbase and U.S. government agencies. In August 2021, Coinbase signed a smaller contract with ICE worth $29,000 to provide the agency with licenses for its analytics software. In April 2021 and May 2020, Coinbase sold licenses – both initially under $50,000 – from Coinbase Tracer to the U.S. Secret Service.  Coinbase Tracer, formerly known as Coinbase Analytics, has faced controversy before. The branch of the exchange responsible for the software’s development emerged from Coinbase’s 2019 acquisition of blockchain intelligence firm Neutrino, whose executive team previously worked with a startup that sold spyware to several governments, including Saudi Arabia, known for human rights abuses.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/29/coinbase-is-reportedly-selling-geo-location-data-to-ice,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2765cade265f9d99e877cf5f98b9b1a799ba06bc-1221x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422158,r2LAFyEJPPW5TW9PoT4tod,1656546000,Genesis Faces ‘Hundreds of Millions’ in Losses as 3AC Exposure Swamps Crypto Lenders: Sources,"Cryptocurrency market maker and lending firm Genesis Trading is facing potential losses into the “hundreds of millions,” according to three people familiar with the matter.  The losses at Genesis relate, in part, to exposure to over-leveraged hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance, and are on the order of “a few hundred million dollars,” one of the people said.  The losses come as the collapse of Three Arrows Capital sends shockwaves across the crypto lending industry, with numerous firms facing substantial losses from their exposure to the fund.  The precise tally of Genesis’s losses may not be known for some time because the company is seeking at least partial repayment from its counterparties and some of the losses may have been offset by hedging, the people said. Amid such uncertainty, Genesis has been pulling credit lines from counterparties left and right, according to a fourth market source.  Genesis, which is owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), also the owner of CoinDesk, issued the following statement from CEO Michael Moro:  ""As we already stated on June 17, we mitigated our losses with a large counterparty who failed to meet a margin call to us. We sold collateral, hedged our downside and moved on. Our business continues to operate normally and we are meeting all of our clients' needs.""  Neither Babel Finance nor Three Arrows Capital responded to requests for comment.  A cascade of liquidations at many different crypto lending and trading platforms has followed the high-profile unraveling of crypto firms such as Terraform Labs (of Terra and luna infamy), Celsius and Three Arrows Capital, aided by a plunge in the value of cryptocurrencies across the board.  The impact from Three Arrows Capital in particular has been felt widely. Crypto brokerage Voyager saw its stock plunge and was forced to limit withdrawals as it declared the hedge fund in default on loans worth around $670 million. Others, including BlockFi, are believed to be facing similar challenges.  Genesis has previously acknowledged taking a hit in the bear market without giving any numbers. The firm “carefully and thoughtfully mitigated our losses with a large counterparty who failed to meet a margin call to us,” CEO Moro tweeted in mid-June.  Genesis originated over $44.3 billion in loans in the first quarter of 2022. Its parent company, DCG, a large crypto conglomerate rumored to have a war chest of about $1 billion, is likely to help Genesis “buffer that kind of shock,” one person said.  Other crypto lenders have enlisted deep-pocketed saviors in recent days, with FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried making opportunistic investments in BlockFi and Voyager.  Forced deleveraging across markets has further tanked bitcoin’s (BTC) price in recent days with the leading cryptocurrency currently trading hands around $20,000.

The attack drained the service, which enables crypto assets to be traded between the Harmony blockchain and other blockchains, of $100 million worth of crypto, including ether (ETH), tether (USDT) and wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) on the morning of June 24.  North Korean hackers have grown increasingly sophisticated; in 2021 they stole an estimated $400 million, mostly in ether. The total for 2022 has already far surpassed that figure.  According to Elliptic, the attackers converted the stolen assets to 85,837 ETH following the hack and, beginning on June 27, began to send some of the ETH through Tornado Cash, a mixer commonly used to launder illegally obtained crypto. So far, approximately 35,000 ETH – 41% of the total funds stolen – have been sent to Tornado Cash.  The Harmony Bridge hack is consistent with other hacks attributed to the Lazarus Group, including the $635 million Ronin Bridge hack in March, which was possibly the largest hack in the history of decentralized finance (DeFi).  Elliptic’s analysis also highlights other factors in the Harmony Bridge hack that point to the Lazarus Group, including the automated deposits into Tornado Cash that mimic programmatic laundering of the Ronin Bridge funds, as well as the timing of the theft, which correlates with Asia-Pacific (APAC) nighttime hours.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | USDT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/29/north-korean-hacking-group-behind-100m-horizon-bridge-hack-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15b97714e22f8c27a6b05f13c1b9a3b33541e997-4676x3507.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394035,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bucifJ,1656538672,‘I Don't Follow Trends’: Multicoin’s Kyle Samani on How to Make It in Crypto,"If an entrepreneur was to call at 9 p.m., Kyle Samani, the co-founder of Multicoin Capital, would pick up the phone. Thankfully, even during this period of market routs, liquidity crises and unpredictable volatility, none of his portfolio companies has had to call.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.  “Our portfolio companies are very well-capitalized. I'm not worried about"" trouble, Samani told CoinDesk.  Samani is known in crypto for his bold personality, his unwavering bets and his Austin, Texas, crypto investment company's returns. Founded in 2017, this is a company that told investors in 2021 that its hedge fund assets have soared 20,287% since inception.  He also thinks big about the digital asset industry: Not only will crypto succeed, he asserts, the market is approaching “a multicoin world.” His company backed the Solana blockchain in a pre-seed round in 2019 as well as Helium, the blockchain-powered internet, and Arweave, which is decentralizing file storage.  However, the bets don’t always pay off. Multicoin lost nearly 95% of its investment in a non-fungible token (NFT) project called ""Loot"" this year. It was created by Vine founder Dom Hofmann and was meant to support a yet-to-be-built NFT-based, text-based game. For a weekend or so it was a fast-selling NFT project – before people realized it was actually more of a flash in the pan.  ""It is extremely important to be OK losing money,” Samani said. “People who are worried about losing money will underperform. We outperform everyone because we are OK with losing.”  Samani, who started investing in crypto in 2017, said he hates trends and that following them is not a very good ""mental model” to think about the world. Multicoin has become successful because it ignores what everyone else is doing, he added.  ""Everyone else told us to sell Solana and buy Ethereum,"" Samani said, discussing what is likely one of the New York University graduate’s most-profitable investments.  CoinDesk spoke to Samani for our “How to Make It” series during the “Future of Work Week.” Apparently, ""long-term oriented"" people could make it in crypto. And if you need a tip, ""do not look at the price,"" Samani said.  See also: 'We Want to Make Things Differently': Laura Shin on Crypto and Work  This conversation has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.  What is your typical day like as an investor in tokens?  I spend most of my day reading or talking with entrepreneurs who are building in the space or, obviously, doing due diligence if we were interested in something. And so digging into some concepts further.  Do you ever feel regret over investing in some projects? Like LOOT?  No, I don't care. It's OK to lose money. It is extremely important to be OK losing money. People who are worried about losing money will underperform. We outperform everyone because we are OK losing money.  As a co-founder of Multicoin Capital, what do you see as the latest trend in crypto now?  I don't know. I don't follow trends.  So what are you looking at?  I'm looking at first order changes and how you can use tokens to reshape sectors of the economy. Everything we look at should be happening before it is a trend. If it's already a trend, I am probably not interested in it. I hate trends. Trends, as a mental model, are not a useful way to think about the world.  What's the difference between Web2 mindset and Web3 mindset?  There's a lot of differences, but one of the most important ones is the belief that you want to empower others to contribute and to grow wealth in line with the success of the overall thesis. I think that's very important. Helium is the best example of this. I mean Helium helped a lot of other people build wealth and those people were core to the success of Helium.  What was your turning point from being interested in Web2 to Web3?  In 2017 probably – I decided to work full time in crypto. I realized I was spending 40 hours a week reading about crypto on the internet. If I'm getting to the point where I'm spending 40 hours a week on this, I should probably turn this into a job not just a hobby. I realized crypto is going to change a lot of things and social structures.  You once mentioned a rule at Multicoin Capital – if someone calls you Friday at 9 p.m., you answer the phone. Who, if anyone, is calling you at 9 p.m. nowadays.  None of our portfolio founders have called us at 9 p.m. in the last few months now.  Why did you come up with that rule?  The rule is important because if and when things are going wrong, that's when we need to be supporting our portfolio founders. Typically, things go wrong in inconvenient times – there's just a way that tends to happen. I tell our investment team, “Hey, you need to love this so much that when the guy calls you, you're going to answer the phone Friday at 9 p.m.” I think it is a very important bar. We care about our founders, we work with them during the week and we don't like being passive investors.  What kind of projects will survive the so-called crypto winter?  Our portfolio companies are very well capitalized. I'm not worried about it. I don't care about people who we’re not invested in.  What kind of project will attract your interest?  Everything that's differentiated and unique. We are not sector-specific investors. We invest across [decentralized finance], NFTs, games, consensus algorithms, data [decentralized autonomous organizations], consumer social. We invest in every sector. As long as an entrepreneur has a unique view on how that sector is evolving, then we're excited.  Considering you’ve invested since 2017, what type of people ""make it"" in crypto?  You need to be long-term oriented. That hasn't changed. The thing that's changed most about founders is, as a lot of the core technical problems are being solved the next generation of founders are not what I would call crypto natives. The founders [early to crypto] were curious. They learned about it. They realized, “Hey, I can do something cool with this.” But they never want to become what I'll call “crypto native.” That's kind of a new class of founder. And we're very excited about a lot of those guys because those are the founders who are going to take crypto into real world industries.  What advice would you give to someone trying to make it in crypto?  Do not look at the price. The single most important thing you can do is not look at the price.  I talked with Laura Shin. And she mentioned you in the interview. And she said there's no set way to do all these things in crypto. What’s your opinion?  I very strongly agree. Multicoin has become successful because we ignore what everyone else told us to [do]. Everyone else told us to sell Solana and buy Ethereum.  How did you make that decision?  I don't think Ethereum after seven years has a real scaling strategy. I have believed that for quite some time. It is now June 2022. I still believe that. It took a lot of conviction to say the number one market share smart contract platform is fundamentally broken, and they do not have a plan. Saying that publicly made a lot of people very angry.  See also: Reminder: The Merge Won't Solve Ethereum's Scaling Woes  I asked them to give me data and evidence to counter my theory. They were unable to do so. They were therefore lying to themselves. And we called everyone out. And we said no, we're gonna hold our SOL. We bought a lot more. And we held it. And it was one of the greatest venture investments of all time. You have to be willing to ignore what other people say.  You need to do what you believe is right. You need to reason from first principles, other people's opinions do not matter. That is extremely important.  In your opinion, will crypto fundamentally change how we work?  Absolutely, I'm not doing this 100 hours a week because it's a side hobby. I think crypto is going to change the nature of software and the internet as we know it.

42422164,r2LAFyEJPPW5TW9PoT4tvk,1656537219,"Meet ‘Frequency,’ Polkadot’s New Decentralized Social Media Parachain","The Polkadot ecosystem will soon have a parachain dedicated to decentralized social media named “Frequency,” the team behind the protocol said Wednesday at Polkadot Decoded, its annual community event.  Frequency, the first implementation of The Decentralized Social Network Protocol (DSNP), had already selected the Polkadot ecosystem as a home. It is probably best known as the protocol underpinning real estate billionaire Frank McCourt’s Project Liberty.  Project Liberty, which has some $250 million in backing from McCourt, aims to ""democratize"" social media by developing a publicly accessible database of people’s social connections and challenging the power of social media giants and surveillance capitalism.  Decentralizing social media  With the rise of the metaverse, the idea of decentralized social media – where a user’s content and social graph is not controlled by a single company – has gathered pace. The likes of former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey and decentralized finance platform Aave have been talking up the potential.  But balancing blockchain-based incentive models with the scale needed for social media is a challenge. As it happens, Polkadot offers an elegant solution to the problem, said Harry Evans, chief technology officer at Unfinished Labs, the builder of the Frequency chain. This is because the Polkadot model of a relay chain and connected parachains comes with a fixed price consensus.  Parachains don’t pay a separate fee for each block that gets validated because this is all accounted for in the cost of the parachain lease. Parachain leases have been settled via funds gathered from the Polkadot community and slot auctions, a process Frequency has started, Evans said.  Read more: Polkadot Parachains Go Live, Capping Yearslong Tech Build for Ambitious Blockchain Project  “For applications like social networking, where you are extremely cost sensitive, it gives you this capability to really sort of manage costs and figure out how those are allocated in a way that is much more difficult in other blockchain ecosystems,” Evans said in an interview.  Rather than charging transaction fees to send messages, Frequency uses a token staking model that earns “capacity,” Evans explained, a renewable resource that gets refilled every number of blocks. In terms of addressing scalability, messages can be batched in channels similar to layer two companion systems, while being anchored to the main chain, he added.  Frequency (and DSNP) creator Braxton Woodham said people staking tokens to support the network creates potential for interesting models down the line.  “It allows users to vote with their pocketbooks for different applications that are more effective and better for society,” Woodham said. “It also allows for a level of transparency that avoids some of the toxic outcomes that we’ve seen in the current web.”  Edit note: Thursday, June 30, 2022 3:24 UTC: Second paragraph was corrected to define Frequency as an implementation of DSNP.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/29/meet-frequency-polkadots-new-decentralized-social-media-parachain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7d126d3ec78bee354b95495a572a8390abbbd77-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In May, the FCA hosted its first two-day CryptoSprint, where 184 industry participants from the U.K. and other countries gathered to hear the FCA's thoughts on how the industry should be regulated. Suggestions made by industry representatives – which included company executives, compliance officers and lawyers – were published on the FCA's website on Wednesday.  According to the report, some participants thought that DeFi, which describes a range of blockchain-powered financial applications designed to cut out intermediaries and centralized institutions such as banks, shouldn't be regulated because of the philosophy behind its creation.  Regulators, however, have been watching DeFi lending platforms like Celsius Network closely after it seemingly folded under pressure from the recent crypto markets downturn.  Other ideas that were raised at the CryptoSprint included using the public ledgers that underlie some cryptocurrency networks to regulate crypto markets and setting up international definitions for crypto assets.  Officials from the FCA who attended the forum included Nikhil Rathi, CEO of the regulator, David Raw, co-director of consumer and retail policy, and Jessica Rusu, chief data, information and intelligence officer.  The FCA hosted CryptoSprint as a way to engage the industry. It hasn't made any promises to create or modify regulations based on what was suggested, but for many in the U.K. crypto industry, the initiative signaled the FCA was finally starting to listen.

Crypto Derivatives Exchange Bybit to Settle Options Contracts in USDC  By Jimmy He  Crypto derivatives exchange Bybit said it is offering options contract settlement using USD coin (USDC).

Bybit’s choice to use USDC for contracts because of its stability unfolds despite increasing doubts about stablecoins. In May, Terra's UST, then the third-largest stablecoin by market cap, crashed to nearly zero from its dollar peg. Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin, lost $10 billion in market capitalization the same month when investors started to redeem the tokens.

The economist warned about stablecoins&apos; cross-currency settlement risk, as they flow within minutes among buyers and sellers, but the assets that back those &apos;stable&apos; coins take at least one day to settle. Hanke looked back to 1974 when the Herstatt Bank in Germany went bankrupt &apos;in between the time they received the Deutsche marks and the payment that was to be made in U.S. dollars,&apos; he said, as quoted by Yahoo Finance UK. In turn, the bank&apos;s counterparties never received those dollars due to time lags.

42421510,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWDt,1656533329,Why the Crypto Unwind Wasn’t Contagious (This Time),"In January, as crypto and equity markets were beginning a slow, steady decline, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a report warning that crypto was becoming more intertwined with conventional markets. The report’s writers worried that “widespread adoption [of cryptocurrency] could pose financial stability risks.”  That is, a major crypto crash could have impacts on mainstream banking, equity or credit markets, in much the same way the collapse of real estate-backed instruments froze markets in the 2008 Great Recession. In particular, the IMF warned that “the rising use of leverage” in trading tokens increased the chances of systemic contagion.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  While I’m no fan of the IMF as a political organ, its analysts correctly spotted the risk. In fact, we learned from a report Wednesday the formerly huge crypto fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) is insolvent and will be liquidated, ultimately due to its margin-driven trading strategy. That sort of high-risk, leverage-driven mindset is common across crypto, contributing at least as much instability as uncertainty about the fundamental usefulness of the technology.  As it happened, though, the real world didn’t give us a chance to test crypto’s contagiousness.  Instead, crypto and other financial markets have been simultaneously driven down by the same set of external factors, above all by rising global inflation and monetary tightening in the United States. Equity markets and consumer confidence have declined alongside crypto market values, and many speculative tech stocks that experienced huge run-ups during the coronavirus pandemic have lost as much or more value in percentage terms as top-tier crypto assets over the past six months.  But even if it’s somewhat academic, the question of contagion is important. Because the waves of interest from the general public peak higher every cycle, there’s more notional money on the line. The biggest x-factor of crypto contagion may be direct Main Street exposure to speculative, volatile and risky crypto assets. That could portend entirely new macroeconomic dynamics in future crises, since more risk devolves towards individuals and away from institutions.  See also: OCC: 'No Contagion' Post-Terra Collapse  At the same time, every cycle seems to create more integration between crypto and mainstream finance. Not too long ago, remember, crypto companies had trouble even getting a bank account. Now some regulated banks actively cater to the industry.  That growing integration means a 3AC-style blowup could one day hit a traditional financial (TradFi) entity. There was a hint of that this time around as TradFi firm Jump Trading launched a crypto arm, only to make a series of misguided moves including backing the fundamentally flawed Terra system. So far, that doesn’t seem to have mortally wounded the Jump mothership, but it’s a likely preview of screwups to come.  Your size is size  But “contagion” doesn’t refer to the interdependencies of one or even a few big funds and institutions. “Contagion” implies a thick weave of counterparty relationships across the world of finance. Crypto is certainly nearing a scale where it would have that kind of pull.  At its peak last November, the total paper value of all crypto assets was roughly $3 trillion. That’s not much compared to, say, the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $23 trillion each year, or global GDP of about $83 trillion. But it starts to look more significant relative to finance in general: At that November peak, the IMF found the total crypto market cap was nearly 5% the value of U.S. equity markets. It was also over 5% of the $53 trillion in outstanding bonds in the U.S. market.  That’s more than enough to trigger a serious financial crisis. For comparison, the total value of collateralized debt obligations before the 2008 recession was a reported $200 billion, or around $273 billion in 2022 dollars. Because CDOs were highly leveraged instruments, that was enough to trigger a near-complete breakdown of credit markets when the underlying real estate market wobbled.  Venture risks  The crypto ecosystem also includes venture capital (VC) funds, but those are practically insignificant relative to the broader economy in both scale and interdependencies. In 2021, a year that saw unmatched crypto hype, VCs bet only $33 billion on crypto startups. That’s significant relative to the $276 billion VCs gave to the broader tech and software sector, but it could go to zero with no meaningful effect on the broader economy.  That’s particularly true because venture capital is insulated from the broader finance industry in particular ways. Most funds only accept capital from high-net-worth individuals, who can absorb losses without drastically altering their economic behavior. Equally important is their minimal role beyond startup funding: If a standard VC fund fails, that cuts off a pipeline to emerging industries but it doesn’t drain the entire economic lake.  The interdependencies of 3AC  Three Arrows, it is increasingly clear, was doing a lot of different things at the same time, increasing the impact of its insolvency. It was acting as a proprietary trading operation – making extremely risky leveraged long bets on bitcoin (BTC), for instance – and also as a venture fund taking positions in startups.  See also: Crypto Jobs: Who's Cutting and Hiring?  Worst of all, 3AC acted as a treasury custodian for some of the startups it backed, and allegedly offered financial incentives to portfolio companies that used the service. This was foolish in its own right, but there are further suspicions that 3AC was using startup treasuries as capital or collateral for trading activities.  Those choices have, in turn, led to genuine financial contagion within crypto markets, including tragic rugpulls for a number of startups that had funds custodied with 3AC. More to the point, though, 3AC set the market up for a wave of forced sales of bitcoin, ether (ETH) and similar blue-chip assets, threatening not just individual companies but the entire market.

42422152,r2LAFyEJPPW5TW9PoT4tgV,1656532682,Nansen Report Shows Links Between Terra Collapse and stETH 'De-peg',"A report released Wednesday by blockchain research firm Nansen draws a straight line from Terra to the sinking price of lido staked ether (stETH). The report also zooms in on Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and Celsius for their dual roles as both catalysts and casualties for the broader crypto market decline.  As crypto markets tumble and firms like Three Arrows Capital and Celsius appear on the brink of insolvency, all eyes have shifted to stETH, a derivative token of ether (ETH). Until recently, both had traded at around the same price.  Widely publicized stETH sales by 3AC, Celsius and others, however, played a role in pushing stETH’s price sizably below that of ETH. At press time, stETH traded at a 4% discount to ETH, according to CoinMarketCap.  In its report, Nansen contends that the seeds of stETH’s decline were planted long before the wider crypto market crash in early June. Nansen’s analysis shows how the stETH “de-peg” can be traced back to the implosion of the Terra stablecoin ecosystem at the start of May.  In pinning stETH’s collapse on Terra, the report painted the ill-fated stablecoin project – whose UST and Luna token crashes wiped out $40 billion back in May – as ""patient zero"" for a crypto contagion that continues to wreak havoc across sector balance sheets.  Patient zero: Terra  Lido staked ether, which represents ether “staked” on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake Beacon Chain, has become a key tool underlying the budding decentralized financial ecosystem (DeFi). It enables users to earn rewards for helping to secure Ethereum’s Beacon Chain – which will soon merge with the network’s main network – without losing the ability to trade ether (ETH).  “Although the talks about stETH 'de-pegging' have been most present recently, the groundwork for the current situation was laid around one month earlier – during the UST collapse,” said Nansen.  When Terra’s UST stablecoin was still priced at $1, a popular investment strategy involved moving stETH over to Terra’s blockchain using Wormhole, a popular “bridge” for moving assets between chains. Once the stETH was on Terra, it was represented by a derivative token called bETH, which could be deposited into a lending platform called Anchor in order to borrow UST.  This stETH-to-UST transmutation strategy was working well enough until UST’s price started to falter. As investor confidence in Terra dipped, Anchor users rushed to claw their bETH out of the platform. From there, they bridged the Terra-based bETH back to Ethereum and converted it back to stETH.  As Nansen explained in its report: “From May 7, Wormhole's bETH holdings fell from a peak of 667k to 32k within four days - a 95% drawdown. Similarly, Anchor's vault also experienced an abrupt fall of over 96% from its high of 665k stETH to 26k stETH. This reduction is analogous to flows from Terra to Ethereum, as investors were immediately unwrapping their bETH for stETH after bridging back.”  From here, Nansen says many users opted to sell their stETH back for ETH, which had the effect of depressing stETH’s price. Most stETH sellers, according to Nansen, dropped their tokens onto Curve – a stablecoin-focused decentralized exchange (DEX). “The net stETH buy/sell during this period reveals that a net cumulative of over 169k stETH were sold on DEXs (primarily on Curve),” Nansen recounted.  The massive inflows of stETH and outflows of ETH from Curve ended up crashing stETH’s price on its largest money market.  Celsius and 3AC  Nansen pointed to Celsius and Three Arrows Capital as the two firms likely to have had the largest impact on decreasing stETH’s price in the days following Terra’s collapse. Their main effect came from decreasing the number of tokens in Curve liquidity pools – buckets of currencies that decentralized exchanges use to facilitate swaps between tokens.  Nansen: “On May 12, Three Arrows Capital removed $400m of liquidity (128k stETH + 73k ETH) from the stETH/ETH Curve pool in a single transaction. Meanwhile, Celsius took out $380m of liquidity on the same day in three separate transactions.”  Shrinking liquidity pools can contribute to something called “slippage,” which can make large DEX trades prohibitively expensive. With Curve as the primary market for stETH, Nansen said 3AC’s and Celsius’ withdrawals made it difficult for others to exit their positions due to slippage and skewed stETH’s price.  “Other participants were also observed withdrawing liquidity, but these two entities were most consequential to the pool's health,” the report said.  While they may have contributed to stETH’s price dip, Nansen’s said Celsius and Three Arrows also suffered immensely as a result of stETH’s persistent price discount – especially as the broader crypto market collapsed at the start of June.  Celsius, a crypto lender that was at one point a major investor in Terra, has paused customer withdrawals and, according to the The Wall Street Journal, is now facing potential bankruptcy due to a series of failed DeFi bets.  “Given the poor market backdrop post-Terra’s collapse, both pool imbalance and liquidity on Curve for stETH failed to recover; the drying up of liquidity meant that there was no other avenue for significant stETH holders such as Celsius to cover their positions, culminating in the widely publicized events that occurred on June 11-13,” Nansen said.  Three Arrows Capital also invested in Terra and was once a darling in DeFi investor circles. It became a pariah this month after failing to pay back creditors – apparently due to questionable risk management practices. On Wednesday, CoinDesk reported that a British Virgin Islands court is forcing the firm into liquidation.  According to Nansen, “3AC’s lack of sound risk management coupled with excessive leverage was simply a ticking time bomb that was set off by the stETH ‘de-peg.’”  Celsius and 3AC are just the latest (and most prominent) casualties in the recent crypto decline. Should stETH’s price continue to fall, one should expect to see far more knock-on effects.  Aave  In its report, Nansen said that a number of traders have engaged in high-leverage strategies built atop the assumption that ETH and stETH will trade 1:1.  One popular strategy involves borrowing ETH against stETH on the DeFi lending platform Aave, staking that ETH in exchange for more stETH, and then depositing that new stETH into Aave, and then continually repeating the process. This popular strategy increases the rewards one can receive for staking ether, but it also increases one’s exposure to stETH in the event of a price decline.  As Nansen explains, “The tradeoff is the build-up of leveraged positions which can be liquidated if stETH trades at a significant discount against ETH, putting the stETH at risk of a potential liquidation cascade when there is enough selling pressure. Once the selling pressure starts to mount, more users will have to sell their stETH to cover their positions, further exacerbating the sell pressure.”",NEGATIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/29/nansen-casts-blame-for-steth-de-peg-on-terra,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d24ad1c2d083341b4670795d40c395ee782beb8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We have taken up a total of 453 ad complaints related to Virtual Digital Assets till now (January 2022 to May 2022). Of them, 447 relate to influencers. Out of the total 453 ads that we examined, 419 required modifications, which were duly informed to the influencers,"" said Manisha Kapoor, the ad council's CEO, in an email to CoinDesk.  In India, box office film stars and international cricketers are seen as celebrities, while those broadcasting on YouTube channels or reaching considerable followings via Instagram are considered to be influencers.  ASCI said that ""most of the influencer ads were a mix of breaching ASCI’s influencer guidelines and crypto guidelines in advertising."" Some of the ads are still being changed to comply with the law but the overall compliance rate at this point is 77%.  Recently, some of India's biggest film stars, including Amitabh Bachchan, Ranveer Singh and Salman Khan, have become associated with crypto exchanges through promotions or advertisements during India's most-watched events such as the Indian Premier League, the fast-paced cricket tournament that grips the attention of most of the country for a few weeks every year.  Last year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi led a government meeting about crypto in which a consensus was reached to stop ""attempts to mislead the youth through over-promising and non-transparent advertising,"" according to a report.  ASCI had earlier said that it wasn't discussing changing its guidelines on crypto advertisements but clarifying its position, as an important stakeholder, on a suggested ban of Indian celebrities endorsing crypto products from India's markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).  In February, the ASCI released its guidelines for crypto or virtual digital assets-related advertisements that went into effect in April. However, ASCI’s guidelines for influencers went into effect earlier, in June of last year.  ""When we examine ads by influencers that are in violation of the ASCI code and do not carry the required disclaimer or the paid partnership tag or are breaching the ASCI code, we approach the influencer and inform them about the violation. Post this, they need to modify their ad and carry the appropriate disclaimer,"" Kapoor said in her email.  ASCI does not have the authority to ban celebrities or influencers from appearing in ads, but its guidelines are considered the blueprint to follow to protect consumers' interests.  In cases where the brands or influencers do not modify or withdraw ads that are found to be objectionable, ASCI escalates the case to government regulators.

42421509,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWCr,1656530793,Why This Crypto Crash Is Different,"The decentralized finance (DeFi)/centralized finance (CeFi) bubble is bursting, the non-fungible token (NFT) craze is burning itself out, algorithmic stablecoins are collapsing and crypto lenders are going bust. Crypto is in a bear market.  Inevitably, crypto skeptics are calling “the end of crypto.” But we’ve seen this kind of correction before. Several times, in fact. In 2014, bitcoin’s price crashed when the Mt. Gox exchange collapsed. And in 2018, bitcoin’s price fell 80% as hundreds of “initial coin offerings” (ICOs) crashed and burned. In both cases, the market eventually recovered, and crypto prices rose higher than before. Even though bitcoin has lost 70% of its dollar value since last November, it is still worth more than its December 2017 peak. So why not HODL on and wait for the market to recover?  Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.  But this time really is different. Driven by war and pandemic, a new macroeconomic paradigm is forming. High inflation is back after a 30-year absence, and with it, much tighter monetary policy. Interest rates are rising, and central banks around the world are burning money. The era of plentiful dollars is coming to an end. And that will mean persistently lower prices for cryptocurrencies.  Crypto markets have never known anything but easy money. Bitcoin was born in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when many people feared that central banks’ experiment with ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing (QE) would cause runaway inflation. Ten years later, interest rates were still far below pre-financial crisis levels, and central bank balance sheets were still massively inflated. And the runaway inflation predicted by bitcoiners had failed to appear. Instead, asset prices had risen massively – including cryptocurrency prices, as investors desperate for yield piled into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  There was a brief period of relative dollar scarcity from 2016 through 2018, when the Fed raised interest rates and burned money (“quantitative tightening”) and the U.S. Treasury issued bonds (which also burns fiat money). But as the Fed tightened, other central banks loosened. QE never really ended; it just moved around the world. And in 2019, when dollar shortages caused disruptions on repo markets, the Fed started to inject money again.  Then came the pandemic. As governments closed down businesses and handed out money to people unable to work, central banks embarked on the most exorbitant money creation programs in history. Much of that money found its way into crypto markets, raising prices to unprecedented levels and fueling the rapid growth of high-yield lending, complex synthetic assets and toxic derivatives of a kind last seen before the 2008 financial crisis. While the real economy was shut down, there was a cryptocurrency feeding frenzy. Pension funds, hedge funds, software companies, football clubs and celebrities all got in on the act, and many ordinary people made life-changing amounts of money.  The crypto industry’s luxuriant growth since Bitcoin emerged from the ashes of the financial crisis – and particularly since March 2020 – can be directly attributed to the copious monetary fertilizer central banks have been pouring into financial markets.  But now we have inflation. Economists argue about whether this inflation is principally caused by supply disruptions or excessive demand, and whether it will be transitory or long-lasting. No matter. Central banks, under pressure to get inflation under control, are rapidly removing the monetary fertilizer and getting out the pruning shears. The markets with the most luxuriant growth will suffer the sharpest cuts.  It’s perhaps easy to see why the end of easy money might spell disaster for those invested in a highly leveraged crypto bubble, but it’s less obvious why it is causing bitcoin to sell off. You’d think it would encourage people to pile into deflationary cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. After all, bitcoin was originally intended to replace the dollar, and some people still think it eventually will. What better time to buy and HODL the world’s future currency than the start of the inflationary Armageddon that will bring about the demise of the dollar as the world’s principal reserve currency?  But most of those invested in cryptocurrency now don’t want to replace the dollar. Indeed, they fear its replacement. What they want is to get rich in dollar terms. So cryptocurrency prices are typically quoted in dollars, most crypto transactions involve stablecoins pegged to dollars, and dollar-pegged stablecoins are widely used as safe collateral for crypto lending.  The crypto ecosystem has tethered itself firmly to the traditional financial system, and the dollar dominates crypto markets just as it does traditional financial markets. And as crypto markets have grown, so has the dollar value of the cryptocurrency industry.  But these dollars aren’t real. They exist only in the virtual space. They are not, and never were, guaranteed by the only institution in the world that can create real dollars, namely the Fed. The Fed has no obligation whatsoever to ensure that those who have made life-changing amounts of these “virtual dollars” can actually exchange them for real dollars. So when the crypto bubble bursts, the “virtual dollars” simply disappear. If you can’t exchange your virtual dollars for real dollars, your wealth is an illusion.  David Z. Morris - How I Made It: From Pro Baller to Master of DAOs  The only real dollars in the cryptocurrency industry are those paid by new entrants when they make their first cryptocurrency purchases. The rest of the dollar liquidity on crypto markets is provided by dollar-pegged stablecoins. These fall into two groups: those that have actual dollars and/or dollar-denominated safe liquid assets backing them, and those that don’t. There aren’t enough of the former to enable everyone to cash out into real dollars, and there’s no guarantee that the latter can be cashed out into real dollars at all. So, in effect, the entire crypto industry is fractionally reserved.  There’s now a race on to exchange cryptocurrencies for the few real dollars still available. As is always the case in unregulated markets, the law of the jungle applies. Those with the biggest teeth get the dollars. Perhaps “whales” is the wrong name for them. Crocodiles might be more like it.  When everyone is trying to cash out cryptocurrencies into increasingly scarce dollars, cryptocurrency prices rapidly fall to the level at which there are sufficient dollars in the system for everyone to be able to cash out. For derivatives and synthetics, that probably means zero. After all, if the underlying assets are falling rapidly in price, who is going to want the derivatives? And synthetics are, as their name suggests, not real. When there’s a flight to reality, unreal things are worthless.  If tighter money is here to stay, as many expect, then continuing dollar scarcity will make it impossible for crypto to rise again as it has before. Rather, it will have to adapt to the new paradigm. It could return to its roots, eschewing the dollar and valuing crypto only in terms of itself: “1 BTC = 1 BTC”, as bitcoin maximalists like to remind us. Alternatively, it could attract more real dollars by developing real-world use cases, rather than relying on network effects to pump up dollar values that are unrealizable in practice. But this is unlikely to generate the high dollar values of the past.  While the Fed is doing monetary tightening, and there is no Fed guarantee or Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) insurance for cryptocurrency deposits, there can be no return to the highly leveraged, fractionally reserved cryptocurrency system whose illusory riches are now giving way to real losses.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/06/29/why-this-crypto-crash-is-different,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c999f522ecdfc2cb9b78b3bdce8b5475cd1b1b1b-4266x2806.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421496,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoW3Z,1656526352,Digital Pseudonyms: One More Way to Make Working From Home Secure,"The recent decision by the digital payment processing company Block (SQ) to close its offices in San Francisco to allow employees to work remotely highlights a growing trend since the COVID-19 pandemic began: a Great Migration out of office work and toward working remotely. But for various reasons, that migration is facing resistance from other employers.  One major reason to insist on employees showing up at the office in consumer-facing companies – not just Big Tech but insurance, health care and all manner of others – is the databases they maintain on customers. Despite the rise of an entire industry devoted to protecting them, breaches of these databases continue unabated. According to the Identity Theft Research Center (ITRC), the number of recorded data breaches in 2021 increased by 17% over 2020.  David Chaum, a pioneer in cryptography and in privacy-preserving and secure voting technologies, is the creator and founder of the xx network. In 1995 his company, DigiCash, created and deployed eCash, the first digital currency, which used Chaum's breakthrough blind-signature protocol. This post is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week series.  Given what one commentator calls “an entrenched lack of transparency” on the part of affected companies, this estimate is probably low. IBM (IBM), meanwhile, estimates the average cost of a data breach at over $4 million. (It’s worth noting that some of the most expensive breaches last year were in the cryptocurrency/blockchain space, though these were mainly robberies rather than thefts of personal information.)  In response to these threats, some companies are building “air gap” security around the servers holding their consumer databases. They are requiring employees who work on and with them – or simply supply fresh records from customers – to interact with them only over local comms completely disconnected from the Internet. How well this will work remains to be seen.  Either way, such solutions do not address the underlying problem. In the 1980s, in the early days of computerization and the internet, I began to worry about all the information being stored on individuals by organizations – and being shared by them. Almost all these records were (and still are) headed by a universal unique identifier such as a driving license, state ID card number or social insurance number.  Read More: 'I Jumped in With All 4': Legendary Cryptographer David Chaum on the Future of Web3  These records could potentially be combined to create what I called a “virtual dossier” on every individual, in which their medical, financial, legal and employment histories as well as things like credit card numbers and billing addresses could be viewed together, simply by accessing the separate records via these identifiers.  Random numbers, opaque envelopes  To address this threat, which is now, sadly, a reality, I devised a protocol called digital blind signatures, a variation on the now well known and widely used digital signature technique. To understand how this works using a paper analogy, imagine a randomly numbered card inside an opaque envelope that is stamped from the outside with a seal like the signets once used to seal letters with wax.  The impression of the seal embosses the card inside with the signature, but once the envelope has been removed the signer has no way to determine which specific number was on the card signed. Blinding conceals a cleartext number by transforming it into cyphertext in such a way that it can be digitally “embossed” with a signature. Removing the envelope in the analogy is equivalent to the cyphertext later being decrypted [unblinded] to obtain the now signed form of the cleartext number.  This signed, unblinded number serves as a digital pseudonym that contains a credential – a digital signature of the issuing organization. A further enhancement of the technique allows the user to show the unforgeable credential to multiple organizations using different pseudonyms. In this way the individual credential holder can, for example, prove to multiple lenders that their credit rating falls within a certain range, without these proofs being linkable through an identifier and without revealing anything more.  In the same way, individuals can prove that, for example, they have paid their taxes, that they live in a certain census district, that they have received a particular vaccination or that they have tested negative for some infection within a certain period, that they hold a valid license in a particular trade or profession, that they have no criminal record and so forth. In no case are any of these credentials linkable to each other or to any other information about the individual. Organizations can store the pseudonymous credentials they receive from individuals so that the individual and the organization can maintain an ongoing relationship if desired.  Read More: Internet Privacy Is an Inalienable Right | Opinion  If some combination of credentials is required by an organization, additional proven cryptographic techniques can make a single pseudonym into a multiple credential (“multicred”) as needed, again without compromising the privacy of the pseudonym’s owner. Specifically, various individual credentials can be “stamped” on the same pseudonym by several different organizations using multiparty computation.  Protecting personal information  In general terms, multiparty computation allows a set of parties to collectively perform any agreed-upon computation, such that each party can choose secret inputs and verify that the resulting output is correct and where all secret inputs are optimally protected. In this case, none of the signers can learn the identity or the signature of any of the others, but they can each readily check that their own signature on the multicred is valid.  Switching to these digital pseudonyms, unlinkable to their owner or to each other, would render pointless the efforts of hackers and phishers to access vast troves of personal information because the information will no longer be identifiably personal. Individuals will, of course, still need social insurance numbers and driving licenses, but most organizations will not need to record them, let alone use them as identifiers for records on individuals with whom they have transacted business.  Read More: Web 3 Is More Than Fun and Games; It’s for Work | Opinion  Hence, the staffers who maintain and secure these pseudonymous data collections need no longer work inside digital air gaps or Faraday cages. They can work from home because neither the company nor bad actors using stolen records can build “data portraits” of individual customers or clients.  Switching to a system of pseudonymous digital credentials would benefit organizations by reducing the ever-growing cost of maintaining and securing records of essentially unnecessary data and the often even greater long-term cost of breaches.  And it would be a step towards what I believe must be a fundamental bedrock principle of Web3 and of true democracy going forward: Individuals should control all their personal information.

42422165,r2LAFyEJPPW5TW9PoT4tuj,1656526183,"No AML Checks For Most Transfers To Unhosted Crypto Wallets, EU Policymakers Decide","BRUSSELS, Belgium – The European Union (EU) finally agreed on landmark anti-money laundering rules for crypto transactions Wednesday, despite industry concerns over the law harming privacy and innovation.  The final proposals will mean customer identity needs to be verified for even the smallest crypto transfers, if it’s between two regulated digital wallet providers – but payments to unhosted private wallets will largely be left out of laundering checks.  EU lawmakers and government representatives have been meeting over the last three months to hash out a political deal on the bill, which was introduced in July 2021 by the European Commission.  Two sources leaving the meeting, who asked not to be named, told CoinDesk a deal had been reached on the legislation after just over an hour of talks.  Just under an hour following the publication of this article, EU lawmaker Ondřej Kovařík confirmed the provisional deal in a tweet, saying that it “strikes the right balance in mitigating risks for fighting money laundering in the crypto sector without preventing innovation and overburdening businesses.”  Outside the meeting room, Kovařík told CoinDesk that negotiators had found a “good balance” that would not prevent innovation.  ""It will allow the further development of crypto in Europe,"" Kovařík said.  In March, lawmakers said they wanted to significantly expand the scope of the bill to include transactions with unhosted digital wallets – those which aren’t managed by a regulated service provider like a licensed crypto exchange – and to have transaction details reported to the authorities regardless of risk.  That drew a cry of protest from industry players, from lobby groups to prominent crypto firms such as Coinbase (COIN), and some legal experts said it could also be considered a disproportionate and unlawful privacy breach.  Late-stage talks on the law were being held in Brussels to find a set of rules agreeable to both the European Parliament, and the Council of the EU (which groups together the 27 member states to make collective legislative decisions). The Council is currently chaired by France. The deal was made in the nick of time, just over one day before France would have had to cede control over talks to the Czech Republic.  Read more: Crypto Privacy Positions Harden Ahead of Crunch EU Vote  For the rules on transfers to unhosted wallets, Kovařík said the final result had “moved quite far from the initial proposal of the European Parliament” – something likely to be met by a sigh of relief by many in the industry.  Kovařík said those unhosted wallet rules would only apply when transfers were made to a person’s own private wallet, and only when the value was over 1,000 euros ($1,052). A further source briefed on talks has confirmed those details.  Ernest Urtasun, a member of the European Greens party, who jointly led parliament’s negotiations on the law, tweeted that the rules were “putting an end to the wild west of unregulated crypto, closing major loopholes in the European anti-money laundering rules.""  Urtasun confirmed that the final deal would mean that, for transactions between regulated wallets, customer identity details have to be recorded for even the smallest transaction. That makes crypto rules unlike those for the conventional banking sector, which only catch those worth over 1,000 euros.  Lawmakers and governments overturned European Commission plans to exempt small transactions, arguing that price volatility and the ability to break up payments into smaller chunks would make it unworkable for crypto.  Socialist lawmaker Paul Tang, who had pushed for tough anti-money laundering measures, told CoinDesk in a statement the deal meant “the verification of unhosted wallets is deeply engrained in the EU's fight against money laundering through crypto.”  “We cannot just focus on the regulated sector while keeping the backdoor open to large anonymous crypto flows,” Tang said.  The deal, which sets the essential policy lines that the final law will take, still needs to be translated into legislative text and gazetted in the EU’s Official Journal.

They combine blockchain technology with smart contracts to give people control over their data and make transactions without relying on third parties.  What exactly is Web3?  Web3 is also known as the third generation of the internet. It aims to remove control from large corporations and operate in a decentralized way that is owned, built and operated by the users themselves.  Read more: Web3 and the Metaverse Are Not the Same  Unlike traditional online companies that leverage your information, Web3 will give back control of data to the individual. It will bring unique possibilities. For instance, musical artists can post their creations on decentralized platforms or their own personal devices instead of relying on centralized organizations like Spotify or YouTube to profit from them.  Web3 aims to avoid watchdogs or agencies telling you what services you can access or can’t access. Transactions in Web3 are between two or more parties without a middleman to improve privacy, autonomy and control of data.  What are Web3 cryptos?  A cryptocurrency associated with Web3 may provide various services formerly offered by cloud providers, such as computation, bandwidth, storage, identification and hosting services.  With the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies and Web3, developers have been working on improving both technologies by making them more scalable, secure and efficient. Web3 is often mentioned with cryptocurrencies because they share the core principles of decentralization and equal access.  Read more: What is a decentralized application?

42422166,r2LAFyEJPPW5TW9PoT4tti,1656524433,US Infrastructure Law’s Reporting Requirements for Crypto Brokers Likely to Face Delay,"Hotly debated reporting requirements for crypto exchanges and brokers included in U.S. President Joe Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure law could face a major delay.  Many in the crypto industry have pushed back against the reporting provision in the infrastructure law, claiming that the law’s definition of “broker” is overly broad, and could theoretically be applied to crypto miners and decentralized protocols.  The back-and-forth over how “broker” will be defined, as well as the challenges of implementing a reporting regime, are likely to blame for the potential delay. However, no final decision has been made on whether the reporting requirements will be delayed or, if they are, how long the delay will last.  Bloomberg first reported the news.  Under the law, which was passed by Congress in November, crypto brokers would be required to collect detailed information, including customer names and addresses and capital gains or losses, on customers and their trades.  The collection requirements were initially slated to take effect in January 2023, with companies required to start sending reports to both their clients and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2024. The reporting requirements are intended to make it easier for crypto investors to do their taxes – and for the IRS to sniff out tax evasion.  The Treasury Department has been vocal about its concern over unpaid crypto taxes, which analysts have estimated as roughly 10% of all unpaid taxes – the so-called “tax gap” that has become a battle cry for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.  News of the delay will likely come as a relief to many companies that fit the “broker” definition, but this delay – if it even happens – is likely only temporary.

42394518,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAV0d,1656524403,What Are Layer 2s and Why Are They Important?,"To start, we need to define what a layer 1 is: A layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Also known as the main network or “mainnet,” it not only defines the core rules of the ecosystem, but can also validate and finalize transactions, as seen with examples like Ethereum, Bitcoin and Solana.  Layer 1 blockchains often start with an emphasis on decentralization and security – both of which are core tenets of any sound network and (with some exceptions) are maintained by a diverse, global network of developers and participants like validators.  See Also: What Is Blockchain Technology?  Due to a lack of any central authority or oversight, these platforms require the technology itself to have an innate amount of security to protect users from scams and attacks. And because of this priority in design, not to mention the immense resources it takes to maintain a fully functional ecosystem, they’ve often lacked scalability.  While some developers believe that the inability to achieve a state of equilibrium between security, decentralization and scalability is an inexorable flaw of the technology (dubbed the Blockchain Trilemma), layer 2 solutions, such as rollups on Ethereum, and the lightning network on Bitcoin are one solution used to solve these issues.  Read More: How Does Blockchain Technology Work?  What are layer 2s?  Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain solutions (separate blockchains) built on top of layer 1s that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data. Think of it like a restaurant kitchen – if every order had to be made by a single person from beginning to end before the order was confirmed and delivered, it would be a very slow process that could only fulfill a few orders an hour. But layer 2s are like prep stations – there’s a station for cleaning and cutting food, a station for cooking, a station that assembles the dishes – that is able to focus and do each task much more efficiently. When the time is right, a final person can match each assembled dish to the order and confirm it before it is sent to the final destination (the customer).  Payment platforms like Visa also use a similar system. Instead of separately managing thousands of daily micro transactions from a vendor like Starbucks that would clog the network in minutes, Visa groups them into batches to be settled in the banking system at regular intervals. The banks then store and sort transactions through their internal equivalent of a settlement layer. In this case, Visa would be a layer 2 and the broader network of institutions and government that keep a record of transactions and define the rules of the financial industry as a layer 1.  Ethereum also uses a similar method through features like Optimistic and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups that offload the burden of managing transactions from the mainnet and thereby enable greater transaction inclusion and throughput (higher transactions per second). All of which makes for a more seamless and practical user experience. Examples of layer 2s on Ethereum include solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring and zkSync.  Read More: What Is Loopring?  Why are layer 2s important?  While decentralization and security are a modus operandi of the layer 1, or mainnet, of Ethereum, the ensuing market popularity over the years has caused the network to reach its current capacity of just over 1.5 million daily transactions. Furthermore, as the mainnet can only process around 15 transactions per second, periods of high network activity often lead to data congestion. This, in turn, causes gas (transaction fees) to rise and slows the performance of applications, most recently seen by the Yuga Labs Otherside virtual land sale and during the bull market of 2021.  To combat these issues, layer 2 extends Ethereum as a separate blockchain above the layer 1 network. As mentioned, it communicates and helps offload the heavy burden of transactions from the mainnet through smart contracts that integrate and benefit from Ethereum’s robust decentralized security model. In essence, Layer 1 handles security, data availability and decentralization, while layer 2s handle scaling related to transactions.  For the most part, layer 1 blockchains have:  A network of nodes to secure and validate the network.  A network of block producers.  The main blockchain and transaction data.  An associated consensus mechanism.  Layer 2 differs by offering:  Lower fees: Layer 2s bundle multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, which helps reduce the data load. They also retain security and decentralization by settling transactions on the mainnet.  More utility: Through the combined advantages of higher transactions per second and lower fees, layer 2 projects can focus on improving user experience and expanding the scope of applications.  As mentioned, most scalability issues relate to decentralization. Unlike traditional banks that have a closed and more efficient method of regulating payments, transactions and data management with blockchains must undergo a series of systematic steps, such as acceptance, verification and distribution on a network (with thousands of participants), all while maintaining security and transparency.  As such, networks like Ethereum need to include a layered and scalable design that can compete with (and eventually supersede) the more streamlined, yet restricted, channels of systems like Visa and Mastercard. Layer 1s and layer 2s are important because they work together towards the goal of making the network faster and more user friendly.  See Also: Ethereum Nodes and Clients, a Complete Guide  How does layer 2 work?  Layer 2 protocols provide a second framework where transactions can take place separately from layer 1. This means that a decent amount of the work that would be performed by the main chain can be moved to the second layer. Layer 2 applications then post the data of transactions to layer 1 where it’s secured in the blockchain ledger and history.  As with any other open or closed platforms, layer 2s also vary in accessibility. Some can be used by a range of applications, while others only cater to the whims of a specific project. That said, several of the key components that layer 2s leverage include rollups and sidechains.  Layer 2 rollups  A rollup is a specific layer 2 solution that executes hundreds of transactions outside of layer 1, rolls them up into a single piece of compressed data and then posts the data back to the mainnet for anyone to review and dispute if deemed suspicious. By doing so, rollups not only utilize the security of Ethereum but can also reduce gas fees by up to 10-100x.  Although rollups all help with deposits, withdrawals and verify proofs, there are subtle variations in the way rollups, such as Optimism and ZK rollups, post data back to layer 1.  Optimistic rollups  Optimistic rollups sit in parallel to the main Ethereum chain, run all the transactions and then post the data back to layer 1. Users are incentivized to transact on these layer 2s due to the competitively low fees. If a fraudulent transaction is suspected, it can be challenged and assessed through fraud proofs. In this scenario, the rollup will run the transaction’s computation using the available state data. Compared to ZK rollups (explained below) this means that the time to exit the rollup and withdraw funds back to layer 1 will be slightly longer. However, ""inside"" the rollup users will still receive fast transaction confirmation.  In general, Optimistic rollups are Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and solidity compatible, which means that anything possible on layer 1 of Ethereum can be replicated on layer 2.  Several examples of Optimistic rollups include Arbitrum, Optimism and Boba.  ZK rollups  In contrast to Optimistic rollups, ZK rollups generate cryptographic proofs to validate the authenticity of transactions. These proofs (posted to layer 1) are called validity proofs or SNARK (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge), or STARKs (scalable transparent argument of knowledge).  ZK rollups are more efficient because they maintain the state of all transfers on layer 2, which are updated solely through validity proofs. As ZK rollups don't need the entire transaction data, it's easier to validate blocks and transfer ether (ETH), the main token of the Ethereum blockchain, to layer 1. The validity proof (accepted by the ZK rollup contract) has already verified the authenticity of transactions. That said, they do not have full EVM support and are more intensive to run computations for applications with little on-chain activity.  Several examples of ZK rollups include dYdX, Loopring and zkSync.  Sidechains  As seen through projects like XDai and Polygon PoS, a sidechain is an independent, EVM-compatible blockchain that runs parallel and interacts with the mainnet through bridges. As they use a separate consensus mechanism and are not secured by layer 1, they are not technically considered layer 2. However, the chain works the same as Ethereum because it models the EVM. That said, there’s greater levels of risks surrounding sidechain operators because users trust them with funds, rather than the Ethereum protocol (or a proper layer 2).  Read More: What Are Blockchain Bridges and How Do They Work?  Validiums  Validiums, such as StarkWare, use validity proofs (similar to ZK rollups) but don't store the data on layer 1. Multiple validity chains can run in parallel with one another and are each able to process approximately 10,000 transactions per second. However, as more specialized languages are required, there is limited support for general smart contracts.  Both sidechains and validiums are blockchains that run in parallel with Ethereum and interact with assets through bridges that connect to the mainnet. They do not gain security or data from Ethereum itself and therefore aren’t considered to be a proper layer 2 like Optimistic or ZK rollups. This is especially the case given the potential security and trust implications. However, both scale similarly to layer 2s by offering lower transaction fees and high throughput.  Why are there so many layer 2s?  Various layer 2 channels have been created to prevent any overdependence or the potential collapse of a single part of the network. However, as we’ve covered the main layer 2s (Optimistic rollups, ZK rollups and sidechains), the ecosystem is constantly shifting, and some applications end up abandoned, such as Plasma and State Channels.  Examples of common layer 2s  Overall, as layer 2s harmonize and work with the entire Ethereum ecosystem, the various options, which anyone can build, offer a greater, more balanced range of options for end users. What one layer 2 blockchain lacks can be balanced with advantages of another and vice versa. The following is a summary of the more commonly used layer 2s:  General layer 2s  A general layer 2 project mirrors the performance and functionality of Ethereum's mainnet, with cheaper fees (gas). Some examples include:  Optimism  Although a new fraud-proof system is still being built, Optimism is an EVM-equivalent system that uses Optimistic rollups to make transactions fast, simple, and secure.  Risk & analysis: https://l2beat.com/projects/optimism/  Arbitrum One  Arbitrum is another Optimistic rollup that mirrors the dynamics of Ethereum mainnet but with cheaper transaction fees.  Risk & analysis: https://l2beat.com/projects/arbitrum/  Boba Network  Forked initially from Optimism, Boba is an Optimistic rollup that aims to reduce fees, improve transaction throughput and strengthen the capacity of smart contracts.  Risk & analysis: https://l2beat.com/projects/bobanetwork/  Application-specific layer 2s  In comparison, application-specific layer 2 networks are more specialized and focus on improving the performance of a niche market sector. Examples include:  Loopring  Loopring is a ZK rollup that aims to provide the same security as Ethereum's mainnet with more scalability, such as throughput increased by 1000x and transaction costs reduced to 0.1% of layer 1.  zKSync  Used by platforms like Binance, zkSync is a ZK rollup from Matter Labs. It's already live on the Ethereum mainnet and supports payments, token swaps and non-fungible token (NFT) minting.  Abandoned layer 2s  Not every experiment or idea for a layer 2 works. Here are some examples of projects that aimed to solve a problem but failed to catch on.  Plasma  As stated in a blog post published in January 2020, the Ethereum research organization Plasma Group announced it ceased operations in its current form and has donated the remaining funds to Gitcoin. The decision was made to focus on Optimistic rollups instead.  As seen through projects like Polygon, OMG Network and Gluon, plasma chains are separate blockchains tied to the Ethereum mainnet. They use fraud-proofs like Optimistic rollups to regulate disputes and manage security. As they are smaller copies of the Ethereum mainnet, they are also known as ""child chains."" Merkel trees enable an endless stack of these chains that can work to help offload heavy data bandwidth from parent chains, including the mainnet. However, plasma isn't useful for arbitrary contracts, only for transfers. And hence, along with issues like expensive costs and difficulties withdrawing funds from a plasma chain, it was abandoned in favor of Optimistic rollups.  State channels  State channels are pathways opened between two users that wish to communicate with each other via transactions. By utilizing multi-signature contracts (a type of contract that requires signatures of multiple parties to execute), they allow participants to transact freely off-chain and settle with the mainnet. This enables high transaction throughput and minimizes congestion and fees. Two main types of channels are state channels and payment channels. However, due to the rigidity in needing users to lock up funds, coupled with the lack of support for general-purpose smart contracts and DeFi applications in 2021, it was also mostly abandoned. According to Ethhub, teams that are still working on it include CelerX Connext Network. Raiden Network may also be near or in production.  Further layer 2 resources and considerations  Due to the nascency of these layer 2 platforms, there are still risks and varying degrees of faulty trust assumptions compared to transacting on the mainnet. It's also worth noting that despite leveraging the security of layer 1, layer 2s are only truly safe if they have fraud proofs enabled, which (at the time of this writing) they do not.  Blockchain bridges (that people can use to transfer assets to layer 2) are also in the early stages of development and carry high degrees of risk. With all this in mind, thorough due diligence through resources like L2BEAT is recommended before engaging with any layer 2. L2BEAT is a comprehensive risk and analysis platform committed to educating users about projects that match their high standards and rigorous definitions of what it means to be a layer 2.

The weak global economy notwithstanding, he plans to start his career working in the next iteration of the internet, blockchain-based Web3.  The 23-year-old has interned at Baidu, China’s internet search behemoth, and at global venture firm GGV Capital. He is disappointed by the dwindling opportunities in Web2 amid China’s tech crackdown and fascinated by the growing potential in Web3. An adventurer in spirit, he doesn’t want to settle down at a traditional tech company, like most of his computer science peers do.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week series.  “Finding a stable job, getting married, buying a house … these are just not my thing,” he said. “I look for flexibility, freedom and a faster career path … and this space is just like that, and with little office politics or nepotism. It is about your individual abilities – you get rewarded for what you can do.”  A new frontier in the tech industry, Web3 draws students and fresh graduates from all over the world who have technical know-how and whose skills are readily applicable to blockchain development. These young crypto believers are often fully committed to working in the sector, attracted by the idea of decentralization and their faster career advancement potential. They are unfazed by the battered job market and volatile cryptocurrency prices.  Investors’ reluctance to embrace Web3  Yes, investors are thinking twice about putting money in this heated industry, with steep drops of bitcoin and ETH as well as the collapse of the terra stablecoin and its corresponding luna token, default of the Three Arrows Capital crypto hedge fund and freezing of withdrawals from Celsius Network’s lending platform.  Meanwhile, the macroeconomic climate is getting worse, with inflation at a 40-year high, soaring energy prices and global supply chain logjams. Still, the bad economic news doesn’t appear to be dampening young job seekers’ determination to jump into Web3.  Read More: What Is Web 3 and Why Is Everyone Talking About It?  In the Bay Area, Ratan Kaliani, 20, a rising senior at the University of California, Berkeley, is already working full time in a DEX (decentralized exchange) infrastructure startup. He got into crypto with peers from Blockchain at Berkeley, a student-run organization and blockchain consultancy.  The recent crypto climate doesn’t daunt this ex-Coinbase intern’s passion for crypto.  “When you are committed to something, you want to be able to explore it the fullest,” he said. When asked how he will finish his senior year while working full time, he chuckled. “I am probably going to be pretty busy.”  Saif Uddin Mahmud, 24, is a Bangladeshi with a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering from the National University of Singapore. Having worked as the technical lead in a Singapore-based health-care startup, he recently took a leap of faith and is in the planning stages of a Web3 startup he is co-founding with friends.  A radical response  Kaliani and Saif share a faith in crypto, specifically admiring that it is a blockchain-powered system with decentralized authority. The emerging technology seems to speak to young adults looking for a mission – a radical response to the current Web2 system that has been criticized for exploiting the free labor of users that is then monetized to enrich the corporation.  The recent crypto crash is seen as part of a normal cycle of bull and bear markets. In fact, some, such as Saif, believe that the crash will filter out opportunist traders who want to make quick money: “The noise will quiet down a bit, which means that there will be more people who are genuinely interested in the technology,” he said.  Even amid the uncertainty, young crypto enthusiasts of all disciplines are seeking jobs, not just software engineers. Finance, business and even law students are also taking an interest in crypto.  Read More: Visa Looking to Hire College Students to Develop In-House Crypto Talent  Lai Yuen is a 25-year-old Singaporean who just finished his undergraduate study in finance at the National University of Singapore. He initially aspired to be a portfolio manager, but grew disillusioned by the rigid metrics of success in finance and wanted to carve out a path of his own.  That path means starting an NFT (non-fungible token) company while working as an investment analyst for the digital-asset management arm of a foundation that supports open-source crypto projects. He took an 18-hour flight from Singapore to New York this month to attend the NFT.NYC conference, seeking to build connections in the industry.  A Chinese student who will graduate with a master’s in accounting from National University of Singapore this August, Sabrina Li is interning at crypto exchange Bybit. She still sees crypto as an attractive career opportunity. Hoping to convert to a full-time employee at Bybit, the 24-year-old is doing all she can to learn about crypto.  “If I can enter the market and take root, then I will be growing much faster in my career than in a financial firm, where things are very much institutionalized,” she said.  Some caution  Of course, not all twentysomethings are ready to jump into an uncertain market in an emerging technology.  Benjamin Peck is another Singaporean who is about to start the penultimate year of his double-degree program in law and liberal arts at Yale-NUS College in Singapore. His first foray into crypto-related work is his current internship at a Singapore-based startup that is creating a payment infrastructure for crypto trading. While inspired by what cryptocurrencies promise, the future lawyer is cautious about seeking a career there.  “Not a lot of crypto companies have proven themselves to be profitable, resilient and able to generate impact,” he said. Peck added that his career interest in the crypto industry would hinge on where there are sustainable businesses.  In the Bay Area, a student pursuing a master’s program in software management at Carnegie Mellon University Silicon Valley expresses his concern about embarking on a crypto career. The student, who wishes to be anonymous, had been involved in crypto since the age of 14. In Eastern Europe, where he lived, he would import crypto mining machines from China and with his father mine bitcoins and ETH. This interest continued into his freshman year in college, when he would miss lectures to try to buy more mining rigs. In his current school, he has been doing a few research projects working with NFTs.  Despite his early exposure and consistent interest, he doesn’t want to get a job in crypto, citing job security as the main concern. In around half a year, he will finish his master’s degree, after which he hopes to continue working in the U.S. The last thing he wants is to have his job offer rescinded just before he graduates.  Read More: Crypto Jobs: Who’s Cutting and Hiring?  “There is a future in crypto but you have to leverage it correctly,” he said.  Singaporean Tan Jian Zhen is even less enthusiastic. The 21-year-old is highly skeptical of the crypto industry. A holder of a diploma in information technology from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, a post-secondary institution in Singapore, the startup enthusiast has been trying to start a crypto company of his own for the past five years.  “I think some specific use cases are interesting, but this is not a sustainable field,” Tan said. A major part of his skepticism comes from crypto's unregulated nature. “Society needs regulation. If not, chaos ensues.  “I will remain in the tech startup space, but it doesn’t have to be crypto,” he added, “Cryptocurrencies feel like they can change the world, but they are not.”  But many others would disagree. The decentralized and anti-censorship nature of crypto and blockchain-based organizations is enough to make it a potent force, said Lin, the Chinese computer scientist, as it is “difficult to be with big government and corporations.”  In fact, it is powerful enough to keep the Chinese government on its toes. Lin expects more regulatory oversight in his home country. A native of Hangzhou, the birthplace of Alibaba and some of the biggest Web2 firms, he looks abroad for a place more supportive of this novel technology. He leaves that choice open, but remains dedicated to Web3 and building what he is passionate about.

The price of bitcoin at the time of this writing is ranging towards $20,000 with drawdown.

42422151,r2LAFyEJPPW5TW9PoT4thW,1656517768,Crypto Derivatives Exchange Bybit to Settle Options Contracts in USDC,"Crypto derivatives exchange Bybit said it is offering options contract settlement using USD coin (USDC).  The exchange said in a press release that USDC, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the United States dollar and the second largest by market capitalization, will enable stable prices for the duration of each contract.  Most crypto options are margined and settled using the same currency. For example, if bitcoin (BTC) is used as collateral in a contract, it will also be used as the settlement currency. Bybit says its move to settle using USDC is a first for crypto options trading.  The settlement date is the date when a trade is final, and the buyer must make payment to the seller while the seller delivers the assets to the buyer. Options contracts and other derivatives have settlement dates for trades in addition to a contract's expiration dates.  Bybit’s choice to use USDC for contracts because of its stability unfolds against a bear-market backdrop of stablecoin doubts. In May, Terra's UST, then the third-largest stablecoin by market cap, crashed to near zero from its dollar peg. Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin, lost $10 billion in market capitalization the same month when investors started to redeem the tokens.  Amid the general crypto market volatility, USDC is being seen as a more reliable and transparent option, according to analysts.  Bybit collateral  Bybit currently supports USDT, BTC, ether (ETH) and USDC as collateral, with more assets to be added, it said. Under the newly launched unified margin account, users of Bybit’s European-style, USDC-settled options will also be able to use all assets under their account as collateral to trade USDC options contracts and perpetuals.  “Our derivatives platform has the world’s best liquidity and tightest spread, so traders are ensured the best quote and best execution in the market even during extreme volatility,” said Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit, in the press release.

42422156,r2LAFyEJPPW5TW9PoT4tla,1656517560,Polkadot Chief Gavin Wood Announces Blockchain Governance Upgrade,"Polkadot has upgraded its decision-making process to be more inclusive and decentralized, while dramatically increasing the number of proposals that can be voted on, the blockchain ecosystem’s founder, Gavin Wood, announced at the annual community gathering, Polkadot Decoded.  Polkadot’s Governance version 2 (Gov2) will remove any preferential “first-class citizens” in terms of governance, such as the Polkadot Council and Technical Committee, leaving a single class of referendum participants, an accompanying blog post states. The new version also includes various tweaks to streamline governance processes so that many decisions can be made simultaneously.  Gov2 is set to launch on Kusama, Polkadot’s more nimble and experimental sister network, imminently, according to the blog post, following a final professional audit of its code. Once Gov2 is tested on Kusama, a proposal will be made for the Polkadot network to vote on, Wood added, without stating how long that process will take.  Decentralized governance of large and complex systems isn’t easy – a fact that’s been demonstrated repeatedly, from Ethereum’s early, bruising experience of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) through to the current state of fractious deliberation engulfing the MakerDAO community.  Polkadot, which is composed of a rule-enforcing relay chain and a series of separate but connected proof-of-stake blockchain environments running in parallel called parachains, now relies on an elected Council executive, whose limited bandwidth meant the system favored the deep consideration of very few proposals rather than a broad consideration of many.  “In Gov2, anyone is able to start a referendum at any time, and they can do this as many times as they wish,” the blog post states. “Anyone can also vote on these referenda. There are no explicit limits on the number of referenda which are open to vote on at any time.”  New ""Origins""  While Gov2 attempts to remove centralized voting hierarchy, in order to make the potential scope of things to vote on manageable, the new system introduces a grading of importance for decision making: Independent proposals are described by “Origins,” denoting the importance of a proposal; then they are assigned a “track” through which each proposal progresses.  For instance, “the Root Origin has the highest thresholds and safeguards and only allows a single über-dangerous proposal to be decided at a time,” while less powerful Origins have accordingly shorter consideration periods and lower thresholds for approval.  The person responsible for the proposal is allowed to specify which Origin he would like his proposal to be executed with. This allocation, in turn, will determine which track that proposal will follow and how the referendum will be conducted.  “Having independent tracks allows us to tailor the dynamics of referenda based upon their implied privilege level. Referenda which execute their proposals from more powerful Origins will have more stringent safeguards, higher thresholds and longer consideration periods,” the blog post states.  Proposals need to also meet three criteria levels before they can be elevated to a “deciding state,” including a lead-in period with a set time frame, a decision allocation (there must be room in an appropriate track for the proposal to be included) and finally, payment of a “decision deposit,” which covers the cost of on-chain storage of the referendum and prevents spam.  The Polkadot Fellowship  Polkadot’s Technical Committee, which existed in the first version of the governance system, will be replaced by a more decentralized body called the “Polkadot Fellowship” in order to prevent a position of expert command or ruling cabal from forming. It will also prevent members from having so much decision-making power that they could be unduly pressured (by authorities, “malevolent or benign,” for example) to act in certain ways.  Unlike the current Technical Committee, the Fellowship is designed to be far broader in membership and could include tens of thousands of members, with far lower barriers to entry both in terms of administrative process flow and expectations of expertise.  “The Fellowship is a mostly self-governing expert body with a primary goal of representing the humans who embody and contain the technical knowledge base of the Polkadot network and protocol,” the blog post states. “Becoming a candidate member in the Fellowship is as easy as placing a small deposit.”  These members are then given a rank “to designate the degree to which the system expects their opinion to be well-informed, of a sound technical basis and in line with the interests of Polkadot.”  In order to make this process of ranking Fellowship members transparent and accountable, there will be a constitution that lays out the requirements and expectations associated with any given rank.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | MKR | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/29/polkadot-chief-gavin-wood-announces-blockchain-governance-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e30e30f4c9a9e311b791a39e2b9373c09ee0e06-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394046,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bucjer,1656515562,What It’s Like to Work as a DAO Bounty Hunter,"No bosses. No 9-5 grind. No corporate bureaucracy. Limitless potential for growth. This is the lure of DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations, which many in the Web3 space view as the “future of work.”  At a DAO, instead of toiling away as a cog in the corporate wheel, you can unleash your inner entrepreneur and contribute as much or little as you’d like. You can work at one DAO or you can work at 10 DAOs. Maybe you choose to work 12-hour days for a month, save up some cash and then spend your summer kayaking the Sea of Cortez. You’re in full control.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.  Kind of.  It’s true that all of this sounds alluring, but it’s also true that it’s hopelessly opaque. How do you actually make money at a DAO? How do you cobble together work? What types of gigs are out there?  To bridge us from the abstract to the concrete, I spoke with a full-time DAO worker who goes by T Wells, a 30-something former educator who, in 2021, began hunting for “bounties” in the DAO ecosystem. Bounties are basically gig postings. If a DAO needs to create a logo, they might post a bounty and quickly find a talented designer.  T Wells became good at bounties. He enjoyed it. In his “real world” job in education tech and curriculum development, his skills ranged from writing to graphic design to producing videos. “To be an effective educator, you have to be a Swiss Army knife,” says T Wells. “It’s just the way it is. Educators are often underestimated.”  So he put those skills to work at the DAOs, first knocking out bounties for 1Hive, and later contributing to DAOs like ShapeShift and Gnosis. These bounties started to add up. He built relationships with the DAOs and they gave him more work. He pitched his own projects. The DAO-work went so well that he quit his job in education. Even now, after crypto prices tumbled, T Wells is bullish on his DAO work. “There's just a lot of opportunity,” says T Wells, “And a lot of really enthusiastic people that are sincere about building a better future.”  This is how he did it.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  How’d you first start making money at a DAO?  T Wells: I took my first bounty in early 2021. One of the nice things about this space is the ease of access. If you find a task that needs doing and you have the skill set that matches up with it and you have a set of basic pre-existing relationships with people in that DAO, it's very easy to get started.  Walk us through the mechanics. How does it work?  Coming into the DAO of 1Hive, they have great community moderators and people who are going to welcome you and ask you questions. Maybe they help figure out where you might fit best.  So in my case, because I was working in education, I paired up with a couple of the communications folks. And there was some low-hanging fruit, like writing articles and doing banner design. It was an easy way to get involved and be a part of what's happening. Plus I can get compensated in some crypto and develop a sense of ownership and belonging in the community.  Is that when you found the bounty list? What does it look like?  You’ll typically see a list of projects that has three columns: Not Started, In Progress and Finished. That’s the generic example.  With 1Hive, they pointed me to the bounty list and said, ""Okay, so these are the ones we need to do. They're not started yet. Is there anything you think you could tackle?"" And then they asked for a few samples of work. And then it was sort of off to the races.  What was on that bounty list? Just a few examples?  They needed Medium articles to be written, banners, Twitter copy, videos to be made. One of the very first bounties I did was a very short tutorial video explaining the “Connext Bridge.” So it could be as simple as a tutorial video. [The Connext Bridge is a way of “transferring assets from Matic to xDai (now Gnosis) powered by Connext.” If that still sounds like gobblylook, you can watch T Well’s tutorial.]  What does bounty work pay? And how does it stack up to comparable work in the Web2 world?  When I first began, I was working full time elsewhere. So it was less about, ""Oh, it's a competitive rate,"" and more about the interesting opportunity. And for most people I know who are working full time in the DAO space now, they had also had that phase where it was first a side hustle. But that means the rates are competitive, right? Or, ultimately, you wouldn’t be able to make that transition to full time if they weren’t.  Makes sense. What’s a concrete example?  So I think there was a short video under two minutes, and I think that paid around $350 or $400. And I was somewhat of an unknown quantity at the time, right?  Scaling it up, to give you another example, from a larger DAO, a sort of longer-form video would be closer to $1,500.  That's real money.  For sure. And I mean, some DAOs are serious about trying to attract talent, and they know that it needs to be incentivized.  So you were doing a mix of videos, blog posts, banner designs. What would a banner design pay?  Yeah, it would be less than $100, right? It’s been a while since I’ve done those.  Got it. What was the next step for you? Did you just keep banging out more bounties?  On the video side, for example, I think once I had some success doing that, it became less about, ""When's the next video bounty?"" and more about, if we need a video done, they would tend to default to people who had done the bounty successfully. There were more opportunities for me, and a direct line of work with the 1Hive DAO. I think that's likely the case for all kinds of work, right?  Right. You start with bounties almost as a cold freelancer, and then you build relationships.  Exactly. The bounty is typically the place where a lot of people get their foot in the door and then develop deeper relationships and contributions with the organization.  So how did you contribute in a deeper way?  If you're the kind of person who’s looking for new ways to contribute, and you've built a track record, then typically the door is open at certain DAOs for you to propose more things that you can do.  You pitched them a new scope of work? What happened in your case?  Yeah. This was [the fourth quarter] of last year. I was fortunate enough to have a good group of folks at 1Hive that I was working with, and they wanted to make a push for more content on YouTube, some live content.  So, we spun up essentially a sub-DAO. And I've been helping to run a sub-DAO on the communications side for 1Hive. This led to new opportunities to do more PM [project management].  How did that pitching process work? Is it like the Web3 version of Don Draper [of ""Mad Men""] putting together a pitch deck? How’d you sell it?  [Laughs.] Well, the more you consider this stuff, the human element is never removed. The starting point has to be the relationships in the organization. You see it at 1Hive and elsewhere.  A proposal will show up on the Forum [the platform where proposals are voted on], and it was never really discussed in the Discord. Well, what happens to the post? Most likely, it doesn’t get a whole lot of attention.  You mean that if some ""rando"" just pitches something out of the blue and asks for a vote – without socializing the concept – it’s less likely to be green-lit?  The key point here is that the relationships within the DAO are the right starting point, and the best way to establish those relationships, I think, is doing great bounty work. That’s the place to start.  When was your inflection point? When did DAO work go from being a side hustle to your main source of income?  The moment I had the approval of the 1Hive community to move forward with the communications project as more of a PM was the point where I was, like, “Ok, now we have runway, and now we have the resources to make this possible.”  Backing up a bit: Overall, how would you say that DAO work compares to your old life where you had a full-time job?  The trade-offs really are the differences between freelancing and being employed. You have greater freedom but less predictability.  I certainly wouldn't say it's for everyone, but I think that for people who are already inclined to freelance work and have an entrepreneurial spirit and are willing to engage with people and are interested in learning new things there's a lot of interesting opportunities, even on the non-technical side.  How about some other non-tech examples? You mentioned blog posts, banner ads and video. Any others?  Any type of communications work. People are looking for social media managers. They're looking for folks who are keen on business development. Even the sort of internal communications side – ensuring there is smooth communication and clarity between the technical people and the non-technical people. I mean, DAOs need that connective tissue just like any other organization.  How does your overall compensation compare to your pre-DAO life?  Month to month it's different because you're not salaried. So that's probably more akin to freelancing. But at the end of the day, I think the average is more or less the same.  How do you get paid? In tokens native to the DAO? Bitcoin? Fiat?  Well, the vast majority, if not all, of the bounty work that I did initially through 1Hive was all paid out in the token of the DAO. There are other cases where a DAO is able to pay in stablecoins. Those are typically bigger DAOs that have active treasury management and the like.  Obviously the crypto markets have been bloody. How has that impacted DAO work?  I'd be lying if I said nothing had changed. I think everybody is taking a close look at their resources and how they're going to allocate them. And so it’s certainly a bit more challenging now. But I think people who spent time to build good relationships – and really work to provide genuine value – will make it. The serious people who are in this for the long haul are here now, and they're not going anywhere.  How would you say this is different from your normal life?  I feel like I have more control over what I'm putting my time into. And that’s empowering. And the people I work with are a huge part of that; we're all trying to build things together, rather than deferring to people above us in a hierarchy. So that's a super-empowering feeling.

42394514,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAUg7,1656514536,Luna (LUNA) vs. Luna Classic (LUNC): What Is the Difference?,"Terra, a once-$40 billion digital asset ecosystem, crumbled in May 2022 in what may have marked the largest token collapse in crypto history.  UST, once the largest algorithmic stablecoin, and its twin token LUNA, which was supposed to stabilize UST’s price, spiraled almost to zero within a week. Prior to the collapse, both UST and LUNA were top 10 cryptocurrencies. The Terra blockchain needed to be halted twice during the crisis.  Read more: The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA  Countless investors lost their life savings in the demise. Developers who worked on Terra-related projects found their livelihoods in jeopardy, and other blockchains, such as Polygon and Kadena, were courting those devs with multimillion-dollar funds.  One part of the community decided to stay and focus on how to revive the project, with Do Kwon, the founder of Terra blockchain developer firm Terraform Labs, spearheading the attempt.  As a result, now there are two Terra blockchains operating in parallel:  The old (original) Terra network with the token renamed to luna classic (LUNC) and UST tokens.  A newly launched blockchain with a native token called luna (LUNA).  If you feel confused, you are not alone. Here’s a guide to what has changed with revival.  Why there are two versions of the luna token  In the wake of Terra’s implosion, Do Kwon came up with a proposal called Terra Ecosystem Revival Plan 2 on Terra’s developer forum.  He proposed a plan to create a new blockchain with a fork and then distribute new tokens among the community members based on how many UST and LUNA tokens they held. The majority of validators – the guardians of the network who approve transactions in the network and possess governance rights – voted to approve the proposal.  The new Terra blockchain (Terra 2) launched on May 28, 2022. In parallel, the old blockchain – often referred to as “Terra Classic” – remained live but with little to no activity and no plans for development on it.  After the launch, the new native token of the new network inherited the LUNA name.  The old blockchain continued to operate, and its token was rebranded to luna classic (LUNC).  What is luna classic (LUNC)?  Luna classic (LUNC) was originally created to be the first Terra blockchain’s native token under the name LUNA, launched in 2018.  Its role was to serve as a twin token to absorb any price deviation of the blockchain’s algorithmic stablecoin, terraUSD (UST). UST was supposed to keep its price pegged to the U.S. dollar by creating (minting) and (destroying) burning UST tokens to balance the stablecoin’s supply and demand at a $1 price peg. When UST lost its dollar peg and collapsed in May 2022, the token fell into a hyperinflationary spiral because the algorithm that was intended to back up UST created trillions of tokens, diminishing its value by almost 100%.  As a result, the token that was worth $119 in early April of 2022 fell below one cent by the end of May 2022.  Read more: Algorithmic Stablecoins: What They Are and How They Can Go Terribly Wrong  What is luna (LUNA)?  May 28 marked the official launch of the new Terra blockchain. On the same day, some previous UST and LUNC holders received their new LUNA tokens in the first round of token distribution called an airdrop.  Many of the big-name cryptocurrency exchanges supported the launch and listed the new token. Trading started with wild price swings in each direction as traders speculated on the future utility of the coin.  There are some key differences between the new luna token and the old one:  There will be a finite supply of luna tokens, maximized at 1 billion coins in circulation.  Luna does not have a stablecoin pair at the time of the launch.  Are luna and luna classic risky?  Investing in either luna classic (LUNC) or luna (LUNA) is highly risky at this point. It's like purchasing a house burned down to ashes or putting money upfront for plans that only exist on paper, respectively.  The future of the old Terra blockchain – including its LUNC and UST tokens – is uncertain, with little incentive to use and build any project on top of it.  The challenge for the new blockchain is how many of the numerous protocols and development teams that were building on old Terra will trust and stick around to develop applications.  The activity and use cases on the new blockchain will ultimately determine how much luna is worth and if it will succeed.

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Market Moves: Bitcoin is down 5% after a report the liquidation of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was ordered by a British Virgin Islands court.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) has dipped below $20,000 on a report the liquidation of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) ordered by a British Virgin Islands court.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at around $19,700, down 5% on the day.  Ether (ETH) took a larger dip, trading 8% lower over the last 24 hours. Solana’s SOL was down 11% and Avalanche’s AVAX dipped by 8%.  With uncertainty in the market rife right now, Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Economics, said that “the slightest negative revelation is heavily amplified in such a dire economic backdrop where people consider crypto assets as risk-on trades.”  “Coupled with exchanges under pressure and [decentralized finance] platforms being stress tested to a degree only imagined by those who built them in the 'good' times, that uncertainty is not unfounded,” added Deane.  Deane said that with no clear path forward as yet, his view is this nervousness in the market will continue for “some time.” There is probably more shakeout to come, possibly from the mining sector, which he called an area worth watching closely.  In traditional markets, European stocks retreated as global sentiment remained volatile. The pan-European Stoxx 600 dropped by 1.2%.  Market moves  By Jamie Crawley  The liquidation of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) has been ordered by a British Virgin Islands (BVI) court, a person with knowledge of the situation told CoinDesk.  The court order was made on June 27.  Partners from New York-based Teneo Restructuring have been called in to handle the insolvency, the person said.  Three Arrows Capital, founded by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies in 2012, has suffered heavy losses in the recent sharp downturn in the crypto markets. The possibility of insolvency was reported in mid-June after it incurred at least $400 million in liquidations.  Crypto brokerage Voyager Digital (VOYG.TO) issued a default notice to 3AC this week after the fund failed to make required payments on loans of 15,250 bitcoins and $350 million in USDC. Voyager's shares had plunged after it disclosed its exposure to 3AC.  3AC has been an active investor in the digital asset industry in recent years with investments across non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralized finance (DeFi), layer 1 blockchain firms and crypto companies.  Teneo declined to comment. 3AC did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  The court order and Teneo's role was reported earlier by Sky News.

42422155,r2LAFyEJPPW5TW9PoT4tkZ,1656511200,Polygon Deploys Custom Blockchain Scaling System 'Avail',"Polygon has deployed Avail, a scaling system designed for developers to launch their blockchain applications atop the main Polygon chain and other blockchains.  Avail lead developer Anurag Arjun told CoinDesk the new product would allow developers to access blockchain data “off-chain,” meaning they would not need to continually check data from the network for an application deployed on Polygon.  Applications built on Avail would give developers the ability to update, fork and change how their blockchains handle execution.  “This is critical for [decentralized finance] and game developers that may need to patch bugs, experiment with execution or just reduce their dependencies on external chains,” Arjun told CoinDesk.  The product is intended to address “data availability” problems faced by scaling applications, he said. This is a complex problem faced by blockchain developers: How are nodes sure about when a new block is produced, all of the data in that block was actually published to the network? There’s no way to detect malicious transactions hidden within that block in case a block producer doesn’t release all of the data of that block.  Avail uses advanced mathematical techniques to assess blockchain data provided by node operators to determine the authenticity of data, without needing to rely on all node operators to verify the data.  “Availability can be determined by only downloading a very small random sample of the total data, effectively solving the data availability problem,” Arjun told CoinDesk.  Currently, so-called ""monolithic"" blockchains, such as Ethereum, can not scale as there are too many tasks to perform (execution, settlement, and data availability). Scaling products, such as Avail, focus on just one part of the application requests at a time to speed up transactions.  Avail can be deployed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain. EVM refers to the software platform that developers can use to create decentralized applications (dapps) on Ethereum.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/29/polygon-deploys-custom-blockchain-scaling-solution-avail,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03ee6b17c947154063f06de99badb8294a85a1b0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421544,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYTF,1656510316,DAOs Are the Real Meritocracies,"The first limited liability company was established in Wyoming in 1977, and It took a decade for the federal government – and many business owners – to wrap their heads around this pivot in the idea of organization and ownership in business. Coincidentally, it seems Wyoming yet again serves as the legal birthplace of this new type of enterprise, as it is the first state to officially recognize a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) as a business entity.  DAOs represent the most dramatic shift of structure, governance and asset management in business in our contemporary lives. Though many DAOs that govern treasuries have fallen prey to losses due to exploits or bugs in the code, these issues are a reflection of the greater need across all of Web3 for robust auditing – and not a reflection of the value of decentralized governance itself. In concept, DAOs now stand out as the most significant leap in terms of how we can think about running and managing organizations since the disco era.  Parker McCurley is the founder of Decent, a decentralized autonomous organization. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Future of Work Week series  By and large, however, the primary questions concerning DAOs in the larger conversation remain fundamental in nature. Chiefly, what exactly are the principles that define organizations and businesses, and can DAOs meet and redefine those standards in a healthier, more equitable way?  Open-source access to knowledge  In most business structures, information is kept secret, as though knowledge itself assigns a monetary right to ownership. In extreme cases, we have even witnessed manufacturers purposefully designing products so that owners are unable to repair or modify them out of fear that may lead to the increase of reverse-engineered designs. Thankfully, right-to-repair laws are starting to come to the U.S., but when even physical items have become inaccessible to inquiring minds, we’ve crossed a line when it comes to stifling competition and knowledge of how the world works. Locking innovative technologies in proprietary forms suppresses valuable information that could be used to improve systems and conditions for all.  This exclusionary behavior inhibits innovation by design, prioritizing proprietors’ need to generate value and prohibiting competitors from piercing their monopoly. Imagine if the entire human genome had to be rediscovered to perform genetic research. Think of all the ways that keeping information in silos can damage advancements in nearly every field of science, health care, business and entertainment. Unfettered access to information leads to innovation, and innovation enables emerging technologies to evolve in ways that serve to advance knowledge in naturalistic and representational ways. Empowering individuals is the catalyst for true societal progress.  Read more: The Coming InDAOstrial Revolution  Open-source methodologies break down the walled gardens built by privileged corporations and restore to all the freedom to innovate, paving the way for society to progress. However, a major roadblock to open-source approaches becoming more common is the lack of uniform standards of earning income from contributions.  Simply put – it’s hard to get paid to create something that will be given away for free.  The labor proposition  Being part of something greater than oneself offers a source of meaning and purpose.  The approach to open-source contribution in the tech sector has a long and storied history of people who have shared their specific knowledge or skill and expected nothing in return but the satisfaction of work and its potential impact. Contributing to open-source projects, however, is difficult for most people who are exhausted trying to make ends meet and pay bills by working their day jobs. As a result, creators and contributors for many open-source projects are well-intentioned volunteers who have limited time and attention to allocate.  Read more: Bitcoiners Are Biohacking a DIY Coronavirus Vaccine (2020)  The paradox here is clear: Altruistic projects often cannot be bankrolled by those who would be most helped by those innovations. Physical and emotional constraints, economic barriers, class antagonisms and scarcity of leisure time limit contribution and support from the individuals whom the projects are intended to benefit most.  The accumulation of wealth  In a proprietary organization, considerable work is extracted from the worker, which is not matched in compensation.  The pursuit of wealth is not inherently bad, and the idea that successful wealth creation must be unethical, selfish or greedy is false. Predatory profit motives are the problem – when a hierarchical system of revenue and earnings becomes more important than an equality of social prosperity, the system grows inhumane.  Read more: We're Freaking DAOing It': The People Who Think DAOs Are the Future of Work  A common word heard in the world of open-source and cryptocurrency is meritocracy. A meritocracy ensures that work of value yields wealth of equal value. In other words, it’s a system that should reward members strictly based on their contribution toward the system’s goals. Sadly, in a proprietary system whereby economically or politically advantaged actors can opt in to increase wealth without contribution, meritocracy is impossible.  Once individuals are tricked into mistrusting open-source methods as a potential pathway to wealth, they face a sobering truth: In our society, it’s far easier to contribute to the proprietary system and be happy with the drip-feed of trickle-down economics than to attempt an alternative approach.  Enter DAOs  DAOs are the best model we have to create an open-source meritocratic framework for promoting unbiased knowledge, work and wealth. In practice, here is what DAOs can offer as solutions to the above conditions.  Openness  DAOs revolve around a shared mission that inspires their members to value the significance of their work.  In a DAO, all information required to understand the mission, goals and objectives is openly available to all.  The strategy by which a DAO accomplishes its mission can be contributed to, and updated, via open forums in real time, allowing a DAO to redirect and iterate its own strategic path quickly and efficiently.  Labor  DAOs can publish specific and granular tasks that contribute to their greater goals and mission. This work should be denominated in levels of granularity based on risk and required resources so that the DAO supports the spectrum from livable wages to an hour of one's time.  By providing access for global contributors, the DAO provides more opportunities for scalable employment scenarios than a traditional company hiring full-time employees in its own region.  Available work becomes an open meritocratic marketplace that’s remunerated based on contribution to the overall mission and goals of a DAO and serviceable by anyone.  Wealth  Through the tokenization of labor hours and expertise, members are compensated fairly, based on contributions, resulting in a meritocratic reward and governance system.  Over time, assuming the mission of a DAO is truly valued by society, the desire to contribute or govern the DAO will increase and drive demand for consistent participation.  As the DAO succeeds, so do all its members.  DAOs present a clear path to coordinating meaningful labor opportunities and ethical wealth creation in an open-source design, and will reshape the future of business.

Keepers is a decentralized transaction automation service that allows developers to automate any smart contract function using custom triggers. Developers can set predefined conditions that Keepers continuously checks, and when those conditions are met, it will trigger the smart contract’s function.  VRF, on the other hand, uses on-chain “randomness” that can generate fair in-game outcomes in blockchain games or randomly select governance participants for specific tasks.  “Having Chainlink VRF on Fantom allows our ecosystem developers to incorporate tamper-proof unpredictable outcomes into their dapps,” Michael Kong, CEO at Fantom Foundation, wrote in a Telegram message. “That (can) be for GameFi and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) or other real-world use cases.”  VRF has already handled more than 7 million requests from decentralized applications on other networks, developers at Chainlink Labs told CoinDesk.  Chainlink handled over $1.85 billion in 5,630 transactions over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. The transaction count has declined since a peak last month of 10,440 over a 24-hour period amid a slide in the broader crypto market.  DeFi applications on Fantom hold just under $1 billion in locked value, according to DeFiLlama. That is a steep fall from a peak of $12 billion in January.

42422161,r2LAFyEJPPW5TW9PoT4tnc,1656505771,Deutsche Bank: Crypto Free Fall Could Continue Because of the System’s Complexity,"The free fall in crypto markets could continue because of the system’s complexity, Deutsche Bank (DB) said in a report Wednesday.  Getting token prices to stabilize is difficult because there are no “common valuation models like those within the public equity system,” the bank said. In addition, the cryptocurrency market is highly fragmented, according to the report.  Furthermore, speculative trades are likely to involve the simultaneous use of several coins, which increases spillover effects, the bank said. Whatever liquidity might exist in these markets could quickly evaporate, which would erode confidence in prices and increase the likelihood of contagion, it added.  Macro risk is also a concern.  As bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are speculative, high-risk assets, they are “disproportionately affected by central bank tightening,” the report said.  The U.S. Federal Reserve is nowhere near finished with its tightening cycle, the European Central Bank (ECB) has “yet to lift off,” and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is facing “market pressures that are adding turmoil even to safe-haven markets,” the note said. These macro factors are amplified by the possibility of a recession in the U.S. and investor pessimism. Both are harmful to speculative assets, and any macro shock could test the recent lows in cryptocurrencies prices and “reignite contagion risks in the DeFi ecosystem,” it added.  The bank’s economists predict a U.S. recession in 2023 and peak headline inflation in the country of 9.1% in September; economists have compared today’s “global stagflation winds” with the 1970s, when energy was the top-performing industry. “Unless bitcoin is becoming digital oil” its performance may be modest during a period of high inflation, the bank added.  Deutsche Bank notes that bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets have been increasingly correlated with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 stock indexes in recent months. Based on its past correlation with the S&P 500 and using a baseline S&P 500 price of 4,750, the bank says BTC could reach $28,000 by the end of the year, adding that this would be a 32% rally from current levels, but still less than half of its all-time high from last November.

While other cryptocurrencies organized at least some price rebound during June, ZEC submissively continues to fall. Does this mean the weakness of the cryptocurrency and should it be considered for investment? From March 2022, the ZEC price fell by 70%. The main buyers support from which it was possible to continue the growth trend is the $91 range. It was from this range that the ZEC growth wave began in January 2022. However, after sellers broke the $91 liquidity zone with a weekly candle from 9 May, things went badly for ZEC cryptocurrency. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ewv1OwKF/ Sellers ran the distance from $91 to $57 with small weak weekly candles and did not make an effort in the form of increased volumes. Thus, as of 13 June 2022, the ZEC price is near a new strong liquidity range, from which the market situation may change dramatically. The $57 range was the main buyers&apos; support in 2020. Consolidation over this range gave some confidence to buyers to achieve growth with the final target of $372. Therefore, at least from this range, we should expect a price rebound to $91 and the beginning of global consolidation in a wide range. Until the price confidently breaks the mark of $91 and is not fixed above it - planning higher growth targets is not yet in time.

42393808,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBM8n,1656502200,A Major Crypto Exchange Abandons Ethereum: Is the World’s Computer Falling Behind?,"Last week, crypto derivatives exchange dYdX announced that it will be leaving the Ethereum ecosystem and launching its own blockchain within the Cosmos ecosystem. According to dYdX’s founder, a new chain will allow the platform to provide the best possible experience for its users – enabling the platform to more easily customize things like fee structures and transaction speeds.  The new chain will replace dYdX’s current platform built atop StarkWare, an Ethereum scaling solution platform that uses ZK-rollup technology to allow for quick and cheap transactions.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Even as layer 2 networks like StarkWare are expanding Ethereum’s capabilities at a rapid pace, updates to the core Ethereum protocol are lagging, and competition from other smart contract ecosystems is growing fiercer by the day.  DYdX’s decision to leave Ethereum has been viewed by some as evidence that the original smart contract network simply is not moving fast enough to accommodate the demands of a maturing crypto ecosystem.  DYdX’s path – which saw the platform outgrow Ethereum’s layer 1 blockchain, move to StarkWare, and then leave Ethereum altogether – provides insight into two competing visions for the future of crypto: the app chain versus the global computer. It’s also a case study into the weaknesses of Ethereum layer 2s, which are generally viewed as a saving grace for a network that has famously struggled to scale.  The decentralized order book  The advantage of decentralized finance (DeFi) is that it enables users to transact without any intermediary. In the case of a decentralized exchange (DEX), this means users can buy and sell assets without a bank dictating prices and taking fees. DYdX might not have the same name recognition as DeFi giants like Uniswap, but it has quietly grown into a major force within DeFi due, in part, to its ability to facilitate large trades without slippage.  Slippage is a quirk of automated market makers (AMMs) – the go-to technology that powers decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap and Sushi, behind the scenes.  Read more: What Is an Automated Market Maker?  AMMs were one of the early DeFi innovations enabling users to exchange currencies without middlemen. With AMMs, buyers and sellers do not dictate token prices. If a user wants to swap one token for another on an AMM-based exchange, they are linked up to a liquidity pool containing a mix of both currencies. To swap, say, USDC for ETH, a user drops some ETH into a USDC/ETH pool and is given an equivalent amount of USDC from the pool in exchange.  A simple mathematical formula determines the exchange rate based on how many tokens of each type sit in the pool.  Slippage happens when a swap is large enough to throw the ratio of currencies in a pool way out of whack – distorting the exchange rate. While AMMs are generally useful for retail traders, slippage can render them useless for some institutional-sized swaps.  DYdX avoids all of these issues by using a more traditional order book model to facilitate swaps, directly linking buyers and sellers of tokens and contracts. This method removes slippage, which means dYdX has proven better for institutional-sized trading.  On the negative end, maintaining an order book (a list of buy and sell orders) and directly matching up counterparts can require more computation (and therefore higher fees) than the simpler AMM-type systems.  We won’t wade into the debate of order books versus AMMs here – the order book also has its disadvantages.  The most important takeaway is that order book DEXs like dYdX are particularly maladjusted to the slow speeds and high gas fees of networks like Ethereum. These sensitivities are what originally drove dYdX away from Ethereum’s layer 1 mainnet to the Ethereum layer 2 StarkWare.  Read more: How to Read an Exchange Order Book  Beyond layer 2  Ethereum layer 2s like StarkWare were supposed to come to the rescue for platforms like dYdX.  In general, layer 2s expand the capacity of blockchains like Ethereum by processing transactions on a separate blockchain. These separate chains execute transactions, bundle them up, and hand them back down to the layer 1 chains where they get officially recorded onto the ledger.  DYdX explained why it initially moved over to the platform in a 2020 blog post: “Ethereum can process around 15 transactions per second (TPS), which is not enough to support the hypergrowth of DeFi, NFTs, and more. While Ethereum 2.0 will theoretically boost network speeds to 100,000 TPS, base layer scaling is still a while away. In the meantime, Layer 2 scaling solutions – in the forms of Rollups – free up Ethereum's base layer by offloading execution, leading to reduced gas costs and increased throughput without increasing network load. StarkWare’s dYdX integration combines STARK proofs for data integrity with on-chain data availability to ensure a fully non-custodial protocol”  When they hand the transactions back down to the layer 1 chain, layer 2s tend to use fancy math and other strategies to prove that the transactions are “true” – meaning they haven’t been faked or tampered with. DYdX’s layer 2 solution of choice – StarkWare – leverages a technology called STARK proofs to significantly decrease fees and increase speeds.  But layer 2 solutions also have their weaknesses.  One of the oft-mentioned shortcomings of layer 2s is that they rely on a single node operator – or sequencer – to coordinate whatever activity gets passed down to the layer 1 network.  Sunny Aggarwal, the co-founder of the Cosmos-based Osmosis exchange, explained to CoinDesk, “Almost every rollup platform right now is all single operator – whether it’s Arbitrum, Optimism or StarkWare.” In other words, one company or computer, rather than a distributed network of node operators, is responsible for bundling up the transactions that eventually get passed down from the layer 2 chain to the mainnet.  According to Aggarwal, “Rollup systems give you safety – like, you can trust the execution of the code is correct – but they don't give you liveness nor censorship and front-running resistance.”  Aggarwal’s main contention is that layer 2s – while they have undeniable speed and cost advantages relative to Etheruem’s mainnet – tend to suffer from a single point of failure as a result of their reliance on sequencers.  If, say, StarkWare decided to censor certain transactions before passing them down to Ethereum’s mainnet, they could do so. A layer 2 sequencer can also go offline, and (if they are malicious) front-run transactions – previewing buy/sell activity to squeeze out better deals for itself.  While these theoretical concerns may not seem especially prescient to everyone, Aggarwal noted that with Osmosis, “our thesis has always been that eventually, applications are going to get big enough that they're going to want to go on to their own chains.”  Safety vs. sovereignty  The dYdX move underscores a difference between Cosmos and Ethereum, ecosystems which posit distinct visions for the future of crypto.  Ethereum positions itself as a kind of global computer. Anyone can build programs that run on this computer, and the security of the entire system extends to each of these apps.  Cosmos’ vision of the future is one of so-called app chains: blockchains that are purpose-built for specific use cases. Rather than one specific blockchain upon which many apps are built, Cosmos is a family of distinct blockchains that easily communicate and swap assets back and forth.  The primary advantage of a system like Cosmos is customizability. By spinning up your own Cosmos chain, you can set parameters specific to a given use case.  One way dYdX plans to take advantage of this customizability is by making platform fees scale with transaction size, which is more like how a centralized exchange works. Today, gas fees are based on network traffic and computational complexity – they don’t increase or decrease depending on how much money is at stake. DYdX also plans to customize how blocks are issued in its new system. By moving onto a new chain, dYdX says its core technology will be better optimized to handle its order book exchange model as it grows.  The primary disadvantage of the app chain model proposed by Cosmos tends to be security. On Ethereum, thousands of computers compete to add blocks to the chain and validate transactions. This heavily decentralized security model is one of Ethereum’s core selling points.  Most Cosmos chains, on the other hand, have dozens – not thousands – of nodes keeping things secure. Cosmos chains tend to have vibrant governance communities, but issues have, from time to time, slipped past the Cosmos validators responsible for chain upgrades and security.  By moving to Cosmos, dYdX is charting its path in a world where sovereignty – rather than absolutist guarantees around security – are prized above all else.  Dan Edlebeck, the founder of Cosmos-based Sei Network, told CoinDesk that on Cosmos, “You can guarantee you are in more control of your chain itself.”  While centralized security levers may sound like sacrilege to decentralization maximalists, Edlebeck describes it as a feature rather than a bug. As he explained, “You can make customizations at the validator level – whether it's their geographic location, or whether it's the technical specifications that they need to have to be able to run your validator – you can customize your chain for your own needs.” According to Edlebeck, these security customizations allow chains to run more efficiently without sacrificing decentralized security in its entirety.  Other visions for the future of crypto (and crypto security) exist as well: Polkadot has a unique, multichain “hub-and-spoke” model for sharing security between distinct blockchains. Solana takes a more centralized approach to security, but it claims to provide a more streamlined experience for app developers and users.  While each vision has its maximalists – it seems likely that, at least for the foreseeable future, they will need to coexist. But we should expect to see more projects leaving (and joining) Ethereum as crypto’s uncertain future continues to take shape.

Partners from New York-based Teneo Restructuring have been called in to handle the insolvency, the person said.  Three Arrows Capital, which was founded by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies in 2012, has suffered heavy losses in the recent sharp downturn in the crypto markets. The possibility of insolvency was reported in mid-June after the firm, which is also known as 3AC, incurred at least $400 million in liquidations.  Crypto brokerage Voyager Digital (VOYG.TO) issued a default notice to 3AC this week after the fund failed to make required payments on loans of 15,250 bitcoins and $350 million in USDC. Voyager's shares had plunged after it disclosed its exposure to 3AC.  3AC has been an active investor in the digital asset industry in recent years with investments across non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance, layer 1 blockchain firms and crypto companies.  Teneo declined to comment, and 3AC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  The court order and Teneo's role was reported earlier by Sky News.

Bitcoin fell to $19,880, revisiting levels from last week, before gaining some $300 at writing time. The asset fell to as low as $17,710 in mid-June as investors took money off risky assets amid a poor macroeconomic environment.  Inflation rose to a nearly 37-year high of 10% in Spain, denting investor sentiment in Europe. The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.84%, while Germany’s DAX dropped 1.84%. Stocks in Asia also declined, with Japan’s Nikkei falling 0.92%, and the Shanghai Composite shedding 1.40% despite some Chinese cities reducing quarantine requirements on Tuesday.  Wells Fargo said in a Tuesday note that a fall in equity prices was likely to “take time to repair.” In the U.S., the S&P 500 has fallen more than 20% from its December 2021 peak – putting it in a technical bear market – as inflation hit a four-decade high in May.  “For now we favor patience before committing new cash to equities,” the Wells team wrote. “With the Federal Reserve just beginning the tightening cycle, we have shifted our investment preferences away from economically sensitive assets and toward more quality-oriented and defensive assets.”  The Wells note came as New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said Tuesday he expects the “U.S. economy to slow,” according to MarketWatch.  Bitcoin has traded similar to risky technology stocks in the past year, meaning further downside in popular tech bets could see the world’s largest cryptocurrency dropping to levels previously seen before 2018.

The US comes in second place in Coincub.com&apos;s inaugural crypto-crime ranking and had 14 documented instances of attributable crypto crime, with proceeds over $2 billion.

The United Kingdom takes fifth place and is a global hub for crypto fraud as lax corporate regulations allow fraudsters to obfuscate the source and destination of funds. In 2021 alone, 7,118 cases of crypto fraud were reported. Meanwhile, Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, the British Virgin Islands, and Seychelles were listed among the remaining top 10 countries for crypto crimes.

Coingecko records indicate that as the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,129.50, a decrease of 0.5% over the past week and still slightly down from the previous day&apos;s high of $1,228.88. Even though the ETH/USD pair fell to an intraday low of $1,170.23 during Tuesday&apos;s session, bulls were able to keep prices above this area. The market has been dominated by bulls for the past few days. A 40 percent increase in 10 days can undoubtedly be read constructively, but it is essential to consider all possible outcomes. According to the chart, ETH is currently trapped below the resistance zone on the daily time frame.

It dropped to as low as $0.42 on April 6th, a 38% decline from the high. The market has been consolidating between $0.42 and $0.50 since April 6th. The next few days will be crucial for the market as it attempts to break out of this consolidation phase.

In addition to the tax cuts for issuers, the draft law approved by State Duma members also establishes tax rates on income earned from the sale of crypto assets.

The market also has been taken over by the bears, Bitcoin has been hovering around the $20,000 mark for the last 24 hours. Other market movers have also retraced in their respective charts. Technical outlook of the coin continues to point towards negative price action suggesting that price of Solana can fall further. Selling pressure in the market has started to mount indicating that price of SOL could again take a dip. The global cryptocurrency market cap today is $977 Billion with a fall of 0.2% over the last 24 hours. Since, Solana has now fallen beneath the $40 mark, SOL could now be prone to further fall.

Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $38, if buying strength returns then SOL could attempt to revisit the $38 price level. If SOL manages to remain above the $38 mark for a substantial amount of time then $44 could be possible on the chart.
