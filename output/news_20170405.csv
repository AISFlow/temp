42379423,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87iox,1491428781,Litecoin Moves Within 5% of its SegWit Activation Threshold,"The litecoin network appears to be on the cusp of enacting a technical upgrade that would boost the capacity of its network.  At press time, just over 70% of litecoin's miners were signaling support for Segregated Witness, a technical innovation first pitched as a scaling solution for the bitcoin blockchain, but that has not yet seen similar levels of adoption from its miners.  With increasing support, litecoin is now just 5% shy away from achieving the 75% network consensus threshold required for activation. On bitcoin, by contrast, just 31% of miners are signaling that they would support the software upgrade.  Notably, litecoin first began offering miners the ability to flag support for the proposal on 3rd February, nearly three months after the code was released to the bitcoin network.  Going forward, two large mining pools have yet to signal their intention to activate SegWit, and thus could ultimately prove the deciding vote.  LTC1BTC and BW.com comprised nearly 22% of the litecoin network hashrate (12.2% and 9.8%, respectively), at time of writing. This means that only one would need to make the switch in order for SegWit activation to occur, an advent that could add new data to bitcoin's long-stalled scaling debate.  Other mining firms that aren't signaling for the upgrade include Bitmain's Antpool, LTC.Top, WeMineLTC and ProHashing.  Debate context  The way forward, however, may not be easy.  For one, it seems unlikely LTC1BTC will take the plunge. Jiang Zhuoer, founder of LTC1BTC, stated in a recent interview that his pool will not support SegWit. He also said he believes other large pools were unlikely to make the jump.  Further, if the activation threshold is reached, it will need to stay at or above this figure for at least 8,064 blocks (about two weeks based on litecoin's 2.5-minute block interval). This means there could exist a situation in which the activation threshold is met, but isn't maintained for the required duration to implement changes to the protocol.  Still, litecoin creator Charlie Lee is in favor of SegWit adoption. So far, he has even gone so far as to make the pitch to China-based mining pools to adopt SegWit in a letter made public yesterday.  Lee wrote:  ""I also believe that the market is waiting for litecoin to get SegWit and the price will react positively if SegWit is activated. Seeing all these other altcoins pump is definitely disheartening. So let's give the market what it wants.""  In response, investors seem to have responded positively to the news.  Amid the uptick in miner support, litecoin traders pushed the price 24.7% higher to $11.17. Litecoin's market cap now stands at $559m, making the coin the 5th largest digital currency.

42379412,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87idd,1491413166,Philly Fed President Praises Blockchain's Authentication Abilities,"The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia weighed in on the possibilities of blockchain tech in a new speech this week.  Entitled Fintech: Revolution or Evolution? and presented to engineering students at the University of Pennsylvania, the talk found Philly Fed President and CEO Patrick Harker lauding the technology for its ""tremendous potential"".  Further, Harker suggested he believes blockchain could become a way banks and institutions more effectively manage risk in the future.  He told the audience:  ""From my perspective, however, its real value is in authentication, not on distributing a virtual currency. And the implications of having a distributed ledger that offers virtually failsafe data storage are huge on the risk management side for any business.""  Still, it was clear from the remarks that Harker believes blockchain will ultimately become an enabling platform for existing incumbents.  For example, he argued fintech companies will never completely disintermediate trusted third parties and brokers of money.  ""Likewise, no matter what happens in the world of fintech, you still need a trusted broker of money. The roles may change and adapt, but someone needs to be the source of funds and credit,"" he said.  Elsewhere, Harker was more bearish on the idea of a digital currency operating outside of the purview of the government.  ""On the other hand, one of the things you’ll see with digital currency is how wildly the value swings. The question is, 'Will there ever be a digital currency that is stable enough to become as widely used as a government one?' he said.  He further argued that privately held digital currencies would perhaps be unable to manage a large money supply, adding:  ""Unless a government issues it, the answer is likely that no, digital currencies won't drive out our own any time soon.""

42379409,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87iZr,1491406831,Blockchain Land Registry Tech Gets Test in Brazil,"Blockchain startup Ubitquity has announced it will overhaul the land registrar offices of two Brazilian municipalities by embedding land ownership information into the bitcoin blockchain.  The pilot program will pair the Delaware-based startup with the Brazilian Cartorio de Registro de Imoveis (Real Estate registry) in the municipalities of Pelotas and Morro Redondo. Ubitquity's recordkeeping system will embed hashes of detailed information like property address, owner, parcel number and zoning classification into the bitcoin blockchain using the Colored Coins protocol.  According to the founders, the pilot program is an effort to move away from paper-based records toward a 100% computer-based solution. Records stored on the bitcoin blockchain are immutable meaning they are not susceptible to theft, corruption, damage or fraud.  Ubitquity has been given an exclusive contract by the Cartorio de Registro de Imoveis to provide the registration services. If the pilot is successful, Ubitquity plans to franchise its software to other municipalities interested in migrating records on the blockchain.  In correspondence with CoinDesk, Ubitquity founder Nathan Wosnack shared the first Brazilian property embedded into bitcoin blockchain using the real estate registry platform (though it declined to make the specifics public). Published 30th March, the entry contains the property information of a doctor living in the city of Pelotas.  A similar land registry initiative is being pursued in Sweden where the Lantmäterie land registry authority is partnering with blockchain startup ChromaWay to record property deals on a distributed ledger.  The interface allows for banks to connect with individuals to streamline the process of buying and selling property.

42379418,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87ihP,1491404108,Building 'The Blockchain': Developers Aren't Giving Up on Big Ambitions,"Even as bitcoin's block size debate rages on, enterprising developers are looking beyond the infighting to focus attention on what's ahead.  Adem Efe Gencer is one such developer. A research assistant at Cornell University's center for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, he believes blockchain technologies will come to be used on a broad scale to track everything from land records to deeds, fine arts and even precious metals.  But as Gencer explained, if we put each each and every asset on its own blockchain, we risk splitting the mining power that secures these transactions and their history. Putting everything on one blockchain, he countered, will lead to cluttering.  So, how will blockchains handle all of these multiple assets? Should we have dedicated chains? Or is there a better way?  At the Financial Cryptography and Data Security conference in Malta yesterday, Gencer offered a solution, outlining an approach called ""service-oriented sharding"".  Sharding is basically a way of splitting data into parts, and then storing those parts across multiple databases for better throughput.  Gencer explained that service-oriented sharding applies that same idea to blockchains, so that transactions for different assets run on independent subchains. Users only keep track of the subchains they are in, and mining is combined.  Gencer told CoinDesk:  ""We want to shard the blockchain with respect to services, so that each shard contains the transactions of only the related service, but not the other services.""  Sharding for tomorrow  Gencer and his colleagues have currently implemented sharding on a blockchain called Aspen, designed to run on bitcoin-NG, a protocol for scaling bitcoin.  Developed by Cornell researchers in 2015, bitcoin-NG, which breaks up certain functions of block creation, was one of the more radical proposals to increase network performance.  Still, Gencer said service-oriented sharding could just as easily be applied to bitcoin, ethereum or another blockchain protocol, as it simply re-orders how data is stored.  ""In terms of mining, this change will have no effect,"" Gencer said.  He believes that sharding is the future of blockchains, but points out that it is not easy to do. If you naively try and get rid of some part of transaction history, a blockchain will lose its tamper-resistant, immutable structure.  With Aspen, he said, it is possible to maintain all those properties while requiring less computing power and providing un-fragmented, unified security.  Nodes for the masses  Gencer was not the only one at the conference examining a future where every single car and property is being traded on a blockchain.  Dmitry Meshkov, a researcher at distributed systems firm IOHK, presented yet another idea for making blockchains more manageable, proposing a way to solve what he called the problem of ""big state"".  As Meshkov described it, the problem is that you can’t store an entire copy of a blockchain on commodity hardware. What's more, he explained, you don’t need all of that data to validate a single transaction anyway.  If Alice wants to give some asset to Bob, you only need to know whether or not Alice has enough tokens to allow a transaction to go through.  Meshkov presented a solution called ""cryptographic authenticated data structures"" as a way to verify transactions more cheaply. Essentially, the approach adds a proof with a transaction, so you know with certainty whether a transaction is valid, or not.  The solution, he says, will reduce the memory requirements of a blockchain, enabling everyday mobile phone users to validate transactions.  Solutions like these promise to make blockchain more accessible to a broader community of users. They also bring into perspective that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin may one day take a backseat to other assets traded on a blockchain.

42379396,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fdR,1491397167,Decentralizing Central Banks: How R3 Envisions the Future of Fiat,"The future of central banks could be either on an open, permissionless blockchain or a closed, permissioned distributed ledger, according to a paper released today by bank consortium R3.  That is, assuming anything changes at all.  Already, the global institutions that actually issue national currencies have moved vast amounts of the paper money they print to digital, centralized ledgers.  But as more and more central banks around the world reveal details about their interest in blockchain and other distributed ledgers, the very real possibility of central banks decentralizing is being seriously studied by academics.  Most recently, a research paper published today by R3 and revealed exclusively to CoinDesk presents a detailed picture of the benefits and detractions of two of the most popular strategies being considered  In conversation with CoinDesk, report author and chair in economics at the University of California Santa Barbara, Rod Garratt, detailed the impact he believes blockchain and other distributed ledgers could have if implemented by central banks.  ""Most central bank money is digital. Reserves are digital,"" Garratt said, adding:  ""What really distinguishes the idea of this sort of central bank digital currency is the idea that, while it may be generated on the central bank balance sheet, it can transact off the central bank’s balance sheet.""  Currently, most central banks inject new currency into the economy through a number of monetary policy actions, including buying government bonds that, in turn, supply securities dealers with cash. This then makes its way into the market through a number of mechanisms.  But the issuance of fiat money on a blockchain or other distributed ledger opens up a wide range of new possibilities, according to Garratt, who is also a member of R3’s academic advisory board.  Canada trial  Revealed for the first time in the new paper, titled ""CAD-coin versus Fedcoin"", are new details about Project Jasper – a secretive project being undertaken by the Bank of Canada, R3, and others.  First announced last year, Project Jasper was designed to be implemented in a series of phases, the first of which concluded at the Payment Panorama conference last year.  As detailed in the paper, Project Jasper’s CAD-coin was designed to have a neutral impact on the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy, by settling all CAD-coin exchanges at the end of each day.  In the phase one simulation, this was accomplished by six private Canadian banks pledging cash collateral – which was pooled into an account held by the Bank of Canada – in exchange for an equal amount of CAD-coin to be exchanged throughout the day.  For the test, CAD-coin was issued on a permissioned version of the ethereum blockchain set up to use the proof-of-work mining built into Geth, but with the platform's token, ether, removed. However, R3 is also developing its own distributed ledger, Corda – also without a cryptocurrency – intended to further streamline a number of financial transactions.  According to the report, banks were identified by a public address in this early CAD-coin implementation, but live transactions would have required much more information, including a complete list mapping the names of banks to public addresses in the distributed ledger.  The report states:  ""With CAD-coin, the central bank again acts as the gateway to conversion from central bank money to CAD-coin, but privacy at conversion is not required. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Central banks typically have the authority to monitor payments transactions in their role as overseer of a systemically important financial market infrastructure, so complete privacy is not a reasonable objective.""  The case for Fedcoin  Permissioned distributed ledgers, though, are not the only potential solution being seriously discussed as a possible replacement for central bank-issued currencies.  Initially proposed by blogger JP Koning in 2013, the concept now known as Fedcoin, has already been personally embraced by David Andolfatto, vice-president of the US Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis.  Whereas CAD-coin is presented in the R3 report as a permissioned solution with cryptocurrency cashed out at the end of every day, Garrett positions Fedcoin as a permissionless solution that is actually swapped out with traditional currency, resulting in a new form of sovereign currency.  Though it is important to note that the US Federal Reserve has not formally expressed any interest in issuing the cryptocurrency first described by Koning, central banks around the world have begun to explore it and similar concepts.  Last June, the Federal Reserve co-hosted representatives from 90 central banks gathered in Washington DC to discuss the possible network effects of moving global currency to a blockchain or distributed ledger.  Garratt distinguishes CAD-coin from Fedcoin in that CAD-coin is being designed as a temporary tool to expedite the movement of traditional digital cash, whereas Fedcoin as described by Koning would be a substitute for currency already in circulation.  According to the paper:  ""Fedcoin is intended as a retail payment solution, while CAD-coin is intended as a wholesale payments solution: it does not trade on a public network, nor is it consumer facing.""  Obstacles and risks  Preventing the adoption of central-bank issued cryptocurrency are a number of potential problems, not least of which are large-scale runs on banks, similar to those that triggered the Great Depression.  Joining a growing list of skeptics who warn of the difficulties facing adoption, Garrett enumerated a number of obstacles between central banks and their use of cryptocurrencies.  For example, he positioned the Fedcoin concept as particularly susceptible to runs on the bank, since the process of making a withdrawal would be simplified to a potentially dangerous degree in times of economic uncertainty.  ""Unless the central bank put limits on peoples’ ability to convert money into Fedcoin,"" wrote Garratt, ""there could be significant swings in the composition of the monetary base which could have serious implications for liquidity.""  Meanwhile, the adoption of a CAD-coin style currency by the Bank of Canada or elsewhere could be inhibited by uncertainty among some banks that others will follow suit – a crucial component of the potential efficiencies that Garratt suggests could be freed up by moving fiat money to a distributed ledger.  Beyond central banks  Already, a number of global central banks have publicly expressed interest in fiat currency issued on a blockchain, while at least one company, eCurrency, has been established for the sole purpose of helping central banks digitize their currencies.  Further, non-central-bank-related solutions are also being developed.  For example, the cryptocurrency Tether is specifically designed to be pegged to the US dollar without the need of a central bank, while Bitshares’ SmartCoins are intendedhttps://bitshares.org/technology/price-stable-cryptocurrencies/ to be pegged to any number of assets, including gold.  Garratt concluded by embracing a 'more the merrier' philosophy:  ""If you have multiple countries offering central bank digital money that can be transferred on this ledger, then suddenly you have the possibilities for very efficient clearing and settlement in multiple currencies.""

42379402,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fkz,1491393557,Ethereum Prediction Market Project Gnosis Sets ICO Launch Date,"An ethereum prediction market project is moving forward toward its public debut.  Following its beta launch last fall, Gnosis, now a team of eight, will become the first incubation project of ethereum development firm ConsenSys to spin off into a separate startup, according to co-founder Stefan George and strategist Matt Liston.  The firm has further revealed that its token sale (or ICO) is now set for 24th April, with the fundraising target set at $12.5m.  If you're not familiar with the concept, prediction markets are a potentially useful type of betting tool – one proponents say could help forecast future events, such as sports games or political campaign outcomes, to greater societal benefit.  Platforms such as Gnosis and Augur aim to help drive the idea forward by experimenting with different decentralized models that can't be shut down by outside actors. At least, that's the idea. (It's worth noting that there has been some debate over the utility of decentralized prediction markets.)  George told CoinDesk:  ""Now Gnosis is becoming it's own entity. It will still have very strong ties to ConsenSys, but we are now our own company.""  The company has now moved its headquarters to Gibraltar in anticipation of the launch.  Building apps  Developers can already build applications on top of the Gnosis platform using a JavaScript libraryhttps://github.com/ConsenSys/gnosis.js/ that allows them to communicate with the app's smart contracts and oracle platform (which pulls in information from the outside world).  ""It makes it easy to make interfaces for prediction markets,” George explained.  One example app from the team lets users broadcast their bets and predictions to Twitter with the help of a bot.  The Twitter bot lists all of the market questions on which users can place bets.  For example, George scrolled to the question, ""Will Ethereum surpass Bitcoin in market cap in 2017?"" and placed a bet of 10 ether by responding with the tweet ""10 higher ether"".  With the help of the self-sovereign identity system uPort, the bot responds with a QR code for the bet, which the user can then harness to finalize the transaction.  Though it might seem like an odd idea to broadcast predictions to Twitter, the motive is for users to build alternative interfaces that might make it easier to interact with the platform, or to make their activity more public, if they choose.  Admittedly, though, not every participant would want to broadcast their bet to the world. One use case that's often put forth by prediction market advocates is that the new markets could encourage people with insider information to bet based on little-known information.  What's more, if they know something others don't, they might place a larger bet.  Other than that, apps built on top of Gnosis are already cropping up, such as a sports app. There's also predART, with which users can valuate art prior to sale at auctions.  Teasing out tokens  The team has plenty to juggle with currently, including some unknowns, such as a new token sale structure that will be used to bootstrap the platform.  Liston explained that their idea for a ""modified Dutch auction"" extends the amount of time in which users can purchase tokens. The hope is that it's not just a few players, or big entities, snapping up all the tokens, say, within the first five minutes, as has been the case for other sales.  The idea is to draw the process out, while still preserving a cap on the total number of tokens sold to buyers.  As shown in a recent CoinDesk survey, more than 50% of ICO users support the idea of a hard cap on transactions.

42379397,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87ffx,1491390011,Bitcoin's Broken Record: Why the Scaling Debate Isn't Going Away,"When a bitcoin startup proposed a new way to solve bitcoin's scaling debate this week, it provoked an all-too-familiar response.  Conversation escalated on Twitter, lines of argument formed quickly, rumors spread of mass-media deception, and ultimately, a proposal was put forth that perhaps only provided evidence that disagreement among the tech's supporters is the new norm.  That's the old script that replayed when bitcoin startup Purse proposed upgrading bitcoin to support so-called 'extension blocks', adding yet another proposal to the now years-long scaling debate that dates back to 2015.  As pitched, extension blocks would allow a way for bitcoin users with different needs from the network to live under their own rules – essentially enabling nodes to select their own block size while remaining on the same network.  As it only requires a soft fork – a change that wouldn't require all the network's nodes to update – the team framed it as a way to get around bitcoin's current deadlock on how best to scale the digital currency's transaction capacity.  In response, some developers pointed to online discussions around similar proposals from months (or even years) ago that revealed the potential security flaws of the plan. Others argued it could take another year to test and deploy the solution, whereas another solution, SegWit, has already been through that process.  In other words, not everyone agreed that the new plan was a safe one.  Mixed reactions  This seems to be par for the course for the industry, which saw two similar events take place last week.  During this time, the idea the network may put in motion a hard fork – a controversial method of upgrading that could risk splitting bitcoin into two networks – continued to see discussion, though proposals seemed to borrow from a slew of competing ideas.  Wang Chun, co-owner and chief administrator of mining pool F2Pool, submitted an idea to the bitcoin mailing list that was unusual since it would not trigger until 2020. With a 32MB block size increase locked in, he argued the bitcoin community could use a soft fork, to change it to a smaller size ahead of the activation date.  Chun's idea, however, like Purse's, wasn't really a new one. He said that he brought it up at a scaling meeting in Hong Kong last year, and Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr once issued a similar concept.  His letter ended with a warning that those following the debate have also likely heard before:  ""We must code something right now, before it becomes too late.""  In short, it was another proposal without full support, prompting more than 70 replies, an unusually high number for the mailing list, with multiple variations of 'yes' or 'no'.  A few days later, Rootstock (RSK) developer Sergio Demian Lerner posted another hard fork proposal. In a sense, it was different from Chun's in that it wrapped together two changes: SegWit (the solution favored by core developers) and a hard fork to double the block size parameter (an idea often voiced by miners).  Though it won some supporters, the reaction was again mixed. Not all developers saw it as a novel idea. Further, because it advocated for a hard fork, many simply weren't willing to entertain the idea.  ""These are all hard forks, so they are dead on arrival for any sort of near-term activation, unfortunately,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop told CoinDesk, adding:  ""If you're going to split with a contentious hard fork, the decent thing to do is pick a new name, pick a new address prefix, enable replay protection and fork peacefully.""  Meet and repeat  Fork proposals might not be the only industry event to be in a bit of a loop.  Another scaling meeting is coming up in May, one which Digital Currency Group (DCG) co-founder Barry Silbert has confirmed the VC firm will host. However, not everyone is heralding it as a milestone.  While at first listed on a possible list of attendees, bitcoin investor and Bitcoin.com operator Roger Ver said that he doesn't plan to attend.  ""I agree that there have been plenty of meetings already, and none ended in a lasting agreement,"" he said.  Such a meeting would add to a history of approaches to the scaling solution that have included a number of in-person meetings.  Of note is the famed 'Hong Kong agreement' that saw some developers and miners agree on a roadmap that was then met with delays and disagreement from those that didn't attend.  Since then, appetite for in-person meetings is perhaps low – a fact exacerbated by the fact no one wants to be seen as in charge of the protocol or its decision-making.  Blockstream CEO Adam Back rejected DCG's invitation on the grounds that he believes there's an implication he represents bitcoin's volunteer developer team.  ""There is a persistent incorrect assumption that Blockstream [is the same as] Core, or that, by implication, I speak for bitcoin developers. Neither of these are correct, so if that expectation is in the room it will just feed the false narrative,"" he wrote in an email to the investment firm, which has a stake in Blockstream.  The silver lining  This constant confusion over who represents what, or speaks for who, has added increasing difficulty to the discussion. Indeed, irrespective of the proposals, there is even the matter of who gets to decide what agreement is, even if there was consensus around a technical fix.  Among the options are users, businesses, miners and developers, though determining who even falls into which category, as evidenced by exchanges above, remains a challenge.  Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille showcased the perception issue in his response to Chun's proposal, in which he suggested that developers don't have the power to force bitcoin users to accept a change, such as a 2MB block size increase.  He argued that if Bitcoin Core ""blacklisted"" network activity in a new software version, for example, users could simply choose not to download the new software version if they didn't support the change.  Still, it could be argued that the negative sentiment has nonetheless galvanized historic levels of open discussion.  With at least three scaling ideas offered in the past week, adding to many others over the last few years, it seems there's no end in sight to the ongoing conversation – but that that might not be a bad thing in the context of technical innovation.

42379387,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fTN,1491382816,Blockchain Capital Releases New Details on Ethereum ICO Token,"An investment memorandum published yesterday provides new details about an effort from venture capital firm Blockchain Capital to use digital tokens as a funding vehicle.  The document outlines the company's plans for its recently announced Digital Liquid Venture Fund offering, an investment vehicle set up with the aim of raising $10m as part of a $50m fund that would provide capital to startups.  The 'initial coin offering' (or ICO) will raise funds via a sale of ethereum-based 'BCAP Tokens' with a face value equal to $1 and capped at a maximum of 10 million tokens. Annual fees are set at 2.5% for management and 25% for performance.  A token buyback provision will also enable Blockchain Capital to purchase open-market tokens in the event that their market value falls below their net asset value.  The offering is set to begin on 10th April, with the firm utilizing the TokenHub platform developed by Argon Group, which will also act as the offering's underwriter. Legal advisory services will be provided by London-based Allen & Overy LLP.  The funds raised from the ICO will be split 50/50 between new ventures and a reserve account used for follow-up investments. Assuming a successful ICO, the fund will invest in 10–20 companies or token-based projects, contributing $500,000 per deal.
