42395456,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxBSP,1651448158,First Mover Asia: Singapore’s Distaste for Retail Crypto Spooks Institutional Money,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin returned to where it started the weekend.  Insights: Singapore's growing crypto regulatory scrutiny has raised concerns among institutional investors.  Technician's take: BTC's trading range could persist into the following week.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $38,594 +2.2%  Ether (ETH): $2,844 +3.9%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Filecoin FIL +8.5% Computing Ethereum Classic ETC +7.3% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP +6.8% Computing  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Bitcoin returns to late Friday levels  Bitcoin investors continued their recent dour mood this weekend amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a widely expected, half-point interest rate hike by the U.S. central bank this week.  The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was recently trading at about $38,400, up 2.2% for the past 24 hours, but approximately where it started the weekend. Bitcoin finished April down 17%, its worst month yet in a ragged 2022 for cryptos.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, followed a similar weekend pattern and was trading at roughly $2,840, up about 3.9% over the previous day but little changed from late Friday. Most other major cryptos were recently rising. Terra's luna token and SOL climbed over 5% and 7%, respectively at one point. Popular meme coin DOGE jumped nearly 6%. Trading was light as is often the case on weekends.  ""At the moment, there are no major bullish catalysts on the horizon and BTC is likely to grind in this range or break down lower before more aggressive accumulation can begin,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote to CoinDesk. ""The lack of bullish catalysts is still evident and U.S. equities have shown weakness as well as the U.S. dollar index rose. All these factors continue to weigh down BTC.""  DiPasquale noted that the Federal Reserve's likely decision to try to tame inflation through a more hawkish rate increase ""could result in price volatility."" The Fed is also expected to explain how it will reduce its portfolio of mortgage and Treasury securities, which ballooned to $9 trillion during the pandemic.  Crypto declines in recent days have largely dovetailed with major stock indexes as investors veer away from riskier assets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 4% on Friday. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were off 3.6% and 2.7%, respectively. Gold was up slightly. The Nasdaq 100, an index of mostly tech, biotech and health-care companies, plummeted 13% in April.  Economic growth has slowed worldwide, a result of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. On Friday, the European Union reported that the economies of 19 countries that use the euro grew by just 0.2% during the first quarter. The news followed the announcement that the U.S. economy had grown by a sluggish 0.4% over the same period. Rising energy prices and supply chain delays exacerbated by the Russian offensive have hampered businesses worldwide.  With bitcoin failing to hold the $42,000 level last week, DiPasquale was measured in his expectations for the coming days. ""We have continued to see $38K levels acting as support but continued testing of this range may result in a breakdown toward $35K-$32K,"" he wrote, adding: ""Bulls will want to see the bleeding stop and serious buyers stepping in before they can be confident of a trend reversal.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,131 -3.6%  DJIA: 32,977 -2.7%  Nasdaq: 12,334 -4.1%  Gold: $1,896 +.08%  Insights  Singapore's less crypto friendly environment  Three Arrows Capital is the latest crypto firm that’s decided to call Singapore quits and move to Dubai.  “The energy in Dubai’s digital asset industry is electric right now,” fund co-founder Su Zhu told CoinDesk during the Crypto Bahamas conference. “We have decided to move our Three Arrows headquarters to Dubai, and I’m looking forward to meeting more technology startups.”  “For a while, Singapore was making pro-crypto decisions, but now something’s changed course,” added Kyle Davies, the fund’s other co-founder.  To be sure, on paper Singapore hasn’t advanced any new rules that would affect a fund like Three Arrows Capital. The government has been clear that its policy position is to create a “conducive environment for such activities to flourish in Singapore.”  But that is for institutional capital. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has also been clear that it doesn’t approve of retail investors getting deeply involved in crypto.  “We have taken a tough line on unfettered access to retail public because retail investors should not be dabbling in cryptocurrencies. Many global regulators share similar concerns about retail exposure to cryptocurrencies,” Ravi Menon, the agency’s managing director, said in a recent interview, adding that it has granted retail crypto licenses but they come with strict terms and conditions.  Funds like Three Arrows Capital don’t deal directly with retail crypto, as they aren’t open to non-institutional or non-accredited investment.  So why the long face?  It might have something to do with DeFiance Capital, one of Three Arrows’ peers in the city.  In March, DeFiance Capital was placed on an Investor Alert List by MAS. DeFiance Capital isn’t sure why that happened, and MAS won’t give CoinDesk a clear answer.  Putting a fund on an investor alert list, which has negative connotations, and not explaining the reasoning, isn’t a good look.  It also might be the beginning of problems in doing business in Singapore.  Visas for foreign staff are increasingly difficult to attain, and the logical narrative of the city being a massive beneficiary of Hong Kong’s capital and talent flight isn’t necessarily shaping up with those in traditional finance also looking at Dubai as the next hub instead of Singapore.  At the same time, Dubai is making the relocation process as easy as possible with visas sponsored by the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) special economic zone processed in less than a week. Plus, the DIFC has a parallel legal system  Technician's take  Bitcoin Momentum Weakens; Support at $35K-$37K  Bitcoin is testing support at around its 100-week moving average, although upside momentum has slowed over the past month. The cryptocurrency could remain in a wide trading range until a decisive breakout or breakdown occurs.  BTC is on track for an 18% decline this month and is down about 40% from its all-time high of nearly $69,000 reached in November.  Most technical indicators are neutral on the daily and weekly chart and bearish on the monthly chart. That could increase the risk of a breakdown in price, especially if support at $37,500 fails to hold.  A series of higher price lows since Jan. 24 has supported buying activity on dips. Still, resistance at $46,710 has capped rallies over the past three months.  For now, BTC is on watch for a countertrend reversal signal next week, per the DeMARK indicators, which typically precedes a brief upswing in price.

The decision came in response to a community vote on a proposal to the foundation from contributor Molly White, who goes by the user name GorillaWarfare, argued that accepting donations in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, bitcoin cash (BCH) and ether (ETH) signals endorsement of digital coins, which are “inherently predatory” as investments and don’t align with the foundation's commitment to environmental sustainability.  Excluding new accounts and unregistered users, of the fewer than 400 users who voted, 232 to 94, or 71.17%, supported no longer accepting crypto.  White argued that Wikipedia risked damaging its reputation by accepting crypto donations, citing the decision earlier in the year by non-profit peer, Mozilla, to pause accepting donations in crypto.  Wikimedia accepts bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and ether via BitPay. White singled out bitcoin and ether’s need for enormous amounts of energy, while noting that there are other “eco-friendlier” cryptocurrencies, although they are less widely used.  Crypto miners, which use tremendous amounts of computing power to validate transactions using proof-of-work, have been criticized for damaging the environment.  However, miners have been actively countering such criticism by using more sustainable energy sources for their mining operations. Furthermore, bitcoin supporters argue that miners can help drive a change to clean energy.

42422840,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qM3h,1651419082,"BAYC Team Raises $285M With Otherside NFTs, Clogs Ethereum","After much ado, Yuga Labs held its long-awaited digital land sale on Saturday evening – a public debut for its “Otherside” metaverse project. While the resulting land rush generated roughly $285 million for the company, it also created some of the highest gas fees in the history of the Ethereum network: Investors have spent over $176 million on fees alone in the past 24 hours.  Otherside is the biggest product launch yet from the company best known for creating the Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible token collection. During last night’s sale, traders snapped up a limited supply of 55,000 “Otherdeeds” NFTs, which represent titles to plots of virtual land in a forthcoming 3D social space.  They cost about $7,000 each, and were only available for purchase in ApeCoin (APE), Yuga Labs’ official cryptocurrency. On secondary marketplaces like OpenSea, the cheapest listed price for an Otherdeed was around 7 ETH (roughly $19,000) at publication time.  The night was a win for the firm, which previously raised $450 million from venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, and a kind of slow-burning disaster for everyone else. (The Otherside raise was worth even more last night – around $320 million – but the value of APE has since fallen.)  The company issued a public apology in the wake of the fee-related chaos:  “This has been the largest NFT mint in history by several multiples, and yet the gas used during the mint shows that demand far exceeded anyone’s wildest expectations,” reads a statement posted to Twitter. “We're sorry for turning off the lights on Ethereum for a while.”  The statement also gestures at the idea of refunding traders' gas fees, though it's not yet clear what that process would look like.  The average fee for an Ethereum transaction typically scales with the overall congestion of the network; when traders scramble for the same tokens at the same time, prices go up for everyone. It’s a phenomenon known as a “gas war” – users compete to have their transactions processed at the top of the miners’ queue.  Per a bespoke calculator on the blockchain data site Dune Analytics, the average gas price was hovering around 800 Gwei early Sunday morning, with spikes in the realm of 6000 and 7000. During these waves, a simple transaction (say, sending a few dollars’ worth of crypto to a friend) could cost upwards of $3,000.  The expensive evening threw into question Ethereum’s long-term viability as a host for large-scale NFT projects; Yuga Labs even floated the idea of building its own dedicated blockchain at the end of its apology thread:  “It seems abundantly clear that ApeCoin will need to migrate to its own chain in order to properly scale. We'd like to encourage the DAO to start thinking in this direction.”  Of course, the firm has taken great pains to assert that it doesn't actually control the ApeCoin decentralized autonomous organizatrion – maybe it can donate some of last night’s windfall to the cause.

42421605,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoiIH,1651416600,Crypto Venture Capital's Rejection of Venture Capital and ‘The Box’,"I really like Bloomberg’s ""Odd Lots” podcast. The hosts are quite good (Tracy and Joe) and they consistently bring on impressive guests (readers might remember the Reserve Asset 3.0 piece inspired by Zoltan Pozsar on an “Odd Lots” podcast).  Well, on this Monday's episode, “Odd Lots” had Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). He is probably best known for his exceptional hair, but he also founded crypto exchange FTX. He ranks among crypto’s richest and, given he studied physics at MIT, probably one of its classically brightest (whatever that means). On the podcast, he compared crypto “yield farming” to a “box” that lets you take out more money than you put into it.  Magically.  That quote hit me like a ton of bricks, but then he tacked on a swipe at venture capital’s investment approach that irked me. His view on venture capital is shared by many, but that view has been muddied by the introduction of crypto. I’m not suggesting SBF is wrong necessarily. What I am suggesting is that crypto venture capital … is … just … not really … venture capital.  That (and maybe more …) below.  – George Kaloudis  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  I’m a bitcoiner. According to the internet purist’s set of rules, that means that I need to shun altcoins and “crypto” altogether. But honestly, that’s boring.  I’m not boring, so I pay attention to the hellspawn landscape of “crypto this, NFT that and blockchain everything” that Bitcoin inspired. Part of that means that I listen whenever SBF speaks. I want to zoom in on two specific things he talked about in the podcast mentioned in the introduction: 1) The Box and 2) venture capital.  'The Box'  On the podcast, Matt Levine (every newsletter writer’s hero) asked SBF to give “an intuitive understanding of yield farming.”  Sam responded with:  You start with a company that builds a box… they probably dress it up to look like a life-changing, you know, world-altering protocol that's gonna replace all the big banks in 38 days. Maybe for now ignore what it does and pretend it does literally nothing. It's just a box. You can then put a token in The Box and you take it out of The Box. Alright so, you put it into The Box and you get an IOU token for having put it in The Box and then you can redeem that IOU back out for the token.  Ok … a weirdly simple example using a somewhat cynical tone: The Box seems kind of meaningless, a technologically enabled piggy bank.  He went on:  In like five minutes with an internet connection, you could create such a box and such a token, and [decide] that it should be worth $180 based on the effort that you put in. In the world that we're in, if you do this, everyone's gonna be like, ‘Ooh, Box token. Maybe it's cool.’ Then it appears on Twitter, and it’ll have a $20 million market cap …  Then the yield farming kicks in, and The Box starts giving out tokens as interest payments to people who have put tokens in The Box.  Say the total amount of money in The Box is $100 million, and it pays out $16 million a year in X tokens – that's a 16% return. That's pretty good. So people put a little bit more in. And maybe that happens until there are $200 million dollars in The Box… And now all of a sudden everyone's like, wow, people put $200 million in The Box! This is a pretty cool box, right? Like, this is a valuable box as demonstrated by all the money that people have apparently decided should be in The Box. And who are we to say that they're wrong about that?  Uh … who turned the heat up in here? This is a scathing take on yield farming that you’d only expect from its harshest critics. That it came out of the mouth of one of crypto’s richest was surprising. SBF basically said that yield farming consisted of:  Step 1: Put money in The Box.  Step 2: Wait.  Step 3: ???  Step 4: Profit.  I have nothing more to add, because I think these quotes largely stand on their own. I wanted to write about these quotes to highlight that individuals should exercise caution when it comes to deciding on partaking in yield farming or not. Your yield might just be grounded in nothing except The Box. Which can be fine, as long as you understand that and are OK with it.  Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained  Crypto venture capital vs. venture capital  After talking about yield farming on the episode, SBF answered a question about how he thought the “institutional or quasi-sort of venture capital money” found the next big thing in crypto. SBF offered to pull it back further and answer how he thought venture capitalists found the next “anything they’re going to invest in.”  He said:  You get a bizarre process. Venture capitalists see what all their friends are chattering about. And their friends keep talking about this company or this token, and they start FOMOing [fear of missing out-ing] and then their LPs [investors in the venture capital fund] are like, yo, have you made us a lot of money off of this company or token yet? And, the answer is no, we haven't invested in it. But that's not a good answer given what question your LPs just asked. So instead you're like, oh boy, you're gonna be excited about what we have done and/or will do. And then you find a way to get into that token and/or company.  Again. Cynical. But for all my personal cynicism, I don’t completely agree with SBF here. I think that even though he tried to opine on venture capital in general, he still offered up his crypto venture capital take. Because crypto venture capital and traditional venture capital are different.  Venture capital is a form of equity investing that targets startups and early-stage companies in emerging industries. Once a venture capital equity investment is made, so begins the five to 10 year process of business growth, development and execution. Only then do venture capitalists and their LPs make a return. Rinse and repeat. Venture capital funds have a long-term time horizon just as the private equity and private credit funds do.  Crypto venture capitalists, when they’re not investing in the equity of companies operating in the space (companies like Coinbase), are investing in tokens. And when they’re not getting in early on presales, they’re getting in later when their LPs ask if they’ve invested in certain projects (as SBF suggested).  This model is not really venture capital at all. If a token a venture capitalist buys after an LP asks then spikes in price, the venture capitalist can harvest returns by selling on the open market, maybe after years but sometimes after months.  This is one of the places where crypto token venture capital deviates from traditional venture capital. The lack of liquidity of traditional venture capital investment commitments is part of the reason investors expect “good” returns; they are taking a risk by tying their money up for at least five years, and investors feel they should be paid for that risk.  With token investments, crypto venture capitalists can get in and out of trades as easily as hedge funds do. That’s what I think SBF was describing, but that’s not venture capital.  And that’s just one of the differences. There is much more that can be written that deserves attention. For example, there probably is a level of 'FOMO' in traditional venture capital that is spurred on by the immense amount of capital that has been raised in recent years looking for investments. There’s also something to be said about the headline fundraising numbers advertised by token investing venture capitalists, but that’s for another time (and perhaps another author).",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/01/crypto-venture-capitals-rejection-of-venture-capital-and-the-box,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7375bacc280ccccdce0a0928089e2442ce63c085-4894x3581.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bots had swarmed the popular non-fungible token (NFT) minting tool known as Candy Machine earlier Saturday with an unprecedented tsunami of inbound traffic: four million transaction requests and 100 gigabits of data every second – a record for the network, one person at the Solana Foundation said.  For reasons not yet clear, this swarm pushed validators out of consensus. Block production became impossible and the network went dark at 4:32 p.m. ET. By 11 p.m. ET, validators (coordinating through Solana’s Discord channels and a Google doc created by one of the validators) restarted the cluster at slot 131973970.  Co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, who said he was traveling during much of the fracas, credited the validator community for spearheading mainnet recovery. He'd caught flak on Twitter Saturday for allegedly being ""MIA"" during a network crisis.  Unlike last September’s 17-hour outage, Saturday’s hard fork restart did not resolve with new-and-improved code populating across the validators. It simply picked up where the network flopped seven hours prior.  In preparing for the restart validators mulled whether to implement code that would temporarily block Candy Machine transactions. Some debated in the Discord whether such a move constituted censorship. Regardless, it would only be effective if two-thirds of validators opted in. Few appeared to do so on Saturday night.  Other parts of the ecosystem quickly moved to bolster their defenses. At 11:36 p.m. ET, Metaplex, the key steward of Solana NFT infrastructure and one closely intertwined with Candy Machine, tweeted it would soon deploy a 0.01 SOL “botting penalty” to help NFT projects stanch excessive traffic.  Solana ecosystem services like Phantom wallet and decentralized exchange Mango Markets struggled to stand up in the aftermath as RPC node providers plodded back online.  The outage contributed to a bloody, albeit brief, drawdown in SOL markets. Solana’s native token crashed to a 24-hour low of $83.13 about three hours into the outage before climbing back toward $89, according to CoinGecko.  Solana core developers have yet to diagnose what went wrong Saturday or how the apparent botting attack overcame existing safeguards to stymie consensus, a member of the foundation told CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,SOL,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | FORKS,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/01/solana-goes-dark-for-7-hours-as-bots-swarm-candy-machine-nft-minting-tool,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/501ddebe9b5cc1dc844043d81a6aa8f8f25164cd-4273x3207.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chiliz Technical Analysis The CHZ price is within a bear breakout formation following losses on April 6. The wide-ranging solid bear candlestick set the motion, drawing sellers and triggering panic-selling that saw prices slide from April peaks. As CHZ trends lower, the underlying sell pressure is also high. Notably, CHZ bear bars are banding along the lower BB suggesting strong bear momentum. At the same time, the divergence from the 20-day moving average indicates strong volatility. As a result, from the CHZUSDT candlestick arrangement, sellers may unload provided prices are below $0.20. The immediate bear target stands at $0.16. What to Expect from CHZ? The crypto market is free-falling, and CHZ is no exception. The odds of Chiliz token retesting Q1 2022 lows remain elevated.The post Chiliz Free-falling, Dumps 40% from April Peaks as Sellers Target $0.16 first appeared on Crypt...",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | CHZ,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | CHZ,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/chiliz-free-falling-dumps-40-from-april-peaks-as-sellers-target-0-16/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=chiliz-free-falling-dumps-40-from-april-peaks-as-sellers-target-0-16,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
