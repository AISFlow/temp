But can the currency sustain real, daily life, as opposed to -- say -- someone who's looking for a unique Hogwarts library, reddit gold or the world's smallest solar-powered car?  That's what Forbes tech writer Kashmir Hill hopes to find out over the next week. As of May 1, she's embarked upon a seven-day personal experiment to see if she can get by living by bitcoin alone, starting with five purchased with the help of Coinbase.  So far, the San Francisco-based Hill has had to walk the two-and-a-half miles from home to work (no bitcoins for BART), waited two hours for a bitcoin-enabled delivery of Indian food via Foodler, cheated a bit by using her Verizon iPhone and relied upon the free coffee at the office (no bitcoins for Starbucks either).  With four bitcoins remaining at the end of day one, Hill had already started to worry about a possible crash in bitcoin value. She closed her first day's post with a bitcoin address and the message, ""Will work for bitcoin for food. Taking tips here.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/02/san-fran-on-0714-bitcoins-a-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b80f3880738de5de5942c7f47462ee601540a9c-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424845,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWnph,1367508517,'Luxury marketplace' for bitcoiners launches,"Forget trying to trade a few hundred dollars or euros for bitcoins using a circuitous exchange process: Alan Silbert has a vision for helping well-off fans of the digital currency convert some of their wealth hundreds or thousands of bitcoins at a time.  How? By creating BitPremier, the first-ever online ""luxury marketplace"" using bitcoins for transactions.  Launched today, BitPremier offers exclusive listings -- a Trump SoHo Hotel condo, an ocean-view resort property in the Bahamas, a hand-signed LeRoy Neiman serigraph -- for sale, with the transactions handled in bitcoins rather than in dollars or other currencies.  ""It's important to us to be the first mover out there,"" said Silbert of the venture, which is backed by his brother Barry's Bitcoin Opportunity Fund. ""In our networks, a lot of people want to get their hands on bitcoins, and there are also a lot of people with bitcoins who need a place to spend them.""  (Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Fund has supported numerous other bitcoin-based businesses, including BitPay, CoinLab, Tradehill, Bitspend, Coinsetter and OpenCoin.)  Prices on BitPremier's site are listed in BTC first, with the comparable cost in US dollars updated regularly to reflect current exchange rates. Alan Silbert says the company's focus is to bring together high-end, bitcoin-minded buyers and sellers in a way no other business has done so far.  ""We saw there was nothing out there quite like this,"" he said.  BitPremier acts as an intermediary, keeping the process anonymous on both sides until all the terms of the transaction are agreed upon. The seller's listing is reviewed first to verify it's valid before being posted online. Would-be buyers send their bitcoins to a BitPremier escrow account, where the funds are held until both sides are ready to sign off on the deal.  For its involvement, BitPremier takes a 5 percent transaction fee before transmitting the buyer's funds to the seller.  Silbert emphasizes that both parties still need to take care of other legalities on their own outside the actual exchange of funds. For example, with a real-estate transaction, buyers and sellers are advised to also consult with a real-estate professional and/or lawyer to ensure all local paperwork and regulatory requirements are in order.  Like many bitcoin businesses, BitPremier went from idea to reality quickly. Alan said he began researching bitcoin heavily earlier this year after learning about it from his brother. Shortly afterward, the two began ""furiously"" exploring innovative bitcoin business ideas.  The result -- just a few months later -- is BitPremier.  Alan, whose background is in commercial banking, says he's always had a ""passion"" for personal finance. And the bitcoin concept resonated with him like nothing else.  ""I really think this is a game changer,"" he says about the currency. ""It aligns with the whole direction the world is going in these days ... democracy, the power of the crowd.""  Bitcoin has revolutionary potential to let people decide even more for themselves, he explains, adding, ""People want control over their own destinies.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/02/luxury-marketplace-for-bitcoiners-launches,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc5c46bcf1eea10fc4c6c65eb71ddc2ecfd97299-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424854,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWnzh,1367503131,Does bitcoin encourage crime?,"Does Bitcoin encourage criminal activity?  No more than a £20 note does.  The position bitcoin finds itself in today is similar to where Napster and other peer-to-peer music services were 13 years ago.  There’s much shouting right now about how the digital currency is apparently sometimes used for criminal purposes. Those quick to level those accusations might want to ask, “Have you seen what the big banks have been up to?”  Banks have been found guilty of deliberately mis-selling insurance products, fixing some interest rates and knowingly laundering money for terrorists and murderous Mexican drug dealers. In that context, accusing bitcoin of criminality does seem a bit rich.  It also sounds rather like the way the entire internet was dismissed early on … as useful only for pornography and crime.  If you think about it, it wasn’t really the offering of free music that made Napster important: it was the operation’s structure that made it really interesting. The impact of peer-to-peer systems – which match the structure of the internet – has been huge to date. And now bitcoin can be seen as the ultimate implementation of peer-to-peer infrastructure.  What’s more, given the state of “real” currencies, the limitations of bitcoin are starting to sound like advantages.  What, no easing?  Economists complain that, because bitcoins are limited to 21 million units, there is no way to inflate or deflate the economy. After years of watching euros, pounds and dollars being printed in order to refinance bankrupt banks, some might see this as a feature not a bug. Certainly we cannot say anything intelligent about the currency’s long-term inflationary or deflationary prospects until all its units are issued and being traded.  What, no sovereign, central bank?  Some have claimed that money fleeing from Cyprus was the reason for bitcoin’s recent peak in value. Whether that’s true or not, the reality is that – right now – having a government backing your currency is not necessarily an advantage. We don’t know who is really behind bitcoin, but we can be pretty sure they’re not going to swipe a third of people’s savings in order to refinance traditional banks. If governments continue to refuse to reform bank regulations while at the same time paying to keep them in business, there remains a strong argument not to invest in their currencies.  What, no 3 percent fees?  Whether bitcoin survives or not, someone is going to go after the banks’ ridiculously high charges for moving money around the internet. No bank ever pays anything like 3 percent transaction fees and there is no earthly reason why we should either. Since the earliest days of the internet, there has been a search for the Holy Grail of micropayments online. None of those available today offers the advantages of a system like bitcoin.  Consequently, there is no doubt the banks will fight to keep their grip on their 3 percent. Some banks have already closed the accounts of bitcoin-related businesses.  Complaining there are no legal uses for bitcoins misses the point in much the same way as when that claim was made against Napster. It’s possible that more bitcoins are already being used legally than illegally: investors (whatever their legality) are getting involved and holding onto the currency rather than converting it straight into cocaine. Could it be that we’ve seen the end of bitcoin’s illegal heyday?  More and more ordinary, garden-variety, not-at-all-black-market services have been joining the bitcoin parade. Last week, one of the big dating sites began taking payment in the currency. Reddit does it, and so does WordPress. How long might it be before your mom starts buying coffee or cupcakes with bitcoins?

42424837,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWnbh,1367500428,Canadian bank drops BTC exchange,"Yet another bitcoin exchange has had the plug pulled on its bank account. Unlike Bitfloor, which went off-line last week, however, Canadian exchange Virtex is still operational – and its founder told us how.  Two-year-old, Calgary-based Virtex was contacted by the Royal Bank of Canada on April 5 and told that its bank accounts would no longer be operating, according to Virtex's founder, Joseph David, Virtex’s founder. He said he wasn't told why. However, he thinks it was because Virtex did not yet have the right documentation.  ""The problem that the banks have with us isn’t the bitcoin,"" David said. ""It's the fact that when you’re accepting money, specifically cash deposits at the bank, you must have a license to operate as a Money Services Business.""  These licenses are granted by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), and are required by any company conducting foreign-exchange dealing or money transfers.  Even though bitcoin is an unregulated system, fiat currencies are regulated. This means that if a company like Virtex wants to exchange bitcoins for another ""regular"" currency, it is regulated by the governing body that oversees dealers in that currency.  David says that MSB licenses are difficult to get. The company had applied for one when it opened its account with the RBC, he said, but it took over a year to acquire. It partnered with technology consulting firm TAYPE international, which was its first investor and is also a Canadian-registered MSB.  ""The application for the license was taking so long, and we needed to operate in the meantime,"" David says. ""Our mistake was not telling them (the bank) that we were applying ... We did not proactively go to them and say, 'We're pursuing a license, we'll have it to you shortly.' ""  The company apparently didn't tell CIBC or TD either. In August 2012, both those banks shut down its accounts with Virtex. The company managed to stay in business because it had agreements with several banks. Even though others have pulled the plug, Bank of Montreal (BMO) and Scotia bank stand by it for the time being.  David said Virtex is taking care to keep its remaining banks happy, submitting all of its anti-money laundering and ""know-your-client"" (KYC) documents to those banks to avoid any further difficulties.  Many exchanges can take payment in different ways, including email transfers, direct debit and credit, wire transfers and bank drafts.  ""Depending on the method, it has a corresponding regulation,"" said David, adding that he is fastidious about how Virtex takes payments. The firm will accept money in cash, in person.  ""If you are just accepting cash, then you have just one set of rules (to abide by),"" he said.  Although Scotiabank and BMO are the only banks supporting cash-in-person payments to Virtex right now, the exchange is able to take Canadian dollars, because the Canadian banking network includes online bill payment. The company is registered with all of the online banks as a payee, meaning that anyone can send Virtex money by treating the transaction as a bill payment in their online banking system.  Even that process is not easy, however.  ""That requires extensive KYC documents, and our approval, our discretion,"" David said. ""We basically have to approve you that you're not a criminal. That's the problem with this business. It attracts fraud. It's a tough business to be in.""  David won't take email money transfers using Canada's popular Interac system, which he calls a ""recipe for disaster"" because it opens him up to fraud.  ""We were victims of email money transfer fraud in the early days,"" he noted.  Virtex is now the only Canadian exchange to carry an MSB license, said David, and the stakes now are particularly high. The firm has processed $16 million (CAD) in volume over the past two years, but the bulk of that has come through in the last three months during bitcoin's massive rally. The exchange currently processes around 1,000 bitcoins each day,  RBC declined to comment on the issue yesterday.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/02/canadian-bank-drops-btc-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ESEA runs servers for CounterStrike and other games in the US and Europe. It said it was running a very limited test using its client software to include Bitcoin mining. Although it decided not to go through with this dubious move, it said a rogue member of staff secretly sent out the software and was collecting the gains.  By the time ESEA management realised what was going he had made $3,713.55. The company is giving this amount to the American Cancer Society and matching it with its own funds. It is also adding $3,713.55 to prize money for the season’s League.  In a statement titled ‘Bitcoin fiasco’  , ESEA admitted it had failed its members. It said the furore over Bitcoin led the company to begin testing it on two admin machines in April. On April 13, it killed off the project but an unnamed admin continued running the code for his own benefit.  Just what ESEA thought it was doing even condsidering turning customers’ machines into a zombie network is of course another question...

42424852,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWnxh,1367487423,"Chris Dixon: ""I believe in Bitcoin""","Silicon Valley loves innovation. But when it comes to new tech businesses in the finance sector, it's been stymied at multiple turns: by the power of Wall Street, by the difficulty of competing with capital-flush banks and hedge funds, and by an intimidating regulatory environment.  That's what a leading venture capitalist believes ... and that's why he sees bitcoin as the missing piece of the internet commerce jigsaw. The bitcoin market, he says, is finding a strong appetite for investment for a reason.  ""I believe in it,"" said Chris Dixon, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a leading venture capital firm for technology startups, noting that he's invested ""a fair amount"" in bitcoin.  One thing that's exciting about digital currencies, he said during the recent Disrupt NY 2013 gathering, is that they could enable anonymous payments much as the internet enables anonymous interactions.  ""The internet is an anonymous network ... with a payment system on top of it, the credit card system, that requires verifying identity,"" Dixon said. ""Which is why you have so much fraud and other kinds of friction that are added to the system ... and the exciting thing about these new kind of currency schemes is ... that you have sort of a fully anonymous payment system grafted onto an anonymous network.""  With the first wave of interest in bitcoin now passed, a second wave of businesspeople is now taking notice, Dixon said.  ""(N)ow what you're seeing ... if you just talk to the smartest people in Silicon Valley now, some of the best entrepreneurs are thinking about getting heavily into it,"" he said. ""So I think you're going to see another wave.""  Among the possibilities to explore: merchant services, PayPal-type services, exchanges, bank models and more. The prospect of digital currencies, Dixon said, resonates with the tech community.  ""I think for a lot of people in tech, finance has been this very frustrating area,"" he said, ""because it's such a massive market ... We see what happens on Wall Street, it's very corrupt ... and, number three, is it's so highly regulated that when you do try to go and create a financial tech startup you often run into regulatory issues.""  Dixon cites the example of ""a whole wave of peer-to-peer lending"" that emerged on the scene around seven years ago or so, but never developed as its initial champions envisioned.  ""(T)hey're still around but (in) a completely different form than they were intended to be,"" he said. ""Basically, the supply side now is all hedge funds ... it turned out the regulatory issues were too much for these companies to actually let individuals make loans.""  Dixon continued, ""The thing is, these things always get shut down by regulatory issues or by the fact that the hedge funds and the banks have a much lower cost of capital because they get bailed out by the governments and all sorts of other things ... So I think a lot of the reason people in California are so excited about bitcoin is it's sort of a release valve for all this pent-up frustration ... It's like, OK, finally something interesting is happening in financial tech stuff.

Simon Hausdorf, the owner of the exchange, is currently awaiting legal action from the German prosecutor's office, which has said he is suspected of fraud in connection with bitcoin sales via Bitcoin-24.  The exchange's customers began complaining earlier in the month, after the site began refusing withdrawals.  ""Our Service is momentarily not available,"" the website stated.  On April 12, one customer posted a threat of legal action against Hausdorf.  Eventually, posting under his username TAIS46 on the popular Reddit site, Hausdorf blamed the problem on German and Polish banks.
