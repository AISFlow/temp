42377689,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX737PH,1413237350,Imperial College London to Offer Credits for Bitcoin Projects,"Imperial College London and Entrepreneur First (EF), a pre-seed investment programme, have announced a new partnership focused on bringing bitcoin technology to students.  Under the agreement, the institutions will support student innovation in the field of cryptocurrency, including bitcoin. The programme will be available to students from a range of departments, including mathematics, computing, engineering and business.  Where appropriate, students will be encouraged to pursue bitcoin-related ideas as credit-bearing elements of their degree courses. For example, students can apply to carry out bitcoin projects as group projects or individual projects, both of which are compulsory elements of many degree courses.  Bitcoin Prize Fund  In order to motivate students and support the initiative, Entrepreneur First has created the Imperial/EF Bitcoin Prize Fund, which will provide cash awards of up to £3,000 to the best bitcoin-related projects. It will also offer additional funds to purchase equipment used in the projects. Grants of up to £500 are available, along with mentoring sessions and other forms of support.  EF said it is already funding one Imperial alumnus working on a bitcoin startup that came out of his studies and the partnership should allow it to fund even more.  ""Stewart Douglas, an Imperial computing graduate, and Rory Grieg, who dropped out of Goldman Sachs to join EF, are building a bitcoin lending platform that allows holders of bitcoin to earn a return on their holdings. They started work on [TradeMore] late this summer and are currently pre-public launch,"" Matt Clifford, co-founder of EF, told CoinDesk.  The newly formed Imperial Bitcoin Forum, comprised of a cross-departmental group of researchers, will work alongside EF to provide mentoring and education to students engaged in bitcoin-related projects.  The forum formally launches today, at an event that will include prominent members of the bitcoin community. James Smith, CEO of Elliptic, and Iain Stewart, the brains behind the 'proof of burn' concept, will address the event.  Bullish on the block chain  EF said it is excited and bullish both on block chain technology and the college's decision to become a key part of the UK technology ecosystem.  ""We're bullish on the block chain because – whatever the fate of bitcoin-as-currency – we think it has the capacity to transform vast swathes of activity that today are insecure, inefficient or expensive,"" EF said in a blog post.  EF said it is bullish about Imperial too, because it is a world-leading university open to innovation and partnerships.  Clifford said:  “Our mission at EF is to support Europe’s most talented founders to build disruptive technology. We’re bullish on the potential of the block chain to transform whole industries, so partnering with one of the world’s leading universities to encourage more innovation in this area is hugely exciting for us.""  Clifford told CoinDesk that, while EF is very excited about bitcoin and other block chain applications from a commercial perspective, it is also interested in people who find bitcoin fascinating from a technical point of view. Clifford explained that he was originally inspired by the MIT Bitcoin Project.  ""I'm an MIT alumnus, so when I saw MIT launch their bitcoin project earlier this year, I was very keen to try to encourage a similar trend in the UK,"" Clifford said.  William Knottenbelt and Rob Learney, co-convenors of the Imperial Bitcoin Forum argued bitcoin has already evolved from a niche ""cyberlibertarian"" hobby into a powerful peer-to-peer platform that could revolutionise the way financial services and contracts are delivered around the globe.  ""Imperial and EF are uniquely placed to bring together the multidisciplinary expertise required to deliver innovation in this emerging area,” Knottenbelt and Learney said in a statement.  Learney told CoinDesk the forum was started as a result of a year-long partnership and co-supervision of student projects into bitcoin. Learney and Knottenbelt quickly realised the technology behind bitcoin was ""fascinating and important"" from an academic perspective, but it had numerous disruptive commercial applications.  Learney explained:  ""We reached out across the university to find out if there was interest in other departments and were overwhelmed by the positive response. On the back of this, we have brought together professors, academics, researchers and teaching fellows in the departments of Mathematics, Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Computing and the Business School.""  He said the short-term ambition of the forum is to become the focal point for multidisciplinary activities related to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.

42377687,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX737T3,1413230854,Former Senate Aide Joins Coinbase as US Government Liaison,"Bitcoin services provider Coinbase has hired an in-house liaison to US policy makers who are drafting digital currency legislation.  John Collins joins the San Francisco-based company as head of government affairs in Washington, DC. He previously worked as a senior advisor to the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, which almost a year ago held the first congressional hearing on digital currency.  Today’s announcement  by Coinbase calls attention to the increasing need for more open and informed dialogue about bitcoin among regulators and public officials, saying:  “Our team has always invested a great deal of time and energy to help educate and inform regulators and other public officials about bitcoin. […] As more policymakers seek to understand its core value and promise, that responsibility has become increasingly large.""  Rise of the regulator  The bitcoin ecosystem has advanced tremendously in 2014 and its leaders have emerged across all sectors. As such, the pressure is on regulators to give more careful consideration to the rules of the game as businesses and consumers alike continue to grow the bitcoin economy at a rising pace.  It’s also urging key players to take the lead on keeping an open conversation with regulators, when regulators don’t themselves.  Bitcoin wallet and block explorer service Blockchain, another leader in the field, made a similar move last month when it brought New York business attorney and commercial litigator Marco Santori on board as its global policy counsel.  Santori described his new role as an “educational mission” to close the knowledge gap between digital currency users and lawmakers like Ben Lawsky, about whose controversial BitLicense proposal Santori has been vocal on behalf of the bitcoin community.  Moving the needle  Coinbase’s work reflects a lot of the progress in the bitcoin ecosystem. This year alone it has gone into business with some of the largest and best known corporations in the US – including Overstock, Expedia, DISH Network and most recently, PayPal – and expanded its services into Europe.  The manner in which the US government decides to regulate digital currencies will have a more significant impact on Coinbase, if it retains accounts from such mainstream corporations and continues on its current trajectory.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/13/former-senate-aide-joins-coinbase-as-us-government-liaison,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/756e83ba14816f398447a08f82fc836836f5b81c-1024x605.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42395300,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaH9z,1413201940,Market Weekly: Bitcoin Bulls Return in Wake of BearWhale Slaying,"Traders appear to have been reinvigorated by blood in the water this week in the aftermath of the slaying of the 'BearWhale' last Monday.  The bitcoin price was $327 at the start of last week and it was trading for $370 at the week's end, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  After weeks of tepid trading volumes, bitcoin exchanges showed a surge in orders, hitting 642,000 BTC on 9th October. This almost topped the 657,000 BTC in total trading volume at the height of the buying activity as the massive sell order of 26,000 coins was unloaded by the so-called BearWhale on the market on Sunday.  This makes the week one of the most active trading weeks in months. The last time this much trading activity was recorded on the exchanges was eight months ago, where peak trading volume was 711,000 BTC on 25th February.  The price then was $534, according to the CoinDesk BPI. It was on its way down from the heights of January, plunging from $850 at the start of the month to $563 by the time March rolled around. That was the start of relatively range-bound trading until another sharp drop at the end of March.  The rise of Bitfinex  It's no surprise that trading volumes have tapered sharply after Thursday's peak. Volumes dropped by 30% the day after this peak and have continued to decline over the week. Exchanges recorded only 147,000 BTC in trades yesterday, or about a third of where volume stood at the start of the week.  While the 'big three' Chinese exchanges continue to dominate the amount of trade in the BTC markets, with OKCoin leading the way and BTC China bringing up the rear, exchanges with less volume are still competing for commission fees.  One such rivalry – in trading volume terms, at least – is unfolding between Bitfinex and Bitstamp. The former is the Hong Kong-based exchange that provides a suite of tools for the sophisticated trader, including trading on margin. It has emerged as a strong contender with consistently healthy trading volumes.  While Bitstamp is often viewed as a benchmark exchange, trading volumes there have diminished over the months. Bitfinex, meanwhile, appears to be taking up the slack, as it continues to roll out new tools and products for active investors.  The gap in volume between Bitfinex and Bitstamp has widened this week. On 6th October, Bitstamp traded 69,542 coins on its platform while Bitfinex saw 55,925 coins traded. Yesterday, however, Bitfinex recorded 20,819 BTC worth of trades for the day to Bitstamp's 14,905 BTC.  The bulls are back  Market watchers continue to be bullish on the bitcoin price. The trading newsletter from BitMEX, a derivatives exchange in Hong Kong run by former Citi prop trader Arthur Hayes, recommends building a position around the $330-$350 price target in the near-term. As the price plummeted at the start of the week, Hayes urged newsletter subscribers:  ""Now is the time to take two hands and buy buy buy. I expect a sharp rally to $330-$350. The price will consolidate around those levels and build a base for a move higher into the year end.""  Long-only fund Pantera Capital, meanwhile, applies some cyclical analysis to the bitcoin price in its latest monthly newsletter (PDF). It finds that September 2014 marked the end of bitcoin's longest bear cycle, with the price declining 64% over a nine-month period.  More cheerily, Pantera observes that bitcoin bull cycles have historically returned a whopping minimum of 3.3 times the capital invested.  Martin Tillier, the NASDAQ's resident markets watcher who has taken a shine to bitcoin, puts the recent bitcoin price decline down to US dollar strength. Tillier maintains that bitcoin naysayers have it wrong, although he concedes bitcoin may well have been over-valued:  ""The point is that something losing value in terms of the US dollar over the last few months is, at least in part, due to general dollar strength.""  News and fundamentals  The last week has also seen some positive signs for wider bitcoin adoption. The US futures regulator was heard making the right noises about bitcoin regulation on Friday's panel discussion on cryptocurrencies in Washington, DC.  A Philippines congresswoman has introduced a bill for an 'e-peso' that could pave the way for greater digital currency adoption in that remittance-heavy country. The bill calls for e-peso to be made available at all domestic bank branches.

42377697,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX737d7,1413192273,New Bitcoin Wallet App Targets Philippines Remittance Market,"Philippines-based exchange Coins.ph today released a mobile bitcoin wallet app with features the company says are aimed squarely at emerging market use cases.  As well as standard wallet functions, the Android-only app allows users to buy and sell bitcoin through various channels, top up prepaid mobile phones, pay bills, and even work as a mobile remittance service by converting to Philippines pesos.  Coins.ph  CEO Ron Hose said the intent is to provide simple solutions starting from the most basic, giving everyone a safe and convenient way to use their money.  ""With our bitcoin wallet, customers enjoy similar perks to those they would get from having a bank account, minus the barriers for setting one up. Most importantly, keeping a Coins.ph wallet is free.""  Sending money home  The app's remittance features makes it useful not just for the islands' residents, but also for the millions of Filipinos living in other countries around the world.  Users can select an outlet from the app's long list of banks and payment processors, with useful notes advising how much each charges in fees. Some processors (generally the most expensive) will deliver cash door-to-door, others allow for customer pickup.  Customers can walk into any of over 5,000 retail locations to buy or sell their bitcoins.  To send money from overseas, it's possible to send bitcoins directly from an existing balance or perform a cash-to-cash remittance.  A user can initiate the remittance in-app and deposit cash in any bitcoin ATM around the world. The app provides a QR code for the ATM to scan, and pesos are delivered automatically to the preferred destination by the next business day.  Key market  The Philippines' remittance market is huge, with around $23bn-worth of incoming transfers to the country in 2013 and an additional $30-$60m sent domestically.  This has led to a focus on the country as a test bed for one of digital currency's most frequently-touted killer apps: the chance to side-step existing international transfer options.  At least three bitcoin startups are actively chasing the worldwide Filipino remittance market. As well as Coins.ph, competitors Rebit.ph and BuyBitcoin.ph are also adding features and building relationships with financial services businesses.  According to this TED presentation by economist Dilip Ratha, $413bn was sent in remittances worldwide in 2013 – about three times the total sent in foreign aid.  Banks optional  Unlike popular exchanges and apps in the developed world, Coins.ph users don't need to link their accounts to bank accounts to buy and sell bitcoin. This is particularly useful in a country where as much as 75% of the population remains 'unbanked' and fewer than 5% have credit cards.  High fees and long lines, Hose added, are the norm for those who can afford them least.  ""Traditional banking will never reach these people, because the costs of operating branches, armored trucks, etc. are just too high to economically serve a customer whose savings rate is very low,"" Hose said.  ""Digital currencies and mobile phones are cutting these costs down, and are going to change the landscape of financial inclusion globally.""  Expansion plans  Coins.ph says it is also developing a system for bill payments, allowing a family member in a country like Qatar or Canada to pay utility or tuition bills directly from the app or website for Philippines-based relatives.  The company has plans to expand throughout Southeast Asia, hoping to tap into the region's 620 million unbanked population. Earlier this year it opened a second exchange, Coins.co.th, in Thailand.  The mobile app, Android-only at present, is available for download from Coins.ph or the Google Play store.
