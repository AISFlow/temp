42421327,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqfN,1678489575,Who Failed Silicon Valley Bank Depositors?,"Well.  Yeah.  So, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) Friday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. Silicon Valley Bank was a $200 billion bank with over $170 billion in total deposits.  This is the biggest U.S. bank failure since Washington Mutual Bank in 2008 whose assets were eventually mostly sold to JPMorgan Chase after the FDIC took it over.  The FDIC said in its SVB press release that depositors will have full access to their insured funds by Monday morning – insured funds being the first $250,000 in a depositor's account. Everything in excess of that $250,000 will become available to customers as the bank’s assets are sold off to other banks and financial institutions.  If you’re thinking: “Hold on a second, SVB was a $200 billion bank. Surely it has relatively big companies as depositors who have more than $250,000 deposited with them,” then I applaud you because, yes, they do.  Of course they do.  There’s a lot to unpack here and the full story is far from even beginning, but going into the weekend there is one important thing we should think about and make abundantly clear.  Who is to blame here?  Read more: A Tale of 2 Banks: Why Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank Collapsed  I have fingers to point, so where should I point them?  Right off the bat, here’s who is not to blame: the depositors.  You will undoubtedly read suggestions that SVB failed because it was the bank of choice for VC-backed Silicon Valley technology businesses, many of which are questionably capitalized and horribly unprofitable (you know, the company that’s like “Uber for your Salesforce” or whatever).  Yes, SVB was tech-forward and, while not necessarily “crypto-friendly,” it did bank crypto hedge funds and VCs like Blockchain Capital, Castle Island Ventures, Dragonfly and Pantera (oh, and even CoinDesk). SVB didn’t fail because of any of these businesses. Even though it might make sense to be critical of depositor concentration in most cases, that doesn’t apply here.  If you’re inclined to point at VCs, maybe point at Peter Thiel-founded Founders Fund, which advised companies to “pull money from SVB amid concerns about its financial stability.”  In doing so, it managed to stoke fear among investors and sparked a good old-fashioned bank run, just as mean old Mr. Potter did to the Bailey Building and Loan in ""It’s a Wonderful Life.""  Sure, the SVB bank run only happened because depositors asked for their money back, but I’m hesitant to point at the depositors. After all, they didn’t have a passionate George Bailey (played by wholesome everyman Jimmy Stewart) imploring them to reconsider for the good of their fellow investors.  Of course, Founders Fund isn’t exactly Old Man Potter. It didn’t wake up and decide it wanted to tank SVB (and the idea that VCs intentionally tanked SVB to encourage the use of the fintech companies they own is a little far-fetched, even for me). Founders Fund was worried about something. What it was worried about was SVB’s failed capital raise, which somehow only happened in the last 36 hours or so.  SVB was running into some issues with its liquidity. If that means nothing to you, here’s the short: Customers deposit money into SVB, SVB takes that money and invests it in Treasurys, those Treasurys change in value depending on market conditions, the Treasurys SVB bought were long-dated so they were falling in value, the fall in value is precarious for the financial position of SVB.  (You can read a longer explanation of this from Bloomberg’s Matt Levine.)  From that crude explanation you should have one takeaway: SVB bought Treasurys that lost value as the U.S. Federal Reserve increased interest rates. That would normally be fine and dandy unless a bunch of depositors want their money back at the same time.  Which, as we laid out above, is what happened.  As you go into the weekend, know that smart people, or those who know jargon or read this column, will call SVB’s experience with the declining value of their Treasurys “duration risk.”  Point them at SVB and the Federal Reserve. Seriously.  If you’re hesitant to point fingers at depositors or the VCs that egged on the bank run, I don’t blame you. You could instead look at SVB and the Fed.  First and foremost, there was mismanagement of risk by SVB, which very clearly bought the wrong financial instruments with deposits. If it hadn’t, it wouldn’t have been raising capital.  But in defense of SVB (a very flimsy defense, to be sure) the Fed has raised interest rates by a multiple of almost 20 in the space of about a year. So while SVB made some bad bets, the responsibility for those bad bets should also sit with the Fed for raising interest rates so quickly.  How ironic: While trying to do something about high inflation, the Fed instead inadvertently started tanking banks that are invested heavily in Treasurys.  Lastly, and I will repeat this to make it as clear as possible, this is not crypto’s fault.  It’s not crypto’s fault because the collapse of SVB would have happened no matter what the bank’s depositor mix was. The risk management decisions SVB made with customer deposits were made without consideration for what the depositors were in the business of doing. It’s not crypto’s fault just like it’s not any other industry’s fault.  Except, of course, the banking industry’s.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/10/who-failed-silicon-valley-bank-depositors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eae24b041e87a21507aaed9da55964fbed4ec6e9-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Curve 3pool, a liquidity pool with over $510 million in USDC, DAI and USDT, is supposed to hold roughly equal balances of all three. But at press time the share of USDT had shrunk to less than 7% while USDC and DAI had ballooned to over 46% apiece.  The imbalance speaks to crypto investors’ sudden flight from assets linked to Circle’s USDC stablecoin; DAI is partially backed by USDC. Their fears are being stoked by speculation that a portion of Circle’s cash reserves – the assets backing USDC – may be locked up in collapsed Silicon Valley Bank.  Circle has previously said it holds a portion of its $43 billion reserves at Silicon Valley Bank. On Friday the tech lender’s deposits were seized by federal regulators after a run on the bank triggered its collapse. Silicon Valley Bank is the second-largest bank to go bust in U.S. history, and the first since the financial crisis of 2008.  “Curve pools have become a bellwether for investor sentiment regarding stablecoins,” said Andrew Thurman, head of research at data firm Nansen. “They also play a key structural part in maintaining on-chain pegs, and an imbalanced pool can exacerbate liquidity woes, adding to panics.”  By the numbers, 3pool has never before held such a small relative share of Tether’s USDT token as it does now, per a Dune Analytics dashboard created by Subin An, a data analyst for crypto fund Hashed.",NEGATIVE,USDT | DAI | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | USDT | DAI | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/10/defi-protocol-curves-500m-stablecoin-pool-hammered-as-traders-flee-usdc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/401d829d7e6a81928191cc784c8aac5f1228a1f0-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412698,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5osM,1678486102,How Silvergate’s Crypto Collapse Differed From Silicon Valley Bank’s: No Bailout,"For all the angst this week about how troubles in the crypto industry are fueling a banking crisis, the reality, so far, is actually something else: Of the two banks that went under this week, the one squarely focused on crypto – Silvergate Capital's (SI) Silvergate Bank – escaped the black mark of federal assistance.  It was Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which has a weaker tie to digital assets, whose rapid collapse required Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) receivership.  Similarities have been drawn between the collapses of the two California-based banks – namely that both were hit by a flood of withdrawals, forcing executives to liquidate securities held as reserves. Those multibillion-dollar sales forced the banks to take big write-downs because the values of the portfolios had been eroded by rising interest rates over the past year. (When rates rise – and they have massively, with the Federal Reserve hikes – bond prices usually drop.)  CoinDesk dug through Silvergate Bank’s filings with U.S. regulators from over the past couple of quarters to recreate executives’ fast-moving efforts to survive the fierce deposit run.  The exercise shows that, in hindsight, the bank did actually have enough liquidity on hand to satisfy depositors in full – and pay back loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.  In the end, Silvergate Bank didn’t survive. But its executives were able to avoid taking government assistance. Silvergate Capital’s share price is down 83% since March 1, the day the bank said it was unable to file its annual report. But with shareholders taking the hit – not depositors or the government – it was, in a way, the ideal scenario for a bank collapse, as strange as that sounds.  “The bank entered the liquidity wringer with ample capital,” said Karen Petrou, a managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics.  Read more: President Herbert Hoover Saves the Day for a Crypto Bank? Yeah, That’s Weird  Contrast the case study with that of Silicon Valley Bank, which so unnerved markets and investors that U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday convened leaders from the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and FDIC “to discuss developments around Silicon Valley Bank.”  “Yellen expressed full confidence in banking regulators to take appropriate actions in response and noted that the banking system remains resilient and regulators have effective tools to address this type of event,” according to a statement from the Treasury Department.  Blame Silvergate Bank for taking lots of risk on the crypto industry, and blame the crypto industry for taking lots of risk, generally speaking. Blame Silvergate’s supervisors for allowing Silvergate Bank to load up on crypto deposits and exposure to the nascent blockchain industry. But at least in this instance crypto can’t be blamed for draining the FDIC insurance fund.  Silvergate Capital representatives didn’t respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment for this report.  When it started  A glance at Silvergate Bank’s filings with bank regulators shows just how devastating the fourth quarter was, as crypto clients scrambled to redeem deposits in the wake of the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.  At the end of September, the bank had $13.3 billion of deposits, with about $1.9 billion of its assets in cash and $11.4 billion in investment securities, the filings show.  Over the next three months, deposits shrank to about $6.3 billion, forcing the bank to raise more cash by selling down its book of securities, to about $5.7 billion at the end of 2022.  “It was a classic bank run,” said Thomas Braziel, managing partner at 507 Capital.  One problem was the securities had fallen in value due to rising interest rates, so as the company liquidated them it realized big losses.  Partly as a result, the bank’s equity capital was cut roughly in half during the quarter, to about $571.8 million, the filings show. The damage appeared in a key gauge of bank health monitored by supervisors known as the “leverage ratio,” which fell to 5.1% at the end of the year from 10.5% just three months earlier.  That put Silvergate Bank right on the edge: According to filings with securities regulators, it needed a leverage ratio of at least 5.1% to be considered “well capitalized.”  Even so, that capital cushion would prove sufficient to absorb remaining losses as Silvergate Bank scrambled to meet depositors’ needs in its final months.  ‘Highly liquid’  Silvergate Capital CEO Alan Lane told investors on a conference call Jan. 17 that the company initially used wholesale funding to satisfy the outflows, but subsequently sold the debt securities “to accommodate sustained lower deposit levels and maintain our highly liquid balance sheet.”  Notably, as of year’s end, Silvergate Bank’s $4.5 billion of cash and remaining securities were set against $6.3 billion of deposits – putting executives in a position to, relatively easily, meet any further withdrawals as 2023 began.  At the time, Lane said he believed that Silvergate could “return to profitability in the second half of 2023.”  “We are committed to maintaining a highly liquid balance sheet with minimal credit exposure and a strong capital position, ensuring maximum flexibility for our customers,” Lane told the investors.  Read More: Scrutiny Falls on $43B USDC Stablecoin’s Cash Reserves at Failed Silicon Valley Bank  The regulatory filings show that Silvergate Bank, in its haste to raise cash, had obtained some $4.3 billion of advances in late 2022 from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco – a type of government-backed wholesale funding that’s available to banks but typically is seen as less preferable than cheaper deposit funding.  Lane said on the Jan. 17 call with investors that executives intended to reduce its reliance on wholesale funding.  “In general, banks like to have their core deposits in excess of their noncore funding,” he said.  As it would happen, that reliance on wholesale funding proved crucial. In a securities filing on March 1, Silvergate Capital disclosed that it had to accelerate sales of securities to raise money to repay advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, and it had to record additional losses.  Silvergate Bank “made a determination to repay all advances outstanding to FHLBank San Francisco in full,” according to a statement from the government sponsored enterprise, which was created to support community lending and investment. “All advances were at all times fully collateralized while they were outstanding.”  Silvergate Capital noted in its March 1 filing that the extra losses had pushed it below the “well capitalized” level and that it was “evaluating the impact that these subsequent events have on its ability to continue as a going concern.”  That last announcement appears to have sounded the death knell for Silvergate Capital; over the ensuing days, the company’s share price plummeted and major clients announced they were pulling their business. Speculation swirled that the bank might get taken over by the FDIC.  On March 8, Silvergate Capital announced it intended to “voluntarily liquidate the bank in an orderly manner” and that the plan included “full repayment of all deposits.”  It sure wasn’t pretty. But in the end, depositors were satisfied – with no FDIC intervention.

42412708,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5p0m,1678486071,"Ether a Security? That Could Have Huge Ramifications for Crypto, Legal Expert Says","If ether (ETH) is deemed a security by a state court it could prompt federal regulators to act against a major crypto asset, said Tonya Evans, a professor at Penn State University Dickinson Law.  On Thursday, New York State Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against KuCoin for allegedly violating securities laws in the state by offering tokens – including ether – that meet the definition of a security without registering with the Attorney General’s office.  One of those tokens listed in the lawsuit is the Ethereum blockchain's ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Seychelles-based KuCoin is the fourth-largest crypto exchange in the world, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Evans said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Friday that if the New York Attorney General prevails, defining ether as a security could have huge ramifications for the crypto world. Whether it is deemed one is likely to depend on what approach state and federal regulators take in defining the digital asset, but she said she doesn’t see how ether could be considered a security.  “I'm still unpacking that filing by Attorney General James, to really understand how a security is defined under state law. Obviously, it very much mimics the Howey Test from the [U.S.] Supreme Court case, of course, but oftentimes at the state level,” Evans said.  Once there are ""federal guidelines, rules, regulations and laws that may preempt state law, oftentimes you'll see things percolate up from the states and eventually make it before the [U.S. Supreme Court] to render the ultimate determination. And this is what we often see"" in new and emerging asset classes and industries, she said.  Nonetheless, the U.S. should be cautious about alienating the crypto industry and forcing it out of the country because it would be operating without U.S. regulatory oversight to protect investors, she said.  “If we're pushing this type of ecosystem offshore it will be more and more difficult for lawmakers and regulators to actually reach the point of keeping this ecosystem vibrant in the United States with clear and defined rules,” Evans said.

This week’s 11% weekly drop in bitcoin's price follows declines of 3% and 4% in the two prior weeks. Ether's price fell 11.4% versus 2% and 5% downturns in the same time period. The two assets’ year-to-date gains, once as high as 40%, have trimmed to 20% and 17%, respectively.  Both BTC and ETH activity spiked during Thursday’s sell-off because both traded in volumes that exceeded 150% of their 20-day moving averages. Other assets that saw volume spikes during downturns were XRP, MATIC, BNB and DOT.  Cryptocurrencies with a market cap of at least $1 billion were deeply in the red and none posted positive weekly returns. The one exception was utility token LEO’s 0.6% gain.  The year-to-date leader among assets above $1 billion in market capitalization is layer one blockchain Aptos’ APT token, which is up 196% year to date.

The week ahead could provide additional headwinds for markets. The U.S. government's act of moving bitcoin recovered from a dark web hack to new wallet addresses, including one owned by Coinbase, almost certainly foreshadows a sale that will likely affect the crypto's price and keep investors unsettled.

As the crypto-adjacent banks are shutting down, some in the crypto space have highlighted how a significant portion of USDC reserves are stuck in cash in Reserve Banks. Deloitte’s accountant report of Circle, published on March 2, indicated that Circle held cash with the following banks as of January 2023: Bank of New York Mellon; Citizens Trust Bank; Customers Bank; New York Community Bank, a division of Flagstar Bank, N.A.; Signature Bank; Silicon Valley Bank, and Silvergate Bank.  According to Circle’s transparency page, $43.1 billion USDC is in circulation, with $43.2 billion in reserves; $11.4 billion, or 26% of all USDC reserves, are held in the form of cash at Reserve Banks such as Silicon Valley and Silvergate.  Circle has since moved some of its USDC reserve deposits out of Silvergate and into other banking partners, as stated in a company update on March 4, but Circle hasn’t been the only one adjusting to the shutdowns of two members of the Federal Reserve System.  USDC is the token in the past 24 hours with the largest negative net flows from centralized exchanges among three parties: All smart money wallets, all funds and market makers, and all wallets, according to on-chain data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen.  Nansen considers a wallet to be “smart money” if it meets at least one of several criteria such as making more than $100,000 by being a liquidity provider/miner on Uniswap and making multiple profitable trades on a decentralized exchange (DEX) in a single transaction, through mechanisms called flash loans.  In the past 24 hours, all smart money wallets had an outflow of $68 million in USDC from centralized exchanges. Nansen-labeled funds and market maker addresses, which include Genesis Trading, Wintermute and Jump Trading, withdrew $79 million. All wallets had an overall outflow of roughly $902 million from centralized exchanges. (Genesis Trading, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.)  In the past seven days, $3 billion in USDC has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges as of press time.  Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto index platform Phuture, said in a private Telegram message to CoinDesk that “people are preparing for a worse case [sic] scenario,” noting that “people are moving into more trustless [stable] assets.”  Per Nansen, wallets with the highest balance of USDC belong to Binance, MakerDAO, Arbitrum, Polygon, Crypto.com, Voyager, Aave, Optimism, dYdX and Compound, demonstrating how large entities in the crypto space depend on USDC to hold value.

USDC’s banking partners included Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the California-based bank that was taken over by regulators and shut down on Friday.  The full list of banks that held cash for Circle’s USDC are Bank of New York Mellon, Citizens Trust Bank, Customers Bank, New York Community Bank (a division of Flagstar Bank, N.A.), Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank. Circle also keeps some part of USDC reserves in a dedicated BlackRock fund.

Signature Bank’s holding company’s (SI) shares have dropped 12% on the news about SVB’s shutdown. Signature said in December that it would reduce deposits tied to crypto firms by as much as $10 billion.

42411183,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLrmc,1678470002,A Tale of 2 Banks: Why Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank Collapsed,"It was the best of times … well, okay, my highfalutin analogy is already falling apart.  It’s just the worst of times.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This week has seen major trouble for financial institutions tied to innovative and forward-looking sectors of the economy. Silvergate Capital, a holding company for a bank that since 2016 had bet big on servicing the emerging crypto economy, announced Thursday that it will wind down bank operations. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which has long played a similar role managing money for venture capital-funded startups, was shut down by state regulators Friday.  In broad strokes, both banks were undone by the same challenge: classic bank runs. Their erstwhile customers, whether crypto exchanges or tech startups, are facing broad business challenges thanks, in part, to economic and financial conditions. That has led to declining deposits and rising cash withdrawals at a time when a lot of the banks’ long-dated non-cash holdings were also being battered by the markets.  That meant when cash demands got high enough, Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank had to sell those backing assets at substantial losses. Silvergate announced a $1 billion loss on the sale of assets in the fourth quarter of last year, while Silicon Valley Bank (with a larger overall balance sheet) also lost $1.8 billion while liquidating assets. In both cases, importantly, U.S. Treasury bonds made up large portions of the money-losing liquidations.  (This is a useful contrast with the inexcusably sloppy mischaracterizations of FTX’s collapse as a “bank run” by many major media organizations back in November. What happened at FTX has very little in common with the liquidity crises that have hit Silvergate and SVB.)  There are two upstream sources for these problems: Real business cycle issues, and Federal Reserve interest rate tightening. Those factors are also interrelated, and essentially go back to COVID-driven disruptions.  Fed rate hikes are the most immediate pressure that crushed Silvergate and SVB. I’ve been making a conventional warning in this space for going on a year: Rising yields on U.S. Treasurys would crowd out new investments in high-risk sectors including tech and crypto.  See also: Is Bitcoin an Inflation Hedge? Investors Are Still Unsure  But rising interest rates present another, seemingly widely overlooked threat to banks’ stability. As the Wall Street Journal explains in bracingly simple terms, the issuance of new Treasury bonds with higher yields has lowered the market value of pre-hike bonds with lower yields. Most banks hold large amounts of Treasurys as legally required collateral, meaning the same risk that hit Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank applies to some degree to a whole lot of banks. That’s one reason bank stocks, particularly regional or mid-sized banks, are tanking across the board this morning.  But Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank also faced specific business cycle issues that may not apply more broadly. Both catered to sectors – crypto and venture-funded tech firms, respectively – that saw huge runups in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both sectors benefited from COVID lockdowns, and crypto in particular benefited from the pandemic relief checks sent to Americans.  That means both banks saw massive inflows through 2020 and early 2021. Silicon Valley Bank’s balance sheet tripled between the end of 2019 and March 2021. Silvergate’s assets also grew massively in 2021.  Both banks would have bought more bonds as collateral to backstop that deposit growth – at a time when rates on those bonds were still around 1%. Rates on new bonds are now closer to 4% thanks to Fed rate hikes, driving down demand for the older bonds. That’s why, at the exact moment customers in bubbly or reversing sectors started drawing down their deposits, Silvergate and SVB had to cash in liquid assets at a loss.  It’s still a COVID economy  If you look at just one part of the picture you can probably cherry-pick reasons to blame this mess on whoever is most flattering to your personal biases. But it’s probably closer to the truth that everyone is simply escaping the same COVID-wrought shipwreck in the same leaky lifeboat, while fighting over who gets eaten first.  For example, some (particularly bitcoiners) will be tempted to blame the Fed for hiking rates, but that’s a genuinely necessary measure to rein in inflation. That inflation, in turn, was the result of both real cost rises linked to COVID-19, and a money supply significantly expanded by COVID relief and bailout policies. The net cost and benefit of those policies will take years to fully reckon with, but an anti-Fed critique at this moment is at best reductive.  On the other hand, it will be tempting for many in the mainstream to blame the cryptocurrency sector itself for the incipient banking crisis. The most obvious evidence for this claim is that Silvergate, “the crypto bank,” fell first. In the coming weeks you may hear it referred to as “the first domino to fall” or some such pablum, but that’s simply not the reality on the ground.  See also: 4 Potential Winners of the Silvergate Unwind | Opinion  Silvergate was indeed more fragile because it participated in a sector-wide degenerate long bet on crypto, one that was far ahead of the curve of actual adoption and sustainable revenue. But that’s not what caused its liquidity crisis, and its fall isn’t going to materially feed into any future bank failures.  Rather, every bank in America, whether they’re funding server farms or the literal corn and peas variety, is facing many of the same structural pressures. Their root cause is a massive real disruption in the economy – a virus that has killed more than six million people. If there’s one lesson to absorb right now, it’s that fiddling with financial levers can’t entirely smooth over that kind of real-world chaos.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,David Z.

42411196,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLsQI,1678467600,How U.S. Judges Might Save Crypto From the SEC,"If this year’s bruising battle between U.S. regulators and the crypto industry were a prize fight, we might judge the latest round as one in which the latter finally landed some meaningful blows even as the former maintained the upper hand.  By the week’s end, fallout from the liquidation of Silvergate Bank ensnared institutions such as Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank following government warnings about banks’ exposure to crypto. But it would be wrong to downplay the points crypto scored between Thursday last week and this past Tuesday, when the Securities and Exchange Commission suffered important setbacks in two separate court cases.  Given that it’s impossible for either fighter to fully knock the other out, the question is whether this round holds any signals as to who will ultimately be judged the winner when we reach the 15th round many months – or more likely years – hence.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Here I’ll go out on that all-too-familiar limb and say that if the U.S. continues to be a rule-of-law nation – some might say that’s a big assumption – then this week’s developments suggest that, when all is said and done, crypto will inevitably win.  Kool-Aid Casey, the critics will call me – the same people who think “crypto” is defined solely by the get-rich-quick, scam-filled culture embodied by Celsius Network, Terra, FTX and other high-profile failures of 2022 and not by the underlying technology with which they happened to be associated.  My confidence comes from two separate courtrooms in which judges, guided by an impartial legal framework, eschewed that popularist mode of judgment and instead considered the SEC’s claims against the facts and counter-arguments presented to them. That’s an environment in which crypto won’t be anthropomorphized by politicians and social media commentators but treated as the amoral, apolitical technology that it is, a tool that has both good and bad applications, neither a villain nor a hero.  ‘Might have an issue’  In the first case, Judge Michael Wiles of the Southern District Bankruptcy Court in New York said he was “absolutely shocked” by SEC lawyer William Uptegrove’s bid to block Binance’s acquisition of failed exchange Voyager on the vague grounds that the agency “might have an issue” with Voyager’s VGX token possibly being an unregistered security. Four days later, Wiles approved Binance’s deal.  Read more: U.S. Justice Dept. Appeals New York Judge’s Decision to Approve Voyager’s Sale to Binance.US  In the second case, one dealing with asset manager Grayscale’s challenge of the SEC’s rejection of its bitcoin exchange-traded fund application, an appeals court panel grilled the SEC’s lawyer over the Commission’s argument that spot market-based prices for a bitcoin ETF cannot be trusted whereas those underpinning SEC-approved futures-based bitcoin ETFs can be.  Many have long seen this as an inconsistent double-standard because futures prices are directly derivative of what’s happening in spot markets. So, when SEC senior counsel Emily Parise struggled to assuage the judges’ concerns, investors started buying the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a close-ended trust whose wide discount to the underlying price of bitcoin would likely close if it’s allowed to convert to an ETF. (Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  Separation-of-powers  Thank God one of the three branches of government seems to be upholding the separation-of-powers principle.  In the U.S, a dysfunctional, divided legislative branch repeatedly fails to reach the consensus needed to enact laws, especially in the divisive, little-understood area of crypto, which desperately needs new rules befitting its decentralized governance structure. That abdication of responsibility by Congress has created a vacuum in which executive-branch agencies such as the SEC are excessively empowered to practice regulation by enforcement.  The SEC has thus cultivated a Damocles Sword-like version of raw, discretionary power: it fosters the general expectation among crypto providers that it might one day choose to define their product as a security, but offers no clear guidelines on if and when the blade might drop. It’s the threat that’s empowering, not the action per se.  This capricious, arbitrary practice of regulation by a tripled-headed lawmaker-judge-and-executioner is effective with private-sector companies that cannot fight back – such as crypto exchange Kraken, which was forced to withdraw its staking-as-a-service product after the SEC deemed it an unregistered security. But it won’t fly in the courtrooms of judges like Michael Wiles. There, the judiciary branch continues to act as a check on unfettered executive power.  The long game  Of course, these are just two cases of a curtailed SEC, whereas the latest destruction of wealth, in which we’ve shifted from the initial FTX leverage-and-contagion story to one that exhibits the fingerprints of politics, offers evidence that the agency continues to wield great power.  There’s a direct line from the SEC’s campaigns against crypto protocols and entities, to the Federal Reserve’s generalized, unspecific warnings about banks’ exposure to “crypto,” to this week’s collapse of Silvergate and the panicked sell-off in the shares of Signature and Silicon Valley banks. Bank runs are always, to some degree, phenomena of mass psychology. Regulators practicing arbitrary enforcement are uniquely empowered to set them off.  Read more: Silicon Valley Bank Shuttered by State Regulators  But, as I said, I’m focused on the 15th round.  And there, in the long run, is where the United States’ decentralized system of government across state and federal jurisdictions is cause for hope. While the political stacking of the U.S. Supreme Court gives reasons to worry about judicial independence at the very highest level, the day-to-day practice of justice across this vast land is, by design, mostly free of capture by the executive branch.  That balance of power has existed for more than two centuries. It will last for a long while yet, notwithstanding the dystopian visions that permeate popular culture these days. And, over time, as it puts the law above politics and popular opinion, the judiciary will directly and indirectly force the other branches of government to reckon with unfinished business.  Crypto is, and will for some time, be a quintessential case of unfinished business. Protocols that are sufficiently decentralized won’t be shut down because they literally cannot be. So, in one shape or another, the industry will stick around. And eventually, battered, bruised and bloodied, it will gain the legislative clarity and legitimacy it needs.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,Michael J.

But backers of the exchange and yield generator are hoping to keep it alive via a merger with another team.  At least four decentralized finance (DeFi) projects are expected to submit acquisition proposals for mStable by the end of Friday, said the pseudonymous 0xloth, the protocol’s strategy lead. At press time, on-chain asset management service dHEDGE had submitted the first bid on mStable’s forum.  “We've been working for four weeks actively trying to pursue a M&A route,” 0xloth said.  A buyer would acquire mStable’s crypto assets, team and tech, including its smart contract-based vaults for generating yield on depositors’ stablecoins. Holders of mStable’s governance token MTA will ultimately get to vote on which proposal to accept.  MStable is a protocol for swapping and lending stablecoins on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains. Its yield generation service held over $11 million in crypto at press time, making it the 18th-largest DeFi outpost for Collateralized Debt Positions, per DeFiLlama.  The bidding process is the culmination of a month-long frenzy by key contributors to save mStable from an uncertain future. In early February, co-founder James Simpson announced on the project forums that he was quitting mStable after nearly four years on the job.  “The project will find it very difficult to raise with the current token given its value,” he said, referring to the MTA token, which at 2 cents is down 93% in a year. He continued: “The protocol isn’t earning enough from its products to self-sustain; and the [decentralized autonomous organization’s] runway is continuing to decrease each month and will be depleted at current burn within 12 or so months.”  In his post Simpson proposed three options:  Shutter mStable outright  Slim operations and hunker down until the next bull run  Pursue an acquisition from another DeFi project  “This could give MTA holders either a potential premium on the face value of Treasury Assets and a potential upside in case of a native token swap,” Simpson said in the post. He did not respond to a request for comment.  The only bid in at press time – dHEDEGE’s – does not appear to contain a token swap or other form of compensation for token holders. Instead, it proposes “to set a floor price” on MTA to the benefit of its owners.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | ZRX,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/10/defi-stablecoin-exchange-mstable-expects-4-buyout-bids-source,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5521e6a44973f7ea7ca07d5df5bdef37d077c3d4-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42415584,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JbvJ,1678467031,Silicon Valley Bank Shuttered by State Regulators,"Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was shuttered by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation on Friday, marking the second bank to shut down within days.  The DFPI said in a statement that it had taken possession of the bank, “citing inadequate liquidity and insolvency.” The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has taken receivership of the bank, DFPI said, which the FDIC confirmed.  “Silicon Valley Bank is a state-chartered commercial bank and member of the Federal Reserve System based in Santa Clara, with total assets of approximately $209 billion and total deposits of approximately $175.4 billion as of Dec. 31, 2022. Its deposits are federally insured by the FDIC subject to applicable limits,” DFPI said in its statement.  The bank’s closure follows fast on the heels of competitor Silvergate’s voluntary liquidation earlier this week. Holding company Silvergate Corp. (SI) said in its announcement earlier this week that all deposits would be repaid.  While not perceived as “crypto-friendly” as Silvergate, the tech-forward Silicon Valley Bank did count a number of crypto entities as clients – especially hedge funds and VC firms. According to CoinDesk research, Blockchain Capital, Castle Island Ventures, Dragonfly and Pantera all had relationships with the bank.  Among the bank shares moving lower on the news are fellow West Coast lenders First Republic Bank (FRC), now off 15%, and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), now down 25%. Crypto-friendly Signature Bank (SBNY) has also added to losses, the stock now off 13%.  The broader stock market has turned from modest gains to modest losse. The S&P 500 is now lower by 0.3%. Bitcoin is little changed at just above $20,000.  A SVB client in the U.K. told Reuters the bank's dashboard, which should show ""account balances and money transfers,"" was down.  SVB’s collapse with $211 billion in assets is among the largest in history, second only to Washington Mutual Bank’s failure during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008.  According to the FDIC press release Friday, “All insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning.”  Uninsured depositors will receive “an advance dividend” in the coming week, and may receive more as the FDIC sells off SVB’s assets.

In volatile action SBNY quickly bounced back from plunge to be down by 12% at press time.  Silvergate Corp. (SI) announced its crypto-friendly bank would voluntarily liquidate its assets on Wednesday, having delayed the filing of its annual 10-K report owing to questions from its auditors and accountants over its figures. Shares are up 5% Friday, but are lower by 98% on a year-over-year basis.  While Silvergate's demise may have rung alarm bells for investors about the durability of banks with close ties to the crypto industry, the rout has spread to more traditional lenders. Most notably, SVB Financial Group (SIVB), the holding company of Silicon Valley Bank, is down more than 40% on Friday and now off just shy of 80% for the week. The tech-friendly lender earlier this week announced a loss of around $1.8 billion on a securities portfolio valued at $21 billion, prompting a share sale to shore up its capital.  The broad SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund (KBE) – which counts banking giants Citigroup (C) and Bank of New York (BK) among its top 10 holdings – is down 4.3% Friday and 15% for the week. The country's four largest banks by assets (JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo) lost a combined $52.4 billion in value on Thursday.

10506846,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4586509-silvergate-bank-rise-and-fall?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1678463607,The Rise And Fall Of Silvergate Bank,"Summary Silvergate Bank's collapse was triggered by the collapse of FTX, which led to a devastating bank run on the bank. While regulators bear responsibility for not defining a proper framework for the cryptocurrency industry, the management also made mistakes. The failure of Silvergate Bank may have a significant impact on the future of the cryptocurrency industry in the US by removing the main on-ramps for the ecosystem. Silvergate Bank ( SI ) is done. It was a victim of the nature of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), it subsided to a bank run that I would argue wasn't completely their fault, but which they could have cushioned properly if they had less duration exposure on the asset side. But that should point to something that Caitlin Long (Custodia Bank) has been arguing for ages, that the nature of Bitcoin makes it inadvisable for banks accepting crypto deposits to lend money. It's not about solvency, it's about the fact that if you are illiquid, you are effectively insolvent . The Rise and Fall of the SEN Network Silvergate was originally a thrift and loan in San Diego County in the 80s but pivoted to pursue opportunities in residential lending after the subprime crisis. In 2014, they entered the crypto market by offering bank accounts to companies providing services in the Bitcoin space, which led to the creation of the SEN network. The network allows for seamless payment transfers between Silvergate customers and operates 24/7. The company grew their customer base during the crypto winter of 2018 and brought in-house software engineers to add more functionalities to the platform. The SEN network was a fee generator for Silvergate and provided a significant benefit to their clients, while also serving as an anchor for their zero-cost deposit base. The problem arose following the collapse of FTX (FTT-USD), Silvergate faced a significant decrease in digital asset deposits, leading to a restructuring of its balance sheet and prudent policies to withstand potential bank runs. The company took measures to ensure liquidity and accommodate deposit inflows and outflows. Silvergate adjusted its expenses, reviewed its product offerings and customer relationships, and implemented cost-saving measures like reducing its workforce by approximately 40%. Silvergate's management thought it had prudent policies to ensure the safety and accessibility of its deposits. The management team stated that it had structured its balance sheet to withstand a 70% drawdown on deposits and kept cash reserves that exceed all remaining deposits. However, at many levels, this wasn't enough, just like Caitlin Long had predicted it could happen to banks dealing in Bitcoin. Regulatory Scrutiny and Political Pressure on Silvergate I must say that amidst all the uproar and scathing comments towards the management team, it is crucial that we delve into the root causes of this downfall. Firstly, it all began with the collapse of FTX, which then triggered a devastating bank run on Silvergate, with clients withdrawing a staggering $8.1 billion from the bank . This, in turn, led to a colossal loss of $1 billion due to the bank having to sell off assets, including bonds, at a lower price than their marked value on the balance sheet, thus incurring significant losses and impairing capital. It's not like the bonds held were low on quality, if they were able to hold them to maturity, they would likely be fine. But, this happening in a rising interest rate scenario, made them sell before maturity and crystallizing losses. Nevertheless, the company tried to fight back with decisive actions to mitigate the losses and for a moment seemed to regain control of the situation. But then news surfaced of the Justice Department taking an interest in Silvergate and questioning FTX and Alameda transactions that took place on the SEN network. While it is unclear if Silvergate did anything wrong, having the Feds start poking around and asking questions is certainly a headache and distraction that a troubled bank didn't need. To make matters worse, political pressure on the bank has increased to deafening levels, which has destroyed what little reputation and confidence the bank had left. The pressure grew so intense that the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco demanded the repayment of the $4.3 billion loan that they had provided when the problems started. This loan recall is already stirring up controversy , with some questioning whether it was simply political pressure and cherry-picking rather than a neutral regulatory decision. The final nail in the coffin was the bank's delayed annual report , caused by the need to reevaluate the losses incurred and its ability to continue as a going concern. This led to its clients losing confidence in the bank and stopping the use of its SEN network, effectively killing it. Without its SEN network, the very reason for the bank's existence was mostly over. In a matter of days, the bank went from delaying the annual filing to liquidation. A Post-Mortem of Silvergate Bank While it is true that regulators, politicians, and the macro scenario contributed to the bank's woes, the management team had a role to play as well. First, they directed the bank's funding toward the cryptocurrency business. In hindsight, they could have diversified the sources of funding or been more conservative in the deployment of funds. While it is easy to second-guess their decisions now, we must remember that a big part of their job is to understand and manage risk. We can now say that they were overtly exposed to interest rate risk. On the asset side, they held bonds that went down with rising interest rates, and on the funding side, they had clients dealing in an asset class that was tremendously sensitive to interest rates. Their business was also highly sensitive to the rate cycle, making them vulnerable to market shifts. The most striking issue is that they were paying 0% on deposits and were even being paid to move funds. They could have just held T-bills and earned profits, which would have been less profitable but more secure. As I have pointed out, while the management team made mistakes, the regulators also bear some responsibility. The regulators have been slow and hesitant in defining a proper framework for the cryptocurrency industry, leaving banks like Silvergate in a difficult position. Most agencies seem more interested in extending their reach over to crypto than in understanding the nature of the asset and the proper way to conduct business. They try to adapt twenty-century rules to a twenty-first-century phenomenon, which is not always effective or appropriate. Therefore, it is not surprising that in some instances, litigation is yielding blows to regulators , as their lack of understanding and regulation has led to confusion and uncertainty in the market. In the end, there is some hope that deposits may be repaid in full , and perhaps even investors may receive some compensation. However, we must remember that a loss is still a loss, and it is unlikely that investors will recoup the full value of their investments. While the bank's failure may not be as catastrophic as some we have seen in the past, there is still a risk of contagion to regional and even big banks. This event may also leave scars on the industry, as common on-ramps such as Silvergate and Signature are now off the table. I believe the future of the cryptocurrency industry in the US is hanging by a thread.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4586509-silvergate-bank-rise-and-fall?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10506846.jpeg

42415583,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JbqY,1678462534,Reviewing Code Is Mind-Numbing: Q&A With Bitcoin Maintainer Andrew Chow,"Few people understand the key technical issues currently facing the world’s dominant cryptocurrency. Andrew Chow is one of them.  Chow is one of four “maintainers” for Bitcoin Core (or just Core), the most popular software for connecting to the Bitcoin network.  Maintainers review changes to Bitcoin Core known as “commits,” which are submitted – by fellow Bitcoin developers – as “pull requests” or “PRs.” Chow and other maintainers then approve or “merge” those changes into Core’s source code. The “code review” is critical to ensuring no buggy code gets merged.  The process is transparent, and as Chow combs through commits he livestreams the process on Twitch.  Chow is a gamer at heart, and only got into Bitcoin in high school to pay for video games he couldn’t otherwise afford. His parents wouldn’t give him a credit card, open a bank account for him or even give him an allowance. He resorted to freelancing on the BitcoinTalk forum and began writing code in exchange for bitcoin (BTC).  Chow, who says he's now in his mid-20s, gets paid as an engineer at the Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream, where aside from a few corporate tasks, his main priority is working on Bitcoin Core.  He says code review is one of the biggest challenges Bitcoin faces today. Most Core developers are keen on writing code for new features, but few enjoy the more mundane task of reviewing code submitted by their peers. Chow says more contributors need to focus on code review to tackle the 300-plus PRs in Core’s GitHub repository. The community has a Bitcoin Core PR Review Club that meets weekly to help newer contributors learn about the review process.  Chow agreed to an interview with CoinDesk at the Advancing Bitcoin conference in London. He elaborated on why code review is so critical, explained what Bitcoin Core contributors do every day, and weighed in on the current debate over op_vault and Speedy Trial. Here’s a partial transcript of that interview.  CoinDesk: How did you discover Bitcoin?  Andrew Chow: When I was younger, in high school, I didn't have a bank account because I was under 18. My parents didn't open one for me. I didn't have a credit card – even a supervised credit card – and I didn't have an allowance. But Steam was selling games for bitcoin. If you do PC gaming, you can download Steam and it has basically all the PC games.  Also, on purse.io, you could sell bitcoin for stuff. Well, I wanted to play games. I wanted to buy them. I mean, I'm okay with pirating but, you know, pirating things is kind of sketchy. You don't know what you're downloading. It could be complete malware.  So I was, like, this bitcoin thing is fully electronic. Maybe I can use that to buy games – but how do I get bitcoin? Maybe I can do some work and get paid in bitcoin.  I know a few people who did that. So that's how I learned programming. I’d go on BitcoinTalk and people would say, “I will pay you however much to write me a script that does this.”  Well, that seemed simple enough. I also had a friend in high school. He was, like, “Hey, have you heard about this bitcoin thing? I think you might like it.” He was definitely buying drugs with bitcoin.  So that's how I got into Bitcoin. And eventually I was like, “Well, I'm using this wallet and I'm running into these issues. I clearly know how to write a program. Maybe I can fix this wallet.” That's how I got into doing development.  I was running this thing called Armory. Which was basically not maintained. I mean, it's still kind of maintained by one guy, so barely.  By the time I was using it, it was kind of a mess and it didn't always work. I was finding that some of the problems that were happening in Armory were caused by things that Bitcoin Core was doing. So I started going into Bitcoin Core and asking what’s Bitcoin Core doing? Oh, Bitcoin Core has this bug that's causing us to have a bug.  Armory was doing something not recommended, which was to read the block files directly from Bitcoin Core – you're not supposed to do that. When they changed the format, it broke everything.  I was trying to reconcile the two, and then Armory just kind of fell off my map. That's how I transitioned to Bitcoin Core. I eventually stopped working on Armory because I got more done on Core.  Yesterday we talked about the ratio of Bitcoin contributors who review code versus contributors who write code. Can you share your thoughts on that?  Our main bottleneck in Bitcoin Core has been review. We have 300-plus PRs open and they need to be reviewed. Whether it’s just to make sure the code is good or just conceptually like, “Do we even want this change?”  The problem with every PR is that one person usually writes it, but we need multiple people to review it, give an approval or leave comments. Therefore, we must have more reviewers than people writing, but that's just not how it works.  Personally, I find code review to be a little bit boring. It's a little annoying and it can be kind of mind-numbing. But I still do it. I guess it's like a necessary evil and it's because I don't find it fun. If I do it enoug I start feeling like I’ll burn out because it's no longer enjoyable.  So you have to find some balance between writing code and reviewing code. It’s a bit of a catch-22. We have to have more reviewers than coders, but how do you become competent enough to review code if you're not writing code? It's a conundrum.  We're in a bear market and organizations like Brink that fund Bitcoin development are saying funding is down by about 50%. Why do we need to pay Bitcoin contributors and developers?  Fundamentally, every piece of software has bugs. There will always be bugs to find and bugs to fix. That's just general software maintenance that must happen.  And even then, the software that exists now cannot last forever. Operating systems will evolve and libraries will evolve and change. Eventually the software will just stop compiling on a computer; it might just stop running. And so, there needs to be constant work just to keep it up to date.  So there are always things to update, even without new features. But there are new features and we do want to improve Bitcoin. Not just the consensus rules, but also how we relay transactions, what kind of transactions we accept into the mempool and the peer-to-peer protocol.  There can be DoS vectors we want to fix or change that maybe haven't been discovered yet. There's always something.  If I'm a new Core contributor, what are some of the big issues I would need to know about?  There are currently a number of issues that exist, like pinning attacks, that are pretty well documented. It seems to be that no one exploits them, but that's not a good reason to not fix them.  There's been a lot of work on the mempool – how and what transactions are accepted into the mempool, what methods there are for fee bumping, and things like that. It's relevant to Lightning and other [layer 2] networks.  What’s a “pinning attack?”  If both of us open a Lightning channel together, I can make it so that you can never bump the fee on that transaction. So I can make it perpetually low-fee and it never gets mined, then try to double-spend it later.  There's a bunch of attacks you can do with the existing mempool policy rules. These are documented on the mailing list and they're definitely problems. If someone tried to exploit them it would be annoying, but I don't think we've seen anyone try to exploit them.  We still want to fix them and there's been a lot of work on making improvements so that we don't have these pinning attacks, or at least, if you want to pin a transaction, it'll be really expensive.  We also discussed op_vault and Speed Trial yesterday. There have been some tensions around James O’Beirne’s recommendation to deploy op_vault using Speedy Trial. Any comments?  With a new proposal like that, deployment should be the last thing to think about.  Some ideas on how to deploy things are, for some reason, contentious. If you want to have a discussion about the proposal, having deployment in there kind of causes it to be derailed.  So I do think James putting that in there was probably a mistake. The Taproot deployment section wasn't defined until after Taproot. The code changes themselves were merged into Bitcoin Core but not active. It's not unusual to just say we'll deal with deployment after we figure out what we want the code changes to be.  Speedy Trial was an experiment for Taproot. We've tried different deployment methods over the years with varying degrees of success.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/10/reviewing-code-is-mind-numbing-qa-with-bitcoin-maintainer-andrew-chow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42904b04e2e53cc36fe6638f389aca235f3b2a41-1441x811.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On-chain liquidations occur when the value of collateral added by a user borrowing an asset slumps, and the user is then required to add more margin to avoid the collateral being liquidated. Conversely, the user will also risk liquidation if the value of the borrowed asset rises beyond borrowing capacity.  CoinDesk reported on Thursday that $300 million in derivatives positions on centralized exchanges had been liquidated and that number has now increased to $400 million according to Coinglass.  On decentralized exchanges and lending protocols, meanwhile, a total of $119.3 million is at risk of liquidation if the price of ether slumps by another 20%.

First, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week suggested the U.S. central bank may need to get more aggressive in tightening monetary policy to fight stubbornly high inflation. Next, on Wednesday evening, crypto-lender Silvergate Bank collapsed.  While the Silvergate failure didn't arouse much concern outside of crypto circles, it was quickly followed by a crash in the stock price of SVB Financial (SIVB), the holding company of tech-friendly lender Silicon Valley Bank (down 60% on Thursday and down another 60% in premarket trading on Friday). The banking sector – as represented by the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) – tumbled 7.3% on Thursday.  The word ""contagion"" has now quickly re-entered the Wall Street lexicon, with investors wondering if it's not crypto or tech that's the issue but whether the past year's surge in interest rates has left the banking sector sitting on sizable losses in their bond portfolios.  Checking another key metric from February's payrolls report, average hourly earnings were higher by 0.2%, down from 0.4% in January and softer than forecasts for 0.3%. On a year-over-year basis, earnings were up 4.6% versus 4.4% in January.  Despite the rise in the unemployment rate, February's 311,000 job gain (and only a minor downward revision to the January report) is likely to keep the pressure on the Fed to continue hiking rates, which in turn could be a continued headwind for the banking sector and for bitcoin.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): 924 −8.9%  Bitcoin (BTC): $19,856 −8.2%  Ether (ETC): $1,392 −9.0%  S&P 500 futures: 3,916.25 −0.1%  FTSE 100: 7,751.62 −1.6%  Treasury Yield 10 Years: 3.92% −0.1  Top Stories  Investors sold stocks, especially shares of banks, and other risky assets ahead of the U.S. jobs report on Friday. Bitcoin has lost 9% over the last 24 hours, dropping below $20,000, a level the cryptocurrency hasn’t fallen below since mid-January. On Thursday, $250 million in long positions in bitcoin was liquidated, according to data from Coinglass. The wider crypto market also fell on Friday, after a week of interest-rate fears and the collapse of crypto-focused Silvergate Bank.  Crypto exchange Huobi has created a $100 million liquidity fund to protect against precipitous drops in its HT token, in response to the token suddenly falling 93% on Thursday. Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain and a large HT holder, confirmed a transfer of $100 million. The rapid drop and then rebound was caused by ""leveraged liquidation on the market caused by a few users,"" according to a tweet by Sun.  New York State Attorney General Letitia James sued KuCoin on Thursday, alleging the Seychelles-based crypto exchange is violating securities laws by offering tokens – including ether – that meet the definition of a security without registering with the attorney general’s office. The suit is the first time a regulator has claimed in court that ether is a security.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the momentum of most measures of the U.S. Consumer Price Index has weakened since August 2022.  The market has recently raised its forecast for the peak Federal Reserve rate to 6.5%. A continued loss of inflation momentum would test those hawkish expectations, bringing relief to risky assets.  The February CPI, which is scheduled to be released on Tuesday, is likely to show a 0.2% increase, translating into 6.2% annual growth.

42415582,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5Jbh2,1678449172,Replacing Silvergate’s Network Is a Challenge for Crypto Industry: JPMorgan,"The collapse of crypto bank Silvergate and the termination of the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) pose a challenge for the crypto industry, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Thursday.  Silvergate had operated as a gateway for more than 1,000 “institutional crypto market participants including major crypto exchanges, miners, stablecoin issuers, market makers and digital asset fund managers that have been using its network to transfer fiat currency between their Silvergate accounts and the accounts of other Silvergate customers,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  Replacing this instantaneous network for processing dollar deposits and withdrawals among crypto market participants will be challenging given the current backdrop and the “general unwillingness of traditional banks to engage with crypto companies following the FTX collapse and given high regulatory pressures,” JPMorgan said.  The report said it is inevitable that at least some of the payment and custody services provided by Silvergate will migrate to other banks such as Signature Bank (SBNY), Provident Bancorp (PVBC), Metropolitan Commercial Bank (MCB) and Customers Bancorp (CUBI).  Some customers that have left Silvergate have already announced they are migrating to Signature Bank. However, its capacity to replace Silvergate would likely be limited due to market and regulatory pressure to reduce crypto-related risks, the note said. Signature Bank has already said it plans to reduce its reliance on digital asset client deposits.  The entry of new depository institutions seems unlikely at present, due to the heightened regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrency risks, the note added.  This does not leave many options for institutional crypto investors in the U.S., especially smaller and less-established market participants, who may well seek banking services in Europe or elsewhere, the report added.

42415603,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5Jbln,1678447460,Silicon Valley Bank Rocks Crypto and Equity Markets Ahead of Jobs Report,"Risk aversion is in full swing, thanks to a crisis at Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), a pivotal lender to tech startups.  On Thursday, the self-described financial partner of the innovation economy sold off a $21 billion bond portfolio for a considerable loss to shore up its liquidity, sending shock waves across financial markets. The bank's issues reportedly stem from the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes and the resulting slide in bond prices and rise in yields. (The two move in the opposite direction.)  The market is worried that other lenders might also be facing problems similar to Silicon Valley's. That's evident from the sharp slide in U.S. banking stocks and their European peers. The KBW Nasdaq banking index fell over 7% on Thursday, registering its biggest single-day decline since 2020.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have each declined by 8% in the past 24 hours, reaching two-month lows. In the meantime, U.S. Treasurys have had safe-haven flows. The 10-year yield traded at 3.85% at press time, down 15 basis points from Thursday's high of 4%. The two-year yield has dropped to 4.83% from 5.07%.  ""Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), another crypto-friendly bank, comes under pressure. The bank is generally regarded as one of the default fallback options for industry participants impacted by the collapse of Silvergate. Operation Chokepoint 2.0 continues tightening its grip,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex, said in an email, referring to Silvergate Bank, a crypto bank that is closing down, and to a government crackdown in 2013 on banks that did business with the gun sellers.  This might be the first instance of bond yields falling along with stocks and cryptocurrencies since the Fed began its tightening cycle last year – a good old-fashioned risk aversion where investors seek safety under bonds. Perhaps investors are expecting the Fed to slow down its tightening cycle in the wake of stress in the banking system.  ""Pressure on the US banking system is questioning whether the Fed can push ahead with such an aggressive tightening cycle. This has seen US two-year Treasury yields drop 25bp over the last two days alone. This is dollar bearish,"" Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING, said in a market update. Weakness in the dollar usually bodes well for risky assets.  Data from fed-funds futures show the probability of the Fed raising rates by 50 basis points to the range of 5%-5.25% later this month has declined to 54% from 75% on Wednesday. The forecast for the terminal rate, the level where the tightening cycle is likely to end, has also declined to 5.5% from 5.65% reached early this week after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish testimony.  According to ING, systemic risk could wipe out bets for 50 basis point rate hikes, but nothing as of now suggests there is a widespread issue in the banking sector. So, yields and rate hike odds could rebound, adding to bearish pressures around risky assets in case the payrolls data blows past expectations.  According to Reuters, the U.S. jobs report for February will likely show a payrolls increase of 205,000 in January, marking a slowdown from January's blowout 517,000 figure. Wages are forecast to have increased 4.7% year-over-year in February, compared with January's 4.4%.

The attack occurred after Tender.fi upgraded its price feed to relay data from a Chainlink pricing oracle as opposed to a time-weighted average price (TWAP). Tender.fi's code, which was audited by PeckShield, contained an error and returned a number with too many zeros behind it. That meant the attacker was able to deposit one GMX token, worth around $70, effectively tricking the system into allowing infinite borrows, according to a postmortem published on Tender.fi's Medium page. There was no issue with the Chainlink oracle itself.  After extracting $1.6 million from the protocol, the hacker left an on-chain message: ""It looks like your oracle was misconfigured. Contact me to sort this out.""  Tender.fi reached out and agreed to pay the white hat hacker the bug bounty.  The protocol plans to deploy a new rewritten oracle contract before unpausing borrowing. It has also vowed to repay any unpaid debt left behind by the hacker.  The TND token, which plunged by 34% on Tuesday, was recently trading at $1.87. It has increased by 2.4% in the past 24-hours against its ethereum pair but remains down by 7.6% against its U.S. dollar pair following a crypto market rout.

Banks will still exist, but in the background as “custodians of old wealth.”  “New wealth creation and financial-services innovation will move to a new financial app universe on the Ethereum ecosystem,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  A revival of decentralized finance (DeFi) is in the works, one that is “far more sustainable, scalable, transparent and with improving token economics,” the report said. DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on a blockchain.  Bernstein estimates that by 2028, bank-free DeFi will have revenue of $40 billion and total assets will grow to $1 trillion from about $65 billion now. It forecasts $5 trillion in assets over the next decade due to rapid adoption.  The next generation of DeFi will be built on a layer 2 network that is scalable with 95% lower transaction costs and products that generate real revenue and sustainable yields rather than being driven by token incentives, the note said.  Layer 2 refers to separate blockchains built on top of layer 1 chains that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data. Layer 1 is the base layer or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain.

Per one observer, the selling pressure for ether came mainly from the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). The native token of Ethereum's blockchain fell to $1,392, the lowest since Jan. 12, amounting to a 24-hour decline of more than 8%, CoinDesk data show.  Data tracked by South Korea-based CryptoQuant shows ether's Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between ETH's dollar-denominated price on Coinbase and ETH's tether-denominated price on Binance, slipped to the lowest since Jan. 18.  ""Coinbase led the selling pressure,"" CryptoQuant tweeted, referring to the decline in the Coinbase premium.

42415570,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5Jaqh,1678426892,U.S. Justice Dept. Appeals New York Judge’s Decision to Approve Voyager’s Sale to Binance.US,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an appeal late Thursday evening challenging a bankruptcy court judge’s decision to allow Binance.US’ billion-dollar plan to acquire the assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital.  The appeal, which was filed by the U.S. Trustee’s Office – an arm of the DOJ responsible for overseeing bankruptcies – comes just one day after Judge Michael Wiles of the Southern District Court in New York approved the deal after a contentious, four-day-long marathon hearing.  Regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various state regulators, have been staunchly opposed to the proposed deal. Last month, the SEC filed an objection to the purchase of Voyager, arguing that Binance.US may be violating federal securities laws by operating an unregistered securities exchange in the U.S.  However, Judge Wiles appeared to be unmoved by the SEC’s concerns, telling the lawyers present at the hearing that the federal Bankruptcy Code “doesn’t contemplate an endless period of time.”  “Things have to be done. We have creditors who are waiting and who in the midst of all of this uncertainty have no access to property in which they’ve invested, in some cases, their life savings, so we have to take some kind of action,” Wiles said. “We have to do something.”  Under the proposed sale to Binance.US, Voyager’s customers would see an estimated 73% recovery. The plan, which was assembled after the crypto exchange FTX – Voyager’s previous top bidder – filed for bankruptcy protection in November, was supported by 97% of Voyager’s creditors.

Justin Sun, the Tron CEO who also runs the crypto exchange, confirmed a transfer of $100 million in USDC to Huobi just after 04:25 UTC, or 11:27 a.m. Hong Kong time.  The rapid drop and then rebound was caused by ""leveraged liquidation on the market caused by a few users,"" according to a tweet by Sun. This comes amid a broader crypto market correction as $307 million in positions across the market were liquidated as traders digest the impact of Silvergate Bank's exit from dealings with crypto companies.  “We will continue to improve the liquidity depth of main cryptocurrencies and HT token, strengthen leverage risk warnings and liquidity capabilities,” Sun tweeted.  Sun has previously disclosed that he's a major holder of HT.  HT dropped from a 24-hour high of $4.81 to a low of $0.31 at 21:00 UTC on Huobi’s exchange, according to data from TradingView.  In October, HT rallied nearly 75% as Sun said ""revitalizing Huobi is to empower HT"" and promised ""there will be many big moves around HT, including brand upgrade, heavy empowerment, and business cooperation.""  HT is currently trading at $3.90, according to CoinGecko.

42415588,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JcJ6,1678415171,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Plunges to Mid-January Levels,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin's fall below below $20K took the largest crypto by market cap to mid January levels.  Insights: Silvergate Bank's implosion and other events have shaken crypto markets, but investors of futures contracts still seem largely optimistic.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 950 −64.7 ▼ 6.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $20,067 −1669.2 ▼ 7.7% Ethereum (ETH) $1,428 −113.0 ▼ 7.3% S&P 500  3,918.32 −73.7 ▼ 1.8% Gold  $1,837 +7.2 ▲ 0.4% Nikkei 225  28,623.15 +179.0 ▲ 0.6% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin's Return to January Days  Bitcoin returned to January levels on Thursday, plunging below $20,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $20,067, down 7.7% over the past 24 hours as nervous investors stewed over ongoing inflationary pressure, fallout from the implosion of crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank and, most recently, a New York state lawsuit that alleges ether and other cryptos are securities. BTC has now erased about half its gains from a vibrant first six weeks of the year when hopeful investors sent the crypto up about 40% and past $25,000 in mid-February.  ""There's a lot of people that are scared that maybe the domino effect is just starting,"" Eddy Gifford, a wealth adviser for investment adviser Tactive. ""There's FTX, now Silvergate, who's next? We also had news out of the Fed where [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome] Powell was very hawkish on raising interest rates likely higher than anyone wanted to even expect – and potentially keeping those rates higher for longer. In those situations, risk assets in general tend to decline, because valuations are a function of the ability to meet estimates and interest rate environment.""  He added: ""So if the interest rate environment remains elevated for longer, that's going to push prices down.""  Ether roughly matched bitcoin's plunge to change hands at about $1,430, its lowest level since mid-January. Other major cryptocurrencies were firmly in the red with CRO, the token of exchange Crypto.com, off 7.6% and popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB both dropping more than 8%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the broader crypto market's performance, was down 7.5%.  The sour mood in crypto markets also manifested itself in crypto traders' some $307 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass data. Bitcoin (BTC) traders suffered the heaviest losses, some $112 million, while ether (ETH) liquidations surpassed $73 million. Of the liquidated trading positions, some $282 million were longs, betting on higher prices.  Meanwhile, equity markets stumbled amid a massive sell-off of bank stocks that sent JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America down more than 5% and 6%, respectively. The tech-focused Nasdaq tumbled 2.1%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. The downturn came even as jobless claims ticked up slightly, a mildly encouraging sign given the tight job market that has pressured prices upward.  Tactive's Gifford said that if bitcoin breaks with $20,000, ""we could get to $15,000 pretty fast,"" and if we break through $15,000 we go to $10,000 fast. But he noted bitcoin's staying power and halving next year. ""That typically has been a spark for bull markets in bitcoin,"" he said.  He added: ""We'll see a few more companies fall, but that's just going to make the ones that are left on the back end that much stronger. And I think that builds a case for we start actually seeing some more widespread adoption of digital assets in general.""

Funding rates are set by exchanges and regulate the price of futures contracts relative to the market value of the asset.  Positive funding rates indicate bullish sentiment, as holders of long positions are paying shorts. The opposite is the case when funding rates are negative.

And then it quickly rebounded.  The token dropped from a 24-hour high of $4.81 to a low of $0.31 at around 21:00 UTC on Huobi’s exchange, according to TradingView’s pricing source. Other exchanges saw a similar drop in price.  Just before the crash, $2 million worth of sales were reported in the five minutes leading up to it, a researcher at Kaiko tweeted. Normally, buys on the HT-USDT pair amount to about $600,000.  At press time, the token had rebounded and was trading at $3.70 on Huobi. It is down about 24% over the past 24 hours.  The wild price action was notable because HT is one of the larger cryptocurrencies, with a market capitalization of about $630 million (after the rebound). Crypto traders follow the token partly because Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, has disclosed that he’s a big holder – in addition to being a leader of the exchange’s strategy.  Sun, in a tweet, said the Huobi exchange's operations are safe, as are its wallets and backend.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization quickly regained some of its lost ground late Thursday (ET) and was recently hovering at about $20,040, down 7.7% over the past 24 hours.  After reaching a record high of over $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin tumbled late that year and all through 2022 to begin 2023 at around $16,600. A powerful rally into mid-February had bitcoin ahead more than 50% for the year at one point to $25,000.  Events since have given ample reasons for sellers to emerge. Among them was a stronger-than-expected inflation report that called into question the U.S. Federal Reserve's early 2023 assertion that a disinflation trend had begun. The central bank itself has acknowledged as much, with Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week telling Congress the Fed has far more work to do to bring inflation back to its 2% target.  In addition to interest rate fears, there was the collapse of crypto-friendly lender Silvergate Bank on Wednesday evening. Also on Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice moved 49,000 bitcoin seized from darknet marketplace Silk Road to new addresses, suggesting the government may have interest in soon selling that sizable stash.  ""Silvergate is one of several factors in bitcoin’s underside test,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""In addition to Silvergate, there is market concern of greater interest rate hikes by the [Federal Open Market Committee] and softening stock market prices. The [Securities and Exchange Commission] also shows increasing scrutiny of crypto. Taken together, the market has continued to tighten and retest support levels.""  DiPasquale added: ""As we have stated since January, we believe it will test its support under $20K before moving up again. We see $18K as the next major level of support.""
