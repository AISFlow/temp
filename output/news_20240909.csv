33398700,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640758,1725924614,"Crypto Research Firm Identifies Why The Bitcoin Price Could Crash To $45,000","10x Research, a digital asset research platform for traders and institutions, has unveiled a foreboding forecast for the price of Bitcoin (BTC). Highlighting current market conditions and Bitcoin’s recent price dynamics, the research firm projects a massive price crash to $45,000 soon. Bitcoin $45,000 Price Crash Incoming 10x Research has released a report outlining several market factors, which, when combined, paint a picture of a potential price decline to new lows for Bitcoin. While the broader crypto market undergoes a period of correction and volatility, 10x Research believes that Bitcoin could fall as low as $45,000 this cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Extended Consolidation Or A Break Below/Above? The reason for this prediction has been attributed to recent changes in Bitcoin’s active addresses. Markus Thielen, the Head of Research at 10x Research has laid out reasons for this pessimistic BTC prediction. Thielen mentioned that after Bitcoin addresses peaked in November 2023, they witnessed a sharp decline later in the First Quarter (Q1) of 2024. According to Messari’s reports, on November 20, 2023, Bitcoin’s active address account rose above 983,000, even reaching 1.2 million at some point. The network remained steady within this range until April. However, as of September 2, 2024, active addresses have plummeted drastically to 596,940. This drop in Bitcoin addresses indicated a reduction in network activity and a possible decrease in interest and demand among investors. Furthermore, Thielen disclosed that short term holders had begun selling their BTC in April, while long term holders took their profits, suggesting that the market had reached its cycle top. In addition to this, the price of Bitcoin fell from its all time high above $73,000 in March to its current level of $55,246, according to CoinMarketCap. This price decline aligns with the decrease in active addresses and the broader market volatility. 10x Research also reported that outflows in Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have contributed to BTC’s downward pressure and led to their pessimistic price projection. In the last eight days, Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a whopping $1.2 billion in outflows from the 11 listed US Bitcoin ETFs. This massive liquidation is currently the longest run of outflows since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024. Moreover, the current state of the United States (US) economy also paints a possible bearish picture for Bitcoin. The weak US economy and the ongoing futures liquidations are among the many factors that 10x Research believes could push the price of Bitcoin down to $45,000. BTC Faces Toughest Month In September In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Dan Tapiero, the founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of 10T Holdings, addressed the current challenges in the crypto market. Tapiero noted that September has historically been difficult for Bitcoin, often marked by poor performance or increased selling pressures. Related Reading: XRP Price To $100: Why Has It Not Hit This Price Yet? He disclosed that Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) have been stuck in a “painful consolidation” period since March. Despite Bitcoin’s underperformance this September, Tapiero remains confident that the market is gearing up for a major bullish trend, advising investors to HODL their assets.

33396166,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640839,1725919609,Bitcoin Support Retests Reflect September 2023 Patterns: Is Another Bull Run Coming?,"Bitcoin has faced significant price fluctuations marked by a notable crash on August 5 that saw its value dip to $49,000. This was followed by a rebound to approximately $65,000, only to experience another decline to around $52,000 last Friday. Despite these challenges, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is undergoing crucial support retests, reminiscent of the patterns observed in September 2023 before it soared to an all-time high of $73,700 in March. Bitcoin May Hit New All-Time Highs Crypto analyst Crypto Con highlighted this trend in a social media post, emphasizing Bitcoin’s spent output profit ratio (SOPR). According to Con, previous peaks have correlated with the 1.0 value line on the SOPR chart, where the cryptocurrency typically finds a bottom before entering a bull market phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Falling Wedge Pattern That Could Send Price To $3,000 This cyclical behavior has been consistent around specific months—October, August, and September—drawing parallels to the recession predictions that have emerged recently, much like in September 2023 and at the cycle bottom in November 2022 following crypto exchange FTX’s implosion. The current indicators suggest that Bitcoin may be on the verge of a significant price uptick, potentially surpassing its previous all-time highs. This bullish sentiment is bolstered by historical data that show Bitcoin’s propensity to break through past peaks, as seen in the chart above. Is September A ‘Fake-Breakdown Month’? In a more granular analysis of short-term price action, fellow analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin’s weekly close above $53,250 is crucial for maintaining the support level within the bargain-buying range of $52,000 to $55,000. This range forms beneath a downward-trending channel spotted by the analyst at $56,500 on Bitcoin’s weekly chart. Rekt emphasized that reclaiming $55,881 as support would be essential for Bitcoin to build momentum and attempt a recovery within the channel. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.15: Analyst Explains What Could Kick Off A Fresh Rally Furthermore, Rekt raised an interesting hypothesis about September potentially being a “fake-breakdown month.” Historical data indicate that September typically sees an average monthly return of -5%, while October averages 22.90%. This pattern suggests that any support that the Bitcoin price appears to have lost during the past month could be swiftly reclaimed, especially as the cryptocurrency currently trades around $56,600. Should October follow its historical trend, a 22.90% increase would position Bitcoin below its all-time high at approximately $68,780. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market records a 4% increase in the 24-hour time frame, resulting in its price regaining the $56,600 mark. However, over the last 30 days, BTC has recorded losses of over 7%.

Even so, the downtrend remains, and price action remains within a bearish breakout formation. This outlook follows the dump on September 7 that saw the world’s most valuable coin plunge, approaching the all-important round number, $50,000. Bitcoin Leveraged Positions Building Up Technically, the downtrend remains, especially if bulls can’t unwind the losses of September 7. From an effort-versus-result perspective, the trend set in motion by September 7 will shape the short-term, possibly accelerating the fall below August lows. Related Reading: FET Teeters At Trendline: Will A Breakout Fuel A Run To $1.86? Amid this development, one on-chain analyst notes that there has been a massive accumulation of leveraged positions from March 2024. Though it remains uncertain which direction prices will move, the current state of affairs means sellers have the upper hand. If bulls take over, this would be a massive sentiment boost for BTC bulls, who have had to contend with sharp losses over the past three months. Regardless of the direction, this build-up in leverage position precedes a period of heightened volatility in the coming days. While Bitcoin trends lower, sentiment has taken a hit, explaining the shrinking trading volume over the past two weeks. Since late August, BTC has fallen from around $66,000, losing nearly 20% by last week’s lows. At the same time, volatility is comparatively low and not unlike the state of affairs when BTC turned the corner, sharply expanding from late February before printing fresh all-time highs in mid-March 2024. Average Funding Rate Is Bullish, Will This Change? Interestingly, despite the lower lows, trading data shows that the average funding rate across derivatives exchanges has remained bullish for over a year. This development could be due to the shift in price action that saw the world’s most valuable coin turn the corner, rising from late Q3 2023. The recovery saw BTC shake off weakness and explode to above $70,000 after losses in 2022 that took the coin to as low as $15,800. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rainbow Chart Forecasts An End To Bearish Headwinds With $60,000+ Target For bulls to dominate in the derivatives market, prices must recover steadily. A break above $66,000 and July highs would likely spur demand, lifting the coin above the multi-month resistance at $72,000. Nonetheless, for this to happen, there must be inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Falling prices have accelerated outflows from this product, meaning institutions are playing safe.

42407700,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0xMe,1725916994,"Investors Lost Record High $5.6B to Crypto Scams in 2023, FBI Says","Investors lost a record $5.6 billion to crypto-related financial crime in 2023, up 45% from 2022, according to a new report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center.  According to the report published Monday, investment fraud was the most pervasive – and expensive – type of crypto-related fraud in 2023. Of the more than 69,000 reports of crypto-related crime the agency received last year, nearly half were reports of investment fraud, and investment fraudsters made off with a whopping $4 billion. And while crypto crimes only made up about 10% of the complaints the FBI received, the $5.6 billion figure was roughly half the overall loss by complainants.  Investment fraud schemes typically promise their victims the opportunity to make large returns with minimal risk, and have been on the rise in recent years. Last year, the most prominent type of crypto-related investment fraud was what the FBI described as “confidence-enabled” schemes. Sometimes called “pig butchering,” this type of investment fraud takes place over long periods of time as scammers form relationships with their victims, usually over messaging apps, before encouraging them to invest huge amounts of money in fraudulent cryptocurrency platforms that they are unable to withdraw from.  According to the FBI’s report, many victims of these pig butchering or investment scams have “accumulated massive debt to cover losses from these fraudulent investments.” While victims between the ages of 30-49 filed the most complaints related to investment scams, victims over the age of 60 reported the most losses – over $1.24 billion last year alone.  Though the IC3 takes complaints from U.S. citizens and foreigners alike, American investors accounted for 83% of all the crypto-related fraud reports it received last year, with California residents holding the top spot for both number of complaints (9,522) and amount of losses ($1.2 billion).  Human trafficking nexus  A 2022 investigation by ProPublica – subsequently replicated by the United Nations and others – found that many crypto investment scammers are human trafficking victims held by so-called pig butchering gangs across Southeast Asia and forced to carry out scamming operations.  The FBI’s report includes a warning to U.S. citizens traveling abroad about “the risk of false job advertisements linked to labor trafficking at scam compounds overseas.”  “These compounds hold workers against their will and use intimidation to force the workers to participate in scam operations. Criminal actors post false job advertisements on social media and online employment sites to target people, primarily in Asia,” the report said.  “Workers are often told they must pay for travel and other expenses, meaning the worker starts off in debt. They must then work off the debt while also trying to pay off their room and board. The criminal actors use the worker’s mounting debt and fear of local law enforcement as additional means to control them. Trafficked workers are sometimes sold and transferred between compounds, further adding to their debt,"" the report continued.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/09/investors-lost-record-high-56b-to-crypto-scams-in-2023-fbi-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7046683daa059fd52424f8e9fed007505ee50aa2-1275x717.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Even with the big bounce today, bitcoin remains lower by about 3% for September and down more than 20% since hitting a record high above $73,000 in March.  ""Unfortunately, potential upcoming near-term catalysts for bitcoin are sparse at the moment,"" wrote Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at NYDIG, in his weekly update. As has been pointed out by others, Cipolaro noted August and September have proven to be notoriously weak months for bitcoin prices. The good news, he reminds, is that October and the fourth quarter in general have tended to be good for price action.  The fourth quarter remains a few weeks off, and between now and then, said Cipolaro, bitcoin bulls might only be able to look to factors outside of crypto for positive catalysts. Among them would be macro news like employment, inflation and Federal Reserve policies. There's also the November presidential election, and while candidate Donald Trump has made very friendly overtures to crypto, far less is known about Kamala Harris' position.  ""We won’t guess as to which candidate might win the election, but November might be a pivotal moment for the industry,"" concluded Cipolaro. ""Until that time, however, bitcoin might be at the whims of the broader market backdrop.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/09/bitcoin-retakes-57k-but-potential-positive-catalysts-are-sparse-says-nydig,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa01b21678320afad11a06145177de3f5e728e03-7868x4422.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33393280,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640741,1725913805,Bitcoin To Break $100K By 2025? Experts Weigh In On Potential New ATH,"With its overall market valuation down about 30% from its March 2024 record of $2.89 trillion, the cryptocurrency market is reaching a turning point. Investors are worried as the market cap as of September 8, 2024, is $1.93 trillion. Nonetheless, a recent BTC price forecast indicates that Bitcoin is anticipated to rise by 83.70% in the next three months, indicating possible comeback. Related Reading: Helium (HNT) Network Expansion Fuels 13% Gains Despite Faltering Market Although Bitcoin has lost a quarter from its all-time high of $74,000, analysts like Alan Santana think a major comeback is just around the corner. The latest forecast of the BTC price by CoinCheckup, on the other hand, show that Bitcoin will surge 80% in the next three months and hence may also reflect its possible comeback. Now changing hands at $54,320, Bitcoin has shed 25% off its peak of $74,000, but it is due for a sharp rebound, Santana said. 🅱️When Will Bitcoin Hit $100,000? New ATH & More (The Greatest Cryptocurrency Analysis On Earth!) #Bitcoin Bitcoin is going to hit $100,000 in 2025… I am going to breakdown how everything will develop in a few minutes. How are you feeling in this beautiful Saturday/Sunday?… pic.twitter.com/xNaZSBOfKx — Alan Santana (@lamatrades1111) September 8, 2024 Santana thinks that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the year 2025. The ongoing correction does not deter the analyst from being so optimistic in regards to the long-term outlook for the top crypto. At the same time, he warns that this downtrend is not over yet, and investors should expect some turbulence before seeing a more sustained uptrend. Market Sentiment And Short-Term Outlook Bitcoin is currently 44% below its estimated value for next month, the latest forecast shows. However, a short-term uptrend is seen in the next seven days. Over three months, Bitcoin is predicted to shoot up by 83%, showing signs of recovery from its poor performance lately. Santana believes that though the price movement for Bitcoin will not be fast, it would stabilize the market after surviving fluctuations and swings. Bitcoin will advance relatively slowly across the remainder of 2024, and this would give altcoins room to start to outperform BTC in the interim. That said, altcoins might also supply larger returns for investors looking beyond Bitcoin’s gradual recovery once the market enters its accumulation phase late in the year. Other Coins To Surpass Bitcoin? Although Bitcoin could still remain the top crypto, some altcoins like Ethereum might shine in the not too distant future. It does have an upside, though, if certain market conditions move in its favor. This could open a window of opportunity for other cryptocurrencies that may perform better than Bitcoin as investors begin to diversify their portfolios. Related Reading: Ether Liquidity Plummets 40% On Exchanges After ETF Debut Long-Term Predictions: A Slow Climb To $100K Long term forecasts for Bitcoin would show ongoing acceleration of growth. Forecasts call for a 91% rise in six months, so early in March or April of 2025 Bitcoin might get to $100,000. This, according to Santana, is not an overnight jump but rather an upward trend due to improving market conditions and institutional interest. A new all-time high by late 2025 most likely falls between $150,000 and $220,000 depending on factors including inflation and market mood. Though the long-term projections are favorable, Santana urges caution about near future activity since volatility is still high and this current market slump has not yet fully run its course.

42390386,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1MP5,1725911961,"Five U.S. States Reach Settlement With GS Partners, Investors to Get Full Refunds","Five U.S. states have reached a settlement agreement with GS Partners – the European operation behind several crypto investment schemes, including tokenized investments in a Dubai skyscraper – that will see investors get 100% of their money back, according to a Monday announcement from the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB).  The exact size of the alleged scheme is unknown, but the operation itself claimed to have done $1 billion in sales as of last September, one month before a collection of state securities regulators, spearheaded by Texas, began investigating GS Partners’ owner Josip Heit and his companies. Starting in mid-November, regulators in 10 U.S. states – and one Canadian province – filed enforcement actions against Heit and his companies, alleging fraud and ordering them to immediately cease-and-desist selling securities.  GS Partners is a now-defunct multi-level marketing scheme that used a network of promoters and celebrity spokespeople, including former professional boxer Floyd Mayweather, to sell would-be investors a variety of crypto-related investments promising lucrative returns. These investments included plots of virtual land and a staking pool in the erstwhile “Lydian World” metaverse, a purportedly gold-backed crypto token, and vouchers allegedly representing tokenized shares of a skyscraper in Dubai.  Investors were allegedly told that the vouchers, each representing one square inch of the 36-floor tower – described a “glorious skyscraper…inspired by the winds of the desert, and radiates majesty as it shines under the burning sun” – would allow them to make passive income from the leasing of units. When GS Partners failed to reach their goal of $175 million in sales, the value of the vouchers plummeted to nearly zero.  As part of the settlement agreement Texas, Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas and Georgia have reached with Heit and his companies, all civil claims against GS Partners have been settled and investigations dropped and, in exchange, GS Partners will refund 100% of investments made by clients in settling states.  Joe Rotunda, enforcement director at the Texas State Securities Board, told CoinDesk that getting customers their money back was a priority for his agency.  “It is highly unusual to be able not just to provide material financial relief, but to provide 100% financial relief,” he said. “That's something that we, as state regulators, have always talked about – when these opportunities come up, we have to go for them.”  Regulators in settling states waived their ability to go after financial penalties payable to their agencies. Civil fines are a common outcome of many state and federal enforcement actions, but Rotunda said his agency’s priority was Texan investors.  “It's just a matter of priorities. Our priority was getting recovery for clients,” Rotunda said. “The idea of taking their assets and sending them to the state as a monetary penalty really just makes my stomach turn…So we were happy to waive the allegations of fraud if that meant the opportunity to get back 100% of client deposits.”  The settlement agreement does not preclude non-participating states or federal regulators from pursuing civil or criminal investigations into Heit and his companies.  In a press release issued by his lawyers at white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel on Monday, Heit said he welcomed the settlement, adding: “We are committed to refunding all eligible customers through the claims process. Our customers always come first. Protecting the brand, our reputation, and our customers is our top priority.”  Rotunda said he expects the claims process, administered by AlixPartners LP, to open up in October and run for 90 days. Heit and his companies will cover the cost of AlixPartners' fees as part of their settlement.  “In Texas, [even] if we really pushed for this case to be accelerated on the dockets in our legal system, we probably wouldn't even get to the point where we're presenting evidence in court by the time the clients would have received a return of assets,” Rotunda said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/09/five-us-states-reach-settlement-with-gs-partners-investors-to-get-full-refunds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70f6fb1df8813149e6438444829e648bbfc547e1-2011x1132.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The analyst also provided insights into when this meteoric rise will happen. When Dogecoin Will Rise To $3.7 The accompanying chart, which Trader Tardigrade shared in his analysis, showed that Dogecoin will rise to $3.7 in 2025 and could be the peak for the foremost meme coin in this market cycle. As part of his analysis, the crypto analyst explained why he was confident that a price pump was on the horizon for the foremost meme coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rainbow Chart Forecasts An End To Bearish Headwinds With $60,000+ Target Trader Tardigrade mentioned that Dogecoin consistently forms inverse Head and Shoulders in each cycle. He further noted that the mem coin is currently at the right shoulder in this cycle, meaning that the price rally that comes after the corrective move on the right shoulder is imminent. His accompanying chart showed how Dogecoin rose to its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.73 after this bullish pattern formed back then. It is worth mentioning that Trader Tardigrade isn’t the only crypto analyst who has predicted that Dogecoin could rise to as high as $3.7 in this bull run. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital (formerly OG Yomi) once predicted that Dogecoin could rise to as high as $3.80 and even surpass it. He explained that the foremost meme coin has never failed to meet or surpass the 1.618 Macro FIB extension measured from previous bull market highs to bear market lows. Kevin also recently provided a bullish analysis for Dogecoin, stating that the meme coin should reach its current ATH or close to it in December later this year. He explained that his prediction is based on the average time between previous ATHs and crypto cycles. He urged Dogecoin holders to stay positive as the market is still in a bullish trend even though it might take a while for the meme coin to recover. DOGE Could Lead The Next Market Rally Crypto analyst Ali Martinez raised the possibility of Dogecoin being the coin that first breaks out and kicks off the next leg up. The crypto analyst also gave a bullish analysis of the meme coin’s current price action. Martinez told market participants to watch out for a falling wedge on the daily chart as a sustained close above $.10 could spark a bullish run to $0.15. Related Reading: XRP Price To $100: Why Has It Not Hit This Price Yet? Kevin also highlighted this falling wedge pattern in a recent analysis, stating that Dogecoin was showing signs of being oversold on higher time frames and looking primed for a breakout soon. He remarked that Dogecoin’s setup is as bullish as it can be. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.09, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

With Shiba Inu (SHIB) seeing a 20% price surge and Mpeppe (MPEPE) aiming for a 150% pump in September, both coins are positioned for exciting growth in the coming weeks. Let’s dive into the details of what’s driving these price movements and why investors are watching closely. Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s Recent Surge and What’s Behind It Shiba Inu (SHIB), known as the “Dogecoin killer,” has experienced a remarkable 20% surge in price over the last few weeks. Several factors contribute to this upward momentum: – Shibarium Launch: The much-anticipated Shibarium, a layer-2 solution for Shiba Inu (SHIB), is aimed at improving scalability and reducing transaction fees. This development has bolstered investor confidence, fueling SHIB’s price growth. – Growing NFT and DeFi Ecosystem: ShibaSwap, the decentralized exchange (DEX) for SHIB, has been expanding its features, including NFT staking and liquidity pools, attracting more users to the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem. – Strong Community Support: As always, Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s community plays a key role in sustaining its bullish momentum. Social media campaigns and support from SHIB holders continue to drive demand. With these developments in mind, market analysts predict that if the momentum continues, Shiba Inu (SHIB) could see further growth, potentially adding another 20% to its value. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s September Pump: What to Expect While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has enjoyed consistent growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new meme coin focused on casino gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), is gearing up for an even larger price increase. With predictions pointing to a potential 150% pump in September, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly captured investor attention. Here’s why: – Casino Gaming and DeFi Integration: Mpeppe (MPEPE) merges two booming industries—casino gaming and DeFi—into one cohesive platform. With features like yield farming, liquidity mining, and NFT-based rewards, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is setting itself apart from traditional meme coins by offering real utility. – Growing User Base: As more users flock to the Mpeppe (MPEPE) platform for its gaming and DeFi features, the demand for the MPEPE token is skyrocketing, driving up the price. – Community and Marketing: Inspired by the success of Pepecoin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has built a strong community and continues to execute viral marketing campaigns, contributing to its rapid growth. With the token’s presale stage nearing completion, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised for a significant price surge as it gets listed on exchanges in September. Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s Long-Term Potential Despite Shiba Inu (SHIB) being a well-established meme coin, it continues to innovate. The upcoming Shibarium launch and the growing utility of ShibaSwap have positioned SHIB for further long-term success. Investors are optimistic that Shiba Inu (SHIB) will continue to benefit from the broader adoption of DeFi and NFTs. Furthermore, Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s commitment to its Metaverse and gaming projects ensures that it remains relevant in the evolving crypto landscape, providing solid reasons for continued bullish momentum. Looking Forward: September Price Predictions Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are expected to see significant gains in the coming weeks due to the innovative approach to combining meme culture with casino gaming. Analysts are closely monitoring these two projects as they evolve and attract new investors. With Shiba Inu (SHIB) aiming for a 20% price surge and Mpeppe (MPEPE) aiming for a 150% pump in September, now may be the perfect time to invest.

Two standout contenders are Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), both of which are capturing attention with their innovative approaches to blockchain, De-Fi, and meme culture. Let’s dive into why these two coins are becoming investors’ top picks during Ethereum’s recovery. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Sports, Blockchain, and Meme Culture Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another meme coin—it’s a cryptocurrency that combines the worlds of sports fandom and blockchain innovation. Drawing inspiration from Pepecoin and the electrifying talents of professional soccer player Mbappé, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has created a platform where global sports enthusiasts can unite through crypto and meme culture. Investors are particularly excited about Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential for wealth creation through its community-driven model, which fosters creativity and positive change. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Underdog With Major Growth Potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been one of the most popular meme coins, often dubbed the “Dogecoin killer.” Despite market volatility, SHIB continues to demonstrate resilience and remains a favorite among investors. With its large and loyal community, combined with new developments like ShibaSwap and future projects, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is still regarded as a long-term investment opportunity with high growth potential. As Ethereum rebounds, SHIB is expected to capitalize on the bullish sentiment in the crypto market. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Innovative Approach to Decentralized Finance (De-Fi) One of the standout features of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its integration with De-Fi protocols. By leveraging decentralized finance, Mpeppe (MPEPE) allows users to participate in yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance. This not only adds utility to the token but also provides additional incentives for long-term holders. In comparison, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has also dabbled in De-Fi through ShibaSwap, making both tokens strong competitors in the space. Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s Expanding Ecosystem: From ShibaSwap to NFTs As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to grow, its ecosystem has expanded with the launch of ShibaSwap, providing liquidity pools, staking, and rewards for token holders. Additionally, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has entered the NFT market, creating more utility for its token holders. This expanded ecosystem ensures that SHIB will continue to play a significant role in the future of decentralized applications, especially during Ethereum’s recovery. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Focus on Community Wealth Creation What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from many meme coins is its strong focus on community wealth creation. Through strategic planning and community involvement, Mpeppe (MPEPE) aims to foster global sports enthusiasts while driving real-world impact. As more investors seek opportunities that combine financial rewards with community empowerment, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is increasingly seen as an ideal investment. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Are the Go-To Investments for Ethereum’s Recovery As Ethereum gears up for a potential recovery, both Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have positioned themselves as strong investments. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s blend of sports fandom, blockchain innovation, and De-Fi makes it an attractive option for those seeking high returns. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s ever-growing ecosystem and dedicated community continue to drive its popularity. Investors looking for growth and diversification in the meme coin space should keep a close eye on both Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).

42390389,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1MZL,1725905662,Kalshi's U.S. Election Markets Delayed Until Friday at Earliest,"Kalshi may be basking in the glory of a court victory over regulators, but it will have to wait at least until Friday to list its long-sought prediction markets on the upcoming U.S. election.  On Monday afternoon, Judge Jia Cobb of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia called for a Thursday hearing. In the meantime, she stayed her Friday order clearing the way for Kalshi to list event contracts on which party will control each house of Congress after the election.  Last year, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission barred Kalshi from listing such contracts. Among other reasons, the regulator said it was concerned about potential damage to the integrity of elections if traders were allowed to bet as much as $100 million on them. Kalshi then sued.  In her Friday ruling, Judge Cobb sided with Kalshi but did not give her rationale, which she said she would spell out in a subsequent opinion. She still has not said when that opinion would be published.  Hours after its defeat, the CFTC filed its emergency motion asking Cobb to stay her order for 14 days following publication of the opinion. Without knowing her reasoning, the agency said, it can't determine whether it should appeal the decision.  If granted, the stay proposed by the CFTC would prevent Kalshi from listing election markets until late September at the earliest, giving it only five weeks or so to partake in this year's election betting boom. The company has been locked out of the action while the case was pending.  However, the stay Judge Cobb ordered Monday will last only until the end of Thursday's hearing, meaning that depending on what happens, Kalshi might still be able to list the markets as soon as Friday.  Kalshi is the only CFTC-regulated prediction market in the U.S., the only country where the company has users. It lists contracts on a variety of events, ranging from whether U.S. students' test scores will improve or worsen to how high bitcoin will rise this year. (To be clear: Trades are settled in dollars.)  PredictIt, an older U.S.-only site that also settles bets in fiat, lists election contracts under a narrow regulatory exemption. Polymarket, this year's breakout success story in both prediction markets and cryptocurrency, is barred from doing business with U.S. residents under a settlement with the CFTC.  Nevertheless, both companies have gained market share at Kalshi's expense, the company complained in a weekend filing pushing back against the CFTC's proposed delay.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/09/kalshis-us-election-markets-delayed-until-friday-at-earliest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2afe9db76cbc4e08734a9d2f901f2475f655c09f-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33388920,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640831,1725905114,Crypto Analyst Dive Into Why Dogecoin (DOGE) Can Not Fight Off Mpeppe (MPEPE) For Long Term Investment Growth,"As meme coins continue to dominate the cryptocurrency market, the battle between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) for long-term investment growth has captured the attention of analysts. While Dogecoin (DOGE) has established itself as a frontrunner in the meme coin space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making significant strides with its innovative integration of decentralized finance (De-Fi) and online gambling, positioning it as a strong contender for future growth. Here’s why Mpeppe (MPEPE) might outshine Dogecoin (DOGE) for long-term investments. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Yield Farming Integration Is A Game Changer One of the key factors driving Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s growth potential is its ability to integrate De-Fi protocols within its ecosystem. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), which mainly relies on market speculation and transactions, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers yield farming opportunities. This allows users to earn returns by staking their crypto assets, making it not only a meme coin but also a token that generates passive income. With the added functionality of online gambling, investors can stake their Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens on decentralized platforms while participating in various gambling activities, further increasing the token’s utility and long-term growth potential. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s Lack of Utility Hinders Long-Term Growth While Dogecoin (DOGE) has gained massive popularity, its primary use case remains limited to transactions and tipping. Unlike Mpeppe (MPEPE), which offers a range of decentralized finance and gaming utilities, Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks innovative features that can drive sustained growth. Mpeppe (MPEPE) brings real-world utility through its online gambling platform and De-Fi integration, positioning itself as a more versatile and long-term investment opportunity. The ability to earn rewards through yield farming and participate in online gambling adds layers of value that Dogecoin (DOGE) currently cannot match. Tokenized Rewards Enhance Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Appeal Another advantage Mpeppe (MPEPE) holds over Dogecoin (DOGE) is its tokenized rewards system. By participating in online gambling platforms, players can receive in-game tokens that can be utilized in the broader De-Fi ecosystem. These tokens can be used for liquidity provision, lending, or trading, creating a seamless integration between the gaming and financial sectors. This not only enhances the utility of Mpeppe (MPEPE) but also creates new revenue streams for users. Dogecoin (DOGE), by contrast, has not introduced such innovative features, making Mpeppe (MPEPE) a more appealing long-term option for investors seeking both entertainment and financial returns. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Future Looks Bright for Long-Term Investors While Dogecoin (DOGE) has established itself as a dominant meme coin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as a formidable competitor with its innovative De-Fi and online gambling features. By offering yield farming, tokenized rewards, and NFT integration, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is setting itself apart as a long-term investment that goes beyond speculation and offers real-world utility. For investors looking for sustainable growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as the superior option in the meme coin space, offering both excitement and long-term financial rewards.

33388759,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640829,1725904815,Dogecoin (DOGE) Vs Mpeppe (MPEPE): Experts Explain Which Coin Will Have Exspolsive Gains After Marker Recovery,"The meme coin battle between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) has intensified as investors look to capitalize on explosive gains after the market recovery. While Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the leader in the meme coin world, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining traction with its innovative approach to decentralized casino gaming. Let’s explore what experts are saying about the potential of each coin and which one could deliver the most significant gains. The Power of Decentralization: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Edge Over Dogecoin (DOGE) One of the standout features of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its integration of decentralized ledgers. This innovation removes the need for intermediaries, providing a seamless gambling experience for users. In contrast, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains primarily a speculative investment with little utility beyond its meme coin status. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s casino ecosystem offers real-world applications, which could propel it past DOGE after the market rebounds. A Game-Changer for Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Casino Mpeppe (MPEPE) utilizes immutable blockchain technology, ensuring the integrity and security of all financial transactions within its platform. This feature is crucial for the online casino world, where protecting player data and funds is paramount. Dogecoin (DOGE), while popular, lacks this specialized functionality, making Mpeppe (MPEPE) more attractive to long-term investors looking for practical use cases in addition to speculative gains. Revolutionizing Casino Gameplay with Mpeppe (MPEPE) The integration of smart contracts within the Mpeppe (MPEPE) ecosystem introduces a revolutionary gameplay experience. Smart contracts ensure the transparent and fair execution of gaming agreements, giving players peace of mind while engaging in online gambling. Dogecoin (DOGE) does not have a similar system in place, limiting its potential to capitalize on the growing gaming sector. As the market recovers, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s ability to leverage smart contracts could drive its explosive growth. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s Legacy: Can It Keep Up with Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Innovations? Dogecoin (DOGE) has earned its place as a beloved meme coin, largely due to its strong community support and the occasional tweets from figures like Elon Musk. However, its lack of tangible use cases may hinder its ability to see sustained gains in the future. In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is building an ecosystem that appeals to both investors and gamers, giving it a competitive edge in the post-recovery market. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Advantage A key factor driving Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s popularity is its ability to facilitate global access to online gambling platforms. The decentralized nature of Mpeppe (MPEPE) ensures that players from around the world can participate without the hassle of currency conversion or geographical restrictions. Additionally, low transaction costs make it more appealing to users compared to traditional banking methods. Dogecoin (DOGE), while fast and efficient for transactions, does not have the same casino-focused infrastructure. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Utility Could Outpace Dogecoin (DOGE)’s Meme Power As the market recovers, experts agree that Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s ability to offer decentralization, security, and low transaction costs in the casino industry sets it apart from Dogecoin (DOGE). While DOGE continues to thrive on its meme culture, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s unique utility and innovative integration of DeFi could lead to more explosive gains in the long run. Both coins offer opportunities, but Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming a standout in the meme coin world with real-world applications that Dogecoin (DOGE) currently lacks.

Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme-inspired cryptocurrency with strong ties to the casino and gaming sector, is becoming a favored option for those looking to capitalize on both speculative gains and the growing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi). Helium (HNT) Nears $9 Amidst Strong Network Growth Helium (HNT) continues to surge as its decentralized IoT network grows. With an increasing number of hotspots around the globe, Helium (HNT) is set to play a critical role in the future of wireless communication. As the token inches closer to the $9 mark, investors are seeing significant returns and looking for new ways to diversify their holdings.

The success of Mpeppe (MPEPE) has drawn the attention of Helium (HNT) investors eager to maximize their profits by exploring this innovative casino coin. Cryptocurrencies and Online Casinos: A Perfect Match The rise of cryptocurrencies in online casinos has been fueled by several key factors. Cryptocurrencies offer enhanced security and privacy, making them ideal for use in gambling platforms. Additionally, the transparency provided by blockchain technology ensures that transactions are both trackable and secure, building trust between users and platforms. Overcoming Geographical Barriers with Crypto One of the standout benefits of using cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE) in online casinos is the global accessibility they provide. Players from around the world can participate without the need for currency conversions or dealing with traditional banking restrictions. This accessibility is one of the driving factors behind Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s increasing adoption in the online gambling space. Low Transaction Costs Make Mpeppe (MPEPE) Even More Attractive In addition to accessibility, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out due to its low transaction costs. Traditional payment methods often involve high fees and long processing times, but blockchain technology enables fast, cost-efficient transactions. This further enhances Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal for those engaging in online gaming and betting. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Future: What’s Next for the Casino Coin? As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain traction, the future looks bright. With plans to expand its platform and further integrate DeFi elements, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is set to capture even more market share in the online gambling industry. For those looking to ride the wave of this rising star, now may be the perfect time to get involved. Final Thoughts: Helium (HNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Leading the Charge Both Helium (HNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are thriving in their respective markets. Helium (HNT) is pushing boundaries in the IoT space, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) is revolutionizing the online casino world through its DeFi integration. Together, these two cryptocurrencies offer compelling opportunities for investors looking to diversify and maximize their returns.

42390381,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1M4Z,1725904502,GenZ’s Toolkit for a New Bangladesh: Blockchain,"We all remember where we were “when it happened”: I was in a dark cabin, waking up on a flight from Los Angeles to Dhaka to reunite with my family. A fellow Bangladeshi sat nearby, and our phones were abuzz with notifications. We exchanged wide-eyed glances, not yet daring to believe the magnitude of what had just happened in our homeland.  A little over a month ago on August 5, Bangladesh’s GenZ achieved the unimaginable: toppling one of the world's most corrupt governments in a matter of weeks, in spite of a cocktail of repressive tactics including the use of lethal force, internet shutdowns, and curfews.  Sharmeen Shehabuddin is Social Media Lead at Consensys. The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the company.  Fun fact: Bangladesh has three de facto national pastimes (the 3Cs if you will): cricket, cha (tea), and, regrettably, corruption. While the first two inspire pride, the third has turned governance into a tragic farce. What is now known as the “Monsoon Revolution,” in which hundreds of lives were lost and tens of thousands injured, was not just another episode in Bangladesh’s history. It was a collective reckoning.  The abrupt end of 16 years of single-party rule has triggered widespread hope that Bangladesh will finally wrest itself from the clutches of corruption. Yet, the question remains: How do we ensure that corruption does not simply reemerge in a plethora of other forms? The answer lies in practical, enforceable tools like blockchain.  Caveat, of course: No technology, however advanced, can substitute for the moral compass of human conscience and empathy. A tool is only as good as its handler.  I am, along with millions of other Bangladeshis, defiantly optimistic as we inch toward a truly shadhin (independent) Bangladesh, where transparency and accountability aren’t just lofty ideals but the solid foundation we stand on. Rooting out the deeply entrenched corruption that has suffocated our institutions for over 50 years won't be easy. But we have the tools to build the future we owe to the young lives lost at the hands of those meant to protect them.  A growing Bangladeshi community of Web3 builders stands ready to bring decentralization and transparency to our public goods. Peer-to-peer messaging apps, like Briar, kept the Monsoon Revolution's organizers connected via Bluetooth when the government cut off the internet for days to silence protests. This reckless attempt by the government to stifle dissent not only further underscored the nation’s resolve for drastic change, but also its readiness for decentralized technology.  We’ve just been hit with our most catastrophic flood in 30 years. Natural disasters hit us hard and often; the aftermath is almost always marked by suffering and mismanagement. In Bangladesh, foreign aid often has a notorious tendency to vanish before it reaches those who need it most.  Fortunately, a glimmer of hope shines through the World Food Programme's Building Blockssystem, which offers a model for efficiently and fairly distributing food aid to its intended recipients. Building Blocks has already made a meaningful difference here in Bangladesh with the Rohingya refugee crisis, as well as in Jordan, Kenya, and other countries. We can do more.  Our electoral process is a nightmare, where elections are called before voters even make it to the polls, with the 2014 and 2018 elections standing as grim reminders. But then we had Sierra Leone, quietly trialing a voting system using Kiva Protocol in 2018, and Thailand, where over 120,000 voters in the Democrat Party’s 2018 primary elections used the Zcoin blockchain . Every vote, recorded on an immutable ledger. No more tricks; no more deceit. If Bangladesh embraces such a system, it’s wonderful to fathom the trust we could restore in elections.  Bangladeshi land disputes are the stuff of legend. Slum evictions, the never-ending land acquisition sagas, families killing each other - all tales of woe. Meanwhile, there's a practical model for us to draw inspiration from right next door. In 2024, the Indian state of Assam launched a blockchain-based pilot project for land registry, building on existing digital systems like ULPIN (Unique Land Parcel Identification Number). There have been compelling proposals for a blockchain-based land registry in Bangladesh over the years, unfortunately with no follow-through.  The garment industry, the backbone of Bangladesh’s economy, has long been plagued by poor working conditions and wage delays. Meanwhile, countries like Vietnam and Cambodia have used blockchain for years to ensure transparency in supply chains, guaranteeing fair wages and safe conditions for workers. In Colombia, blockchain networks help indigenous coffee farmers secure, timely, and fair payments. We can and should adopt these practices and finally give our workers and farmers the respect and compensation they deserve.  These examples demonstrate that blockchain technologies aren’t some far-off use-cases with no relevance to Bangladesh; they’re here, they’re real, and they’re addressing the very challenges we face. While blockchain has been adopted by services like bKash, adopting these technologies for public service can enable Bangladesh to finally build a government that’s transparent, accountable, and efficient. There are several proposals floating around about the revolutionary potential of blockchain adoption in Bangladesh. What we desperately need now is a focused strategy and implementation.  With Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Muhammad Yunus heading our nonpartisan interim government, Bangladesh is looking at a world of possibilities and the Professor is a man of indefatigable energy. Having worked for him as a writer years ago, I can attest to his endurance, a pace so intense that I eventually burned out and started a bakery just to recover.  We can finally serve the people of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, not just the interests of a select few. This isn’t simply about eliminating corruption; it’s about restoring public trust in our institutions, trust we owe to those brave young students who gave their lives this summer for a fair and just society.  And so, here I am, just a girl who tweets and makes memes for a living, standing in front of a newly formed interim government, asking it to adopt blockchain in its public goods. The old guard will resist, as politicians do, just for the sake of it. But Bangladesh has endured too much to retreat into the shadows of its past. The global Web3 community should be here to help. We can never forget that the true strength of any system lies in the people who uphold it, not just the technology that powers it.  As Rabindranath Tagore, our subcontinental treasure who penned the national anthems for both India and Bangladesh, wrote, ""Let my country awake.""

33387912,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640648,1725903028,Dogecoin To $0.15: Analyst Explains What Could Kick Off A Fresh Rally,"An analyst has explained how Dogecoin has been forming a Falling Wedge pattern recently, breaking which may kickstart a new bull rally. Dogecoin Has Been Moving Inside A Falling Wedge Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed a pattern that has recently been forming in the 1-day price of Dogecoin. The pattern in question is the “Falling Wedge” from technical analysis (TA), which is a type of Wedge. A Wedge pattern appears when the price of the asset consolidates between two converging trendlines (that is, the lines have different slopes and are angled inwards). Depending on where this consolidation is headed, the pattern is termed as Falling or Rising. Related Reading: Why Has Bitcoin Been Bearish Lately? CryptoQuant Head Chimes In In a Falling Wedge, the upper line of the pattern connects lower highs in the price, while the bottom one connects lower lows. Similarly, a Rising Wedge has the upper line joining together higher highs and the lower one with higher lows. Just like other TA consolidation patterns, the upper line may continue to act as a source of resistance in the near future, while the lower one may provide support. Also, a break out of either of these trendlines can suggest a continuation of pattern in that direction. Wedges specifically are considered to be formations that lead to a reversal, so a break in the direction opposite to that of the Wedge may be considered to be more likely. Dogecoin has recently been showing a Wedge-like consolidation towards the downside in recent months, so the coin may be forming a Falling Wedge pattern. Below is the chart shared by Ali that showcases this formation. As is visible in the graph, the Dogecoin price has recently made an apparent retest of the bottom line of this Falling Wedge pattern and has found support at it. Thus, it’s possible that DOGE may now see a surge towards the upper trendline. Before the coin retests the upper line, though, there is perhaps another important level it has to surpass first: the 0.236 Fibonacci Retracement level. Fibonacci Retracement levels are based on ratios that are found in the famous Fibonacci series. These levels correspond to the percentage of drawdown as measured between two fixed levels. In the current case, Ali has taken the top of the Falling Wedge as the start of these levels (that is, the 100% or 1 mark). Related Reading: Bitcoin Momentum Indicators Are All Showing Death Cross: Say Hello To Bear Market? The analyst notes that if Dogecoin can manage a sustained close above the $0.10 level (that is, above the 0.236 Fibonacci Retracement), it may be able to start a rally toward the $0.15 level. From the current price of the memecoin, such a potential run would mean an increase of around 53%. It now remains to be seen how DOGE develops in the coming days and whether it would be able to follow any similar trajectory or not. DOGE Price Dogecoin had fallen under the $0.090 mark a couple of days back, but the asset appears to have rebounded as it has now recovered to $0.098.

42390387,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1MUD,1725901836,Tether's $100M Investment in LatAm Agriculture Firm May Be a Tokenization Play,"Tether acquired a nearly 10% stake for $100 million in NYSE-listed agricultural conglomerate Adecoagro SA, a regulatory filing shows.  Agrotoken, together with Adecoagro, started the development of three stablecoins, SOYA, CORA and WHEA, which allow producers to have their own currency represented in grains, Agrotoken CEO Novillo Astrada said.  Tether is also working on a tokenization platform expected to launch later this year, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said earlier.  Tether, issuer of the $118 billion market cap stablecoin USDT, and its latest investment in a Latin American farming giant may not have much in common at first glance, but both companies share ambition in tokenization of real-world assets.  The stablecoin giant invested $100 million to acquire a 9.8% stake in Adecoagro SA (AGRO), a Luxembourg-based agricultural conglomerate that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, according to an August filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Adecoagro owns 213,500 hectares of farmland and industrial facilities spread across Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, with businesses in the crops, rice, dairy and sugarcane segments, according to its website. It produces 2.8 million tons of agricultural products and over 1 million MWh of renewable energy.  Adecoagro also has a minority stake in Agrotoken, an Argentina-based company that focuses on agricultural commodities tokenization. The company invested in the startup in 2021, which ""seeks to transform grains into a digital asset, to store or exchange for supplies, services, and other assets,"" according to Adecoagro's annual integrated report.  Agrotoken CEO and co-founder Eduardo Novillo Astrada said in a video posted on LinkedIn that Adecoagro was a founder of Agrotoken and owns a 10% stake in the startup.  ""Mariano Bosch, the CEO of Adecoagro, has always supported us,"" Novillo Astrada wrote. ""He had great vision and understood that what he wanted to do was tokenized land, something we are also working on together with Adecoagro and other major agricultural partners.""  Agrotoken claims to have transacted $70 million in tokenization deals with more than 250 merchants and over 40 grain holders, in addition to having interacted with more than 1,000 farmers and tokenizing 230,000 tonnes.  Together with Bosch, Agrotoken started the development of three stablecoins, SOYA, CORA and WHEA, according to Novillo Astrada, which allow producers to have their own currency represented in grains. ""This is a clear message of the connection between blockchain technology and agribusiness."" he said.  Agrotoken has already worked with firms such as Santander, partnering with the Spanish banking giant in 2022 to launch loans collateralized with tokenized commodities in Argentina.  ""Tether views land as a crucial asset class, complementing its existing investments in bitcoin and gold,"" a Tether spokesperson said in an email to CoinDesk. ""Land is inherently scarce, provides long-term yield, and has historically served as a safe haven during periods of geopolitical instability.""  Tether's tokenized RWA plans  Tether's ambition to venture into tokenized assets has been well-documented as the company aims to diversify from its highly profitable stablecoin business. The company reported $5.2 billion net profit in the first half of 2024.  Read more: Tether Reorganizes Into 4 Divisions as It Expands Beyond Stablecoins  The company issues the gold-backed stablecoin XAUT, which is the largest tokenized gold offering with a $615 million market capitalization.  CEO Paolo Ardoino outlined plans in April to launch a tokenization platform that would facilitate the creation of digital versions of a range of assets including bonds, stocks, funds and loyalty reward points.  The company also introduced in June a token minting platform called Alloy and a ""synthetic"" dollar token that users can create by posting XAUT as collateral. The platform ""allows users to create collateralized synthetic digital assets and would be part of Tether's digital assets tokenization platform, launching later this year,"" Ardoino said at the time.  Tether also invested in a slew of businesses over the past year, including a sustainable bitcoin mining operation in Uruguay, payment processor in Georgia and cloud computing firm Northern Data.

42390377,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1Lev,1725898897,"Coinbase Must Face Shareholder Lawsuit Over Regulator Risk Concerns, Judge Rules","A federal judge ruled that Coinbase shareholders brought plausible allegations about how the exchange portrayed the chances the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission might sue it.  The judge dismissed most of the other allegations brought in the shareholder lawsuit.  A U.S. judge denied in part last week Coinbase's request to dismiss a class action lawsuit from shareholders accusing the exchange of misleading them about its chances of being sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  A group of Coinbase shareholders sued the exchange in 2022, alleging the exchange ""made materially false and misleading statements"" about its operations and risk of regulatory action. United States District Judge Brian Martinotti, of the District of New Jersey, ruled Thursday that while the plaintiffs had a plausible case that Coinbase acted ""negligently"" when it came to regulatory action (the SEC did, in fact, sue Coinbase), they did not bring a plausible case for most of the allegations.  ""The Court finds Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Defendants misleadingly described a favorable picture of the improbability that the SEC would file an enforcement action by repeatedly emphasizing that the crypto assets they listed were not securities,"" said in a court document.  In June 2023, Coinbase was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on allegations that the exchange violated the U.S. federal securities law. Coinbase also lost most of the motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuit, meaning the judge overseeing that case found the SEC brought plausible arguments that can be debated more deeply in court.  The class action lawsuit dates back to 2021, when the plaintiffs said they first began buying shares, but was later modified in July 2023. Coinbase filed a briefing related to its motion to dismiss in December 2023.  The recent document by Judge Martinotti said Coinbase's motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part. Only count one ""to the extent it is premised upon the Proprietary Trading Statements and the Bankruptcy Statements that tout customers' trust in the Company, is granted"" while all other counts were denied.  In a statement, a Coinbase spokesperson said, ""the Court agreed that a significant portion of the plaintiff’s claims should be dismissed. It’s important to note that the remaining pieces are allowed to move forward because of the way this motion to dismiss works: the court draws inferences based on the plaintiff’s allegations rather than the reality of what happened. We remain confident that we are right on the facts and the law, and we look forward to proving the rest of our case.

33385179,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640798,1725897644,Why Has This New Casino Cryptocurrency Coin Became Bigger Than Brett (BRETT) and PEPE?,"The meme coin market has seen many entrants, with each trying to capture the excitement and attention of crypto investors. Among these, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has rapidly risen to prominence, surpassing meme giants like Brett (BRETT) and Pepecoin (PEPE). The question on everyone’s mind is: why has Mpeppe (MPEPE) become bigger than its competitors in such a short time? Let’s dive into the factors driving Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s explosive growth and why it’s outpacing Brett (BRETT) and Pepecoin (PEPE). 1. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Unique Casino Utility Unlike Brett (BRETT) and Pepecoin (PEPE), which rely mainly on community hype and meme culture, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers something tangible: casino utility. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has successfully integrated a De-Fi-powered gaming and sports betting ecosystem, allowing users to engage in online gambling using crypto. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Casino Utility Stands Out: Enhanced Security: Mpeppe (MPEPE) uses blockchain technology to ensure transparent and secure transactions in online casinos. Decentralized Governance: Users can participate in decision-making processes, further solidifying community involvement. Real-World Application: The integration of online gaming provides a direct use case, making Mpeppe (MPEPE) more than just a meme coin. 2. Instant Rewards and Stake Opportunities Another reason Mpeppe (MPEPE) has surged past Brett (BRETT) and Pepecoin (PEPE) is the availability of instant rewards. The ability to stake Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens and earn passive income through yield farming and liquidity pools offers investors more than just speculative profits. Why This Matters: Staking Opportunities: Users can stake Mpeppe (MPEPE) within De-Fi liquidity pools to earn rewards. Yield Farming: In addition to gambling, investors can participate in yield farming, generating returns on their holdings. 3. The Viral Influence of Meme Culture While Brett (BRETT) and Pepecoin (PEPE) certainly benefited from viral meme culture, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has taken it a step further by merging meme culture with the online casino experience. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s playful branding and marketing appeal to younger audiences, tapping into the viral nature of internet memes while offering an engaging product. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Viral Strategy: Internet Memes Meet Casino Fun: By linking gambling with meme culture, Mpeppe (MPEPE) attracts a broader, more engaged audience. Speculative Excitement: Like its competitors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) thrives on the speculative excitement that draws both seasoned investors and first-time traders. 4. Enhanced Privacy and Global Accessibility Cryptocurrencies have long promised anonymity and security, but Mpeppe (MPEPE) has taken this promise seriously, especially in the context of online gambling. The enhanced security and privacy features of Mpeppe (MPEPE) have drawn investors seeking safe, anonymous transactions in the online casino space. Key Features of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Global Accessibility: Cross-Border Transactions: Mpeppe (MPEPE) enables seamless gambling experiences across borders, overcoming traditional banking restrictions. Low-Cost and Fast Transactions: Thanks to blockchain, Mpeppe (MPEPE) allows users to gamble and transact quickly and affordably, making it ideal for online casinos. Conclusion: Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is Outperforming Brett (BRETT) and Pepecoin (PEPE) Mpeppe (MPEPE), a unique meme coin, has become the market leader due to its casino utility, real-world applications, and community-driven approach. It combines gambling excitement with meme culture’s viral appeal, attracting a broader audience. As investors recognize its long-term potential, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s position in the meme coin space is expected to strengthen.

33385176,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640788,1725897625,Pepecoin vs Mpeppe: Pepe Coin Investors Make A Move Into Mpeppe Casino For Pepecoin Utility and Profits,"The meme coin market has become a haven for investors looking to tap into explosive gains within a short period. Among the most recognized meme tokens is PepeCoin (PEPE), which made waves earlier in 2024 with its rapid price surges. However, as the excitement around PepeCoin (PEPE) begins to cool, many investors are shifting their focus to a new contender—Mpeppe (MPEPE). Unlike traditional meme coins, Mpeppe (MPEPE) promises not only speculative gains but also real-world utility through its upcoming casino platform, offering PepeCoin (PEPE) investors a fresh opportunity for growth. Pepecoin’s Struggles and Investor Exodus Earlier this year, PepeCoin (PEPE) reached impressive heights, captivating the attention of meme coin enthusiasts. However, the token has since faced a significant decline. August proved to be a particularly tough month, with PepeCoin (PEPE) posting its third consecutive monthly loss, closing at $0.000007 in September—a sharp drop from its peak of $0.000017 in May. This downward spiral has left many PepeCoin (PEPE) holders rethinking their strategies and looking for alternatives. A notable trend in the PepeCoin (PEPE) market has been the exodus of whale investors. Many of these large holders, who once bet big on PepeCoin (PEPE), have been moving their investments into new projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE), which is proving to be a more stable and promising option. While PepeCoin (PEPE) still holds a place in the meme coin world, the lack of real utility and the ongoing price decline have pushed investors to seek out more innovative opportunities with long-term potential. Mpeppe Casino: A New Opportunity for Pepecoin Investors For PepeCoin (PEPE) investors looking for a fresh opportunity, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a top contender. With a presale price of just $0.0021, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is attracting investors from across the meme coin community, especially those who are keen on finding a project with a practical use case and a clear growth trajectory. Unlike PepeCoin (PEPE), which has largely been driven by speculative trading, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is launching with a real-world utility: an online casino platform that leverages blockchain technology. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) casino will offer decentralized and transparent gaming experiences, with provably fair games that can attract a global audience. In addition, Mpeppe (MPEPE) plans to integrate a profit-sharing model, enabling investors to benefit from staking rewards and weekly dividends. This utility adds a layer of stability and profitability that PepeCoin (PEPE) has struggled to achieve. Why Mpeppe Stands Out The integration of a decentralized online casino within the Mpeppe (MPEPE) ecosystem is one of the key factors drawing PepeCoin (PEPE) investors to the project. The casino will offer a range of games that operate on smart contracts, ensuring fairness and transparency, two elements that resonate with blockchain enthusiasts. This added utility positions Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a unique player in the emerging “GambleFi” sector, which merges decentralized finance (DeFi) with online gaming. For many PepeCoin (PEPE) investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a chance to diversify their portfolios with a project that not only rides on meme coin hype but also offers tangible, long-term value. The profit-sharing mechanism is particularly appealing, as it allows investors to earn passive income while holding their tokens. As the presale continues to gain traction, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is proving to be a strong contender for investors looking to capitalize on both speculative gains and sustainable utility. Comparing the Future of Pepecoin and Mpeppe As PepeCoin (PEPE) continues to lose value, the outlook for the token remains uncertain. Analysts predict that PepeCoin (PEPE) could face further dips, potentially falling to as low as $0.000006 if its current downtrend persists. For many PepeCoin (PEPE) holders, the lack of a clear use case has become a major concern, as the token’s value is driven solely by market speculation. In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioned to capitalize on its innovative approach to combining meme coin excitement with decentralized online gaming. The presale has already seen substantial interest, with over 67% of the tokens sold. Investors are particularly optimistic about an 800% surge in value before the official launch, making Mpeppe (MPEPE) one of the most promising projects in the meme coin space. Why Pepecoin Investors Are Flocking to Mpeppe The shift from PepeCoin (PEPE) to Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a broader trend within the meme coin market: investors are seeking projects with both hype and real-world application. While PepeCoin (PEPE) remains a well-known name in the meme coin sector, its inability to sustain its early momentum has led many to explore other options. With its decentralized casino platform and profit-sharing model, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique blend of meme coin culture and tangible value. The project’s utility, combined with the excitement around its presale, is attracting a wide range of investors, from long-time PepeCoin (PEPE) holders to newcomers eager to participate in the next big thing. Conclusion: The Future Belongs to Mpeppe As PepeCoin (PEPE) struggles to regain its former glory, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a strong alternative for those looking to stay within the meme coin ecosystem while securing more stable, long-term returns. The launch of the Mpeppe (MPEPE) casino, combined with its profit-sharing model, makes it a compelling investment for anyone looking to capitalize on the next wave of meme coin innovation. With its presale already proving successful, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is set to become a major player in both the meme coin and decentralized gaming spaces.

33385173,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640786,1725897620,STRK vs Mpeppe: Ethereum Investors Search For New 1000X Cryptos In Ethereum Ecosystem,"As Ethereum (ETH) continues to evolve, investors are constantly on the lookout for the next big opportunity within its ecosystem. Two names that have caught their attention are Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both projects are poised to offer high returns, but they differ in their focus and approach. In this article, we’ll explore how these two emerging tokens are drawing attention from Ethereum investors seeking the next 1000X opportunity. Starknet (STRK): Solving Ethereum’s Scalability Challenges Starknet (STRK) has been gaining momentum as a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum (ETH), designed to tackle the long-standing issue of scalability on the network. Ethereum’s popularity has often led to congestion, slow transaction speeds, and high gas fees, which make it less appealing for mainstream users. Starknet aims to solve these problems by using ZK-rollups, a technology that bundles multiple transactions together before submitting them to the Ethereum mainnet, drastically improving speed and reducing costs. STRK has experienced a notable rise in recent weeks, with a 15.5% increase over the past seven days. The surge was primarily driven by Vitalik Buterin’s recent movement of over 1.26 million STRK tokens into his personal wallet. This move was interpreted by the market as a show of confidence in the project, leading to an influx of interest from investors. Currently trading around $0.43, Starknet’s growing network and upcoming staking mechanism, which is set to launch in October 2024, have positioned it as a strong contender for Ethereum investors looking for long-term growth. Moreover, Starknet’s “Bolt Upgrade” has made the network faster and more efficient, reducing transaction times and costs by significant margins. These upgrades have not only attracted developers to build on the network but have also garnered the attention of investors seeking exposure to Ethereum’s scaling solutions. With an expanding community and technological advancements, Starknet is showing signs of becoming a critical infrastructure for Ethereum’s future. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Bringing Utility to the Meme Coin Market While Starknet is focused on scalability, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is looking to revolutionize a completely different sector within the Ethereum ecosystem: online gambling. Meme coins have often been dismissed as speculative assets with little real-world utility, but Mpeppe (MPEPE) is changing that perception by launching a decentralized casino platform built on Ethereum (ETH). Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) decentralized casino will provide users with a transparent and fair gaming experience, using blockchain technology to ensure that all transactions are provably fair. The casino will feature various games, all of which are powered by smart contracts, ensuring that players receive their winnings without the need for intermediaries. This use of blockchain not only enhances security but also allows players from across the world to participate without worrying about geographical restrictions or currency conversions. Currently priced at just $0.0021 in its presale, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining significant attention from Ethereum investors looking for the next big project with real-world applications. With over 67% of the tokens already sold, the presale is moving quickly, and many believe that the casino’s profit-sharing model—offering weekly dividends and staking rewards—could lead to explosive growth once the platform officially launches. The unique combination of meme coin hype and real utility is what sets Mpeppe apart from other projects in the Ethereum ecosystem. STRK vs Mpeppe: Which One Holds 1000X Potential? Both Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer different types of opportunities for Ethereum investors. Starknet is more focused on solving the technical issues of scalability, making it a project with a solid foundation in the blockchain infrastructure space. The recent price surge and staking mechanism suggest that it has strong long-term potential, especially as Ethereum continues to face congestion issues. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is tapping into the booming online gambling industry with a decentralized casino. The project’s unique approach to combining meme culture with blockchain utility is generating significant buzz, and early investors are banking on its profit-sharing model and gaming platform to drive massive returns. Conclusion: A Diversified Approach For Ethereum investors looking to diversify, both Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) present compelling opportunities. Starknet offers a long-term investment in the core infrastructure of Ethereum, while Mpeppe provides an exciting, high-reward gamble on the growing intersection of meme coins and decentralized finance. As these two projects continue to develop, they could become pivotal players in Ethereum’s ever-expanding ecosystem. Whether you’re looking for steady growth or explosive 1000X potential, both Starknet and Mpeppe are projects to keep an eye on in 2024 and beyond.

33385170,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640784,1725897619,Ethereum Struggles To Fight Bearish Trend As Optimism (OP) Makes Moves Against Downtard Pressure,"Ethereum (ETH) has faced significant challenges recently, grappling with bearish market trends that have left many investors uncertain. However, new developments in layer-2 solutions such as Optimism (OP) and emerging meme coin projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) are offering some hope. These projects provide innovative solutions that could alleviate Ethereum’s struggles while fostering greater efficiency and community engagement. As Ethereum (ETH) seeks to overcome its scalability and cost challenges, layer-2 protocols like Optimism (OP) are stepping in with promising solutions. At the same time, projects like aim to bring fresh utility and excitement to the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem. Let’s explore how Optimism (OP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are making their mark in the crypto world and how they might contribute to Ethereum (ETH)’s recovery. The Rise of Optimism (OP): Scaling Ethereum with Layer-2 Solutions Optimism (OP) is a leading layer-2 blockchain built on Ethereum (ETH), utilizing optimistic rollups to enhance scalability and reduce gas fees. By moving a portion of transactions off-chain and only settling final results on Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP) offers a much-needed solution for Ethereum (ETH)’s long-standing scalability issues. This allows the Ethereum (ETH) network to handle more transactions per second, providing a faster and more cost-effective experience for users. In the current market, Optimism (OP) has shown resilience despite broader economic challenges. With a 2.98% price increase, Optimism (OP) is trading at $1.39 as of September 7, 2024. Its liquidity remains high, boasting a volume-to-market cap ratio of 0.2575, which makes it easier for traders to move in and out of positions. Optimism (OP) recorded 13 green days in the past month, demonstrating its ability to perform even amid market volatility. As one of the top gainers in the crypto space, Optimism (OP) continues to build on its core principles of simplicity, pragmatism, and sustainability. Despite facing resistance, being 12.96% below its 200-day simple moving average of $1.60, Optimism (OP) remains a key player in Ethereum (ETH)’s scaling solutions, showing growth potential in the long term. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Bridging Meme Culture and Blockchain Innovation While Optimism (OP) tackles the technical challenges of Ethereum (ETH), Mpeppe (MPEPE) brings a different kind of innovation. As a meme coin inspired by both the legendary Pepecoin and soccer superstar Kylian Mbappé, Mpeppe (MPEPE) aims to revolutionize the meme coin space with real-world utility. Built on Ethereum (ETH), Mpeppe is creating a decentralized ecosystem for gaming and sports betting, attracting both soccer fans and crypto enthusiasts. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers more than just entertainment value it integrates decentralized finance (DeFi) features, allowing users to stake their tokens for rewards, participate in online gambling, and trade unique Player Card NFTs. With over 1.6 billion tokens already sold and the presale nearing its end, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has captured significant attention from the Ethereum (ETH) community. The project’s focus on creating a sustainable, vibrant community aligns with Ethereum’s goal of fostering innovative decentralized applications (dApps). Mpeppe (MPEPE) also leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency and security, particularly in its gaming and sports betting platform, where all transactions are recorded on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. As Ethereum (ETH) transitions toward Ethereum 2.0, projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) provide additional use cases that could help strengthen the ecosystem. Optimism (OP)’s Role in Alleviating Ethereum’s Market Woes The performance of Optimism (OP) stands out in the current market. Optimism (OP) has successfully positioned itself as a solution to Ethereum’s scalability issues, and its adoption continues to grow. The layer-2 protocol’s focus on reducing complexity while ensuring a secure and efficient system resonates with Ethereum (ETH) developers and users alike. Despite Ethereum (ETH)’s bearish trend, Optimism (OP) has shown signs of stability, with 43% positive trading days in the last 30 days.

Together, these projects highlight the versatility and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. Conclusion: Optimism (OP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Offer Hope for Ethereum As Ethereum continues to face bearish market pressure, the rise of innovative projects like Optimism (OP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides a glimmer of hope.

Related Reading: Helium (HNT) Network Expansion Fuels 13% Gains Despite Faltering Market Despite the recent dip in value, Gagain was still very optimistic about SHIB. This contrasts with the current SHIB price forecast of a -0.87% decrease, with a predicted price of $0.00001301 by October 9, 2024. Gagain believes that Shiba Inu will experience a large rally soon, now being the 13th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Very Bullish On $SHIB. — JAKE (@JakeGagain) September 8, 2024 Investor Confidence Amid Price Dips The predictions of Gagain were not borne out of recent performances by Shiba Inu. The cryptocurrency had nosedived to $0.00001244 on September 6 from its daily high of $0.00001339, reflecting a slump of 7.09%. This was greatly influenced by the weak ISM Manufacturing data whose shockwaves were still being felt within the general financial market. The data showed the PMI index slipping to 47.2 below what was expected in the market. As a result, the cryptocurrency giant, Bitcoin, sank from around $58 000 to $53 000, pulling all tides of many altcoins, Shiba Inu included. Shiba Inu: Expanding Ecosystem Despite being in a downtrend at the moment, there is much going on within the Shiba Inu ecosystem that may make Gagain so optimistic. The meme coin has moved past just being a token into a more complex ecosystem. It now comprises a play-to-earn game called Shiba Eternity, a decentralized exchange – ShibaSwap – and even a metaverse project called Shib: The Metaverse. Related Reading: Ether Liquidity Plummets 40% On Exchanges After ETF Debut On top of that is perhaps the introduction of ShibTorch, an automated burn portal reducing the circulating supply of SHIB, as another potential catalyst of increases in the future. It may be partly for such reasons that Gagain, along with his community of enthusiasts, has much to remain optimistic about in the long term for SHIB. Technical Analysis and Market Sentiment Shiba Inu’s technical indicators right now are mixed. At 26, the Fear & Greed Index shows that asset-owning investors are in fear. With 14 out of 30 days in the green over the past month, the meme coin shows a really good performance rate of 47%. Still, the digital asset has undoubtedly created erratic price fluctuations with a volatility rate of 4.39%. While Gagain’s bullish outlook indeed offers a brighter perspective, current market conditions remain cautious. The combination of bearish sentiment and high volatility, therefore, would call for caution from potential investors. Besides these recent price dips, several of the ongoing projects and ecosystem developments hold long-term value. Yet, the present market environment has a twist leading to fear and uncertainty, and now is probably not a good time to venture into SHIB. Investors will weigh these facts before making any decision.

The first of these scenarios is a breakout from the falling wedge pattern that has formed on the 1-Day timeframe. If this breakout happens, then the Ethereum price could rocket from here. In addition to this, the crypto analyst has also outlined a bullish divergence on the MACD for the Ethereum price, which lends credence to a possible breakout from the falling wedge pattern. However, on the flip side, where the price does not break out from this pattern, the cryptocurrency’s price is expected to fall. This is due to the mounting bearish pressure on the second-largest crypto by market cap as large holders continue sell-offs over the last month. Also, the analyst explains that the fifth wave could end up playing out, something that could push the price even higher. Where Can The ETH Price Go From Here? The bullish scenario following a breakout is especially important for the Ethereum price as it could put an end to the bearishness that has rocked the price. In the analysis, the crypto analyst outlines that a breakout from here would send the ETH price as high as $3,000, which is a more than 30% increase from here.

However, if there is a breakdown in the price, then the Ethereum price could be seeing another decline below $2,000. The analyst’s chart puts the altcoin price as low as $1,778. Such a development, coupled with the poor volume for ETH so far, could trigger a further breakdown to $1,500.

42390391,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1Mjb,1725891917,Crypto’s Venture Capital Gap,"Decentralization is a hotly debated topic in Web3, but one area where it may be stifling innovation is venture capital. In Web2, the concentration of venture capital in the Bay Area created a clear hub where founders knew they needed to be. Today, with top builders scattered across the globe, the lack of a central hub may be preventing some of the most promising innovators from accessing the resources they need to build, launch, and scale the companies that could drive the industry forward.  Consider the example of a founder building an artificial intelligence (AI) company in Web2. If you’re developing AI products anywhere in the world, it's widely accepted that you need to find your way to the Bay Area. This is because the Bay Area hosts many of the world’s top venture capitalists (VCs), a high concentration of talented professionals, successful companies that serve as inspiration, and accelerators like Y Combinator.  Of course, there are drawbacks to this concentration, as with any situation, and opportunity costs exist on both sides. To name a few challenges, obtaining a U.S. visa remains one of the most difficult hurdles for international founders. On top of that, the exorbitant cost of living in the Bay Area is well-documented. For most people, relocating means moving to a place where they have no friends or family, which brings its own set of mental and emotional health challenges.  Additionally, figuring out how to build a network in a new city, often far from anything familiar, is no easy task. Yet, there are numerous examples of people who have successfully navigated these challenges, building companies worth billions over the decades. While it’s not easy, the conventional wisdom around it suggests that it is still achievable.  Read more: Azeem Khan - It’s Time to Build a Sustainable Blockchain Ecosystem  Now, contrast this with a founder based in Ghana, Argentina or Vietnam. Builders from regions like South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia often have real use cases where blockchain can improve daily life, particularly due to the lack of robust infrastructure in areas like banking, or because younger populations are more willing to adopt new technology. While there are likely phenomenal builders in these regions, without established networks or relationships, they are at a significant disadvantage when it comes to scaling their projects into fully developed companies. Without a concentrated hub or strong relationships, these builders face significant challenges in bringing their innovations to a global scale.  Building hubs of innovation requires more than just venture capital, but since it's the job of VCs to find and fund the best companies, a major obstacle arises when there’s a disconnect between top builders and the venture money that could fuel their ideas. This likely means that, even with groundbreaking ideas and the talent to build on them, many potential entrepreneurs are left without access to the necessary resources. In this context, having some degree of centralization — particularly in innovation hubs — can actually serve as a positive catalyst for growth.  There’s a prevailing sentiment on Crypto Twitter is that nothing exciting is happening and that no one is building consumer applications to onboard the masses. Some even believe that venture capitalists aren’t funding these projects because they’re seen as caricatures of capitalism, focused solely on backing the next infrastructure company for their own gain.  But what if we’re looking at the problem from the wrong angle? Isn’t it possible that some of the best builders, particularly in the Global South, simply don’t have access to the resources needed to launch companies that could bring users on-chain? If we accept that premise, then the solution would be to build the necessary bridges, wouldn’t it?  Some of the best builders, particularly in the Global South, simply don’t have access to the resources needed to launch companies that could bring users on-chain  The reality is that it’s neither feasible nor likely for venture capital to be present everywhere at once. Even as the industry matures and more venture capital flows into Web3 companies, it’s unrealistic to expect that funding can be equally distributed across the globe. We’re already seeing certain hubs emerge as go-to destinations for innovators, drawn by factors such as regulatory ease, visa access, cost of living, climate, and time zones. Cities like New York, Lisbon, Dubai, Singapore, and Buenos Aires are among those places slowly becoming hubs. But as this maturity will take time, the question remains: what can we do in the meantime to catalyze innovation?  Read more: Azeem Khan - What Does It Actually Take to Build a Blockchain?  None of this suggests the future is bleak. There are numerous credible examples of both online and offline initiatives aimed at onboarding builders globally. Pop-up cities and network states like Zuzalu and Edge Esmeralda are gaining popularity, focusing on unconventional locations for tech innovation and bringing together young innovators from around the world. Projects like Developer DAO are working to educate and onboard more builders into Web3, while BuidlGuild focuses on doing the same, with an emphasis on Ethereum.  Events like ETH Accra and ETH Vietnam, which take place year-round in a decentralized manner, are gathering builders in global cities to work on exciting projects. Companies like ETHGlobal host hackathons both digitally and physically throughout the year, and the Ethereum Foundation’s (EF) Devcon Scholars Program has successfully onboarded new talent by covering the costs for participants from around the world to join and learn about Ethereum.  The EF also gives discounted tickets for locals who want to attend. The folks putting efforts towards builders and growth are there and these are examples of how venture capitalists can deploy capital more intelligently, allowing their sourcing to be done for them. And the smartest of them will do so. Some already are.  Decentralization comes with challenges and opportunities. The problems discussed above will eventually be solved — likely by innovative thinkers who build bridges between those with resources and those who need them to create companies. In hindsight, it may seem simple, but the key will be funding the people on the ground doing the hard work. Often, those pushing the industry forward are the least well-funded. If we want to accelerate the pace of adoption, we need to speed up the rate at which we’re funding those tackling the toughest challenges.  So, for those venture capitalists trying to figure out where to put their marketing budgets, don’t do the fancy dinner at the next conference, do something different by directly funding the initiatives that bring builders together, onboard new talent, and tackle the real challenges of scaling Web3.

42390380,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1LuJ,1725891546,"Kamala Harris Will 'Win' First Debate With Trump, Polymarket Traders Are Betting","This week in prediction markets:  Harris primed for post-debate polling ""win"" after Trump odds survive highly unprofitable trading strategy.  Kalshi bettors say Harvard applications will fall as Gay leaves a dark cloud.  No Canadian election in 2024.  The second U.S. Presidential debate, and the first with now Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, is scheduled for Sept. 10 on ABC.  With the total amount bet on the Polymarket election contract approaching $850 million in the days leading up to the debate, bettors are still giving former President Donald Trump an edge against Harris, with the odds at 52-46. Polymarket is a blockchain-based platform, programmed onto the Polygon network as a smart contract, and bettors ante up by depositing the stablecoin USDC, a type of dollar-linked token.     Then it gets a bit meta, with prediction markets about polls (something prediction markets are supposed to be an alternative to) and even prediction markets about other prediction markets.  Polymarket traders are betting the traditional pollsters will give the debate to Harris, with a 75% chance that the Ipsos/538 survey will find she ""wins"" it.  At the same time, bettors also have their money on this ""win"" not mattering much.  Harris, in their eyes, only has a 22% chance of retaking the lead in the main Polymarket election contract the day after the debate. (Yes, there are Polymarket contracts about other other Polymarket contracts.)  The debate is also expected to draw an audience of well over 70 million people, which may put it in range of challenging the first Clinton-Trump debate, which holds the record as the highest-rated at 84 million, followed by the second Carter-Reagan debate, which had an audience of 80.6 million.  Meanwhile, the market seems to have righted itself after a very expensive failed manipulation attempt over the weekend.  The manipulation, on-chain data suggests, involved a group of whale accounts, led by DJTHolder, which apparently tried to artificially juice Harris' odds in the U.S. Presidential Election Winner market to profit from a derivative market that resolved based on the leading candidate on Sept. 6.  This group burned through $9 million of USDC and simultaneously bought large amounts of Kamala YES shares and Trump NO shares, temporarily driving Harris shares' price by anywhere from 2 cents to 27 cents. (Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true and zilch if not, so Harris' current 47 cent price indicates a 47% chance of victory.) The price subsequently fell back to Earth.  Despite spending millions, they failed to keep Kamala’s odds above Trump’s, leading to over $60,000 of USDC-denominated losses in the derivative market and six-figure losses in the main election market.  Right now, the apparent ring leader, DJTHolder, is showing a total loss on his account of over $46,000 based on $2.9 million in positions.  A highly profitable trading strategy this was not. They probably should have tried this first in the Minecraft version of Polymarket.  School takes hard knocks  The legacy of former Harvard President Claudine Gay, who departed this year over plagiarism allegations and an increase in violent anti-Semitism on campus, still hangs dark over the institution she once presided over.  Bettors on Kalshi are predicting another drop in applications for Harvard in 2025, for the class of 2029, forecasting the number to come in below the 54,008 undergraduate applications received in 2024 for the class of 2028.  While other elite institutions like Yale and Columbia reported increases in their application numbers, Gay’s legacy remains a burden. To her harshest critics, her legacy embodies everything that is wrong with post-secondary academia.  Many, including the university's largest donors, would like to see changes at Harvard, including more ideological diversity, and the dismantling of racial preferences in its admissions policy. While it seems that Harvard has acknowledged this and has begun to make changes, the market is still betting this won’t be enough to sway things meaningfully.  With all this talk of prediction markets and Harvard presidents, remember that one of the journalists whose work on accelerated Gay’s departure lost money betting on it on Polymarket.  Read more: He Exposed Harvard President's Plagiarism, Then Lost Money Betting on the Story  Kalshi, which unlike Polymarket is regulated in the U.S. and settles trades in dollars, won a court fight last week over its plan to offer election contracts. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has asked the judge to delay the listing another two weeks.  Read more: U.S. Election Betting Delay Would Be 'Devastating' to Kalshi, Firm Says  Canucks shook  Polymarket bettors are giving a 22% chance of a Canadian election happening in 2024, despite a recent political shake-up, which makes it a possibility on paper.  Justin Trudeau won the last Canadian election, which took place in September 2021, with a minority government.  In Canada’s Westminster system, inherited from the United Kingdom, a minority government can fall if it loses a key vote in the House of Commons, like on the budget or a confidence motion, because it doesn't have enough seats to pass laws without help from other parties.  To prevent the Conservative party, led by an increasingly popular Pierre Poilievre, from triggering a motion of non-confidence that would call an election, Trudeau’s Liberals entered into something called a Supply-and-Confidence Agreement with the leftist New Democrat Party (NDP), which guaranteed a supply of votes should the Liberals support various NDP motions in Parliament.  That agreement ended last week.  The NDP ended its agreement with the Liberals because of frustration over the slow progress on pharmacare, a program to provide affordable prescription medications for all Canadians, and their opposition to how the Liberals handled labor strikes, which went against the NDP’s pro-union stance.  They also wanted to distance themselves from the unpopular government before the next election, and Canada’s CBC television network reported that the decision was made to pull the plug in June as Poilievre’s numbers surged.  So does this mean that the Trudeau government can fall with the next vote in Parliament? Not necessarily.  The Bloc Quebecois, a party that sits in Canada’s federal parliament but has the sole mandate of getting the best deal for Quebec, says it is willing to make deals with Trudeau’s Liberals to get more support for their pet issues like increased immigration powers for Quebec and more funding for the province’s infrastructure and seniors.  There’s also the option to ""prorogue"" parliament, which involves asking Canada’s governor general, the King’s representative in the country, and head of state by legal formality, to put a temporary pause on things and reconvene the House at a later date.  While there’s plenty of precedent for doing this, Trudeau did it in 2020 to fend off a growing scandal, and former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper did it twice, once in 2008 to avoid a non-confidence vote and in 2009 to delay investigations into an Afghanistan detainees controversy and strengthen his position during the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. The maneuver is immensely unpopular with voters.  It looks like Polymarket bettors think Quebec has all the cards, and will keep Parliament functioning and Trudeau in power. But right now, this is a thinly traded market, and the balance might shift when more liquidity enters the fray.",NEUTRAL,USDC,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | USDC,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/09/09/kamala-harris-will-win-first-debate-with-trump-polymarket-traders-are-betting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c8d233f181b3cacbbc7dc5083937791d75743fe-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Most of the money fled bitcoin {{BTC}} products as investors withdrew from spot U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the largest cryptocurrency for a record eight straight days.  Bitcoin products registered outflows of $643 million, while their ether {{ETH}} equivalents lost $98 million, according to digital asset manager CoinShares. The outflows were almost entirely concentrated in U.S., with $721 million leaving the market, CoinShares said.  Bitcoin fell more than 8% during the week, closing out Friday at $54,000 having traded around $59,000 on Sept. 2. The period was a busy one for economic data out of the U.S., with all of the readings – including the widely watched nonfarm payrolls report – coming in weak.

Let’s explore why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing attention and whether Dogecoin (DOGE) can withstand the current market challenges. Dogecoin’s Bearish Trend: Will DOGE Rebound or Continue to Struggle? Dogecoin (DOGE), once a leading meme coin, has experienced considerable volatility in recent months. Despite its strong community and backing from prominent figures like Elon Musk, Dogecoin (DOGE) has struggled to regain its former highs. As the market continues to fluctuate, investors are beginning to question whether Dogecoin (DOGE) will see a significant recovery or continue to trend downward. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Fun Engaging Platform In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has surged in popularity due to its innovative approach to combining meme culture with real-world utility in the mobile gaming and online gambling sectors.

With mobile gaming on the rise, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fun, engaging platform that allows users to leverage their tokens for a variety of purposes, from staking to gaming rewards. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Casino and Mobile Gaming Features Are So Attractive to DOGE Whales One of the key reasons Dogecoin (DOGE) whales are adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios is the latter’s focus on mobile gaming and casino platforms. Unlike many traditional meme coins, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers actual utility through its gaming and gambling ecosystem. Players can earn and use MPEPE tokens across various De-Fi platforms, allowing them to participate in yield farming, staking, and liquidity mining while engaging in thrilling online games and betting. Why Meme Coins Like Mpeppe (MPEPE) Appeal to Investors Meme cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE) are notorious for their speculative nature, adding an element of excitement and risk that many crypto investors find appealing. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has capitalized on this by combining viral marketing with tangible use cases, making it more than just a hype-driven token. This mix of volatility and utility has drawn significant interest from Dogecoin (DOGE) whales looking for new opportunities in the meme coin sector. How Mpeppe (MPEPE) Creates Instant Rewards for Its Users Another attractive feature of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its instant rewards system. Players and investors alike can earn rewards through the platform’s MPEPE Casino, which uses $MPEPE and other cryptocurrencies to enhance the gaming experience.

Conclusion: Diversification Is Key In a volatile market, diversification is essential for long-term success.

Recently, some of the largest Uniswap (UNI) investors have begun accumulating new and promising Ethereum-based meme coins, hoping to capitalize on potential 100X gains. Among the standout contenders is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a memecoin merging sports fandom with blockchain technology. As Uniswap (UNI) continues to perform well despite broader market challenges, the addition of Mpeppe (MPEPE) to whale investors’ portfolios suggests there’s significant belief in the future success of this memecoin. Uniswap (UNI): Resilience Amid Market Challenges Uniswap (UNI) has been a standout performer this month, defying the bearish trends affecting much of the crypto market. With its price up 16% in September and an impressive 45% year-to-date, Uniswap (UNI) continues to cement its position as one of the most successful decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Uniswap (UNI) allows users to trade tokens without the need for intermediaries, making it an essential tool for investors seeking decentralized trading solutions. Despite these gains, Uniswap (UNI) is still down over 85% from its all-time high (ATH) in May 2021. This significant decline has left some investors wondering when UNI will recover to its previous highs. However, whale investors have started to accumulate tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE), indicating they see potential in smaller, innovative projects to fuel future growth. These whales’ optimism suggests that while Uniswap (UNI) may be down from its ATH, it’s far from out of the race. Why Whales Are Turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) Mpeppe (MPEPE) is one of the latest memecoins capturing the attention of the crypto community. Built on Ethereum, Mpeppe combines the excitement of sports fandom with the viral power of meme culture. Inspired by Pepecoin and the soccer sensation Kylian Mbappé, Mpeppe offers much more than just meme appeal. It’s creating an entire ecosystem for decentralized gaming, sports betting, and unique Player Card NFTs, positioning itself as a major player in both the meme and GambleFi sectors. Whale investors on Uniswap (UNI) are taking notice of Mpeppe’s potential, particularly because of its strong community backing and unique utility. The token’s presale has already seen more than 1.6 billion tokens sold, and it’s showing no signs of slowing down. For Uniswap (UNI) whales, Mpeppe represents an opportunity to get in early on a project that could deliver massive returns, especially as the broader market waits for “Alt Season” to kick in. Uniswap (UNI) Whale Strategy: Betting on the Next Big Memecoins Whale investors on Uniswap (UNI) are known for making strategic moves in the crypto market, often setting the tone for broader market sentiment. Their interest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) and other Ethereum-based memecoins highlights their belief in the potential for massive gains. Uniswap (UNI) offers the perfect platform for these investors to access such opportunities, providing the liquidity and ease of trading that whales need to execute large transactions efficiently. The recent surge in Uniswap (UNI) activity shows that whales are actively looking for the next big thing in the memecoin space. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its innovative approach and strong presale performance, is high on their radar. These investors are banking on the possibility that projects like Mpeppe could yield 100X returns, just as early adopters of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu saw astronomical gains in the past. The Continued Performance of Uniswap (UNI) While Uniswap (UNI) whales are diversifying into new memecoins, it’s important to note that Uniswap itself has performed admirably in a challenging market. With its price up 16% this month, Uniswap (UNI) has shown resilience that few other tokens can match. Its role as a decentralized exchange on Ethereum means that it continues to attract a wide variety of users, from retail traders to large-scale investors. Uniswap’s (UNI) current price of $4.50 may be well below its ATH, but its year-to-date performance demonstrates strong fundamentals. As more memecoins like Mpeppe (MPEPE) gain popularity, Uniswap (UNI) stands to benefit from increased trading volume on its platform. The connection between whale activity and Uniswap’s (UNI) performance highlights the importance of the DEX in shaping the future of crypto markets. Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Uniswap (UNI): A Winning Combination? The strategic moves by Uniswap (UNI) whale investors to accumulate Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlight a growing trend in the cryptocurrency space: the rise of innovative memecoins with real utility. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is creating a decentralized gaming and sports betting ecosystem that goes beyond simple speculation, offering users the chance to participate in real-world activities and earn rewards. This unique blend of utility and meme appeal makes it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Uniswap (UNI), as one of the largest decentralized exchanges, plays a critical role in facilitating access to projects like Mpeppe. Its ability to provide liquidity and low fees ensures that investors can easily trade tokens like Mpeppe, helping these projects gain traction in the market. Conclusion: Uniswap (UNI) Whales See Potential in Mpeppe (MPEPE) As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Uniswap (UNI) whale investors are positioning themselves for potential 100X gains by adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios. With Uniswap (UNI) remaining one of the best-performing cryptos this month, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) making waves in the meme and GambleFi sectors, the combination of these two projects could prove to be a winning strategy. While Uniswap (UNI) may still be recovering from its ATH, its role as a leading decentralized exchange ensures that it will remain a key player in the crypto space.

Recently, Uniswap (UNI) has seen a significant uptick in trading volume, driven by both its settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the anticipation of new projects launching on its platform. One such project is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a cryptocurrency casino that is gearing up for its debut on Uniswap, and investors are already anticipating major gains. Uniswap (UNI) and the Rise in Ethereum DEX Volume Uniswap (UNI) is one of the most successful decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. Following its settlement with the CFTC, Uniswap saw its transaction volume rise by 14.2% to $5.7 billion. This surge came during a period of market retreat, where other DEX platforms like Solana and Tron experienced declines in activity. Uniswap’s ability to maintain robust transaction volume, even amid market volatility, reinforces its position as a key player in the DeFi space. The settlement with the CFTC required Uniswap to pay a $175,000 fine and halt its margin products in the U.S. This move removed some regulatory uncertainty around the platform, allowing Uniswap (UNI) to regain the trust of its users and rebuild momentum. The company’s trading volume increase in recent weeks reflects this renewed investor confidence. Along with Uniswap (UNI), other Ethereum DEXs like Curve Finance and Balancer also experienced significant volume growth, further indicating a resurgence in DeFi activity. As Ethereum (ETH) remains the dominant blockchain for decentralized finance, the continued growth of platforms like Uniswap (UNI) suggests a bright future for innovative projects launching on these platforms, including Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Casino Platform for the DeFi Generation Mpeppe (MPEPE) is an Ethereum-based meme coin with a unique twist—it’s also a fully functioning decentralized casino platform. Inspired by the viral appeal of meme coins like Pepecoin and the world of sports betting, Mpeppe aims to revolutionize online gambling by creating a transparent, fair, and decentralized casino experience. Built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, Mpeppe (MPEPE) will allow users to participate in various gaming and betting activities while earning rewards through staking and liquidity provision. The platform’s decentralized nature ensures that all transactions are transparent, recorded on the blockchain, and immune to manipulation. With its upcoming launch on Uniswap (UNI), Mpeppe (MPEPE) is generating significant buzz among both meme coin enthusiasts and investors interested in decentralized gambling platforms. The project’s innovative blend of fun and functionality positions it to capture a significant share of the growing GambleFi sector, where users seek opportunities to earn while enjoying online games and betting. The Impact of Uniswap’s (UNI) Settlement and Growth Uniswap’s (UNI) recent settlement with the CFTC has cleared a significant regulatory hurdle for the platform. The settlement allowed Uniswap to address legal challenges while continuing to operate as one of the largest decentralized exchanges on Ethereum (ETH). This regulatory clarity has been a key factor in the platform’s volume surge, as investors feel more confident in Uniswap’s ability to navigate potential legal obstacles. The surge in Ethereum (ETH) DEX volume has positioned Uniswap (UNI) as a leader in the DeFi space. Alongside Uniswap’s growth, Ethereum (ETH) itself has remained a dominant force, facilitating over $9.88 billion in DEX transactions, far outpacing other blockchains like Solana and Tron. As more innovative projects prepare for launch, Uniswap is expected to continue attracting significant trading volume, especially with projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) ready to launch. Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Investor Expectations Investors are already speculating that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could deliver massive returns. With its unique offering of decentralized gambling and the viral potential of meme coins, Mpeppe is positioned to become a standout project in the crypto space. Early investors are eyeing Uniswap (UNI) as the ideal platform for Mpeppe’s launch, given Uniswap’s large user base and liquidity. As Ethereum (ETH) remains the dominant blockchain for DeFi projects, Mpeppe’s decision to launch on Uniswap (UNI) aligns with its goal of capturing a broad audience. The project’s presale has already generated significant interest, and with Uniswap’s (UNI) increased volume, the launch is expected to attract even more attention. Conclusion As Uniswap (UNI) settles major regulatory charges and its transaction volume surges, the stage is set for new projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) to make a significant impact. Ethereum (ETH) continues to lead the DeFi space, and Uniswap’s (UNI) platform remains a critical hub for innovative decentralized applications. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its unique blend of meme coin culture and decentralized gambling, is preparing for a highly anticipated launch, with investors hoping to see substantial returns. The combination of Uniswap’s regulatory clarity, rising Ethereum DEX volume, and Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) innovative approach to GambleFi creates a promising outlook for this new project.

The restaking firm will also move into lending and borrowing markets.  TVL has increased on Ether.fi over the past month despite outflows across the sector.  Ether.fi said it selected the Scroll blockchain as a settlement layer, allowing the restaking protocol to start operating its planned credit card and introduce a market for lending and borrowing.  Scroll is a layer-2 blockchain that uses zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. Its mainnet started operating in October and has secured $676 million in total value locked (TVL), up from $556 million since Aug. 5, data from DefiLlama shows.  Ether.fi CEO Mike Silagadze told CoinDesk he believes the card, named ether.fi Cash, will bring ""billions in TVL"" to Scroll and make it the leading layer-2 network. The deal means cardholders will be able to use crypto as collateral and borrow against it for purchases before automatically paying the balance with native yields.  Transactions on the card will be ""gasless"" – meaning there will be no fee to pay – due to Scroll's zk-rollup technology, which drastically reduces costs when sending or staking assets. Data from Scrollscan shows that average gas fees are around 0.09 gwei ($0.005) compared with Ethereum's average of 32.8 gwei.  Ether.fi is one of the largest restaking protocols. It has $5.7 billion in TVL, an increase of 12% over the past month, which contrasts with the wider restaking sector. EigenLayer's TVL has dropped by $5 billion since July 30.  Restaking protocols are designed to give investors additional yield on top of the native yield native ether {{ETH}} staking provides. The entire market is worth around $24 billion.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/09/restaking-protocol-etherfi-selects-scroll-as-layer-2-network-for-settlement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a85ff88099f9966b83fdbb2756df2f3530868318-1509x849.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390379,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1LpB,1725886927,Ether.Fi to Launch Visa 'Cash' Card on Scroll Network,"Blockchain technology has been around for over a decade now, but it has arguably failed to find many mainstream use cases beyond speculative investment and simple peer-to-peer transactions.  Ether.fi, best known for its liquid restaking service, wants to change all that with a new blockchain-based credit card, Ether.fi Cash. It announced on Monday a plan to work with Scroll, a layer 2 network on Ethereum, to bring the credit card to market.  Ether.fi Cash would enable users to spend fiat while using their crypto assets as collateral, allowing people to hold onto crypto and earn yield while making everyday purchases. The card is currently in use internally at Ether.fi and will start shipping out to pre-order customers on Sept. 16.  Read more: Who Needs an Off-Ramp? Ether.fi Plans Visa Card for Crypto Investors  The partnership with Scroll aims to enhance cardholder transaction efficiency and provide a range of crypto-based rewards.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Sandy Peng, Scroll's co-founder, stressed that the network hosts one of the largest markets for the Aave lending platform: ""If you put 10 Ethereum into Aave and you use this credit card, then for you it's going to be the cheapest credit card in the world that you can find,"" she said.  According to a press release from Ether.fi, which has opened the card for pre-orders, Cash users will benefit from a 3% cash-back incentive on all transactions, without restrictions. The card, which will be issued as a physical Visa credit card, is designed to be compatible with mobile payment providers like Apple Pay.  “The first, probably 10 to 20,000 people, are going to be crypto 'degens,' like DeFi, crazy people,"" said Ether.fi co-founder Mike Silagadze. DeFi is short for ""decentralized finance"" and refers to blockchain-based tools for investing without middlemen.  Scroll operates a zero-knowledge rollup on top of the Ethereum blockchain—a kind of sister blockchain that allows users to transact cheaply.  As Cash’s settlement layer, Scroll will power Cash's DeFi lending and borrowing features, allowing users to leverage their crypto assets as collateral for purchases made using the card.  The companies told CoinDesk that Scroll was selected as the settlement layer for Ether.fi Cash in part because of its potential to reduce gas fees, making gasless transactions possible for Ether.fi Cash cardholders. According to Peng, Scroll's chain abstraction features – which will power the gasless transactions – will allow people to use Cash without paying mind to which particular blockchain they're using.  ""No one cares about what chain you're on, people just care about whether it's a good product,"" said Peng.  The card won't be available in the United States, at least for the time being – likely as a result of the decentralized finance industry's shaky regulatory standing in the country. The card will initially be available in Hong Kong, with other jurisdictions to be evaluated for launch at a later point. The ""tentative"" list of countries that will receive Ether.fi's new credit card includes the UK, UEA, Thailand, Brazil, Turkey, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Denmark, Estonia, Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic, Silagadze told CoinDesk.  Ether.fi Cash is not the crypto industry's first stab at creating a credit card, and previous efforts have failed to break through into the mainstream. Ether.fi and Scroll hope that things will be different this time around.  Silagadze's ultimate goal is to appeal to non-crypto users. ""There's just no other card that gives you 3% cash-back without crazy restrictions,"" he said.  ""I think it's the first time I've been able to get my friends who are outside of crypto interested"" in a crypto product, Peng added. ""It's genuinely a better credit card product"" rather than just ""a better crypto product.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | SPONSORED,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/09/etherfi-to-launch-visa-cash-card-on-scroll-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7359bc22608ce1cc19e01b61aca52fb3b25e875f-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Following a sharp decline, AVAX has surged more than 18% since hitting a low of $20.5 on September 6 and is now showing signs of strength as it flirts with higher prices. Related Reading: Can AVAX Reclaim $30? Top Analyst Predicts A Dip Before A Bounce This recovery has sparked optimism among top investors and analysts, many of whom are positioning themselves for the next potential rally. Analysts share their views on social media, suggesting that AVAX could soon target even higher levels, with an optimistic target above $28. This shift in sentiment marks a significant change from the previous bearish outlook as AVAX continues attracting attention from retail and institutional players. As the market evolves, all eyes are on Avalanche to see if it can maintain this bullish momentum and reach new price levels. Avalanche Showing Strength In Higher Time Frames Avalanche (AVAX) has been one of the most affected altcoins over the past few months, enduring a 73% decline from its March highs. Despite this significant drop, top analysts and investors are now predicting a reversal, with many expecting a swift recovery for this Layer-1 blockchain. One of the leading voices is Daan, a prominent crypto trader and investor, who recently shared his analysis of AVAX’s price structure on X. He highlighted that AVAX has established a higher low, which could signal the beginning of a bullish trend if it breaks past the key $28 resistance level. According to Daan’s analysis, this break would indicate a shift in market structure from bearish to bullish. If the price moves beyond $28, it could quickly target the low-$30 price range. Should AVAX reclaim these levels, investors could anticipate an aggressive upward move as demand builds, similar to the momentum seen in last year’s October-November surge. Daan also noted that such a move could lead to an influx of buyers, creating substantial demand that would further drive the price higher. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Rally Brewing? On-Chain Metrics Suggest Investors Optimism With growing optimism around AVAX, traders are watching closely for a potential breakout. Many see the $28 level as the critical point determining whether AVAX can sustain this upward momentum and potentially initiate a new rally. AVAX Price Action AVAX trades at $23.82, following an 18% surge from local lows. The price has recently moved above the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $23.23, a critical strength indicator in shorter time frames. A sustained uptrend could form in the short term when the price is above this level and maintained as support. This shift has sparked renewed optimism among traders and investors. For bulls to maintain control and continue pushing AVAX higher, the price must break past the local high of $28.01. A successful move above this resistance could lead to further upward momentum, potentially targeting higher price ranges in the days ahead. However, if AVAX fails to break above this key resistance level, the price may face a pullback, likely retesting the lower demand zone near $20, which has served as strong support during recent corrections.

While the event shook the Toncoin (TON) ecosystem, another meme cryptocurrency, Mpeppe (MPEPE), managed to capitalize on the situation. Let’s dive into the aftermath of this incident and how Mpeppe (MPEPE) has gained traction. Telegram CEO’s Arrest Sends Shockwaves Through the Toncoin (TON) Ecosystem The arrest of Telegram’s CEO Pavel Durov sent Toncoin (TON) investors into a state of uncertainty. As a project closely associated with Telegram, Toncoin (TON) faced backlash from investors who feared the impact this event could have on its long-term viability. The arrest led to a 10% drop in TON’s value, which raised concerns about the future of the network. Toncoin’s Struggles Lead to Investor Exodus With growing concerns about Toncoin (TON), many investors started diversifying their portfolios, moving away from Toncoin (TON) to avoid potential long-term risks. As they sought alternatives, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stood out as an attractive option, particularly for those seeking decentralized, community-driven projects. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Benefited from Toncoin’s Struggles While Toncoin (TON) was hit hard by its connection to Telegram, Mpeppe (MPEPE) thrived in a decentralized environment. As a meme cryptocurrency not reliant on any single entity, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presented itself as a more stable investment during uncertain times. This difference in structure between the two projects was a major factor in Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rise. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Decentralized Meme Coin with Utility Unlike Toncoin (TON), which is closely tied to Telegram, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a fully decentralized meme coin with real-world utility. It leverages decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, offering features like yield farming, liquidity mining, and governance mechanisms. These functionalities have given Mpeppe (MPEPE) a competitive edge in the market. Toncoin’s Centralization Concerns Versus Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Community-Driven Approach One of the key issues raised after the Toncoin (TON) debacle was its connection to Telegram and its leadership. Investors began to see the risks associated with centralized projects, and Mpeppe (MPEPE), being community-driven, offered a more appealing alternative. This decentralized governance helped reassure investors seeking more transparent and secure opportunities in the crypto space. Conclusion: Will Mpeppe (MPEPE) Continue to Dominate? As the cryptocurrency market adjusts to the fallout from Telegram’s CEO’s arrest, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a surprising beneficiary. While Toncoin (TON) grapples with its challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE)‘s decentralized approach, community-driven focus, and expanding use cases make it a project to watch closely. Investors looking for a stable and promising meme coin in the wake of Toncoin (TON)’s struggles may find Mpeppe (MPEPE) to be the perfect fit.

33380070,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640681,1725886815,$120M Trading Volume Hits Starknet As New Ethereum Cryptocurrencies STRK & Mpeppe Generate Profits,"The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, and two projects making headlines are Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both projects have caught the attention of traders and investors, especially after the recent surge in trading volume that hit the Starknet (STRK) ecosystem. With over $120 million in trading activity, Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe have become focal points for Ethereum investors looking for gains in an otherwise bearish market. Starknet’s Recent Performance: A Major Gainer in September Starknet (STRK) has been one of the standout performers in the first week of September 2024. The Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution saw its token rise by 7% recently, continuing its upward trajectory with a cumulative 19% increase over the past week. Starknet (STRK) utilizes zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-STARKs) to improve Ethereum’s scalability, allowing the network to handle more transactions at lower costs while maintaining security. A key development that sparked interest in Starknet (STRK) was Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s move to transfer over 2 million STRK tokens to a new wallet. This action drew significant market attention, pushing STRK to trade at $0.43 after briefly dipping to $0.39. The transfer reinforced Starknet (STRK)’s position as a promising Ethereum-based solution, reigniting investor confidence in the project. From a technical standpoint, Starknet (STRK)’s recent price movements have been supported by bullish indicators. The Bull Bear Power (BBP) metric shows that buying pressure has once again overtaken selling pressure, indicating the possibility of further gains. Additionally, Starknet (STRK) has broken above a descending trendline, suggesting that its bullish momentum could continue. If sustained, Starknet (STRK) could see its price climb to $0.48, according to market analysts. However, it faces a key support level at $0.35, and a drop below this threshold could result in a more significant decline. Mpeppe: The Rising Star of Decentralized Casinos While Starknet (STRK) is gaining traction in the Ethereum scaling space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing attention in the meme coin and decentralized finance sectors, particularly through its innovative online casino platform. Built on Ethereum, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers more than just speculative trading its decentralized casino platform provides real utility, allowing users to participate in provably fair gaming while earning staking rewards. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s decentralized casino operates with the transparency and security that blockchain technology provides, offering a unique proposition in the rapidly growing GambleFi space. Investors are not only attracted by the token’s meme coin appeal but also by the promise of long-term profitability through the platform’s revenue-sharing model. With its presale already nearing completion, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is set to launch its casino platform soon, giving token holders the opportunity to earn passive income through staking and profit-sharing mechanisms. The excitement surrounding the project has led to significant buy-in from Ethereum (ETH) whale investors, positioning Mpeppe (MPEPE) as one of the most promising projects in the decentralized casino sector. Ethereum Investors Eye Profits in Starknet and Mpeppe Ethereum (ETH) whale investors are taking advantage of the opportunities presented by both Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). With Starknet (STRK)’s advanced layer-2 scaling capabilities and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s decentralized casino platform, both projects are seen as high-potential investments in the current market. The recent surge in Starknet (STRK)’s trading volume is a clear indication that investors are beginning to take notice of the project’s long-term potential. Similarly, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach to decentralized gambling has attracted attention from those looking for real utility in the meme coin space. Both Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) (MPEPE) have distinct value propositions that set them apart in the crowded crypto market. Starknet (STRK) is providing a much-needed solution to Ethereum’s scalability issues, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) is bringing a new dimension to the online gambling industry with its decentralized, transparent platform. As a result, both projects are becoming popular choices for Ethereum investors seeking to diversify their portfolios. Conclusion: Starknet and Mpeppe Leading the Charge As the broader cryptocurrency market remains relatively quiet, Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are emerging as top contenders for Ethereum investors. Starknet’s layer-2 scaling solution has demonstrated strong technical performance, supported by bullish indicators and increased trading volume. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s decentralized casino platform offers real-world utility in the rapidly growing GambleFi sector, making it a standout in the meme coin space.

Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon are reportedly playing with the idea of integrating Dogecoin (DOGE) into Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite project, a move that could catapult the meme coin to new heights. But as Mpeppe (MPEPE) rapidly gains traction with its decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities, will it too be added to the mix? Let’s dive into the details. Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon Eye Dogecoin (DOGE) for Starlink Payments Rumors have surfaced that tech titans Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon are exploring the possibility of accepting Dogecoin (DOGE) as a payment method for Starlink services. This move could add significant utility to the meme coin, cementing its position as more than just a speculative asset. The integration of Dogecoin (DOGE) into these companies’ ecosystems would give the cryptocurrency a major boost, further solidifying its use case in mainstream applications. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Growing Popularity: Will It Follow in Dogecoin (DOGE)’s Footsteps? While Dogecoin (DOGE) is enjoying the spotlight, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not far behind. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) gains recognition for its strong DeFi integration, many wonder if it will soon be considered for similar collaborations. By providing access to a wide range of financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers significant value to its holders. Could this utility propel Mpeppe (MPEPE) into the same category as DOGE in terms of mass adoption? Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s DeFi Integration: The Key to Future Tech Collaborations? One of the major differentiators between Mpeppe (MPEPE) and other meme coins is its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi). By facilitating financial services without the need for traditional intermediaries, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a valuable player in the crypto space. This functionality not only enhances the token’s utility but also makes it an attractive option for potential partnerships with tech companies looking to incorporate decentralized payment solutions. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s Potential Role in the Starlink Project: What It Means for Meme Coins The use of Dogecoin (DOGE) in Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite project could have far-reaching implications for the meme coin ecosystem. If major companies like Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon adopt DOGE for payments, it could pave the way for other meme coins, such as Mpeppe (MPEPE), to gain similar traction. This would mark a significant step toward legitimizing meme coins as viable digital currencies for mainstream use. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Next Big Thing in Crypto? While Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the king of meme coins, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a serious contender. Its blend of DeFi functionality and meme culture has caught the attention of the crypto community. The token’s ability to offer services such as yield farming and liquidity mining makes it more than just a fun cryptocurrency – it’s a real player in the DeFi space. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to grow, it may soon attract the attention of tech giants looking for new blockchain-based payment solutions. Conclusion: Could Mpeppe (MPEPE) Join Dogecoin (DOGE) in the Mainstream? As Dogecoin (DOGE) potentially prepares for a significant leap in utility through its collaboration with Starlink, the future looks bright for meme coins. However, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is proving that it, too, is a force to be reckoned with. With its strong DeFi integration, decentralized governance, and dedicated community, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has the potential to rival DOGE in the coming years.

While many altcoins struggle with bearish market conditions, these two projects have shown promising gains, making them attractive options for long-term investments. Starknet has recently seen a 13% surge in its price, while Mpeppe is making waves in the decentralized online gambling sector. Starknet: Poised for Growth Starknet (STRK) has emerged as one of the top-performing Ethereum (ETH) layer 2 solutions in recent months. Designed to solve Ethereum (ETH)’s scalability issues, Starknet uses cutting-edge technology to handle a high volume of transactions while keeping costs low. The project utilizes Zero-Knowledge Rollup (ZK-STARKs) technology to verify data without revealing sensitive information, making it a favorite among developers looking to scale their decentralized applications (dApps). Recently, Starknet (STRK) experienced a 13% price increase, bringing new enthusiasm to its community. The current price of STRK hovers around $0.43, a significant drop from its all-time high of $3.66. However, many investors believe that Starknet has found solid support around the $0.32-$0.35 range, setting the stage for a potential recovery. Analysts point to several reasons for the renewed interest in Starknet (STRK). One of the major catalysts for its recent price surge is the project’s latest upgrade, which allows for parallel transaction processing. This upgrade has reduced transaction costs by 66% and shortened confirmation times to just two seconds, making it one of the most efficient layer 2 solutions available today. Additionally, Starknet has introduced new DAO functionalities, adding further value to its ecosystem. Another key development is the introduction of the first NFT lending and borrowing protocol on the Starknet (STRK) network.

This decline, however, also pushed the price below the crucial low of $56,711 that was similarly seen on May 1st , a level that has previously triggered swift recoveries. The sell-off has resulted, not surprisingly, in a reduction of leveraged positions, indicating a market potentially nearing a local bottom. However, we believe US equity markets, particularly the S&P 500 – which last week saw its worst weekly performance since March 2023 – is critical to Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Correlations between Bitcoin prices and traditional financial markets persist , with significant spot ETF outflows in the past week suggesting that traditional finance investors are de-risking from cryptocurrencies. Notably, since August 27th, there have been $706.1 million in net outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, and a downtrend in aggregated spot Cumulative Volume Delta, indicating aggressive spot selling . In contrast, altcoin markets have shown resilience . As the sell-off took hold last week Bitcoin dominance , which measures the market capitalisation of BTC against the rest of the crypto market decreased by 1.3 percent. In comparison, the market cap of all other crypto assets, (excluding the top 10) increased by 4.4 percent. Dare we say it, but the shift hints at a potential regime change where investors are exploring value in altcoins, diverging from the typical pattern of flocking to Bitcoin during downturns. Altcoin open interest, however, has also dropped by 55 percent from its all-time high, indicating speculative apathy and potential exhaustion among sellers. The ETH/BTC ratio , as a proxy for the altcoin market, remains under its 365-day Simple Moving Average, reflecting the broader underperformance of ETH since the Merge . However, if Bitcoin dominance has indeed reached a local top, we may see a period of altcoin outperformance in the coming months, potentially setting the stage for a bullish Q4 should macroeconomic pressures ease. The main catalyst for the sell off last week was arguably the US labour market report for August displaying only modest growth. However, we see this as offering the Federal Reserve some reassurance as they prepare for a shift towards lowering interest rates. Employment figures rose less than anticipated, but the unemployment rate dipped to 4.2 percent from 4.3 percent in July. In the manufacturing sector, evidence of continued contraction for the fifth consecutive month emerged . Driven by weak demand, this is further evidence to support a lowering of rates. Companies are cutting back on production to protect profit margins, mirroring broader slowdowns in economic activity. The construction sector, too, is showing signs of strain. The US Commerce Department’s Census Bureau reported a 0.3 percent decline in construction spending in July, following no change in June. This decline was worse than expected, reflecting the broader slowdown in the housing market as reduced affordability and the fading of the pandemic-era housing boom impacts sales. Houses are staying on the market longer, and builders are exercising caution in starting new projects due to increased inventory and weaker demand. Overall, while certain sectors are seeing slight improvements, others are grappling with reduced activity. In crypto news last week, Japan’s three megabanks—MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho—are launching “ Project Pax ,” a pilot program using blockchain-based stablecoins to streamline cross-border settlements, and are aiming for commercial rollout by 2025. The project will integrate SWIFT’s API framework for compliance and efficiency. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve has issued a cease-and-desist order on United Texas Bank due to shortcomings it has found in its risk management and anti-money laundering practices regarding its crypto clients. It has ordered the bank to improve its oversight and customer due diligence procedures. Have a great trading week!

42390395,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1N47,1725883260,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Reclaims $55K Ahead of Tuesday's Harris-Trump Debate,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: $1,774.87 +1%  Bitcoin (BTC): $55,372.84 +1.4%  Ether (ETH): $2,319.53 +0.63%  S&P 500: 5,408.42 −1.73%  Gold: $2,494.24 −0.11%  Nikkei 225: 36,215.75 −0.48%  Top Stories  Bitcoin nudged above $55,000 during the European morning after holding between $54,000 and $55,000 over the weekend. It has added 1.45% in the last 24 hours while the broader crypto market has risen 1.15%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. This week, traders will be eyeing the U.S. release of August's CPI and PPI data on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. Before then, on Tuesday, Donald Trump goes head to head with Kamala Harris in the first debate between the presidential candidates ahead of November's election. Trump has said he aims to make the U.S. the “crypto capital” of the world, and Harris aides are also reportedly considering policies to bolster the industry.  A Trump victory in November could see bitcoin surge to an all-time high of $90,000, broker Bernstein said in a research report. A Harris victory, on the other hand, could see it test the $30,000-$40,000 range. Bernstein noted Trump's vocal support for BTC, wishing to make the U.S. the ""bitcoin and crypto capital of the world,"" and having mentioned cryptocurrency in every policy speech he has made. ""After the last three years of regulatory purge, a positive crypto regulatory policy can spur innovation again and bring the users back to financial products on the blockchain,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. ""Elections remain hard to call, but if you are long crypto here, you are likely taking a Trump trade,"" the report added.  BTC is ""grossly undervalued,"" due to the market overlooking Bitcoin's network security, according to trading firm Presto Research. Bitcoin's hashrate, a measure of the computational power that secures the network, has hit an all-time high of 679 EH/s, the firm said in a note. “If you believe that trend will continue (in fact, the availability of spot ETF means we are in a much better setup than ever before), BTC seems grossly undervalued at the moment,” analysts Peter Chung and Min Jung said. Bitcoin miners are expanding their capacity again since August amid all-time highs in hashrate, which has typically marked price bottoms for the asset. Elsewhere, some traders said lower-than-expected U.S. payroll figures indicated a weaker labor market, while the lower unemployment figure has lessened the concerns of an imminent recession.  Chart of the Day  The FedWatch tool uses prices for the fed funds futures to predict the size of Fed interest-rate cuts on Sept. 18.  Traders currently assign less than a 30% probability to the Fed cutting rates by 50 basis points next week.

33378138,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640661,1725881428,FET Teeters At Trendline: Will A Breakout Fuel A Run To $1.86?,"Fetch.ai (FET) is at a critical crossroads as it tests a key bearish trendline. While the cryptocurrency has struggled against the trendline, signs of emerging bullish sentiment are fueling optimism for a potential breakout. As FET balances on this trendline, a strong move above it could open the door for a rally toward the $1.86 mark. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate FET’s current price action as it hovers near a crucial bearish trendline. By examining key technical indicators and market sentiment, we seek to determine whether FET has the potential to break through resistance and ignite a rally toward the $1.86 level, or if the bears will continue to dominate, keeping the price subdued. At the time of writing, FET was trading around $1.11, showing a 3.22% increase. FET boasts a market capitalization of over $2.8 billion and a trading volume of $116 million. In the past 24 hours, its market cap and trading volume have increased by 3.39% and 23.95%, respectively. Analyzing FET’s Current Price Action On the 4-hour chart, despite trading below the 100-day SMA, FET is showing promising momentum, attempting to move above the trendline. The appearance of multiple bullish candlesticks indicates strong buying interest and positive market sentiment, suggesting that a breakout could be imminent. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the same timeframe has moved above the 50% mark and is currently at 56%. This rise indicates that bullish momentum is building, potentially signaling a forthcoming breakout above the bearish trendline. Related Reading: FET Surges 12% Ahead Of ASI Token Merger Phase 2, Can It Hit $5? Also, on the 1-day chart, FET is gaining upward momentum as it targets a breakout above the bearish trendline, aiming to reach the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This movement suggests a positive market sentiment, with buyers potentially driving the price higher if a breakout occurs. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI signal has risen to 52% above the 50% threshold after briefly dropping to 47%. Particularly, this rebound suggests positive momentum is gaining strength, which could push the cryptocurrency higher. FET Next Big Move – Rally Or Retreat? With recent upward momentum and the RSI indicating optimistic signals, FET could be set for a substantial rally toward the $1.86 resistance level if it successfully breaks through the bearish trendline. A breach of this level might lead to further gains, possibly triggering the price to test the $2.56 resistance and even reach higher resistance zones. Related Reading: FET: On-Chain Development Fuels 44% Surge In Just A Week If the trendline remains intact and bearish pressure continues, FET may face a decline toward the previous support level at $0.96. Furthermore, a break below this support could lead to an additional downtrend, potentially causing the price to fall to $0.45 or even lower.

42390378,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1Lk3,1725880913,"A 0.50% Fed Rate Cut Could Raise Alarm for Bitcoin, 10X Research Warns","An aggressive Fed rate cut may signal economic worry, not reassurance, weighing over risk assets, including bitcoin, according to 10x Research.  Traders currently see a less than 30% chance of a 50 basis point rate cut next week.  Friday's U.S. jobs report has seemingly set the stage for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to start cutting interest rates, with the first move likely to happen next week.  The supposedly bullish liquidity easing cycle may klick off on a sour note for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, if the Fed cuts rates by 50 basis points (bps) on Sept. 18, according to 10x Research.  Latest News: Odds of 50 Basis Point Fed Rate Cut Next Week Jump to 45%  Rate moves are expressed in “basis points (bps),” equal to 1/100 of a percentage point and central banks, including the Fed, typically opt for 25 basis point interest rate changes. However, more significant moves are occasionally chosen, indicating a sense of urgency. For instance, the Fed delivered multiple 50 bps and 75 bps hikes during the 2022 tightening cycle, signaling an urgency to control inflation and causing risk aversion in financial markets.  A 50 basis point rate cut next week might imply heightened economic concerns or a sense of falling behind the curve in combating the impending economic slowdown, thus leading investors to scale back exposure to risk assets like bitcoin {{BTC}} and stocks.  ""While a 50 basis point cut by the Fed might signal deeper concerns to the markets, the Fed's primary focus will be mitigating economic risks rather than managing market reactions,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients Monday, having correctly predicted BTC's first quarter rally to $70,000.  At press time, Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) FedWatch tool showed almost 30% probability that the Fed will cut rates by 50 basis points to the 4.75%-5% range next week.  ""The probability of a 50 basis point cut is only 29%, contrasting our view and the prevailing consensus. The chorus is growing louder that the Fed is behind the curve, having missed signs of labor market weakness after being caught off guard in July,"" Thielen added.  Thielen's view is consistent with the consensus among traditional market experts.  ""The Fed doesn't want to start with a 50bps cut because frankly, at this point, the economy doesn't need them to panic,"" macro trader Craig Shapiro said on X.  Shapiro detailed that liquidity-addicted markets will want the Fed to start with a 50 bps rate cut and will correct lower until the central bank opts for bigger reductions.  ""We are back in this zone. Risk assets will correct until the Fed capitulates and gives it what it wants. We need to find the Fed put strike price, but given where the economy is now and with risk asset prices (stocks, credit spreads, etc) still so elevated while the economic data is still slowly growing, I fear the levels are significantly lower,"" Shapiro added.  Past data show the start of the rate-cutting cycle, irrespective of the size of the first move, does not always have a stimulative effect on asset prices.  Note that the expected Fed easing has been one of the key factors behind BTC's uptrend from $20,000 in January 2023, which raises the question of whether the rate cut is already priced in.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/09/a-050-fed-rate-cut-could-raise-alarm-for-bitcoin-10x-research-warns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2034815be0f5ade3e4e59c590590ce2e58cd4de-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Her resignation is the latest in a series of senior management departures at the crypto payments firm.  BCB Group, the London-based crypto payments firm, is about to suffer its fifth C-suite departure in 18 months with the loss of its chief compliance officer, Natasha Powell.  ""I am stepping away from the day to day running of the business,"" Powell said in an email, who declined to identify her new position saying simply that it wasn't a competitor. Kym Routledge will head up the compliance function following her departure.  ""Natasha has been instrumental in driving the creation of BCB Group's first class compliance programme that now forms the bedrock of our regulated businesses,"" CEO Oliver Tonkin said in an emailed statement. ""Whilst I am sad to see her leave us, I am delighted to be able to announce she will be continuing to support BCB as a non-executive director of BCB Payments.""  Powell's departure follows that of the company's former CEO, Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, who left the firm in November to pursue new opportunities. His exit came just five months after Deputy CEO Noah Sharp left following the failed acquisition of Germany's Sutor Bank. The chief banking officer, Ian Moore, quit the payments firm in September last year, and Lux Thiagarajah, BCB's former chief revenue officer, joined crypto prime broker FalconX in May as head of commercial FX.  The payments processor recently received a takeover approach from an unidentified investor, CoinDesk revealed last week. The buyout interest was initiated by the potential acquirer while BCB was exploring a Series B funding round, according to people familiar with the matter.

33376198,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640645,1725876028,"Bitcoin Rainbow Chart Forecasts An End To Bearish Headwinds With $60,000+ Target","Crypto analyst Daan Crypto has highlighted a Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, which has provided insights into the crypto’s current price action. The analyst also suggested that Bitcoin needs to hold above $60,000 to make a bullish reversal. Bitcoin Needs To Break Above $60,000 In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Daan Crypto suggested that Bitcoin needs to break above $60,000 to enjoy a bullish reversal and possibly reach new highs in this market cycle. The crypto analyst noted that Bitcoin was still trading in the dark green region on the accompanying Rainbow chart as it struggles to hold on to the $60,000 range. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Extended Consolidation Or A Break Below/Above? Meanwhile, as Bitcoin struggles to break above $60,000, Daan Crypto raised the possibility of the leading crypto dropping below $51,000, the blue area on the Rainbow chart. The crypto analyst suggested it would present an excellent buying opportunity, stating that the blue area has historically been a good accumulation area in higher timeframes. Bitcoin’s price action has remained tepid since hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,000 in March earlier this year. This has raised concerns that the bull market might be over and that the crypto market is slowly entering a bear market. However, Daan Crypto has provided some reassurance that the best is still yet to come for Bitcoin. In another X post, the crypto analyst stated that he doesn’t feel like the past six months are that odd despite Bitcoin’s price action. He noted that this cycle is like no other, as he provided insights into a plausible reason why the leading crypto’s price has remained stagnant since March. Bitcoin hit a new ATH before the halving event in April, which has never happened before. In line with this, Daan Crypto stated that Bitcoin is technically still ahead of where it would have been in previous cycles. This suggests that the crypto has stalled to consolidate and resynchronize with previous halving cycles. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital once echoed a similar sentiment while warning that Bitcoin’s failure to consolidate would lead to an accelerated cycle. More Liquidity Will Soon Flow Into BTC Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of the BitMEX crypto exchange, recently stated that he anticipates more liquidity to flow into Bitcoin. As such, he predicts that Bitcoin “might” rise if things continue to play out the way he expects. Hayes’ bullish prediction stems from his outlook on the macroeconomic side. Related Reading: XRP Price To $100: Why Has It Not Hit This Price Yet? He noted that Janet Yellen, the US Treasury Secretary, released a statement over the weekend in which she maintained that the US economy is heading towards a soft landing despite the recent weak job reports. Therefore, the crypto market is expected to recover if Yellen and the US Federal Reserve work towards quantitative easing (QE). At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $54,800, up over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Snapshot X, the new governance protocol, makes use of storage proofs – a cryptographic feature that StarkWare, the primary developer of Starknet, has helped to innovate. The technology allows users to prove that assets exist on one blockchain, without needing to use a third party to move them to another.  “By mathematically verifying data across chains, storage proofs eliminate the need for third-party intermediaries, making the process more secure and cost-efficient,” StarkWare wrote in a press release shared with CoinDesk. “For Snapshot X, this means users can vote based on assets held on one chain, while conducting governance on another, without transferring tokens or paying gas fees.”  Snapshot Labs COO Jeremy Musighi told CoinDesk in a message over Telegram that when a user casts a vote on the platform, a proof of their holdings is sent to the layer-1 blockchain.  ""On the contract side, Snapshot X verifies this proof,” he said. “Once verified, we can be certain that the user indeed has the balance he claims to have on L1.”  The first vote on Snapshot X, scheduled to take place this week, pertains to a proposal regarding Starknet itself. Community members of Starknet are being asked to decide on the minting mechanism for the project’s new staking proposal.  “From tomorrow, Sept. 10, until Sept. 13, STRK token holders will vote on a staking proposal through the Starknet Governance Hub, a custom-built interface for Snapshot X,” StarkWare wrote.

The breach in July resulted in the loss of over $100 million in SHIB, $52 million in ETH, and other assets, representing a significant portion of WazirX's reserves, with ongoing efforts to manage the fallout through restructuring.  The North Korean entity behind India’s biggest crypto hack moved $11 million in stolen ether (ETH) early Monday in the latest batch of transfers to mixing service Tornado Cash.  Wallet data tracked by Arkham shows over 5,000 ETH, worth just over $11 million at current prices, from July’s attack on crypto exchange WazirX was moved to a new address at 07:19 UTC.  Then, $1.2 million in tokens from that address were sent to Tornado Cash over five different transfers.  Tornado Cash allows crypto users to exchange tokens while masking wallet addresses on various blockchains. The service, by itself, is not nefarious but is commonly used by crypto criminals to clean an online trail that could lead to the identity of those moving stolen funds.  The moves follow a $4 million transfer from last week, as first reported by CoinDesk. The hacker’s main address holds over $107 million worth of various tokens - with a majority in ether at $100 million.  In July, WazirX was hit by a security breach in one of its multisig wallets, causing over $100 million in shiba inu (SHIB) and $52 million in ether, among other assets, to be drained from the exchange.  The stolen funds accounted for over 45% of the total reserves cited by the exchange in a June 2024 report – and the exchange has since filed for a restructuring process to clear liabilities.",NEGATIVE,ETH | SHIB,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SHIB | ARKM,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/09/wazirx-hacker-moves-11m-stolen-ether-to-tornado-cash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8e0c7749afacc68b95131f116f3c7f4f4cbbf91-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33375067,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640659,1725872692,Helium (HNT) Latest News: Here’s Why These 2 Crypto Coins Have Rally During Bearish Sentiment,"As the broader cryptocurrency market faces bearish sentiment, Helium (HNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have defied the trend, experiencing impressive rallies. While Helium (HNT) continues to make strides in the decentralized wireless network space, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s meme-powered gambling platform has captured the attention of investors. Here’s why these two cryptocurrencies are outperforming the market during these challenging times. Helium’s (HNT) Decentralized Network Expansion Fuels Growth Helium (HNT)’s innovative approach to building decentralized wireless networks has allowed it to stand out during the bear market. Helium (HNT) is leveraging IoT (Internet of Things) infrastructure, providing cost-effective and efficient wireless coverage by incentivizing users to run hotspots. This decentralized network model is appealing to users and businesses alike, driving demand for HNT tokens and fueling its recent rally. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Attracts Investors With Its Unique Gambling Utility While Helium (HNT) is focused on IoT, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is taking a different approach by combining the meme coin culture with online gambling and decentralized finance (De-Fi). Mpeppe (MPEPE) has gained traction as investors seek excitement and potential high returns, making it one of the fastest-growing meme coins despite market headwinds. Meme Coins and Gambling: A Perfect Match for Risk-Takers Meme coins like Mpeppe (MPEPE) have introduced an element of excitement to the world of online gambling. Mpeppe (MPEPE) leverages its playful branding and viral nature to attract users looking for high-risk, high-reward experiences. The speculative nature of meme coins, combined with their extreme volatility, mirrors the thrill of gambling, creating a perfect synergy between the two. Viral Influence Drives Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Buzz The viral nature of Mpeppe (MPEPE) has played a significant role in its adoption. Like other successful meme coins, MPEPE taps into internet culture and memes to create a buzz across social media platforms. This viral influence drives investment and creates a sense of community around the project, allowing MPEPE to thrive during bearish market conditions. Instant Rewards in Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Casino Ecosystem One of the key factors behind Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s growing popularity is its ability to deliver instant rewards to users through its casino platform. By utilizing Mpeppe (MPEPE) and other cryptocurrencies, the platform offers an enhanced gaming experience with timely payouts. This immediate gratification is attractive to both gamers and investors, adding to the coin’s momentum. Helium’s (HNT) Real-World Utility Unlike many speculative cryptocurrencies, Helium (HNT) boasts real-world utility through its decentralized wireless network. Helium (HNT) allows users to earn Helium (HNT) by providing network coverage via their hotspots, offering a practical use case that continues to drive demand even in a bearish market. As businesses adopt Helium (HNT)’s network for IoT devices, HNT sees increased utility, which has contributed to its recent rally. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Potential for 100x Growth While Helium (HNT) focuses on infrastructure, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has captured investor interest with its potential for massive returns. With its strong community support and the integration of gambling and De-Fi, MPEPE is being seen as a possible 100x growth coin. The high-risk, high-reward nature of MPEPE is drawing investors looking for exponential gains, even in a challenging market. Conclusion: HNT and MPEPE Leading the Pack Despite the broader bearish sentiment, Helium (HNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are defying expectations by continuing to grow. Helium (HNT) provides real-world IoT solutions, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) is revolutionizing the meme coin space with its integration of gambling and De-Fi. As investors seek out projects with staying power, both Helium (HNT) and MPEPE are emerging as top picks for those looking to weather the storm and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.

33375021,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640654,1725872497,Why This Helium (HNT) Millionaire Has Allocated All His Gains To This New Casino Crypto Coin Skyrocketing 150%,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors are always on the lookout for the next big thing. Recently, a Helium (HNT) millionaire made headlines by shifting all his gains into the rising star of the casino crypto space—Mpeppe (MPEPE). This move has caught the attention of both the Helium (HNT) and broader crypto community as Mpeppe (MPEPE) skyrocketed 150%. Let’s explore why this transition is happening and what makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) the next big thing in online gambling. Helium’s (HNT) Success Lays the Foundation The Helium (HNT) millionaire has already proven his ability to identify profitable projects. Helium (HNT), known for its decentralized wireless network powered by IoT, has grown significantly, rewarding its early investors handsomely. By leveraging its innovative model of providing cost-efficient, decentralized network coverage through user-run hotspots, Helium (HNT) attracted a vast user base, making it one of the top-performing tokens. The Casino Revolution: Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is Grabbing Attention Unlike Helium (HNT), Mpeppe (MPEPE) is blazing a new trail in the world of online gambling and decentralized finance. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has built a strong case for itself as a meme cryptocurrency that merges the fun of viral internet culture with the lucrative online casino industry. By offering a decentralized gambling platform with integrated De-Fi features, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides a completely new experience for players and investors alike. A Major Draw for Casino Players One of the core reasons why the Helium (HNT) millionaire shifted his gains to Mpeppe (MPEPE) is the platform’s enhanced security and privacy. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency transactions appeals to online gamblers who value privacy. With blockchain technology ensuring anonymity and secure transactions, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has created a seamless environment that overcomes traditional security concerns in gambling. Breaking Down Barriers with Mpeppe (MPEPE) For global gamblers, Mpeppe (MPEPE) eliminates geographical limitations and currency exchange issues. Cryptocurrencies like MPEPE facilitate borderless transactions, empowering players from all over the world to participate in online gambling without the hassles of traditional banking systems. This accessibility is driving adoption, making Mpeppe (MPEPE) an attractive choice for both gamblers and investors. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Low-Cost Transactions Provide A Competitive Edge Unlike Helium (HNT), which focuses on providing decentralized wireless networks, Mpeppe (MPEPE) uses blockchain to significantly reduce transaction costs within its gambling platform. Blockchain technology processes transactions swiftly, minimizing delays and reducing fees for players. These savings not only benefit players but also increase the platform’s profitability, making it a win-win for everyone involved. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is the Next Big Thing in Crypto Gambling While Helium (HNT) has enjoyed massive success, the shift towards Mpeppe (MPEPE) signals a new chapter in crypto investing. With its decentralized, secure, and transparent platform, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to become a major player in the online casino space. As more investors follow in the footsteps of the Helium (HNT) millionaire, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioned for even greater success.

However, even with this impressive rise, the spotlight remains on Mpeppe (MPEPE), the meme coin that has captured the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. With recent ecosystem enhancements, Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to hold its position as a market favorite. Let’s dive into what’s driving these two projects forward and why Mpeppe (MPEPE) remains the top pick for many crypto enthusiasts. Helium’s (HNT) Network Expansion Spurs Price Increase Helium (HNT), known for its decentralized wireless infrastructure, has seen significant growth thanks to ongoing network expansion. The latest updates in its infrastructure have contributed to a 16% price increase, signaling investor confidence in the project. As Helium (HNT) builds out its global network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, more investors are flocking to the token, anticipating long-term growth potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Continues to Dominate the Market While Helium (HNT) is making waves in the IoT sector, Mpeppe (MPEPE) remains the market favorite thanks to its unique blend of meme culture, gaming, and decentralized finance (De-Fi). Following recent enhancements to its ecosystem, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has solidified its place as a dominant player in the meme coin market. Its ability to merge viral appeal with real utility has made it a standout among its competitors. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Ecosystem Enhancements Fuel Growth One of the key reasons for Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s continued success is its ecosystem enhancements. By integrating features like yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides a comprehensive De-Fi platform that goes beyond the typical meme coin offering. These enhancements have added significant value to the Mpeppe (MPEPE) community, attracting a diverse range of investors who are looking for more than just short-term gains. Helium’s IoT Focus vs. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Meme Culture Although Helium (HNT) has carved out a niche in the IoT sector, it lacks the viral appeal that has fueled Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rapid rise. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s ability to tap into meme culture, combined with its real-world utility in gaming and sports betting, has given it a unique position in the market. While Helium (HNT) appeals to more technically-minded investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s wide-ranging ecosystem makes it accessible and attractive to a broader audience. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Gaming and Betting Platform Draws Investors One of the standout features of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its gaming and sports betting platform. This ecosystem allows users to trade the community token, engage in sports-related activities, and earn rewards through various De-Fi mechanisms. This gamified approach has proven to be highly appealing to a younger, more tech-savvy demographic, driving demand for the token and contributing to its status as a market favorite. Conclusion: Helium vs. Mpeppe (MPEPE) – Which Token Will Prevail? While Helium (HNT) has shown impressive resilience with its 16% rally, Mpeppe (MPEPE) remains the clear market favorite. The meme coin’s ability to integrate De-Fi, gaming, and viral marketing has set it apart from its competitors, making it a must-have in the portfolios of both short-term and long-term investors. Helium (HNT)’s long-term potential in the IoT sector cannot be overlooked, but for those looking for immediate growth and excitement, Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to shine.

Bernstein said a Harris election win could see the crypto fall to as low as $30,000.  Positive crypto regulatory policy could spur innovation and increase adoption, the report said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is expected to reach new highs later this year if Donald Trump wins the U.S. election in November, and the cryptocurrency could hit $90,000 by the fourth quarter, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Monday.  If Kamala Harris wins the election, the largest crypto by market cap is expected to break its current floor around the $50,000 level and could test the $30,000-$40,000 range, the report said.  The broker noted that Trump has been very vocal about making America the ""bitcoin and crypto capital of the world,"" and has mentioned digital assets at every policy speech he has made.  Trump's speech at the Bitcoin Nashville conference in July called for the U.S. to be a bitcoin mining powerhouse, for the appointment of a crypto friendly Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, the formation of a national strategic bitcoin stockpile and a crypto advisory council to the President.  Conversely, crypto has not even been mentioned in any of Harris's speeches, the report noted.  Bernstein said the crypto market has been faced with two significant headwinds for the past three years, macro and regulatory.  ""After the last three years of regulatory purge, a positive crypto regulatory policy can spur innovation again and bring the users back to financial products on the blockchain,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

Mpeppe (MPEPE), BRETT or PEPE","The meme coin market is more competitive than ever, with top contenders like Mpeppe (MPEPE), Brett (BRETT), and Pepecoin (PEPE) vying for investor attention. As each project gains momentum, the race to hit the coveted $1 mark has captivated the crypto community. Let’s break down what makes these meme coins unique and which one is most likely to reach $1 first. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Meme Coin with De-Fi Power Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly distinguished itself from other meme coins with its integration into decentralized finance (De-Fi). Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s ecosystem provides users with the ability to stake, lend, and trade their tokens through various De-Fi protocols. This added utility has given Mpeppe (MPEPE) a unique edge, attracting a broader investor base beyond just meme coin enthusiasts. With its use case extending into online gambling and financial services, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is seen as more than just a hype-driven meme coin. The question is: can this added functionality propel Mpeppe (MPEPE) to the $1 mark ahead of its competitors? Brett (BRETT): Riding the Meme Wave with Community Power Brett (BRETT) has made waves thanks to its viral branding and strong community support. Drawing inspiration from internet culture and memes, Brett (BRETT) has gained rapid adoption. Its simplicity and massive appeal among younger investors have helped it rise in the ranks. However, Brett (BRETT)’s lack of De-Fi utility puts it in a different category from Mpeppe (MPEPE). The community backing Brett (BRETT) is strong, and meme culture continues to fuel its momentum, but will the community alone be enough to push Brett (BRETT) to the elusive $1 mark? Pepecoin (PEPE): The OG Meme Coin Contender Pepecoin (PEPE) is arguably the original meme coin that pioneered the concept of meme-based cryptocurrencies. With a nostalgic connection to the internet meme “Pepe the Frog,” Pepecoin (PEPE) has maintained a strong presence in the market. Its branding has consistently helped it remain relevant, but with newer coins like Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Brett (BRETT) emerging, can Pepecoin (PEPE) reclaim its dominance and hit $1 first? While Pepecoin (PEPE) has a historical advantage, its lack of innovation compared to newer meme coins like Mpeppe (MPEPE) might slow its progress in the long run. The Role of Online Gambling in Driving Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Value One of the significant factors contributing to Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential to hit $1 is its connection to the online gambling industry. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers increased privacy, security, and transparency, making them attractive for use in online casinos. This use case expands Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal and sets it apart from competitors like Brett (BRETT) and Pepecoin (PEPE). By offering instant rewards through its gambling platform and capitalizing on the viral nature of meme coins, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has created a unique value proposition for investors looking for more than just a speculative play. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) Takes the Lead but the Battle Continues Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a frontrunner in the race to $1 due to its unique use cases and De-Fi integration, setting it apart from Brett (BRETT) and Pepecoin (PEPE). Investors must decide whether to favor Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s long-term potential or the viral appeal of Brett (BRETT) and Pepecoin (PEPE), making the race to $1 a closely watched one.

42390393,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1Mtr,1725870827,Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC Order Book Liquidity Says Yes,"The low order book liquidity suggests an impending bull reversal, according to Hyblock Capital.  Negative funding rates point to a potential short squeeze.  The market is fast moving into a positive macro environment, LondonCryptoClub said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} order books, which show the supply and demand dynamics for the largest cryptocurrency, are signaling a potential price bottom and a bullish shift on the horizon.  Data tracked by Hyblock Capital shows market depth, or the collection of buy and sell orders, both close to the going market rate and further away, dried up over the weekend. That's a pattern usually observed at market turning points, suggesting an end to BTC's decline from late-August highs above $65,000.  Liquidity, represented by market depth, gauges the market's ability to absorb large trading orders without influencing price. It tends to depend on several factors, including the time of day, prevailing market events and specific price levels.  Market bottoms are characterized by traders struggling to make decisive moves, leading to fewer buy and sell orders and a decline in liquidity.  ""By analyzing the combined spot order books, particularly at the 0%-1% and 1%-5% spot order book depth, we see a pattern where low liquidity in the order book often coincides with market bottoms,"" Shubh Verma, co-founder and CEO of Hyblock Capital, said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""These low order book levels can be early indicators of a price reversal, frequently preceding a bullish trend.""  ""It's a signal worth monitoring for traders looking to catch significant movements before they unfold. Understanding these imbalances can help identify key turning points in the market,"" Verma said.  The 1% market depth shows the total volume of buy and sell orders within 1% of the current mid-market price. The 5% depth represents liquidity 5% away from the current mid-price. Hyblock tracks market depth across multiple exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase.  Potential short squeeze and positive macro  Bitcoin changed hands at $54,800 at press time, up 4.3% from Friday's low of $52,530, according to TradingView data. Still, funding rates in the perpetual futures market tied to bitcoin remain negative, indicating a bias for bearish bets known as shorts, according to Coinglass.  So, if the market remains resilient, bears may throw in the towel, squaring off shorts and putting upward pressure on prices.  ""Positioning remains light, and with funding [rates] negative, the short-term 'pain trade' is perhaps higher,"" the LondonCryptoClub newsletter said in Sunday's edition.  The market is fast moving into positive macroeconomic developments for bitcoin, according to the newsletter.  ""Fiat, debt driven economies cannot sustain high real rates. The window to normalise rates and reduce central bank balance sheets, withdrawing liquidity, are typically small and that window has now firmly closed. Whilst we encourage short term caution as the market seeks assurances that the Fed will keep the party going, rest assured the punch bowl is about to be returned. Bitcoin and broader crypto investors will be getting drunk again quite soon,"" the newsletter reads.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/09/bitcoin-bottom-in-btc-order-book-liquidity-says-yes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12509f70db6db08948c73c383a4960ca0ad4b626-1278x719.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Woo X wants to reduce the pressure on lead traders to always outperform the market with the introduction of a countertrade feature.  Cryptocurrency exchange Woo X has introduced what it says is an enhanced and fairer version of copy trading, a way of emulating the expertise of seasoned traders by mimicking their market activities, the firm said on Monday.  Copy trading, or “social trading,” as Woo X calls it, is not new in either crypto or traditional finance. The practice of easily availing customers of the returns made by the most successful traders was made popular by fintech platform eToro and is also offered by several large crypto exchanges like Binance and OKX.  However, the existing model required recalibration, according to Woo X COO Willy Chuang, such that lead traders don’t just profit from exchange fees or other misaligned incentives. Another improvement was finding a way to reduce the consistent pressure on lead traders to always outperform, which prompted Woo X to add the flexibility of a countertrade option.  “We conducted extensive research and identified clear pain points for users,” Chuang said in an interview. “Many of the reported returns are misleading or unsustainable, and in some cases, users were being shilled by lead traders. We’ve introduced a higher profit threshold that protects users, ensuring that profits are only shared with lead traders when the portfolios are genuinely profitable.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/09/crypto-exchange-woo-x-introduces-copy-trading-with-a-twist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48dda79889d79af7eee2fdd9541ff616bdf56c60-1600x904.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price formed a base and recently started a recovery wave like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.0920 and $0.0935 resistance levels. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0994 swing high to the $0.0889 low.

The next major resistance is near the $0.0995 level. A close above the $0.0995 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1050 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1150 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1200. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.0995 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.0938 level. The next major support is near the $0.0900 level. The main support sits at $0.0880. If there is a downside break below the $0.0880 support, the price could decline further.

However, bitcoin appears attractive to traders at Presto Research at current prices, who said in a Monday note that they consider the asset “grossly undervalued.”  “Amid macro factors dominating BTC price talk lately, the market is overlooking one of the key fundamentals underpinning Bitcoin’s value – network security,” Presto analysts Peter Chung and Min Jung said. “The hashrate, the computational power that secures the network, has hit an all-time high of 679 EH/s, making it the most secure network by far.”  “If you believe that trend will continue (in fact, the availability of spot ETF means we are in a much better setup than ever before), BTC seems grossly undervalued at the moment,” they added.  Bitcoin (BTC) miners are expanding their capacity again since August, as previously reported, amid all-time highs in hashrate, which has typically marked price bottoms for the asset.  Elsewhere, some traders said the lower-than-expected U.S. payroll figures indicated a weaker labor market, while the lower unemployment figure has lessened the concerns of an imminent recession.  “It seems the lower-than-expected payroll data is dominating the market sentiment at the moment, as broad assets declined since Friday’s data,” Lucy Hu, senior analyst at Metalpha, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “We expect the crypto market will remain highly volatile leading to the next Fed meeting.”  However, bitcoin could see movement in the coming week as August’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures are scheduled for Wednesday, and Producer Price Index (PPI) figures on Thursday.  Also on Tuesday, crypto-friendly Republican candidate Donald Trump goes head to head with Democrat Kamala Harris, where voters are on the lookout for policy decisions. Trump has previously said he aims to make the U.S. the “crypto capital” of the world, and Harris aides are also reportedly considering policies to grow the industry.

The price is rebounding and must clear the $0.5480 resistance level to start a decent increase. XRP price is struggling to gain pace for a move above the $0.5350 zone. The price is now trading below $0.5320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could decline again if it fails to clear $0.5320 and $0.5480. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price extended losses below $0.5350 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a fresh decline, and the price retested the $0.5020 support zone. A low was formed at $0.5021 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a minor increase above the $0.520 level. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5626 swing high to the $0.5021 low. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. However, the bears seem to be active near the $0.5320 and $0.5350 levels. The price is now trading below $0.5350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5320 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5480 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5626 swing high to the $0.5021 low. The next key resistance could be $0.5550. A clear move above the $0.5550 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5620 resistance. The next major resistance is near the $0.5750 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5880 resistance or even $0.600 in the near term. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5320 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5220 level. The next major support is $0.5200. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5200 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5120 support in the near term. The next major support sits at $0.5020. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $58,508 swing high to the $52,569 low. The first key resistance is near the $55,500 level. A clear move above the $55,500 resistance might send the price further higher in the coming sessions. The next key resistance could be $56,200. A close above the $56,200 resistance might spark more upsides. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $57,500 resistance. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $55,500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $54,000 level. The first major support is $53,200. The next support is now near the $52,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $51,800 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $54,000, followed by $53,200.

42390411,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1YeB,1725844340,"U.S. Election Betting Delay Would Be 'Devastating' to Kalshi, Firm Says","Kalshi, the U.S. prediction market platform that just won a lawsuit against its regulator, said its future depends on being able to list election betting contracts while there's still time before Americans cast their votes on Nov. 5.  In a court filing Sunday, the New York-based company, which does business only in its home country, pushed back against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's emergency motion to bar it from listing such contracts for another 14 days. The motion is ""meritless,"" Kalshi said, and granting it would cause ""irreparable harm"" to the company.  ""That delay—which the agency would assuredly try to parlay into another, then another, until it is too late—would be devastating for Kalshi, which has staked its future on this litigation and these markets,"" the company told the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  Last year, the CFTC forbade Kalshi from listing contracts on which party would control each house of Congress after the election. Such contracts, the agency said, would amount to unlawful gaming and would be ""contrary to the public interest."" Kalshi then sued, calling the regulator's decision ""arbitrary [and] capricious.""  In a ruling handed down Friday, Judge Jia M. Cobb sided with Kalshi but did not give her rationale, which she said she would spell out in a subsequent opinion. She did not say when that opinion would be published.  Kalshi triumphantly declared on its website: ""We did it! U.S. election markets are coming to Kalshi.""  Hours later, the CFTC filed its emergency motion asking Cobb to stay her order for 14 days following publication of the opinion. Without knowing her reasoning, the agency said, it can't figure out whether it should appeal the decision.  If granted, the stay would mean Kalshi wouldn't be allowed to list election markets until late September at the earliest. The company, which settles trades in U.S. dollars, has been locked out of this year's election betting boom.  ""The Commission lost, fair and square, on the law,"" Kalshi said in its Sunday filing. ""It should not be allowed to snatch a procedural victory from the jaws of defeat by running out the clock.""  Kalshi is the only CFTC-regulated prediction market in the U.S. It lists contracts on a variety of events, ranging from whether U.S. students' test scores will improve or worsen to how high bitcoin will rise this year. (To be clear: Trades are settled in dollars.)  PredictIt, an older U.S. site that also settles bets in fiat, lists election contracts under a narrow regulatory exemption. Polymarket, this year's breakout success story in both prediction markets and cryptocurrency, is barred from doing business with U.S. residents under a settlement with the CFTC.  Even so, PredictIt and Polymarket have been ""accumulating market share at the expense of law-abiding Kalshi,"" the company told the court Sunday.  ""[A]s Kalshi has waited for the litigation process to run its course, unregulated operations like Polymarket have taken advantage of that time to dominate the market,"" Kalshi said. ""Further delays may make it impossible for Kalshi to meaningfully compete in this space.""  In a filing Monday, the CFTC called this claim ""questionable ... in light of Kalshi’s seemingly robust listing of hundreds of other non-political event contracts on its exchange.""  Noting that the proposed election contracts would allow positions up to $100 million, the regulator reiterated its concern that ""election gambling poses threats to election integrity and the perception of election integrity.""  As for the accusation of stalling, the agency said requesting a stay is ""a routine mechanism to allow the orderly administration of cases such as this one.""  The CFTC said it believes Kalshi ""may intend to list the election contracts imminently, without further self-certification (or, apparently, any notification to the court in its response to the CFTC’s motion or otherwise)."" Self-certification is the process whereby entities regulated by the CFTC list products without the agency's prior approval.  ""The public has already been denied these benefits for over a year, while the CFTC’s unlawful order was in place,"" Kalshi said Sunday. ""And with the election now fewer than 60 days away, there has never been a more important time for those benefits to materialize.""  Better Markets, a lobbying group that opposed Kalshi's plan, called the judge's Friday ruling in Kalshi's favor a ""Dangerous Step Towards Allowing Gambling on U.S. Elections, Threatening Democracy and the Integrity of our Markets.""
