42426946,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJy4th,1468531201,Samsung SDS Invests in Blockchain Startup,"An IT affiliate of South Korean electronics and manufacturing giant Samsung announced today that it has invested in a blockchain startup.  Samsung SDS said that it had invested in Blocko, a firm also based in South Korea, as well as a cybersecurity startup called Darktrace. The investment amount was not disclosed.  Blocko runs a blockchain-as-a-service platform called CoinStack, according to its website.  The firm said in a statement:  ""Samsung SDS will increase competitiveness of its cybersecurity business and services by promoting sales of the differentiated cyber threat defense solution by Darktrace to Korean companies, as well as work with Blocko to support commercialization of emerging blockchain technology in various sectors including IoT.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2016/07/14/samsung-sds-invests-in-blockchain-startup,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42426943,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJy4zh,1468523027,More Updates to Japan's Payment Rules for Virtual Currencies May Be on the Way,"A forthcoming report from Nomura Research Institute (NRI) suggests that more regulations aimed at bitcoin and digital currencies could be forthcoming in Japan.  Penned by senior consultant Yasutake Okano, the report centers on the Payment Services Act (PSA), a bill passed by Japan’s legislature in May. Debated for months, the bill brought domestic bitcoin exchanges under existing anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) rules by classifying virtual currencies as a type of prepaid payment instrument.  But Okano's work notes that the PSA revisions only extend so far. For example, he notes updates to the country’s Banking Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act may be needed to clarify how the technology fits under existing law.  The report notes that while the PSA now covers remittances in virtual currencies, this is only for payments up to ¥1m ($9,557), the current limit for prepaid instruments.  The report reads:  ""The PSA's ¥1m limit on transactions under its purview is seen as undermining payment services' utility for cross-border transactions.""  Okano also suggested updates to the nation’s tax laws related to virtual currencies could be considered, given decisions made by the European Court of Justice.  Okano wrote that while Japan's tax code exempts certain trades in currency, checks and bills, this does not yet apply to bitcoin and other digital currencies.  ""There have been a lot of discussions on it,"" Okano said.  Elsewhere, the report sees the new restrictions as unlikely to serve as a significant obstacle for digital currency exchange businesses, as it suggested any downsides in terms of increased reliability were likely to be balanced by a boost in consumer trust and adoption.

42426960,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJy5Th,1468518942,OpenBazaar 2.0: How Bitcoin’s Free Market eBay Plans to Go Global,"Within hours of online marketplace OpenBazaar's launch earlier this year, it was host to its first stores offering illegal merchandise.  But, it turns out that early precedent was not a harbinger of things to come at the distributed e-commerce platform, supported by VC-backed software startup OB1, which boasts investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures. The next phase of the open-source, distributed market, dubbed OpenBazaar 2.0, will be aimed at meeting mainstream demand.  From a new user interface making it easier for large companies to sell at scale, to a native bitcoin wallet aimed at simplifying the buying process, the new features are designed to reach the widest audience possible and expected to be rolled out over the coming months.  One of the more than 300 vendors online at any given moment is Sam Patterson, who in addition to helping manage the upgrades made by various members of the open-source community, runs OB1's own shop that sells a range of OpenBazaar swag.  Patterson estimates that of 7,000 items for sale at any given time, only about 200 are ""illicit"" and that global adoption is picking up pace.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The really neat thing we’ve seen beyond the enthusiasm is the mix between domestic and international users. While the primary users are certainly in the US, we ship products all over the world.""  Identifying users  While the identity of marketplace owners and their locations are not tracked by OB1, some information about users is obtainable with a bit of sleuthing from sites like Duosear.ch and BazaarBay.  So far, the OpenBazaar software has been downloaded in 190 countries and about 20,000 items have been listed.  Users tend to be small- and medium-size merchant with a ""strong tilt"" toward physical goods, which surprised Patterson, who is COO of OB1.  Due to the distributed nature of the network (which can only be shut down if the hosting store turns off its computer), and the borderless nature of bitcoin (the currency that powers the network), Patterson said he and his colleagues had expected a much stronger inclination to service-based offerings.  In a Google Chat last week among about a dozen OpenBazaar developers, Patterson estimated that 90% of the listings were for physical goods, 7% for digital goods and 3% for services.  While he said a decent portion of those offerings are NSFW, including custom pornography, he says few are illegal.  ""The most interesting observation is the lack of illicit transactions going on compared to what some people have anticipated,"" he said.  OpenBazaar concludes that the majority of their users are based in the US, with a recent increase in Asia, with uptake from China, Japan and Hong Kong.  A better distributed market  Last week, OB1 published plans made by OpenBazaar's open-source community, many of which are also OB1 employees, to attract larger corporations and more users from around the world.  Based on customer feedback, the color scheme of a new user-interface will be lightened and a new internal bitcoin wallet is intended to make it easier for shop owners and customers who aren't familiar with the cryptocurrency to more seamlessly make purchases.  Use of libbitcoin, a set of C++ libraries for bitcoin applications, will also no longer be required.  ""The current OpenBazaar requires they already know how to use bitcoin,"" said Patterson. ""As long as people can get bitcoin to OpenBazaar 2.0, they should be able to easily use it with the native wallet.""  Other changes include improved security that will change the encryption keys for each messaging session to prevent anyone who has obtained the key from gaining access to more than just a single dialogue.  Also, the search tool used to discover articles for sale will be improved, and private offerings will be enabled, meaning those products or services can only be discovered if a shopper has the URL.  Distributed shops  But the largest change is designed to expand the number of markets available at any given time, and it will involve a move of OpenBazaar’s back-end to the IPFS peer-to-peer distributed web protocol.  While the current peer-to-peer system is designed to be censorship resistant by distributing the network itself, the data for each shop is run locally, giving shop owners the ability to turn off the visibility of their shop by simply shutting down their computer.  That also means if the merchant wants to sell 24 hours a day, seven days a week, they can’t unless they leave their computer on the entire time. When IPFS integration is implemented the shop data itself will be distributed across the entire network.  Patterson concluded:  ""For sellers that makes it easier because they won’t have to run their stores 24/7. It also makes the stores more censorship resistant because if they are censored the data is still out there.""

42426951,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJy5Dh,1468504272,Report: Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles Released On Bail,"Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles has been released on bail 10 months after being charged with embezzlement, according to a Japanese media report.  Karpeles was charged in September amidst an investigation into the collapse of Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that, at its height was the most voluminous bitcoin exchange in the world.  Mt Gox collapsed in early 2014 after it was revealed that the exchange had lost hundreds of millions of dollars in customer bitcoin.  According to local Japanese media outlet news24, Karpeles paid ¥10m (roughly $95k) prior to being released on bail. Karpeles is reportedly prohibited from leaving the country.  Karpeles was arrested twice last year in connection with the investigation into alleged embezzlement. At the time, claims surfaced in local media that police suspected Karpeles had embezzled ¥321m (roughly $3m) in Mt Gox funds.  The collapse of Mt Gox ultimately sparked an effort by regulators in Japan to more closely oversee digital currency exchange activities.  Japanese legislators recently passed a law bringing exchanges under the country's anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer rules (KYC), a move that some say could lead to uncertainty for people and companies looking to work with the technology.  CoinDesk is continuing to follow this developing story.

42426953,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJy5Fh,1468498221,IBM Unveils New Cloud Blockchain Security Service,"IBM today unveiled a new service designed to help businesses test and run blockchain projects meant to handle private or sensitive data.  Dubbed the IBM 'secure blockchain cloud environment', the service is actually an integration of IBM’s existing blockchain cloud offering and IBM LinuxONE, a Linux server designed to protect against 'back doors' the company argues could occur in other cloud-based blockchain networks.  Overall, the company positioned the offering as one that seeks to improve the security of private, enterprise blockchain projects running in cloud environments by securing entry points and fighting against insider threats.  Recently elected IBM Fellow Donna Dillenberger explained how the cloud environment, when tapped into the IBM LinuxOne server, might help protect valuable data tracked by companies on a blockchain.  Dillenberger told CoinDesk:  ""The cloud is made up of a special hardware that protects the blockchain from hacks, from people who have unethically compromised root users or system administrator credentials.""  Using the security network, blockchain software applications built on IBM Blockchain are signed, encrypted and attested so that malware can't install itself or client applications.  Currently in limited beta, the product, the company said, is designed to provide a safe platform for companies to test the performance of proofs-of-concept and final products.  Additional features of the security network also include provisions intended to help meet security requirements of the financial, healthcare and government sectors and meet compliance requirements.  Securing diamond data  Also announced today, blockchain startup Everledger is using the network to power its global certification system, which tracks items such as diamonds and artwork through the supply chain.  The Everledger integration is intended to protect suppliers, buyers and shippers against theft and counterfeiting of valuable assets.  CEO and founder Leanne Kemp told CoinDesk that while her company has yet to experience direct attacks or ""any external threats"" since launching last year, the move to secure her service with IBM is a pre-emptive measure.  For example, in October, the Gemological Institute of America invalidated the grading reports of 1,042 diamonds after it was revealed that hackers had accessed the database and altered descriptions including both the color and clarity of the gemstones.  Kemp said such hacks are only just the beginning of future cybersecurity threats across industries as more information is stored in high-powered distributed databases.  Kemp concluded:  ""Some of the startups that are working in this space are too worried about the bells and whistles of the blockchain. But it’s actually a very serious technology that needs to be taken very seriously.""
