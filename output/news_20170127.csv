42379193,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQxX,1485542610,Watch Washington's Senate Debate If Buying Weed With Bitcoin is Bad,"Legislators gathered on Wednesday afternoon to hold a public hearing on a measure that would prohibit cannabis firms in the state of Washington from working with bitcoin.  CoinDesk reported last week that SB 5264, a bill presented by two Washington state senators, would ban businesses working in the marijuana industry from both selling products for bitcoin as well as purchasing them with the digital currency. At the time, primary sponsor Sen. Ann Rivers said that the measure was intended to boost financial transparency to the state’s cannabis sector as part of an effort to “help move it out of the shadows”.  The move sparked headlines and at least one petition aimed at stopping the measure in its tracks. Yet before the bill can become law, it has to move through the legislature, setting the stage for events like Wednesday’s hearing before the Washington Senate Commerce, Labor & Sports Committee.  The hearing drew a mixture of support and opposition for the bill, during which lawmakers asked a number of questions about the tech. Also appearing were representatives for the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board, which has called for businesses in the state to shift toward electronic payments.  Among those speaking against the measure were representatives from Posabit, a bitcoin point-of-sale developer based in Seattle.  In remarks, co-founder and CEO Ryan Hamlin spoke about the concerns among cannabis business owners who face the risk of robbery – a trend in the US affecting marijuana shops that rely on cash because they’re effectively locked out of the banking system owing to the nature of their business.  Hamlin told committee members:  ""Anyone can Google about the robberies that are happening. Cash in this environment is a problem.""  Hamlin reiterated the focus on store owner safety, arguing that ""we are removing cash from the system which is helping our customers become safer"".  Yet another payments company servicing marijuana firms in the industry expressed strong support for the bill. PayQwick offers payment services to businesses and consumers in the space, as well as cash handling services.  Kenneth Burke, the firm’s CEO, invoked the newly-minted Trump administration and the as-yet-unconfirmed US Attorney General nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions in his statements. Sessions, who according to Politico has called marijuana legal reform a ""tragic mistake"", is likely to enforce the federal ban on marijuana more decidedly than the Obama administration.  ""I think allowing bitcoin in consumer transactions in Washington is just going to invite extra scrutiny from Sessions and the federal government,"" Burke told the panel.  On traceability  One point of contention during the hearings was the question of whether bitcoin transactions are traceable.  Among those was Burke, who argued that ""with bitcoin, there’s just no traceability to it"".  But on the contrary, every bitcoin transaction is published to the public blockchain. Instead of being attached to a particular identity though, bitcoins are attributed to pseudonymous addresses. Actual identification of a user happens outside of the bitcoin system itself, as in the case of an exchange conducting a know-your-customer process.  Joseph Cutler, a partner for the law firm Perkins Coie who is based in the Seattle area, disputed the notion that bitcoin transactions can’t be traced.  “This idea that it’s untraceable is simply false. People also say bitcoin is anonymous,” he told the panel. “This is also false. We like to call it pseudonymous, which is better than cash.”  Cutler went on to invoke once again the problematic use of cash in cannabis businesses.  “In the marijuana space, for example, cash is king,” he said, adding:  “And there is no traceability to the customers for the cash they’re using in those stores.”  A video of the hearing can be found below:    Image via TVW",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/27/watch-washingtons-senate-debate-if-buying-weed-with-bitcoin-is-bad,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2f4b30de171a128a18f0030ccaf674e2b7693150-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42379191,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQv1,1485536108,Avoiding Catastrophe: Researchers Face Blockchain's Unknowns,"'Catastrophe' may have been the word of choice at a blockchain security conference held at Stanford University yesterday.  While cryptocurrencies and private blockchains heighten financial control to a degree, there's plenty that could go wrong with the new systems, and, perhaps spurred by interest from governments and institutions, experts from a range of disciplines are trying to pinpoint those unknowns.  The Blockchain Protocol Analysis and Security Engineering 2017 conference was brimming with examples of how this thinking is taking hold across the ecosystem's disparate sectors.  Even half a year after its collapse, The DAO – the first large-scale ethereum application – remains a major point of discussion (seeing as it also resulted in two competing ethereum blockchains). As such, talks were held on how new scripting languages might help to fix problems there.  But, through the presentations, one major thread emerged: since the technology is so new, it’s hard to figure out which risks are real ones.  Engineering consultant and conference organizer Byron Gibson told CoinDesk:  ""In terms of blockchain infrastructure, we're trying to get a better idea of how these systems could fail catastrophically and how to prevent that.""  He added that developers and researchers are searching for the problems that will have the highest impact, whether they have a low or a high probability of actually occurring.  Simulations  Overall, the conference placed a strong emphasis on preparing infrastructure to detect security problems that may take root down the road. At the same time, some argued that even the ways in which potential issues can be detected are not yet sufficiently mature.  One promising avenue might be simulation, using models to predict how blockchains react under different conditions. Three presentations dove specifically into how changes could impact bitcoin or other blockchains, envisioning how Internet protocol changes or block time intervals might impact their functionality.  ""These still need another 10 years or so of development before they get really, really good. But it's a good start,"" Gibson said.  And, in the eyes of many attendees, it's still a question of pinpointing the right risks.  During one session, Arvind Narayanan, assistant professor in computer science at Princeton, described how the end of bitcoin's block reward could result in attacks.  While he acknowledged the concept represents a long-term game theory problem, it's one that he argued is worth considering should the public blockchain come to serve a larger role in global commerce.  ""We have some time,"" he said.  Open-source  Alongside emerging technologies to detect problems, there might be social risks.  Angela Walch, associate professor at St Mary's University School of Law, pointed out in her presentation that the financial structure, as managed by several big institutions, never had to depend on open software before.  If public blockchains like bitcoin one day rule, this infrastructure would depend on a different set of rules, which she argued pose new risks.  ""I don’t think I have any answers here, but I have a lot of questions,"" she said when kicking off her presentation.  Others weren’t so worried about the dependence on a loose group of developers. One audience member pointed to the open-source operating system Linux as an example of a successful grassroots initiative.  While Linux isn't used by your average computer user, it has deep appeal to some sectors of the internet community and has been ported to more devices than any other operating system. Still, Walch said it's wise to start with skepticism.  ""There are risks that I think you can’t ignore or push under the rug. I think they need to be acknowledged more openly even if there’s a small chance of the worst case scenario actually happening,"" Walch later told CoinDesk.  She added:  ""I think the outcomes are potentially catastrophic and you need to take them into account.""  Debate frictions  Gibson also pointed out that there are new types of blockchains emerging right now, and that each variety might pose unique issues that simply aren't relatable with the others.  ""The permissioned ones are solving a simpler, better-understood problem than the permissionless ones. Maybe they have an advantage in that respect. But they're still untested technology platforms,"" he said.  And some seemed to think there was a rift between developers and academics at the conference. One developer attendee pointed out that, in his eyes, academics were not focused on the right problems.  Gibson had another take, arguing for a broader, more inclusive approach by all the industry's disparate constituents.  To him, it's worth examining the issue from all angles, telling CoinDesk:  ""I don't know if there’s any one security threat that takes precedence.""

42379192,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQtl,1485530436,Fed Paper: DLT and Digital Currency Could 'Change Payments Landscape',"A working group within the US central bank believes digital currencies and distributed ledgers could come to have a significant impact on how its citizens and businesses conduct payments.  The findings come from a 60-plus-page report published yesterday by the Faster Payments Task Force.  The report itself, the first of a two-part release, is largely an overview of the Federal Reserve task force's work to paint a picture of the US payments ecosystem as it exists today. This includes an analysis of trends that could shape how people pay in the year ahead, including digital currencies.  The Fed published a separate research report on distributed ledger tech in December.  According to the report's authors, the tech could lead to a shift in the composition of the US payments space, in terms of who is actually processing and clearing papers.  The paper states:  ""Distributed ledger technology (eg , blockchain) can potentially allow transactions to be verified and recorded across a distributed network of computers. This might change the roles of traditional players in payment clearing and settlement processes – for example, by eliminating the need for some types of centralized transaction bookkeeping.""  The report also includes a passing reference to central bank-issued digital currencies, a concept being explored by central banks like the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, among others.  “Digital currencies have the potential to change the payments landscape, particularly if adopted by one or more major central banks,” it reads.  The second release, expected to be published later this year, will include specific recommendations for improving the US payments ecosystem. Whether that report will include recommendations related to blockchain or digital currencies remains to be seen.  Notably, the Faster Payments Task Force includes industry startups like Circle Internet Financial, Digital Asset and Ripple among its membershiphttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/faster-payments/about-the-task-force/roster/.

42379183,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQjh,1485527429,Royal Bank of Canada Sees Role for Public Blockchains in Secure Payments,"Canada's largest bank is seeking a patent for a secure means of processing payments that could connect with a public blockchain.  On 19th January, the US Patent and Trademark Office published an application from the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) for ""secure processing of electronic payments"". The application, submitted in July 2016, details the use of trusted devices to administer, process and store payment transactions, in an environment utilizing digital wallets and merchant-based points-of-sale (POSs).  As envisioned, some of these applications could be used to connect to an unspecified public blockchain.  The RBC application notes:  ""Among the many advantages offered by trusted platforms, trusted devices, and other systems, devices, and processes in accordance with the invention is the ability they provide to adapt to developing technologies. For example, one or more trusted devices, including for example one or more mPOSs, may participate in, or otherwise be associated with, various forms of public ledgers, such as blockchains.""  Later, the application details how the concept could include support for a variety of currencies, including bitcoin.  ""[T]he trusted platform...is enabled to pay the merchant in the merchant's preferred format (including choice of currency, such as dollars, euros, pounds, roubles, or yen, or electronic currency such as bitcoin) using suitably-configured signals and data exchanges,"" it states.  While the application hints at some of the areas in which RBC is looking to potentially incorporate blockchain, the bank has been open about its work with the tech in the past.  Early last year, RBC indicated that payments was one area in which it was looking to the technology for possible applications. It later tested a remittance concept in partnership with distributed ledger startup Ripple.

42379185,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQmD,1485525628,"Bosch, Cisco, Gemalto and More: Tech Giants Team Up For Blockchain-IoT","The Internet of Things (IoT) – the vast web of connected devices which is becoming a fundamental part of the technological infrastructure that surrounds us – brings both huge potential and great risk.  On the plus side, the transition from ‘dumb’ to ‘smart’ devices represents a sea change in the way we think about automation and responsiveness in the products around us: cars which drive themselves, apartments which become self-regulating environments, and appliances which optimise automatically for each user’s unique preferences.  But as a consequence, every connected device is another attack surface for a hacker to target, and significant concerns have been expressed about the growing number of IoT devices which have been weaponised into botnets or used as surveillance tools.  Evidence of these high-profile breaches means that attempts to increase trust and security between IoT devices are crucial – so it’s big news that a group of Fortune 500 companies from the hardware and software industries is joining with a team of blockchain startups to develop a protocol that will connect the dots between IoT devices and blockchain technology.  The initiative was born out of the New Horizons: Blockchain x IoT Summit in Berkeley, California, in December 2016 – a meeting that brought together startups Ambisafe, BitSE, Chronicled, ConsenSys, Distributed, Filament, Hashed Health, Ledger, Skuchain and Slock.it, and major corporations BNY Mellon, Bosch, Cisco, Gemalto and Foxconn.  Discussed at the event were the challenges facing blockchain and IoT innovation, and the potential for a collective effort to address them.  Many of the larger corporations have already expressed strong interest in Internet of Things technology. For example, Bosch’s most recent annual report, the 2015 review titled Simply.Connected, set out a vision to be “one of the world’s leading IoT companies” by focusing on sensor technology, software and services, while Cisco, known for making networking equipment, has a clear interest in being at the forefront of embedded networking.  But the interest in blockchain represents a more recent direction: electronics manufacturers like Foxconn, for example, have not historically been associated with this field. So what are the challenges and opportunities that have led them to team up with blockchain startups?  The need for trust  In the manufacturing space, big business has already shown interest in using blockchain technology in supply chain logistics, where cryptographic signatures can be used to assure the identity of items at each stage of transit and after sale (Chronicled, a member of the consortium, has compiled a list of case studies of this kind).  For Internet-enabled devices, identity verification becomes even more important for manufacturers, since they will be sending and receiving data across a larger network. Even when devices are trusted, the integrity of data sent between them still needs to be validated; hence the gains that can be made by signing and confirming data at each stage of the way.  One of the larger companies involved, digital security provider Gemalto, has worked on secure machine-to-machine (M2M) communication for the past 10 years, and is now applying this experience to the newer field of blockchain technology.  Joe Pindar, director of product strategy and CTO at Gemalto, told CoinDesk that the intention is to build an abstraction layer such that a handful of core functions that IoT vendors might need – for example, registering new devices or changing ownership – can be implemented in such a way that the code can be used with different blockchains.  ""It means that a new IoT startup can concentrate on building their app and getting the core value of the integrity that blockchain delivers, but at some point in the future if they decide that their first choice, say bitcoin, wasn't the right way to go, they can switch to ethereum and it doesn't hurt them,"" Pindar said.  The upshot of this is that once the protocol is released, new startups will be able to build products around it in a standardised way without needing to put time and resources into developing bespoke solutions each time.  Beyond the barcode  According to Ryan Orr, CEO of Chronicled, the development of the blockchain/IoT protocol can be seen as the next phase in a technological pathway that started with the barcode, the original digital product identifier.  “The barcode was a simple and unique system that led to huge improvements in the retail industry,” Orr said. “Unfortunately the system was not secure, so you have trillions of dollars of counterfeiting today ... Once we have a secure system of identity that’s open and interoperable, I think the implications will be as big as the barcode over 10 to 20 years.”  Besides product identifiers, the consortium also sees big potential in a protocol that will connect the IoT with the functionality of smart contracts.  Slock.it, another consortium member and developer of the much discussed DAO, focuses on use cases meant to facilitate sharing economy services without needing a middleman: for example, using smart contracts and an Internet-enabled lock to let guests into an apartment in an Airbnb-style rental.  In a statement, Dirk Slama, chief alliance officer at Bosch Software Innovations, said:  “We are seeing tremendous potential for the application of blockchain in industrial use cases. Being able to create a tamperproof history of how products are manufactured, moved and maintained in complex value networks with many stakeholders is a critical capability. This must be supported by a shared blockchain infrastructure and an integrated Internet of Things protocol.”  Future announcements outlining a timeline for the project will follow, but members are optimistic that results will emerge quickly.  Orr said:  ""It wouldn't surprise me if a dozen PoC's come out of this in the next 12 months.""

42379188,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nQpz,1485523854,A Digital Currency Scam is Misusing the Rothschild Family Name,"Financial advisory firm Rothschild & Co. issued an unusual warning on Monday: stay away from a ""fraudulent"" digital currency.  The company said that an investment scheme dubbed “LCF Coins” or “Rothschild Family LCF Project” is making the rounds in China, invoking its name as part of a fundraising bid. Rothschild & Co was founded in the mid-1800s, becoming a powerful force in the areas of private banking and wealth management.  As one might be expected, the firm took a harsh stance against the digital currency's alleged premise.  The notice warned:  “This scheme purports to be a fund for investment in relation to virtual currencies and the ""Internet of Things"" and to pay out money in tranches based on the time people invested. This indicates that the fund is very similar to a Ponzi scheme.”  BehindMLM, a publication that focuses on multi-level marketing schemes, published a report in January on LCF, which reportedly sought to drum up support by invoking the names of former US president George Bush and former UK prime minister Tony Blair, among others.  Among the claims specific to the Rothschild advisory firm was the assertion that the company was building a central office for LCF Coin. The site further warned that those peddling LCF Coin were collecting personal information that could be used to fuel identity theft.  Rothschild & Co. said that it was moving to address the use of the name.  ""Rothschild & Co has taken various steps to draw the attention of the public in China to the fact that this unregulated scheme is misappropriating the 'Rothschild' name without authorisation, and continues to offer co-operation with the authorities,"" the company said.  This isn’t the first time a major financial firm published a warning about a fake digital currency.  In November 2015, JPMorgan spoke out against “JPM Coin”, which utilized the same form of multi-level marketing approach seen in other digital currency schemes.. The bank told would-be investors at the time that it “has not authorised any virtual currency (of this type or similar in any way)”.

42379199,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nR1J,1485483618,Bitcoin's Volume is Continuing to Decline at Major Exchanges,"Bitcoin trading volume continued to slide on 26th January, as market sentiment showed signs it has yet to fully brush off the impact of new policies at major China-based exchanges.  Overall trading volume has declined substantially in the days since OKCoin, BTCC and Huobi began charging trading fees on 24th January, and there are signs that these exchanges are acknowledging what could be a continued issue.  Xu Qing, a spokesperson for Huobi, noted how these developments are impacting his exchange, telling CoinDesk: ""The trading volume started plunging since we started charging trading fees.""  In the face of this, sentiment is ""bruised,"" according to Kong Gao, overseas marketing manager for over-the-counter trading desk Richfund.  He went so far as to claim that some market participants are beginning to look to other assets for improved returns, stating:  ""I see many bitcoin traders going back to trading stocks.""  In spite of this lackluster sentiment and falling volumes, however, bitcoin prices did manage to notch some modest gains today, rising as much as 2.8% to $919.13.  The digital currency was slightly lower at $918 at the time of report.  China hit hard  While volumes were expected to decline on the first day of the change, what's notable is that this downtrend is showing no signs of stopping, data reveals.  Market participants traded only 10,100 BTC through OKCoin, the leader in volumes in the 24 hours through 22:00 UTC on 26th January, Bitcoinity data shows.  This figure represents a mere fraction of the daily average of 23,000 BTC that the digital currency exchange saw over the last seven days. In addition, it represented a sharp decline when compared to trading volume over the last few days.  OKCoin’s 26th January figure, for example, was close to 30% lower than the 25th January figure of 13,900 BTC, and upwards of 90% below the 24th January total of 82,000 BTC, according to additional Bitcoinity data.  The chart below shows the declining transaction activity this exchange experienced over the last few days:  BTCC, the runner up in terms of market volume, encountered a similar situation, seeing only 7,100 BTC worth of trades during the 24 hours through 22:00 UTC on 26th January.  Today's session fell far short of the average daily volume of 160,000 that the exchange has enjoyed over the last week.  The graph below shows the sharp falloff that BTCC trading volume has seen:  Even outside of China, Bitfinex, which is now in third place in terms of volume, also saw a notable decline in activity. Market participants traded only 7,000 BTC through the exchange during the 24 hours through 22:00 UTC.  This figure was more than 30% lower than the average over the last seven days, Bitcoinity data reveals.  But while Bitfinex has seen a decline in volume over the last few sessions, its drop has been far less severe than the decrease suffered by the major Chinese exchanges.  Bitfinex has not updated its policies in recent weeks.  Assessments vary  Analysts indicated that the decline may have been bigger than expected, a concern that is also contributing to depressed sentiment.  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, spoke to this situation: ""This has surprised many in the industry as the ‘real’ demand for bitcoin trading in China is much lower than what people expected,"" he said.  Yet, while several analysts emphasized the key role played by market sentiment, some pointed to the calendar as the chief contributor for the slump.  The Chinese New Year is only a few days away, noted Arthur Hayes, and as a result, ""volumes are declining rapidly.""  He added:  “Volumes and price action will be down for at least the next week.”  Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund, voiced his doubts about this explanation, stating that while the Chinese New Year may be driving the recent decline in volume, he is ""doubtful"" this holiday is to blame.  Instead, he emphasized the lack of new macro events, which might otherwise prompt market participants to trade bitcoin.
