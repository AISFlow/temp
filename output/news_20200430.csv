42431843,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6uVh,1588279472,Market Wrap: There's a Bright Side to Bitcoin's Drop on Worsening Unemployment,"Bad U.S. jobless data pulled markets lower Thursday, affecting even bitcoin. But there may be a silver lining for the cryptocurrency.      At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency was up just 1% over 24 hours at $8,864, with 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages converging, thus signaling sideways sentiment. After bitcoin prices jumped to their highest levels in nearly two months, up as much as $9,478 on Coinbase in early trading Thursday, dismal unemployment numbers cut the gains down to size.      Read more:Bitcoin Options Trading Volumes Surge as Price Moves Above $9.4K      Increasing unemployment is causing investors increasing concern. Another 3.8 million Americans filed for jobless claims this week, bringing the total to 30 million in the past six weeks after the coronavirus pandemic significantly slowed economic activity.      The hits just keep on coming for the U.S. economy. The unemployment data came a day after GDP numbers showed the worst U.S. economic output since 2014. While Wednesday's dismal economic data didn’t give markets a reality check, it was a different story when it came to showing how many people are out of work. The S&P 500 index slipped 1% Thursday. Europe’s FTSE Eurotop 100 index of largest companies in Europe also closed down, by 2.3%.    A bright side    But Catherine Coley, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance US, sees a bright side to the bitcoin dip. She thinks the poor economic data may give some investors an incentive to investigate more closely - and then buy - cryptocurrencies. “With unemployment and stimulus funding flooding our system, I think more people are looking for an alternative exposure to a market that's unrelated"" to U.S. dollars, Coley said.      Alex Mashinsky, CEO of digital asset lender Celsius Network, said he's seen retail investors getting more curious about crypto. “Many first-time retail investors are flocking to bitcoin as a way to protect their wealth,"" he said.      Read More:Bitcoin Now Crushing Gold After Biggest Price Jump in Six Weeks      “Governments around the world are implementing unprecedented fiscal stimulus, which risks causing high inflation across fiat currencies, which reinforces bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset,” added Mashinsky.      But investing in bitcoin is not without risk and Mostafa Al-Mashita of Secure Digital Markets, a Canadian crypto brokerage firm, sees rocky times for bitcoin ahead despite its long-term potential. “We will continue to see volatility increase for the next eight weeks as the market finds a fair market value for bitcoin based on the supply and demand of the asset,” he said.      Some of this volatility has funds like Singapore-based QCP Capital carefully weighing their next moves in the spot crypto market. “We remain core long bitcoin and short puts, but have now turned cautious on our spot holdings,” QCP wrote in a Wednesday analysis note.      Al-Mashita said price volatility could continue as miners affect the market, particularly the spot market where they sell bitcoin mining rewards to pay required expenses in cash like rent, labor and electricity. “The volatility will be greater than ever as the hashrate difficulty adjusts before and after the halvening is complete,” he added.      Read more:Older Mining Machines Turn Profitable Again as Bitcoin Rises Ahead of Halving      Bitcoin network hashrate has been rising as the May 12 halving approaches. Some analysts and observers forecast a reduction in computing power used once the network’s reward reduction occurs.      Bitcoin halving-related FOMO, or ""fear of missing out"" as it’s often called, was likely stirred up Wednesday when bitcoin’s price rose 13% in 24-hour trading at one point. More frenzy is expected as the bitcoin halving event gets closer, according to Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.      “For bitcoin, I think we’re going to see some more FOMO here ahead of the halving, then maybe some sharp sell-off straight after the event. Then, a climb through the second half of the year,” Thomas said.    Other Markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board performed poorly Thursday, with most in the red. The second-largest coin by market cap, ether (ETH), briefly hit $227 on spot exchanges like Coinbase, a high not seen since early March. Ether lost 1.7% in 24-hour trading as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).      Digital asset losers in trading include tron (TRON) dipping 5.5%, eos (EOS) dropping 5% and iota (IOTA) in the red 3.8%. All price changes were as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).

Meanwhile, gold traded down 1.4% and closed the New York trading session at $1,686. The yellow metal is up 8% on the year while bitcoin has been in the green 31% YTD as of April 30.      U.S. Treasury bonds climbed Thursday. Yields, which move in the opposite direction as price, were mixed, with yields on the 2-year down 10 percent.

42431828,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6txh,1588271028,CBDCs Come in Many Forms – Here's a Quick Guide,"George Calle is Market Intelligence Lead at R3, an enterprise blockchain software firm.      In just a few short years, digital currencies have progressed hugely. But while the early adopters of cryptocurrencies dreamed of entirely new digital coins transforming the way we pay for things, the volatility of cryptos like bitcoin has made this vision impossible, to date. As a result, the most common retail use for digital currencies is speculative trading.       Yet, the underlying technology has been adopted by the largest financial institutions in the world, providing significant efficiencies and opening new business opportunities. Now, even the world’s central banks are looking at how to bring blockchain-based payment tokens back to the retail markets.       Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are in active pilot across the world (see our recent report). The People’s Bank of China has its digital yuan project and Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, has announced a pilot for a digital version of its currency for retail use, dubbed the e-krona. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are all exploring the technology.       See also: Ajit Tripathi - 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital Currencies      The global pandemic has given additional impetus to this trend. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the so-called “central banks’ central bank,” recently said contaminated bills may be the catalyst for central banks to deliver a digital cash alternative for payments. Similarly, members of the U.S. Congress have recently called for a “digital dollar.”       In part, central banks are responding to challenges from private-sector initiatives, such as the Facebook-backed Libra Association. In addition, CBDCs also suggest substantial benefits for general purpose use which make them highly attractive in their own right. The digital nature of the currencies will modernize payments, making them more efficient and financially inclusive. Additionally, depending on the implementation, they could lead to a more transparent retail payment system, reducing black market trade. Meanwhile, central banks may benefit from easier facilitation of monetary policy and an increase in revenues.       Recent CBDC models take a collaborative approach with the private sector. For example, the Bank of England is researching what it calls the “platform model” in which the central bank is the only entity allowed to create or destroy a token, while leaving “payment interface providers” (PIPs) to interact with end users.       The proposal gives PIPs the responsibility to maintain Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks, while providing them with the freedom to build customer relationships and differentiate themselves by providing additional services on top of the core payments.       Others have gone a step further. Researchers at the International Monetary Fund recently coined the term synthetic CBDC (sCBDC) to describe a model in which a non-central bank entity, such as a commercial bank, can issue a stablecoin backed by central bank reserves.     The most common retail use for digital currencies is speculative trading.    Blockchain is crucial in enabling the tokenization of payment assets, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions and distributed custody. Additionally, blockchain enables atomic transactions, which means any conditional payment scenario, such as the delivery of a security in exchange for payment (DvP), can occur, in real time, without risk that one leg of the transaction will execute before the other.       Digitizing the payment methods on blockchain enables easy connectivity into a growing tokenized financial ecosystem. This could include the facilitation of faster and cheaper cross-border payments, as well as tying CBDCs into other token uses, such as the new crop of ‘digital exchanges’ using blockchain to combine trading and post-trade services into a seamless whole. For example, the Swiss National Bank is working with the SIX Digital Exchange to explore how market participants can settle tokenized assets on the exchange with central bank money.       See also: Inside China’s Plan to Power Global Blockchain Adoption      Finally, blockchain also sets the architecture for a more secure payment system in which there is no centralized point of failure for hackers to attack.       Looking forward, we can imagine a completely new architecture for money – a step change as significant as the invention of the credit card. Widespread access to CBDC will be key for central banks to fulfill their mandate of offering modern payments solutions. Additionally, it will catalyze connectivity between the general public, corporations and the financial industry with parallel innovations currently being built out by firms leveraging blockchain in non-payments related areas, such as tokenized exchanges or HQLAx’s collateral and liquidity management platform as just two examples. Central banks have a tremendous opportunity to orchestrate and provide purchasing power into this ecosystem.       Ultimately, we are likely to see a variety of uses for CBDCs in the retail space and a number of different implementations. Some central banks will issue CBDC directly to the general public. In other cases, a financial institution with a central bank account could issue stablecoins backed by reserves. Additionally, access may be facilitated through a network of financial institutions and payment companies that distribute CBDC to their customers.       In such a model, the job of the designated provider would be to manage and monetize that client relationship and deliver a superior user experience, in competition with other designated financial institutions, fintechs or payment companies. It provides the benefits of tokenized money to those who want it, and the benefits of simple account based services to those who don’t want to manage private keys.       Whatever the exact CBDC implementation in the retail space, it will have important benefits for a wide variety of institutions, from banks to corporate treasury departments to payment networks open to the general public.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,George Calle,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/30/cbdcs-come-in-many-forms-heres-a-quick-guide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8a563cbc3a4697311ee63c64013ba6c80a1ae7e-1256x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431838,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6uLh,1588269037,Bitcoin Whale Addresses Hit Highest Number Since August 2019,"Large crypto investors, popularly known as “whales,” seem to be accumulating bitcoin amid the ongoing price rally.      The seven-day moving average of the number of addresses holding 10,000 bitcoins or more rose to 111 on Wednesday, the highest level since Aug. 2, 2019, according to blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. That number has risen by more than 11% since early March.      “The increase in the number of BTC addresses with more than 10,000 BTC is likely the result of long-term holders coming back online to expand their holdings,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.      Increased interest from long-term holders and large investors could be associated with the bullish narrative surrounding the macro factors and the upcoming reward halving.      “Some of these addresses may belong to high-net-worth individuals or groups, who are diversifying into bitcoin amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and ahead of the mining reward halving, due in the next two weeks,” said Wayne Chen, CEO of Interlapse Technologies and founder of Coincurve, a cryptocurrency purchasing, and spending platform.      Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million and its monetary policy is pre-programmed to cut the pace of supply expansion by 50 percent every four years.      Hence, many advocates tout bitcoin as a safe haven asset and an inflation-hedge like gold. They claim the economic destruction caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the unprecedented money printing exercises undertaken by the global central banks and governments to bode well for bitcoin’s price.      “Amid the deteriorating economic outlook for the U.S. economy and the likelihood of an ever-increasing monetary supply, which weakens the U.S. dollar and stokes inflation fears, we believe bitcoin could easily test previous highs above $19,000 as investors look for safe havens away from traditional assets,"" said Simon Peters, analyst and crypto asset expert at global investment platform eToro.      Such bullish predictions have been doing the rounds for more than six weeks now and could have enticed large investors to add bitcoins to their portfolio.      Further, expectations that the mining reward halving, due on May 12, would put bitcoin on a long-term bullish trend could be the reason for the rise in the number of so-called “whale addresses.”      Bitcoin undergoes a process called mining reward halving every four years, which controls inflation by reducing mining rewards by 50%. Following the May 2020 halving, the reward per block mined will drop from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Many investors anticipate the cryptocurrency’s price would go up after halving, as the asset would become more scarce to satisfy the demand. Reinforcing this belief is the historical data, which shows bitcoin experienced solid bull runs in the year following previous halvings.      “At the first halving in November 2012, the price went from $11 to over $1100 a coin a year later. Then after the second halving in July 2016, bitcoin went from $600 to over $20,000 by the end of 2017,"" said George McDonaugh, managing director and co-founder of publicly listed cryptocurrency and blockchain investment firm KR1 plc.      However, reward halving also means a 50% reduction in miners’ revenue. So, if the price fails to rally sharply post-halving, small and inefficient miners may shut down operations and offload their holdings to cover costs, leading to a price drop.    Bullish narrative reinforced    Bitcoin was trading near $8,900 at press time, a 130% gain from the low of $3,867 reached on March 13, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Bitcoin is now reporting a bigger year-to-date gain compared to gold. While the cryptocurrency is up 21%, the yellow metal has seen a 12% increase.      The year-to-date performance may reinforce the narrative that bitcoin is a hedge against global economic malaise, fiscal and monetary indiscipline and could continue to draw demand from both small and large investors.      See also: Stacking Sats? Small Bitcoin Holders on the Rise, Data Suggests      ""The year-to-date performance indicates that investors’ awareness of the digital asset has increased and its role as a potential diversification vehicle for traditional portfolios has been underscored by its strong recovery from its recent lows, relative to more traditional markets. We expect this strength to persist as Bitcoin continues to take pole position in the race,"" said Stack's Dibb.    Not a perfect indicator    The rise in the number of unique addresses holding more than 10,000 bitcoins does not necessarily mean an influx of new whales into the market. After all, a single investor can hold multiple addresses.      Further, cryptocurrency exchanges tend to hold large balances. For instance, two of the top five addresses on the rich list (a table of the addresses holding the most bitcoins), published by bitinfocharts.com, belong to prominent exchanges Huobi and Bitfinex.      See also: The ‘Great Lockdown’ Is Boosting Demand for Bitcoin Custody Solutions      “Some of these addresses are owned by top exchanges which usually hold large reserves in their cold wallet.

FOMO is seen elsewhere in the market, as derivatives products soar 300% on daily trading volumes and Grayscale reported a notable uptick in shares of its Bitcoin Trust. Meanwhile, a16z is making another long-term play, launching its second, larger crypto fund. Here's the story:      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.      Delayed Telegram Messaging app Telegram postponed the launch of its TON blockchain for a second time on Wednesday, pushing the new launch date to April 2021. This delay triggers a clawback clause in which the company will offer to return up to 72% of each investor's stake from its initial $1.7 billion token sale in 2018. Investors can choose to loan their capital to Telegram in exchange for a higher equity stake next year.      Back in Business Obsolete mining equipment is becoming profitable again, at least for a short time. According to the miner profitability index, tracked by mining pools PoolIn and F2Pool, older mining rigs, such as Bitmain's AntMiner S9 or Canaan's Avalon A851, can now generate a 10%-20% gross margin at an average electricity cost of $0.05 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).      Second Crypto Fund Andreessen Horowitz has raised $515 million for its second crypto fund. The firm launched an initial $300 million crypto-focused in 2018. (Fortune)      Jump Shares Amid the sharp rise in bitcoin's price Wednesday, shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) also saw notable gains of 14.3% on the day. Grayscale's Ethereum Trust also saw a 7.7% jump to $104.50 per share. (Disclosure: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)      Coinbase Outage Coinbase experienced a brief outage Wednesday as the price of bitcoin rallied to just below $9,000. The largest U.S. exchange by trading volume reported $300 million in daily transactions by Wednesday afternoon, dwarfing its average from the previous seven days. Kraken, another major exchange, also experienced some web issues.      Legal Dispute Micree Ketuan Zhan, the ousted co-founder and former chairman of leading bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer Bitmain, has scored a partial legal victory over his former employer. The court has granted Zhan’s request to block the company from registering a new legal representative. The legal dispute is the latest chapter in Zhan’s ongoing struggle with Bitmain since he was ousted by his fellow co-founder Jihan Wu last October.      New Standard A Swiss-based nonprofit focused on advancing the adoption of blockchain technology has published a common industry standard for the custody and management of digital assets. (CoinTelegraph)      Blockstack's Business Blockstack’s financial operations have run almost exclusively on Stacks token sales. The company brought in $23.3 million last year, $23 million of which came from its Regulation A+ compliant token sale in September 2019, according to SEC filings Wednesday. Its 2017-2018 revenues came from exempted token sales, the filing showed. The Block reports this represents a 37% fall in its 2019 revenue due lower sales of its Stacks token.      Tencent Accelerator Tencent has launched a blockchain accelerator program. The Tencent Industrial Accelerator is looking to mentor 30 startups and established firms looking to enter the blockchain industry. (The Block)      Portugal's Sandbox Portugal has approved a nationwide plan to encourage digitalization and experimentation with emerging technologies. While it covers a wide field of technological advances, the “Digital Transitional Action Plan” will also provide tax breaks for cryptocurrency trading and issuance and encourage firms working with blockchain, CoinTelegraph reports.      Chain' Links to Tezos Pricing feed protocol Chainlink has integrated with another blockchain, this time Ethereum rival Tezos. The integration means Tezos projects can pull from active pricing feeds for various assets to build out products, such as the bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi) application recently created by the Bitcoin Association Switzerland.      Pierce's PPE Brock Pierce’s Puerto Rican nonprofit has teamed up with Binance to buy $1 million in personal protective equipment to help fight coronavirus in Puerto Rico.      Copycats Be Warned Alibaba has patented a blockchain-based program to vet the originality of songs. Granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on April 21, the patent describes a blockchain comprised of several library nodes and one validation node, which evaluates how similar a song's tune, tempo and other factors such as lyrics and beat are to other tracks in the library.      Cohn on Crypto/COVID-19 The COVID-19 crisis will hasten the adoption of digital assets, according to a Financial Times op-ed penned by former Trump adviser Gary Cohn. The former director of the US National Economic Council now sits on the advisory board of blockchain startup Spring Labs.

42431830,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6u7h,1588264216,The 'Great Lockdown' Is Boosting Demand for Bitcoin Custody Solutions,"Thanks in part to the uncertainty of the coronavirus crisis and rising bitcoin prices, bitcoin wallet startups have seen a sudden uptick in activity.      For example, over the past two months the Austin, Texas-based bitcoin startup Unchained Capital, with over $50 million in assets under management and $150 million worth of bitcoin transactions processed, garnered several dozen new institutional clients, representing hundreds of individuals. Will Cole, Unchained’s chief product officer, said the custody product Vault saw 340% growth in Q1 2020 as compared to the previous quarter.      “We’ve seen a big uptick in the creation of Vaults,” Cole said. “An event like that [pandemic] makes people think about how they are storing their bitcoin.”      Unchained is working on a wallet update with new privacy features. It allows users to sort UTXO (unspent transaction output) information, which makes it possible to reveal less information about oneself to an external recipient, even while using a public blockchain.      Read more: Bitcoin Firms Report Uptick in Demand for Inheritance Services      Unchained adviser Christopher Allen, founder of the not-for-profit benefit corporation Blockchain Commons, said the industry still doesn’t have clear terminology that distinguishes the Vault custody solution, where both Unchained and the client have keys to a multisig wallet versus wallets where only the user holds keys. Regardless, there appears to be increased interest in wallets where users hold keys, in some form.      “Custody requires keys that are under your control or under collaborative custody with others. But it isn't self-sovereign if they can unilaterally block your recovery,” Allen said. “There are many other companies and teams involved who all desire to make multisig easier, more standard, and allow you to choose different approaches or implementations knowing that you are not locked into a single solution.”      Such setups, like Vaults, make sense for companies and families that want to manage significant funds without a single person being in control of the wallet.    Not alone    These days many of the industry’s large wallet businesses appear to be growing, in terms of both profits and users.      For more private options geared toward individual users, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees said there are far more people using his software wallet solution this year. As such ShapeShift, acquired the Israeli wallet startup Portis for an undisclosed amount in April. This decreased the company’s compliance risks and solidified its position in the industry's self-custody sector, slightly less lucrative than custodial crypto exchanges yet growing at a comparable rate.      “This is the first recession the world has seen since cryptocurrency existed,” Voorhees said. “We want people to think of ShapeShift as the self-custody interface for all the various crypto services out there.”      Like ShapeShift, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier, whose startup is scaling up to meet increased demand for hardware wallets, said his wallet will also allow users to do “all the complex things you can do with a coin” directly through the Ledger Live app.      Read more: Bitcoin Garners New Users as Governments Flood World With Fiat      “We do see an increase in downloads of Ledger Live, our hardware wallet companion app, as we are adding more coins,” Gauthier said. “Nowadays, our main revenue comes from the hardware wallet business. … Our revenue model will evolve to one-off revenues, transactional and recurring revenues thanks to additional services.”    Revenue models    After several years of operation, many incumbent crypto companies now feel pressure to deliver returns for investors. It’s unclear which business models will best suit the crypto economy.      “Every day I think about acquisitions for a minute, then decide against it,” Gauthier said. “Ledger has enough money in the bank, a good business. …There’s a question about where this industry is going and what does that mean for the future.”      Unchained Capital earns revenue from clients who pay for the multisig Vaults or loan services associated with its open source wallets. The startup relies on subscriptions from a small number of wealthy clients for profits, even if it also serves less-lucrative retail users. On the other hand, ShapeShift profits from in-app referrals to exchanges and other services.      Voorhees said he acquired Portis because the startup’s tech allows for a familiar login, akin to Facebook Login, but where users need to actually remember their passwords.      Read more: ShapeShift’s New Platform Aims to Make Crypto Self-Custody as Easy as Coinbase      Stepping back, Portis was founded in 2018 and attracted the attention of legendary Israeli tech investor Eddy Shalev. The Block reported Portis nearly shut down in Q1 2020, since co-founder Itay Radotzki quit in January and eight employees were subsequently laid off. Portis co-founder Tom Teman said the venture capital climate changed dramatically in 2020, a sentiment echoed by veterans across the industry, that investors are increasingly demanding revenue from the start.      (After publication of this article, Teman told CoinDesk that The Block had it wrong: only four staffers, including Radotzki, were let go, he said.)      Yet, a former Portis competitor, Fortmatic CEO Sean Li, said his user-friendly login startup isn’t taking ShapeShift’s approach because he doesn’t “think any business should see themselves as a portal that owns everything in it.” As such his revenue model is business-to-business, rather than monetizing user activity. Li estimated nearly 5,000 developers now use Fortmatic for gateways to their various projects, so his early-stage startup is still on track to make more than $500,000 in revenue this year.      “This prevents the next Facebook or Google situation where one account is associated with a lot of different applications, compromising user security and privacy,” Li said.      On the other hand, Casa CEO Nick Neuman said his subscription-based startup saw an “influx of new clients” since the beginning of March, with a 50% increase in bitcoin secured with Casa wallets. Like Unchained Capital and other subscription startups above, Casa is primarily focused on bitcoin.      “We’re definitely seeing increased demand for self-custody since the coronavirus crisis began,” Neuman said.

42431836,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6uHh,1588263424,ICE Spent 'Nearly $300M' Helping Bakkt Acquire Loyalty Firm Bridge2,"Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company to Bakkt, spent close to $300 million helping the bitcoin warehouse acquire loyalty rewards provider Bridge2 Solutions, CEO Jeffrey Sprecher said Thursday.      The revelation came during a discussion of the financial strength of ICE, the parent company to several major trading venues, include the New York Stock Exchange.      Sprecher said during ICE's Q1 earnings call the company had ""opportunistically repurchased shares,"" spending $300 million at $92 per share during the quarter while maintaining the company's leverage, measured as the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA).      ""We also spent nearly $300 million helping Bakkt to acquire Bridge2 solutions,"" Sprecher said. ""Yet, our leverage was still at 2.3 times which is a complete testament to the strength of the cash flows of this business.""      Bakkt announced it would acquire Bridge2 in February, while simultaneously raising a $300 million Series B funding round. The round closed last month, as did the acquisition. The terms of the deal were outlined in ICE's quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, also released Thursday.      See Also: Bakkt Raises $300M Series B From Microsoft, Pantera      It's unclear whether the $300 million represents the total sum of the acquisition or how much came from Bakkt's Series B funders, which include Microsoft's M12, PayU, Boston Consulting Group, Goldfinch Partners, CMT Digital and Pantera Capital. The company did say in its February press release that some of the funds from the round would go toward the acquisition.    Rapid change    Aside from two references to Bridge2, Bakkt was not mentioned during the earnings call. No analysts asked any direct questions about the subsidiary, which has been facilitating trading of bitcoin futures and options contracts over the past several months.      Nor were there any questions about Mike Blandina, who stepped down as Bakkt's CEO last week just four months after taking the reins. Blandina was succeeded on an interim basis by ICE's vice president for M&A and integration, David Clifton. There has so far been no word a permanent replacement CEO.      The lack of questions comes in stark contrast to ICE's last earnings call in February, when a number of analysts asked about ICE's role with Bakkt. That call came right after ICE announced it was acquiring Bridge2, and Sprecher said at the time the move could open a potential $1 trillion market.      Bakkt is working on its consumer-focused app. The company has rolled out an integration with Starbucks, allowing some of the coffee chain's app users to pay for caffeine using ""Bakkt Cash.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/30/ice-spent-nearly-300m-helping-bakkt-acquire-loyalty-firm-bridge2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca9b2a4236d3b64cddb157ea18300e69cd1b587a-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The limit, which has been changed from $100,000 to $1 million, represents a ten-fold increase resulting from growing investor demand in digital assets, the exchange says.      It comes at a time when bitcoin's continuous rally from its March 13 ""Black Thursday"" low of $3,850 saw prices reach as high as $9,463 on Thursday.      ""After being extremely undervalued throughout the greater part of March, bitcoin has made a full recovery in just one and a half months,"" Jonathan Leong CEO and co-founder of BTSE told CoinDesk. ""Approaching the halving, I see the outlook as very bullish.""      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      An RFQ is a trading system or tool used to overcome issues of price slippage. Put simply RFQ is an electronic real-time message sent to liquidity providers connecting interested buyers or sellers.

But to boost adoption, that might be the wrong trend.      So says Carlos Acevedo, director of sales and the regional lead of Latin America for Brave, the crypto-powered web browser. In this episode of CoinDesk Live, hosted by Consensus organizer Stephanie Izquieta, Acevedo seemed to invoke the giving nature of early bitcoin enthusiasts such as Roger Ver, who would give away bitcoin to anyone and everyone he met.      According to Acevedo, that’s the best way to get more people interested in the technology. They’ll not only be interested from a price perspective but become more curious about how crypto could offer efficiencies and benefits in other areas of their life.      For people in lower-income communities that are unbanked or underbanked, it’s introducing a whole new concept of finance they didn’t have access to before.      “The movement is so small but so, so powerful,” Acevedo said.

The New York-based firm now provides its secure transfer services to major Asian crypto firms including trading platform Amber, investment firm Blitz Group and hedge fund Three Arrow Capital, Michael Shaulov, CEO and co-founder of Fireblocks, told CoinDesk.      “With the region’s unique ecosystem of trading, payment and exchange activities, there has been a surge in demand in Asia,” Shaulov said.      Stephen Richardson, Fireblocks’ vice president of product strategy in Singapore, and Amy Zhang, its vice president of sales in Hong Kong, will be responsible for customer service and onboarding institutions and exchanges.      Founded in 2018, the firm received $16 million in funding last June through a Series A round from Cyberstarts, Tenaya Capital and Eight Roads, the proprietary investment arm of Fidelity International.      According to Fireblocks, it has sold its services to more than 22 different exchanges for handling 180 different cryptocurrencies. Clients include B2C2, Celsius, Genesis Global Trading, Galaxy Digital, Woorton, Dunamis, GSR, Blockfills, LGO and Nexo. Genesis Global Trading, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.      The firm claims it has protected $30 billion in digital asset transfers to date with its patented multi-party computation (MPC) technology. MPC ensures there is no single point of failure and is compatible with a wider range of cryptocurrency protocols than multi-signature technology, according to Fireblocks.      Read more:MPC Explained: The Bold New Vision for Securing Crypto Money      Another advantage of its MPC technology is its low cost, the firm said.      “Multiple wallets based on multi-sig are associated with higher fees than regular, single address transactions,” Shaulov said. “MPC-based wallets, however, are represented on the blockchain as a single wallet address, with the actual distributed signature computed outside of the blockchain.”      “This translates into having the lowest fees possible for the transaction and can be critical when issuing hundreds of transactions per day, especially in [business-to-consumer] applications,” he added.      The firm calls its service a ""hot vault,"" implying that it combines the convenience of so-called hot wallets connected to the internet with the security of offline cold storage.

The move comes as the Props project seeks higher throughput for its continued expansion, according to an announcement Thursday.      Props said it has now raised $2 million in a funding round led by Union Square Ventures (USV) and Borderless Capital that will fund the chain migration. GSR, Lvna Capital, CoinFund, and the Dating.com Group also invested.      Props, which has now been spun-out of YouNow, hopes the shift to Algorand will allow it to better scale. Unveiled in 2017 as a way for users to support content creators, some independent projects – such as Listia earlier this year – have moved onto the PropsChain, citing its functionality and large network of users.      Props co-founder Adi Sideman told CoinDesk the number of users has tripled to more than three million since January. With a new Dating.com integration, the company expects its user base could grow to as many as five million users by May.      The current sidechain, which is on ethereum, ""would have difficulties supporting the scale Props is set to reach and required continuous maintenance,"" Sideman said. ""Algorand provides an out-of-the-box solution that handles the usage level and relieves the Props team from the need to maintain a chain themselves.""      The migration also means Props can dispense with its own network validators and rely instead on the larger pool of stakers that validate the Algorand public chain.      See also: Two Social Networks Announce Plans to Integrate YouNow’s Props Token      Props hit the headlines after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted the project a Reg A + sale qualification last July, giving it the regulatory green light to raise a maximum of $50 million from retail investors.      The news is the latest in a series of positive developments for Algorand, which has been attracting notable crypto and blockchain projects interested in leveraging the chain's high throughput potential.      Monerium, an Icelandic settlements provider with a European Union e-money license, said it had formed a partnership with Algorand back in January to see if fiat currency transactions can be moved onto the blockchain to create cost savings.      The Marshallese central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative is also built on top of Algorand. The project's technology provider told CoinDesk at the time that Algorand had the tech stack needed to facilitate fast and secure payments on an everyday basis.      See also: Blockstack Ran on Token Sales in 2019, Says Latest SEC Filing      As it looks to capitalize on its momentum, the Algorand Foundation announced just over two weeks ago it was setting aside $50 million worth of Algos, the protocol's native token, for a new fund to finance ecosystem development.      It isn't clear whether Props is still planning on raising money through the retail investor route. A spokesperson said that they could offer tokens in a public sale, under a Reg A, sometime in the future.

Announced Thursday, Chainlink’s decentralized pricing oracles will provide real-time data for Tezos community projects after teaming up with Smart Chain Arena and Cryptonomic, a pair of independent Tezos developers.      The integration means Tezos projects can pull from active pricing feeds for various assets to build out products, such as the bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi) application recently created by the Bitcoin Association Switzerland.      Read more: Wrapped Bitcoin Aims to Kick-Start DeFi on Tezos Blockchain      Pricing oracles like Chainlink provide the infrastructure necessary for scaling digital-asset products, especially in the DeFi space. Digital assets are sold on various secondary markets, making price discovery inherently difficult.      Oracle solutions like Chainlink organize and vet price feeds from on- and off-chain sources to construct a reliable price average. The firm’s oracles have been integrated in various forms into Google, Oracle and SWIFT plus cryptocurrency projects such as bZx, Polkadot and crypto lending giant Celsius Network.      Smart Chain Arena and Cryptonomic are two firms in the greater Tezos ecosystem. The former firm produced the SmartPy language, which will be used for crafting the smart contracts necessary to deploy Chainlink’s oracles.      “We recommend Tezos developers use Chainlink when building smart contracts as Chainlink’s secure decentralized oracle network makes possible a plethora of new use cases across DeFi, Equities, Insurance, and much more,” Cryptonomic co-founder Vishakh said in a statement.    Sergey speaks    Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazarov told CoinDesk in a phone interview that many firms are switching to contracted oracle solutions due to the inherent difficulties of building a decentralized pricing feed.      Nazarov said the undertaking is similar to making an entirely new blockchain itself.

42404590,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdix09,1588251600,Genesis CEO Details 'Black Thursday' Chaos in Q1 Lending Report,"Genesis, a trading firm that also lends to institutional cryptocurrency investors, has provided a behind-the-scenes look at how staffers scrambled to meet client demands as the spread of coronavirus sent bitcoin prices swooning last month.      As described in its latest quarterly lending report on Thursday, the peak of the drama came on March 12 when bitcoin tumbled 39% – its biggest loss on a single day in seven years. Cryptocurrency lenders and futures exchanges scrambled to protect themselves from losses, firing off a flurry of margin calls, in which traders are asked to post additional collateral against trading loans and derivatives contracts.      “Over that 24-hour period, there were certain counterparties that got pinged three to four times,” Genesis CEO Michael Moro said in an interview. “With the way the price kept falling, you almost had to margin call them again an hour later.” Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.      Over the course of the first quarter, Genesis managed to increase its book of active trading loans by 19% to $649 million, according to the report. But it wasn’t without considerable volatility: The loan book started the year at $545 million and had nearly doubled to $1 billion in mid-February before the rapid deleveraging in March.      In early March, the brutal death toll and economic devastation of the coronavirus was only beginning to dawn on traders of both digital assets and traditional Wall Street securities like stocks and bonds.      “We didn't know how bad the equities market was going to get,” Moro said. “We didn't know how long this sell-off and turbulence was going to last.”    Eye of the storm    “Black Thursday,” as March 12 is now known among cryptocurrency traders, started out inauspiciously enough. Bitcoin was trading around $7,900 – off of February’s highs around $10,000, but still safely above the year-end 2019 price around $7,170.      Moro said he headed out of the company’s New York City headquarters in downtown Manhattan to deliver a presentation to a private wealth management office. As he was speaking participants at the meeting started glancing at their smartphones, checking bitcoin prices and giving Moro up-to-the-minute market updates.      They wanted to know why bitcoin price was falling. And it was no ordinary drop, dipping first below $7,000, then sliding to $6,000, then to $5,000.      Read more: Bitcoin Falls Below $5K as Market Pain Deepens      “I’m up there talking, answering their questions, and then at some point people were just fixating on the price of bitcoin on their phones,” said Moro, 42.      He hustled back to the office, where employees were busy dealing with the deluge of margin calls.      The firm’s clients, mostly institutional traders, were all able to post the required collateral on trading loans, avoiding forced liquidations of their trading positions, Moro said.      The anxiety mounted, however: The additional collateral sent by clients was taking far longer than usual to arrive. According to Moro, the bitcoin network was so congested due to the heavy traffic that day that collateral postings got backed up.      “Transactions that usually take 10 minutes might have taken a couple hours,” Moro said.      Genesis staff also hurried to satisfy trading customers’ rapidly shifting financing needs.      Bitcoin futures contracts that usually trade at a premium to the daily market price suddenly swung to a discount. Traders quickly adjusted their strategies, and Genesis suddenly started seeing a flood of clients returning dollar loans and asking for new loans denominated in bitcoin.      “Thankfully we had no losses,” Moro said, “other than a really busy and stressful day.”      Read more: Bitcoin Price Briefly Dips to 12-Month Low in Overnight Trading      For most Genesis employees, it was their last day in the office for a long time: On March 13, the company transitioned to working remotely.      Genesis also tightened its lending policies after March 12, halting new loans for at least a week if they weren’t fully collateralized, Moro said.      “I just didn't want that risk on the Genesis balance sheet,” Moro said. “After we felt like markets had calmed down, we reopened the dialogue and restarted the origination machine.”      Volatility is the norm in crypto markets. Just not this much volatility.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/30/genesis-ceo-details-black-thursday-chaos-in-q1-lending-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c589546c21e5b8a3fd5e0cf46ce796b0c34f04d-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404593,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdix45,1588251000,Shares in Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust Up By 14% After Crypto's Price Rallies,"Amid the sharp rise in bitcoin's price Wednesday, shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) also saw notable gains.      Bitcoin's sudden rally – which many analysts are associating with expectations around the coming miner reward halving event – helped propel the investment vehicle to a 14.3% gain on the day, with a market price per share at $9.60 at the session close.      Grayscale's Ethereum Trust has also seen a significant increased, up 7.7% to $104.50 per share. Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.      See also: Bitcoin Jumps 12% as Fed Keeps Money Flowing and US Economy Shrinks      The trust's share prices continue to profit from investor sentiment driven by a fear of missing out (FOMO) amid bitcoin's recent rallies on the back of this year's halving, scheduled for May 12. The supply cutting event will reduce the rewards given to bitcoin miners per block mined by half.      At time of writing, bitcoin is changing hands for around $8,948 and is up over 130% from the crash witnessed March 12 and 13, when prices bottomed at below $4,000. Prices peaked at over $9,400 in the early hours of Thursday.      Further, the firm's total net assets under management (UAM), which include top-10 cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP), have now topped $3 billion, according to the latest tweet from institutional investment firm.      It's worth noting the pricing used to determine the total AUM was based on the private placement offering price, or the sale of shares sold to pre-selected investors or institutions, and was calculated using a non-GAAP methodology.      Other Grayscale investment vehicles that have benefited on the back of the wider crypto market rise include the XRP Trust, up 8;, the Litecoin Trust, up 6.6%; and the Digital Large Cap Fund, up 7.5%.      The trusts, targeted towards institutional investors, have their prices quoted on the OTCQX marketplace.      OTCQX is designed for both U.S. and international companies that must meet stringent financial standards to qualify for a stake in a fund. Interested companies also need to be compliant with U.S. securities laws and up-to-date in their disclosures. Penny stocks and shell companies cannot qualify for a OTCQX listing.      As seen in the chart above, GBTC fell short of climbing above the 200-day moving average (MA) at around $10.31 per share. The MA represents a significant level for investors looking to see a continuation from March 16 lows of around $5.01.      GBTC is currently up 91% from those lows and will likely see further gains should bitcoin continue its phenomenal April 29-30 rally. As seen on the chart, total daily volume is now also significantly higher than at the end of 2019.

42404596,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdix54,1588246375,First Mover: Bitcoin Now Crushing Gold After Biggest Price Jump in Six Weeks,"Bitcoin has lagged gold this year as investors looked for hedges against inflation – especially with the Federal Reserve creating trillions of dollars of fresh money to offset the devastating economic and market toll of the coronavirus.      Not anymore.      The oldest cryptocurrency jumped 13% on Wednesday, the most in six weeks, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell promised an ""unlimited pot"" of money to keep the U.S. economy from collapsing.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Bitcoin is now trading at roughly $8,860, for a year-to-date gain of 24%.      Gold, a symbol of riches and monetary stability at least since the Sumerians civilized Mesopotamia, is up just 13% in 2020. And the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks is still negative on the year, down 9%.      Over the span of April, bitcoin has succeeded in reclaiming its status as one of the world's best-performing assets, following a 94% return in 2019 that was three times the gains in the S&P 500.      Just the bragging rights alone might attract more bitcoin buyers, at a time when central bank money injections are already starting to attract the interest of a broader swath of investors.      ""Investors for years were just kind of scratching the surface of bitcoin and crypto,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital in San Francisco, said Wednesday in a phone interview. ""Now there's been this seismic shift in the investor community, which is that they know what it is and increasingly understand the proposition of bitcoin as a deflationary asset, versus the dollar as an inflationary asset.""      It would be hard to argue that the cryptocurrency's performance through the first four months of the year isn't remarkable, given the backdrop of the global pandemic and the fact that the digital asset was concocted by computer programmers just 11 years ago.      Wednesday's move up looked powerful, too: Bitcoin blew past price points that charting analysts had tagged as resistance levels, such as the 100-day and 200-day moving averages of the cryptocurrency's price.      Delphi Digital's Kevin Kelly noted in a report later in the day that bitcoin's volatility can be friend or foe: ""We must be prepared to face its ugly twin eventually.""      In the meantime, the year-to-date title puts bitcoin in a better position to capitalize on the marketing bonanza sure to come from the cryptocurrency's once-every-four-years ""halving,"" now fewer than two weeks away.      The halving, in which the pace of new issuance of bitcoins gets cut in half, was hard-coded into the Bitcoin blockchain's original programming as a way of limiting inflation. Ultimately, no more than 21 million bitcoins can ever be minted.      Mark Warner, head of trading for London-based BCB Group, a financial firm focused on digital assets, said in an email that Wednesday's rally was likely fueled by enthusiasm over the halving.      ""The jockeying for position ahead of the halving is now starting,"" Rich Rosenblum, a former Goldman Sachs managing director who now leads the markets group at the digital-asset trading firm GSR, wrote in an email.      For now, the digital gold, not the yellow metal, appears to be the favored horse.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $8,8783 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,469 | 24-Hr Low: $8,111      Trend: Bitcoin has pulled back from two-month highs above $9,400 hit early on Thursday, confirming signs of buyer exhaustion on the intraday technical charts.      The hourly chart is now reporting a bearish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI), which occurs when an indicator forms a lower high, contradicting a higher high on price.      Further, the current four-hour candle is flashing red and validating the preceding spinning top candle – signaling a weakening of upward momentum.      As a result, the cryptocurrency may consolidate for the next day or so. That said, most analysts expect bitcoin to continue rising toward $10,000 ahead of the mining reward halving, scheduled to take effect on May 12.      ""While bitcoin miners are choosing to hold, the number of actual participants in the market is hitting new highs amid the expectation that this halving event will play out like the last one and push the price up sharply,"" said Simon Peters, an analyst and crypto asset expert at investment platform eToro. ""With these tailwinds in place, we think it is likely the price will go above $10,000 before the halving actually takes place.""      From a technical standpoint, the probability of bitcoin testing five figures in the next 12 days would weaken if the spot price finds acceptance under the 200-day average at $8,000.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/30/first-mover-bitcoin-now-crushing-gold-after-biggest-price-jump-in-six-weeks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7ae60e933c934a5751d2ea9af0e725409b3aecd-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404582,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiwwD,1588243284,Older Mining Machines Turn Profitable Again as Bitcoin Rises Ahead of Halving,"With bitcoin's price jumping to a two-month high above $9,000, even mining equipment thought obsolete is becoming profitable again, at least for a short time.      According to the miner profitability index, tracked by mining pools PoolIn and F2Pool, older mining rigs, such as Bitmain's AntMiner S9 or Canaan's Avalon A851, can now generate a 10% to 20% gross margin at an average electricity cost of $0.05 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).      For those that have adopted miner efficiency improvement methods, such as merging two S9s into one or lowering voltage to boost efficiency, gross margin could increase to as much as 30% to 40% at bitcoin's current price.      And as CoinDesk reported earlier this week, the upcoming rainy season in China – which is estimated to account for 70% of bitcoin's total mining power – brings excessive hydropower that will result in electricity costs going under 3 cents per kWh.      Should bitcoin's price and mining difficulty remain constant, older generation mining models like the S9s could remain marginally profitable at these utility rates even after the halving takes the daily number of newly mined bitcoin down from 1,800 to 900 units.      Meanwhile, major manufacturers' flagship machines including Bitmain's AntMiner S17 and S19 series as well as MicroBT's WhatsMiner M20 and M30 series can bring returns of over 60%, even at an average 5 cents per kWh utility cost.      ""Today's price movement would bring back even those miners that were recently disconnected due to profitability concerns,"" said Dmitrii Ushakov, chief commercial officer of Russia-based miner hosting firm BitRiver. ""After halving, we believe that the price range of 3 to 4 cents [USD] is sufficient to continue mining profitably with S9 miners if the current price movement continues.""      Read also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Following bitcoin's price crash on March 12, its worst sell-off in seven years, a wide range of older mining rigs have been forced to unplug from the network, resulting in a 16% mining competition drop in late March.      The mining competition drop, together with bitcoin's price rebound after March 12, initially helped older miners become marginally profitable. As a result, Bitcoin's total hash rate climbed to a near all-time-high of 110 exahashes per second (EH/s) over the past several weeks.      But during the same period, bitcoin's price stagnated around $7,000 for weeks, which put pressure on farms relying on older models ahead of the halving and cooled the purchasing spree for more powerful and top-of-the-line equipment at large scales.      That said, bitcoin mining is a dynamically changing game. As bitcoin's halving approaches in under two weeks, those relying on older mining equipment, without access to cheap electricity resources, face being squeezed out by those running efficient operations.      Read also: Price Drop Casts Pall Over Bitcoin Miners’ Equipment Upgrades      Mining farm operators previously estimated that older models like the S9 accounted for around 20% of the bitcoin network's total computing power in March, which is a significant drop from a year ago because major players have been replacing these older models with more powerful new equipment during late 2019.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/30/older-mining-machines-turn-profitable-again-as-bitcoin-rises-ahead-of-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acd5d6c9ad1958f05126537cc9de7e3d77c7ee42-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404591,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdix36,1588241772,Bitcoin Options Trading Volumes Surge as Price Moves Above $9.4K,"Bitcoin jumped to two-month highs early on Thursday and now looks set to register its biggest monthly gain in nearly a year.      The top cryptocurrency by market value rose to $9,469 at 06:05 UTC, the highest level since Feb. 25, having rallied from $7,700 to $8,900 on Wednesday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      At press time, the cryptocurrency had dropped back to around $8,750, still up more than 36 percent on a month-to-date basis. That is the biggest monthly gain since May 2019 when the cryptocurrency had rallied by 62 percent. It's now also up 22% on a year-to-date basis.      Bitcoin's big move higher has revived interest in options or derivative instruments used to hedge against sudden price swings.      Major exchanges – Deribit, LedgerX, Bakkt, OKEx, CME – registered a total trading volume of nearly $180 million on Wednesday to register a 350% rise from Tuesday's tally of $40 million, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      The volume witnessed on Wednesday was the highest since ""Black Thursday"" (March 12), when bitcoin fell by nearly 40% to levels below $5,000. Major exchanges registered a record trading volume of more than $280 million on the crash.      An option contract is an agreement between a buyer and seller that gives the purchaser of the option the right, but not obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option represents a right to buy, while a put option buyer has a right to sell.    Call options draw higher prices    The one-month put-call skew, which measures the price of puts relative to that of calls, has dropped below zero for the first time since March 26. ""The negative skew indicates calls are more expensive than puts,"" explained Darius Sit, co-founder and managing director at Singapore-based QCP Capital.      A week ago, put options were claiming higher prices than calls and the skew was hovering near 15%. Back then, demand for puts was higher, possibly due to fears of another macro-driven sell-off in cryptocurrencies.    Leverage-driven rally    While on-chain data suggests increased participation from small traders, the big rise seen in the last 24 hours looks to be a leverage-driven rally.      ""It is the leverage in the space that creates large moves,"" Sit told CoinDesk, while adding that a lot of traders who were short leveraged (holding short positions in futures or short call options) are now covering their positions.      Seasoned option traders usually write, or sell, call options when they expect the market to consolidate or drop. Note that bitcoin was largely stuck in $7,500 to $6,400 range in the two weeks to April 23. Additionally, many observers were worried about another sell-off in bitcoin.      As a result, investors may have sold call options or bought put options back then. The one-month skew was also reporting a bearish bias a week ago, as noted earlier.      With bitcoin's sudden move higher, these short positions in call options are likely being squared off, leading to an exaggerated price rise.      It's worth noting that selling options – whether put or call – is a limited profit, unlimited loss strategy.    Looking forward    Most analysts are of the opinion that the speculative buzz surrounding a bullish narrative around this month's mining reward halving event is driving the cryptocurrency higher and could push the cryptocurrency into five figures ahead of event, due May 12.      ""The sudden jump in bitcoin’s price to well over the $9,000 can be explained by the fact that bulls have been triggered by the upcoming halving event and the anticipated appreciation of BTC’s value in its aftermath. For those buying into bitcoin now, many see this as an opportunity to buy BTC at essentially discounted rates ahead of a post halving price increase,"" said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack.    Cautiously long bitcoin    QCP Capital is positioned for an extended bullish move in the medium term but is also hedged for a sudden collapse in prices. ""We remain core long BTC and short puts, but have now turned cautious on our spot holdings, while at the same time rolling our longer-tenor puts to a higher strike,"" Sit told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      To simplify, QCP is holding a long position, which faces the risk of a reversal lower. To protect against a potential downside move, the trading firm is also buying longer duration put options (bearish bets) of higher strike prices.      Being hedged long makes sense, as historical data shows the cryptocurrency fell after its previous halvings.

42404579,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiwrI,1588237200,Alibaba Patents Blockchain System That Spots Music Copycats,"Alibaba has patented a blockchain-based means of vetting the originality of songs.      Granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on April 21, the process as described by the Chinese e-commerce giant addresses one of the recording industry’s major issues – protecting the copyright of music tracks – by hosting and vetting that content on a blockchain.      One validation node and multiple music library nodes comprise the blockchain. The validation node performs “originality analysis” on a music track to evaluate how similar its tune, tempo and other factors such as lyrics and beat are to other tracks in the library.      This data is published to the blockchain and summarized in a second vetting report that also includes a similarity ratio. Ultimately, the process yields a recommendation on the track’s originality from a plurality of nodes.      Alibaba claims this method of song vetting could help stymie copycats whose meddling with the files skirts existing copyright safeguards, including hash coding music files to prove their authenticity, by stealing the sound itself.      See also: Alibaba Patents Would Secure, Accelerate Its Consortium Blockchain      “Currently, there is still no platform that can be used to perform a similarity analysis on musical works to identify plagiarized or imitated” songs, Alibaba wrote. That hole is wide enough for copycats to conceivably exploit.      Blockchain-based originality analysis can “alleviate” the problem, Alibaba said. It also universalizes the solution, as music libraries from around the world can all act as distributed nodes.      Alibaba envisions smart contracts running the originality reports in one iteration.      “The smart contract is executed with less human intervention and advantageous decentralized authority, and fairness of the music originality analysis behavior is further improved,” it said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/30/alibaba-patents-blockchain-system-that-spots-music-copycats,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac31e30cf8017ea2e430b03d806e8e5f459a5bb4-1420x917.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The public benefit corporation’s FY 2019 revenue – $23.3 million – came almost entirely from its Regulation A+ compliant token sale that raised over $23 million in September 2019, according to SEC filings Wednesday. Its 2017-2018 revenues came from exempted token sales, the filing showed.      Cash reserves entering 2020 totaled $18.6 million including a restricted $4.4 million that Blockstack unlocked by notching its millionth “Verified User” in January 2020. Blockstack’s definition and counting of verified users has been questioned in the past. Had Blockstack not hit the million mark it would have been compelled to return purchaser funds.      That metric milestone nevertheless granted Blockstack access to $2.4 million in additional crypto. Its full bitcoin and ether reserves vere valued at $7.8 million at the end of 2019.      Blockstack – which is building a decentralized network and app ecosystem for Web 3.0 – said in the filing it might liquidate some of those crypto assets to keep financing its existence. Fresh token sales are off the table, though.      “Blockstack does not expect to generate revenue from Stacks Token sales in the future,” save sales of the 110 million tokens already in its treasury, it said.      See also: Blockstack Pledges to Enforce Patents for ‘Defensive Purposes’ Only      The company thinks it will not have to treat its Stacks tokens as securities forever. Based on guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in April 2019, Blockstack said it believes the independence of its network will ultimately free blockstack from federal and state securities law reporting requirements because Stacks will no longer be considered a security.      Determination day may come later this year – either in Q2 or Q3 – with the release of Stacks Blockchain 2.0. At that time, the board of directors may reevaluate its stance on Stacks and the Howey test, according to the filing.      “We expect this determination to turn on whether the Blockstack network is sufficiently decentralized,” the filing said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/30/blockstack-ran-on-token-sales-in-2019-says-latest-sec-filing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/001ca3fa062723942267c8f0b94de417c4ee7f54-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404574,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiwoL,1588221452,"Telegram Caves to US Regulators: Delays Blockchain Launch, Offers to Return $1.2B to Investors","Messaging app Telegram postponed the launch of its TON blockchain for a second time on Wednesday, pushing the new go-live date to April 2021 and triggering a costly clawback clause in its agreement with token-sale investors.      According to a letter to investors obtained by CoinDesk, Telegram is offering to return up to 72% of each investor's stake. The terms were agreed upon when Telegram first postponed TON's launch in October, following a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charging Telegram with running an unregistered securities sale that raked in $1.7 billion in 2018. At the time, Telegram set a revised launch deadline of April 30, 2020.      The company lost an initial court battle with the SEC, with a U.S. judge ruling Telegram can't launch its blockchain or issue its forthcoming ""gram"" tokens until the case was resolved. On March 24, the initial preliminary injunction was left in place.      On Wednesday, however, Telegram floated another option for those investors who choose to forego their 72%: They can lend their investment to Telegram until this time next year.      The letter states: ""As a token of gratitude for your trust in TON, we are also offering you an alternative option to receive 110% of your original investment by April 30, 2021, which is 53% higher than the Termination Amount.""      Read more: Making Sense of the SEC’s Case Against Telegram      Telegram is ""continuing to engage in discussions with the relevant authorities,"" the letter continues. Depending on how the negotiations go, those investors could still receive ""grams or potentially another cryptocurrency on the same terms as those in their original Purchase Agreements.""      If regulators continue blocking the launch of TON, Telegram will repay the debt using equity. At present, the company is entirely owned by its founder and CEO, Pavel Durov. Citing Telegram's recent growth to 400 million monthly users, the company believes its ""equity value will exceed the aggregate amount of its potential debt resulting from this offer by at least several times.""      Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn told CoinDesk the investors won't get equity itself, but rather the proceeds from its possible future sale.      “Telegram may need to sell some equity later to get the money to repay the loan, but repayment in equity was not offered as an option,"" he wrote in an email.    Investor upside?    Sergey Solonin, the founder of payment processing firm QIWI and a $17 million investor in TON, said it's good news for investors.      ""The terms are really good, I think a lot of investors will choose to keep their money in Telegram,"" he said, citing the promise of additional returns.      ""There is definitely capital value there, and even if Telegram will ultimately not be allowed to issue grams, I think, in the course of this year [it] can find an investor and pay the money back [to the token purchasers],"" Solonin said.      Two fund managers told CoinDesk last week that many investors, especially the Silicon Valley venture funds, would prefer to have their token allocations converted into Telegram shares. For some VCs, the tokens have essentially been a proxy for Telegram’s equity, which the company was previously unwilling to sell. Selling equity had been not an option for Durov, they said.      After the March 24 ruling, Telegram went completely silent, making no communications with TON investors until the eleventh hour, according to several investors.    Almost launched    According to several sources close to the Telegram team, the company had been planning to launch the project just days before the final decision to postpone.      On Tuesday, fresh commits had been added to the Telegram Open Network (TON) repository on GitHub, including new documentation on running validator nodes.      Also around that time, the website ton.org went online, duplicating the information earlier published on test.ton.org, which contained code for the TON testnet. Meanwhile, TON Labs, a tech partner of Telegram that helped build the testnet, announced TON OS, ""an end-to-end open source infrastructure designed to enable developers and users to work with TON blockchain.""      Read more: Telegram Ruling Closes Another Door to Legally Compliant Token Sales      Several companies have been also planning to support TON and its tokens at launch, which, they believed was about to happen earlier this week, the sources told CoinDesk. Seychelles-based Poloniex published an intriguing tweet Wednesday night announcing ""new listings"" with Telegram's signature paper plane icon.      However, according to Carlton Fields attorney Andrew Hinkes, doing so could have drawn additional ire from the U.S. courts. By launching, Telegram would have violated its injunction, which could lead to the judge appointing a receiver or external manager for the company.      ""If the Court finds that the injunction was violated (whether intentionally or otherwise) it has broad discretion to fashion a remedy that would either coerce compliance or compensate the party seeking to enforce the injunction, including fines and incarceration,"" Hinkes said, though he noted the receiver appointment would be difficult to enforce for a non-U.S. company.      In the meantime, some TON investors and developers launched a TON Community Foundation, an informal group that has been preparing to launch its own fork of TON in case Telegram wouldn't be able to do so.      The group launched its own testnet version in mid-April, becoming the third TON testnet to go live following those rolled out by Telegram itself and TON Labs.

42404577,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiwpK,1588212540,Ousted Bitmain Co-Founder Wins Partial Victory in Latest Legal Battle,"Micree Ketuan Zhan, the ousted co-founder and former chairman of leading bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer Bitmain, has scored a partial legal victory over his former employer.      The Beijing Haidian District Bureau of Justice on Tuesday granted Zhan’s request to block the company from registering CFO Luyao Liu as the legal representative of its Beijing branch, Bitmain said. CEO Jihan Wu is currently the registered representative, and Bitmain said it wanted to switch the registration to Liu to improve efficiency.      The bureau had approved the registration switch on Jan. 2, but Zhan appealed the decision in February and asked the bureau to register him as the legal representative, a title he once held, instead.      While the bureau did not register Zhan as the legal representative, its reversal of the change from Wu to Liu could be significant. In China, naming a legal representative is much more than a formality; usually the chairman or CEO, this person has broad powers to act on a company’s behalf.      “We deeply regret the decision and think the bureau has violated corporate laws, and our company’s autonomy via administrative measures,” Bitmain said in a statement the same day. Hong Kong-based Bitmain Technologies Limited, whose CEO is Wu, has the right to change its legal representative since it is the Beijing subsidiary’s sole shareholder, the company said.      “We will file a lawsuit against the bureau to protect our company, shareholders and employees,” the company said in the statement.      Read more: How Was It Possible for Bitmain to Oust Its Largest Shareholder Overnight?    Ongoing struggle    The legal dispute is the latest chapter in Zhan’s ongoing struggle with Bitmain since his departure plotted by his fellow co-founder Wu last October. The two executives had sparred over various management issues as early as 2015.      Two months after Zhan was exiled from Bitcoin, he filed a legal case in the Cayman Islands, where Bitmain’s parent holding entity is registered. He asked a court to void a decision allegedly passed at a shareholder meeting that significantly curtailed his voting power.      In March, Zhan filed another lawsuit, this time in China, against Bitmain’s fully-owned subsidiary Fujian Zhanhua Intelligence Technologies and Beijing Bitmain Technologies as a related third party. The local court said the case was a dispute over “shareholder qualification confirmation” without giving further details.      In the latest statement, Bitmain also accuses Zhan of disrupting daily business by drawing crowds close to the company’s offices, posing as its legal representative to transfer assets and sign contracts, dividing and threatening employees with false information and smearing the management team through media coverage.      A week before Zhan’s departure and the revelation of Bitmain’s internal power struggle, the company confidentially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public. The application appears to be still in process.      Bitmain’s competitor Canaan Creative went public in the U.S. last December, while another major Chinese miner maker Ebang filed with the SEC for a $100 million initial public offering this week.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/30/ousted-bitmain-co-founder-wins-partial-victory-in-latest-legal-battle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c63939f0772576e117fc29709aa51d266b5d90d-1400x932.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
