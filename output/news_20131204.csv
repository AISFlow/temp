42425178,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv8Dh,1386183934,Bitcoin Scammers Held by Chinese Authorities,"Chinese authorities have detained three individuals in connection with the demise of bitcoin trading platform GBL.  At one point, GBL was the fourth biggest exchange in mainland China, however, in late October it vanished overnight, along with an estimated $4.1m invested by thousands of unsuspecting users.  It didn't take long for Chinese investigators to catch up with the fraudsters and their alleged ringleader, Liu, a 29-year-old man who was arrested in Zheijang Province.  Two other suspects were detained in November. One is a 24-year-old who was apparently responsible for GBL’s daily operations. The other is a 33-year-old named Huang, who took care of the financial aspects of the business, reports NZ Week.  It remains unclear how much money was traded on GBL's platform. Local press puts the figure at ¥25m (or close to $4.1m).  The first sign that GBL was not what it appeared came on 26th October, when users could not access their accounts and the platform appeared defunct. The team behind the site vanished without a trace and all attempts to reach them proved futile.  The address listed on GBL's website was fake. By the time the users realised what had happened, it was far too late.  To add to the confusion, a message was posted on the site, implying that it had been taken down by hackers. However, users soon realised they were dealing with a scam rather than a security breach and notified the authorities.  There were telltale signs that the exchange was not a legitimate operation, even before it closed its doors. The platform went live on 27th May, claiming to be based in Hong Kong. In hindsight, we know that the address was fake, with the site's server located in Beijing rather than Hong Kong.  Furthermore, GBL tried to register in Hong Kong back in June, but it was never issued a license for financial services.  Due to the unregulated nature of the currency, authorities did not get involved earlier, as they had no legal grounds to start an investigation. This is true not only of China, but the rest of the world too.  The investors must also shoulder some of the blame. A few simple checks should have been enough to keep them from doing business with GBL. China already has several bitcoin trading platforms; the largest is BTC China, which trades an estimated 100,000 BTC each day.  So why would investors flock to GBL?  It appears GBL didn't have to do much to lure investors. Bitcoin trading in China is attracting plenty of new people hoping to cash in on the cryptocurrency's recent price surge. Many of these newcomers have little to no experience of dealing with bitcoin, which makes them vulnerable.  There are some cultural differences to consider, too. The average Chinese citizen is a lot more likely to save cash than a westerner and frugality is considered a virtue in traditional circles. It's easy to see why bitcoin is attracting a different demographic in China, compared to the US or Europe.

42425161,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHtelh,1386181252,Sales Surge for Electronics Firm After Bitcoin Black Friday,"Just over a week since Adafruit Industries announced you could pay for their products with bitcoin, the DIY electronics merchant has raked in tens-of-thousands of dollars in the cryptocurrency.  “We can say it’s in the multiple tens-of-thousands of USD,” Adafruit founder Limor Fried told CoinDesk.  The company's sales were boosted by Bitcoin Black Friday (bitcoin’s answer to the discount-shopping holiday that follows Thanksgiving), which generated a record day of transactions for bitcoin payment processor BitPay, the service Adafruit uses.  Furthermore, in a curious twist, at least one customer who decided to pay with bitcoin used the very same coins they mined using Adafruit’s bitcoin mining tutorial. Fried said:  “The coolest thing for us is a customer told us they made a bitcoin miner using our tutorial, mined coins and then spent them on Adafruit.”  The company first entered the bitcoin world six months ago with the PiMiner, a Raspberry Pi-powered bitcoin miner. From there, the decision to implement bitcoin payments was a natural progression for Adafruit's team.  “We all considered mining coins a fun math puzzle and hobby,” said Fried.  Volatility  Like other businesses that have adopted bitcoin payments, Adafruit was concerned by the volatility of the currency due to the risk of bitcoin's price plummeting shortly after a sale.  “The big challenge for us was how [to] sell physical goods with a ‘currency’ that changes so often,” said the entrepreneur.  BitPay  was crucial to solving that challenge, she said. The payments processor, which transacted a $1m order in October, does the currency exchange into dollars at the point of sale.  “We never touch the bitcoins, each day BitPay does a daily bank transfer in USD to us. This was perfect for us,” she added.  According to Fried, the most popular bitcoin purchase on Adafruit's website, which has over 1,600 products, is the humble Raspberry Pi model B.  “The average order [with bitcoins] is over $100. Many orders were over $1,000 and we have a few over $8,000. The most popular item people purchase with bitcoins is the Raspberry Pi model B,” she said.  Bitcoin frenzy  Bitcoin Black Friday  , bitcoin’s answer to the 'frenzied consumerism' that follows Thanksgiving celebrations in the US, returned for a second year in 2013. The day was set up by Jon Holmquist in retaliation to claims that bitcoin has been fuelled by speculation rather than its potential as a global payment system.  This argument was made rather forcefully in a recent Wired article that suggested bitcoin’s irreversibility was a “fatal flaw” that ensures it “won’t ever achieve widespread adoption as a currency”.  Bitcoin Black Friday saw a range of sites offer discounted products. Alongside BitPay's bigger merchants, it seems the deals at Adafruit won consumers over.  “During our recent Bitcoin Black Friday, Adafruit was one of our top selling merchants,” said Stephanie Wargo, VP of Marketing at BitPay.  BitPay processed just over 6,000 bitcoin transactions on Bitcoin Black Friday – up from just 99 during the inaugural event last year.  “The bitcoin space is growing each and every day; as more people acquire bitcoins, and more merchants accept them,” said Wargo.

42425158,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHtejh,1386169052,Unsuspecting PC Users Duped into Mining Bitcoin by Malware,"It seems malicious actors will find a way to infiltrate a user's system, no matter what. This is evident when one considers the allegations that bitcoin mining on unsuspecting users' PCs is increasingly prevalent.  A new report released by anti-malware software company Malwarebytes addressed this issue. It found that a number of Windows-based software applications are now mining small amounts of bitcoin on many machines, unbeknownst to their users.  The posts refers to “Potentially Unwanted Programs” (also known as 'PUPs'), which are applications such as browser toolbars and search programs. Many of these display advertising and slow computers to an excruciatingly slow speed.  Many of these PUPs are inadvertently downloaded by users who are trying to install other programs. Often, users don’t realise that the other programs are being put on their PCs during the install process.  Many end user license agreements (EULAs) allow for subsidiary programs to be installed. In fact, Malwarebytes has found that some EULAs include an explicit right for software to perform functions that sound suspiciously like virtual currency mining activities:  “As part of downloading a Mutual Public, your computer may do mathematical calculations for our affiliated networks to confirm transactions and increase security. Any rewards or fees collected by WBT or our affiliates are the sole property of WBT and our affiliates.”  The phrase “confirm transactions” can be generally attributed to the basic function of a bitcoin miner.  Malicious programs steal data from users, often sending it back to a source or a peer-to-peer network of 'zombie computers' known as botnets.  Now, it appears regular computers are being used to mine small amounts of bitcoin, which cannot be much per machine given that mining difficulty keeps increasing, but it could add up as bitcoin's price has skyrocketed.  The New Jersey Attorney General’s office recently fined a company called E-Sports Entertainment $1m after it admitted it had experimented with injecting bitcoin mining code into its users’ computers.  There are a few ways to remove these programs manually. One is to go through a computer’s programs list and uninstall anything that sounds unfamiliar.  Software like Malwarebytes is free to download and scans for malicious and more subversive programs that do not show themselves in an operating system’s programs list.  If anything else, consulting with an IT professional to make sure a computer is not running unnecessary software can be helpful and more time efficient.  Experts working in the bitcoin space recommend taking simple steps such as; researching programs before downloading; using different passwords for every program and website; plus, utilising tools like password managers.  “Do not reuse your passwords,” said Thomas Kerin, the lead developer behind the open source e-commerce platform BitWasp.

42425153,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHtedh,1386163559,Classified Ads Site Gumtree Blocks Bitcoin Listings,"Gumtree, the large international classifieds website and eBay subsidiary, is auto-removing bitcoin-related listings from its UK sites and has said bitcoin falls under its restricted items policy.  User Mark Le from Margate, Kent, reported that when he tried posting requests to buy bitcoins in Gumtree’s ‘Wanted’ section, he received the following message:    “Unfortunately we have had to remove your ad ""I will buy your Bitcoins"" posted in the category ""Miscellaneous"" from the site.      We believe that this ad is offering something that we do not accept on Gumtree.    To see the list of items that cannot be advertised on Gumtree please go to: Items Not Allowed on Gumtree. Thank you for your understanding.”    Oddly enough, he said this was after he had posted the original listing in the ‘Miscellaneous’ category by mistake and Gumtree actually advised him to place it in the more appropriate ‘Wanted’ category.  The listing was removed from Gumtree local sites in Kent and London, as well as from the general UK site. Eventually, Le posted it on the Gumtree South Africa site where it was accepted.  There is no specific reference to bitcoin on the ‘Items Not Allowed’ page, which refers mostly to illegal items and others that may incur the wrath of original sellers, like sports event tickets, Virgin Media Set boxes, and unlocked hardware.  Gumtree also bans ‘virtual merchandise and products’, but said this is ""mainly due to the licensing agreements in place with the providers of such products”.  CoinDesk's request for clarification from Gumtree received the following response:    ""Kindly note that Gumtree is a Classified website, and the company itself has regulated some policies that we do not allow to be advertised on our site.      Unfortunately as one of these regulations is that we do not allow any bitcoin advertisements to be posted, once such adverts are posted they will get automatically detected from the system itself and the advert will then be removed.    However I will still forward such feedback that you have provided so our development team will be able to have a look into this from their end. I do apologise for any inconvenience caused, and do feel free to get back to me if you require further more my assistance.""    No further reason for the decision to block bitcoin was given. This is despite recent positive comments by parent company eBay's CEO John Donahoe on bitcoin, saying there was no current plan to implement it as a payment option, but hinting he is interested in adding it at some point in the future. Ebay has also been known to remove some bitcoin-related ads if placed outside the correct category.  Update: Gumtree has since clarified that, while it doesn't allow bitcoin buying and selling ads under its 'virtual goods' policy, it is still happy to accept ads requesting payment by bitcoin.  Gumtree's history  Gumtree is an online classifieds and community site which started in London in 2000 as a service for local Australian, New Zealand and South African expats.  Now available in English and Polish, it has expanded over the past decade or so to cover several cities in over eight countries, including most English-speaking countries, as well as Italy, France, Germany, Hong Kong and Poland. It began operating in some US cities in 2007.  It claims to be the most popular classifieds site in the UK and was acquired by eBay’s classifieds group in 2005. The main page shows categories for over 1.7m listings including For Sale, Jobs, Services and Flats & Houses.  Gumtree may be extra wary of bitcoin due to its 2008 experience with fraudsters using Western Union money transfers to operate a rent scam. The criminals operated out of Nigeria, but as is the case with similar sites, like Craigslist, it has been used as a platform for a number of other scams relating to property renting.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/04/classified-ads-site-gumtree-blocks-bitcoin-listings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/386425e2442972a88f67c4f02afe5af7aec59fef-1000x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425147,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHteNh,1386156643,CoinDesk Investigates: Can Divorcees Hide Assets in Bitcoins?,"Could a divorcee hide their assets by squirrelling them away in bitcoin? A rogue poster on the Bitcoin Talk Forum raised the issue this week, so CoinDesk asked some lawyers.  According to the user on Bitcoin Talk, a man discovered that his wife cheated on him and decided to divorce her. However, before he did, he spent several weeks moving a large percentage of his assets into bitcoins, in an attempt to shield the assets. The post continues, saying:  “He just sprung the divorce on his ex-wife and now her lawyer is arguing he must have much more money than he claims to be. The judge ordered he must turn over all his assets to give one half to his ex-wife. Does the court have right of access to his bitcoin wallet?”  Commenters queried the validity of the original poster’s claim, based on her stated age and some of the claims made. And she subsequently replied to CoinDesk:    “Sorry to disappoint you, my post was a forum troll, like all my other posts in this forum.”      “But I am sure the same story has happened, or will happen in the near future.”    The debate on the forum was a heated one. The concept is clearly interesting, so CoinDesk took up the hypothetical issue with some attorneys.  Disclosure and enforcement  There are two separate questions here: firstly, should parties in a divorce be made to declare bitcoin assets, and secondly, if they are, then could they illicitly hide them and be free from enforcement? After all, bitcoin is supposed to be a way of storing value anonymously (if a person knows what they are doing).  It’s difficult to find a family lawyer specializing in bitcoin. Neither they nor a divorce court judge are likely to get the intricacies, said Greg Broiles, an attorney specializing in estate planning, trust and probate, who spoke on bitcoin and taxation at Bitcoin 2013:  “They’re not likely to understand the technical nuances, but I think they’ll understand that value exists, and has been hidden.”  He went on the say that family law courts are inherently practical.  Typically, parties in a divorce ask for disclosure of assets, and are expected to divulge their holdings honestly. Bitcoins would likely be eligible for disclosure, says Stuart Hoegner, a gaming lawyer with expertise in bitcoin, and general counsel for Canada’s Bitcoin Alliance.  Much depends on the jurisdiction in which the case plays out, however. Some US states carry a community property rule, where only assets acquired during a marriage are to be divided, while property owned before a marriage is considered an individual’s own.  The question, then, is whether someone in a divorce case would be able to hide their coins effectively (if illegally) from a soon-to-be ex-spouse?  Hiding money is nothing new, points out Hoegner:  “People have been burying money under rocks, putting money into safety deposit boxes, giving money to friends to hold on to, and saying that they have been gambling money away for a long time. I see bitcoin as an extension of those.""  If a counterparty’s lawyer believes that a disclosure is false, they will attempt to trace any extra funds, generally by demanding bank statements.  “We’d go back and look at the statements and then say ‘here’s where you transferred some money to Mt. Gox or Coinbase',” said Broiles. If the exchange had a US presence, they could demand records from that business.  One of the appealing things about bitcoin is its ability to quickly transfer funds to a destination out of US jurisdiction. That makes it difficult to retrieve those funds. A friend or other institution holding the funds outside the country would be harder to get the money back from.  In any case, it would be difficult to prove just who owned that money, after it was sent from a person’s bitcoin wallet to another address. Sometimes, judges will jail parties in a divorce suit until the money comes back, or until it can be proven that they have no control over that money.  That could backfire on anyone trying to hide assets from their spouse by transferring them to bitcoins. Broiles went on to say:  “It’s difficult to prove that someone has control of it. It’s also difficult to prove that someone doesn’t have control of it. I don’t think it’s a great approach.”  In general, it’s inadvisable to be dishonest with anyone in a divorce case (or anywhere else). Trying to squirrel away assets by hiding them in a virtual currency leaves people at risk of a perjury charge.  But even though this incident was little more than fictional fun from an online troll, we can expect to see real cases, warns Hoegner:  “We are going to have family law issues that crop up. We’re going to have estate issues, and people dying with substantial amounts of bitcoins. The question becomes, are they disposed of through the estate, or in another manner?”  In many countries, it isn’t yet clear whether bitcoin is a currency, a commodity, or another asset.

42425172,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHtexh,1386153270,Trezor to Ship Physical Bitcoin Wallets in January,"Hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor has confirmed it will deliver its first batch of wallets next month, following a successful crowdfunding campaign that began in June.  Trezor had previously promised to deliver its first orders in October, but delayed the fulfillment date to January after deciding to add more features.  Pavol Rusnak, Trezor's co-founder, revealed that pre-orders are now closed.  Rusnak and co-founder Marek Palatinus initially attempted to fund the development of their hardware wallet with a Kickstarter campaign. However, the duo abandoned the crowdfunding platform after ""long delays in communication"" with Kickstarter and ""additional conditions"" imposed on the project's page, according to a Trezor blog post.  Instead, the pair decided to solicit funds from the bitcoin community directly, via posting on reddit and other community sites.  On 21st November, a Trezor blog post announced that ""most of the initial costs"" had been covered by ""hundreds of enthusiasts"". Rusnak wouldn't give an exact figure on how much has been raised, nor how many people have contributed; adding only that the amount was ""enough to cover mass production costs"".  Pricing controversy  Trezor offered bitcoin enthusiasts two ways of supporting its crowdfunding campaign. Supporters could either pay 1 BTC for a standard Trezor unit with a plastic casing, or pay triple the price for the aluminium-clad metallic option.  As bitcoin's value has soared in the past two months, users have begun to question the wisdom of Trezor pricing its pre-orders in the cryptocurrency.  According to Mt Gox, a Trezor pre-order was worth, on average, $100 (US dollars) during the device's crowdfunding campaign period. However, bitcoin's value began to climb steeply in mid-October.  By the end of November, 1 BTC was worth around $1,100 (or more than 10 times the initial value) according to the CoinDesk BPI. Thus, a Trezor pre-order would cost either $1,100 or $3,300.  As a result, some redditors have expressed their discontent with Trezor's price. One user, for example, posted:  ""It was expensive then and it's f***ing over-priced now. [Trezor] should honestly give back some of the bitcoin to the people that gave them funding so early on.""  Another redditor posted:  ""The decision to have a fixed price [...] was a mistake because of the huge price changes in the value of a bitcoin.""  In response, Rusnak dismissed these comments as ""misguided"". When asked if he regretted setting pre-order prices at a flat bitcoin-denominated value, he replied: ""No.""  Trezor previously stated that it would price its pre-orders in bitcoin to support the bitcoin economy. He added: “You don't see people complaining on Kickstarter that they want their money back with interest.""  Rusnak also said that his firm's decision to end the crowdfunding campaign came in response to complaints about Trezor's price. He added:  ""We decided to stop [the crowdfunding campaign] in order to stop meaningless discussions about the Trezor pricing.""  Rusnak added that ""almost all"" the currency his firm collected from crowdfunding was ""immediately"" changed to fiat currency to pay for production costs.  Trezor alternatives  Trezor is the latest nascent hardware wallet designed for the bitcoin community. However, as it stands, hardware wallets are not in common use.  One benefit of a hardware wallet is the fact that it isn't connected to the internet, thus greatly reducing its exposure to potential malefactors.  Redditors have suggested the YubiKey Neo as Trezor's best alternative. The YubiKey Neo is a contactless authentication key which redditors claim can be programmed to offer the same functionality as Trezor.  Rusnak and Palatinus also run several other well-known bitcoin projects. Rusnak started CoinMap, a crowdsourced map of real-world merchants who accept bitcoin payments.  Palatinus runs Slush's Pool, a bitcoin mining 'pool' that lets users work together to mine bitcoins and distribute the proceeds among themselves.  Rusnak said that he and Palatinus are in the process of forming a new company, SatoshiLabs, that will act as an umbrella organisation for all their bitcoin projects, including Trezor, Slush's Pool and CoinMap.
