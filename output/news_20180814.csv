42429519,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzQhh,1534289452,"Venezuela to Peg Pension, Salary Systems to Petro Cryptocurrency","Venezuela is set to begin using its ""petro"" cryptocurrency as an official accounting unit, according to the country's president.  ABC International reported the development on Tuesday, citing a televised announcement by President Nicolas Maduro, who first unveiled the petro back in December. As part of the change, the state oil and gas company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) will reportedly begin using the petro as a mandatory accounting unit.  The moves come as Venezuela's government seeks to combat growing economic turmoil by relaxing its currency controls, according to an August 7 report from CNBC. On August 20, for example, the government will seek to revalue its currency, the bolivar, and create a ""sovereign bolivar.""  In turn, the central bank will begin publishing the price of the sovereign bolivar as it relates to the petro ""and the price of the petro according to international currencies,"" ABC reports. Similar moves will see the country's salary and pension systems tied to the petro's value.  Since its debut, the petro has proven to be highly controversial, drawing attacks from opposition politicians within Venezuela as well as those in the U.S and abroad.  In March, the Trump administration barred U.S. citizens from transacting in the petro as part of a series of new sanctions against the South American country.

42429520,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzQbh,1534278652,Playboy Files Fraud Lawsuit Against Blockchain Startup,"Adult entertainment publisher Playboy is suing a Canadian blockchain startup for fraud and breaching a contract the two companies signed earlier this year.  According to a lawsuit filed in early August with the Los Angeles Superior Court, Playboy and Global Blockchain Technologies (GBT) signed a memorandum of understanding in March stating that GBT would help Playboy integrate the Vice Industry Token (VIT) onto its platforms.  Playboy planned to use the token to reward its audience for watching videos, writing comments and voting on content.  At the time, Playboy also announced a token sale, saying it would introduce a cryptocurrency wallet on the company's websites to support various coins for users to spend and earn. In May, GBT also announced it was working with Playboy Enterprises Inc. to integrate the digital wallet for VIT into the Playboy.tv portal.  Under the agreement, GBT was expected to provide technical support ""at no cost"" for Playboy and pay the company $4 million to license the Playboy brand in its own promotional materials. The payment was due on July 16, the lawsuit said.  Further, GBT was supposed to purge any mentions of pornography from the Vice Industry Token's website and ""rebrand the VIT website as more generally video/entertainment-oriented.""  Playboy argued that GBT did not provide any services supporting the technology, rebranding the VIT site or pay the $4 million. However, GBT did use Playboy's brand to attract investors, falsely assuring them that all of the company's projects are ""on schedule,"" Playboy said.  Playboy did not specify what it was seeking in damages in the lawsuit.  GBT president Shidan Gouran told CoinDesk in an email that ""Playboy's allegations have no merit"" and that GBT has ""no problem"" defending itself ""vigorously against frivolous lawsuits,"" though he declined to provide any details on the current development status of the VIT wallet.

42429518,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzQfh,1534275015,The Code for an Anonymous Lightning Network is Now Live,"The lightning network is due for a privacy boost.  That's according to Dr. Ayo Akinyele, a computer scientist who has focused his efforts on building a zcash implementation of anonymous off-chain payment architecture called BOLT. And today that work was published on Github.  First conceived  by zcash founders Matthew Green and Ian Miers in 2016, the code is inspired by the bitcoin scaling solution, lightning network, and seeks to unlock high levels of transaction throughput while adding payment confidentiality.  ""The lightning network has solved the initial issue with scalability, and now that gives us the opportunity to deal with the privacy problem. That is the strength of the BOLT design,"" Akinyele told CoinDesk.  Using blind signatures and zero-knowledge proofs, BOLT obscures transactions, balances and sender and receiver identities. Plus, because it's built to function along with privacy-oriented cryptocurrency zcash, users can open a channel using shielded transactions, thereby anonymizing the initial connection to the network.  ""BOLT is one approach that could lead to very promising results for privacy, and I'm excited to be on the front line of pursuing that,"" Akinyele said.  Today's release allows for the ""bidirectional"" use case — or payment channels that can move funds back and forth between two participants.  In order to be activated on the cryptocurrency, new code would need to be added to the zcash repository, in what is called a ""soft fork"" — or a type of change that doesn't require all versions of the software to update.  Going forward, the team behind BOLT is hoping to follow a similar development plan to the lightning network itself — deploying it as an open testnet to allow users to battletest the software.  ""It would be awesome to deploy this, similar to what lightning had done, and allow people to test on the testnet and then gradually get toward the mainnet,"" Akinyele said.  And while the current release has been optimized for zcash, in the future, Akinyele plans to develop it as a privacy extension for the lightning network itself, telling CoinDesk:  ""The next step is to retrofit these properties to bitcoin and litecoin on the lightning network, probably as a shielded transaction option, similar to what zcash offers now.""  First steps and beyond  Speaking to CoinDesk, Akinyele said today's release marks a minimal sketch of BOLT's fundamental architecture.  ""This initial implementation is based on CL signatures and very standard techniques for blind signatures and zero-knowledge proofs, and so it is a very basic construction that has been well known to cryptographers for a couple of decades now,"" Akinyele said.  While that's very technical, simply it uses digital signature technology that's been around for some time and so is proven efficient. Yet, there's still work to expand some of the architecture's capabilities.  ""This first implementation is just a concrete implementation of one version of that architecture, though in the future BOLT could look very different,"" Akinyele said.  Still, it's technically viable to implement and requires minimal changes to zcash in order to get into the testing phase.  And crucially, having specified the initial architecture, it's easier to further iterate the protocol, as well as building support for other cryptocurrencies — the next significant step in the BOLT development roadmap.  As Akinyele told CoinDesk:  ""Now we have one approach implemented we can decide what is the next approach that we want to try and which cryptocurrency can it benefit.""  Cryptocurrencies that are similar in structure to zcash, such as bitcoin and litecoin, are low hanging fruit for such implementations.  Added privacy  Such additions would be applied to the lightning network itself, as an option for users looking to anonymize their payment channel usage.  ""It's a privacy add-on,"" Akinyele said.  And that's because, while lightning itself deploys some privacy-enhancing features, the robustness of that privacy is a point of contention for academics. For example, if lightning settles in what is termed a ""hub-and-spoke"" structure, there's a risk that nodes with high processing throughput can have an overview of transactions as they run through the network.  While lightning also employs a technique called onion-routing, in which users can route payments through many different channels to hide the contents of a payment, Akinyele warned that the practice might not catch on.  ""They do have some features for encryption, you can route your payment through multiple hops, which is great, but when you talk about bidirectional payments and some of the more basic use-cases that most people will gravitate towards, there is no privacy,"" he explained.  As such, there's a risk users will opt for convenience – such as users linking their transaction histories by using the same bitcoin address repeatedly – rather than the more complex, yet privacy-preserving options.  ""We have seen how this movie plays out in bitcoin,"" Akinyele said.  Learning from leaks  Still, having identified these potential leaks was useful for the development of the BOLT architecture.  Specifically, Akinyele said the design owes a lot to the popularity of the lightning network payment channels being used today, which are beginning to reveal what the network could look like.  ""Having lightning exist and being used has been very helpful in figuring out how to do privacy correctly,"" he told CoinDesk.  ""We're seeing patterns emerge – centralization of some hubs are forming where a lot of people are using the same paths to route payments. All of these patterns are emerging, so it's giving us a real insight into okay, where is the real privacy problem, and what would be the best technique to deal with that,"" Akinyele continued.  And not only that, but going forward, Akinyele feels that BOLT could provide a private link between zcash, bitcoin and litecoin — a layer-two interoperability that he hopes could dismantle some of the tribalism that occurs in cryptocurrency today.  He concluded:  ""It provides an option to figure out how we can get away from 'this currency does this, this currency does that,' and just start thinking more longer term and big picture with how we want to use these currencies in the real world.""

Judge Phyllis Hamilton of the Northern District of California denied Ryan Coffey's motion to remand his suit against Ripple Labs and affiliated entities back to the Superior Court of San Francisco after Ripple escalated the suit to the United States District Court level, court documents published on Friday reveal.  Coffey sued Ripple earlier this year claiming that the XRP cryptocurrency is a security controlled and issued by the firm.  Coffey claimed in his motion to remand that ""'cases arising under' the Securities Act can be brought in state court and are expressly non-removable from state court.""  However, Hamilton noted that the precedents and rules Coffey cited do not necessarily apply, and a federal court can supersede the state court regardless of whether XRP is a security because of the ""nationwide"" nature of the class-action lawsuit.  Ripple is using the same argument in other efforts to move cases to other locations. Legal documents filed last Wednesday show the firm has filed to remove the suit brought by investor Avner Greenwald earlier this month. That suit was filed in the Superior Court of San Mateo, as previously reported, but Ripple wants to try this one with the Northern District of California as well, again citing the ""nationwide"" nature of the class action and the contention that damages could be in excess of $5 million.  It also wants to combine the two cases, filing a ""motion to relate"" the Coffey and Greenwald suits, claiming that if the two cases proceed separately, ""there will be an unduly burdensome duplication of labor and expense or conflicting results if the cases are conducted before different judges.""  Attorney Jake Chervinsky said on coordinate lawsuits brought by Vladi Zakinov and David Oconer, noting that these suits involve the same issues as Greenwald's.  If approved, this would allow the different cases ""to be joined in one court,"" according to the California Courts website.

The company said last week that it would accept bitcoin and ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – as part of its IPO, which seeks to raise as much as $50 million. At the time, according to a press release, CEO Adam Levin said the company was ""taking another step into the future, not only as one of the first cannabis-related brands to go public on the Nasdaq but also as the first to allow bitcoin and ether as part of our public capital raise.""  However, on August 13, it clarified in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that this announcement was a mistake, and the company would not actually be accepting bitcoin.  ""On August 3, 2018, the Company published a press release relating to its Regulation A+ offering stating that it would accept bitcoin as a form of payment for subscription to the Company's shares,"" the filing said, adding:  ""This press release was distributed in error as the Company will not be accepting bitcoin as payment for shares. As provided in the Company's subscription agreement related to the offering, the Company will only be accepting check, credit card, ACH or wire transfer as payment for subscription to shares.""  The filing notably did not mention ether, the other cryptocurrency listed in the press release. High Times did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment about the omission by press time.  The IPO will remain publicly available through a Regulation A+ exemption, allowing retail investors to purchase High Times' common stock. The sale will close either when the company raises the target $50 million or on September 12, the planned end date.

The agency said  that it obtained officer-and-director and penny-stock bars against David Laurance and his company, Tomahawk Exploration LLC. Tomahawk, the SEC alleges, sought to raise funds through a ""Tomahawkcoin"" token sale that utilized misleading marketing materials and false claims about oil drilling licenses.  Further, the Tomahawkcoin is said to have been sold along with the false promise that ""token owners would be able to convert the Tomahawkcoins into equity and potentially profit from the anticipated oil production and secondary trading of the tokens,"" according to the SEC's statement on the matter.  According to the Tuesday announcement, Laurance has neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations but he and the company have agreed to the bars along with a $30,000 penalty.  The officer-and-director bar prevents Laurance from serving in either capacity in a public company, while the penny stock bar prevents him from trading or owning penny stocks. Both prohibitions are permanent, according to the SEC.  ""Investors should be alert to the risk of old-school frauds, like oil and gas schemes, masquerading as innovative blockchain-based ICOs,"" Robert Cohen, who leads the SEC's Cyber Unit, said in a statement.  Notably, the SEC order indicates that the agency is now scrutinizing token distributions for marketing purposes, calling into question whether airdrops (or free dispersals of tokens) constitute securities sales.  As the agency noted:  ""...Tomahawk issued tokens as part of the Bounty Program to generate interest in the ICO, which benefited Tomahawk. Distribution of tokens that are securities in exchange for promotional services to advance the issuer's economic objectives or create a public market for the securities constitute sales for purposes of Section 5 of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.""

42429532,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzQzh,1534258815,Coders Renew Efforts to Fork Mining Giant Bitmain Off Siacoin Blockchain,"New code is set to be released that would make obsolete the mining hardware designed by chip maker Bitmain for the decentralized storage protocol siacoin.  Revealed in an email obtained by CoinDesk, Obelisk, a startup that aims to offer alternative mining equipment for the protocol, has proposed code would give those running the software the option to exclude Bitmain's ASIC miners by changing the rules so the machines are no longer compatible.  ""This will give the sia community the ability to fork and could invalidate all non-Obelisk siacoin ASIC miners on the forked chain,"" the company writes.  The news is notable as it showcases how cryptocurrency communities are responding to the expanding business interests of Bitmain, the China-based mining giant that CoinDesk revealed last week is seeking to raise one of the largest-ever initial public offerings (IPOs).  As detailed in investor documents, part of Bitmain's pitch is the extensibility of its expertise and acumen in designing hardware for bitcoin to other protocols, including siacoin. Founded as a producer of hardware for bitcoin exclusively, Bitmain now supports the alternative cryptocurrencies bitcoin cash, litecoin, dash and ether.  Still, while siacoin, valued at $170 million, is the smallest addition to the company's portfolio, it's also proving one of the most problematic due to the fact that users aren't keen on the idea they would effectively need to purchase Bitmain's products, or similarly powerful equivalents, in order to secure the protocol and compete for its rewards.  Of note also are the credentials of those backing opposition movements that share this sentiment.  Led by siacoin core developer David Vorick, Obelisk is a community-funded ASIC manufacturer that was beaten to market by Bitmain — an event that caused conflict within the siacoin community. Indeed, Obelisk's code was designed with the ability to remove competing ASICs from the network, however, it wasn't activated due to the fear that it could result in a blockchain split.  That said, with the specter of larger corporate interests on the horizon, grassroots sentiment appears to be shifting, at least according to Vorick.  ""As of today, all Nebulous (the company employing sia's core developers) and Obelisk employees are supportive of a fork,"" the email concludes.  The code will be available in ""the coming weeks,"" according to the message. Plus, the mining hardware is also ""almost complete"" and the company ""expect[s] to begin shipping units this week.""  Should siacoin be successful it wouldn't be alone in its efforts to curtail Bitmain's expansion. One of the world's largest cryptocurrencies, the privacy-oriented monero, implemented code to remove Bitmain ASICs earlier this year.  For its part, Obelisk is seeking to position itself as a more developer-friendly alternative to Bitmain, in that it could allow developers to enhance the security of their blockchains without worrying about the motivations of hardware makers.  As detailed by CoinDesk, Obelisk intends to provide ASICs for a wider array of cryptocurrencies – to be built in secret and later released for use by members of those cryptocurrency communities.  Read the full email below:    The Plan      Dear Obelisk Customers,    Production is progressing, firmware is almost complete, and we expect to begin shipping units this week. We now have approval from our team, board, and counsel to share our plan.    First, we will compensate Batch 1 customers with expected mining revenue. Since we missed the estimated shipment date for Batch 1, we will compensate all Batch 1 customers with the mining revenue that you would have received between June 30 and the day your order ships. As of today, this is approximately $90 for each SC1 unit and $250 for each DCR1 unit. If we miss the estimated shipment dates for Batches 2-5, this policy will also apply.    We will begin sending out this compensation to customers sometime after Batch 5 ships. Obelisk will calculate your expected mining revenue based on a hashrate of 800 GH/s for SC1 and 1500 GH/s for DCR1. Compensation will be in USD, and will assume that you exchanged your mined coins for USD on a daily basis and that your electricity cost is $0.    In the coming weeks, we will put together a more complete guide to receiving this compensation and publish our official calculations so that they can be reviewed by the community. Depending on Obelisk's financial position after delivering Batch 5, it may take several months or more to compensate all customers.    Second, we will release the SC1 alternative Blake2b algorithm in the coming weeks. This will give the Sia community the ability to fork and could invalidate all non-Obelisk Siacoin ASIC miners on the forked chain.    The Sia core developers are currently considering community member FaustianAGI's proposal and will soon be issuing an official response. As of today, all Nebulous (the company employing Sia's core developers) and Obelisk employees are supportive of a fork.    There are still many details to solidify, but we pledge to provide additional information in the coming weeks. We are working tirelessly to deliver your orders, and will continue to update you with our progress.

The pre-sale will be followed by 12 ""micro-ICOs"" of $5 million apiece, with each representing a different team and open to the general public through a regulation A+ exemption, meaning it will need to be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Nissanoff expects the public sales to occur somewhere between the end of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019.  The platform itself will launch on a test network around December and is expected to start full operation by next summer.

42429523,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzQnh,1534248046,AirSwap Decentralized Exchange Upgrades for Any-Size Ethereum Trades,"AirSwap is rolling out some pro tools to attract institutional investors to its decentralized exchange (DEX) for ethereum tokens.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the company is this week launching an interface for so-called over-the-counter (OTC) block trading. While to date AirSwap users have been signaling their intent to buy or sell a certain amount of tokens at a certain price on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, the new front end includes a chat feature so traders can negotiate the terms privately. Large, sophisticated investors often prefer trading this way rather than broadcasting a large order that could move the market.  The new interface also includes an identity verification system, with the ID checks performed externally by Wyre, a regulated money services business (MSB). This helps institutional players such as broker-dealers to comply with regulations that require them to know who they are trading with.  Put together, these features should address the worries that have kept DEX-curious institutional investors at bay, bringing a large amount of capital into this market, AirSwap said.  ""It essentially allows your more flexibility on price and the ability to know your counterparty, assess with whom you'd like to do business more directly,"" co-founder Don Mosites told CoinDesk of the new service, adding:  ""With the OTC tools, this unlocks a totally new world of liquidity. This is going to enable trades of any size to happen with the AirSwap network.""  While institutions have been dipping their toes in the crypto markets for some time, it may seem odd that these highly regulated entities would take an interest in decentralized exchanges, given that such platforms were born out of anti-establishment, cypherpunk ideals.  But according to AirSwap, and some of the broker-dealer and hedge fund representatives who attended a demo day at the startup's Brooklyn, N.Y., office last week, DEX appeals to such players for a practical reason.  Unlike the centralized exchanges where most cryptocurrency trades take place, a DEX, by definition, allows investors to control custody of their private keys.  That's not to say all institutions want to handle custody themselves, as hardcore crypto users do. But some would prefer to choose the third-party custodian rather than handing that role to cryptocurrency exchanges, which are notoriously bad at protecting user funds.  In this way, it's telling that BitGo, the multi-signature wallet provider, recently added support for AirSwap's AST tokens (which traders must stake in order to advertise their intent to trade on the DEX's bulletin board). BitGo has been courting high-end custody clients recently, and it said supporting AST was likewise a response to demand from hedge funds and other institutional investors.  Institutional and retail  AirSwap claims its DEX, which fills orders via smart contracts on ethereum, offers a more efficient way to conduct OTC trades, which today are often negotiated over Skype and can take days to settle. But the roadblocks to the institutional use of DEXs are significant.  A lack of accountability is one of the deal-breakers for big-money investors, according to Preston Byrne, an independent blockchain consultant. Most DEXs offer scant options for negotiation or recourse against bad actors.  ""That's one of the reasons you have big counterparties in transactions. It's an insurance policy,"" Byrne said.  Further, in practice decentralized systems are often less efficient than centralized platforms, which Byrne said makes investors wonder:  ""Why are we paying the decentralization penalty if we're not getting all the functionality of an OTC trade, which is individually negotiated and varies somewhat from the current market price?""  The new features AirSwap is adding are designed to address those concerns for institutional investors, whom the company has been courting since its founding last year. But it may also come in handy for projects that are seeking to get their tokens in the hands of everyday consumers.  For example, when the journalism startup Civil launches in October it plans to integrate AirSwap's widget, which facilitates the purchase of tokens from a third party's platform. (More than 16 blockchain projects that use ethereum's ERC-20 standard tokens, from the adult entertainment platform SpankChain to the prediction market Augur, are integrating AirSwap widgets directly into their platforms for this purpose.)  During the first year, the only way to buy Civil tokens will be through a know-your-customer (KYC) process for consumers that proves the buyer is a reader or participating journalist who knows how to store and use cryptocurrency.  Civil CEO Matt Iles told CoinDesk AirSwap's new KYC capabilities, coupled with its atomic swaps and price discovery mechanisms, suited his project's efforts to grow a closed ecosystem without sacrificing liquidity.  Looking to the future, there will be ways for Civil readers to earn tokens for supporting a newsroom, sharing content, or helping to refer new members to a newsroom. As such, the OTC block trading functions could apply down the line to experts looking to convert those rewards into a more diversified portfolio.  ""We're both trying to pioneer what this consumer token world could look like,"" Iles said. ""AirSwap is interested in exploring this consumer space with us as something that is going to grow and become a larger part of their offering.""

42429535,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzR9h,1534244407,"Under Pressure: Bitcoin Price Could Defend $5.6K, Charts Say","Down two-thirds from its December all-time high of $20,000, bitcoin (BTC) now risks printing fresh 2018 lows below $5,755.  The corrective rally seen over the weekend failed to penetrate the key rising trendline hurdle of $6,480 on Monday, allowing the bears to make a strong comeback.  As a result, the leading cryptocurrency fell below $6,000 (February low) and extended the slide to $5,859 earlier today – the lowest level since June 29 – according to Bitfinex data.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,032 – down 6 percent in the last 24 hours. Despite sharp losses, bitcoin is the fourth best-performing cryptocurrency among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.  Other cryptocurrencies are reporting bigger losses. For instance, 92 out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have suffered double-digit losses on a 24-hour basis.  Further, the bitcoin dominance rate, a measure of BTC's market share, jumped to an eight-month high of 53.7 percent today.  Hence, it seems safe to say that the cryptocurrency markets have turned risk-averse, that is, investors are venturing out of the high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into well-established cryptocurrencies like BTC, and then possibly on to fiat currency.  Looking ahead, the downtrend in bitcoin prices could continue as the technical chart analysis is calling a deeper sell-off – although support at $5,650 could hold for now.  4-hour chart  The bears are likely to be feeling emboldened following the bull failure at the descending trendline hurdle despite the bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) seen in the chart above.  More importantly, the bullish RSI divergence has been invalidated (prices dropped below $6,000) within three days of confirmation, which indicates the bearish sentiment is quite strong.  What's more, the major moving averages (50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle) continue to trend south in favor of the bears.  Thus, BTC could hit fresh yearly lows below $5,755 (June low) this week.  Weekly chart  As the above chart shows, BTC could encounter support around $5,650 (trendline drawn from the February low of $6,000 and the June low of $5,755).  BTC may, however, defend support at $5,650 in the short-term, as the cryptocurrency is looking oversold, having dropped more than 40 percent over the last three weeks.  If the support at $5,650 is breached, though, then the lower end of the falling channel, currently located at $5,340, could come into play.  View  BTC could drop below the June low of $5,755 this week, however, support at $5,650 (as per the weekly chart) could hold ground in the short-term, courtesy of the oversold conditions.  A high volume break above the falling trendline seen in the 4-hour chart would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and would allow a rally to $6,850–$7,000.  The outlook as per the weekly chart would turn bullish if prices break above the July high of $8,507.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42429524,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzQph,1534244371,Jamaica Stock Exchange to Trade Crypto Assets in 2018,"The Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) will soon be offering cryptocurrencies as tradeable assets for clients.  The company said Tuesday that it had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with blockchain startup Blockstation for the creation of a new digital assets trading platform. While it is not clear which tokens will be initially listed, the platform is set to go live by the end of the year.  In interview, JSE managing director Marlene Street Forrest said that offering cryptocurrencies as investment products fits in with the equities, bonds and other investment products that the exchange already offers.  Forrest told CoinDesk:  ""The end game at the end of the day is to trade tokens, the end game is smart contracts, the end game is to provide that area of the market that would like this product, to start to do so in a secure manner.""  Blockstation is providing the technology, she explained, while the JSE's infrastructure will be networked to the new platform, allowing qualified investors to conduct purchases or trades.  Aside from listing cryptocurrencies for trade, Street Forrest said the stock exchange will continue to look at how blockchain technology can benefit the platform and its clients, going so far as to indicate that JSE's plans may include issuing its own cryptocurrency at some time in the future.  ""The environment changes, the entire ecosystem changes, so at that point in time that might be the case, [although] at this point in time that is not a discussion,"" she said.  Blockstation co-founder and chief enterprise architect Jai Waterman told CoinDesk that the startup has been working with the JSE for roughly six months in order to develop a custom version of its platform for the exchange. Specific requests from the JSE have included tools to track market manipulation and other regulatory needs, he noted.  ""Our mission is to provide … a secure method of trading cryptocurrencies with broker-dealers and stock exchanges,"" he said. ""We're providing the stock exchange the technology for a broker-dealer network and depository, so that from end-to-end, their life cycle of trading – just like with securities – they can do the exact same thing with blockchain and cryptocurrencies.""  The JSE is in no rush, however, and is taking its time to ensure that the launch is safe for investors, Street Forrest said.  ""We have a steering committee that was designed and formulated to look at the Blockstation product, to look at the blockchain technology in general and to go through the phases to ensure that we understand what we are getting involved with and are also trained in what this entire trading of cryptocurrency involves,"" she explained.

42429536,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzRBh,1534233601,A New Way to Compare Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin,"Peter Ryan is a research analyst at CoinDesk.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      In Robert Heinlein's novel ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" the character Jubal Harshaw asks one of his secretaries to identify the color of a house in the distance. She replies, ""it's white on this side.""  In other words, if you see something only from a certain angle, you can't be confident you have the full picture. This goes for cryptocurrencies as well as for physical objects.  While it would be disingenuous to claim the price of a coin doesn't matter, it's only one of several ways to measure the success of a blockchain network. Looking at these in aggregate offers a more useful perspective than obsessively checking U.S. dollar exchange rates on your phone every hour. (Or every minute, for some. Stop that, it's not healthy.)  To that end, CoinDesk Research's crypto-economic compass shows more activity going on than just price movements. It compiles a variety of different sub-factors to make up four other composite measures: developer, network, social, and exchange.  Using this multi-dimensional analytical tool, let's take a look at bitcoin cash (BCH), the splinter currency that recently celebrated its first birthday. We'll compare it to the network it seceded from, the original bitcoin (BTC), which is viewed as the gold standard for cryptocurrencies, along these five axes.  The most observed metric, price, saw very little deviation during BCH's first year of existence. For most of that period, it remained around 12 percent to that of BTC. The price saw all-time-highs of around 20 percent of BTC in the fall 2017 rally but slowly diminished back down to normalcy.  The network category refers to activity concerning the on-chain network. Transaction volume occurring on the BCH blockchain remained on average under ten percent of BTC's on-chain volume throughout the year.  However, this last month saw the number of transactions consistently increasing to about 30 to 50 percent of BTC's. This could signal increased microtransactions due to new app development or stress testing by large entities.  One such app is CoinText which allows users to send and receive BCH through text messages.  Its CTO, Vin Armani, said:  ""When high fees and slow confirmation times began plaguing BTC, I shelved bitcoin projects that I had been working on steadily for years...I know I wasn't alone in walking through 2017 feeling discouraged...In this past year, Bitcoin Cash has brought hope and creative exploration back to bitcoin.""  Exchanges and developers  Exchange activity was a bit more varied over the year.  BCH volume transacted on exchanges reached all-time-highs in 2017, even briefly exceeding BTC's exchange volume on August 19 and November 11. Over 100 exchanges currently list BCH, many of which added the support in Q3 of 2017.  But when the general crypto rally of fall 2017 dissipated, exchange activity withered away to 8 percent of BTC's volume in Q1 and 12 percent in Q2.  Developer activity on the protocol level has been relatively low for BCH. While it benefits from the legacy code from before the fork, since then the breakaway network has not maintained the same level of developer interest as BTC.  Social signals  Meanwhile, the most unique observation concerns bitcoin cash's high levels of social activity, reaching about 57 percent of BTC's.  The sub-factor driving much of this phenomenon is the posting on the BCH-oriented r/btc subreddit. Another key social media advantage has been the commandeering of the @bitcoin twitter handle with its 800,000+ followers.  It appears that these highly engaged online communities have grown offline. Event meetup groups have maintained steady growth. According to the BCH Fund, there are 101 meetups in 40 different countries with about 12,000 total members.  In this way, crypto-economics sheds light on all sides of the house, as it were, and reveals a more holistic understanding of a cryptocurrency's state of affairs.  BCH on-chain and developer activity remained low relative to BTC, but exchange activity drastically fluctuates with speculation. Bitcoin cash's price has been able to stay afloat this past year, thanks in no small part to the small but strong group of social communities invigorating this coin.

As reported by Korean news outlet JoongAng Daily on Monday, the governor of Jeju province proposed the idea at a meeting last week with central government officials and lawmakers, including Korea's finance minister.  Governor Won Hee-ryong indicted that, through the proposal, he intends to make Jeju island a blockchain hub in which projects that focus on innovation will be free to host ICOs as a way to finance their companies and services.  The aim, according to Won, is ""for Korea to become a leader rather than a consumer of this new global industry.""  In addition, Won is also seeking to form a task force with officials from both Jeju province, the central government and industry experts in a bid to advance his government's support for blockchain development.  Designated as a self-governing province in the early 2000s, Jeju island has enjoyed a high level of administrative autonomy as part of South Korea's effort to boost economic and tourism development in the area.  The proposal comes at a time when Korea's central government has followed China's lead in announcing that unauthorized ICOs are deemed as illegal fundraising activities.  However, lawmakers in the country have already been discussing lifting the country's ICO ban, as previously reported by CoinDesk.

42429529,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzQxh,1534219204,You Can Now Get Paid (a Little) for Using Bitcoin's Lightning Network,"Those running lightning nodes are earning a little extra bitcoin.  Trumpeted as a way to scale bitcoin to handle mainstream adoption, there's a lesser-known perk to spinning up a lightning node to allow users to send cheap, instant payments – you can make money.  To be clear, we're not talking very much.  Today's average fee on the lightning network clocks in at about one satoshi, worth a fraction of a cent, per hop (so every time a node routes the transaction to another node). As such, one of lightning's prominent application developers, Alex Bosworth, reported a monthly income of roughly $2.  Though the profits are pretty meager now, they could be a sign of how the network will develop over time.  The lightning network is what the name implies: a network. In order to send a payment to someone, the payment will typically bounce across several different nodes before it reaches the recipient – similar to the old-style mail carriers passing letters or packages from person to person to get it to its destination.  On the network, each node operator has the option of charging a small fee for carrying the payment a part of the way.  Because this fee market is already emerging, it displays that crypto enthusiasts are more than willing to take some risks (people using the nascent lightning network right now have actually been labeled ""reckless"" by the protocol's developers).  Speaking to this, Bosworth recently tweeted:  ""I think for many people, even OG HODLers, the satoshis earned for providing routing will be among the first bitcoin they ever earn outside of coin trading.""  Tweaking the fee  Still, there are some hurdles to earning satoshis with lightning.  For now, participating in the lightning network takes some technical know-how and quite a bit of digital storage capacity. Anyone who wants to route a lightning payment needs to download bitcoin's entire transaction history, nearly 200 GB of data, and then download the lightning software on top of that.  Currently, there are at least 3,000 nodes on the network.  After becoming a node, the user needs to update the default fee feature, which is set at zero. For the LND implementation of lightning, one of the most popular, this ability to change the fee and monitor how much you're earning from the fee is relatively new.  ""In LND, it used to be that you couldn't see what kind of fees you were earning, but that feature was added in and that spurred more fee activity,"" Bosworth told CoinDesk.  Yet, another thing to keep in mind is that users are competing with each other here.  In order to get more people to use their node as a hop in their route, nodes can't charge too much (that's why Bosworth's fees are so low).  But even the lowest of fees are sometimes passed over. For whatever reason, right now, many lightning nodes aren't charging any fees; it's possible many of the nodes are just lightning enthusiasts that aren't worried about making money from their interest.  As such, Bosworth believes some users are probably avoiding his node.  And the users that do route payments through his node, Bosworth guesses, those are probably just users that don't have any other route options for getting their payment where it needs to go.  Reasons for fees  While it's impossible to know how the market will evolve at this point, developers believe there are beneficial reasons for allowing fees.  ""You want the system to work not just because people have kind hearts,"" Ben Woosley, a developer of the lightning wallet app Zap, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""As the network grows and a smaller portion are using it for ideological reasons, fees will move toward a more economic outcome.""  Even if fees remain tiny, Woosley continued, they can be useful for a number of reasons.  For one, the network needs liquidity. Each lightning node has a certain amount of ""liquidity,"" or how much money can be routed through it based on how much money the operator has locked up in the channel. Channels with more money will be able to support bigger payments or many more payments, and because of that service might be able to charge for those hops, Woosley argued.  Plus, fees also ""provide a way for nodes to encourage or discourage people to join their channels,"" Woosley added.  In this way, lightning developers have even instituted a negative fee for the case where a node actually wants to pay users for routing money through them. This might happen if, for example, a channel runs out of money in one direction and needs to be ""rebalanced"" with more funds.  And, Bosworth notes, specialized lightning payments, such as those trading one cryptocurrency for another, will be more complex and as such, could be spendier.  Predicting fees?  Yet, according to Bosworth, ""This is a market, so predicting [costs] will be super tough.""  That said, many developers believe fees will remain quite low in the future as well.  For one thing, the costs of spinning up a node and routing payments via the lightning network are not that high. Sure, it takes time – more time than downloading a traditional mobile payment app. But it doesn't have a lot of financial costs.  For that reason, lightning network co-authors Tadge Dryja and Joseph Poon predicted back in 2016 that fees would be ""effectively zero."" And, so far, their prediction is holding up.  ""I think the payment routing system will eventually settle to what is basically just a 'I scratch your back, you scratch mine' level,"" pseudonymous lightning developer ZmnSCPxj said.  In other words, the developer guesses that routing people's payments for a minuscule fee will be done so that others will route their lightning payments for cheap as well.  And with that, many believe that lightning payments will be far cheaper than current online payment systems – a scenario that will excite long-time bitcoin enthusiasts that were passionate about the technology because of its ability to upend the legacy systems.  ""Credit cards charge around 3 percent, so lightning will probably be orders of magnitude cheaper than credit cards,"" Woosley said, concluding:  ""My expectation is [lightning fees] will be negligible, like less than a cent, forever.""
