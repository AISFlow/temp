42399270,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijRx,1471374093,California Delays Efforts to Regulate Bitcoin Businesses,"California's legislature has once again shelved a plan to regulate businesses in the digital currency industry.  Reintroduced after nearly a year of dormancy earlier this month, Assembly Bill 1326 has now been referred back to the state's Rules Committee and Banking and Finance Committee – effectively freezing its progress.  Word first emerged on Friday that the measure would be delayed, and a representative for the Banking and Finance Committee has since confirmed to CoinDesk it will not be heard in the legislature again this year.  She said:  ""It's being delayed for this year.""  The move will prolong the already long road for the bill, which was first introduced in 2015 and saw months of back-and-forth debate take place between industry representatives, state lawmakers and technology advocacy groups.  However, statements from representatives of the legislature suggest that the bill, at least in some form, will return during the legislative session next year.  Banking and Finance Committee spokesperson Mark Farouk told American Banker that the bill ""is dead for this year"", suggesting that significant change was in the works. Farouk reportedly indicated that work by the Uniform Law Commission on a template for digital currency regulation could also play a role.  ""I think there's going to be a lot of things that are going to be modified,"" he told the publication.  The Banking and Finance Committee did not offer comment on whether the law would be revisited in 2017.

42399272,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijUu,1471372528,UK Fraud Office Comments on 'Increasing' Bitcoin Use By Criminals,"A criminal investigatory unit in the UK is reporting that it has seen an increase in the use of bitcoin by criminals.  The UK Serious Fraud Office, an independent agency within the UK government, disclosed the stance in new comments addressing whether it believes bitcoin is ""being used"" in criminal activity. The remarks, published yesterday, represent what appear to be the SFO’s first public statements on bitcoin.  While the agency denied that it had undertaken any specific studies on the technology, the SFO said that it would consider such investigations given its mandate to look into new forms of fraud.  The SFO said in its response:  ""We would therefore consider specific allegations of bitcoin being used to perpetrate serious or complex fraud. Such a case might, for instance, represent a new or emerging type of fraud. The SFO is aware of increasing use of bitcoin by criminals but has not conducted any specific studies into the impact of this type of crime.""  While the SFO indicated that it hasn't pursued or released any research of its own, other elements of the UK government have done so in the past.  Last November, HM Treasury released a report detailing how digital currencies pose the lowest money laundering risk among other means, including banks and cash.

42399267,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijP0,1471366540,Plane Maker Airbus Joins Hyperledger Blockchain Project,"French airplane manufacturer Airbus has officially joined the Hyperledger Project, the Linux Foundation-led blockchain initiative.  The Toulouse-based manufacturer, which last year beat Boeing to sell more than 1,000 aircraft, is expected to “actively contribute” to the initiative, which also counts companies such as IBM, Intel and JPMorgan among its membership.  Airbus, founded in 1970, manufactures and sells the world's largest passenger plane, the A380.  Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf said the inclusion of Airbus shows that the technology has applications beyond finance and healthcare, going on to remark:  ""A key factor to the project’s success will be member expertise and guidance, and as such, I look forward to collaborating with the bright team at Airbus to drive this technology forward.""  According to the project's GitHub page, two Airbus employees currently work on one of its subcommittees. Correspondence on the Hyperledger mailing list suggests that the company has an internal Emerging Technologies and Concepts working group that is exploring the technology.  Airbus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The announcement reflects what appears to be the airline industry’s increasing interest in blockchain technology. In May, blockchain startup ShoCard partnered with airline IT firm SITA to develop applications around identity management.  Launched last year, the Hyperledger Project counts roughly 80 members among its community of established businesses and startups, not all of which have been publicly announced, managed by the Linux Foundation.

42399264,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijM3,1471361909,Blockchain World Expo Postponed Until 2017,"A scheduling conflict has resulted in the postponement of the Blockchain World Expo, a three-day industry conference originally set to be held this September in Canada.  Scheduled to run from 19th to 21st September, the inaugural event was notable give its sponsorship by TMX Group, the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange. Organizers included blockchain development firm Decentral, Ethereum Canada and Accelerate Finance.  Organizers said the event was ultimately moved due to the scheduling of a Canada FinTech Forum event to take place 20th and 21st September.  Anthony Di Iorio, chief digital officer at the Toronto Stock Exchange and CEO of Decentral, said additional considerations were involved, but that the competing event was the deciding factor. An update posted to the event’s official website indicated the formal request was made by event sponsors.  Di Iorio said plans are in place to potentially reschedule the event, billed as the largest of its kind in press materials.  “We're targeting spring next year,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/08/16/blockchain-world-expo-postponed-until-2017,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42399282,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijbn,1471349264,Hyperledger Tests Open Strategy With First Blockchain Explorer,"Business blockchain consortium Hyperledger is now building an open-source tool that will let anyone explore the distributed ledger projects being created by its members.  Originally conceived by an intern at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the proposal to create a blockchain explorer gained steam last month when it was informally proposed to members. It was then that other prominent contributors to the Linux-led group discovered they all had similar efforts underway.  But instead of launching competing open-source services, an effort began to merge the blockchain explorers being developed by DTCC, IBM and Intel. The joint project has been dubbed the ""Hyperledger Explorer"".  Similar to block explorers already being offered for other public blockchains, the tool would make it easier to learn about Hyperledger from the inside, while still protecting the privacy valued by many of the non-profit organization's members.  Hyperledger's newly appointed executive director Brian Behlendorf told CoinDesk:  ""Rather than have three different projects that all do the same thing and compete essentially as three different code bases, [we thought] why not work together on one common codebase and cherrypick the best parts and use this as an opportunity to talk about standards for talking to different systems?""  When completed, the explorer is expected to give Hyperledger developers and non-technical users access to block information, transaction data, network information (such as a list of nodes) and chain codes or transaction families.  Since it was founded in late 2014, Hyperledger has grown to include major enterprises (CME Group, Hitachi and JP Morgan) and blockchain startups (Blockstream, Bloq, itBit).  Standard connections  According to some of the members involved, the project could end up being the first real test of the open-source collaboration.  The day after DTCC intern Konrad Pabjan submitted the code, Behlendorf responded with his support for the proposal. At the time, he noted that IBM was working on a similar offering that would detach its existing explorer from its Bluemix app development platform.  Intel's head of technology for blockchain and distributed ledgers, Dan Middleton, noted that his firm was working on a similar effort and instead of overlapping efforts, he proposed a ""unified Hyperledger explorer"".  Middleton wrote in the original email chain:  ""This could be an interesting first case for showing ledger interaction among the Hyperledger family of blockchains.""  By the end of the day, IBM's CTO in charge of open technology, Chris Ferris, had dubbed the project the ""Hyperledger Blockchain Explorer"", which has since been shortened to just the Hyperledger Explorer.  The code is currently being developed under the Apache software license created by the non-profit, open-source software company founded by Behlendorf, the Apache Foundation. Under terms of the license, anyone will be able use the browser, even non-members.  By building one single blockchain explorer through which anyone can explore projects, the participants will continue the process of standardization that the ISITC last month told CoinDesk could lead to unexpected network effects.  Deepening the bonds  But as more companies like Bank of America and HSBC begin to unveil proofs-of-concept using the Hyperledger protocol, a standardized way to search its data is just part of what it will take to scale, according to Behlendorf.  When Behlendorf was first hired in May, one of his goals was to make it easier for new members to join and for anyone – including non-members – to use the open-source software.  By moving the group's communication from predominantly conference calls to Slack, and beginning the process of switching its development tools from Github to Gerrick, he said they've take the first steps towards accomplishing that goal.  Since his appointment the consortium has more than doubled in size from less than 40 members to 80 members today, not all of which have been announced.  In total, there are now 160 code contributors, including individuals that may not be working on behalf of any company.  Protecting the future  This approach has led to other considerations, such as how to handle the question of ownership in a collaborative setting.  To help ensure that companies building on the code don’t accidentally find themselves in violation of intellectual copyright law, Behlendorf said contributors each sign an Apache license certifying that they have the legal rights to contributed the code.  The collected copyright of Hyperledger is owned by the Linux Foundation.  In an effort to further formalize the increasingly intertwined relationships, Hyperledger will host an election beginning Thursday to appoint 11 new members to its technical steering committee.  Behlendorf said the new explorer is part of that effort to further create the bonds that he believes form a successful open-source community.  Behlendorf concluded:  ""We are turning towards this idea that Hyperledger can be a home for a number of different projects with different focuses, with different priorities, with different agendas, all collectively connected by this concept of blockchains, distributed ledgers [and] smart contracts.""
