""The flood of demand has to be satisfied so it's going to have to get well over a trillion dollars – $2 trillion, I think, before the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] will feel comfortable about"" a bitcoin ETF, Wood said at Tuesday's ETF Trends Big Ideas event.      Bitcoin's market capitalization hovered a tick under $600 billion at press time Tuesday.      Wood was bullish on bitcoin's prospects under Gary Gensler, the former Commodity Futures Trading Commission head and MIT digital currency professor who has been nominated to lead the SEC by President Joe Biden. Wood called Gensler ""very pro bitcoin"" and praised the SEC's crypto savvy leadership.      Gensler, who would undoubtedly become the most crypto knowledgeable SEC chair if confirmed, has nonetheless described himself as ""a little bit center minimalist on bitcoin."" He is more of a ""center maximalist"" about blockchain technologies and smart contracts, however.

42385775,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOFSf,1611698622,How Bitcoiners Should Watch the US Federal Reserve Meeting on Wednesday,"It’s the debate the Federal Reserve isn’t ready to have yet: how to keep inflation from spiraling out of control once the economy opens back up.      Considering the devastating toll from the coronavirus and the trillions of dollars of stimulus pumped into the financial system over the past year, top economists say the looming transition could present one of the more challenging episodes in the U.S. central bank’s 108-year history – while providing a crucial test of bitcoin’s use as a possible inflation hedge.      Economists are watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks on Wednesday when he’ll sum up the January meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Powell’s comments will primarily address the short-term economic outlook but may contain hints for how the central bank plans to approach the medium to long term.    The short term    In recent weeks regional Fed presidents have raised the question of whether the Fed will dial back or continue with a quantitative easing program of purchasing $80 billion per month of Treasurys and $40 billion per month of mortgage-backed securities. This program will likely remain unchanged until consumers start spending again in a COVID-free world, economists say.      “If you look at breakevens or any kind of market indicator or even consensus forecasts from economists, none of them show above 2% inflation during the next five years,” said David Beckworth, a former international economist at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. “As the vaccine rolls out, all of this pent-up money savings is going to be spent. It’s going to be a roaring-hot economy. Will the Fed nip it in the bud?”      No one expects the Federal Reserve to act in terms of rates or asset purchases this week, said former Federal Reserve economist Claudia Sahm, but investors will be looking for an updated message from Powell.      Sahm expects Powell to reiterate what Vice Chair Richard Clarida said earlier in January about the Fed likely not raising rates until it sees 2% inflation for a year.      “The Fed has never held back on interest rates with inflation running at 2% for a year,” Sahm said. “We haven’t seen 2% inflation on any kind of a sustained basis since before 2008, but it’s important for them to say this because we’re going to see inflation that is higher than it is right now.”      Beckworth said he is hoping to see similar guidance around asset purchases.      Powell will likely offer a “steady as she goes” view of the Fed’s operations, said Harvard economist Ken Rogoff. He wants to not “draw attention” to the Fed, Rogoff added.      More tempered inflation estimates are likely to deflate enthusiasm among bitcoin backers, but crypto investors may see the Fed change its mind later this year.    Maintaining course    Currently, the FOMC projects steady monetary policy but steady expectations have changed in the past, said Lawrence White, an economics professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.      “People are sitting on huge piles of money relative to their income, much higher than they usually hold,” White said. “We could see something above 2% until the Fed changes monetary policy … if [Powell] begins to see signs of inflation he may feel more justified in tightening monetary policy.”      Just because inflation is low in the U.S., however, doesn’t mean that bitcoin doesn’t have an opportunity to prove itself as a hedge against inflation, White said.      “It’s not just U.S. inflation that people move into bitcoin to avoid,” White said. “There are bullish markets for bitcoin in Venezuela and Lebanon and Argentina – places with really high inflation. … I don’t think the market for bitcoin shows any close relationship to month-to-month U.S. inflation figures. So people who are holding it as an inflation hedge are thinking longer term than that.”      Other narratives that drive the value of bitcoin include dissidents looking for payments that are difficult to censor, White said. Most recently, bitcoin donations to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s main opponent, Alexey Nalvany, increased by 3.7 BTC.      “That’s helped me understand why there’s a niche demand for bitcoin as a medium of exchange,” White said. “It’s not just buying it in hopes of some bigger fool in the future buying it from me.”    Positive outlook    Barring any large contractions in the economy, the Fed has already signaled it doesn’t plan to increase asset purchases in the future.      That’s why the FOMC will also be focused on the effectiveness of the vaccine rollout versus the spread of new COVID-19 variants, Sahm said, and watching to see that an uncontrolled outbreak doesn’t create fear for spenders. Mass layoffs and declines in spending in March 2020 occurred in places with and without strict lockdowns – largely because Americans were generally scared of going out in public, Sahm said.      “We could have a positive spiral take hold this spring and this summer but it’s not guaranteed,” Sahm said. “The expectations of people, consumers build on the small business side. Those are really important for behavior, and they’re not always driven by clear-cut economic events. … There are virus fears that differ across the country and differ by political affiliation.”      The central bank will be trying to watch for when spending will come back in full force, and how quickly the economy may return to full employment.      “The Fed has been expanding the monetary base at a rapid rate for a year now,” White said. “M1 [money supply] has grown 72% over the last 12 months and M2 has grown 27% and we haven’t seen the kind of inflation you would normally get from that.” (M1 includes very liquid monies such as cash, demand deposits, and traveler's checks; M2 includes less-liquid funds such as savings, certificates of deposit and money-market funds.)      All else being equal, an increase in M1 would produce inflation of 72%, White added, but this number means little on its own. Because the world is not spending more during the pandemic-induced recession, it’s doubtful the economy will see an outbreak of double-digit inflation.      When people begin to travel and eat in restaurants regularly again, the Fed may “have to dial back on the money supply” to avoid inflation well above 2%, White said.    Letting it boil    As the Fed props up financial markets while 10 million Americans are out of work, inequality will increase. Running the economy hot may be Powell’s best solution for trying to help the U.S. recover, Beckworth said.      Meanwhile, low interest rates have investors searching for yield and running to every asset that has high returns.      “It drives up art, it drives up cryptocurrencies, it drives up gold, it drives up everything,” Rogoff said. “Whether or not you think it’s a bubble goes around how likely you think real interest rates will go up.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/26/how-bitcoiners-should-watch-the-us-federal-reserve-meeting-on-wednesday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc483d6485b1b81868bedcd706d4b59004e3de2e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $32,003 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $30,875- $32,967 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour but below the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price fell Tuesday, going as low as $30,875 around 15:00 UTC (10 a.m. ET) before coming back up, changing hands around $32,003.      The drop occurred after the world’s oldest cryptocurrency reached nearly $35,000 on Monday, noted Constantine Kogan, partner at investment firm Wave Financial, who is also bearish on current market conditions. “I expect a decline to $29,000,” he told CoinDesk. “Apparently some of the holders and whales sold off their positions.”      Kogan noted some positive news this week that didn’t move the bitcoin market much. “Marathon has invested $150 million in bitcoin and intends to become the largest miner in the world,” he said. “Crypto funds are raising records, but there was no growth at the same time.”      Read More: Crypto Miner Marathon Patent Group Buys $150M in Bitcoin      The last time bitcoin was over $35,000 was almost a week ago on Jan. 20, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      “Many crypto natives and macro traders were anticipating a ~30% pullback off the all-time high from two weeks ago,” noted Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer for investment firm Ether Capital. “Now that it seems to have stabilized in the low $30,000s, traders are treating this as an opportunity to lever up and go long ahead of the next leg up.”      Tuesday looked like a fairly priced day for long bitcoin leverage, as funding rates dipped a bit from Monday. That was a change from the excitement over the past 90 days, when margin rates could go as over 0.2% on some venues during the crazy price run-up to Jan. 10’s all-time high of $40,986.      Some are using bitcoin’s valuation relative to other cryptocurrencies as a signal for what’s ahead in the market.      “I have a strong sentiment towards ether as a leading indicator for an upcoming alt season,” Global Digital Asset Chief Operating Officer Zachary Friedman told CoinDesk, referring to market conditions that favor “alts” or alternative cryptocurrencies.      Friedman pointed out that bitcoin’s dominance, its share as a percentage of the total crypto market cap, is falling. Indeed, since the start of 2021, bitcoin dominance has fallen more than 10%.      “BTC dominance is dropping as profits are redistributed and ETH sitting just near its all-time high presents an immediate opportunity for new market entrants to diversify their holdings and seek additional yields,” Friedman added.    Bitcoin flows back into decentralized finance    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Tuesday trading around $1,340 and slipping 2.2% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Big Guns Back $10M Investment in DeFi’s dYdX      On Monday the amount of bitcoin held in decentralized finance, or DeFi, crossed back over 40,000 BTC for the first time since mid-December. As of press time, 42,604 BTC were “locked” in DeFi, which investors do to obtain a “yield” in exchange for providing liquidity.      Ether Capital’s Mosoff says the rotation back into DeFi is simply investors chasing juicier opportunities as the market for bitcoin seems to be in a lull.      “Holders are anticipating ‘alt season’, and want to use their bitcoin to leverage additional exposure to other opportunities within the crypto space, whether it be DeFi tokens or other layer 1s such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, NEAR, etc.,” Mosoff said. “Many of these projects have a lot of momentum at the moment and are well positioned for investor participation.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly red Tuesday.

42405778,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoXK8,1611695209,Bubbles Are Good for Bitcoin,"Over the last few weeks, the price of bitcoin has hit a record high of more than $41,000, blowing past the 2017 bubble high point of $19,783. The price has since declined relatively rapidly, and questions have arisen about what’s next for this latest bubble. This presents an opportune moment to analyze why these bubbles form and what they mean for the future of bitcoin.      Price volatility causes market uncertainty and is often viewed as detrimental. However, for bitcoin, the price volatility – such as this recent bubble and past ones of varying sizes in 2017 and 2019 – can be ultimately beneficial for the future of cryptocurrencies, because it promotes wider adoption of this up and coming technology.    Yanhao ""Max"" Wei is an assistant professor of marketing at USC Marshall School of Business.    In some sense, bubbles, which we are defining as a price surge that experiences a decline afterward and then stabilizes at a lower level, essentially becomes free advertising for bitcoin.

Soon, people start wondering about bitcoin and whether they should get in on the action.      This phenomenon was borne out in research I conducted with my USC Marshall colleague Anthony Dukes, blending standard models of product diffusion with macro-financial economics to identify a new view of currency speculation.      The models showed us that price bubbles and user adoption can reinforce each other in a cryptocurrency market. In fact, Google searches for bitcoin peaked at the same time that bubbles were peaking in November 2013 and December 2017. The largest jump happened in 2017, around the time of the largest price bubble in bitcoin history prior to this most recent one. During this current bubble, we’re already seeing the start of a surge in Google trends for searches of the terms “bitcoin” and “blockchain.”      People’s interest – reflected in the volume of the Google search – surged as the bitcoin price surged. Our research notes that these surges in attention are connected to events that alter people’s ability to use bitcoin, such as the introduction of the Shared Coin service in November of 2013, which offered anonymity in transactions.      Further, if we look at the historical number of bitcoin wallet accounts, we see there was much steeper growth in the number of accounts around December 2017, which matches the peak in the Google trend. This peak in attention corresponds in time with decisions by Japan, Russia and Norway to recognize bitcoin as a legitimate currency.      This accelerated interest and adoption has a big impact on the price of bitcoin. To more users, bitcoin better serves as a medium of exchange, which in turn attracts even more people to use bitcoin. The expectation of growth attracts investors to bitcoin and drives up its price.      It becomes a reinforcing loop where price bubbles accelerate the growth of the bitcoin user base, the expectation of which then fuels the price bubble. The question of why bitcoin price has been so volatile should be answered with this reinforcement in mind.      Essentially, the spotlight on bitcoin bubbles is beneficial because the influx of investors helps make the currency more liquid – more widely accepted as payment and easier to be quickly exchanged. The lack of liquidity is one of the biggest obstacles for a new currency to be adopted.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: No, Bitcoin Is Not in a Bubble      The novelty of a price surge is likely important. As the price newly started to rise, more people heard about bitcoin and were interested enough to create a wallet account. If the price increase wasn’t a novelty, it wouldn’t have attracted the same level of excitement and attention. Compare this to when a brand introduces limited edition shoes, and the hype surrounding the “drop” gets attention in and of itself.      Aside from bitcoin itself, the attention on the big price bubbles very likely has sped up the diffusion of the promising technology that powers bitcoin, namely the blockchain, which holds promise for many applications beyond cryptocurrencies. Essentially a technology to secure any type of data or records, blockchain is being applied in supply chain, real estate, health care and many more sectors.      Scholars have tended to look at the price bubbles and the user adoption as two separate issues – as either a finance or a marketing issue. Our research raises the importance of the two interacting with each other. The infamous price volatility and bubbles may very well be embraced by bitcoin advocates, as these help expand the universe of bitcoin users and where the currency can be used.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING | RESEARCH,Yanhao Max Wei,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/26/bubbles-are-good-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/445cd7b286a089a1015aadab581b50f4c057efd1-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405779,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoXL7,1611692711,"Bitcoin Falls as Miners Sell, Institutions Watch Yellen","Bitcoin’s price dropped as much as 10% during early trading hours on Tuesday as bitcoin miners started selling a large amount of the cryptocurrency for the first time since October. There is not enough demand to absorb the additional coins on the market because institutions want an idea of how the new Biden Administration will view bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.      At the press time, bitcoin was trading at $32,254.59, down 3.04% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s BPI. The price went as low as nearly $30,000 after markets opened in the U.S. on Tuesday.    Miners selling    Bitcoin miners’ position index, a ratio of the number of bitcoin leaving all miners’ wallets to that number’s one-year moving average, reached an eight-year high last week and is still above 2.0, according to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant. Any value above 2.0 indicates that most miners are selling.      Miners appear to have been selling in order to meet some of their operational costs.      “For the first time in a while, it appears miners sold some fairly substantial holdings to raise cash as we expected on a rally after October,” Neil Van Huis, director of sales and institutional trading at Blockfills, told CoinDesk. “With a need to allocate capital to more (and newer) mining rigs, taking bitcoin off of their balance sheet for cash at three or four times higher prices 30-60 days after the wet season ended in China was about the best scenario [miners] could’ve asked for.”    Not enough buyers    While miners continue selling bitcoin, it seems there aren’t enough buyers, especially from the institutional investors, to meet the sell side.      The “Coinbase premium,” the gap between Coinbase’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair involving the tether stablecoin, has not shown strong or consistent numbers above $50 after it went negative last week, according to data from CryptoQuant.      When this metric goes above $50, it usually indicates stronger spot buying pressure from Coinbase, CryptoQuant Chief Executive Ki Young Ju told CoinDesk. And when there are no USD spot inflows, the premium goes down.      Read More: Bitcoin Slumps to $31K on Sell-Off in US and Europe      Meanwhile, all stablecoins reserved on all exchanges hit a new all-time high on CryptoQuant’ tracker. This, coupled with no U.S. dollar spot inflows, means the current market is predominantly driven by crypto natives such as crypto hedge funds and market makers. Such market participants are more comfortable with buying and selling bitcoin with stablecoins, Ki said.      “If there’s no spot USD inflows, no more bull runs,” Ki added.    Institutions wait and see    Institutions are pressing the pause button on their bitcoin purchases partly because many are trying to get a read from the new Biden administration’s attitude towards crypto-related policies and regulations. Negative comments on cryptocurrencies from new Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have raised some worries around possible added controls over the crypto markets.      Read More: Bitcoin Sells Off on Bearish Sentiment, Yellen Worries      Institutions ""are still trying to gauge where this administration would be on crypto and if it won’t be too negative, meaning that the fear of aggressive regulations or flat-out bans would be lifted, then I think we would see a new wave of institutions coming into the space,” Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director for multi-asset brokerage eToro, told CoinDesk.    Fear of the Wall Street Beats Redditors    Some retail traders are hoping what happened with GameStop Corp.’s volatile stock rally this week isn't repeated with bitcoin. In GameStop's case, ""a band of Redditors and Discord users squeezed the life out of their GameStop shorts by quadrupling share prices,” Adam James, senior editor at OKEx Insights, the research arm of crypto exchange OKEx, said.      He added, ""The realization that the legacy markets might not be what they used to be in the new stay-at-home paradigm [could] be affecting the bitcoin and cryptocurrency market, though I wouldn't exactly say they are bearish for the crypto markets.”      That said, some traders and analysts have remained positive on the markets despite the short-term market volatility.      “With bitcoin being unable to reclaim [previous] highs, some are losing faith,” Bendik Norheim Schei, head of research at the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research, told CoinDesk. “That is probably something they will regret later this year. Bitcoin is volatile, that's part of the game with a new and emerging asset.”      Chris Thomas, head of digital asset at Swissquote, told CoinDesk his company saw a support level setting at around $30,000, a level previously received “decent” support from buyers.      “For sellers who are not very speculative, it does not make sense to sell out around this level,” Thomas said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/26/bitcoin-falls-as-miners-sell-institutions-watch-yellen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fbc02cfc3267d1ff09aa0bfb9228a6f7a16f2398-678x448.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405771,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoXDF,1611691156,4 Ways Blockchain Could Catapult Into the Mainstream,"Revolutions are the product of the masses, not the elites.      Accordingly, we need to update the blockchain narrative to something more easily palpable for the average consumer and get on a path of attracting the millions of users.    William Mougayar, a CoinDesk columnist, is the author of “The Business Blockchain,” producer of the Token Summit and a venture investor and adviser.    Granted, the decentralized finance (DeFi) revolution is already on its way and poised to challenge traditional finance, but aside from DeFi what are some promising scenarios that could take the blockchain into mainstream experience? Let's flip blockchain’s promise on its head and think of mainstream users first.      Here are four usage scenarios that have a chance of being understood and adopted by mainstream consumers.    Earning by doing    Who wouldn’t like to be rewarded or compensated for their time, knowledge, data or hard work, whether online or not? Today, we have all become self-service slaves to a variety of online activities. Over the course of the Web 2.0 era, value capture shifted to the landlords who presented users with a buffet of actions. While these central players gave users some satisfaction and benefits, they reaped a lot more than they sowed or gave back.      Blockchains are money systems that transcend the real world. Of course, cryptocurrency is the perfect internet native currency, but cryptocurrency can also touch the physical world. It could usurp loyalty programs and provide users with a more fluid and universal currency.      See also: William Mougayar – We Still Lack a Rational Way to Value Tokens      Blockchains can reward people for taking actions just as consensus protocols reward computers for mining and validating transactions.      Steemit (now called Hive) users have already received $60 million in rewards since 2016. The Kin ecosystem (where I am an investor) grants a variety of earnings to users and developers, and has already dispensed over $15 million in rewards to its ecosystem of mobile App developers in the past two years.      Earning by doing will become a fundamental right. It is a general purpose capability, just as user-generated content was for Web 2.0.    Self-custody of value    We are used to storing valuables at home such as money, jewelry or art. However, when the value of these goods exceed what we can insure, or what we feel safe in keeping at home, we usually turn to banks or special custodians as more convenient safeguards for storing our liquid assets.      Cryptocurrency offers alternative storage options via personal wallets or easy on-ramps to exchanges or a new category of crypto custodians that possess their own secure vaults.      Today, many self-custody wallets already exist, allowing users to experience the self-service option for assets storage. Those same wallets also enable the storage of another blockchain novelty: “digitally unique” artifacts also known as non-fungible tokens (or NFTs; think CryptoKitties).      In the long term, banks and old-style physical storage services may not be the most popular or safest storage methods anymore. Being your own custodian is an attractive value proposition that comes with a degree of freedom and efficiency, as long as its relative ease of use and trust levels continue to improve. Many users will gradually de-bank their assets and move them into self-custody to take advantage of new services that are only available in the blockchain world.    Remote privileges    Our driver licenses give us an explicit permission to drive on public roads. A bank card allows us to withdraw money or initiate transactions. Our house key lets us inside our homes. You can’t fake one key for another just as you can’t use your friend’s driver license as a substitute for yours and you can’t access any one else’s account with your bank card.      What if there was a solid equivalent to all these “access” options online? What if blockchain technology (combined with our smartphones and biometrics) could be used to grant us a wide array of access privileges, both in the physical and online worlds?      See also: William Mougayar - For DeFi to Grow, CeFi Must Embrace It      The equivalent to the physical keychain holder will be a smart wallet that contains a variety of “special keys,” also known as tokens, that open access to a mix of activities, web sites or actually places. The software just needs to check that you have the proper “access right” in your possession, in the same way as when you pull a token from your pocket to retrieve your garment at a coat check, or rely on the electronic device in your car to automatically calculate and grant your toll payment when your car passes through.      Many of the same self-custody wallets will also allow us to vote on a variety of issues just as easily as opening a mobile app and posting a picture or sending a tweet.    Community empowerment    We live in an age of instant online connections, yet most of these interactions are optimized for the individual, not the group. We sign up individually to sites that recognize us as one unique person.      What if communities of similar interests were able to govern and rule themselves via clear and enforceable procedures such as voting, decision making and operational executions?      Today, we can do some of that via online community forums (e.g., Discord, Facebook Groups) or a variety of online chat platforms (e.g., Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal). But once these groups are formed, implementing governance and instilling enforceable systems that mirror the values of its participants is not so easily done.      Blockchain is perfect for empowering online community governance. Early versions already exist within DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), but a lot of work is still required before getting close to mainstream adoption, because these early DAO-based versions are quite geeky and assume that participants are steeped in technical capabilities. Newer apps to turbo-charge online communities are on the horizon.    Web 3 should not be technical    The above four use-cases are lighthouse beacons from which we can seek guidance. They are not perfect, but they are acceptable entry points that will usher us into a Web 3.0 era that is more about mainstream usages, and less about technical infrastructure jargon.      The blockchain world is full of big ideas. Beyond DeFi, the narrative needs to inspire a much wider segment of the population.      What if we could start earning real value by being online while also able to safely store what we earn? What if we became more efficient at self-organizing, while being empowered to also collectively act soon after?      These use cases already exist within several microcosms. Now the rest of the world must get inspired to move them into the mainstream.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,William Mougayar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/26/4-ways-blockchain-could-catapult-into-the-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74479d23aa15f3fcc91b3beff887da4aeeafbc99-1200x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 24-year-old proprietor of at least three crypto funds allegedly ran their value into the ground, losing millions of dollars for 170 investors. Spence tried to hide his losses by funneling over $2 million of newcomers' bitcoin and ethereum positions to old-timers in a ""Ponzi-like"" fashion, according to a complaint unsealed Tuesday in federal court.      He also fabricated account balances to show Coin Signals investors in the green, prosecutors allege. Spence once falsely told his investors they were up 148% in a single month, according to the complaint.      In doing so, prosecutors allege Spence committed commodities fraud and wire fraud. Those charges could add up to 30 years in federal prison if prosecutors secure a conviction and maximum allowable sentence.      Spence's crypto funds have landed him in hot water before. In 2018, crypto lawyer David Silver of Silver Miller Law filed a civil suit over the trader's alleged Ponzi scheme on behalf of 22 Coin Signals investors. Miller secured a summary judgment and $2.9 million in damages against Spence in mid-December.      ""We are pleased that after nearly two years, the government has finally indicted Mr. Spence to hold him accountable to his many victims,"" Silver told CoinDesk.

The online shopping giant that went in on crypto-hype will now spin out its blockchain-focused subsidiary, Medici Ventures, into a managed fund.    Overstock will remain a limited partner, with the venture firm Pelion Venture Partners taking lead over the $45 million fund, if approved. Overstock will also retain a direct minority equity interest in the blockchain technology firm tZERO Group.  Following the announcement, Overstock shares (NASDAQ: OSTK) were trading 11.28% higher at $75 in Monday’s pre-market session.    Janet Yellen is the 78th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Approved by the Senate on Monday, the former Federal Reserve chair will oversee an office with a host of crypto-related rules on its plate. This includes an 11th hour Trump administration proposal to increase surveillance of private wallets. The controversial, and perhaps illegally, short comment period on that one has just been expanded.    Yellen made a stir last week after raising “particular concerns” about cryptocurrency’s links to criminal activity. While she hasn’t spoken at length about the industry, she has expressed zeal for crypto's potential to “improve the efficiency of the financial system.”  Indeed regulators worldwide are expressing nuanced views of crypto, with Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey saying crypto (“as originally formulated"") has failed as a currency, but that digital innovation is here to stay.  “We’re right still to debate stablecoin, we’re right to debate central bank digital currency. Those issues, I think, are very much up for grabs,” he said, at Davos.    As BoE’s Bailey snubs crypto qua crypto, it’s important to note all the ways he’s already wrong. Crypto works for payments, though perhaps it’s not the first choice for plush “first world” economies. But it’s plenty powerful for those who are cut off from the financial system.    For instance, CoinDesk’s Anna Baydakova reports Alexey Navalny, Vladimir Putin’s most vocal critic, has raised 657 BTC in donations over the past five years.  And lest we not forget about Julian Assange and the dissident WikiLeaks nonprofit. To date WikiLeaks has received more than 14 BTC, not counting other crypto donations. Rachel-Rose O’Leary touched on the subject when discussing advancements in privacy tech, in a recent CoinDesk op-ed.  At stake    It’s all about the allocation...      Yesterday, it was reported that universities, including several in the Ivy League, have been quietly purchasing bitcoin directly on Coinbase for their endowments.      Harvard, Yale, Brown and the University of Michigan are among those thought to be buying, an anonymous source told CoinDesk’s Ian Allison. No university confirmed the rumor, several refused to comment. It’s currently unknown how well-endowed these university BTC holdings might be.      Harvard and Yale have $70 billion in assets between them, and the total endowment pot is estimated to be $600 billion as of 2017.      “If I had heard that three years ago, I would have said it was wrong,” said Ari Paul, co-founder of BlockTower Capital and previously an investment manager for the University of Chicago. “But a lot of institutions are now comfortable with bitcoin. They understand it and can just buy it directly, as long as it’s from a regulated entity like Coinbase, Fidelity or Anchorage.”      ARK Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood echoed that thought, saying she believes more companies will load their balance sheets up with bitcoin. She told Yahoo Finance on Saturday that several executives at publicly traded firms have broached the subject with her: Should we follow Square?      Square, the fintech darling led by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, purchased approximately 4,709 bitcoin in October. That initial $50 million investment is now worth roughly $150 million. MicroStrategy is perhaps the most visible public company that treats its cash reserves as waste water and bitcoin as its baby (it’ll never throw its BTC out with the bath). It now holds a total 70,784 bitcoin.      Rothschild Investment Corporation also increased its bitcoin exposure, buying 24% more shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, disclosed yesterday. The $1.4 billion investment manager isn’t holding bitcoin directly and has long experimented with holding and dropping bitcoin. (CoinDesk and Grayscale are both owned by Digital Currency Group.)      Funnily enough, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reports a Canadian VR firm bought BTC as a “long-term” investment, but sold last week apparently on false rumors of a bitcoin “double-spend.”      Institutional exposure isn’t limited to bitcoin as more and more legacy financial firms take an interest in ether (ETH), the native currency of Ethereum.      In its 2020 annual report, Coinbase noted “a growing number” of its institutional clients have taken positions in ether. “The case for owning ethereum [ether] we hear most frequently from our clients is a combination of, first, its evolving potential as a store of value and, second, its status as a digital commodity that is required to power transactions on its network,” according to the report.      Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital asset prime broker Bequant, told CoinDesk markets reporter Muyao Shen that some of this ETH buying could be an indirect way to get exposure to decentralized finance.      “Not everyone is comfortable with the risks that are still associated with DeFi, but the hyper growth of these projects boosts activity on the Ethereum network and, thus, supports capital appreciation,” he said.      Indeed, the total value locked in all DeFi protocols and applications hit a new high watermark of $26 billion on Sunday, according to DeFiPulse, primarily driven by ether’s price appreciation.    Market intel    Bitcoin has shed a few thousand dollars, dropping approximately 7% day over day, bringing the larger crypto market with it. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports that some $4 billion worth of BTC options are set to expire on Friday. It’s expected that Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, will set a new record of 102,162 contracts, worth about $3.5 billion, closed.    ""Over 80% of the Deribit-based Jan. 29 expiry open interest is set to expire out-of-the-money, or worthless,"" Godbole notes. This will likely cause volatility leading to month’s end, as traders hedge their positions. He breaks it down here.

42405775,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoXGC,1611679180,What Tether Means When It Says It's 'Regulated',"Tether, regulated or not?      Newcomers to the crypto space are quickly confronted with a popular distinction between regulated stablecoins and unregulated stablecoins. But what is the difference? Tether, the largest of the stablecoins, is often described as unregulated. But Tether executives and supporters disagree with this claim. Who is right?    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    Tether is the most popular medium of exchange in the crypto economy. With almost $25 billion worth of U.S. dollar tether stablecoins in existence, it has become one of the world's largest non-bank issuers of dollars. For context, there are around $32.5 billion worth of PayPal balances outstanding. It took PayPal 20+ years to get to this level. Tether did it in just six!      Tether’s story is even more intriguing as it has been dogged for years by speculation that its reserves are deficient. In fact, New York Attorney General Letitia James is currently investigating Bitfinex, a Tether affiliate, for allegedly violating New ‎York securities law by using Tether reserves to cover up losses.      For potential users of stablecoins, it’s easy to be confused by these mixed signals. Tether's incredible growth implies a high degree of market confidence in the stablecoin, yet persistent rumors about its reserves say the opposite.      See also: Questions About Tether Just Won’t Go Away. Does the Crypto Market Care?      One of the rules of thumb that anyone can use for establishing trust in a financial institution is the presence of regulation. Is there a neutral government body that supervises or regulates a financial institution’s finances? If so, that provides users with a layer of protection.      Unfortunately, even the topic of regulation can be confusing. Podcaster Laura Shin recently had a conversation with Deltec Deputy CEO Gregory Pepin, Tether's banker. Pepin was addressing recent accusations that Tether does not have a sufficient number of dollars in its bank account for each Tether issued. The conversation turns to regulation at 20:50 when Shin asks Pepin whether Tether is regulated or not:      Shin: Can you name a regulator for Tether?      Pepin: The regulator related to Tether, and related to Paxos and USD Coin and all of them, they're all registered FinCEN. And that means that for AML and KYC [anti-money laundering and know your customer], and that’s what matters the most because if you look at all the comments from Janet Yellen, it’s all about money laundering and terrorism. And at that level they're all regulated the same, they're all registered with FinCEN.      In his response, Pepin maintains that Tether is regulated. And he suggests that it is Tether's registration with FinCEN that imbues Tether with regulated status, putting it on par with its stablecoin competitors such as USD Coin, which are also registered with FinCEN. FinCEN, by the way, is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the US Department of the Treasury that defines rules for combating money laundering.      Paolo Ardoino, Tether's chief technology officer, has also made the same claim about Tether being on par with other stablecoins because it is “regulated under FinCEN.”      Tether's general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, has also made the same suggestion. In response to a question on Twitter about how Tether is regulated, Hoegner implies that it is Tether’s registration with FinCEN that qualifies Tether as a regulated financial institution:      So here we have a datapoint that might assuage the worries of crypto neophytes about Tether backing. Tether is regulated, so presumably users are protected.      Unfortunately, this claim is misleading.      Tether isn't regulated by FinCEN. Rather, it is registered with FinCEN. These two R words are quite different. When an institution is registered with FinCEN, this means FinCEN has provided it with an electronic account for uploading suspicious transaction reports (SARs) and $10,000 cash transaction reports (CTRs). As per FinCEN requirements, a registered entity must also implement measures for collecting and verifying the identity of customers.      While it is commendable that Tether has chosen to register itself with FinCEN, collect customer information and regularly file SARs, there’s nothing special about this status. Even Dale & Jackie's Discount Liquor in Decatur, Ill., is registered with FinCEN:      By the way, take a look at the disclaimer FinCEN tacks on at the bottom of Dale & Jackie's registration status. ""The inclusion of a business on the MSB Registrant Search Web page is not a recommendation, certification of legitimacy or endorsement of the business by any government agency."" In other words, neither Dale & Jackie's Discount Liquor nor Tether should be advertising its registration with FinCEN as a regulatory seal of approval. Yet, this is what Deltec and Tether executives seem to be doing on Twitter and in podcasts.      What neophyte stablecoin users need to understand is FinCEN doesn’t provide a financial regulatory framework for money services businesses like Tether, PayPal or Dale & Jackie’s. That is, FinCEN doesn't care about Dale & Jackie's capitalization or its net worth. It doesn’t check to see if the dollars that these issuers create are 100% backed.      We have a separate set of government institutions that vet money services businesses for capital adequacy and sufficient backing. In the U.S., the financial regulation of money services businesses is carried out by state financial services departments. (Here is a list).      See also: What Are Stablecoins?      PayPal, which I mentioned above, is regulated as a money services business in over 50 different U.S. states. Circle and Coinbase, which together issue the second-largest stablecoin, USD coin, are licensed by multiple state financial services departments.      Each state financial services regulator has its own rules, but in general they all require money services businesses to limit their investments to a range of permissible securities, to post a surety bond or letter of credit with the regulator as security, and/or to maintain minimum net worth requirements. Money services businesses must also provide their state financial services regulator with yearly audited financial statements and submit to examinations when required. State regulators often stipulate background checks on executives and directors in order to prevent fraud.      Stablecoins Paxos standard and Gemini dollar are regulated a bit differently than USD coin. Issuers Gemini Trust and Paxos Trust are licensed by a single state financial services department, the New York State Department of Financial Services ( NYDFS), to operate as limited purpose trust companies. To qualify, they are obligated to meet the same standards a bank would. (The requirements are here).      So PayPal, Coinbase, Circle, Gemini Trust and Paxos Trust all have the distinction of being able to tell the public the dollars they issue must adhere to a specific financial regulatory framework created for money services businesses. That is, customers have some guarantee that a regulator is setting quality standards for the dollars fabricated by these issuers.      Tether, by contrast, is not regulated by the NYDFS. Nor is it regulated by any other U.S. state financial services department.      We know that Tether has a connection to the Bahamas (Deltec, after all, is located there) but a quick check of the Central Bank of Bahamas (CBB) registry reveals that Tether isn't licensed with the CBB as a money transmission business or as an electronic money service provider. Tether is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, but a search of the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission, which regulates BVI-based banks and money services businesses, does not reveal Tether to be one of its regulated entities.      See also: Nic Carter - Nationalizing Stablecoins Won’t Improve Financial Access      So if Pepin, Ardoino and Hoegner want to assuage public worries about Tether’s reserves by claiming that Tether operates under some sort of financial regulatory framework, then they need to tell us: What exactly is the government body that is acting as the financial supervisor?      FinCEN registration should not be invoked in a debate over how financially secure Tether is. When it comes to questions about a money services business’s reserves, the pertinent regulator would be something like NYDFS or another state financial services department or the Bahamas central bank (which has a licensing framework for money services businesses). Only these regulators make it their job to check out a money services business’ financial statements, vet executives and directors and set rules about permissible investments. FinCEN doesn't.      It's not a sin to be an unregulated financial institution. There are plenty of well-run and legitimate money services businesses that do not operate under any particular financial regulatory framework. However, it is a sin for a financial institution to claim that its finances are regulated – and point to FinCEN registration as evidence for that – when in fact it does not adhere to any specific financial regulatory framework. That's false advertising.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/26/what-tether-means-when-it-says-its-regulated,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6746e7d6c440fba62a5a5bbe14e0d6590dadb32c-1200x690.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405776,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoXIA,1611676813,State of Crypto: Unpacking the Trump Presidency's Crypto Legacy,"Welcome to State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. I’m your host, Nikhilesh De.      A number of crypto issues are on deck as Joe Biden enters the second week of his presidency. This week’s edition of SoC looks at what now-former President Donald Trump left behind.      Click here to sign up for State of Crypto.    Where we’re at  Key narrative    Crypto grew rapidly over the four years Trump was in office – despite his own public admission that he is “not a fan” of bitcoin. While he wasn't directly responsible for this growth, the regulators he appointed and some of the policies his administration pursued undeniably boosted the crypto industry. After four years, here’s what his administration left behind.    Why it matters    The Trump administration was largely friendly toward the industry (with a few notable exceptions), and ushered in a wave of regulations and products that were welcomed by the crypto community. The Trump administration stopped short of actually setting a policy direction, however. Almost all of the crypto-friendly actions were conducted by the regulators he nominated to various posts, and no significant legislation on the crypto space was passed or signed into law.    Breaking it down  SEC: Light on the guidance    The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn’t published a ton of guidance, Commissioner Hester Peirce’s attempts notwithstanding. Mostly it came down to: initial coin offerings (ICO) and cryptocurrencies may violate securities laws, hit up the SEC if you have questions. Also, the SEC rejected like a gazillion bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, though there’s some renewed hope one will be approved in 2021. Here are some other memorable moments from the Trump era:    An SEC staffer asked the general public to “please stop asking” about bitcoin ahead of a decision on whether it will approve a bitcoin ETF in March 2017 (the SEC later rejected the ETF application).  The SEC published the DAO Report, arguably its most consequential guidance as far as the crypto industry is concerned. The report, which examines the DAO, an Ethereum-based funding vehicle, concluded federal securities laws might apply to certain cryptocurrencies and sales involving crypto.  The SEC spun up a new cyber unit to focus on crimes committed using cryptocurrencies and the dark web in September 2017.  The SEC announced in November 2017 that celebrity endorsements of ICOs might violate the law if the celebrities don’t disclose they’re being paid for their endorsements. In a stunning turn of events, it later filed charges against celebrities who didn’t disclose they were being paid for their ICO endorsements.  In January 2018, several companies withdrew their bitcoin ETF applications at the SEC’s request.  Dalia Blass, the SEC’s director of Investment Management, says valuation, liquidity, custody, arbitrage and market manipulation concerns all need to be addressed before the agency will approve a bitcoin ETF.  Also in January 2018, the SEC shared that it’s taking a look at companies that announced blockchain pivots. In an entirely predictable sequence of events, it later suspended trading in three companies that made such announcements.  The SEC appointed Valerie Sczcepanik, the previous head of its distributed ledger working group, as its senior adviser for digital assets and innovation in June 2018.  SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman says that, in his view, ether doesn’t look like a security. While this isn’t formal guidance, SEC Chair Jay Clayton later endorsed Hinman’s view, opening the door for Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Heath Tarbert to invite and approve companies looking to create an ether futures product.  In August 2018 the SEC rejected nine bitcoin ETF applications at once before announcing it was reviewing those rejections. Despite asking for public input on the applications in October, nothing more was said about them.  The SEC created FinHub, a division specifically focused on distributed ledger technology and other financial technology products. Valerie Sczcepanik was tapped to lead it.  The SEC charged decentralized trading platform EtherDelta’s founder Zachary Coburn with operating an unregistered securities platform, showing that decentralized exchanges (DEX) aren’t necessarily beyond the agency’s reach.  In April 2019, the SEC published a token framework explaining when a cryptocurrency might be a security in its view. Industry participants say it leaves many questions unanswered.  Also in April, the SEC published its first no-action letter allowing a company to legally sell tokens.  The SEC sued Kik over its 2017 kin token sale in June 2019. A judge ruled the sale violated U.S. law, and Kik later settled, paying a $5 million fine.  The SEC also sued Telegram over a $1.7 billion gram token pre-sale (it later won this case).  The SEC said some stablecoins may not be securities, but issuers should work with the federal regulator to ensure it isn’t in violation of any U.S. laws in September 2020.    In short, almost all of the SEC’s actionable guidance came via enforcement actions and informal warnings. What is clear is a) token sales may violate securities laws and b) the SEC will go after entities if it thinks there’s a violation.    CFTC: Light-touch guidance    During the Trump era, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the entrance of crypto derivatives products in the U.S., creating a regulated trading market in which institutions could participate. Here are the key points:    Cash-settled bitcoin futures (where traders receive the fiat equivalent to the contract’s value when it settles) launched in December 2017 (under the oversight of former Chair Chris Giancarlo).  CFTC General Counsel Daniel Davis authorized agency staff to hold and trade cryptocurrencies in February 2018.  A federal judge ruled bitcoin is a commodity and therefore subject to the CFTC’s enforcement supervision in a case brought by the agency against an alleged crypto scammer.  Physically settled bitcoin futures (where traders receive bitcoin when the contract settles) launched in September 2019 (under the oversight of former Chair Heath Tarbert).  The CFTC defined “actual delivery” for cryptocurrency contracts in March 2020, answering a long-running question about what it means for a customer to receive bitcoin earned through margin trading (the definition is later cited as Coinbase’s reason for ending margin contracts).  Physically settled ether futures launched in May 2020 (Tarbert).    Giancarlo, who was widely referred to as “Crypto Dad” during his time in office because of his advocacy for a light-touch regulatory framework, told CoinDesk in 2019 the approval and introduction of a bitcoin futures market helped pop the 2017 crypto bubble. Bitcoin’s price rose to nearly $20,000, what would have been an all-time-high at the time, but the price fell shortly after the first futures contracts were introduced to the U.S. market.      The former regulator now spends his time advocating for a U.S.-issued central bank digital currency (CBDC) as part of the Digital Dollar Foundation. His successor, Tarbert, gave the industry a shot of hope by explicitly calling ether a commodity, opening the door for derivatives products around the cryptocurrency.    OCC: Light-speed guidance    The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency wasn’t hugely involved in the crypto space for most of Trump’s term, outside of a legal fight over a fintech charter. It wasn’t until Brian Brooks got to the agency by way of an appointment by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the OCC really began making public moves relevant to the industry.    As First Deputy Comptroller, Brooks raised the idea of a nationwide charter for fintech firms, allowing them to bypass individual states’ money transmitter license requirements.  In July 2020, the OCC made waves by publishing an interpretative letter saying banks can provide custody services for cryptocurrencies.  The OCC published stablecoin guidance for banks, giving them cover to work with stablecoin issuers in a legally-compliant fashion in September 2020.  Fintech lender SoFi, which has a digital assets wing, received a conditional charter from the OCC in October 2020.  Brooks said banks may be looking to partner with or acquire custodians to enter the crypto market in October 2020.  The OCC began a rulemaking process to prohibit banks from not serving certain industries, including the cryptocurrency industry in November 2020 (this rule was finalized in January 2021).  The OCC published additional guidance in the form of an interpretative letter saying banks can use stablecoins for payments, as well as operate nodes on public blockchains at the beginning of January 2021.  Anchorage, a South Dakota-based crypto custodian, became the first federal crypto bank after the OCC granted it a conditional trust charter in January 2021.    The OCC moved so quickly under Brooks that several members of Congress felt the need to ask him to focus on other issues such as the coronavirus pandemic. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) also included all of the OCC interpretive guidance in a letter to incoming President Joe Biden listing Trump administration actions Biden should undo. Trump nominated Brooks to a full term running the OCC.    Biden’s rule    Looking ahead, here’s what the regulator landscape looks like as of right now. Most of President Biden’s nominees still need confirmation hearings and votes, so a lot of these departments have acting heads, particularly after several Trump-nominated heads stepped down. Fed Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s term doesn’t expire until next year. A few of the smaller Treasury Department agencies, including the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the lFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), seem set to continue with their incumbent directors. Janet Yellen was confirmed yesterday as Treasury Secretarty and sworn in late last night.    Changing of the guard  Elsewhere:  Janet Yellen Says Cryptocurrencies Are a ‘Concern’ in Terrorist Financing: Yellen’s comments raised a stir last week, with much of the industry indignantly pointing out that not a lot of crime is conducted using crypto and only a tiny fraction of crypto is used to conduct crime. Yellen’s written remarks, published two days later, showed a bit more nuance. Honestly, I don’t think we can draw any conclusions from her remarks last week because they were her first crypto comments in over two years. On the plus side: She has said she’ll review the FinCEN rulemaking Mnuchin tried to rush through.  Japan Rallies Behind XRP as Ripple Faces US Litigation: An interesting conflict inherent in crypto is that it’s supposed to be borderless and stateless, but it exists in a world that still has borders and states. We’re seeing what that actually means now, with the SEC suing Ripple on allegations it sold XRP in unregistered securities transactions. While the SEC might believe XRP is a security, that doesn’t mean other nations do. My colleague Sandali Handagama found that investors in Japan are (understandably) still fairly confident in XRP, particularly after an endorsement by local financial services giant SBI.  The Relationship Between US Government Debt and Bitcoin, Explained: So one of the tenets of the crypto twitterati is that inflation is bad, money printing is bad, sound money is good and deflationary currencies like bitcoin are very good. As it turns out, inflation in the U.S. has been pretty low. My colleague Nathan DiCamillo spoke to some economists, and while it’s entirely possible that inflation will rise in future “we’re not seeing it yet,” at least one told him. Nate’s conclusion: Bitcoin’s role as a hedge might not be imminent.  Outside crypto:  SEC Chair nominee Gary Gensler is likely to take the regulator in a sharply different direction than predecessor Jay Clayton did on a number of issues, including a rule on prohibiting conflict of interest for investment advisors and climate change, Politico reports.

42405780,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoXO4,1611674621,Tether Just Won't Go Away. Does the Crypto Market Care?,"Stablecoins are a key cog in the cryptocurrency machine. The recent bull market has rekindled a long-simmering debate over whether the biggest such coin is, well, stable.      While bitcoin, ether and altcoins have seen astounding price rallies over the past four months, some of the most important growth has been in the cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins. These blockchain-based assets, usually pegged to the U.S. dollar, are a critical part of cryptocurrency trading activity and have taken in billions from investors who use them on exchanges around the world.      The biggest of them all, tether, has an eye-popping $25 billion market capitalization. However, tether’s critics charge its lack of transparency in everything from finances to the way its issuing company operates threatens the overall crypto market.      At issue is one of the most fundamental questions hanging over the cryptocurrency markets: Is the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies inflated because the backing of tether may not be as strong as people think it is?    Why the market uses stablecoins    Despite hitting a $1 trillion market capitalization in January, freely floating cryptocurrencies, though more liquid than before, are still quite volatile. For example, for the past five years, bitcoin hasn’t been able to consistently maintain a 30-day volatility below 20% as gold does. This makes claims that bitcoin is “digital gold” a poor fit, which is where stablecoins come in.      Jeremy Allaire, chief executive officer of Circle, part of the CENTRE Consortium (with Coinbase) that manages USD coin (USDC), says cryptocurrency market traders need stablecoins to move quickly given constantly gyrating digital asset prices.      “If you're active in the markets, you're going to keep your money in a stablecoin because it's radically faster, cheaper, better than the legacy banking system,” he told CoinDesk.    See also: Tether Use on Tron Passes Ethereum as Low Fees Attract Small Transactions    Allaire’s USDC is in many ways the sort of transparent enterprise stablecoins promise to be. A top 20 crypto asset, it has almost $5 billion in market capitalization and $2.7 billion in daily trading volume as of press time. Every month, the CENTRE Consortium publishes attestations from accounting firm Grant Thornton LLP to prove the amount of USDC in circulation matches up with the amount of dollars in a bank account, meaning the asset is fully backed by dollars. In accounting-speak, attestations are different from audits. Auditing is defined as an independent examination of data, whereas attestations evaluate and review how true data is.      Just a year ago, USDC’s market capitalization was merely $445 million. It saw a tenfold rise as the crypto markets skyrocketed amid uncertain times.    The tethered kingdom    While USDC is one of the more successful stablecoins, it’s relatively small compared to its most formidable and controversial competitor, one that is dominating the sector. The largest stablecoin – and the third largest cryptocurrency – in the entire digital asset ecosystem is tether (USDT).      In the past year, tether’s market capitalization has risen from $4.2 billion to a whopping $25 billion. In a span of four days in 2020, from March 31 to April 3, its market capitalization jumped by $2.1 billion alone.      “We're not sure that anyone could have foreseen this level of growth and use cases of tether at the very beginning. We were confident that it was a useful token, but didn't anticipate quite how useful it could be,” Paolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer of Tether and the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, told CoinDesk      So far in January alone, Tether has plowed $3.8 billion more USDT into the crypto ecosystem.    Tether’s entanglements    It is true that Tether is likely an original. It is a project that started as Realcoin, founded in 2014 by entrepreneurs Brock Pierce, Craig Sellars and Reeve Collins. Nonetheless, many in the industry – and law enforcement – have questioned its legitimacy. Multiple ongoing investigations, including from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the New York Attorney General’s office, have dogged the stablecoin company. At the center of the DOJ’s criminal investigation into Tether as an organization is whether or not USDT is used to inflate the cryptocurrency markets.      Tether General Counsel Stuart Hoegner provided this statement to CoinDesk regarding the U.S. investigations: ""We work with regulators and law enforcement agencies around the world to help their investigations and help them understand our business. We always want to support law enforcement's legitimate objectives. With respect to the New York Attorney General's special proceeding, we believe that our discussions with their office has been constructive and we look forward to continuing the conversation.""    Read more: Bitfinex Says It’s Nearly Done Turning Over Documents to NYAG    Like USDC, USDT is closely associated with an exchange; USDC is used on Coinbase’s exchange and USDT is utilized on Bitfinex, although both are also used on other exchanges. But the behavior of the two assets on the two exchanges is quite different, according to data analytics firm CryptoQuant.      “Compared to bitcoin, there's no multiple stablecoin addresses for exchanges,” Ki Young Ju, chief executive officer of CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk. Because of this, Ki’s firm has been able to use data from exchanges to calculate what it calls a “stablecoin ratio.” The calculation is the bitcoin reserves from known hot wallets in U.S. dollar (USD) terms divided by the stablecoin reserve addresses exchanges. The higher the ratio, the higher the selling pressure.      “The ratio for stablecoins like USDC is like 18%-25%,” depending on the exchange, said Young Ju. “But tether is just 7%, meaning most of the demand didn't come from exchanges.”      So where is the demand coming from? While USDT does have a transparency page on its website showing assets and liabilities, it does not appear to provide a regular attestation from any third party that the amount of USDT in circulation matches a bank account somewhere.    Tether’s backing questioned    John Griffin, a professor at the University of Texas, wrote with Amin Shams, a former student who is now a professor in the Department of Finance at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, the academic peer-reviewed paper “Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?”      The 2018 paper said one entity, demarcated in the paper with a single bitcoin address, exerted a remarkable amount of control over the bitcoin bull market in 2017 by minting tether that was then used to buy bitcoin. “We find that one large player is associated with more than half of the exchange of tether for bitcoin at Bitfinex, suggesting that the distribution of tether into the market is from a large player and not many different investors bringing cash to Bitfinex to purchase tether,” according to the research.      The report added that very little tether is returned to the issuer to be redeemed, suggesting the crypto market is at least somewhat inflated by the USDT used by that address to buy bitcoin during the 2017 bull market time period.      Bitfinex/Tether did not respond to specific inquiries regarding the paper, which was updated in 2019. However, in a blog post they slammed the study.      “We have now reviewed the updated Tether article by John M. Griffin and Amin Shams,” begins a Bitfinex blog post from Nov. 7, 2019. “The purported conclusions reached by the authors are built on a house of cards that suffers from the absence of a complete dataset.”      In response, Griffin and Shams disputed that a complete dataset wasn’t used and said blockchain data is easier to obtain for analysis than most realize. They also said it took them a long time to parse and verify all the data to come to the conclusions they did for peer review and publishing.      “One of the things that our paper found is that tether was being printed unbacked and being used to push up cryptocurrency,” Griffin told CoinDesk. “At the time that we printed our paper Tether rigorously denied that.”      However, Hoegner, Bitfinex’s general counsel and who also represents Tether, conceded in an affidavit filed in a case brought by the New York Attorney General that at least as of April 2019, Tether assets circulating in the crypto ecosystem were only 74% backed by cash and cash equivalents. The case alleges Bitfinex lost $850 million and subsequently used funds from Tether to secretly cover the shortfall.      When asked by CoinDesk to provide specific information regarding redemptions and issuances, Bitfinex’s Ardoino gave this answer: “Much of the information for which you're looking is available on public blockchains. The data shows that demand for redemptions is far surpassed by the demand for issuances.”      In 2018, the DOJ’s Criminal Division awarded Griffin’s forensic data analysis firm, Integra FEC, $400,000 for “Tether Investigation,” according to a previous version of the contract’s webpage. On Dec. 27, 2020, the contract was updated to reflect completion before the end of 2021, although there is no longer any reference to Tether on the site.      Shams, Griffin’s collaborator on the paper, doesn’t have any involvement with Integra FEC and told CoinDesk he has not taken any money for his research. He says the paper was well-received in the academic community but believes, like Griffin, that it should be taken more seriously in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, especially given the rigorous peer-review process.      Shams noted the paper was published in the Journal of Finance, which according to statistics on its official website, has accepted only 4.38% of submissions since 2016. ""It's by far the best finance journal,"" he said.    Tether’s surprising defender    An unlikely defender of tether is CEO Allaire. He is one example of a longtime participant in the cryptocurrency community who isn’t convinced tether has undue influence on the crypto market.      “I think what I can say is the academic theory that they have run a giant fraud to create tether out of thin air, to buy bitcoin, to drive up prices, I think that's complete BS,” Allaire told CoinDesk. “If you want to deploy capital into the markets, you do it through stablecoins and then you go bring those dollars into the markets and you buy things and trade things.”      ""In particular in Asia where, you know, these are dollar-denominated markets, they have to use a shadow banking system to do it,"" Allaire said. “You can't connect a bank account in China to Binance or Huobi. So you have to do it through shadow banking and they do it through tether. And so it just represents the aggregate demand. Investors and users in Asia - it's a huge, huge piece of it.”      When Allaire refers to “shadow banking” he’s talking about a term created back in 2007 by an economist to refer to unregulated or lightly regulated non-bank financial institutions. The problem is, shadow banks are not backed by typical FDIC insurance to protect deposits in the U.S. Also, shadow banks were singled out as nefarious participants in the 2008 financial crisis.    Read more: Tether’s Bank Deltec Says Stablecoin Is Fully Backed by Reserves    When asked about how Tether helps those without proper banking, Ardoino says the liquidity component of USDT is key to the crypto exchange ecosystem. “Tether allows for a more efficient experience across exchange platforms and in digital token commerce more generally,” Ardoino said. “Tether realized early on the importance of a common asset in the crypto ecosystem that can be used seamlessly across multiple blockchains and communities to access and provide liquidity.”      However, Griffin compares problems with tether to traditional financial markets and highlights a gap the stablecoin still has to bridge.      “Having a stablecoin and using stablecoins in the space is a good idea, but you need to have a stablecoin that undergoes proper auditing and proper monitoring,” Griffin told CoinDesk. “It would be equivalent to saying, ‘Hey, let's make an [exchange-traded fund] in the U.S. on the Russian ruble,’ and then you got the North Koreans and [Russian President] Putin manipulating the ruble,” he said. “And then you wonder, like, well, ‘I wonder why the ruble went up so much this weekend?’”    ‘A partial-reserve stablecoin’    Kevin Lehtiniitty is the chief strategy officer of Prime Trust, a Nevada-based trust company that has worked extensively with stablecoins. The firm, as a financial institution, has developed a “stablecoin as a service” product for the crypto market, providing custody, payments and instructing of the minting and burning of stable tokens for exchange.      “We were the first financial institution to be a stablecoin as a service provider,” Lehtiniitty told CoinDesk. “Basically the exchange is a technology layer on top of the stablecoin.”      Prime Trust has worked with over 38 stablecoin products, the first being the venture capital-backed TrueUSD in 2018. “Now, obviously, 38 stablecoins are not going to win,” said Lehtiniitty. “It's going to be kind of like a winner or top two or three take all kind of a market.”    Read more: What Tether Means When It Says It’s ‘Regulated’    Lehtiniitty did not mince words on his thoughts about stablecoins without transparent asset backing, calling tether a “partial reserve stablecoin.” “I think the general market sentiment, at least from our perspective, is that people know that – people just don't think it's going to crash when they are doing what they are doing.”      “What are the odds that it's going to crash in the next few hours that I'm holding?” Lehtiniitty continued. ”And that's what is the world's dumbest excuse. But I hear it time and time again from OTC and trading partners, other folks, and it drives me nuts.”      Yet, it likely would take a loss of tether’s peg to the dollar for anyone to even raise any alarm because market forces appear to be keeping prices in line, according to another paper, funded by Ripple, called “What Keeps Stablecoins Stable?” by Richard K. Lyons of University of California, Berkeley and Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj University of Warwick.      That paper argues that traders are helping stabilize prices around the peg. And while tether’s peg to the U.S. dollar hasn’t dipped in quite some time, it has happened before, the paper points out.      “A lot of very well capitalized people believe that tether is better off existing than not,” Lehtiniitty said. He pointed to the May 2019 $1 billion LEO token offering Bitfinex conducted as an example. “They were willing to put their money where their mouth was to the tune of a tremendous amount of capital to keep tether propped up,” Lehtiniitty added.    Regulators making moves    In the U.S., the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) has said this month that federally regulated banks can use stablecoins for payments and other services. Also this month, the U.K. released a paper and request for commentary on the use of stablecoins in finance.      All of this, Lehtiniitty suspects, is to build a framework around stablecoins backed by banking in an effort to weed out possible systemic risks that partial-reserve stablecoins like tether may cause should a peg break.      “The only way tether kind of stops and we then go to fully backed stablecoins is regulatory pressure. And what I mean by that is basically saying banks can deal with fully reserved stablecoins, not with other types of stablecoins,” he said.      In a recent video interview, Gregory Pepin, the deputy CEO of Tether’s bank, Deltec, said, “Every tether is backed by a reserve and their reserve is more than what is in circulation.”      More trouble for Tether as an organization looms on the horizon. A federal criminal trial involving real estate investor Reggie Fowler, who was involved in allegedly providing Tether and Bitfinex with shadow banking at one point, is underway in New York. In the case brought by that state’s attorney general, key documents were supposed to be provided by Bitfinex and Tether by Jan. 15. And the DOJ’s Criminal Division investigation is ongoing with Integra’s contract running until the end of 2021.      Even USDC’s Allaire regards Tether as pretty non-transparent. “They're very opaque about a lot of things,” he told CoinDesk.",NEUTRAL,USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDT,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/26/tether-just-wont-go-away-does-the-crypto-market-care,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0c1814c5f02df1f46da3ee9472a4644945e126d-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Signal is actively developing payment features relating to a Stellar-based, privacy-focused cryptocurrency called MobileCoin, a project advised by Signal CEO Moxie Marlinspike, Platformer said Tuesday.      Like the Facebook-backed Diem (formerly Libra) project, MobileCoin has been touted internally as a way to make it easier for people in developing nations to move money around, per the report. The app is also said to be working on allowing customers to have unique usernames amid concerns about its current use of mobile phone numbers as the basis for accounts.      However, employees at the firm fear the additions may open the app up to abusive behavior and bring negative attention to the app and encryption technologies from regulators, Platformer said.      A crypto payments feature is seen by staff as risky because it may draw criminals onto the platform, while usernames run the risk of impersonators and scammers. There are also concerns Signal may be failing to develop policies on how to handle bad actors.      “The world needs products like Signal but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher at Signal, told Platformer.

42405774,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoXHB,1611673243,Big Guns Back $10M Investment in DeFi's dYdX,"Trading venue dYdX has raised $10 million in a Series B funding round led by Three Arrows Capital and DeFiance Capital.      The platform, launched in 2017, offers a spread of decentralized trading products including both bitcoin and ether derivatives. The San Francisco-based startup plans to use the funds to increase its product offering, further decentralize its platform and increase its presence in China, according to a blog post shared in advance with CoinDesk.      ""dYdX was the first [decentralized finance] app I ever used and I am elated to have the chance to invest in [it] today,” Three Arrows Capital co-founder Su Zhu said in a statement.      Three Arrows was joined by a lengthy roster of crypto investors in the Series B, including Wintermute, Hashed, GSR, SCP, Scalar Capital, Spartan Group and RockTree Capital. The round was also joined by previous Series A investors Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital.      The trading platform has had a gangbusters year with trading volumes across spot, margin and perpetual contracts jumping fortyfold – from $63 million in 2019 to $2.5 billion in 2020, the firm said.      Margin and spot trading made up the lion’s share of that activity clocking in at $1.9 billion for the year. The startup released its BTC and ETH perpetual products – which operate similarly to a futures contract but without a set expiry date – in May and August 2020, respectively.    Gunning for growth    To date, dYdX’s impressive growth has been overshadowed by other DeFi products such as Compound Finance and Uniswap.      Indeed, DeFi Pulse ranks dYdX as the 18th-largest DeFi market by total volume locked (TVL) at $150 million.      In a bid to climb the DeFi rankings, dYdX is introducing rollups, a technology designed to increase throughput and reduce gas fees. High gas fees on Ethereum have hamstrung young DeFi markets in recent months.      The dYdX solution involves a product based on StarkWare’s Cairo software and is expected to be rolled out in February.      ""Our goal is to become one of the largest crypto exchanges – period. To accomplish this we’re building a Layer 2 system with StarkWare enabling cross-margined perpetuals, allowing for significant improvements to trading at scale,” dYdX founder Antonio Juliano told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

42405767,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoX9J,1611673200,"Galaxy, Coinbase Bet $25M on DeFi Using Terra Stablecoins","Terraform Labs has raised $25 million in a new round from Galaxy Digital, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital and others.      The stablecoin for e-commerce creator has already proven people will use its volatility-free tokens in decentralized finance (DeFi) to buy synthetic stocks, and plans to attract blockchain denizens to even more use cases.      ""We look forward to using the funds for building key pieces of infrastructure in the Mirror Protocol for synthetics, Anchor Protocol for savings and other killer DeFi applications to make Terra's algorithmic stablecoins the centerpiece of the decentralized finance movement,"" Terraform's co-founder Do Kwon said in a press release.      Terraform Labs is behind a platform for minting different stablecoins for e-commerce that mimic the value of various fiat currencies. It's also behind the Chai payments app, an e-commerce wallet that's widely used in Asia and powered by stablecoins.      ""The Terra ecosystem has brought the benefits of programmable money to commerce and will do the same for finance,"" Pantera Capital's Paul Veradittakit said in a press release.    Read more: ‘Clicks and Bricks’ Strategy to Drive Korean Users to Terra’s Blockchain    Previous investors Hashed, Arrington XRP and Kenetic Capital also participated in what Terraform Labs is calling a ""growth fundraising round.""      ""Terra has already made a successful payment case for more than 2 million users in the Korean market, and is also rapidly growing in the DeFi space,"" Simon Kim, CEO of Hashed, said in a press release.      Founded in 2018, with a co-founder behind one of South Korea's larger e-commerce sites, Terra launched with $32 million in backing from Binance and Polychain, among others. Each Terra stablecoin (such as TerraUSD or the one tracking the South Korean won, TerraKRW), relies on the system's LUNA token to maintain its peg.      LUNA is the governance token for the blockchain, as the white paper explains. It is minted and burned in order to enforce the peg for any Terra stablecoin, so the governance token absorbs the volatility to defend its stablecoins' utility.    DeFi catalyst    Most entrepreneurs on Ethereum agree that DeFi Summer never would have happened had stablecoins not proved they could stay stable.      The Terra stablecoins are notable because they operate outside the Ethereum ecosystem, the platform most associated with DeFi. Terra's blockchain is Tendermint-based, making it part of the larger Cosmos ecosystem.      Terraform says its blockchain generates $13 million in fees annually. Its payments system, Chai, has 2 million users and sees $1.2 billion in transaction volume using its TerraKRW stablecoin, which tracks the price of the South Korean won.      Last summer, Terraform teased a DeFi savings platform called Anchor, which generates a better interest rate for savers by backing proof-of-stake networks. Originally slated for October 2020, it's currently projected to go live in the first quarter of 2021.    Read more: Proof-of-Stake Chains Team Up to Prove DeFi Is Bigger Than Ethereum    ""On Anchor the protocol work is done but we are doing integrations with a well-known partner so we can launch together. Almost there,"" Kwon told CoinDesk in a followup email.      Terraform also dropped a new synthetic equities market last month called Mirror. This enables anyone anywhere to buy tokens that follow the price of any equity in the U.S. stock market.      The new funding will be used to expand those use cases, build new DeFi projects that use its tokens and extend its interoperability to additional blockchains, Terraform said.

A break above $35,000 could mark a ""potential trend reversal, giving hope to the bulls,"" the Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm Arcane Research told clients Tuesday in a report. ""A break of the $30K support will probably see the price fall down to the $26K-$27K area.""      In traditional markets, European indexes were higher, bolstered by a flurry of corporate dealmaking announcements, despite a spreading coronavirus caseload, the prospect of stricter containment measures and rioting in the Netherlands.      U.S. stock futures fluctuated after congressional leaders said passage of President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion relief package might not happen until mid-March. Gold weakened 0.3% to $1,850 an ounce.    Market moves    The roster of cryptocurrency buyers keeps expanding, with endowment funds for some of the most prestigious U.S. universities now reportedly nosing in.      Funds for Harvard, Yale, Brown and the University of Michigan have quietly been buying cryptocurrency for the past year or so through accounts held at Coinbase, CoinDesk's Ian Allison reported Monday, citing two sources familiar with the situation. Harvard has the largest university endowment of any with over $40 billion in assets, and Yale is close behind with more than $30 billion.      It's a key development because digital-market analysts say growing interest from big institutional buyers has been a major factor in bitcoin's quadrupling in price last year, with another 11% gain just in January alone.      While the university allocations likely represent a fraction of a percent of their total assets, the news reveals yet another potential source of demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at a time when corporations and money managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity have been lapping it up.      Based on the most recent data from the U.S. Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. university and college endowments had assets with a market value of about $600 billion as of 2017.      As First Mover has discussed previously, the corporate treasuries of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks represent a $2.3 trillion money pot of cash and short-term investments that could conceivably be at least partially allocated to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.      And just since October when Square, the payments company helmed by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, announced it would put some $50 million, or 1% of its assets, into bitcoin, the number of corporate treasurers and fund managers following suit has expanded rapidly.      At that time, according to the handy website bitcointreasuries.org, there were just 60,927 BTC in corporate treasuries and professionally managed funds, valued at $619 million. The amount has since swelled to 1.22 million bitcoin valued at about $39.7 billion.      The developments keep coming:    Marathon Patent Group, a bitcoin mining company, disclosed Monday it bought $150 million of bitcoin for about $31,100 apiece during the cryptocurrency's recent rout. As reported by CoinDesk's Danny Nelson, the Nasdaq-listed firm said it bought the cache through the digital-asset manager NYDIG.  CoinShares, the digital-asset manager, reported Monday its weekly tally of inflows into cryptocurrency investment products hit a record $1.3 billion last week. The recent price weakness in bitcoin ""looks to have been a buying opportunity,"" according to the firm.  Rothschild Investment Corp., a Chicago-based money manager of $1.4 billion, disclosed Monday t had nearly $1 million of shares as of year-end 2020 in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), run by the CoinDesk sister company.  ARK Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, an exchange-traded fund magnate and outspoken bitcoin advocate, said in a Jan. 23 interview with Yahoo Finance that large companies have asked her if they should invest in bitcoin as an inflation-hedging strategy. “I think we’re going to hear about more companies putting this hedge on their balance sheet,” she said.    And it's apparently not just bitcoin these big players are after. As reported Monday by CoinDesk's Muyao Shen, there are indications the recent rally in ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has been fueled in part by institutional buying.      Some of them are even dipping into the exotic, fast-growing and often risky arena of decentralized finance, known as DeFi – an interlocking array of semi-automated trading and lending platforms that entrepreneurs, coders and even hobbyists are assembling with blockchain technology and open-source software.      “The more adventurous institutions are exploring Ethereum and DeFi after they looked at bitcoin,” Arthur Cheong, founder and portfolio manager at DeFi-focused crypto fund DeFiance Capital, told Shen.      With the smartest money – literally – now buying cryptocurrencies, it's hard to imagine more institutional players won't follow. (We're looking at you, pension funds with $4 trillion.)      “I’d imagine there are a few big names we don’t yet know of currently buying up bitcoin,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital asset for Swissquote Bank, as reported Monday by CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey. “We’ll likely discover them very soon, by which point they will have accumulated quite substantial volumes.”      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin options worth $4 billion are set to expire on Friday, potentially exacerbating price swings as January draws to a close.      Some 120,300 contracts are due for expiration on Friday on major exchanges Deribit, CME, Bakkt, OKEx, LedgerX, according to the data provider Skew.      Much of that amount can be found on Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange by trading volume: It's on track for a record monthly bitcoin options expiry of 102,162 contracts (nearly $3.5 billion).      At current price levels, more than 80% of the options open interest would expire out-of-the-money, or worthless. But if the bitcoin market starts moving in the next few days, big players might be forced into new hedging transactions, which could give rise to more significant price turbulence.      “If BTC rapidly jumps to all-time highs within the next few days, it’s expected market makers will aggressively hedge their out-of-the-money short call option exposures, which would likely increase overall market volatility and momentum in the underlying price,” Samneet Chepal, quantitative analyst at the quantitative and systematic digital asset investment firm Ledger Prime, told CoinDesk.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Large Bitcoin Options Positions May Boost Price Volatility This Week    Token Watch    Ethereum (ETH): Balances on crypto exchanges fall to 15-month low of 15.4M ETH, in positive sign for price (Decrypt)      XRP (XRP): Ripple lawyers hope to engage with Gary Gensler on U.S. SEC suit, assuming he's confirmed as the securities regulator's new chair (WSJ)    What's hot    Collateralized debt obligations make their way onto DeFi lending (CoinDesk)      It's 'frothy squared' as crypto firms line up for IPOs to tap market mania (Bloomberg)      Novogratz's Galaxy Digital to launch Ethereum funds (Decrypt)      Winklevosses' Gemini exchange adds local currency, DeFi tokens in Singapore expansion (CoinDesk)      Shariah-compliant crypto exchange wins license from Bahrain's central bank (CoinDesk)      Market value of DeFi tokens surges to $45B, triple the amount at end of October (Decrypt, CoinGecko)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    Small-investor stock-trading activity on Robinhood, Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley's online brokerage shows no sign of slowing (WSJ)      GameStop short-sellers reload bets after $6B loss (Bloomberg)      World's largest movie-theater chain, AMC, nets $917M in financing to ward off bankruptcy (WSJ)      ""With the U.S. increasingly reliant on foreign capital to compensate for its growing shortfall of domestic saving and with the [Federal Reserve's] open-ended quantitative easing measures creating a massive overhang of excess liquidity, the case for a sharp further weakening of the dollar looks more compelling than ever,"" former Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Stephen Roach writes in op-ed.

42405773,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoXFD,1611670743,FinCEN Further Extends Comment Period for Controversial Crypto Rules,"The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is further extending a comment period for a controversial proposed rule that would require crypto exchanges to gather and store counterparty information for transactions to unhosted wallets.      FinCEN announced the move Tuesday, saying all comments are due 60 days after the change is submitted to the Federal Register, the U.S. government's logbook. The move is a victory for the crypto industry, which has complained the previous deadline of 15 days was far too short. FinCEN previously extended the comment period by 15 days for a proposed currency transaction report rule and 45 days for the counterparty data collection rule.      The rule was proposed at the end of 2020 and would have placed an undue burden on exchanges to collect the names and addresses for individuals who own unhosted or private wallets. The industry pushed back on the proposal, claiming it might break decentralized finance applications and create a data honeypot that would put personal information at risk.      The currency transaction report aspect would require exchanges to file reports for transactions that are worth over $10,000 per day. This rule would be identical to existing bank requirements for fiat transactions, though there are questions about whether wallet addresses would be included in these reports.      The counterparty rule would be more difficult to comply with.      ""All comments to the NPRM will now be due 60 days from the date of publication of this Extension Notice in the Federal Register,"" Tuesday's notice said.      Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was confirmed Monday evening by the U.S. Senate. The FinCEN proposal was one issue she was asked about prior to the vote.      “I am aware of the rules proposed by FinCEN in December 2020 regarding how certain digital assets are treated under the Bank Secrecy Act,” she said in a written response. “I agree on the need to ensure adequate consultation with and input from stakeholders. If confirmed, I intend to ensure a full and substantive review of the proposals, which will include an assessment of how to ensure proper input from stakeholders.”",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/26/fincen-further-extends-comment-period-for-controversial-crypto-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c878e00618c72891fbd22dfe2f6749fd4ebf866-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42405764,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoX6M,1611669660,Traditional Lenders Extended Millions in Loans to the Crypto Space Through Genesis in Q4,"Several institutions are parking their idle cash on Genesis Capital’s balance sheet, the cryptocurrency lender and trading firm announced in its fourth-quarter earnings report Tuesday.      Over the period, the total volume of Genesis’ active loans outstanding increased by 81% to $3.8 billion, while loan originations increased by 46% to $7.6 billion. The average U.S. dollar or stablecoin loan size to Genesis doubled from $2 million to $4 million in the fourth quarter, and the average loan size for first-time lenders on the Genesis platform increased from $590,000 to $3.2 million.      Genesis, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.      These results are in line with observations by economists who've noted that institutions are saving more and investors are searching for yield amid a low interest rate environment that will persist during the pandemic-induced recession.      “The space is just bigger,” Genesis CEO Michael Moro said. “We’ll see more and more people buying from the spot market for the first time, borrowing and lending for the first time … the hope is to continue to be able to unlock more supply, that we will be able to get more traditional lenders lending dollars into the crypto space, to hopefully keep interest rates under control.”      While bitcoin and ether continue to take up a larger share of the loan book pie, Genesis still saw increased demand for dollar loans “mostly from market neutral types of hedge funds and prop trading firms as they are able to continue to arbitrage the spot and the futures market,” Moro said. This stood in contrast to Genesis’ Q3 report which showed ETH loans rapidly increasing after the summer’s DeFi craze.    Read more: ETH Gobbles Up Larger Share of Genesis Loan Book as Trading Firms Feast on DeFi Summer    BTC is now around 54% of the pie and ethereum 15.5%, compared to 40.8% and 12.4% respectively at the end of the third quarter. XRP has shrunk to 0.4% of the portfolio, down from 1.4% after Genesis chose to stop borrowing and lending in the cryptocurrency in the wake of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) suit against Ripple.      In the earnings report, Genesis called on central banks to include stablecoin data in their datasets. Moro described stablecoins as derivatives on the M1 money supply (M1 includes very liquid monies such as cash, demand deposits, and traveler's checks; M2 includes less liquid money like savings and time deposits, certificates of deposits, and money market funds).      “You have to have a U.S. bank account to access U.S. dollars,” Moro said. “The advent of stablecoins have made it so that the remote farmer in the middle of India can have USDC if they have an Ethereum address. You have increased the accessibility of U.S. dollars globally which I don’t think people have thought about.”      Moro said he predicts central banks around the world are going to be wary of their citizens having easy access to the dollar and that the U.S. Federal Reserve is going to avoid having a dollar that is too strong, which would lead to an export/import imbalance if U.S. goods become too expensive for other countries to purchase.      “I don’t think you can put the USDC genie back in the bottle,” Moro said. “Once you’ve done the USDC route it’s really hard to kind of go back. … It’s literally telling people, this fantastic thing, you can’t do it anymore, and go back to the bank wires.”    Derivatives rise in the bull market    Genesis’ derivatives trading desk also saw record volumes last quarter, with traders looking to hedge their risks as they got into the bull market.

The investigators requested data and transaction details from 2017 to 2019.  According to CoinDesk Korea, the National Tax Service may conduct such special investigations if it spots anomalies between actual transaction data and reported data, or if it suspects tax evasion.  In April, the Korea Digital Exchange renamed its crypto trading platform from Dexko to Flybit.

Overstock explained Monday that blockchain-focused Medici Ventures will be converted into a limited partnership under the new management following legal and regulatory approval.  The new fund will have a capital commitment of $45 million with an eight-year life.  Pelion Venture Partners, which invests in early-stage startups, will be the general partner of the fund and Overstock will be a limited partner in the fund.  According to the partnership agreement terms, the fund will return invested capital to Overstock first and then split profits on successful exits.  “We remain bullish on blockchain technology but are changing the way we interact with these assets. As we evaluated how to create the highest return for our shareholders, we determined it is time to partner with a seasoned venture capital firm to oversee the portfolio and make follow-on investment decisions,” said Overstock CEO Jonathan Johnson.  Under the new terms, Medici Ventures will no longer provide software development and design services to its portfolio companies.  Overstock will retain a direct minority equity interest in the blockchain technology firm tZERO Group, while the fund will hold a minority ownership stake.

They will also need to align with the central banks existing rules for financial service providers in areas such as liquidity and operational risk, IT risk, internal controls, consumer protection and anti-money laundering.      VASPs will now need a minimum capital requirement of 50 million Philippine pesos (just over $1 million) if they provide custody services, or a lesser amount of 10 million pesos ($208,000) if not.

Suspicious activity or single transactions of 50,000 pesos (US$10,000) will need extra due diligence and payout restrictions, said the BSP.

42385754,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBO6iR,1611651168,What Is Guggenheim Partners?,"Guggenheim Partners is a privately owned global investment and advisory firm with headquarters in Chicago and New York.      Originally founded by the Guggenheim family back in the late 19th century, the investment firm currently manages over $295 billion in assets and provides a range of insurance, capital markets and real estate advisory services. In 2019, the company was the lead counsel during the $34 billion Redhat IBM acquisition – one of the biggest software deals in history.  More recently, Guggenheim Partners has turned its attention to the rapidly expanding digital currency space and voiced particular interest in one crypto asset.    Guggenheim Partners Wants In on Bitcoin    On Nov. 29, 2020, Guggenheim publicly announced it had filed an amendment with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enable it to allocate approximately $500 million worth of its Macro Opportunities Fund to Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). This institutional product allows large financial players to buy and sell shares of a fund that exclusively holds bitcoin in excess of 616,588 coins. (Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.)      On Dec. 17, 2020, Guggenheim Partners CIO Scott Minerd stated it was the company’s belief “that bitcoin should be worth about $400,000 … based on the scarcity and relative valuation such as things like gold as a percentage of GDP” during a Bloomberg TV interview.      A few months later, however, Minerd outlined his short-term concerns for bitcoin’s unsustainable price action during an episode of CNBC’s ""Closing Bell""program. The Guggenheim CIO commented, “I think, for the time being, we probably put in the top for bitcoin for the next year or so. And we're likely to see a full retracement back toward the $20,000 level."" This sentiment reflected one of his earlier Twitter posts that mentioned bitcoin was becoming vulnerable to a setback and that it was “time to take some money off the table”.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Ollie Leech,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/26/what-is-guggenheim-partners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8a994edad6107768296b6bea1c8f4c96aadb28f-1024x681.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
