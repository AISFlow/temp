42421435,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDPR,1668959100,Crypto Markets Are Suffering ‚Äì but Is It Really ‚ÄòContagion‚Äô?,"So we‚Äôre now roughly two weeks removed from the start of the FTX meltdown. The coverage on CoinDesk has been without peer.  Here are the biggest FTX-related stories from last week by my count:  FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried says ‚ÄúF*** regulators‚Äù in a Twitter Direct Message interview with Vox.  The new CEO of FTX, John J. Ray III, who led Enron through bankruptcy and is leading FTX through its own, wrote about FTX that he has never ‚Äúseen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information.‚Äù  Alameda Research, the crypto hedge fund which was joined at FTX‚Äôs hip, had a ‚ÄúSecret Exemption‚Äù from FTX liquidation protocols, basically a ‚Äúgod mode‚Äù button, as CoinDesk contributing editor Zack Seward put it, so as to not lose money when it should have.  But beyond topics directly related to FTX, let‚Äôs discuss this contagion ‚Äì this crypto credit contagion ‚Äì everyone seems to be talking about.  You‚Äôre reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Crypto credit contagion is contained to crypto  Financial contagion is used to describe a crisis which spreads from one market or economy to another. An example: Home prices started falling in 2006, by September 2007 Lehman Brothers collapsed because of losses associated with subprime loans and then a lot of people lost their jobs (like a lot).  This contagion was a credit contagion that spread everywhere. The reason these types of things happen is because of the complicated web woven among the countless financial institutions selling and buying countless financial instruments among each other. When one part of the web breaks down, other parts of the web start breaking down until all you‚Äôre left with is a shredded mess.  This is very clearly happening within crypto. Since the FTX fallout began we‚Äôve had crypto lender BlockFi halt withdrawals from its platform citing exposure to FTX, then another crypto lender Genesis Global Capital also halted withdrawals, and then Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange Gemini shut down its Gemini Earn program which offered yield to customers through, you guessed it, crypto lending through Genesis.  (Genesis Global Trading is part of Genesis Global Trading and is owned by Digital Currency Group [DCG]. DCG also owns CoinDesk.)  Oh, what tangled webs we weave.  But here‚Äôs something different between the 2006 credit contagion and the 2022 FTX-induced crypto credit (which is what lenders do, they extend credit) contagion. The 2006 credit contagion led to a global financial crisis which was probably the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression. Crypto is simply not big enough to have a serious impact on the broader economy.  Don‚Äôt believe me?  Here are some proof points:  On Thursday, Nov. 10, the U.S. Labor Department reported the consumer price index (which helps measure inflation) slowed to ‚Äújust 7.7%,‚Äù which was below expectations, so the S&P 500 (a stock price index) shot up from $3,760 to over $4,000 by the next day and is now sitting around $3,950. Bitcoin experienced a similar price movement, moving from $16,000 on Thursday to over $18,000 by Friday. The difference being that bitcoin‚Äôs price now sits around $16,600 as of writing.  On the day of the FTX collapse, most mainstream publications were more focused on covering something else: U.S. midterm elections. I know this is anecdotal, but you‚Äôll just have to trust me on this one.  Companies in general are still more concerned about supply-side recessionary pressures. The only companies talking about crypto are crypto companies (and maybe Twitter‚Äôs new owner).  I‚Äôm not suggesting that the crypto credit contagion is not bad. In fact, it is bad. A lot of regular people have lost money. Even the Ontario Teachers‚Äô pension fund lost $95 million investing in FTX (although that is only <0.05% of the fund's total net assets). But in totality it really isn‚Äôt as bad as some might make it out to be. I believe this crypto credit contagion will be contained to crypto, which would by definition disqualify it as a contagion at all.

42413646,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlADKO,1668950560,FTX Exploiter Converts Millions in Ether to Alameda-Linked Ren Bitcoin Tokens,"Whoever was behind the $600 million exploit of crypto exchange FTX started exchanging millions of dollars worth of ether to ren bitcoin (renBTC), a token that represents bitcoin on other blockchains, early on Sunday.  Funds stolen from FTX were steadily converted to ether over the past week, making the exploiter one of the largest holders of the token, as CoinDesk previously reported.  The use of renBTC may surprise some in the crypto space: In 2021, Alameda Research ‚Äì the Sam Bankman-Fried-owned trading arm at the center of a multibillion-dollar scandal ‚Äì said ren‚Äôs development team was ‚Äújoining‚Äù Alameda and would work on expanding ren‚Äôs usage to several blockchains.  At 07:27 UTC Sunday, the hacker moved over 5,000 ether to a new wallet, blockchain data shows. An additional 35,000 ether was then moved to that wallet over three separate transactions.  On-chain analysis of the new wallet shows the exploiter subsequently started to convert ether to renBTC using the decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch. The first of such transactions had 4,000 ether being converted to wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), another bitcoin representative token, and then to renBTC.  The exploiter continued to convert ether to renBTC over several transactions, blockchain data shows.  Data cited by security firm PeckShield shows the exploiter used the Ren bridge to transfer out thousands of renBTC. Bridges are blockchain-based tools that allow users to exchange tokens between different networks.  As per a study by blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, the Ren bridge has been previously used to launder stolen funds to the tune of at least $540 million ‚Äì as it may provide privacy to users, per the Elliptic report.
