Speaking at the CryptoCompare London conference Tuesday, Boerse Stuttgart's chief digital officer, Dr. Ulli Spankowski, admitted he had been ""surprised"" by the positive effect 5AMLD had on attracting traditional financial institutions into cryptocurrencies.      ""I actually didn't think anything would happen because banks and other financial institutions could already do crypto custody [and] could do crypto trading,"" Spankowski said. But since the law came into force earlier this year, ""we now see a lot of interest from the traditional players as well.""      AMLD5 requires crypto companies based in European Union (EU) member states to register with local regulators, introduce know-your-customer and hold information on clients' source of funds.      Some regional crypto players announced plans to leave the EU's jurisdiction soon after the directive came into effect back in January. Options exchange Deribit moved from the Netherlands to Panama, complaining AMLD5 placed ""too-high barriers"" for the majority of its clients. A week later, non-custodial exchange KyberSwap announced it was moving from Malta to the British Virgin Islands.      Boerse Stuttgart had listed a handful of crypto financial products on its main trading platform, but only fully entered the cryptocurrency space in September when its subsidiary, Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange (BSDEX), launched a bitcoin-euro spot trading pair.      ""Apparently crypto is now not bad and illegal and if the regulator says you can have a license for it, it must be legit,"" Spankowski said. With 120 institutional clients and an ""open relationship"" with the chief German financial regulator, BSDEX can now act as a trusted ""gateway"" for the digital asset class.      ""We could be the gate opener [for crypto] ... because the traditional financial industry is already connected to us on a European scale,"" Spankowski said.

42404149,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSf0,1583873710,"Here's Another, Surprising Reason Why Crypto Prices Fell – Derivatives","The traditional markets' recent sell-off drove cryptocurrency prices down, but the way it did so was more complicated than even many of the most sophisticated players in crypto were able to grasp. That’s because crypto’s drop was staged in the derivatives markets.       Financial instruments like futures and options make up derivatives markets, where value derives from, and is dependent on, the value of an underlying asset, in this case cryptocurrency. Coupled with a massive sell-off in the cryptocurrency markets, derivatives also contributed to recent declines in price.      In just 48 hours from March 7 to March 9, bitcoin (BTC) fell 17 percent from $9,215 to a fresh two-month low of $7,628.      As the S&P 500 tumbled 7 percent Monday, traders took to selling, not buying, crypto to deal with their own cash shortfalls.      “The crypto industry is reacting to the traditional market dump,” said Mostafa Al-Mashita of Secure Digital Markets, a Canadian crypto brokerage firm.      The effects of traditional markets on crypto befuddled many cryptocurrency stakeholders. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, one of the most regulated and bank-friendly exchanges on earth, appeared to be taken aback at the way market dynamics within cryptocurrencies panned out.       What Armstrong and other long-view cryptocurrency holders perhaps don’t realize is the impact derivatives trading has on “thin” or low-liquidity markets like cryptocurrencies.      Selling pressure in cryptocurrencies can create a cascading effect that is hard to recover from. Traders on derivatives exchanges like BitMEX and Deribit must contend with auto-liquidation.      Such a margin call-like event happens after there is intense spot market selling of cryptocurrencies for much-needed U.S. dollars on exchanges like Coinbase.      “As people lose discretionary income and short-term liabilities get called in, all risky assets are correlated on the downswing for the short term and that includes both traditional markets as well as crypto,” said Kevin Zhou, CEO of algorithmic trading firm Galois Capital.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/10/heres-another-surprising-reason-why-crypto-prices-fell-derivatives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e3fd7b1d3ade05a37e0d19b2711b4fb8aed4fd7-1110x788.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404143,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSZ6,1583871921,Bitcoiners in Europe Reflect on Economic Shocks as Coronavirus Spreads,"With assets from oil barrels to bitcoin being pulverized by the coronavirus slowdown, people worldwide are reevaluating their plans for crypto gatherings, especially in geographies where anti-COVID-19 measures are increasingly serious.      In Milan, Italy, which was officially placed on lockdown by the Italian government on Sunday, bitcoin entrepreneur and meetup organizer Mir Liponi is facing more pressing concerns than her hobbyist meetup of 1,800 members. Weddings and funerals are forbidden, she told CoinDesk. Most grocery shopping is done online, which leads to delayed deliveries.      “Authorities told us we will always have food and drugs,” she said. “That has been true for the last 18 days. ... But still people are scared. Some are breaking into shops.”      Meanwhile, veteran bitcoiner and cypherpunk icon Amir Taaki, known for creating Dark Wallet and fighting ISIS in Syria, is still hoping to open a cypherpunk academy in Barcelona later this year, after the virus quarantine policies end.      “People are still severely underestimating the impact this thing [coronavirus] is going to have. People are home a lot more, so using credit cards a lot more,” Taaki said in a phone interview from his quarantine in a small Spanish village. “Governments are going to give themselves more powers that they can use for other purposes.”      In the meantime, he’s working from home with the privacy tech startup Nym and, separately, with a small band of roughly 10 people to develop tools for “pools of liquidity in different jurisdictions.”      “What’s the point in building an ecosystem that centers around U.S. banks and Chinese corporations, then when the economy has a meltdown they pull out anyway? It's all backwards,” Taaki said.      In Milan, Liponi said the psychological aspect of quarantine already feels restrictive. People are only allowed to drive within the city for crucial work tasks, health care or groceries. She described the local health care system as “collapsing,” with doctors and nurses falling ill and hospitals woefully understaffed.      “Things change every day,” Liponi said. “I'm a reclusive person by choice but now that it's imposed I feel like I want to break free.”      There’s also a travel restriction on Italians. For example, they are no longer allowed to enter neighboring Austria. In Vienna, a hackerspace co-founder who goes by Exiledsurfer is organizing the virtual Noncon conference in April. A member of the cypherpunk collective Parallele Polis, Exiledsurfer said many bitcoiners rely on such events for work. It remains to be seen if the economics of virtual events can substitute for in-person gatherings.      Regardless, the risks of continuing to hold events in cities without quarantine rules could be severe. Several veteran Ethereum community members reported feeling sick this week after flying home from a conference in Paris. Even in San Francisco, which declared a state of emergency in late February, companies like Coinbase adopted a suggested work-from-home policy effective March 9. Bitcoin Magazine’s annual conference, which was scheduled for March 27 in San Francisco, was postponed to the third quarter of 2020.      For meetup organizers in complete lockdown like Liponi, she’s staying focused on the day-to-day and isn't sure yet how this will impact her international consulting company, Satoshi Design. Like Taaki and Exiledsurfer, she can work from home as she figures out her family’s situation.

42404145,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSb4,1583865139,"The Cryptocurrency Act of 2020 Is 'Dead on Arrival,' Washington Tells Sponsors","An omnibus bill aimed at comprehensive reform of U.S. cryptocurrency regulation was introduced Monday by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.). It is thought to have little chance of passage at present but, according to lawyers and backers in the industry, it does provide insight into what a top-to-bottom new law governing crypto could look like one day.      Marshall Hayner of Metal Pay and Erik Finman, who became a millionaire from bitcoin (BTC) before the age of 18 and now runs an investment fund, contributed to the discussion draft.      Presented on March 9, the “Crypto-currency Act of 2020” sets out to define categories of digital assets and clarify which federal agency will oversee each tranche.      “The bill looks to provide not only clarity but legitimacy to crypto assets in the United States,” said Will Stechschulte, Gosar’s legislative assistant, in a press phone call.      See also: ‘Youngest Bitcoin Millionaire’ Willing to Stake it All on Metal Pay      Regulatory uncertainty hangs like a cloud over the industry as it aims to attract conventional investors. Fully 56 percent of financial advisers cite “regulatory concerns” as reason not to invest in the nascent industry, a recent Bitwise survey found.      “Regulatory uncertainty has certainly been a shackle around the ankle of U.S. investors,” Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics and a former eToro analyst, said. “Many projects are simply choosing to move elsewhere.”      While there are existing proposals aimed at providing clear guidance – such as the Token Taxonomy Act and Securities and Exchange Commission member Hester Peirce’s “Safe Harbor” proposal – Gosar’s bill is the latest to take a holistic approach to crypto regulation.    ‘It’s difficult for a member to move a bill in a committee of which he’s not a member, doubly so if he’s in the minority,’ Brito wrote in a blog post.    The bill divides digital assets into three categories: crypto-commodity, crypto-currency and crypto-security with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Secretary of the Treasury via the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) overseeing each, respectively.      “While the bill makes sense on the surface,” a deeper look reveals that its neat categorizations are potentially fatal flaws, said Lawson Baker, head of operations and general counsel at TokenSoft. A Bloomberg legal analyst said much the same, claiming an early draft of the bill “displays a lack of basic understanding of the relevant federal laws and regulatory agencies.”      Debate over the bill’s efficacy and overreach started in mid-December, when a draft version leaked. Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, directed criticism at the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Gosar, who does not sit on the committees that might discuss his bill.      “It’s difficult for a member to move a bill in a committee of which he’s not a member, doubly so if he’s in the minority,” Brito wrote in a blog post. He now says the bill should be opposed on principle, if it shows any signs of life.      “It’s dead on arrival,” Kristin Smith of the Blockchain Association, said after reviewing the latest version.      Following its introduction on the floor late Monday afternoon, Ben Goldey, Gosar’s representative, said the bill will now pass to a committee for review. “Usually within the first week it will get assigned, but I suspect Financial Services [Committee,]” will take it up, Goldey said. Finman suggested it may be reviewed first by the House Committee on Agriculture.    It’s dead on arrival.    Whether the bill passes or not, its sweeping ambition is already redefining the scope of crypto regulation. Attempting to simplify the issues around cryptocurrency and its relationship to the larger economy, the bill is an example of why it’s so hard to define what crypto is and how it should be treated.      CoinDesk spoke with lawyers, investors and the bill’s writers about how the bill takes on crypto’s big regulatory issues and likely goes too far.    Regulators’ remit    Gosar’s bill defines crypto-commodities as an “economic good or service, including derivatives that have full or substantial fungibility; the markets treat with no regard as to who produced [them;] and rest on a blockchain or decentralized cryptographical ledger.”      This broadly defined concept would include bitcoin, ethereum, and any digital asset with free-floating valuations. The bill would also place these commodities under the purview of the CFTC. However, as Robert Kim, a Bloomberg legal analyst noted: the CFTC does not regulate commodities themselves, but derivatives traded off them.      “The CFTC indicated early on that virtual currencies, such as bitcoin are commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act. However, that does not mean they regulate the day-to-day activity of spot exchanges,” said Donna Redel, board member of New York Angels and a professor at Fordham Law and Fordham Gabelli School, said. “Do they have the capacity to review that? The regulators themselves would have to see what’s feasible here.”      See also: Lawmakers Reintroduce Bill to Exempt Crypto Tokens From US Securities Laws      Similarly, FinCEN was selected to oversee “crypto-currencies,” despite not actually regulating currency. Marshall Hayner of Metal Pay thinks that’s a pedantic statement.      “When you launch a crypto product and deal with stablecoins, you're dealing with FinCEN,” he said in a phone call. “Anti-money laundering requirements are top of mind for any firm that wants to remain compliant.”    Easy definitions    Lawson Baker, head of operations and general counsel at TokenSoft, a technology company automating finance by porting financial assets onto blockchains, noted that the definition given to “crypto-securities” by the bill does not capture real-world use cases of blockchain technology.      The proposed definition: ""all debt and equity that rest on a blockchain or decentralized cryptographic ledger,” makes sense in some contexts, Baker said, but in reference to traditional assets misses the mark.      For example, there's mortgage debt that could be issued on a blockchain. “Under [the bill’s] rules, a tokenized mortgage would be a ‘crypto-security’ requiring registration with the SEC absent an offering exemption,” Baker said. “As we all know, mortgages are already regulated by state and federal banking laws and not the SEC.”    My gut says we should stay nimble right now and define later. Read: push regulators to provide rule updates or additional guidance.    Likewise, Redel pointed out that even broad definitions may not allow projects room to breathe. She pointed instead to Hester Peirce’s proposal for a safe harbor for token projects, which grants three years exemption for projects to decentralize.      “The digital asset industry is constantly evolving,” Redel said. “Any effort of legislation has to take into account future innovation in the space and what else happens in the coming years. It’s not good to bet on a horse race if you don't know the players.”    Blockchains evolve    Under the Act, a ""decentralized cryptographic ledger"" refers to a ""ledger that (A) runs as a stand-alone blockchain that is secured through a minting mechanism."" As Baker notes, “This definition presumes all cryptocurrencies will operate on blockchains and public ledgers, completely ignoring how privacy coins like Zcash will operate in the future.”    Wider economy    Mati Greenspan takes a realistic view. While clearer frameworks may bring in entrepreneurs, investors and traditional financiers standing on the sideline of crypto, decisions to invest are also impacted by the larger mechanizations of the economy.      “Sentiment is way down due to the effects of the [Corona] virus and most people aren't exactly in an investing mood lately,” Greenspan said.      Likewise, Nic Carter, a venture capitalist with Castle Island Ventures, said crypto is “an asset class that’s really just an outlet for gambling.” Adding, these “excesses of crypto [are] definitely a function of our stage in the economic cycle.”      Carter adds that clear guidance for tax liabilities are also necessary, which the bill fails to address.    ‘Stay nimble’    What good is an omnibus bill if it cannot pass? What about more focused approaches for that matter?      The Token Taxonomy Act was successfully introduced, but was ultimately stalled during the review period. While Erik Finman is confident that his bill will pass, “I’m not even considering failure as an option,” he said, a similar situation is likely to transpire here.      “The optimum way to regulate the industry would be for the agencies to come up with a robust set of rules,” Donna Redel said. “This is preferable than the slower process of adjudicating and then waiting for the agencies to catch up. But the courts will, hopefully, always be there to provide guidance.”      While this process is slow, and companies may lose time and competition, Redel is skeptical that any prescriptive law could cover all the facets of the industry.      Josh Lawler, a partner at Zuber Lawler, agreed. “Looking at various statutory schemes, most don't work. The Swiss system doesn't work, really. Some are better than others, but it's not that easy to get a comprehensive plan.”      “My gut says we should stay nimble right now and define later. Read: push regulators to provide rule updates or additional guidance under current definitions rather than unintentionally redefine the scope of an agency's regulatory jurisdiction,” Lawson Baker said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/10/the-cryptocurrency-act-of-2020-is-dead-on-arrival-washington-tells-sponsors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81f1a0dee94ad41c616eca062bd0effcc124574d-2560x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404137,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSSD,1583863203,Bithumb Taps Chainalysis for FATF-Grade Crypto Investigation Tool,"Cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb is clamping down on suspicious transactions less than a week after South Korea, its home country, moved to enact tough new laws for the virtual asset space.      Bithumb announced Tuesday it had deployed Chainalysis’ “Reactor” investigations tool to get ahead of illicit activity. Reactor, used in many cryptocurrency law enforcement actions, will help the exchange’s compliance officers police their network, according to a press release.      The announcement follows the South Korean National Assembly's early March vote to amend the Special Financial Transactions Information Act, which, once signed into law, will force all virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to register with the government and submit to an internet security certification program. Bithumb is one of the few South Korean VASPs to have already completed both aspects.      The National Assembly’s vote brings its money transmission laws more in line with the Financial Action Task Force’s recommendations around VASPs last year, ahead of a June deadline for countries to comply.      But the 12-month deal with Chainalysis also addresses the spate of recent hacks against Bithumb, a historically hack-ridden exchange that has lost tens of millions in crypto – and in a country, South Korea, that has become an exchange raider’s billion-dollar honeypot.      “They had an immediate need for Reactor to manage their hack last year, and wanted to focus on boosting their investigative skills,” said Chainalysis’ Head of Communications Maddie Kennedy.      Many private-sector crypto companies partner with Chainalysis, though not always for Reactor. Tether uses “Know Your Transaction” to build risk profiles, as does Bittrex, Binance and some 150 other VASPs around the world, by Chainalysis’ own count.      Kennedy said Bithumb and Chainalysis are now in talks to provide KYT, too.      Other above-board Korean VASPs are also gearing up for the new regulations.

42404139,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSVA,1583859669,This Is What a Productive Congressional Blockchain Hearing Looks Like,"For once, U.S. lawmakers had an informative conversation about blockchain technology without posturing.      The House Committee on Small Business hearing last week lasted only an hour, and only four members asked questions. But in some respects it was far more productive than an eight-hour hearing of the larger Financial Services Committee might have been.      It was a sharp contrast from past Capitol Hill proceedings, when lawmakers took their entire allotted time to compare Libra to terrorist attacks or ask pointed questions about how Silicon Valley is biased toward one partisan slant or another. Rather, the small-business hearing saw only detailed questions about the legal or practical implications of blockchain and distributed ledger technology.      The specific question at hand was how small businesses might be able to use blockchain technology for data storage or fundraising. Ranking member Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) asked if blockchain has any areas which need to be worked out prior to mass adoption. Protocol Labs’ Marvin Ammori answered that user interfaces are probably the key holdup. Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) asked how blockchain can protect personal information and records. PopComm’s Dawn Dickson said an individual can more selectively grant access using blockchain.      Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.) opened the hearing by saying that while cryptocurrencies are the obvious use case people associate with blockchain, it is not the only one.      “Much of the power of the internet is concentrated in a few multi-billion dollar companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon,” she said. “Blockchain technology can help small businesses compete on a more level playing field.”      The witnesses likewise focused on practical applications.      “Blockchain is not a silver bullet, but it can solve problems that small businesses face,” said Dickson, whose company provides software services to retailers.      Next steps    Dickson told CoinDesk after the hearing she felt it was a positive experience, noting that she had been invited to testify as the operator of a small business.      Perianne Boring, who leads the Chamber of Digital Commerce trade group, said the hearing was a step forward in relations between Congress and stakeholders in the private sector.      “The next step is to create incentives for cooperation between companies that access and develop blockchain applications and government agencies focused on helping small businesses innovate and grow,” she said.      Jim Harper, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, described the hearing as another advance in Congress’s push to better understand cryptocurrency and blockchain.      “Agencies and committees are thinking through the details,” he said.      Taxation is probably the largest regulatory issue that needs to be tackled, however, Harper said. The Internal Revenue Service has not published much guidance around taxing crypto, particularly cryptocurrencies being used for spending.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/10/this-is-what-a-productive-congressional-blockchain-hearing-looks-like,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/956436096886467cfa6e243643a10a9d1799cb5d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404152,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSfz,1583857800,"Libra Wanted a Currency, All We Need Are DeFi's Open Payment Rails","Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Future of Finance newsletter.      As I write this, Facebook is worth about $500 billion in market capitalization. The other members of the Libra Association (and the 1,500 other organizations interested in connecting to it) are probably worth another few $ trillion. Ethereum, on the other hand, is only about $20 billion in value. And yet, there are profound reasons why we should be paying attention not to regulatory movement around Libra, but to decentralized finance brewing on the open source network.      See also: Lex Sokolin: Software Ate the World, Here’s How It Eats Finance      The key mainstream piece of news is that Libra's approach to building its currency and payments network is likely to change as a result of governmental pressure. What started out as a desire to build a multi-currency portfolio of dollars, euros and other Facebook-selected moneys ended up running into the wall of sovereign opposition. While bitcoin (BTC) faces a similar wall, it is permissionless and therefore too squiggly to shut down. Not so with Facebook. We know exactly where its shareholders and operators are. As a result, we observe that you cannot create a new money without a new nation (e.g., Anon or 4chan nation). And if you live within another nation subject to its laws (e.g., the U.S.), well, you are subject to its laws.      There continues to be a deep confusion about (1) an asset itself and (2) the operating infrastructure on which it travels. These are two entirely different propositions, and the difference cannot be hand-waved away. The nature of holding some investment and the exposure it gives you to the investment class is very different from the software on which it runs. The dollar and sterling may go up and down in value relative to each other – but that doesn't have much implication for the quality of the venue on which the trading occurs. Facebook was trying to do the former activity – re-build the actual dollar in a regulated, controlled environment.    Facebook was trying to...rebuild the actual dollar in a regulated, controlled environment. Instead, it should be rebuilding the payment rails.    Instead, it should be rebuilding the payment rails, which is why it is no surprise the Libra Association quitters are the companies that make payment rails: Stripe, PayPal, Visa and MasterCard. Those players are probably open to channeling new units of value across their super highways, but they shouldn't want to build competing ones. Once it becomes clear that the new unit of value ain't happening, what's the point of eating your own tail?    Astute JPMorgan report    JPMorgan recently published a fantastic equity-research style report on 2020 blockchain. There are a few connected, worthwhile points on the idea of cryptocurrency as an asset class worth referencing. First, if you are building the money itself, you are in the finance business and are taking economic exposure. That means, for example, that global yield curves become a problem. If 33 percent of global debt has negative interest rates, it might be hard for you to earn net interest income to sustain operations, which in turn may require customers to pay transaction fees on transfers, which gets you back to the existing banking/payments system already in place. To fix the math, you would need to build out a real capital markets business, which has at-scale liquidity networks, counterparties that can provide credit, and the buy-in of all the central banks in the system. That's a tough one for Facebook today.      Another conclusion I found compelling is the ongoing discussion about the diversification usefulness of digital assets. On the one hand, many people still hold the view that bitcoin is an apocalypse hedge and should go up when the entire world burns down. Hoard the digital gold next to your video game guns! However, the track record on this claim is not particularly clear as of yet, and correlations tend to creep up with global markets as shocks become more systemic. For example, bitcoin correlation with the S&P 500 and Gold both approached 30 percent at one point in 2019.      The JPMorgan takeaway is that crypto assets can be country fragility hedges rather than general hedges. In advanced nations, they represent novel and different idiosyncratic risks related to technology adoption curves, internet meme virality, and the mood of Federal Reserve and other officials. But nations with challenged economic and financial infrastructure offer clearer proof points for economic improvement.      Which gets me back to the core point: Stop thinking about the asset, and start thinking about its gears and engines.      DeFi is a bigger revolution, potentially    While the political responses to Libra are shifting influence and technology approaches, Ethereum is where the experiment is already happening. It boasts 88 million unique addresses (i.e., accounts), over 40 million smart contract calls in February (i.e., a request to/from a software), and nearly a million smart contracts created in the same month (see more growth statistics about it here.) An increasing amount of capital is being used as collateral – ""locked"" in the parlance of the industry – to power new financial machines.      Further, the two charts here (above and below) show you the user growth, evolution, and interconnectedness between an emerging blockchain-based financial software industry (i.e., DeFi) between 2018 and 2020. Digital currency is collateralized on the right, invested across lending products in the middle, and then sent to multiple trading and derivative exchanges on the left.      There is growth in the number of service providers, their specialization, and their users. There is also growth in the connection between these services, and the economic activity between them. This is both a strength and weakness. Systemic risk comes from too much interdependence. But so do network effects and a community.      As more activity from real world economies is able to shift to public blockchains, this snapshot could be the seed from which the financial machine emerges. Of course, that transition is a massive assumption, and to date much of the economic activity of the digital world remains digital and aloof. However, there is evidence of movement.      See also: Lex Sokolin: We Made No Progress, Other Than All the Progress We Made      As you research these issues more deeply and think about the new software providers, do not treat them as investment managers, creating streams of return. The mistake would be to evaluate the investment quality of some particular subscale network token as unattractive and miss the bigger picture. You might spend too much time thinking about the Ethereum token, and not about its ability to power an asset allocation software like TokenSets (social trading) or PieDAO (roboadviser). To that end, the visualizations below give you the directionally correct comparison of a technology enabler, rather than the asset itself.      The stunning thing about each of these offerings is not just that they are targeting a familiar use-case. Of course they are! Human nature does not change. Rather, it is that they target these use-cases while running on a common software infrastructure, being interoperable, and open source.      To repeat – we are a stone's throw away from the global financial industry running on a common software infrastructure across asset classes, being natively interoperable and open source.

42404144,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSa5,1583852430,This USV-Backed Startup Has a Solution for Buying Information With Confidence,"Numerai is opening its Erasure protocol to the world.      Erasure is a smart contract on Ethereum for people to share information and to express confidence about that information by putting money behind it. So far, Erasure has only been used by Numerai itself to buy predictions for its hedge fund. Now the startup has created Erasure Bay, a marketplace for information, launching today.      The internet has been amazing as a place to post and share information, but ensuring the veracity of that information has proven tricky. Crypto keeps taking stabs at addressing this and the latest attempt comes from Numerai, a startup backed by Union Square Ventures.      ""Erasure Bay is a place to request information and to tell information, and to trust the person you are doing the business with. To trust a counterparty in a way that you haven't been able to trust people before,"" Numerai’s Jonathan Sidego told CoinDesk.      Numerai launched in 2015 and created the numeraire (NMR) token in June 2017. Launched as an ERC-20 token and distributed via airdrop, Numerai sold $11 million in tokens in a round led by Paradigm and Placeholder last year.      How it works    Erasure Bay is a two-way marketplace. Users can either post requests for information (""I want to know who Satoshi really is"") or post information they have for sale (""I know who Satoshi really is."")      Of course, anyone could do this anywhere, the problem is how do you know you can be confident in the information? The Erasure protocol has a solution for this that may not be guaranteed, but it would definitely increase confidence.      The secret to having confidence in information purchased on Erasure Bay is a built-in process called ""griefing."" In short, griefing is a way both for the seller to express confidence in their information and for the buyer to inflict pain on the seller if they aren't satisfied.      ""The blockchain has only proven useful for one thing so far and that's proving one person has some amount of money,"" Sidego said. Erasure Bay proves someone has money they will back their information with. ""It's a simple way of putting skin in the game without a middle man.""      The stakes are ultimately in NMR, but users will post them in dai, the stablecoin whose value is pegged to the U.S. dollar. When griefing occurs, the dai is converted to NMR so the dai doesn’t get destroyed.      Numerai isn't taking a cut or charging for sales on Erasure Bay. The only way it would benefit directly from the new product is from gradual reductions in the NMR supply, boosting its value.      Building a network    Of course, a marketplace like this is only as good as the participants in it, so the company needs to get eyeballs on the protocol.      To drive attention to it, Numerai is linking everything that happens on Erasure Bay to a Twitter account that will post all new offers and also griefing incidents.      Looking down the road, accounts that use Erasure Bay frequently will start to develop a reputation. Reputation scoring won't be live early on, Sidego said, but the feature is planned for later. Reputation will be one more factor for signaling trust in the information on offer.      The team expects early users to post bounties for leads for hiring candidates. That seems like the most obvious place to start, but other markets could soon develop. People could post bounties for leaks from software or film studios, for example.      ""There's a whole bunch of places where people just setting down money would change everything,"" Sidego said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | AIRDROP,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/10/this-usv-backed-startup-has-a-solution-for-buying-information-with-confidence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/252598a356bb6f24aea4d1b838a6f268eec550a6-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404150,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSgy,1583852412,Bitcoin Options Saw Record Volume of $198M  Amid Recent Price Drop,"Trading volume records in bitcoin’s options market were smashed on Monday as investors scrambled to hedge their positions amid the sell-off.      Major exchanges – Deribit, LedgerX, Bakkt, OKEx, CME – registered total trading volume of $198 million, surpassing the previous record high of $171.3 million reached on Feb. 11, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew Markets.      Deribit, the world’s biggest crypto options exchange by volume, contributed nearly 86 percent, or $170 million, of the total trading volume on Monday. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) traded $2.1 million, while Intercontinental Exchange’s (ICE’s) Bakkt did not trade any contracts. Bakkt last registered activity on Feb. 27 and prior to that on Feb. 12.      An option contract is a derivative based on the value of an underlying instrument that gives the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the specified amount of an underlying asset on or before the expiration date. A call option gives the holder a right to buy, while the put option gives the holder the right to sell.      “Derivatives trading activity tends to increase when a large spot move occurs, which was triggered yesterday by an extraordinary sell-off in risk assets globally,” Skew CEO and co-founder Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk.      Bitcoin (BTC) was trading above $9,000 on Friday and looked set for stronger gains over the weekend. However, the cryptocurrency fell sharply from $9,900 to $9,000 on Sunday, possibly due to liquidations by alleged PlusToken scammers and declined further to a two-month low of $7,640 on Monday.      The rapid price drop was accompanied by a sell-off in the traditional markets and likely fueled demand for options.      “The sell-off has provided an ample amount of opportunities for both shorter-term traders and longer-term investors alike to acquire bitcoin and other assets at a significant discount to where prices stood just two weeks ago. Options are one effective way of taking advantage of these opportunities."" Justin Gillespie, CEO of Titus Investment Advisors and bitcoin trader told CoinDesk.      Volumes have been rising right from the start of the year. For example, Deribit has witnessed an average daily volume of nearly $100 million over the past four weeks compared to $50 million in the period from December through January.      ""There's been an explosion of interest from investors, intraday traders, and miners in BTC options on Deribit the past few months,"" Su Zhu, CEO of Three Arrows Capital, told CoinDesk.      Zhu added the recent record volume reflects the growing importance of options flow on Deribit in bitcoin price setting. Back in mid-January, Zhu tweeted predicting a surge in options trading volume.    Open interest rises    As bitcoin’s price dropped, the global open interest – the sum of all options contracts that have not expired, been exercised or physically delivered – rose to $841 million on Monday from Sunday’s $798 million, according to Skew Markets.      The open positions surged from $250 million to $950 million in the first six weeks of the year and has remained elevated ever since, a sign of increased institutional participation in the bitcoin market.      Looking ahead, bitcoin’s option market could continue to register strong volumes because of uncertainty is likely to stay high ahead of the May 2020 reward halving, the coronavirus pandemic and the prospects of an all-out oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/10/bitcoin-options-saw-record-volume-of-198m-amid-recent-price-drop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d06f57080d5fda1bfe12e1103b9af70748de586-2560x1708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404140,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSTC,1583848806,"Circle Rolls Out Stablecoin Business Accounts, Preps SeedInvest for Sale","Circle’s full-tilt pivot into stablecoins is nearly complete.      The payments startup intends to sell SeedInvest, the crowdfunding platform it bought a year ago, and focus its remaining assets on developing stablecoin products, said Jeremy Allaire, one of Circle’s co-founders and its remaining CEO (fellow co-founder and one-time co-CEO Sean Neville stepped down last year).      As part of this process, on Tuesday the company will roll out new APIs and Circle Business Accounts, which corporate clients can use to conduct business in USDC, a token on the Ethereum blockchain designed to hold its value against the U.S. dollar.      Circle has multiple revenue streams, Allaire told CoinDesk in an interview last month. But to maximize its research and development wings, its focus since last summer has been on new products centered around the USDC token, which Circle issues. Circle is also part of the CENTRE Consortium with Coinbase, which Allaire said created the standards around stablecoin issuance.      However, the story of Circle in recent months has been what it’s lost. In the past year, Circle has sold Poloniex, the crypto exchange it acquired in 2018; shuttered Circle Pay, its longstanding payments app; sold Circle Invest to brokerage firm Voyager; sold its Circle Trade over-the-counter desk to Kraken; and is now looking to sell SeedInvest (as The Block first reported).      SeedInvest no longer fits into what Allaire sees as Circle’s core business, he explained. The “strategic rationale for acquiring” the firm centered around Circle’s trading business.      “We were excited about this idea of tokenization and having tokens that were issued connected to all kinds of assets,” he said. “We exited the exchange business ... so the need for that set of licensing just doesn’t exist anymore. The second thing is this whole kind of tokenization, having regulated broker-dealers and tokenized securities, that’s been slow-rolled” by cautious regulators.      The company has seen its headcount similarly shrink, falling from a peak of 300 employees to roughly 125 as of January 2020, Allaire said.      Part of the reduction comes from employees moving with their various departments as they were sold.      “We had about 100 people who went with these different spinouts … [it was] a natural way for people to go with those businesses and product lines,” Allaire said.    Looking ahead    Moving forward, Allaire said Circle intends to announce new stablecoin products, reiterating a view of the payment startup’s future first shared via a blog post late last year. The first wave of products included the new business accounts, which Circle hopes to offer for free to new startups, but will offer subscriptions based on usage after.      “We’ve been executing like crazy on USDC,” he said. “We’ve tokenized over $1.6 billion in USDC, crossed the $500 million market cap recently.”      Attached is the transcript of our conversation, which covers Circle’s roadmap, Allaire’s approach to investments and his views on how the regulatory landscape will shift as stablecoin use goes mainstream. It has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.      CoinDesk: You said SeedInvest is getting spun off. Are you looking to secure a buyer or do you think it’s a company that can operate on its own?      Allaire: The way I look at it, there are a lot of strategicalternatives. [SeedInvest] is able to operate independently and can grow a lot. It's got fundamental economics and it exists in a competitive position within the market. I think with more capital behind it, it could grow significantly.      There are a couple of ways it can do this. It could find companies that want to add something strategic to their product portfolio. It could also find financial investors that are excited about the business and want to effectively take it over, inject capital in and scale it. Of course, we’re going to look at all those options.      Do you have a rough idea of its value right now?      Value is something that the market discovers.      I'm pretty sure you're on Twitter, and I’m pretty sure you're seeing all the commentary around Circle regarding its runway. Are you confident you'll be able to continue through 2020 or 2021 without having to make further layoffs?      I have a few things to say on that. I mean, the first is sort of obvious: We don't disclose our financials and things like that.      Second, by undertaking changes in our approach to new businesses and products that will be meaningful in terms of revenue and value, as well as axing businesses that we don't think are core, we’re radically improving the financial position of the company. I could say pretty definitely that we’re improving the financial position of the company.      Circle makes small fee revenue through USDC. Do you have other revenue streams right now, or is that part of the longer-term plan?      We have multiple revenue streams but, as you know, as a private company we don't break out exactly what those are. Some of those are revenue streams associated with prior lines of business, existing lines of business and new products we’ve publicly announced.      In early January, you published a blog post announcing a full pivot to USDC and stablecoins, and it sounds like you're going to be announcing new products around that soon. Could you give a rough overview of what those products look like right now?      So, just to be clear, we started working on new product development last summer and only first started publicly talking about that in January.      There are two key buckets, products targeted at businesses, which will provide products and services to businesses rather than midmarket individuals. Those really fall into two categories. One is accounts that businesses can open. We think of these as a new type of financial account that any business that wants to can use, store, custody, make payments with, and automate the use of stablecoins, can use those account services from us.      This is all stablecoin-native and accessible in 150 countries with integrations with the banking system. The really critical thing is what a business can do with these products. To that end, we’re introducing a new set of platform APIs. You can think of it as a platform-as-a-service or banking-as-a-service model for developers that want to build infrastructure to integrate stablecoins into payments, commerce, finance, or any programmable money use case.      I know Coinbase is also part of the CENTRE consortium. Can you speak to their involvement in all this, or is Circle operating independently of CENTRE?      So the CENTRE consortium is a standards and governance body for stablecoins. The first stablecoin from the CENTRE Consortium is USDC. We’ve publicly conveyed together with Coinbase through CENTRE that there's a roadmap to add additional currencies and blockchains to support those stablecoins. The consortium will set the standards and governance model for those, meaning it governs how reserves are managed and the compliance policies to be a vendor or issuer of a stablecoin.      It’s a bit like what VISA did originally. VISA was a nonprofit organization of member banks. Rather than having each bank set their own standards and issue their own plastic cards that could only be used by businesses and consumers that work with a specific bank, they created a set of interoperable standards so it didn’t matter [whom] you banked with. And it created a governance framework for compliance and liability.      We think these types of cooperatives will be really critical to the mainstream adoption of stablecoins. And that when regulators and policymakers set standards for stablecoin issuing, they will lean a lot on consortiums like this to be at the frontline of regulation and issuance. We imagine a world with tons and tons of different competing stablecoins, but a limited number of consortiums with standards and interoperability. CENTRE is the only live consortium model in the entire market. The Libra Association is a proposal to do something similar, but the Libra model has its own proprietary blockchain while CENTRE is designed to work with existing, public, open blockchains.      There is no relationship to these businesses that Circle is building. As a member [Circle] is able to issue and offer USD through their brokerage and exchange product. Circle can build whatever services it sees fit.      Again to bring up VISA: It’s a network consortium model made up of banks that all still compete with one another. There’s retail banks. There's commercial banks. There's merchant banks. There are all these financial institutions that plug into this standard infrastructure. In a similar way, in the world of stablecoins, you're going to have business-to-business focus, retail-focused products and services, and you’re going to have payments versus trading. There's a lot of different use cases. And that’s sort of the relationship of CENTRE to this.      Switching gears, it looks like regulators have been slow-rolling broker-dealer licenses. How has the regulatory outlook changed in the last couple of months?      Well, I would say one area that I'm seeing a really significant change is around stablecoins, specifically. I think policymakers and regulators are hyper-focused on this right now, because of what's happening organically in the market with things like USDC and because of the Libra network proposal.      There's a very high-level engagement in Congress, in central banks and among financial regulators. Just yesterday there were public comments from the chair of the G-20 finance ministers saying they are going to work on a specific set of regulatory policies on stablecoins as early as April, which could be finalized at the G-20 Summit in September.      If you want to have this be really the future payments of commerce and really believe this could be used broadly in mainstream business, you need the rules of the road to be laid down. It’s about making businesses and consumers feel safe to participate.      Would you say there has been a real shift in how domestic regulators are approaching U.S. dollar stablecoins?      Like I said just now, I think major national regulators in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions are trying to formulate what will ultimately become new guidance or specific policy recommendations. Some of which might need to be enacted by Congress, others that could become public guidelines. But I think that there's gonna be changes there.      Right now, there's a self-regulatory organization around stablecoins through the CENTRE consortium, making it the only stablecoin with a robust self-regulatory scheme around it. The only members of CENTRE that can issue USDC are all fully regulated in the United States as money transmission companies or trust-bank companies. We maintain the proper licenses. We go through examinations. We notify regulators of what we’re doing with these products. That includes state banking regulators throughout the United States, as well as the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN.      But, because stablecoins are likely to take on a bigger role in the financial system in the coming years, you're likely to see a policy shift from just the state level to a national focus.      I know you guys put out attestations about stablecoins reserves but don't on the banking relationship side. Have you had any issues, or have you seen any kind of change in how banks approach storing reserves for stablecoins?      I can't speak on behalf of other stablecoins but at CENTRE we’ve seen really robust demand from significant banking institutions to get involved in reserve banking stablecoin clients. That's not just here, but in international markets as well.      Will you continue investing in other companies in 2020?      That’s a good question. I’ve built two publicly traded companies, through a mixture of investment and M&A. Circle itself has done some M&A and we’ve obviously done some divestitures as well. When you build out a company you're constantly looking at what are you best suited to build? Are there things that you could invest in or acquire? We'll continue to look at that as we build out, but it's not like a specific strategy that we're gonna do this or that in 2021.      Going a little off the reservation here: When you set up a bank account for Circle’s new products, whose name actually appears on the account: Is it CENTRE, Circle or the entity holding the account?      The way it works is, CENTRE appoints reserve banks, issuers of USDC must be able to onboard with those reserve banks and each member issuer holds an account with those banks. The U.S. dollar reserves are rebalanced between the different issuers and accounts on a daily basis, but the accounts themselves are held by each consortium member.      I can't imagine the banks have seen that before.      There are lots of analogies in market structure in financial markets.",NEUTRAL,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDC,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/10/circle-rolls-out-stablecoin-business-accounts-preps-seedinvest-for-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/993041d761897afb0e484bed7e54d3749cf7ce32-2560x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404136,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSRE,1583845201,Previously Crypto-Only BlockFi Adds Cash On-Ramp Through Silvergate Partnership,"BlockFi, a financial company focused on cryptocurrencies, says it has enabled a new feature that will let customers use cash to buy bitcoin.      Previously, the Jersey City, N.J.-based crypto lender only allowed customers to bring digital assets onto its platform, such as stablecoins linked to the U.S. dollar, Chief Executive Zac Prince said in a phone interview. The system relied solely on “crypto payment rails,” he said.      Starting Tuesday, customers can send cash to BlockFi via wire transfers through a partnership with Silvergate Capital, a bank holding company based in La Jolla, Calif. The publicly traded Silvergate is one of the few commercial lenders willing to do business with cryptocurrency-focused companies.      The cash transfers can also be used to deposit money with BlockFi and earn interest, currently set at an 8.6 percent annual rate – some 860 times higher than the 0.01 percent rate offered on a JPMorgan Chase bank account. Unlike Chase, BlockFi isn’t a bank, however, so the accounts don’t come with federal deposit insurance protection. But also unlike Chase, BlockFi lets customers choose an option that lets them get the interest paid in bitcoin (BTC).      ""In an increasingly low-yield and volatile market, opportunities like earning 8.6 percent on stablecoin deposits with BlockFi stands out in the crypto sector,"" Prince said in a statement. ""Adding support for inbound wires will facilitate increased liquidity on BlockFi's platform, which flows through and improves liquidity in the broader crypto ecosystem.""    Meeting demand    More individual investors are becoming interested in cryptocurrencies, especially following the recent outperformance of bitcoin compared with U.S. stocks. Fears related to the economic impact of the spreading coronavirus have sent the S&P 500 Index of large U.S. stocks down 15 percent on a year-to-date basis. Bitcoin, by contrast, is up 13 percent in 2020.      Prince said BlockFi started developing the wire-transfer capability after being inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren't already cryptocurrency owners.”      For now, the new feature only allows for U.S. dollar wire transfers, according to a BlockFi spokesman. When the money comes in, it's immediately converted into Gemini's GUSD stablecoin and held in the user's account in that form.      BlockFi, founded in 2017, announced in February it had raised $30 million in fresh funding from investors including Valar Ventures, Morgan Creek Digital and Winklevoss Capital. The closely held company disclosed last month it had $650 million of assets on its platform, including cryptocurrency-backed loans, and that revenue surged 20-fold in 2019.      The company said in Tuesday’s statement it recently obtained a money-services business license from the state of Florida, allowing residents of the state to use BlockFi’s trading service and interest accounts.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/10/previously-crypto-only-blockfi-adds-cash-on-ramp-through-silvergate-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62456251a2ded787eb07573beb40201cf6a69876-2476x1670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Calling the project ""very exciting,"" Securitize CEO and co-founder Carlos Domingo said this was the beginning for both Securitize and LIFULL to ""modernize the Japanese real estate market together.""      Although Japan has some of the most densely populated cities in the world, this has come at the expense of the surrounding countryside, which has experienced significant population decline over the decades. It's estimated nearly 900 towns and villages across Japan will be deserted by 2040.      Securitize's platform is designed to open the rural property market up to the outside world, providing much-needed funding to revitalize and even repopulate settlements with low or aging populations. Because there are few restrictions on foreigners buying properties in Japan, the platform can operate with relative regulatory clarity.      Securitize said the crowdfunding platform, which leverages Ethereum-based digital securities, is faster, transparent and more regulatory compliant than comparable legacy systems. Being built on a public blockchain means investors can also review and monitor the flow of funds.

Open to wallet holders worldwide, loans are available immediately after collateral is made available, the firm said.      While it didn't specify which stablecoins the loans would be paid out in, Blockchain added the dollar-pegged PAX token to its wallet last year.      The new Borrow product comes after Blockchain opened an institutional lending desk in August 2019 – a service that climbed from $10 million in originations in its first month to $120 million by November, the firm said.      “Institutional and retail investors have the same financial goals – grow wealth and manage risks – but the tools at their disposal are vastly different,” said Peter Smith, co-founder and CEO of Blockchain. “Now, with our suite of trading products and Borrow, retail users can trade like the big guys without selling the crypto they’ve stockpiled or leaving their Wallet.”      Lending has become a fast-growing sector in the cryptocurrency industry, with Blockchain rivals like Binance having already launched similar services.

Oil prices are reporting a 7 percent gain and the U.S. 10-year note yield is trading at 0.70 percent, up nearly 35 basis points from Monday’s record low of 0.35 percent.      Gold, however, is down nearly 1 percent at $1,665 per ounce.      The recovery may be associated with hopes for fresh fiscal stimulus from U.S. authorities, as pointed out by popular analyst Holger Schaepitz. President Trump announced Monday that the White House and Congress will meet Tuesday to consider substantial economic relief measures, which may include a payroll tax cut.    Staying positive    Bitcoin may extend today's gains if equities continue to regain poise. Moreover, with the reward halving (a 50 percent supply cut) due in May, the macro view from some crypto fund managers remains optimistic.      ""I expect bitcoin and the broader crypto markets to rebound quickly against the broader equity markets on the back of continuing wider adoption and strong sentiment,"" Hong-Kong based investment fund Kenetic's co-founder and managing partner Jehan Chu told CoinDesk.      ""I think short term this macro market shock will make it difficult for funds and startups to raise money, but mid to long term it absolutely strengthens the use case of blockchain technology and crypto,"" Chu added.    Seller exhaustion?    The long-tail attached to Monday’s daily candle indicates bear fatigue. Further, the MACD histogram on the four-hour chart is printing higher lows below the zero line, a sign of weakening bearish momentum.      So a stronger recovery to $8,200 (Monday's high) cannot be ruled out. That said, bitcoin will remain bearish as long as prices stay below the head-and-shoulders neckline resistance, currently at $8,480.      On the downside, Monday's low of $7,625 is key support. If breached, that could cause more sellers to join the market and lead to a drop toward $7,000.      Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

42404164,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSY7,1583834400,Kraken Exchange Pledges India Expansion as Nation Reopens for Crypto Business,"Digital assets spot and derivatives exchange Kraken has made a pledge to rebuild services in India, after the country's Supreme Court overturned a two-year banking ban for cryptocurrency firms a week ago.      In a somewhat vague blog post Monday, the San Francisco-based exchange recommitted to the potentially massive market, which has seen its crypto industry suppressed by the central bank's order in April 2018 that prevented banks providing services to firms such as exchanges.      As such, India represents a huge earning opportunity for companies that can now speedily establish themselves in the near vacuum left by the ban. Several exchanges were forced to close due to the banking restrictions and others eked out a living on crypto-to-crypto trading or other means.      In its post, Kraken said it was ""thrilled"" to see the Reserve Bank of India's ban overturned, and would ""recommit resources to grow its service in the region through new features and offerings."" Among those was a hint it may target the massive remittance market in India, with Kraken keen to help Indians save and ""send value"" to friends and family overseas.      For more precise information on its plans, we'll have to wait till later in the year, Kraken wrote.      While the court ruling was exciting news for the crypto space, the regulatory situation in the nation is still not rosy, however. The central bank has reportedly said it would return to fight the supreme court ruling, though that may be a long shot. More worryingly, the country's government has been mulling cryptocurrency regulation for years, with some reports suggesting an outright ban.      Even if untrue, India's crypto and blockchain industry can't fully thrive and find the investment it needs until the situation has been made clear.      Local exchanges said this month there is a strong appetite for cryptocurrencies and derivatives in the nation. Before the court ruling, some international crypto companies including Binance and OKEx had already made moves to satisfy that hunger, announcing local services via acquisitions or partnerships.

42404146,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSc3,1583830800,Crypto Needs a Rational Value Investing Model,"Jeff Dorman, a CoinDesk columnist, is chief investment officer at Arca where he leads the investment committee and is responsible for portfolio sizing and risk management. He has more than 17 years of trading and asset management experience at firms including Merrill Lynch and Citadel Securities.    Investing in digital assets is a sham! Participants in this industry are simply trying to anticipate price movements rather than use fundamental analysis to determine why a token or coin might go higher or lower. There is no intrinsic value. It’s pure speculation based on technical analysis. It’s outright gambling.    It’s also exactly how stock and bond markets traded for the first 300 years.      In 1602, the Dutch East India Company issued the first paper shares. This exchangeable medium allowed shareholders to conveniently buy, sell and trade their stock with other shareholders and investors. For hundreds of years thereafter, investors and traders did their best to anticipate price moves, without any of the tools available today for valuing these securities. Back then, a stock trading at $100 was viewed more expensive than a stock trading at $10, independent of number of shares outstanding, underlying revenues, or business prospects.      It wasn’t until the 1920s, following the stock market crash and the Great Depression, that two Columbia University professors, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, came up with a methodology for identifying and buying securities priced well below their true value. Their book, “Security Analysis,” was published in 1934, and Graham and Dodd’s principles provided a rational basis for investment decisions that are still applied today by the world’s top value investors.      See also: Securities Law Helped Build Modern Capitalism. Crypto Should Embrace It      Warren Buffett chose to attend Columbia specifically to learn from Professor Graham (and received an A+ in his class). Almost 50 years later, Professor Frank Fabozzi introduced similar valuation techniques and concepts for investing in fixed income securities. And shortly thereafter, even newer valuation techniques (like Metcalfe’s Law) were introduced to help value computing networks, and these methods were utilized decades later to value pre-revenue internet giants like Facebook, Tencent and Netflix.      According to Gisli Eyland, who has written about the value investing philosophy, Graham and Dodd “described a fundamentally different approach to stock picking and investing in corporate securities by proposing that the investor should refrain from trying to anticipate price movements entirely. Instead, the investor should try to estimate the true Intrinsic Value of the underlying asset. Given time, the Intrinsic Value and market value would converge.” Today, investors and financial media throw around financial ratios like P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA, P/S, Dividend Yield and many others as if they’ve been around forever, while smugly chastising digital assets for having no intrinsic value. This may be a good time to remind readers that digital assets are less than 10 years old.    Fundamental models emerging in crypto    When will the Graham and Dodd of crypto emerge? They’re likely already here, working tirelessly behind the scenes on valuation techniques that will be utilized by the Warren Buffets of crypto 50 years from now. Digital assets are still in their infancy, but new fundamental valuation techniques are being built, tested and discovered every day, from the original MV = PQ analysis, to discounted sum of utility models, to everything else in between. Many of the models in existence are unproven, with only a few years’ worth of data to support their methodologies, while other models have likely yet to be conceived.      Each of these methods has advantages as well as shortcomings. Digital assets are unique, similar to corporate bonds, making different valuation techniques appropriate for specific token types. Just like a bond has different coupons, different maturities, different covenants and different features (callable, putable, convertible, warrants, etc.), most digital assets have unique features as well, making each analysis different than the last (there is a reason Fabozzi’s fixed income bible is over 1,800 pages long).      In our view, the DCF analysis is best used for tokens issued by cash-producing companies such as exchange tokens like Binance Coin (BNB) or Unus Sed Leo (LEO). The NVT Ratio may be better when comparing across smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, EOS and NEO. A variation of Metcalfe’s law or total addressable market analysis can be used for tokens that are in the early pre-launch stage or are servicing a sector that is difficult to currently measure.      See also: Never Mind Hodlers, Crypto Needs More Opportunist Investors      The smartest crypto analysts (including our own internal team at Arca) are developing new methodologies to value digital assets. Once these metrics become widely accepted, price floors and ceilings in crypto will be set based on agreed-upon, well-tested fundamental valuation – just like in the debt and equity markets.      I started my career on Wall Street in 2001. I was told to read Frank Fabozzi and Graham and Dodd before showing up for work on day one. I never questioned the legitimacy of these valuation techniques; I simply adopted them because everyone else did, too. Had I started in 1901, prior to ""Security Analysis,"" I likely would have been asked to learn how to read ticker tapes instead.      Equity markets turned out just fine, despite a rocky start in determining valuation that, in retrospect, seems silly. So did the fixed income markets. And so, too, will digital assets.
