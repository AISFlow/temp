42386651,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUSPP,1620255662,Revolut's UK Users Can Finally Withdraw Their Bitcoin to Personal Wallets,"U.K. digital banking service Revolut will allow its crypto customers to transfer bitcoin purchased on the platform elsewhere for the first time.      The neobank announced Wednesday the beta launch of bitcoin withdrawals to crypto wallets. For now, this will be limited to U.K. customers who subscribe to Revolut’s Metal service at a cost of £12.99 (about US$18) a month.      In the world of custodial crypto, firms like Robinhood, Revolut and PayPal have been scoffed at by enthusiasts for their restrictive stances on controlling one’s own digital assets. “Not your keys, not your crypto” has long been a rallying cry for hodlers burned by exchange hacks and other bugs.      Revolut, as Robinhood did earlier this year, seems to be taking baby steps toward allowing withdrawals of bitcoin bought on its platform.    Read more: Robinhood to Allow Deposits, Withdrawals for Cryptos Including Dogecoin    Revolut’s Metal customers in the U.K. number around 80,000, an estimated 40,000 of whom have invested in cryptocurrency, Ed Cooper, the fintech’s head of crypto, told CoinDesk.      Following the beta release, Revolut plans to extend the rollout to the rest of its U.K. customer base followed by those in other markets, including Europe and the U.S.      In beta, users will be limited to transferring crypto to just three different addresses, with caps on withdrawals of £1,000 (~$1,400) per month and £500 (~$700) a day.      “The main thing people want is to be able to withdraw their crypto to cold storage, which makes sense 100%,” Cooper said. “They also may want to withdraw to other exchanges that have got a larger array of tokens on offer, for example.”    ‘Flayed alive’    Subject to take up, the beta testing period, which will last a minimum of 45 days, will be followed by a phased rollout where the aforementioned limits are expanded and the service is extended to the other cryptocurrencies that Revolut supports.      Following bitcoin, Revolut will ""probably tackle"" ether, the other ERC-20 tokens and XRP, Cooper said.      There are currently 21 different tokens available on Revolut’s platform following the addition of 11 in April including cardano, uniswap and filecoin.      “The goal would be to eventually have withdrawals available for all of them but that will take some time,” Cooper told CoinDesk.    Read more: Revolut Adds 11 Cryptocurrencies to Its Trading Offerings    Revolut began offering crypto trading services in July 2017, but the lack of facility for customers to withdraw their holdings to other wallets attracted widespread criticism. Cooper admitted that Revolut was often “flayed alive” on social media by frustrated users for this.      “This is something we always wanted to do because it is more aligned with the crypto ethos,” he said.      “However, for us to get the licenses we needed and keep different partners happy, that wasn’t going to fly, so that’s why we went with the ‘walled garden’ approach you see today,” he said.

42386657,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUSYD,1620247840,"Market Wrap: Ethereum Classic Steals Show From Bitcoin, Ether, Even DOGE","In a reminder that easy money prevails, cryptocurrencies rallied on Wednesday with bitcoin (BTC) up about 5% over the last 24-hours. It was trading at $57,133 at the time of writing.      Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, bounced back from Tuesday's sell-off, pushing toward the all-time high of around $3,500.      News that Fidelity National has teamed up with NYDIG, a crypto custody firm, to allow U.S. banks to offer customers the ability to buy, sell and hold bitcoin contributed to bullish trading activity on Wednesday.      “Bitcoin could see continued momentum back above $60,000 just on the Fidelity news,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, a foreign exchange broker, wrote, describing the news as a “game-changer.”      Additionally, news that Galaxy Digital, a crypto-focused financial services firm, agreed to buy BitGo, the U.S. regulated crypto custody specialist, was another positive development for cryptocurrencies.      But the big story of the day was a 53% jump over the past 24 hours in price for ethereum classic (ETC), born of a contentious split a few years ago from the dominant Ethereum blockchain.    Bitcoin trading around $57,133 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $53,633-$57,356 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether trading around $3,476 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $3,237-$3,530 (CoinDesk 20)  Ethereum classic's rally might be a sign of cryptocurrency froth    Cryptocurrency markets are witnessing such a bull frenzy that some also-ran tokens like ethereum classic that were left behind during last year’s rallies in bitcoin and ether are getting a fresh look from speculative traders and surging to previously unthinkable levels.      The Ethereum Classic blockchain split from better-known Ethereum as part of a contentious “hard fork” in 2017. Last year, as enthusiasm mounted over the potential growth of decentralized finance, or DeFi, prices for ether, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, quadrupled. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, doubled, while Ethereum Classic’s token, ETC, gained just 26%.      Now, in 2021, cryptocurrency prices are surging across the board: The doggie-themed joke token dogecoin (DOGE) has increased a laughable-if-it-weren’t-true 117-fold. And ETC is joining the hunt, jumping 13-fold in digital-asset markets this year to a value of roughly $13 billion.      ETC hit a record high of $87 early Wednesday and was changing hands over $100 at press time, representing a 59% gain on a 24-hour basis, according to the data provider Messari.      That’s despite few major cryptocurrency investors or analysts regularly mentioning the network as one of several potential “Ethereum killers” – upstart blockchains like Cardano, Polkadot, Solana and Binance Smart Chain that might provide alternatives to Ethereum for DeFi applications.      “It appears to be dominated by ‘cheaper’ ethereum play and retail flow that has pushed DOGE to sky-high levels,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, told CoinDesk.      Read More: Also-Ran Ethereum Classic Catches Up Amid Crypto Market Frenzy, Hits Record    Bitcoin jumps along with traditional markets    Bitcoin was in full recovery mode Wednesday as traders brushed off concerns about rising U.S. interest rates, which had rattled cryptocurrency markets a day earlier.      The rebound came as U.S. stocks gained on strong economic data and after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen backtracked on her warning about the eventual end of loose monetary policy.      Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, often trades in sync with traditional markets because it's increasingly viewed by big institutional investors as a hedge against future inflation.      “Yellen had to clarify her comments and basically retracted everything,” Moya wrote in an email.      Some analysts described Yellen’s comments as a mere side note in financial media.      “Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is now in charge and he remains dovish, ready to support the economy,” wrote Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. “The party will continue for as long as the fundamentals stay the same.”    Price charts show bitcoin faces resistance at $58K    Bitcoin is approaching initial resistance at around $58,000, a level where traders have taken profits during the past few months. The cryptocurrency is recovering from the mid-April sell-off, although technical analysts remain cautious.      “Short-term overbought conditions have returned below resistance of $62,000-$65,000, which presents a near-term hurdle,” Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies wrote in an email.      “Any move below $50K in BTC will lead to sharp increase in market volatility and all crypto assets including BTC and ETH should move lower. Traders would keenly watch $60K level as a major resistance in case of any bull trap rally,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta, a crypto derivatives exchange, wrote in an email.    Less concerns about leverage in bitcoin futures    In the bitcoin futures market, traders continue to deleverage after the April 14 sell-off. In the past few days, the cost to fund long positions in the market for bitcoin perpetual swaps, a type of derivative in the cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets, declined to just above 0% – a level that typically precedes price recoveries.      “One of the key explanations behind the declining funding rates could be the ongoing altseason, attracting the risk seekers to move onto other coins in the spot market,” Arcane Research wrote in a report published Tuesday.      “With less leverage, fewer positions will risk becoming liquidated, setting the stage for less dramatic price movements.”    Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 declines    In traditional markets, equities recovered after Tuesday’s slump with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ending Wednesday in the green.      Over the past eight months, bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 has declined, which could point to the cryptocurrency’s diversification benefits. Bitcoin has largely decoupled from traditional equities since the March 2020 correction across risk assets. And since then, unprecedented stimulus has encouraged a reach for yield beyond traditional assets.    Ether cools off as bitcoin takes the lead    Ether is up about 2.6% in the past 24-hours, compared with a roughly 5% gain in BTC.      Ether broke a 10-day winning streak on Tuesday and has since stabilized, benefitting from the broader crypto recovery.      “Ether has been skyrocketing and today’s weakness is just modest profit-taking,” Oanda's Moya wrote.      The amount of ether held on exchanges has fallen to a 2.5-year low, suggesting few traders are queuing up to take profits and institutions are warming up to the crypto asset, according to Pete Humiston, manager of Kraken Intelligence.      Market participants have ""locked up more than 4 million ETH – 600K on Kraken’s on-chain staking service alone,” Humiston wrote. “The stars are aligning for another significant leg up for the ETH price.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green on Wednesday.

42386646,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUSHr,1620246215,"PayPal Q1 Transaction Revenue Rose 33% YOY as Total Revenue, EPS Topped Views","PayPal's (PYPL) Q1 transaction revenue rose 33% to $5.62 billion from $4.22 billion in the year-earlier period as the payments giant posted better-than-expected earnings and sales. The company boosted its year forecasts.      Quarter over quarter, transaction revenue fell slightly to the $5.68 billion reported in the holiday-spending boosted Q4.      Part of PayPal's transaction revenue was from the company's crypto buy, sell, and hold product. The payments giant also added 14.5 million in net new active accounts, down from 16 million added in the last quarter. (The company excludes crypto payments from total payment volume.)      Overall, the payments giant beat expectations with Q1 adjusted earnings of $1.22, well above the consensus estimate of $1.01. Overall revenue rose to $6.03 billion, north of expectations for $5.91 billion.  PayPal also raised year forecasts for net new accounts, total payment volume, revenue and earnings.      Q1 2021 is the second quarter PayPal has reported earnings including results from its crypto buying and selling product. The company has reported in the past that customers who purchased crypto through the platform have been logging into PayPal twice as often as they were before they could buy crypto.      Paypal CEO Dan Schulman in Wednesday's earnings call said that PayPal has had ""several positive conversations"" about cryptocurrency and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) with central banks, regulators, and government officials around the world.      ""This whole idea around establishing a digital currency and blockchain business unit inside PayPal, let's us think about what the financial system is going to start to move towards and how can we be a shaper of that, a leader within that, and not just a reactor to how that's happening,"" Schulman said.      The CEO also noted that PayPal's acquisition of Curv closed officially last month.      In April, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced its users could buy cryptocurrency using their PayPal accounts, although the fees on the PayPal feature in Coinbase are significantly higher than other ways of purchasing crypto from the exchange. Also in April, PayPal expanded crypto trading to its Venmo payments app.      This story is developing and will be updated.      UPDATE (May 5, 21:19 UTC): Updates with earnings, revenue.

42386650,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUSO9,1620238265,Don't Fear the Coming Regulation Wave,"There is a great deal of fear among blockchain companies and investors that increased regulatory compliance will be harmful to the industry. There is certainly the possibility that regulators, in their haste to increase transparency and compliance, impose impossible-to-achieve requirements on crypto companies. I’ve read more than one apocalyptic view forecasting the collapse of the blockchain business or the rise of China’s global economic dominance, should we somehow fail to meet this challenge.      This generates wonderful clickbait, but it is unrealistic. In fact, there’s a good chance that crypto ecosystems will dramatically transform regulatory compliance for the better.    This is a guest essay excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily crypto news roundup. Paul Brody is EY's Global Blockchain leader.    The internet already gives us some pretty good models for managing compliance in a massively complicated, highly decentralized and global environment. For 20 years we have debated on and off about how far to go, for example, with content verification and anti-piracy measures. None of the internet-destroying disaster scenarios came to pass, nor did the media and entertainment industry die under a blizzard of piracy. (Here, here or here or here).      The first component of a regulatory approach that may be borrowed from the internet is the idea of implementing compliance at the edge of the network. Companies that are the on- or off-ramps to the ecosystem are the best point to start with compliance rules around Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML). In the world of crypto that means banks and exchanges take the place of ISPs and content distributors. Their size and sophistication make them a good target for regulators, but they are also able to implement and digitize process at scale.      Decentralized models for verification of identity and qualifications can be similarly adapted from the public internet. Security certificates are used by nearly every website and all e-commerce systems. These certificates effectively represent a form of verified identity. They are managed in a decentralized model where they are not mandatory and there are multiple providers for these certificates. Of course, it is hard to do business without one, but in most countries companies have a choice of providers. There is no reason why this same infrastructure can’t be put to work issuing identity tokens or qualified investor tokens that can go in users’ blockchain wallets.      See also: Opinion – How the Incoming Administration Can Fix Crypto Regulation      Finally, we can write compliance rules into smart contracts. Indeed, this is already starting to happen. At EY, we have built the option to have allowed and blocked addresses and parties into the Nightfall privacy technology that we donated into the public domain. More sophisticated approaches are sure to follow, such as only allowing a trade to execute if both parties have validated identity tokens in their wallets from a set of authorized providers. This makes it possible to verify compliance without centralized control of individual transactions. The challenge here will be to balance compliance with simplicity, because as you add code and complexity you also increase the risk of exploits and errors.      The regulatory balance that exists on the internet cannot be described as elegant or simple, nor did it emerge smoothly. The internet today is far from the ideal, unified, global network that existed in the early 1990s. National regulations and firewalls, IP-based geofences and other tools have all chipped away at the feeling of limitless connectivity that existed in the early days. Despite those restrictions, in much of the world there is still no single, all-powerful gatekeeper that can block a company or idea from accessing the network. The internet remains, for the most part, a permissionless network.      This is most essential element of the internet that makes it an incubator of innovation, and it is the one that is most critical to preserve as we grow the regulatory maturity of the blockchain ecosystem. Many services that we take for granted every day have emerged on the internet in spite of fierce opposition from established industry players. From ridesharing to streaming audio to voice over IP telephony, not only are these businesses disruptive but, at least in some contexts, it could be argued that they are against the law or at least violate some rules users have agreed to upon signing up for internet service.    A flood of complex regulations or directions on implementation could dramatically slow the growth of the DeFi ecosystem.    Thanks to the permissionless and decentralized nature of the internet itself, there was no single regulator or entity that had the power to bestow or refuse permission to operate on these startups. Instead, cases against particular companies had to pursued through a variety of means. Often, those firms had time to get established and make their case. The result was gradual maturing of the regulatory ecosystem where the public’s interest in using these services was balanced against the interests of incumbents.      Very simply, the difference between a permissioned system and a permissionless one is the difference between killing a service when it’s just an idea and one that already has millions of users. It’s the difference between killing off ridesharing when it is a concept rather than when it has millions of users who prefer it to taking a taxi. The same will be true with decentralized finance (DeFi) and the blockchain financial ecosystem. Thanks to the permissionless nature of Ethereum the DeFi ship has already sailed. While it might be reined in by regulators, ending it altogether would be hard.      This does not mean that, once established, services are entirely free from regulatory scrutiny. It does mean any restrictions that come to exist are implemented in the context of a public discussion about the benefits compared to the costs. The regulators will be acutely aware of the millions of users they risk angering if they move with too heavy a hand.    Risks and rewards    I anticipate two major risks to the delicate balance that needs to exist for regulatory compliance to move forward without having significant negative consequences for the industry. The first is that very clever companies clash with regulators who are struggling to keep up with emerging technologies. What will happen the first time a company submits a mathematical proof as evidence of compliance?      If you must show that only authorized parties participated in a transaction, it is possible to generate a mathematical proof in verification without identifying either party. There are no regulators who are yet ready to receive and respond to such a submission, and, indeed, they might interpret such a submission as willful “too-clever-by-half” non-compliance with the spirit of the law, if not the letter.      The other big risk is regulatory capture. KYC and AML regulations are complex and expensive and widely known to be ineffective, yet they remain in place in part because financial services incumbents know that regulatory complexity is a major barrier to competition. A flood of complex regulations or directions on implementation could dramatically slow the growth of the DeFi ecosystem.      See also: Paul Brody – Web 3.0 Is Coming for the Sharing Economy      Against all those risks, there is one final countervailing force: It is difficult to kill a decentralized system. Just ask the Recording Industry Association of America. Streaming music services today are a veritable miracle compared to the world we lived in during the 1990s. My children will never know the horror of having to buy an entire album just to listen to one good song. They will never tape a single song from the radio. And none of this would ever have happened without BitTorrent, the fully and properly decentralized data network.      Napster, the original streaming service, was easy to kill because it wasn’t really decentralized. BitTorrent was decentralized and remains so. In fact, if you really want to steal some music you still can, and you can still do it with BitTorrent. Why don’t more people bother? Because given the opportunity to pay for a reasonably priced streaming service (with digital rights management so well executed it’s barely noticeable) that is enough for most people.      There is no reason to believe that we cannot, in the future, see the same for regulatory balance when it comes to DeFi as we have in the world of digital entertainment – leading to a huge range of services far better than the ones we use today. Like the internet, it will at times feel a little limiting compared to the truly open ecosystem we enjoy today, but, done well, it will be cheap, effective, automated and nearly invisible to most users.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/05/dont-fear-the-coming-regulation-wave,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8341d96ef3b260dd66782caa5853bbdf6ca0637e-2400x1602.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386655,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUSUR,1620238079,Uniswap v3 Is Live as DEX Aims to Become Ethereum's Indisputable No. 1,"Uniswap version 3.0 is live, an upgrade widely expected to make the automated market maker much more attractive for the cryptocurrency traders and funds with the deepest pockets.      The decentralized exchange, which appeared on Ethereum in late 2018, is currently the fourth-largest decentralized finance (DeFi) application on that blockchain, as ranked by DeFi Pulse, with $7 billion in assets staked. According to its own stats, Uniswap’s v2 accrued $1.6 billion in trade volume over the last 24 hours.      The company behind the Uniswap protocol announced version 3 was coming in late March and now the automated market maker (AMM) is rolling it out in the middle of a crypto bull run that has pushed ether (ETH) to all-time highs. ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the native token of Ethereum, where DeFi was born and much of the action still takes place.    What's new?    ""Uniswap v3 is a big step forward for the protocol,"" Peter Johnson of Jump Capital wrote via email. ""The increased flexibility it provides market makers on how they provide liquidity into the protocol makes liquidity provisioning more attractive, and should make trading on Uniswap more efficient for traders."" Jump Capital is the venture arm launched by the principals behind Jump Trading, the influential high-frequency and algorithmic trading firm founded in 1999.      The chief innovation in this new version is what the company is calling ""concentrated liquidity.""      Concentrated liquidity makes the basic functionality of an AMM more efficient for all users. A basic AMM allows market participants to deposit two tokens into any given liquidity pool. Each pool then offers a price for both tokens. That price is determined simply by the ratio of the two tokens.      When traders buy or sell tokens from AMM pools, they pay a very small fee for each trade. That fee is then shared out among all the pool’s depositors on a pro rata basis.      For example, if there's 100 DAI in a pool with 100 USDC, then 1 DAI is worth 1 USDC and vice versa. These markets depend on arbitrageurs to trade them back in line with the market when this simple system goes out of whack.      This approach leaves a lot of liquidity effectively unusable, though, because if someone tried to buy 70 USDC from our pool above, it would knock the average price for the trade way above the market price. So no one would ever make that large of a trade there.      Concentrated liquidity allows people lending funds to a pool, known as liquidity providers (LP), to define a band in which their deposits will trade. They might deposit 100 USDC and 100 DAI, but with the caveat their USDC will never trade for less than 0.99 DAI and never more than 1.01 DAI.      In that case, someone could buy 100 USDC and pay right around 1 DAI each.    Big bags    This enhancement is why most people in DeFi agree the new version of Uniswap will lure more “whale,” or large-scale, investors.      It's also a clever solution to the problem of ""impermanent loss,"" a persistent bugbear for liquidity providers to AMMs. In a classic AMM, a liquidity provider can lose money over shorter periods of time when one token in a pool of two gains too much against the other.      Bancor and THORChain provide insurance against impermanent loss. With Uniswap v3, however, a liquidity provider can simply not allow deposits to be traded in ranges where an impermanent loss would occur.      The new version also allows depositors to define different fees for trading, which should make it more attractive to provide liquidity to less-frequently traded tokens.      The Uniswap protocol is governed by the UNI governance token. UNI is trading at $42.88 as of this writing, up from $4.74 on Jan. 1.",POSITIVE,ETH | UNI | USDC,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | UNI | USDC,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/05/uniswap-v3-is-live-as-dex-aims-to-become-ethereums-indisputable-no-1,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2dcdbd7d6a50ceec4f5c8939f2f503567a4db0fe-2048x1371.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386659,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUSWx,1620236380,Crypto Derivatives Boom Leaves Small Traders Vulnerable to Liquidation: Carnegie Mellon,"Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University are warning that sharp price swings and liquidations could disproportionately impact smaller traders as the market for crypto derivatives booms.      A recent study by the Pittsburgh-based Carnegie Mellon University's CyLab found trading volume in cryptocurrency derivatives exceeds that of the underlying spot markets.      “Sophisticated actors are taking from amateur investors,"" Kyle Soska, a researcher at the lab who co-authored the report, said in an interview. ""Wealth centralization is taking place and there are a few big players.”      Liquidation events occur when traders cannot fulfill margin requirements for holding crypto derivative positions and often exacerbate price moves. In April, bitcoin futures had a record $10 billion worth of liquidations in one day after data showed leveraged traders were excessively skewed bullish. The liquidation coincided with a near 15% drop in BTC from an all-time high of around $65,000.      “When markets are trending up everybody makes money, but during a wipeout a few big actors take everything and the little guys are taken out,” Soska said.      Traders who take on smaller contract sizes are typically more long-biased, or betting on bullish price movements, according to the study. The short side of the trade typically consists of hedgers who own spot market bitcoin or cryptocurrency miners who want to manage revenue volatility by locking in prices for a specific delivery date in the future.      That means traders who have short positions in the derivatives market are more likely to be price-neutral in terms of their overall positions, making the BTC futures market more of a speculative net-long play, according to Soska.      “This is why there is a distinct asymmetry with long positions that are more leveraged with small position sizes,” Soska said.      The researchers analyzed trading activity on BitMEX, a derivatives exchange launched in 2014 that trades over $3 billion worth of volume per day on average. The exchange allows users to go long or short bitcoin with leverage of up to 100 times, often shorthanded as ""100x,"" according to the report.      “We focused on BitMEX because [it was] the only player back in 2014 and remained relevant for a long period of time,” said Soska.      In October, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged BitMEX with executing futures transactions on an unregistered board, as well as other counts, “in an attempt to evade U.S. regulations,” according to the CFTC legal filing.      When contacted by CoinDesk for comment, a spokesperson for 100x Group, the holding structure for BitMEX, pointed to a statement the exchange had provided to the researchers in advance of publication, in which exchange executives took issue with some parts of the draft.      ""The paper contains various inaccurate and/or misleading statements that do not properly reflect the platform's structure and operations,"" according to that November statement, which was included in the final report.      In an email, the spokesperson wrote that while ""higher leverage is available, we've historically seen the majority of traders opt to use lower leverage, with the notional weighted average leverage being under 10x.""      The CyLab report suggests that crypto derivatives, through excessive leverage and cascading liquidations, are supportive of rapid price jumps that have been commonplace in bitcoin.      “This raises concerns about the impact that derivatives have on BitMEX’s customers and on the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole,” the researchers wrote.      Crichton said the researchers were led to the topic, in part, because of the growing stature of cryptocurrency markets in global finance.      In 2019, Carnegie Mellon University announced a partnership with Ripple, a global payment network using blockchain technology, to fund academic research on cryptocurrencies. CyLab also published a companion website with real-time analytics of BitMEX data and said it encourages collaboration across the crypto research community.      “Crypto has gained a lot more attraction in the academic world in terms of being a more legitimized thing,” Soska said.

42386631,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUPHf,1620222889,"Also-Ran Ethereum Classic Catches Up Amid Crypto Market Frenzy, Hits Record","Cryptocurrency markets are witnessing such a bull frenzy that some also-ran tokens like ethereum classic (ETC), left behind during last year's rallies in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) , are getting a fresh look from speculative traders and mooning to previously unthinkable levels.      The Ethereum Classic blockchain split from better-known Ethereum as part of a contentious ""hard fork"" in 2017. Last year, as enthusiasm mounted over the potential growth of decentralized finance, or DeFi, prices for ether, Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, quadrupled. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency doubled. Ethereum Classic's token, ETC, gained just 26%.      Now, in 2021, cryptocurrency prices are surging across the board; the doggie-themed joke token dogecoin (DOGE) has increased a laughable-if-it-weren't-true 117-fold. And ETC is joining the hunt, jumping 15-fold in digital-asset markets this year to a value of nearly $12 billion.      ETC hit a record high around $150 on Wednesday and was changing hands near $105 at press time. Dogecoin also hit a new lifetime high of $0.69 early today. However, at press time, the joke cryptocurrency was up just 14%, while ETC was up 43%, as per CoinDesk 20 data.      That's despite few major cryptocurrency investors or analysts regularly mentioning the network as one of several potential ""Ethereum killers"" – upstart blockchains like Cardano, Polkadot, Solana and Binance Smart Chain that might provide alternatives to Ethereum for DeFi applications.      ""It appears to be dominated by 'cheaper' ethereum play and retail flow that has pushed DOGE to sky-high levels,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, told CoinDesk.      The ethereum classic token, now ranked 16th as per market value, has rallied by 128% in the first five days of May. Such a performance outruns even dogecoin, which has climbed 90% during the period and rose to a new record early Wednesday, at the meme-y price level of 69 cents.      Notably, ethereum classic may be getting an uplift from traders looking for an antidote against inflationary pressures as coronavirus-related restrictions lift – a theme that has drawn many big institutional investors to bitcoin.      According to Messari, pursuant to the Ethereum Classic blockchain's underlying coding, the ultimate supply of ETC will be capped at a maximum of 210.7 million tokens, and the pace of fresh supply gets reduced every time 5 million additional data blocks are added to the blockchain.      So the renewed interest in ETC could represent another side effect of the Federal Reserve's trillions of dollars of money printing since March 2020.      “You are seeing things in the capital markets that are a bit frothy, that’s a fact,” Powell said last week during a virtual press conference. “I won’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but also it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy.”      The wall of money from big institutional investors as well as retail traders looking for fast returns began flowing into crypto markets via bitcoin in October 2020. As a result, the top cryptocurrency has chalked up a sixfold rally in the past seven months, rising from $10,000 to record highs above $64,800. However, prices have steadied in the range of $50,000 to $60,000 over the past two weeks.      Also read: Dogecoin Price Finally Tops 69c, Flips XRP to Become Top-4 Crypto      Lately, the buzz has turned to ether, which is now regularly pushing to new all-time highs. Since then, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap has seen a steep rally from $2,100 to record prices above $3,500, with analysts attributing the bull run to Ethereum's solid organic growth.      And now all of a sudden, ethereum classic is becoming less of a punchline.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | ETC,BTC | DOGE | ETC | MARKET | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/05/also-ran-ethereum-classic-catches-up-amid-crypto-market-frenzy-hits-record,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2bfa7f849631a5f428bad05adcb9f7fd2cb7fdd-1300x793.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Only 12% of the sale’s 375,000 registrants were able to buy the 7.5% of outstanding MINA supply that Mina Foundation made available, according to data reviewed by CoinDesk. That’s more registered users than CoinList Head of Sales Mike Zajko said he’d seen for a single token sale at that point in CoinList’s three-year history.      The breakneck demand for O(1) Labs’ Mina protocol highlights how niche projects are leveraging their growing communities and the broader bull run into base-building token sales.      CEO Evan Shapiro said O(1) Labs was more interested in spreading MINA as far as he could than in nabbing more capital for the startup. His team ended up capping MINA buys at $500 instead of the original $1,000 target to give more buyers a chance, Zajko said.    Read more: Social Token Platform Rally Raises $22M in RLY Sale on CoinList    Zajko noted CoinList is broadly enjoying a rush of business from high-profile token sales in the past few months. These offerings build upon each other, he said. Protocol bulls arrive ready to buy their favorite blockchain’s token. Some invariably stick around, learn about other CoinList offerings and jump into those sales, too.      O(1) Labs raised early funding from investors such as Three Arrows Capital, Polychain and others in earlier rounds. This was the first time more casual followers of Shapiro’s zk-SNARKs-focused blockchain could participate. Ultimately, 40,500 walked away with a MINA stake.

But there was no “whale rail” for this community sale.      “In 2019, 2020, I think there were a lot of questions on the viability of token sales as a business, if token sales could be a thing,” Zajko said. “I think we've demonstrated that they are a very important part of the Web3 strategy.”      Correction (May 5, 22:06 UTC): Mina Foundation conducted the MINA token sale, not O(1) Labs.",POSITIVE,MINA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TRADING | MINA | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/05/lightweight-mina-blockchain-raises-187m-in-coinlist-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70df0627be097829d43cb8d3e7138d14ac1ecff1-880x440.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

By mid-afternoon the next day, ETH had exceeded $3,300. On Tuesday, May 3, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands around $3,500.    Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    Year to date, ETH price has nearly quintupled in a rally many analysts believe is fueled by speculation over the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      “It used to be the other way around, but now Bitcoin is riding the coattails of Ethereum,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the brokerage Oanda, to CoinDesk in an email.      The bullish price activity of ether over the month of April and into May is in sharp contrast to the poor price performance of bitcoin (BTC) seen over the same time period.      Since as early as April 2020, ETH’s correlation to BTC has been on the decline, moving from above 0.9 to below 0.7. This trend suggests more investors are beginning to recognize the unique value propositions of these two crypto assets and evaluate their investment cases differently.    Eth 2.0 validator rewards    As a result of ETH’s price rally, network rewards issued to both Ethereum miners and Ethereum 2.0 validators are becoming more lucrative than ever.      Since the launch of the Ethereum 2.0 network on Dec. 1, 2020, total daily validator rewards have increased from roughly $200,000 to $3 million. Miner revenues have also risen significantly over the same time period, trending at about $11 million in December to a high of over $82 million by April.      In a recent message posted to a public Ethereum Discord chatroom, Ethereum Foundation’s Tim Beiko warned that mining could soon become obsolete on Ethereum as a result of ongoing development and progress for the Rayonism project.    New frontiers: Steklo testnet    Plans to expedite Ethereum’s transition to a fully proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol took a big step forward this past week with Steklo.      On Friday, April 30, developers launched the first multi-client test network simulating the Ethereum blockchain run atop Ethereum 2.0 software.      The testnet, dubbed Steklo, faced several challenges as soon as it went live at 12:00 UTC. Some users were unable to process blocks. Others found themselves out of sync with the rest of the network which caused chain splits.      Steklo has since been deactivated by developers, who are now working on a second testnet to be launched as early as next week.      “[Steklo] is still just a 1-day interop[erability] test; we can spin up more later, after testing and sync improvements,” said Ethereum Foundation researcher Diederik Loerakker, better known as Protolambda, in a Discord chat room. “Good work everyone on this first [attempt] though; we made a lot of progress in testnet setup and client integration.”    Next steps for Eth 2.0    The larger goal will be to activate a working testnet between various Ethereum and Eth 2.0 software clients that not only activates PoS but also the technology of sharding. Sharding is a way of splitting up the processing load for transaction data across multiple networks. In Ethereum’s case, the plan is to create 64 sub-networks, also known as “shards.”      Functionality for sharding will be added to the third and fourth testnets that developers are working toward creating in the next few weeks as the Scaling Ethereum hackathon wraps up.      As detailed in a previous Valid Points issue, these efforts, focusing exclusively on Ethereum’s PoS merge and sharding implementation, kicked off in mid-April under the project name “Rayonism.”      By May 14, developers coding for the Rayonism project at the Scaling Ethereum hackathon expect to have launched two more testnets in addition to Steklo, each more feature-complete and durable.      In a presentation at Scaling Ethereum, Loerakker said work on Rayonism will continue even after the hackathon until developers are completely satisfied that code specifications for merging Ethereum and Eth 2.0 are secure.      “What we have [on] Ethereum is a huge amount, like basically one of the biggest decentralized exchanges, [and] all the dapps. There’s a whole super large ecosystem and we should protect it. So … after the hackathon as well – it’s not going to be a hackathon forever – we move towards production with iteration,” said Loerakker.      Ongoing progress on Rayonism has certain members of the Ethereum community expectant that the energy-intensive activity of mining could become obsolete and replaced with PoS validating as soon as December.

Resistance is seen around $56,000 and $58,000, where traders have taken profit over the past few months.    The relative strength index (RSI) on the hourly chart is not yet overbought, which suggests about 2%-3% upside to next resistance.  Bitcoin remains in a tight range as a pattern of lower highs on the RSI suggests slowing momentum and continued profit taking on rallies.

42386633,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUPKB,1620214048,Bitcoin Bounces Back to $55K as Yellen Backtracks on Rate Hike Comments,"Bitcoin (BTC) has regained poise on Wednesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen toned down comments suggesting interest rate hikes may be needed to stop the economy from overheating.      ""It's not something I'm predicting or recommending,"" Yellen clarified during an online event hosted by The Wall Street Journal late on Tuesday, downplaying remarks made earlier in the day.      ""If anyone appreciates the independence of the Federal Reserve, I think that person is me,"" added the former Fed chief, according to a Bloomberg report Wednesday.      Bitcoin found a floor near $53,000 after Yellen's clarification and was trading back above $55,400 at press time, representing a nearly 4% gain on the day.      Yellen had originally been discussing the scope for rate hikes in the context of U.S. President Joe Biden's plans for $4 trillion of infrastructure and welfare spending over the next decade.      ""It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy,"" Yellen said at an event organized by The Atlantic magazine.      Catching financial markets off-guard, the remarks intensified fears that an early unwinding of liquidity-boosting stimulus measures might push bitcoin, stocks and other assets lower. The Federal Reserve cut rates to a record low of 0.25% a year ago and has been buying bonds worth $120 billion every month to contain the coronavirus pandemic's impact on markets and the economy.      Bitcoin, often touted as digital gold, has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the Fed's massive inflation-boosting stimulus measures launched in March 2020. The cryptocurrency has charted a six-fold rally over the past 12 months.    Looking ahead    While the Fed recently reiterated its commitment to keep the liquidity tap open for a prolonged period, some experts fear the U.S. central bank would ditch its pro-easing bias and turn hawkish later this year.      ""We think the market is starting to price a hawkish change in stance into the June and all-important September meeting[s] later,"" QCP Capital said in a market update on its Telegram channel.      ""We expect Fed speakers this week will now set the stage for this shift in domestic stance and outlook, although the worsening [COVID-19] situation will likely buy them some time,"" the firm added.      The U.S. dollar is starting to show signs of life amid a growing debate over whether Biden's massive spending, coupled with a vaccine-led economic recovery, would force the Fed to scale back stimulus earlier than expected.      The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, rose to a 2.5-week high of 91.44 earlier today, extending its recovery from the two-month low of 90.42 reached on April 29, according to data and chart provider TradingView.      Also read: Bitcoin in Retreat; Taproot Apparently Not Winning Sufficient Miner Support      A continued rally in the U.S. dollar could yield deeper losses for bitcoin. The two assets have moved mainly in the opposite direction since March 2020, courtesy of the Fed's stimulus measures.      ""The USD is now a big risk to the crypto market, and the USD is beholden to the Fed,"" QCP Capital said. ""The crypto-sphere is inherently and perpetually massively short USD (against crypto assets), and any spike in USD funding or appreciation in USD value will affect it greatly.""      The dollar's recovery rally will likely pick up the pace if the U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, scheduled for release on Friday, blows past expectations, pointing to faster economic recovery.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/05/bitcoin-bounces-back-to-55k-as-yellen-backtracks-on-rate-hike-comments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d4d2c049f99f9b9f385d144ae262e4c6fc9e7c9-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Under the terms of the deal, BitGo shareholders will get 33.8 million of newly issued shares of Galaxy Digital common stock and about $265 million in cash, giving the deal a transaction value of about $1.2 billion based on Galaxy Digital's closing share price on May 4.  Last month, CoinDesk reported the two companies were in advanced talks about a possible deal.  ""The acquisition of BitGo establishes Galaxy Digital as a one-stop shop for institutions and significantly accelerates our mission to institutionalize digital asset ecosystems and blockchain technology,"" said Novogratz, Galaxy's CEO and founder.  The deal is another sign of M&A heating up in the digital asset industry following PayPal’s March agreement to buy custody specialist Curv. It also highlights the importance of custodians to this asset class. Crypto is more like cash or diamonds than a stock with an ownership certificate; once it’s gone, it’s gone.  More specific to Galaxy, it will help the company on its stated intention of becoming a prime broker. One can't be a prime broker without custody.  Canada-listed Galaxy also said it will ""undergo a domestication process"" on an intended path to a U.S. listing later this year.  Last year, BitGo was reported to have been in acquisition talks with fintech giant PayPal, which offered as much as $750 million in cash for the custody company.  Galaxy, which said it will gain about 400 global net new clients from BitGo, will use its balance sheet to fund the cash consideration, part of which will be deferred up to 12 months post-close, the company said.  BitGo shareholders will own about 10% of the combined company. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe will become Galaxy Digital deputy CEO and a member of the company's board.

The founder of a Reddit group responsible for rallying retail traders against large institutional hedge funds is planning to release a decentralized application (dapp) he says will help tackle ""market manipulation"" in traditional finance.      Jaime Rogozinski, the founder of the WallStreetBets (WSB) community has been working with blockchain and fintech experts to create exchange-traded portfolios (ETPs) to ""fight back against corrupt institutions and to end dependence on them altogether,"" according to a press release on Wednesday.      Portfolios will be governed under a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) community consensus within which the dapp's own $WSB token will allow holders to vote on various issues.      If token holders wish to change the weight and exposure of a particular stock, they may do so during voting cycles using $WSB tokens to influence a particular portfolio, according to the release.            WSB became a household name this year after attempting to stymie short-sellers on Wall Street by short squeezing them to ""near bankruptcy."" While the cryptocurrency and WSB communities may share some views when it comes to traditional finance, all discussion related to crypto is currently banned on the subreddit. A WSB moderator said the “negatives outweighed the positives” when it came to discussing crypto because as the subreddit primarily focuses on stocks.      Importantly, while Rogozinski founded the original WSB community, he was removed by Reddit administrators last year for attempting to monetize the community, an individual familiar with the company's decision said.
