Crypto Institutional Adoption The institutional adoption of digital assets is believed to be key to the future maturity and consolidation of the cryptocurrency market. The landscape of cryptocurrencies will likely keep on changing as a response to the ways worldwide regulations, macro environment, and mass adoption develops in the following years. Although many important corporations have started to gradually approach digital coins like bitcoin, there might be still a long way to go for institutional money to massively enter the market. Recently, Bloomberg reported a JPMorgan strategists&apos; note in which they claim that &apos;The biggest challenge for bitcoin going forward is its volatility and the boom and bust cycles that hinder further institutional adoption.&apos; Similarly, Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior financial analyst at FxPro, explained to Forbes that Bitcoin&apos;s price &apos;is determined not so much by volatility as by crowd interest.

42394302,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbQSt,1644622076,Which Web 3 Protocols Are Most Likely to Succeed? A VC Suggests a Common Thread,"The current Web 3 stack is an evolving canvas of composable protocols, each totally open source and susceptible to competitive projects forking their code. The ease of building a look-a-like project in the Web 3 space (a version of the internet that incorporates concepts including decentralization and token-based economics) can make it hard to decipher which protocols will become more valuable in the long term.  Yet, it is not strictly a protocol’s popularity that increases its long-term value but a combination of its popularity and defensibility. While popularity is easy to measure, defensibility is more complicated, presenting itself in various forms. After evaluating dozens of protocols, I believe the most desirable form of defensibility is usefulness that cannot be easily forked by a competitive project.  Parker McKee is a principal at Pillar VC, where he focuses on crypto and Web 3 investments.  I call this quality a project's “unforkable utility.” Unforkable utility reflects the hard-to-replicate value to a protocol user.  To recognize unforkable utility more easily, I identified its six most common forms and paired them with examples for context. Interestingly, all six types fall under the broader umbrella of network effects. I am still developing this framework. Here is my thinking in hopes others can critique or build upon the ideas.  The 6 types of unforkable utility:  Protocol collateral/liquidity (capital)  Protocol liquidity (content)  Critical mass of network participants (app layer)  Scaled value + critical mass of network participants (security)  Asset acceptance  Asset liquidity  Collateral/liquidity Capital  The first type of unforkable utility is collateral and liquidity in the form of capital. By capital, I mean assets on-chain that help make a market operate efficiently. For example, the lend/borrow protocol Aave’s front end and smart contract functionality can be forked easily, while the project's collateral and liquidity are much harder to replicate.  The borrowers’ collateral on the protocol forms one side of the marketplace. The liquidity from the supply side forms the other side of the market. Both collateral capital and liquidity capital are unforkable, and paired together they create unforkable utility to the user.  At the time of writing, Aave, the best-known lend-borrow protocol, had the most collateral/liquidity of all lending protocols, with $11 billion in total value locked (TVL). As a result, a user that takes out a loan will in theory be using the best, most efficient market for executing large transactions. The efficiency of scaled collateral/liquidity serves as the protocol's unforkable utility.  Read More: The Choppy Waters of Crypto Liquidity  Content liquidity  Similar to capital liquidity, a protocol can also see liquidity in the form of content. Similar to Aave, LBRY (Web 3 Youtube) is a two-sided marketplace, but instead of borrowers and lenders, LBRY connects content creators and viewers.  Unlike Aave, though, LBRY’s unforkable state is only found on one side of the marketplace with the content creators and their content. A mirror copy of the LBRY protocol and GUI could be created but the new project would need to convince the content creators to publish their content on the new protocol.  History shows that viewers favor platforms with the most content and as a result, the deep library of content acts as the unforkable utility. There is also a positive loop at play with more content leading to more creators, who produce even more content. Other examples of Web 3 content liquidity are Mirror and Audius.  Critical mass of network participants (app layer)  A famous computer engineer named Bob Metcalfe once surmised that the value of a networked device is proportional to the square of the number of its users. Hence, the more participants on a common network, the more valuable network access is to each user.  The best example of this in Web 3 is a hypothetical decentralized messaging protocol (someone please build this!!). As the number of participants on this protocol grows, so does the utility to each user. After a given network reaches a critical mass, even if an incrementally better protocol is created, the delta in utility between the network with all the participants and the protocol with no participants is so great it’s unlikely a migration will occur.  In the case of the messaging protocol, the unforkable utility is in the collective group of network participants. Another example of this would be a decentralized payments network.  Critical mass of network participants (consensus/security layer)  Another type of unforkable utility is the network security spurred by scaled network value and a critical mass of network consensus participants. Whether it is a proof-of-work (POW) layer 1 (base) chain like Bitcoin or a proof-of-stake chain (POS) like Algorand, the network becomes more secure as value increases due to the growing cost of executing a 51% attack. Moreover, the more consensus participating users there are on the network, the more complicated it becomes for any single user or group of users to execute such an attack.  As Kyle Samani, highlighted in his piece on L1 value capture, “The more secure [a layer 1] is, the easier it becomes for the next marginal user to justify storing their wealth in that chain.” The logical inference from this positive loop (more value leads to more users leading to more value) suggests there should only be a few layer 1 chains that are highly valuable and exceptionally secure.  Asset acceptance  Similar to the definition of “currency,” an asset can have unforkable utility if it’s “generally accepted at its face value as a method of payment.” In the crypto space there are numerous assets like USDC, USDT, etc. that meet this definition. Their project teams and communities have scaled their distribution and acceptance to the point where most people will accept the asset without questioning its value.  For example, if someone is given Solana USDC, it is more useful to the user if they can find an exchange that will take the asset or a merchant who will accept it. This challenge is even more acute for new project tokens. In the case of an asset, unforkable utility can be found in its acceptance by other parties, ecosystems and applications.  Asset liquidity  The more ecosystems and applications in which an asset is liquid, the more useful that asset becomes. Using the Wormhole Solana-Ethereum bridge as the example, when a user brings an Ethereum ERC-20 token to Solana using Wormhole, they are given Wormhole wrapped ether (wwWETH). This is a Solana native asset that represents ETH on Solana. This new asset, weWETH, is neat but a key factor in its utility is whether or not there is liquidity for it.  If there is little liquidity for the asset, a user is limited in how they can use it. When launching a new asset like weWETH, creating liquidity is critical in the early days, even if that involves partnerships and reward incentives. For an asset, unforkable utility is in its depth of liquidity and the number of locations where that deep liquidity can be found.  I hope the examples above prove that entirely open Web 3 protocols can achieve significant long-term value despite frequent forking attempts. Unforkable utility is hard to achieve, but has an enormous potential upside.  Still, soft forms of defensibility like community and brand that frequently have proven successful in generating value are also important to highlight. There are numerous Web 2 and Web 3 examples of this phenomenon. I believe that over the coming years we will see the very best projects use these soft forms of defensibility paired with the more mechanistic forms of defensibility above to create extremely valuable protocols.",NEUTRAL,ETH | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | USDC,Parker McKee,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/11/which-web-3-protocols-are-most-likely-to-succeed-a-vc-suggests-a-common-thread,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e4d8405c22da39b351540c58eb451703ee86092-2560x1645.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Netflix has already ordered a docu-series to be made about the story of Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan – also known by her rap moniker “Razzlekhan” – who have been accused of laundering bitcoin worth $4.5 billion dollars. American filmmaker Chris Smith (of ""Tiger King"" fame) has been tapped to direct the project.  A New York magistrate judge ordered Lichtenstein and Morgan released on bond Tuesday evening, but this was struck down hours later by a District Court judge who revoked bail, citing the couple’s means and motive to flee the United States. Documents filed yesterday added new evidence to the government’s flight risk case, suggesting the two had begun preparations for life in Russia or Ukraine.  Liechtenstein is a dual U.S.-Russian citizen, and renewed his Russian passport in 2019, say prosecutors. The two also traveled to Ukraine in 2019 for a month-long trip together. While the defense says it was just a vacation, prosecutors contend the two were preparing contingency plans for a life abroad.  While the couple was in Ukraine, say prosecutors, Lichtenstein allegedly created and updated various files in his online accounts that contained information about money laundering and “false identification documentation with Ukrainian connections.”  Prosecutors say Lichsteinstein had a folder called “personas” in one of his cloud accounts that contained several subfolders of both Russian and Ukrainian biographical information and identification documents for both men and women, which the government said was purchased on a darknet marketplace.  Prosecutors also note that Lichtenstein ordered several packages from darknet vendors to be delivered to a hotel near the one where the couple was staying in Kiev.

The letter addresses concerns from the crypto industry that last year’s Infrastructure Investment in Jobs Act would impose undue tax reporting burdens on entities such as crypto miners and stakers that don’t deal directly with customers by broadening the definition of a “broker.” The requirements require brokers to collect detailed information on customers and their trades.  Industry participants pointed out that miners, stakers and other parties don’t typically have access to customer information that exchanges have when they facilitate transactions. An overly broad definition might be impossible for some entities to comply with. Treasury’s letter, a copy of which was obtained by CoinDesk, suggests the expanded definition would be limited to parties that already collect this information.  “Existing regulations impose broker reporting obligations only on market participants engaged in business activities that provide them with access to information about sales of securities by taxpayers,” the letter said.  Bloomberg first reported the contents of the letter Friday.  According to the letter, which was written by Jonathan Davidson, an assistant Treasury secretary for legislative affairs, the department’s view is that “ancillary parties who cannot get access to information that is useful to the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) are not intended to be captured by the reporting requirements for brokers.”  Treasury also plans to analyze the “significant differences” between traditional securities supported by brokers and digital assets.  Davidson added that the Treasury Department plans to issue proposed regulations that reflect how it defines a broker, similar to the rulemaking process it follows for other regulations implemented by federal agencies.  That process will give the general public and industry participants a chance to comment.

Typically, traders overweight bitcoin during market downturns because of its lower risk profile relative to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).  During the 2018 crypto bear market, the BTC dominance ratio rose from a low of 35% to a high of 72%. And over the past year, the ratio declined by 30 percentage points as altcoins rallied ahead of bitcoin.  Some analysts expect bitcoin to remain under pressure for a few more months.

Philip Reichenthal, together with co-conspirator Randy Craig Levine and several associates, persuaded victims to send him millions of dollars, saying he would act as an escrow agent to purchase bitcoin for them. But neither Reichenthal nor his associates ever provided any bitcoin to the investors nor refunded their money.  Reichenthal was arrested on Sept. 14, 2020, for the crime. The 78-year-old Reichenthal, who was disbarred in October 2019 in a Florida court, faces a maximum term of 20 years in prison. Extradition proceedings against Levine, who’s been on the run from U.S. authorities since 2005, are pending.  According to the charges, Reichenthal and Levine engaged in two fraudulent schemes. In the first one, in 2018, Levine induced a man to wire over $3 million to Reichenthal from an over-the-counter crypto broker to fund the purchase of bitcoin, which was never made. In the second, in 2019, Levine persuaded a Florida man to send over $2 million to Reichenthal for buying bitcoin, which he also never purchased.  The prosecutor in the case, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, said “as a licensed attorney and escrow agent, Philip Reichenthal was entrusted to keep investors’ money safe. But as he admitted today, he betrayed that trust by siphoning millions of dollars of investor money.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS,Nelson Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/11/former-attorney-pleads-guilty-to-bitcoin-fraud-that-bilked-investors-out-of-5m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98d4a3f1c29cd42fc22e1fd7d2b05908fce10770-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394294,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbQDV,1644613176,CBDCs Are Going to Disappoint,"The world’s first central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) outside mainland China will start arriving in 2022. Indeed, a couple, like the Bahamas sand dollar and the Nigerian eNaira, have already arrived. And people should have appropriate expectations, because these early CBDC pilots are going to disappoint central bankers, blockchain enthusiasts and, most likely, end users as well.  While CBDCs are pitched as a kind of safer, government-backed alternative to fiat currency stablecoins, they are not going to arrive in any form that looks remotely familiar to existing stablecoin users. To start with, they are unlikely to arrive on a public blockchain. That means you won’t be able to exchange your eNaira for a CryptoPunk or park it in a deposit contract on-chain to earn interest.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist. This was a guest article excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Indeed, early CBDCs will not be programmable in any way. It will not be possible to use them in smart contracts as part of any decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Central bankers, wary of the big systemic technical risks that could come from a programming flaw in a national currency, are unlikely to enable Ethereum-style complex smart contracts.  Without programmability or access to a public blockchain, existing stablecoin users are unlikely to be won over or to see the value proposition at all. But CBDCs could still be attractive, if they manage to solve interoperability issues between countries’ financial systems.  Non-blockchain-using consumers are also likely to be disappointed in many cases. In designing CBDCs, central banks are struggling to balance the convenience of cash, pledges to respect end-user privacy and a strong desire to limit money laundering and criminal activity. Central banks are already discovering how difficult balancing these requirements is likely to be. Nigeria’s eNaira system, for example, requires you have an existing bank account in order to open an account.  Going through the existing banking system takes care of know-your-customer (KYC) rules enforced by global regulators.  Nigeria’s solution is fast and elegant, but has limitations. Specifically, transactions can be tracked (though that’s not necessarily the case), and because it requires an existing bank account, the currency does nothing to “bank the unbanked.”  Similar limitations will likely affect all CBDC prototypes and will have to be addressed to scale these systems or make them attractive alternatives to stablecoins or other quasi-banking apparatuses.  At the consumer level, CBDC experiments in 2022 will offer functionality comparable with familiar consumer payment services – only run directly by the central bank. However, as central banks are not historically known for their consumer services, this may not produce the most compelling user experience. That’s me being understated and diplomatic.  See also: Universal Stablecoins, the End of Cash and CBDCs | Opinion  A lack of polished user interfaces or sophisticated KYC tools (necessary in consumer banking) would not be an issue at the wholesale level. But wholesale CBDCs face numerous competitors. There are already real-time payment systems in the world, and so if a CBDC isn’t programmable, the functionality and value proposition is the same as established payment rails.  There is one final opportunity for CBDCs to make significant progress: tying together various national payment systems. While a very large number of countries have already deployed in-country real-time payments, there is no comparable cross-border system. The largest cross-border payment network is estimated to settle more than $400 billion in daily transfers between member banks.  So far, there is no one central bank that has a natural claim to facilitate transfers between countries. This market is up for grabs and could be completely transformed if CBDCs become widely deployed and interoperable. For that to happen, however, there has to be CBDCs deployed at scale in multiple countries.

In a tweet made minutes before the time of writing this article, the Bitcoin critic criticized mainstream media houses like CNBC for ignoring the 2% drop in Bitcoin&apos;s price in the face of a crisis, when gold was up by 2% to $1863, which is its highest price in the last three months. He also said that had the situation been reversed, CNBC would be constantly talking about it. Many Other Than Peter Schiff Predict a Fall in Bitcoin Prices Over the Weekend Incidentally, Peter Schiff is not the only one speculating a drop in Bitcoin&apos;s price. With the U.S. urging its citizens to leave Ukraine amid the threat of a war with Russia, many have been left wondering if this will lead to a fall in Bitcoin&apos;s price. Schiff, in one of his tweets made a few days ago, had said that gold was a potential alternative to Bitcoin and it was a safe investment.

Experts predict that if there is indeed a war between these two giants, it would take a massive toll on Bitcoin&apos;s prices.

42375286,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw79Xl,1644609454,The Digital Euro: What We Know So Far,"The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union (EU), is planning to propose a digital euro bill in 2023. The bill will complement the European Central Bank’s (ECB) experimentation into a retail central bank digital currency for the union.  The Commission’s plans to move forward with a bill is the most definitive sign so far that a digital euro could become a reality in the coming years. Since last year, the ECB has been giving mixed signals about the future of a digital euro. In September, just before the ECB’s two-year investigation into a digital euro kicked off, an ECB official said the project wouldn’t guarantee the launch of a digital currency. Later, ECB executive board member Fabio Panetta said a potential digital euro would ‘likely’ be legal tender.  With the rising popularity of private cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and stablecoins (which are pegged to the value of assets like the U.S. dollar), research into central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) has picked up around the world. A number of countries, including Canada and China, are running pilot programs, and Nigeria launched a CBDC in October. The U.S. and Europe, however, have moved at a relatively slow pace. In September 2020, ECB chief Christine Lagarde said that the EU has fallen behind in the digital payments race and that a digital euro could give it an edge.  Despite the urgency Lagarde expressed at that time, things are still moving at a cautious pace.  “The digital euro discussion is a very, very slow discussion because it's corporate, and the central bank plays a role. This makes it very complicated,” said Philipp Sandner, a German economist and head of the Frankfurt School Blockchain Center.  The Commission first published a report on a digital euro in October 2020, which was open to public comment until January 2021. A second public consultation is set to kick off next month, according to a report by Politico.  While EU think tanks like the Digital Euro Association (DEA) are advocating for a digital euro as a much-needed advancement in payments in the region, other researchers say a digital currency may not give the economic union the advantage it is seeking.  “Digital access to central bank money will hardly give the euro an edge in its competition with other currencies, be it the dollar or private global stablecoins,” Heike Mai, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Research, wrote in a report last year.  Little that we know  The ECB is investigating a digital euro and trying to come up with a functional design for one without being sure if it will ever issue such a currency, according to Mai.  “They just want to get prepared to have a concept in place and then decide whether they are going to issue it or not. If they were to decide two years from now that they will issue a digital euro, it will probably take another two or three years to go through an experimentation phase of implementation,” Mai said in an interview with CoinDesk.  She added that the EU won’t see a digital euro in action for at least five years from now.  “So far, we don't know what it's going to look like. And there's just not much information,” Mai said.  According to Jonas Gross, chairman of the DEA, banks will have a role to play in the design and issuance of a digital euro.  “The ECB released the report one year ago on their initial thoughts, and what we do know is that banks will be involved, so the central bank will not do all of it by itself,” Gross said.  The ECB is considering a retail digital euro that could be used by consumers for day-to-day transactions. Sandner expects that research will involve commercial banks. In November, the ECB tapped Evelien Witlox, a former director at Dutch bank ING, to lead the digital euro experiment. ING Group's primary businesses include commercial and retail banking.  What the public wants  The results of the Commission’s first public consultation on a digital euro showed that citizens in the EU consider privacy, security and the ability to use a digital euro in payments across the union’s 27 member nations to be priorities for a digital currency.  But the design of a digital euro that would address technology issues and privacy is still up in the air, Gross said.  It’s also unclear if the digital euro would be built on blockchain technology.  “The ECB has always pressed that they want the digital euro for payments. So as their main focus is to have a payment system, and to the question of whether it's going to be blockchain based or maybe based on more conventional technology, that's still open,” Mai said.  Sandner added that the ECB is working on a retail CBDC and is trying to do something with credit cards.  “You don't need a blockchain for this,” Sandner said, adding that for capital markets and industrial use, a blockchain system could ease settlement processes.  In terms of privacy, Gross and Sandner say it's actually possible to have a CBDC as private as cash, featuring anonymous payments.  “So, if the regulator and the central bank wants to have privacy the same as for cash, it's not the technology that limits it. It's rather a political and regulatory decision to be made,” Gross said.  The ECB declined a request to interview an official working on the digital euro project.  It’s also political  The ECB has been clear about its objective of maintaining its sovereignty in finance and payments, according to Mai. But when it comes to retail payment systems, there has been a lot of successful competition coming from non-European service providers like Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. The ECB, the EU and other political institutions don't like to see that, Mai added.  “They are not opposed to competition, just the opposite. They want competition in the payments market. And they have done a lot during the past years to get there. But they also want at least one retail payment system that works throughout Europe, in all European countries and is under European control,” Mai said. “So it's also a political goal.”  Gross says there is definitely a geopolitical dimension to digital currencies, as seen in the global response to China’s digital currency eCNY system that’s now being tested.  “This means that China has an advantage of probably four or five years as compared to advanced economies. And this could also lead to the situation that the Chinese currency is used more on a global scale. But this is today really hard to analyze, because we don't know yet,” Gross said.  Gross added that the ECB is following in the U.S.’ footsteps, referring to a statement made by the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on how it’s better to get a digital dollar right than to be first.  “This is also the perspective the ECB is currently taking when it comes to the euro because they don’t seem to be in a rush. They want to analyze this formally,” Gross said.  Financial implications  The ECB must also consider the implications of a digital currency on financial stability. The ECB’s 2020 report on a digital euro laid out fail-safes for protecting banks from runs, which occur when large numbers of customers move deposits out of banks. That could happen during times when banks impose negative interest rates.  The ECB plans to mitigate those risks by remunerating digital euro holdings at a variable interest rate over time or by limiting the quantity of digital euros that users can hold or use in transactions, the report said. For example, a non-interest bearing digital euro is more likely to induce large-scale withdrawals in a negative interest rate environment, according to the report.  “While banknotes already offer a non-interest-bearing alternative to deposits, storage and insurance costs mean that deposit rates can be below zero without triggering large-scale substitution into cash,” the report said, adding that holding digital euros would likely bear lower costs than holding banknotes, which could make the digital euros more attractive when interest rates are negative.  But there are also concerns about low use when it comes to a central bank digital currency. In addition to saying a digital euro might not have a competitive advantage over private payment systems, Mai wrote in her paper that the widespread use of the digital euro as a means of payment is also not very likely.  “Still, a high degree of data protection could make it more appealing than other payment options for users who put great emphasis on their privacy,” Mai wrote.  Sandner disagreed, noting that central bank digital currencies don’t have a counterparty risk, or a possibility that the other party in a transaction (in this case, the central bank) won’t keep its part of the deal, which makes it relatively attractive compared with some private currencies.  “Especially for the euro in the capital market, it would make very much sense to have a central bank acting,” Sandner added.  But all of this still depends on what the ECB will decide on in terms of type, design and execution of a digital currency.  “We're just at a point where the ECB is doing things to come up with a concept, and they don't talk too much about what they're doing right now, which is okay. They're working on their concept, and we don't have results yet. So in a way, we are waiting,” Mai said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/11/the-digital-euro-what-we-know-so-far,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/295b0569bcfd3e4c5ccd1e158acea2d834467901-799x533.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394289,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbPij,1644608512,Crypto’s Challenge: Right-to-Privacy vs. Right-to-Know,"It was striking how quickly Crypto Twitter’s obsessions this week went from ""How dare you dox that couple of Floridians"" to ""Woo-hoo, give me all the crazy dox you’ve got on that New York couple.""  Many in the community were incensed when BuzzFeed journalist Katie Notopoulos revealed the identities of the two founders of the iconic NFT project the Bored Ape Yacht Club, accusing her of “doxing” them against their wishes to remain anonymous.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  By contrast, after two people were arrested Tuesday on federal charges of conspiring to launder proceeds of the 2016 Bitfinex hack, there seemed to be an insatiable demand for details on the lives of a couple from whom the Department of Justice says it seized a gobsmacking $3.6 billion worth of ill-gotten bitcoin. Most of all, the crypto community delighted in the absurdist spectacle of rap videos by Heather Morgan, whose LinkedIn account describes her as a “serial entrepreneur,” a “SaaS Investor,” and a “Surrealist Artist/Rapper.”  Clearly, these cases are different.  With Wylie Aronow and Greg Salano, the identified founders of BAYC creator Yuga Labs, there’s no suggestion of criminality. We should accept at face value the notion that when they adopted the pseudonyms of, respectively, “Gordon Goner'' and “Gargamel,” they were simply exercising a civil right to privacy that deserves respect.  It’s quite different for Morgan and her husband, Ilya ""Dutch"" Lichtenstein. Assuming they’re guilty of the crimes they allegedly committed, a reasonable person can argue they forfeited that right. (We’ll come back to those words “assuming” and “allegedly.”)  Nonetheless, these two cases’ juxtaposition – coming on the heels of a revelation that a founder of DeFi protocol Wonderland (0xSifu) was in fact Michael Patryn, a co-founder of scandalous Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX – compels us to think about what we care about as individuals and as a society. It gives us a lens on where the lines lie between a shared need for information versus the mere desire for it, and thus how far the right to privacy extends.  These are trade-offs, and they are not nearly as easily determined as either side makes it out to be. Many in the crypto community who defend pseudonymity at all costs fail to acknowledge that there must be a line beyond which a public “right-to-know” exists. And, on the other side, journalists who frequently trumpet that right, tend to gloss over how much their story is driven by the need to titillate their readers (and please their bosses), or that doxing people has far-reaching consequences.  Right-to-know or clickbait?  My colleague, media reporter Will Gottsegen, whipped up the hornets’ nest this week when he came to the defense of BuzzFeed’s Notopoulos in a column with the headline “Of Course It’s OK to Out the BAYC Founders.” Will put it this way: “Aronow and Solano are at the helm of a business that’s potentially worth billions of dollars. Apes have flooded the market and saturated the culture. Why shouldn’t a journalist go looking for more details?”  There’s great responsibility that comes from leading something as transformative as the BAYC project. Whether the subject has done anything wrong may be irrelevant. If such individuals have a capacity to influence others’ well-being far greater than most people, shouldn’t we have a means of keeping them accountable in case they misbehave? Too often, the hacks and “rug pulls” that keep draining billions of dollars out of DeFi protocols are the work of insiders operating in the shadows.  The counterpoint is that to develop decentralized systems that empower users while disempowering Silicon Valley’s and Wall Street’s middlemen, we must make privacy a foundational principle. As proponents of crypto-engineered financial inclusion argue, identity requirements in incumbent centralized systems are a gatekeeping mechanism for enforcing control. To hold up that principle, surely we need to respect it for all, starting with those who build these systems.  It’s also hard to disentangle the public’s right-to-know from its appetite for a good yarn or from the business interests that feed off it. Notopoulos’ article argued, not unreasonably, that the BAYC founders should be held accountable for some of the unsavory aspects of their project – the claims, for example, that its images perpetuate a racist trope and that the artist who inspired the work has not been fairly compensated. Yet the BuzzFeed business model, like most digital media outlets, is based on ad models that rely on reader clicks (also true, to some extent, of CoinDesk). The reality is that “gotcha” articles that dox someone against their will are quite effective at achieving that.  It’s the same base instinct that drove people to scroll through social media gawking at the videos of Heather Morgan’s rapper alter ego “RazzleKhan.” We love this stuff: laughing at other people’s failure, delighting in them being caught out. Is that the right instinct on which to base a public’s right-to-know?  Privacy-forward media policies  At CoinDesk, we’ve taken a different posture on privacy than most other news organizations.  Mainstream outlets tend to insist that, in the absence of a credible threat of violence against them, sources should be identified on the grounds they can be held accountable to their words when their reputation is on the line. In a policy statement two years ago, our ethics and standards editor Marc Hochstein took a more nuanced and modern position that an individual’s choice to remain unidentified should be respected except in those cases where it is clearly in the public interest to know that identity. It was partly founded on the idea that, in crypto, pseudonymous identities also have a reputation that their owners are incentivized to uphold.  Note that the bar for exemptions to the policy is set differently in each case. Whereas traditional newsrooms put the onus on the source to demonstrate why their right to privacy trumps our right-to-know, we make it incumbent on the journalist to show that public interest outweighs the private interest.  Read more: Your Right to Anonymity Ends Where Risk to My Money Begins  This policy has manifested some interesting approaches. For some time we ran op-eds by a columnist who wrote under the pseudonym of Hasu. More recently, the team that’s programming Consensus in June contracted the NFT influencer known as Punk 6529 with a commitment that their avatar and audio can appear in a manner that protects that person’s identity.  Partly, our posture reflects an affinity with some of the core principles upon which cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies were founded, including the notion that privacy-protecting technology is not only vital to preserve our humanity in the digital age, but can empower people to forge a more dynamic, innovative economy.  As my own writings should demonstrate – here, here and here, for example – I personally believe the invasions of privacy executed by Web 2 platforms over the past two decades, with their insidious extraction of our data, comprise one of the biggest threats to the liberal democratic ideals for which hundreds of millions shed blood in the pre-internet 20th century.  And yet, as a journalist of three decades, I’m also acutely aware of another foundational element of that liberal democratic ideal: the right of a free press to uncover relevant, newsworthy information that people do not want revealed.  Coming up with defensible rules around this dilemma is really difficult. Still, perhaps more than ever, it’s vital that we establish and follow them.  Journalists, the crypto community, all of us: we need dialogue around how to balance the right to privacy and the public’s inalienable right-to-know.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ZRX,Michael J.

42375298,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw79kL,1644601745,Crypto Trading Volume Revs Up at Singapore's DBS Bank,"One year in, the digital asset exchange launched by Singapore’s DBS Bank saw the first indication of exponential growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 when trading volume hit more than double the rest of the year combined.  That said, DBS Digital Exchange’s full-year trading volume for 2021 was about $819 million (S$1.1 billion), a mere fraction of day-to-day volumes of platforms like Binance or institution-focused LMAX Digital.  DBS’ 600-member exchange (which includes a central bank) is now seeing things ramp up after switching on 24/7 trading in August 2021, according to Lionel Lim, CEO of DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx). In the fourth quarter of 2021, trading volume was about $595.5 million (S$800 million), more than double the preceding three quarters.  Rather like Switzerland, Singapore has been nimble and innovative when it comes to integrating crypto into the financial fabric of the country. But the regulatory clarity that accompanies all this involves a high bar in terms of compliance, hence the decidedly measured approach.  Why it matters  The first (and only) bank to launch a digital asset exchange back in December 2020, Lim emphasized this first year has been about testing the infrastructure needed to start moving an entire digital asset ecosystem, rather than clocking up trading volume.  A main component of this vision is the concept of tokenized financial assets, such as shares in private companies or fractional ownership of real estate, complemented by crypto-to-fiat on-ramps and digital asset custody within DBS Bank itself.  “What we have really done here is try to digitalize the process of capital markets, right from origination, to settlement, custody and trading,” Lim said in an interview. “We want to scale this in an exponential way, but we have remained cognizant of the regulatory landscape around crypto.”  Read more: Singapore Looks to Curb Crypto Ads  DDEx currently offers exchange services between four fiat currencies (Singapore dollars, U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Japanese yen) and four cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, BCH and XRP), with more coins and tokens to be added in 2022.  There will also be a measured expansion of tokenized issuances, following DDEx’s mid-2021 listing of its first security token offering in the form of a S$15 million digital bond. Now that a “well-oiled mechanism” is in place, there will be more security token offerings in the coming quarter and exploration of a broader client base, Lim said.  “We are toying with the idea of how we can serve a broader segment of customers down the road, to kind of move down to so-called middle-affluent people, potentially,” Lim said. “But of course we will approach this in a very measured manner.”  DBS Group Holdings Ltd. is scheduled to report full-year results on Monday.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/11/crypto-trading-volume-revs-up-at-singapores-dbs-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba5018473f0f4984eb7951d9a44068b98aa39171-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 2,164-square-foot house in Gulfport, Florida, fetched $653,000 (210 ETH) at auction, with the winning bidder being awarded a non-fungible token (NFT) as proof of the home’s ownership.  The logistics of the NFT itself are a bit complicated – the token is linked to the ownership of an LLC that owns the physical asset, not the housing deed itself – but represents continued experimentation in a sector that accounts for $16 billion, or roughly 1%, of the crypto market’s $2 trillion market capitalization.  Propy says the NFT can be used as collateral for crypto borrowers and investors. The sale comes at a time when the market for NFT lending services is beginning to find its stride.  “We’ve gotten hundreds and hundreds of requests from sellers to sell their homes all over the U.S.,” Propy CEO Natalia Karayaneva told CoinDesk in an interview. “The next big sale will be in Tampa again, it’s a condo that is worth between $200,000 to $300,000.”  Read more: Arcade Launches NFT Lending Platform as Blue Chips Hold Strong  Propy’s first-ever NFT-backed property sale came last May, when the company auctioned off TechCrunch CEO Michael Arrington’s Ukraine apartment.  While the Florida sale garnered some hype in the days leading up to it, the auction itself was anything but a bidding war. Despite over 7,000 people signing up to bid on the home, which only accepted bids in ETH, the property sold for just $3,000 over its initial asking price of $650,000.  Karayaneva told CoinDesk that Propy has three upcoming partnerships in place with lending protocols, one being with Helio.

In a Friday blog post, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intel's Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group Raja M. Koduri said Intel said will contribute to blockchain technology with a ""roadmap of energy-efficient accelerators."" Koduri said that the company is ""mindful"" that blockchains consume a lot of energy, which is why they are focusing on ""energy-efficient computing technologies at scale.""  Intel first revealed that it was working on a mining application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) dubbed ""Bonanza Mine"" in January, when a product release was included in the agenda for an upcoming semiconductor conference.  An Argo spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk that it had signed an agreement to buy Intel’s mining ASICs.  Griid Infrastructure has also entered into a supply agreement for Intel's new mining ASICs. As part of the agreement, Intel has guaranteed that it will sell at least 25% of its mining ASICs production to Griid until 2025.  The mining ASICs will offer ""1000x better performance per watt than mainstream GPUs for SHA-256 based mining,"" Koduri wrote. Large professional miners mostly use ASICs for bitcoin mining, however, so the graphics processing unit (GPU) comparison may not be as meaningful for them.  The chips are built on a ""tiny piece of silicon"" so that it won't impact Intel's supply of current products, Koduri noted.  Intel also announced a Custom Compute Group within its Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics unit, which will build custom silicon platforms for blockchain and other types of computing.  Block, led by Twitter's founder, is building an open-source bitcoin mining system, aiming to make the network more decentralized.

42421843,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSMP,1644595285,What Is a DEX? How Decentralized Crypto Exchanges Work,"Decentralized crypto exchanges (DEXs) are blockchain-based apps that coordinate large-scale trading of crypto assets between many users. They do that entirely through automated algorithms, instead of the conventional approach of acting as financial intermediary between buyers and sellers.  The algorithms that DEXs use are examples of smart contracts. They are pieces of code written on top of blockchain networks like Ethereum that trigger various outputs when given certain inputs.  The idea behind a DEX is ""disintermediation,"" which means removing middlemen to allow regular people to do business directly with each another. A DEX doesn't offer custody of users’ crypto assets. Instead, users directly hold all their assets in their own wallets at all times.  The largest crypto DEXs had begun to challenge some of the largest centralized exchanges (CEXs) in terms of trading volume by late 2021, according to a report by global accountancy KPMG. Just as exchanges are the largest crypto firms, DEXs are the largest decentralized organizations.  Typically, DEXs do away with conventional exchange order books – where buyers and sellers are matched based on order prices and volume – in favor of ""liquidity pools."" These are pots of crypto assets sitting under the surface of the exchange, waiting to clear any buy or sell orders that appear. The assets in the pool are sourced from investors, who deposit them in order to earn a yield from transaction fees charged to users of the pool.  The largest DEX is Uniswap, which was created on the Ethereum blockchain in 2018 by a former mechanical engineer who had learned to code only after getting laid off by Siemens the previous year. By late 2021, it was processing transactions worth more than $1 billion each day.  As of February 2022, Uniswap’s version 3 protocol was handling almost $2 billion in trading volume on some days, according to CoinGecko data. It typically manages around three times the volume of its closest DEX competitors, such as PancakeSwap, which usually see $300 million to $600 million in daily volume.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | UNI,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-dex-how-decentralized-crypto-exchanges-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21dee2088289aa04f39980cb2dc9e1eb4af12e9f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421849,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSTd,1644595264,What Is a CEX? Centralized Exchanges Explained,"Centralized exchanges (CEXs) are organizations that coordinate cryptocurrency trading on a large scale, using a similar business model to traditional asset exchanges like stock exchanges.  Exchanges are essentially marketplaces. They are useful when a large number of people may be simultaneously trying to buy and sell the same type of asset. In the traditional economy, famous exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange and the London Metal Exchange. In the crypto sector, some well-known CEXs include Binance, Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken.  Centralized crypto exchanges directly participate in markets by “clearing” trades. They typically keep digital order books, which are lists of open buy and sell orders, consisting of volumes and prices. They match up buyers and sellers and announce current market prices based on the last price an asset sells for.  CEXs generally offer supplementary services, such as crypto asset custody. They often require that users deposit their crypto assets at the exchange before trading can happen.  Exchanges are the most valuable businesses in the crypto world, according to a 2021 report by global accountancy KPMG.  As of February 2022, CEXs are still far more common than decentralized exchanges (DEXs). KPMG found that they accounted for around 95% of exchange crypto trading. The largest crypto exchange in the world is Binance, which is centralized although it has launched its own DEX. The centralized Binance exchange processes more than $20 billion in transactions each day, compared with less than $2 billion for the largest DEX Uniswap.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-cex-centralized-exchanges-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78e14db7429956b4e9c51a83e59b1f5146ae3dec-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.00003079 with a 24-hour trading volume of $1,805,384,970. According to some analysts, Shiba Inu is considered one of the best buys in cryptocurrency history. Of course, the crypto still has to prove itself. Phenomenal Performance: But Is Shibu Safe? Shiba Inu is by no means a reliable or safe investment; however, its 2,500% run in May 2021 revealed that it has the potential to surprise investors with spectacular gains. Shiba investments have risks, although, ShibaSwap&apos;s success and popularity might bring in large sums of money. With that said, with enough luck and liquidity, it has the potential to explode once again. On the other hand, putting cryptocurrencies into anonymous ventures such as ShibaSwap - which may allow the founders to cheat investors out of their cryptos - poses severe security risks. Scams costing DeFi&apos;s customers millions of dollars are on the rise. This possibility can be ruled out if software auditors have access to the code. ShibaSwap, on the other hand, has not yet been vetted by the community.

Former V Global CEO Lee Byung-gul was sent to prison for 22 years and ordered to pay a 106.4 billion-won fine by a court in Suwon, in the country's south, CoinDesk Korea reported. Authorities seized 10 billion won from Lee's account at the exchange, according to the report. Another six executives were handed prison sentences of four to 14 years and fines ranging from 2.3 billion won to 106.4 billion won, the report said.  S.

V Global also gave investors a 1.2 million-won commission for referring new users, according to Forkast.  The court said the exchange had defrauded over 50,000 investors, some of whom lost their retirement funds.

42375312,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7CA3,1644588000,CoinFund’s President Working on Assembling ‘Regulatory Legos’ for His Firms to Succeed,"Blockchain-focused venture capital firm CoinFund, which has invested in the likes of non-fungible token (NFT) gaming giant Dapper Labs and NFT marketplace Rarible, has spent the past year building its team to help portfolio companies navigate the complex regulatory landscape in the U.S.  Last month, CoinFund tapped former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo as a strategic advisor on Web 3 regulation. Giancarlo, affectionately called “Crypto Dad” by many in the industry for his pro-crypto stance, has plenty of experience operating at the intersection of regulation and technology.  Giancarlo was welcomed aboard by CoinFund Managing Partner and President Christopher Perkins, who joined the firm last summer from Citigroup, where he co-led the futures, clearing and foreign-exchange brokerage businesses.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Perkins said he joined the company with a “sell-side perspective of building regulated businesses.” His role involves helping portfolio companies navigate the regulatory environment and working with regulators and policymakers on “thoughtful policy design.”  “We want to give our entrepreneurs and founders sufficient safe harbor to innovate, to grow, to test, to take risks. And we want to do that in a safe fashion,” said Perkins, who added that he helps companies figure out “what regulatory Legos need to come together” to operate or partner in the United States.  Institutional hesitation  Crypto’s complicated regulatory environment is an often-cited reason why institutions are slow to leap into the industry.  “Adoption is slow but it’s coming,” Perkins said. The problem isn’t a lack of interest, according to Perkins, but rather the operational complexities of entering the crypto space. To assess a move into crypto, institutions often form task forces, which take time to do research and make their recommendations.  On the regulation front, Perkins said that from a macro perspective, the U.S. leads global crypto policy. He has seen increasing bipartisan support for blockchain technology with notable proponents including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Miami Mayor Francis Suarez.  “You’re seeing this very unique circumstance where the left and the right are starting to align. So we have an eye on the midterm elections, especially,” said Perkins, expecting to see more politicians supporting blockchain technology.  “Pretty much everyone I speak to is very favorable of regulation,” said Perkins. “We want a principles-based regulation that’s predicated on things like investor protections.""  ""We want to make sure there’s not fraud, manipulation and abuse,"" he added, noting he believes the CFTC is well positioned to police these areas.  Future plans  CoinFund closed its $83 million Ventures fund in early 2021, marking the Brooklyn, New York-based firm’s largest pool to date. Institutional investors (pensions, endowments and family offices) contributed more than half of the funding.  Perkins told CoinDesk the firm will continue to invest in its existing seed, venture and liquid strategies without specifying plans for future funds.  Investment focuses for the firm include gaming, infrastructure, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) and all the points where those verticals intersect, said Perkins.  Perkins sees NFTs as the gateway to user adoption of Web 3 as celebrities pour into the space, as well as with NFTs “starting to play a major part of popular culture.”  “There’s a degree of interconnectedness, where you’re starting to see games emerge where you can play with your NFT. You can financialize, trade and lend your NFT. And all of that requires infrastructure,” said Perkins. “At the end of the day, what is crypto? Crypto is nothing more than community.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/11/coinfunds-president-working-on-assembling-regulatory-legos-for-his-firms-to-succeed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec69bc6101ef204dea2d497f68cc8a46ed7c1ce9-1500x941.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This volcano worked well until May 2021. However, after setting its highs from mid-May on the weekly timeframe, you can see a gradual correction in the DOGE price. During this correction, trading volumes are low and there are no signals to complete this stage in the DOGE market yet. There is one small hint. As we can see, the DOGE price is moving in a clear corrective channel of the fall. Though, in recent weeks, market participants have begun to reduce the range of price movements. Thus, the DOGE price began to be traded in a narrow wedge. It is becoming increasingly difficult for sellers to update local lows. And buyers are not ready to start the active phase of growth and buy DOGE at market prices. https://www.tradingview.com/x/6oIv8WTi/ Therefore, in the near future we expect a shot of DOGE cryptocurrency up. The main condition for this scenario is to keep the mark of $0.1. In the implementation of this scenario, we will expect a price rebound to $0.26. However, this jump will not mean that the downward trend is over. It should be borne in mind that while the $0.26 mark under the control of sellers, the probability of a new fall wave remains high.

Major cryptocurrencies nevertheless remained lower Friday over 24 hours, with bitcoin down 2.8% and ether 4.5% at the time of publication.  U.S. inflation hit 7.5% in January, a 40-year high, with prices for goods and costs for services expected to pick up. Traders from Goldman Sachs forecast up to seven rate hikes this year. Rate increases are an attempt to rein in inflation, a direct result of the asset-buying program put in place by the U.S. Federal Reserve following the onset of the coronavirus in early 2020.  “Cryptocurrencies were under the pressure of strong data on inflation in the United States on Thursday, which has updated 40-year highs,” FxPro analysts told CoinDesk in an email. “Such values can force the Fed to raise interest rates faster, which is negative for all risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.”  Still, the Fear and Greed index – which calculates market sentiment – remained neutral even as crypto markets followed equities lower. “The stock markets are having an increased impact on the dynamics of Bitcoin and Ethereum, in which the prospects for monetary policy are being reassessed,” the FxPro analysts said.  Bitcoin regained the $43,500 level after a brief dip to as low as $42,900 in early Asian trading hours, data from tracking tool CoinGecko showed. The asset continues to face resistance at $45,500.  Meanwhile, crypto funds such as Singapore’s QCP Capital remain bullish on the crypto market for February. “Crypto prices rallied even though NASDAQ traded lower towards the end of last week,” the firm said in a Telegram broadcast. “We don't think this means that crypto has necessarily decoupled from NASDAQ but this tells us there is tangible and targeted crypto demand right now.”  QCP said it's bullish for February, saying that market expectations and reactions around Fed hikes should subside and pointing to “positive seasonality” – stocks typically gain in February.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/11/bitcoin-regains-435k-as-funds-predict-bullish-month-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c312efd90ae777ffa86f48dd0d0ed5b7a99eea66-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375323,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7CK7,1644577060,"SOL, XRP Lead Altcoin Tumble as US Inflation Jumps to 40-Year High","Major altcoins slid on Friday following a dip in the broader market. The total capitalization of the crypto market sank by 2.8% to $2.08 trillion. Altcoins led the decline, which led to an increase in the bitcoin dominance index by a half of a percentage point to 40.1%.  The dip came as broader markets reacted to U.S. inflation hitting a four-decade high of 7.5% in January. Goldman Sachs priced in up to seven rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year to battle against inflation, which is expected to lead to an increase in the costs of goods and services.  In the past 24 hours, payments token XRP and Polygon’s MATIC plunged 7.5% each after a rally earlier in the week, while Solana’s SOL and Polkadot’s DOT dropped nearly 6% each. Avalanche’s AVAX token was the best performer with a 0.4% decline, while bitcoin and ether lost nearly 3% and 5%, respectively.  XRP fell 10 cents following a charge to $0.91 earlier this week. The token saw resistance at the $0.90 level, as marked by CoinDesk earlier this week, to fall under $0.80 in early Asian trading hours on Friday. Prices reached favorable relative strength index (RSI) readings of 50 – a price-chart indicator calculating the magnitude of price changes – after Friday's drop, suggesting a brief recovery could be expected ahead. RSI levels above 70 mean assets could see a correction, while below 30 imply a recovery could be in place.  However, FxPro markets trader Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email that a drop for XRP below $0.78 would signal a deeper correction and open a quick path to $0.75. ""If all of February's gains are entirely nullified in the coming week and quotes pull back to below $0.60, it would be safe to speak of a new depressed period with a long-term downside potential of 50% to $0.3,"" he said.  SOL lost its $110 support level after breaking above it earlier this week. Prices could fall to the previous support of $100 should the decline continue.  Kuptsikevich added a downside for SOL could be on the cards: ""The rise from January 28th to February 7th looked like a technical rebound after being oversold since November. But this growth momentum is quickly fading. We can say for this coin that without positivity for the overall market, it will continue to lose ground faster than bitcoin and ether,"" he said.  Top meme coin SHIB dropped 4% following multiple rallies in the past week. Shiba Inu’s SHIB surged 40% on Monday and Tuesday following rumors of an unspecified activity with influential crypto exchange Coinbase. Its LEASH token then surged 43% on Wednesday following the announcement of ""Shiba Lands"" – a metaverse that would sell parcels of virtual land, purchasable with LEASH, in an upcoming game.  Theta Network's THETA token was one of the few altcoins above a $1 billion market capitalization to show gains. THETA surged 15% as co-founder Mitch Liu confirmed seed funding and a grant for upcoming blockchain tracking and video licensing platform Replay.  ""Launched by experienced technologists and entrepreneurs and utilizing Theta Video API (application programming interface), Theta peer-to-peer video infrastructure, and ThetaPass NFTs (non-fungible tokens) to offer content creators and end users a more fair share of revenues,"" Liu said.

And another confirmation of this axiom shows us the LTC weekly chart. As we can see, the powerful growth trend that buyers have been preserving and shaping since March 2020 has been broken. Sellers managed to break the bottom trend line without much effort. In addition, the LTC price was updated at least in July 2021. So buyers were able to start rebounding the LTC price. However, all this takes place at minimal volumes and can end abruptly at any moment. https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ri5GkmIA/ For the past 2 weeks, buyers have been trying to take control of the $155 local liquidity zone. So far, this attempt does not look very sure and the probability of continuing the consolidation in the range of $108-$155 is quite high. Although this scenario is positive for the LTC market.

The Sino Metaverse appears to be on track to follow in the footsteps of the web. When the internet initially became popular in the 1990s, many people predicted that technology would hasten China&apos;s democratic transition. The Communist nation&apos;s dislike for decentralization will not necessarily keep it from participating in the Metaverse, according to NewZoo&apos;s 2021 trend report Intro to the Metaverse, but the experience may be extremely different, comparable to how the internet looks different behind the Great Firewall. China controls its domestic internet and blocks foreign websites, filtering politically sensitive content. Similar Approach To Any Web3 Trends According to Mario Stefanidis, vice president of research at Roundhill Investments, China is likely to adopt a similar approach to Web3 trends as well. He said: &apos;It will be much easier for China to oversee the development of a local metaverse rather than allowing users to access the &apos;global metaverse&apos; and spending significant resources censoring and blocking certain experiences.&apos; The split will be particularly obvious between China&apos;s metaverse and the United States, according to Nina Xiang, writer, and creator of Asian digital intelligence and data company China Money Network.

The real number, however, is likely to be much higher as Chainalysis continues to identify ransomware-associated wallets. 2021 had the highest amount of active ransomware attacks than any other year on records. In fact, the average ransomware payments last year recorded $118,000, or 34% higher than the 2020 average while in 2019, the average ransomware payment was only $25,000. The number of active strains in 2021 also rose to 140 which is up from 119 in 2020, and just 79 in 2019. The growing number of ransomware groups can be attributed to the growing sophistication of third-party tools. For instance, in 2021, ransomware operators used proxy services, email attacks, stolen data such as passwords and IDs, and malware programs more than ever. In fact, these attackers spent upto 16% on tools and services to enable more effective attacks, up from 6% in 2020. The top three largest ransomware payments last year involved Conti, DarkSide and Phoenix Cryptolocker. In fact, Russia-based Conti used the ransomware-as-a-service model (RaaS) to extort over $180 million from their victims. On the other hand, DarkSide is notable for the infamous attack on the U.S. Colonial Pipeline that resulted in fuel shortages to some areas.

42375305,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7BxT,1644564415,DeFi Options Protocols Suffered as Ether Fell to $2.1K,"Options protocols built on Ethereum and other networks have seen falling volumes and users since the start of 2022, according to data analytics tool Glassnode. The trend follows a fall in the broader crypto market, analysts said.  An option is a contract that allows its holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on or before a specified date.  While options are predominantly used by banks and investment firms in traditional finance, several options protocols have sprouted in the past two years as decentralized finance (DeFi) – or products that use smart contracts for financial services – gained steam in the broader crypto market.  Options usage, however, seems to be correlated to market movements. The total value locked (TVL) in options protocols has experienced an exodus of hundreds of millions of dollars since the start of 2022, according to research from Delphi Digital this week.  TVL on platforms like Hegic dropped to under $800 million from $1 billion at the start of January, while some like Opyn saw nominal drops followed by a recovery.  Analysts said the drop came as crypto sentiment fell. “The drop is likely attributable to falling asset prices. Lower asset prices result in poor performance for put-selling vaults and a 'flight to safety' amid the market volatility, causing investors to withdraw capital from risky option vaults,” Delphi Digital said in a note this week.  Ether prices fell to under $2,200 at the start of January, losing 37% since November’s all-time highs of over $4,800. Tokens of other layer 1, or base, blockchains fell similarly, with Solana’s SOL losing 59% and Polkadot’s DOT losing 63% since November highs, CoinGecko data shows.  Risky for some and profitable for others  Developers behind some crypto platforms said options for crypto – which are themselves a risky asset class – form one of the riskiest strategies in the market, one that sees an immediate exodus if conditions turn bearish.  “The digital currency ecosystem is generally known as a very risky terrain based on the volatility of inherent assets,” Dmitry Mishunin, founder of crypto audit company HashEx, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Many pulled funds from perceived risky assets, and marketplaces of which DeFi options represents one.”  “If you agree to buy Ethereum when it goes -40% in a week and you are willing to sell Ethereum when it goes +40% in a week, you can use 'covered call' and 'writing put' vaults to generate an additional 40-50% yields on your holdings,” explained Andrey Belyakov, founder of derivatives platform Opium Protocol, in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.  Belyakov, however, cautions, “It is like a sharp knife, can be extremely helpful for cooking or one can lose a finger if he is not good with it.”  At the time of writing, the DeFi options market had a TVL of $761.1 million across a pool of 31 protocols. But some expect the TVL to return should market conditions improve.  “Confidence is expected to return to the ecosystem over the next few weeks, but all is dependent on how the broader digital currency ecosystem performs,” Mishunin said.",NEGATIVE,DOT | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | MARKET | SOL,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/11/defi-options-protocols-suffered-as-ether-fell-to-21k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3c0726714bc111e0a2cc7918937c27a250cdefe-1541x811.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Early next year, the legislative plan will include full EU-wide coverage of instant payments via Sepa Instant credit transfer, with the goal of addressing the fragmented market for cross-border real-time payments. It also aims to encourage open banking projects throughout the European Union. EU finance director Mairead McGuinness highlighted the Commission&apos;s legislative ambitions at a fintech conference on Wednesday morning, despite the lack of specifics. &apos;Our intention is to table legislation in early 2023,&apos; McGuinness stated during the unveiling. In the following weeks, there will be a targeted legislative consultation. The ECB is already testing the digital euro internally and hopes to have a prototype ready by the end of 2023.

Cardano Surpasses 30 Million Transactions As the adoption of the blockchain has grown, the transaction count has gone up significantly. The total transaction count for the network has now surpassed 30 million. For Cardano, this is an important milestone in the competition between the various smart contracts platform. This milestone comes on the back of IOG, the developer behind Cardano, announcing a new parameter update that helped to increase the block size by another 8KB bringing the total block size to 80KB. With this update, the number of transactions incorporated by the network on a daily basis has gone up greatly. The update was announced on February 1st. Since then, Cardano has incorporated over 895,000 transactions.

This includes Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which went below 27% from December. While Ethereum (ETH) has already seen positive returns in February, the potential of a price crash remains. The price of ETH might drop as low as $1,700, according to Bloomberg. Experts believe, however, that Ethereum&apos;s bullish fundamentals will be preserved. Ethereum May Follow Last Year&apos;s Price Trend Bloomberg has warned that it is pessimistic on Ethereum (ETH). Bloomberg experts anticipate that Ethereum might fall to as low as $1,700 in their latest Intelligence report. The drop, however, could be followed by an upward correction. According to Bloomberg, Ethereum (ETH) could follow in the footsteps of last year&apos;s June to September price movement, and fall below current levels to reach the aforementioned price. The report reads: &apos;Ethereum could repeat last summer and revisit about $1,700. Once the weaker leveraged long positions were purged, the resolution was a new high around $4,800 in November.

In an interview with CoinDesk, Zoe Hoang, Summoners Arena's chief marketing officer, said that the team is hoping to differentiate Summoners Arena from other entries in the genre by making it a game that people actually want to play, not just play-to-earn, calling her company's model ""play-own-earn.""  The team plans to use the proceeds to hire more staff and further develop the game by enhancing the graphics and adding support for virtual reality. It also plans to create a universe of other games with the same characters.  Hoang said that gaming is the “perfect use case” for NFTs (non-fungible tokens) because it can create a sense of ownership for gamers. When playing a game, gamers might ""invest"" dozens of hours of time, but before GameFi, there was no way for the gamers to claim ownership over their achievements.  Interest in gaming in Vietnam has accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic, with gamers primarily using their mobile phones or PCs. Consoles are pretty much nonexistent in the market because of their high cost and limited utility.  Using NFTs to represent ownership of achievements in the company's video games – and not just for speculation– is what caught the attention of Pantera Capital, Hoang said.  “By prioritizing building an amazing game first and layering in crypto-economics second, their play-own-earn model is setting a strong example for other projects in the space, learning lessons from early attempts at the play-to-earn model,"" Paul Veradittakit, a partner at Pantera Capital, said in a press release.  Although play-to-earn games are on shaky regulatory grounds in parts of Asia, Hoang said that the Vietnamese government hasn’t taken a position on crypto and existing laws haven’t caught up with the technology. Still, the government is meeting with stakeholders and has an open ear to their feedback on developing new laws.

42375306,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7Byj,1644541080,"Asset Manager Van Eck Says Stablecoins Should Be Treated as Investment Funds, Not Banks","Stablecoins should be treated like investment products, not banks, Jan van Eck, the CEO of investment firm VanEck, wrote in a Barron’s op-ed on Wednesday.  “They don’t lend money, so I don’t understand why there is a push to regulate them like banks. Bank regulation may in fact imply some sort of government guarantee,” he wrote.  Van Eck’s broadside followed two weeks after Nellie Liang, the Treasury Undersecretary for Domestic Finance, testified before Congress that stablecoins “are bank-like products … as well as an investment-like product, which is why there was a regulatory gap.” A group of regulators called the President’s Working Group for Financial Markets published a report last year recommending that stablecoins fall under the same regulations as banks.  In her testimony, Liang said that technology companies without bank licensing shouldn't offer stablecoins.  Van Eck criticized the Working Group report for not seeing the similarities between stablecoins and money-market funds.  “Despite the similarity that stablecoins have with money market funds, the PWG suggested that stablecoin issuers be “insured depository institutions.” Stablecoins invest in securities; they don’t lend like banks do,” van Eck wrote.  He made two recommendations for a potential, stablecoin regulatory framework.  First, he suggested that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission oversee stablecoins for a four-year trial period similar to how it considers investment funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Second, van Eck recommended not forcing tax withholdings on stablecoins in the future. That move would give stablecoins an opportunity to prove their value in the U.S. “Most stablecoins currently don’t pay dividends,” he wrote. “We need, however, to imagine a day when stablecoins pay interest and plan technologically and regulatorily for that day.”  Jerald David, president of asset management firm Arca, supports van Eck’s first proposal, saying that “stablecoins on the market today resemble more of a ‘40 Act product than a bank,”  ""Adding a wrapper and creating a Blockchain Transferred Fund would allow for a U.S. dollar proxy that would be welcomed by the banks and large scale financial institutions,” David wrote in an email to CoinDesk.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/11/asset-manager-van-eck-says-stablecoins-should-be-treated-as-investment-funds-not-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed442dd3e6f0386354a2bbfb6b164960ce56422f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42375317,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7CF5,1644540233,New Documents Detail Prosecutors’ Concerns That Bitfinex Hack Laundering Suspects Would Flee,"Hours after a New York magistrate judge ordered two individuals accused of laundering bitcoin from the 2016 Bitfinex hack released on bond following their arrest on Tuesday, a federal judge struck down the order, staying their release from custody.  New documents filed Thursday provide additional evidence against Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan and describe prosecutors’ concerns that the couple are “sophisticated defendants with the means to flee and ample incentive to do so.”  Lichtenstein and Morgan, a married couple living in New York, were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly laundering about 120,000 bitcoins – valued at $4.6 billion now – from the Bitfinex theft.  In late January, federal agents decrypted a file stored on one of Lichtenstein’s cloud accounts that contained the private key to a wallet containing 94,636 BTC (worth about $3.6 million), which was then seized by the Treasury Department. Outside of a series of small transfers in 2017 aimed at laundering a portion of the funds, the government says the “majority” of the stolen funds in Lichtenstein’s wallet were unmoved from August 2016 until the seizure in January.  According to the report, Lichtenstein kept a spreadsheet on his computer of fake personas and accounts the couple allegedly used to launder money through exchanges,  The defendants are believed to have about $330 million worth of bitcoin that hasn't been discovered yet, as well as “significant additional assets.”  Lichtenstein, a dual U.S.-Russian citizen, was found to have a document on his computer called “passport_ideas” that contained stolen biographical information purchased from a darknet marketplace, as well as links to darknet marketplace providers of false identity documents, prosecutors said. Prosecutors also noted during the arraignment that Morgan was learning Russian, which the couple’s lawyers dismissed as irrelevant.  However, the documents released Thursday say the couple “established financial accounts in Russia and Ukraine and appear to have been setting up a contingency plan for a life in Ukraine and/or Russia prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.”  According to the most recent documents, the government has also taken steps to combat the defense’s position at the Tuesday arraignment that Morgan was less involved in the scheme than her husband. Prosecutors allege that Morgan played an “integral role in the money laundering and fraud scheme.”  Prosecutors say Morgan frequently lied to banks and her own accountant when questioned about suspicious account activity, explaining away big transfers as a gift from Lichtenstein that she “had been keeping [in] cold storage,” or proceeds from her copywriting business, SalesFolk.  Morgan is accused of directly participating in the laundering by transferring money to SalesFolk-controlled accounts from a Hong Kong-based shell company that the government said the couple created to launder money.  Additional information about the searches of the couple’s Financial District apartment was also provided in Thursday’s documents.  Prosecutors say that at a Jan. 5 search of the couple’s phone, agents had to “wrest [Morgan’s] phone from her hands” after she attempted to lock it while pretending to get the couple’s cat, Clarissa, from under their bed.  Under the bed, agents found a “bin containing various bags holding multiple cellphones, SIM cards and assorted electronics,” including a plastic bag labeled “burner phones.”  In Lichtenstein’s office, agents found “two hollowed-out books, whose pages appeared to be roughly cut out by hand.” The cavities were empty.  Law enforcement also found over $40,000 in cash and a “substantial amount of foreign currency” (the origin was not noted in the documents).  One thing missing from the couple’s apartment were gold coins prosecutors say they previously purchased with bitcoin from a precious metals dealer. Though the government says the couple has at least “70 one-ounce gold coins,” not a single coin was found at the residence or a known storage unit.  Defense attorneys have filed a motion urging the court to reconsider its decision to keep the couple detained pending trial.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/11/new-documents-detail-prosecutors-concerns-that-bitfinex-hack-laundering-suspects-would-flee,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4359f6f7ea8543d0250cc6cc64ed6f99e1ecb7bd-6720x4480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
