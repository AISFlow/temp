These metrics show how much Bitcoin retail investors are buying and at what prices they are purchasing these tokens. Now, this metric had hit a previous all-time high in 2017/2018 right at the peak of the bull market at that point. Since the same thing is happening once more and retail investors are ramping up purchases, it remains to see whether this will correlate with another bull rally that sends the digital asset towards a new all-time high. Retail Investors Ramp Up In a chart that was posted to Twitter, market analyst Will Clemente showed that retail investors are currently purchasing the cryptocurrency at the second-highest rate in history. This is significant when looked at from the perspective of the last time retail buying surged past this point. However, it does not only spell good news even from a historical point of view.

42423586,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2bTdh,1649198013,First Mover Asia: Singapore Wants More Control Over Crypto Companies That Call It Home but Aren’t There; Major Cryptos Drop,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other major cryptos were off after hawkish remarks by Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard.  Insights: Singapore tightens restrictions on crypto companies that register there but do not have a physical presence in the city-state.  Technician's take: BTC buyers could remain active on pullbacks into the Asia trading day.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $45,890 -1.1%  Ether (ETH): $3,466 -1.5%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Dogecoin DOGE +11.9% Currency Filecoin FIL +2.3% Computing Litecoin LTC +0.3% Currency  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM −3.8% Smart Contract Platform Algorand ALGO −3.5% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum Classic ETC −2.2% Smart Contract Platform  Bitcoin, ether fall slightly  Bitcoin continued its recent restlessness on Tuesday, falling sharply after hawkish remarks by U.S. central bank Governor Lael Brainard, and amid the latest onrush of unsettling news from Ukraine. Other major cryptos were similarly in the red with DOGE and CELO the two significant outliers. The former rose over 17% at one point and the latter about 9%.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading just below $46,000, down from a high earlier in the day above $47,000 and off about 1% over the past 24 hours,. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at a little over $3,400, down roughly 1.5%.  Crypto prices dovetailed with major equity markets, which were largely off as investors considered additional interest rate hikes to curb inflation, which has soared to nearly 8% in the U.S. The tech-focused Nasdaq fell 2.2%, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.2%. In a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Brainard called the reduction of inflation of “paramount importance.""  “The committee will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting,” she said.  Meanwhile, Europe continued to wrestle with the moral and economic issues stemming from Russia's unprovoked invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Recent photos showing the slaughter of civilians in the town of Bucha near the Ukraine capital of Kyiv has brought mass condemnation. Spain, Denmark and Sweden, among others, expelled Russian diplomats while the U.S. and other countries that have condemned Russia are readying new economic sanctions.  U.S. President Joe Biden and the leaders of other countries have called for banning energy imports from Russia, a measure already undertaken by Lithuania. Germany, Europe's largest economy, has been a notable resister, saying that such measures would ignite a recession and cost the country jobs. ""An immediate embargo of Russian natural gas would be the wrong way to go,"" said Lars Klingbeil, co-leader of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democratic Party, said in an interview with a German news show.  Other crypto news has been more upbeat. MicroStrategy (MSTR) said on Tuesday that it had acquired an additional 4,100 bitcoins worth about $190 million. The news came less than two weeks after Terra's Luna foundation announced its commitment to purchase at least $3 billion in bitcoin.  Still, the events have not had a big impact on bitcoin, which itself may be a sign of the market's increasing maturity. ""The market is big enough that it doesn't really matter much,"" Cory Klippsten, the CEO of the bitcoin savings platform Swan Bitcointold CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Tuesday, adding: ""Bitcoin marches on. Tiktok, next block.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,525 -1.2%  DJIA: 34,641 -0.8%  Nasdaq: 14,204 -2.2%  Gold: $1,920 -0.5%  Insights  Singapore's effort to control crypto companies That Call the city state home but aren’t there  There’s a mini-boom in Taiwan of Web 3 companies. Over the past two years, dozens of high-profile projects have emerged from Taipei.  But where are these companies registered? Singapore.  Taiwan’s business registration process is a drawn-out process that requires a great deal of patience. If all goes to plan, the registration is complete in two to six months.  By contrast, the process takes 72 hours in Singapore and sometimes less than a day.  So it's understandable that many crypto companies – especially those based in Asia – choose Singapore. If your only asset is code and the team distributed, you can get picky about the jurisdiction in which you want to register. Why deal with Taiwan’s sclerotic bureaucracy when you can instead pick somewhere that operates with a sense of urgency?  But authorities in Singapore seem to be growing uncomfortable with the scale of this arrangement. Hundreds of crypto firms are registered there but have no material ties to the city-state, and are outside of the grasp of regulators.  The Singapore government is moving to change this. Earlier this week the Parliament passed a law that will require crypto businesses based in the city-state but only doing business overseas to be licensed, making them accountable to the authorities in the island these firms call home on paper.  In the reporting on the issue, there wasn’t much discussion of why this is occurring, nor was there mention of a particular event that spurred this decision.  As much as the crypto industry likes to talk about regulatory nomadism, there are reasons why this makes regulators uncomfortable. If a company has no physical ties to an area aside from the paper, there’s not really a way for regulators to compel a company to follow its directives. There are no offices to raid or assets to seize. Things like money laundering and terror financing come into the picture.  This is why Binance’s institutional investors want it to ""settle down"" and find somewhere to call home. Committing to a jurisdiction and placing assets and personnel there makes regulators breathe easier, compared with a company that is registered in one place and operates in another.  Still, Singapore’s move on licensure shouldn’t be seen as another chapter in its recent, less-friendly attitude toward crypto. Rather, it’s a simple ask for companies to commit to playing by the rules – rules that are still conducive to running a crypto business.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Range-Bound; Support at $43K-$45K  Bitcoin (BTC) is stabilizing after a 3% price drop during the New York trading day.  The cryptocurrency has failed to break above resistance at $47,000 over the past few days, which indicates a loss of upside momentum. Still, lower support around $43,000 and $45,000 could stabilize the pullback.  Momentum signals remain negative on the daily chart, similar to what occurred in early February. This time, however, bitcoin has broken above $43,000 with positive momentum on the weekly chart. That means buyers could remain active on pullbacks.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is declining from overbought levels, similar to what occurred in October of last year. Still, overbought signals can persist for a few months before a significant downturn in price.

In a somewhat unusual move, Riot also sold 200 bitcoin during March at an average price of $47,090 each, for a total of roughly $9.4 million. The company earlier this week filed a shelf offering for the sale of up to $500 million in stock via an ""at-the-market"" program.

By January of next year, the company expects to have a hashrate capacity of 12.9 EH/s, which assumes full deployment of about 120,150 Antminer ASICs.

BTC dipped by 3% following Brainard's statements, but stabilized later in the New York trading day.  Just launched! Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why.  A more aggressive approach to tightening central bank policy sent jitters through the market as investors reduced their exposure to speculative assets. Stocks declined while the 10-year Treasury yield spiked to its highest level since May 2019.  In crypto markets, dogecoin (DOGE) rallied as much as 17% over the past 24 hours following Twitter’s (TWTR) announcement of Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk joining its board of directors. Meanwhile, SHIB, another dog-themed meme coin, was up 4% on Tuesday compared with a 13% decline in WAVES and flat performance in BTC over the same period.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Balanced demand for bitcoin  The dispersion in crypto returns on Tuesday indicates some uncertainty among traders, which is particularly evident in the bitcoin futures market.  For example, the average bitcoin funding rate, or the cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures listed on major exchanges, has remained below positive for the 122nd consecutive day on Binance and Bybit, according to data compiled by Arcane Research.  ""However, since BTC broke out above $45,000 last week, funding rates have normalized around neutral territory, suggesting that there is balanced demand for long and short positions at the moment,"" Arcane wrote in a Tuesday report.  And for ether, FundStrat noticed that funding rates have been positive for 10 consecutive days. That suggests traders are more bullish on ETH than BTC, which typically occurs during an up market.  Further, blockchain data shows that short-term bitcoin holders have been accumulating positions since BTC's recent price low set on Jan. 22, according to Glassnode.  Still, the average volume of BTC supply held in long-term holder (whale) addresses has plateaued. ""This generally suggests that this wallet cohort are contributing the least to the current accumulation trends,"" Glassnode wrote in a blog post.  Altcoin roundup  Dogecoin rallies again after Elon Musk joins Twitter board: Dogecoin (DOGE) rallied on Musk joining the Twitter board.

The theoretical framework of a DAO is based on the decentralized nature of its operations. The construction of the organizations on a blockchain platform is evidence of decentralization in theory. The blockchain ensures that all user nodes have a direct claim of ownership of user data and digital identity over the network.

42394253,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvagnf,1649188074,Lawmakers Keep Mentioning Privacy in CBDC Discussions,"Hey folks. We’re still talking central bank digital currencies and digital dollars, so here’s some quick and vaguely unhinged thoughts on recent actions and statements on this front.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Digital (dollar) privacy  The narrative  Privacy in central bank digital currencies (CBDC) is a major concern for lawmakers and potential users. Allowing for, or even encouraging privacy is simple enough in theory but the technical practicality of enforcing privacy is another question altogether.  Why it matters  Privacy’s a big issue! And lawmakers think so, too. But there's various approaches to this and we’re starting to get a taste of these differences.  Breaking it down  U.S. senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) have introduced a bill to ""prohibit the Federal Reserve"" from issuing a digital dollar that could be sent straight to users.  The untitled bill, introduced by Cruz last Wednesday, would block the Federal Reserve from offering ""products or services directly to an individual,"" maintaining accounts for individuals or issuing CBDCs to people.  This caught my eye because I’m not sure the Fed has any intention of doing this.  Fed officials – and its recently published white paper on CBDCs – have long held that the U.S. central bank will not, and indeed perhaps can not, issue a CBDC without further authorization from Congress.  Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chair, said as much in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this year.  ""The Federal Reserve does not intend to proceed with issuance of a CBDC without clear support from the executive branch and from Congress, ideally in the form of a specific authorizing law,"" the white paper, published in January, said.  The White House has expressed interest in exploring a CBDC but stops well short of saying one must be created.  Still, efforts to have the U.S. issue a digital dollar continue. Last week, several lawmakers introduced a bill that would authorize the Treasury Department – not the Fed – to issue the CBDC.  The “Electronic Currency And Secure Hardware Act” proposes an electronic dollar that users could hold on smart cards or hardware wallets on their phones. The ecash bills would not be tracked on a decentralized ledger (or indeed, any ledger of any type), which its proponents argue will help preserve user privacy.  The press release issued by Cruz’s office cited concerns about privacy, saying, “Specifically, the legislation prohibits the Federal Reserve from developing a direct-to-consumer CBDC which could be used as a financial surveillance tool by the federal government, similar to what is currently happening in China.”  The ECASH Act would seem to address this concern by removing all possible opportunity for financial surveillance.  “It doesn't involve any account, which means that you can use it peer-to-peer directly. You can use it offline and because there's no third party, there's no loss of privacy expectation that comes with the third party doctrine,” Rohan Grey, who advised on the bill, told me.  Across the Atlantic, the European Union is emphasizing privacy in its own CBDC discussions. European officials have yet to determine whether they want to issue a CBDC (so similar to the U.S.) but are saying smaller or less risky transactions should allow for more privacy.  What remains to be seen is just how such a system can be created on a technological level. The ecash bills would have to be irreproducible by anyone who isn’t authorized to issue such bills (so as to prevent money laundering and forgery), despite being entirely contained within localized hardware.  In other words, it would have to address the double-spend problem without the digital ledger that Bitcoin uses.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam testified before the House Agriculture Committee last week. Many of the members’ questions centered around an FTX proposal to directly settle margined trades but there were also signs that lawmakers are considering Behnam’s request that Congress authorize his agency to have direct spot market oversight of crypto. Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) asked: ""If we define digital commodities and give the CFTC jurisdiction, should the CFTC have first crack at deciding what a digital commodity is?""  “Yes,” Behnam said.

The project appears to have issues well beyond that, however – its basic model appears to have facilitated the exploitation of impoverished workers by incentivizing a system wherein individuals with multiple “Axies” could loan them to newcomers, taking a cut, often a hefty one, of the play-to-earn game’s profits for themselves. This CNN piece after last week’s hack is also worth reading.  (Reuters) Russian nationals living abroad who actively oppose Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are finding themselves locked out of their bank accounts in what appears to be a case of bank-compliance-with-sanctions-gone-badly. While the sanctions as issued are meant to be enforced against prominent Russian oligarchs and the country’s leadership to puns it for invading its neighbor, other individuals are being caught up, apparently for just having a Russian passport. It’s a similar issue to what happened to Russian Visa and Mastercard users abroad.

42410897,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt3XV,1649187957,Ronin Attack Shows Cross-Chain Crypto Is a ‘Bridge’ Too Far,"Crypto news seeped back into mainstream headlines last week with the disclosure of a $624 million heist from Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network. The attack targeted the Ronin Bridge, which enables users to pass funds between the Ronin network and Ethereum.  To some in the crypto world, the Ronin attack was evidence that the future of crypto, even if it is to be “multichain,” is unlikely to be “cross-chain.” With teams fleeing Ethereum for more centralized blockchains that are faster and cheaper, the Ronin attack also served as a reminder of decentralization’s importance.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Ronin is a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum. Sky Mavis, the company behind the wildly popular play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, created Ronin in 2020 after realizing Ethereum’s base layer was too slow and expensive to handle all the transactions required to power such a game.  When you look under the hood, bridges like Ronin’s typically work by locking up cryptocurrency in smart contracts on one chain, and then re-issuing those tokens in “wrapped” form on a destination chain. So for example, if you were to use the Ronin Bridge to move ether (ETH) from Ethereum to Ronin, ETH would get locked up on Ethereum to serve as 1:1 backing for wrapped ether (WETH) issued on Ronin.  With so much money locked up in one place, bridges have become popular targets for thieves. The Ronin attacker pulled off March’s exploit by obtaining five of the nine validator keys that are responsible for securing the Ronin network. By holding a majority of the keys, the attacker was able to maliciously withdraw piles of cryptocurrency straight from the Ronin Bridge into a rogue Ethereum wallet.  Once the full extent of the Ronin attack became public, it quickly took its throne atop the infamous Rekt leaderboard, which started ranking attacks on DeFi protocols in 2020 in terms of money lost.  Ronin was not the first, nor is it likely to be the last, crypto bridge looted for vast sums of cryptocurrency. Joining Ronin in the second and third slots of Rekt’s leaderboard are two more attacks on crypto bridges. In third place is February’s $311 million exploit of the Wormhole bridge. And in second place is the August 2021 attack on the Poly Network bridge, where a hacker famously stole $611 million only to give it all back.  Read more: So You’ve Stolen $600M. Now What?  Stay in your chain  With yet another crypto bridge getting exploited for hundreds of millions of dollars, many in the crypto community have quipped that the Ronin exploit is further evidence that “cross-chain” crypto is doomed to fail.  Some members of the Ethereum community have pointed to the words of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who described his feelings on the limits of cross-chain bridges in a January Reddit post.  “The fundamental security limits of bridges are actually a key reason why, while I am optimistic about a multi-chain blockchain ecosystem … I am pessimistic about cross-chain applications,” Buterin wrote.  Sending assets across cross-chain bridges will never carry the same security guarantees as transacting within individual blockchain ecosystems, he explained in the 900-word post.  Much of Buterin’s critique of cross-chain bridges stems from the fact that they are particularly vulnerable to 51% attacks like the one that afflicted the Ronin network. If a bridge is attacked on one blockchain and drained of funds, users on the other end of the bridge – on a totally different blockchain – are also affected, since they will be left holding tokens that are no longer backed by anything.  “If there are 100 chains, then there will end up being dapps with many interdependencies between those chains, and 51% attacking even one chain would create a systemic contagion that threatens the economy of that entire ecosystem,” Buterin wrote.  Sky Mavis tried to scale up its ability to operate on Ethereum by building out a sidechain (Ronin). But scaling a layer 1 blockchain via a sidechain – which will always require a bridge – will arguably never be as safe as scaling via solutions like rollups, which inherit their security guarantees from a layer 1 chain.  Read more: Sky Mavis Pledges to Reimburse Players Following Axie Infinity Hack  The value of decentralization  In addition to highlighting the shortcomings of cross-chain bridges, the Ronin attack validated another core thesis among Ethereum devotees – one which is shared by bitcoiners and crypto-idealists in general – which is that true decentralization is vitally important to the success of any crypto ecosystem.  Decentralization often gets lumped in with the politics and ideology of crypto’s Twitterati – framed as a promise to pull power away from institutions and middlemen and give it back to the little guy.  While appealing to some, arguments around the philosophical virtues of decentralization are a turn-off to those who think blockchains are just as corruptible as any other technology. Moreover, more and more crypto projects are emerging that throw decentralization to the wind, believing (perhaps rightfully) that today’s users don’t care about decentralization so long as they can transact quickly and cheaply – a shortcoming of Ethereum as it currently exists.  The Ronin attack reminds us that decentralization, regardless of what users might think, is of practical security importance for big-money applications. Sky Mavis moved from Ethereum to Ronin to speed transactions and cut costs. It achieved these goals (Ronin processed over 500% more transactions than Ethereum at its peak), but its centralized proof-of-authority model, where just nine validators were in charge of securing the whole network, left it vulnerable to attack.  Ethereum has major scalability shortcomings, and its slow pace migrating to Ethereum 2.0 has left room for more centralized chains like Ronin to emerge out of sheer necessity. Nevertheless, as “the Merge” inches closer, last month’s Ronin attack showed why the hard work of decentralization at scale remains important.

Validated takes  Hedera Hashgraph enters the DeFi race by allocating $155 million for a “crypto economy fund.”  WHY IT MATTERS: Of the $155 million, $60 million will be dedicated for liquidity mining rewards for decentralized exchanges, and the other $95 million will be allocated for infrastructure-focused grants, according to HBAR Foundation Director Elaine Song’s interview with CoinDesk. These funds signal Hedera’s strategy to attract decentralized finance projects that are usable for the average retail user.  Several DeFi protocols were exploited for millions last week.  WHY IT MATTERS: Coming hot off the heels of Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network $624 million exploit, Ola Finance was exploited for $3.6 million in a re-entrancy attack, while Inverse Finance suffered a $15.6 million attack. The recent crypto exploits not only highlight how attackers are using advanced methods to execute their strategies, but they also remind us how thefts of large sums of money are commonplace in DeFi.  The U.K. government announced plans to make Britain a global crypto asset hub.  WHY IT MATTERS: Plans include recognizing stablecoins as a valid form of payment, commissioning the Royal Mint to create a non-fungible token this summer and exploring the transformative benefits of distributed ledger technology in U.K. financial markets. “This is part of our plan to ensure the U.K. financial services industry is always at the forefront of technology and innovation,” Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said.  Abra, a crypto brokerage platform, opened Abra Capital Management (ACM) to court high-net-worth clients who want a piece of the action in digital assets.  WHY IT MATTERS: ACM's intent is to give clients access to actively managed structured products and investment funds. Three of the five funds will target yield-generating opportunities in stablecoins, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). ACM is another signal of investor demand for exposure to this young asset class.

42423584,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2bTZh,1649187721,A State Senator Is Pushing to Attract Bitcoin Miners to Oklahoma,"Oklahoma State Sen. John Michael Montgomery is co-sponsoring a bill to attract cryptocurrency miners to his state.  The so-called Commercial Digital Asset Mining Act of 2022, introduced over a month ago by the Republican, looks to establish a framework of incentives to attract investment and create jobs in this burgeoning industry.  Although certainly not known as a center of tech or finance, there are already mining operations active in Oklahoma, Montgomery noted in an interview with CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Monday.  Some of these firms reportedly approached the senator, he said, in an effort to gauge how to expand and grow their business within the state. This is yet another example of how crypto – once thought to be a hotbed of anti-government political action – is cozying up to the state to seek incentives and protection.  The bill proposes a sales tax exemption for miners that would apply to their utility bills. If passed, Oklahoma would tax crypto mining operations “in a manner similar to historical forms of manufacturing or industrial processing,” two industries that formerly served as the bedrock of the state’s economy. Indeed, Montgomery’s bill is an explicit call to “encourage” a local crypto industry to saddle up in Oklahoma “rather than [in] competing states,” such as neighboring Texas.  “Electricity is already pretty affordable in the state,” Montgomery said on CoinDesk TV.  The state of Oklahoma is the second-largest producer of wind energy in the U.S., and its access to abundant natural gas are two key factors Montgomery pointed to for the state’s ability to support the energy-intensive operations.  Last month the state announced a partnership with Northern Data, a business-to-business (B2B) technology company with a foothold in the crypto sector, to establish its main computing hub in Pryor Creek.  That rollout in Pryor is expected to occur over the next two years and create nearly 150 jobs in the process, according to previous local reports. Northern Data also plans to purchase 250 megawatts of power from the Grand River Dam Authority.  There are stipulations for crypto companies looking to set up shop in Oklahoma. There is a requirement to make an initial property investment of at least $40 million within three years. Companies will also have to create a certain number of full-time jobs in order to claim that credit, though the state has yet to clarify the minimum necessary.  The Oklahoma Tax Commission must also guarantee those stipulations are met. Montgomery said inviting the crypto mining industry could increase tax revenue from utility usage for the state of 4 million, and that revenue would be used as a funding mechanism for public schools.  See also: Can Crypto Miners Make the World Greener?  As in neighboring Texas, Montgomery said there is an opportunity for miners and utility operators to work together on a “need-based basis.” In other words, because mining operations can power up or down based upon changing local energy needs, they can help balance the load, he said.  “We know how much energy [a potential miner] does consume,” he said. “It's something that helps out the grid ultimately,” he added later.  Further, the energy-intensive and largely profitable industry “empowers utilities to … expand their power offerings,” Montgomery said, fielding a question about a potential increase in power bills across the state.  About half of the state’s population lives on sovereign territory. According to the senator, as yet there are no bitcoin miner plans to build or expand on tribal land.

42394251,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvagiX,1649185888,A New SEC Definition for ‘Exchanges’ Has Big Implications for Crypto,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a proposal to, among other things, require “communication protocol systems” (or CPSs) to register with the agency and thereafter satisfy its many recordkeeping, transaction-monitoring and reporting obligations. These CPSs would be defined as systems or platforms that “make available” the means for buyers and sellers of securities to “interact.”  Concern has swept across crypto that this broad and novel regulatory approach would bring crypto, and decentralized finance (DeFi) in particular, into the SEC’s regulatory perimeter. In that world, we could see a steady drumbeat of enforcement actions that would dramatically redefine the risk profile of running a U.S.-based crypto project.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Many concerns  It is imperative that each and every participant in the U.S. crypto market let their voice be heard. The SEC is accepting comments on its proposal through April 18 and cannot finalize the rule until each and every concern is considered and addressed. And concerns abound.  There are, of course, two threshold issues. First, which tokens, if any, are actually securities? On that long-standing issue, this proposal is silent. Second, did the SEC even intend to rope crypto into this proposed regulatory regime? Nothing in the 654-page rule mentions crypto, DeFi or blockchain protocols generally, and so there is room for doubt.  The SEC could resolve all our concerns by simply and expressly disclaiming that crypto is implicated. One hopes it chooses that path.  Read more: Gensler Says SEC Exploring Shared Role With CFTC Over Crypto Platforms  Greater oversight  Under Chairman Gary Gensler's leadership, the agency has signaled its intention to take on greater oversight of crypto. The key question has been how. Legislative, rulemaking and even enforcement approaches have been options for pulling crypto within the agency’s purview. If this proposal signifies the SEC’s first effort at such rulemaking, it presents the industry many bones to pick.  Foremost among these concerns is whether this rule exceeds the SEC’s authority. The SEC regulates exchanges, which traditionally has meant platforms where buyers and sellers actually buy and sell, but not ancillary services or platforms. This rule expands that perimeter to platforms where buyers and sellers might merely talk about buying and selling. That’s a huge change, and arguably one that the SEC doesn’t have congressional permission to make.  Beyond that, the rule is simply impractical. It requires someone who “makes available” a CPS to register. What “makes available” means is a mystery.  The DeFi problem  That problem is compounded in DeFi, the crypto subsector that looks to reinvent financial services without middlemen. Decentralized lending, exchange and information platforms are sometimes built by loose, international collectives of coders and maintained by global online communities.  Are we really supposed to believe that software developers who contribute to open-source projects are to register with the SEC because the platform may facilitate buyers and sellers talking? How would a community register or who among its members would register? Who is held accountable for recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting when there is no centralized authority? This proposal highlights the inherent problems with imposing a central-authority-dependent regulatory scheme on disintermediated systems.  Moreover, rules must be issued according to a specific process, and the process in this instance is deficient in a number of respects.  First, the SEC needs to give adequate notice and opportunity to comment. Mere weeks to comment on a 654-page proposal that massively expands secondary market securities regulation and may also encompass crypto (without ever mentioning crypto) is anything but adequate.  Second, the SEC’s proposal must analyze the costs and benefits of the rule, including from an economic perspective. That analysis is missing, which is not hard to believe given the proposal’s breadth and ambiguity.  Such analysis would show the costs to the growing U.S. crypto ecosystem are plain. Homegrown DeFi projects would be incentivized to leave the U.S. (which would be the same result as if DeFi projects were explicitly banned). U.S. citizens would lose access to platforms that are proving to be more efficient, fair and accessible than traditional financial services, and the agency would create, perhaps inadvertently, a regulatory moat that shores up the primacy of big financial incumbents.  Read more: The SEC's New Proposal to Redefine 'Dealer' Could Spell Bad News for DeFi  What about the First Amendment?  If those shortcomings weren’t enough, this proposal is also at odds with the First Amendment. As written, the proposal would regulate speech based on its content, which is presumptively unconstitutional. The SEC arguably must have a compelling interest to regulate speech in such a way and must make the regulatory boundaries very bright lines. Neither appears to be the case. This is a fatal flaw. So too is the procedural failure to wrestle anywhere in the proposal with the implications for free speech.  The SEC has a very tough job regulating secondary markets in securities. The effort to address technological developments, to provide legal clarity and to bolster market competition by leveling the regulatory landscape should be applauded.  But when the effort falls short, the problems must be listed and addressed. U.S. law provides us with that opportunity, and between now and April 18, we must seize it by making our voices heard.

Despite the failures occasioned by geopolitical events globally, there is a desire to trade on crypto platforms amongst the masses. The phenomenon measured on the fear-greed index scale indicates that peoples&apos; feelings toward crypto trading lie on the greed side. Bitcoin has been among the big gainers in recent weeks showing that consumers understand its value. The following are predictable advantages of making BTC a legal tender across the world: Decentralization will Cushion Global Market against Geopolitical Conditions The current trend of BTC trading shows it is regaining stability, proving its ability to survive harsh geopolitical conditions. However, accepting crypto as a form of legal trading will shift the dynamics by ensuring global goodwill towards its success. The current fluctuations result from reluctance to trade in BTC due to the impacts of the international events on countries&apos; fiat currency valuations. Creating a decentralized global finance (DeFi) ecosystem will ensure that global trade is safe from unfavorable conditions.

Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Now Have A Value Of 96.2k BTC Per Month According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, a historically high amount of BTC has exited all exchange wallets recently. The relevant indicator here is the &apos;exchange net position change,&apos; which tells us the net amount of Bitcoin exiting or entering wallets of all exchanges. The metric&apos;s value is simply calculated by taking the difference between the outflows and the inflows. When the value of the indicator is positive, it means inflows are dominating the outflows right now, and a net amount of coins is moving into exchanges. Such a trend can be bearish for the price of the crypto as investors usually deposit their crypto to exchanges for selling purposes. On the other hand, positive values of the metric imply there is a net amount of Bitcoin exiting exchange wallets at the moment. This kind of trend, when sustained, may prove to be bullish for the price of the coin as it can be an indication that investors are accumulating right now.

Past Performance DASH is in a tight trade range as per the formation in the daily chart. The coin is in a bullish breakout formation, clearing $105 but capped at $140. It could tear higher or pull back in a retest depending on the breakout direction. DASH Technical Analysis As per the technical candlestick formation in the daily chart, the coin is in a bullish breakout formation above the descending wedge. The coin is bottoming up at spot rates, firm above the $120 support level flashing with February 2022. At spot rates, aggressive traders may load on dips above $120 and the positive inclining middle BB. However, since prices are consolidating, printing lower lows versus the upper BB, there could be precise entries above $140 or below the middle BB, depending on the breakout direction. A close above $140 may see DASH expand to Q1 2022 highs of around $155 in a bullish continuation pattern. What to Expect? DASH traders are buoyant at spot rates regardless of the consolidation.

The speech comes a day before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will release minutes of its March 15-16 meeting in which members decided to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) in order to bring down inflation – currently at 7.9%. This could provide further details of the central bank’s plan to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds.  While there is no proven correlation between the cryptocurrency market and inflation, recent market movements following the release of economic indicators suggest that at least some bitcoin traders react to traditional economic data.  Before the Fed announced that it would raise interest rates on March 16, bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $40,335. Following the announcement, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been on a steady increase, currently meandering around $45,900, according to data from Messari.  The Federal Reserve last reduced its balance sheet in 2018, after its assets quadrupled following the financial crisis in 2008. The minutes could reveal how high the Fed plans to set monthly caps for the amount of securities that mature in order to secure a smooth reduction.  Brainard, who currently awaits Senate confirmation to serve as the Fed’s vice chair, said that those caps would be much larger than during the reduction that followed the financial crisis.  “Given that the recovery has been considerably stronger and faster than in the previous cycle, I expect the balance sheet to shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous recovery, with significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017-19,” Brainard said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/05/feds-brainard-says-balance-sheet-reduction-to-happen-rapidly,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42394254,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvagxv,1649180091,Web 3 and the Rise of Small Media,"You. Yes, you. Are you an actual human?  It’s not an entirely unreasonable question to ask because the odds of a human reading these words is about one in three. You see, two-thirds of traffic on the internet is comprised of bots, according to analysis by security vendor Barracuda Networks.  What are these bots doing? Many are cruising the web indexing web pages, making it easier to find content. Others are doing “bad bot” things like trying to hack into sites. Yet more are clicking on ads.  Joon Ian Wong hosts a podcast called ""GMI Crypto Media"" analyzing the evolution of media businesses in crypto over the years.  It’s those ad-clicking bots that are a symptom of the problem plaguing media today. Click fraud is profitable because clicks generate payouts from ad networks. But as the volume of traffic surges, the value of each click falls. So the scale of traffic required to support actual journalism and publishing becomes ever larger.  The ad-fraud researcher Augustine Fou has a great chart titled “Not Humans, Something Else.” It plots the total number of internet users in the U.S. since 2004 against annual digital ad spending. Ad spend rockets upwards and to the right, far outpacing the number of internet users. To whom are advertisers showing all those ads? Probably bots.  What to do about all those bots reading your carefully crafted and edited articles? And, more importantly, how do publishers get paid if bots siphon away valuable human attention and depress ad rates? Blockchains solve this – well, at least partially.  Sybil-resistant media  For blockchains to work at all, they have to solve the same problem facing publishers trying to figure out whether their audience is human or robot: Sybil attacks. A Sybil attack is when a pseudonymous actor spins up multiple identities to overwhelm a network. The Bitcoin blockchain solves this by requiring nodes to pay a “tax on identity creation” without sacrificing pseudonymity, as the authors of the excellent Princeton textbook “Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies” put it. This is Bitcoin’s famous “proof of work” Sybil-resistance mechanism.  Similarly, we can imagine sprinkling some Web 3, blockchain-enabled magic on media models to create Sybil-resistant media. One of the simplest mechanisms for this is showing a reader content only if they hold some token, or a sum of tokens, in their crypto wallet.  This type of token-gated media model doesn’t presume the type of token: FWB, which is not just “SoHo House without the house,” but also publishes several streams of journalism, operates with a fungible FWB token. Meanwhile, a project like Unlock Protocol offers token-gating behind non-fungible tokens (NFT).  This is the “primary engagement media,” which the analyst Brian Morrissey has championed lately.  But because tokens are needed to reveal content means the tax on would-be Sybil attackers rises. What’s more, as the publisher gains popularity its token should rise in value, therefore levying a heavier tax on non-human readers. This aligns the interests of reader and publisher, cutting out the bot-enabled middlemen.  Current media trends  The notion of Sybil-resistant media isn’t just a blockchain pipedream. More traditional media businesses (TradMedia?) are also coming around to the idea that small is better. Instead of the venture-capital backed mass audiences of yore — think of venture darling BuzzFeed (BZFD) and how its stock price fell off a cliff once public markets could evaluate it. There’s now a case for smaller but more lucrative audiences.  Read more: Joon Ian Wong – The Future of NFTs Is Fungible  This is the “primary engagement media,” which the analyst Brian Morrissey has championed lately. Morrissey says publishers that adopt this model will go deep and narrow rather than wide and shallow. Crucially, this form of media will also be sufficiently influential to get readers to do stuff – whether that’s buying things from a publisher’s e-commerce platform or re-upping a subscription.  The canonical example of primary engagement media done right is the ""Not Boring"" author Packy McCormick, who, perhaps predictably, has also morphed into a crypto thought leader and investor. He cultivates an audience through his newsletter, creates hugely influential sponsored deep-dives for that audience, and also gets his readers to invest in his fund. That’s a lot of primary engagement for a solo operator. And you’re not exactly seeing BuzzFeed getting [liquidity providers] for its latest GameFi fund from its readership.  Small Web 3 media today  What types of Sybil-resistant crypto media do we have today? For starters, many such projects shy away from using the word “media” at all. They might call themselves decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), communities or some other variation of those words.  The aforementioned FWB is one example. Hold a certain balance of FWB tokens and you get access to its hot events and in-the-know chat. But what’s less talked about is its editorial division, which was one of the first things the group spun up, even before its now legendary parties.  FWB editorial now comprises feature stories in the form of Works in Progress, or WIP, ranging from “an oral history of Crypto Coven” to an extended metaphor on how Alcoholics Anonymous is really an 86-year-old DAO. It also publishes a weekly newsletter called TL;DR, which is essentially a form of local journalism (you need 1 FWB to read it). Instead of journalists covering different community boards or town hall meetings, writers discuss what went down on the FWB Discord server’s warren of channels, threads and voice chats.  Water and Music, founded by journalist Cherie Hu, is another crypto media outfit that benefits from primary engagement. It co-writes research reports with dozens of its community members on how technology is changing the music industry, paying them in its own STREAM token. (Disclosure: I advised Water and Music as part of my contribution to the Seed Club accelerator.) You can join the community (read: Discord server) by paying a good old-fashioned subscription, but then take part in things like co-writing reports using the token. Water & Music has 1,500 paying subscribers, and they’re mostly people whose jobs are affected by tech in music.  Forefront is another content-heavy project that eschews the “media” label, preferring instead to call itself a “port of entry” to Web 3. It publishes a podcast, hosts a data offering, and sends out a weekly newsletter. Like Water & Music, it rewards contributors in its FF token, and you become a community member by holding some FF to begin with.  Conclusion  While the Web 2 media world is still grappling with a shift to reader-supported business models, crypto media can show the way with Web 3-enabled features. It can swap proprietary paywalls with universally readable wallets. It can turn passive readers into active co-creators with token incentives. And it can tell both the unfolding story of crypto media as it is creating it themselves.

42394243,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvag3V,1649178678,How Crypto Is Changing Philanthropy,"Crypto philanthropy differs significantly from traditional ways of giving. These differences are changing donor demographics, funding models and even the reasons for giving.  The rising frequency of these crypto donations suggest this method of giving will play an enduring role in the nonprofit sector and perhaps transform philanthropy. The availability of crypto for giving has already spurred new waves of younger people to consider philanthropy and helped smaller charities compete for donations, but these may only be first steps as digital assets embed themselves more firmly in our lives.  Tanvi Ratna is the CEO of Policy 4.0, a research and advisory body working on policy approaches for digital assets.  Skyrocketing crypto donations  Last year was the largest ever for crypto donations by far. According to Fidelity Charitable, the financial services giant’s nonprofit that advises donors on charitable giving, around 45% of cryptocurrency investors donated to charities in 2020, compared to 33% of general investors. Fidelity Charitable received around $331 million in cryptos compared to $28 million in 2020. In its annual report, Giving Block, a crypto donation platform, reported $69 million in total donation volume last year, a massive 1,558% spike from 2020.  The ease of transferring cryptos to any part of the world allows charitable organizations to have donors globally. Many international charity organizations have started accepting crypto donations. UNICEF launched a new financial vehicle, CryptoFund, to deal with cryptocurrencies. Big organizations such as the Red Cross and Greenpeace have also started accepting crypto.  Read More: Anonymous Crypto Donors Are Changing Philanthropy  Crypto donations help nonprofits that are unable to get funding due to government restrictions. In 2010, WikiLeaks, an international non-profit that publishes news leaks was blacklisted by the U.S. Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and PayPal (PYPL) blocked its funding. Now, WikiLeaks receives millions in crypto donations. Despite this unprecedented growth, cryptocurrency philanthropy remains a niche form of giving and differs from traditional approaches in many ways.  The pool of cryptocurrency users is, on average, much younger than traditional donors to philanthropy. Over 60% of cryptocurrency users are under the age of 40. In the U.S., the average age of crypto users is 38 whereas the average age of donors is 64.  United Way, an international charity organization, started accepting crypto in 2014. Analytics data from its website show that the average user is 45 to 65 years old and 80% are female. Meanwhile, the average age of visitors to United Way’s crypto donation site is 25 to 35 years old and 80% are male. Cryptocurrency is drawing younger people to philanthropy in large numbers.  Responding to causes publicized on social media  Most cryptocurrency donations come from young, tech-savvy adults who support causes receiving more attention online. These donors may read heartfelt stories and bond emotionally to particular events. For instance, narratives shared on Twitter related to the Russia-Ukraine war have led to about $100 million in crypto donations to help Ukraine.  Similarly, social media became a COVID-19 helpline with global reach when India struggled with the second wave of the pandemic, also leading to crypto donations. Among the donors was Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who gave around $1 billion to India’s COVID-19 relief in shiba inu (SHIB) tokens that soared in value around the same time.  In 2021, the Tor Project, a popular non-profit for internet freedom and privacy, received 58% of its donations in cryptocurrencies. This largesse reflected crypto donors’ affinity for such causes as data privacy compared to others.  To be sure, some crypto donors may often be puzzled about which non-profit or cause they should support. But this challenge is common in philanthropy.  Recently, Giving Bock has introduced impact index funds or cause funds. These funds will help donors make informed decisions and potentially open them to a wider range of opportunities than they might otherwise have considered..  Traditional philanthropy has focused more on popular non-profits. Many donors have been more inclined to international charity organizations skilled in communicating their success, but the trend may be costing smaller and equally outstanding organizations who could also use the support.  Read More: Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity)  Cause-based funds on crypto donation platforms cover different areas including education, disaster relief, food and the environment. Donors can support a particular cause rather than choosing a specific non-profit organization with the non-profits receiving an equal share of the donated amount. This structure gives smaller non-profits equal footing, and ensures that the wider cause receives more attention than larger, more popular non-profits.  Cheaper transaction costs  Donors may find crypto philanthropy appealing for various reasons. Crypto investors can avoid capital gains tax through donations. Donating long-term appreciated assets directly can also unlock additional funds for charity, and there are potential savings for donors and non-profits on transaction fees that are embedded in traditional financial services platforms.  Transaction costs for receiving crypto donations areless than those for credit or debit card, which was the preferred method of giving for 63% of donors worldwide, according to the 2020 ""Global Trends in Giving Report."" According to Charity Navigator, the processing fee on credit card transactions – a direct deduction from the charity amount – can range from 2.2% to 7.5%.  Meanwhile, a normal wire transfer of $2,000 from the U.S. to India may cost $30 to $50 extra in transaction charges. The gas fees for the same amount when transferred through the Ethereum blockchain can be around $10 to $15. Moreover, there are other blockchains with even smaller fees. Also, the transaction time in crypto can be as low as a few seconds or minutes, whereas, cross border transfer of fiat takes hours or even a few days.  Attractive tax deductions  Donating cryptocurrencies to non-profits is tax deductible in the U.S. U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, among other countries. However, converting crypto to fiat can trigger capital gain taxes.  By donating a long-term appreciated asset directly, an investor can deduct the fair market value of the crypto at the time of a contribution. For example, If you bought your crypto for $1,000 and it appreciated to $2,000, you can deduct the $2,000 value.  If you convert $2,000 to fiat, you have to write off 20% of $2,000 paid in taxes from the donation amount. As a result, investors can save at least 20% to 30% on taxes.  Read More: Crypto-Philanthropy Is Here. What Will It Do?  Protecting donors' anonymity  Nonprofits find it easier to target existing donors than to find new donors. As a result, donors often prefer to remain anonymous as the pressure to give increases. Similarly, donating a big amount may require the completion of know-your-customer (KYC) and other personal identification requirements.  Donating in crypto helps donors preserve their anonymity even while donating millions of dollars. However, such anonymity might not last long as many countries increase their crypto regulations.  As of 2021, more than 1,300 nonprofits accepted crypto donations. Crypto philanthropy is inspiring young people to give by enabling direct donations and cause-based impact investing in unprecedented ways. In turn, the switch from organization-focused to cause-based funding will encourage crypto adoption among small nonprofits. These changes could open a new world of opportunity for nonprofits and disrupt traditional forms of giving.

42421195,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIeb,1649178420,Jeff Kauffman: DAOs Will Own Big Brands,"Jeff Kauffman loved to skydive. He was obsessed. He wanted to connect with other skydiving junkies so he turned to the power of the internet. He used a hot new website to create a hub for this community: MySpace.  This was back in 2005. Facebook was still only on college campuses. At the time the group was almost comically small; the MySpace page was just “Skydive Dallas,” intended only for local skydivers. “It’s the most niche thing you could possibly do,” says Kauffman with a laugh.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  But that’s how long he has been creating online communities. Eventually he launched a skydiving group on Facebook, he expanded beyond Dallas and soon he scaled it to the world’s largest such group. Then he built communities with brands. Over the next 15 years, Kauffman focused on Web 1 and then Web 2 brand building, where his clients ranged from GameStop to Dr. Pepper to Chick-fil-A. He enjoyed it. He loved it.  And then the game changed.  “Unfortunately, the way Facebook and Twitter evolved, they didn’t really nurture online communities the way we had hoped for,” says Kauffman. The new rules of the road: Communities were out, paid advertising was in. You could no longer truly engage with your customer; you just paid to serve an ad. In early 2020 he took a hard look at himself and thought, “I can’t run another carousel ad on Instagram.” He didn’t know what was next, but he knew he was done with the Web 2 grind.  Almost on a lark, Kauffman went to the website of Andreessen Horowitz (the powerhouse venture capital firm), and he followed the links to every investment the firm has ever made. For weeks he studied these investments. He ruled out verticals like biotech and space (he wasn’t exactly an expert) but he focused on media, culture and entertainment. “I was just like, ‘What’s the future? What’s coming?’,” he said. In the course of this research, he stumbled upon a term he had never heard before: “social token.”  Hmmmm. That seemed interesting. Thanks to his social media background, Kauffman’s a whiz at scraping Twitter and using “listening tools” to better understand a topic. So he went to work. “Within three days I understood the entire landscape of who's talking about social tokens,” says Kauffman. “I started building word clouds around who's associated with who, who's using the term the most, who's followed the most.”  Kauffman began publishing daily insights on social tokens and the native Web 3 space. People began to read and get it. He started tagging influential people in the space including Jess Sloss, the founder of Seed Club (a social token accelerator). He whipped up research reports and analyses of these new companies.  He had a sense that Web 3 would be the future of brands, and he wanted to learn by doing. So he created JUMP, as in “Jump into Web 3,” a Discord-based network of branding ad execs – from mainstream companies – who are curious about Web 3. Jump is essentially a bootcamp for Web 3 branding.  Kauffman keeps the member data private, but says that “at least 200 of the top Fortune 500 companies” have brand managers who have joined Jump. “Take any big brand that you can think of, and they have multiple people inside the [Jump] community.” (And Jump is now on the radar of Morning Brew, the business publication, which noted that Jump has “two pretty clear use cases: as a platform for networking and as a safe space to ask questions.”)  So where, exactly, are we all jumping? Kauffman’s not entirely sure. But he shares predictions on how Web 3 will change branding (including rewards programs “on steroids”), is bullish on a resurgence of community building and boldly predicts that within the next five years one of these communities will “purchase a Fortune 1000 brand.”  This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  You’ve called the early days of Web 2 a “golden era,” where brands were really able to build communities. What do you mean by that exactly?  For a soap brand, for example, you could actually build an online community and get product feedback in real time. One of the brands I worked on was “Boudreaux's Butt Paste.”  [Important note to reader: Get your mind out of the gutter. This is a diaper rash cream, for babies.]  So for first-time parents, you have no idea what you're doing. You're trying to figure it out. You're using this product and the parenting communities were just thriving. For a product like Boudreaux's Butt Paste, we could bring the community together and create this space.  And then, in real time, we could have parents saying, ""What's happening here?"" And we could start to help them. Even if it wasn’t selling the product, we could provide some sort of support. We had a real-time conversation of trying to solve problems. It creates a better bond. And everybody gets served better when the community is at the center. Customers get a better product, and the brands get loyal customers.  Everyone knows that the average consumer has soured on Facebook. But you say that brands have, too. What’s the reason?  The ad dollars just got more and more expensive, to the point where the ROI got stripped out of it. It became a race to the bottom. And, over time, [Facebook] imposed handcuffs around, ""All right, if you want to engage and talk to your customers or your potential customers online, you have to pay for it. And oh, by the way, if you're successful, all of those learnings are going to be shared with everybody else. And that’s going to continue to drive costs up."" It just became incredibly limiting.  The best strategy is actually not to sell NFTs. It's to give them away for free  What led to the creation of Jump?  In 2020, when I was going through my discovery process, I created a trends deck. And I presented these concepts [in one-on-one Zoom meetings] before anybody in agencies was talking about [non-fungible tokens] or social tokens or [decentralized autonomous organizations]. You can go look at Google search trends from back then; it’s tiny. I was presenting these concepts. And everybody within the agency and brand network said the exact same thing. They're like, “Holy crap, that's cool. It solves so many problems. I don't understand anything that you just said. I never heard of it, but it's cool. And I don't know where to get started.""  I heard those things over and over. And I realized, ""Oh, the best place to get started is to build a community for marketing and advertising professionals."" Because you can present decks all day long. But until you experience it, and you're in it, it's so hard to know how to build and how to create. You have to experience it first.  Right, learning by doing.  The best way I felt I could teach the entire industry was to create something like this. That’s how I could scale these ideas and move the industry forward. What I just wanted to say was, ""Let's create this community to help you jump into Web 3.""  Then they can take those learnings inside of all their agencies and brands, and start to execute. So, that's the reason Jump exists.  What are some ways that branding will change as a result of Web 3?  The low-hanging fruit is that brands can create communities in Web 3, using NFTs and social tokens. And then they can create experiences around that community.  If you have a group of people that hold the same token, what can they do? They can move anywhere, both physically [in real life] and online URL. So what a really savvy brand can do is say, “Okay, cool, here's my community, here's my customer base."" The best strategy is actually not to sell NFTs. It's to give them away for free. Give them away, and put them in the hands of your best customers.  Now you’ve basically created a handshake and a relationship. And you say, ""I don't need you to have a username and password. I don't need to store any of that stuff. I don't need to have some sort of ID check at a concert.” This is already happening. Your NFTs can go in your Apple wallet. You can just show up IRL, but also URL, and you can just enter any experience that the brand has created.  How about loyalty rewards programs?  Loyalty programs are definitely massive. In the old world, while they did create loyalty it was sort of this loyalty where you felt like, “Man, all my points are stuck there. And I want to use them, but it's because I'm locked in.”  Right, because there’s nothing else you can do with them.  Right. Whereas now [with Web 3], as long as the brand is building in the open environment, the loyalty programs are on steroids. Why? Because now you are an owner in the loyalty program. You own your place in it because you own the tokens.  What’s an example of a traditional brand doing smart things with Web 3?  Take Time magazine. Now Time is able to connect the readers to the creators – the writers and photographers – that they love. They can do that by selling NFTs. In partnership with those creators, Time can split the royalties. Then the people who hold those NFTs can access a community of others who are passionate about the creators, or the photos, or the print journalism.  What does that do for Time exactly?  So now, without being ad supported, Time has this way to say, “Hey, readers, you love these creators. We’re going to build the infrastructure of bringing you all together. We have a business model and a revenue stream because of the primary NFT sale and the royalties. We can share that with the creators themselves. Oh, and now you, as a reader, actually own what you purchase. So you can trade it. And if you happen to be on to something early, before other people, before that demand comes in, you have ownership and upside in this network. And oh, if you add more to the experience as a reader or as a subscriber, and that experience increases in value, if you want, you can sell out of that network and exit, and actually realize a profit.""  Now let’s go even bigger. Give us a bold, “out there” prediction about what’s going to happen with Web 3 and branding in the future.  So, the absolute craziest thing that's going to happen within five years is a community is going to form without a brand involved, and this community is going to purchase a Fortune 1000 brand.  Okay, that’s bold! Please elaborate.  It’s going to be hard for the big brands to really execute in a way that’s native to Web 3. When anything gets big and is old, it doesn't move as fast. There are lots of moving parts.  Whereas Web 3 is unlocking new capital and new resources that haven’t been unlocked before. Web 3 does not need Coca-Cola's ad dollars. And because online communities can form so quickly, and they can support themselves through this economic engine of royalties and primary sales of NFTs, they actually can generate a lot of capital. Yuga Labs is a really good example.  I was just about to say that. The Bored Apes guys are already big enough to buy any number of companies.  Exactly. And one of these communities is going to unlock such enormous value that these brands are basically going to say, ""You know what? This community and this DAO just offered us a lot of money to buy our company. If our fiduciary duty is to do right by our shareholders, and there's actually a legal entity to sell this into, I think we need to sell it.”  I think we could see an alcohol brand get purchased by a community.  What’s a concrete example of a brand where this might make sense?  I think we could see an alcohol brand get purchased by a community. Like a whiskey community just comes in and says, ""You know what? We're going to activate this whiskey brand everywhere. We have the resources, and we're actually going to buy an alcohol brand.""  When we spoke a few months ago, you floated the idea of an eco-focused Web 3 community deciding to partner with Patagonia, given the brand’s environmental ethos. Could you see an eco-DAO buying Patagonia?  Actually, Patagonia is a really interesting example. The founder owned 100% of it. And then his plan is to essentially say, ""Now it's an employee-owned company, there [are] no outside shareholders."" And that's great. It really keeps the culture intact, and everybody's there for the mission and the values. But that next level is actual community and customer ownership, not just employee ownership.  Interesting.  If we just scan the history of time, we went from a king who owned everything, then to this invention of a country that granted ownership and said, ""You know what? You can own your land, and we're actually going to protect it.”  Then it evolved to families. And then to corporations. So you went from kings to families to corporations. And with corporations, at first just the leaders of the company owned it, not the employees. Then with the Silicon Valley era, the employees could own part of it.  Now we’re entering an era where the actual end-customer very much owns a stake.  That’s wild. Love it. Thanks for the time and have fun at Consensus.  This story is part of Road to Consensus.

However, as the rally had slowed down and the inevitable market correction had begun, sentiment had begun to shift once again into the negative. This had caused the Fear &amp; Greed Index to reverse out of the greed territory, finally ending in neutral. Now, the market remains at a standstill waiting for the next move. Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index In Neutral The crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index helps map out how investors are feeling towards the market. Currently, it is neither good nor bad which has seen the index languishing in neutral territory. It is important to note that sentiment had driven far into greed as bitcoin had made its way to $47,000 but now, most of that positive sentiment seems to have washed away after bitcoin had made a slight decline that brought it back into the $46,000 region.

Crypto miners have been facing increasing scrutiny for their carbon footprint in the past year or so, and some have taken steps to move toward renewable energy. Marathon has pledged that its operations will be 100% carbon neutral by the end of 2022.  The Hardin bitcoin (BTC) mine is hosted by Beowulf, according to a Marathon investor presentation in March. Beowulf also owns the coal power plant nearby that powers the mine. The mine has space for 30,000 Bitmain Antminer S19 mining rigs, which together could generate as much as 3.3 exahash/second of computing power.  The transition is set to take place in the third quarter of this year in a staggered fashion to avoid downtime, Marathon said.  The crypto mining company didn't specify where the machines will be moved to or what ""more sustainable sources of power"" it will use. CEO Fred Thiel said the company's current strategy is to deploy mining rigs ""behind the meter"" at sustainable power stations, meaning the facilities are close to an energy producer and can draw power without going through the grid.

42423583,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2bTXh,1649174941,Dogecoin Rallies Again After Elon Musk Joins Twitter Board,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is up 11%, per Messari data, following Twitter’s (TWTR) announcement of Elon Musk as the newest member of its board of directors.  As part of the deal to join the board, Musk has agreed to not bring his stake any higher than 14.9% from the current 9.2%. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and Musk exchanged tweets Tuesday morning expressing their excitement and interest in working together.  Agrawal: “Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to the board.”  Musk: “Looking forward to working with Parag and Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months!”  It’s the second spike in two days for dogecoin on Musk/Twitter-related news. While Monday’s move quickly reversed, DOGE currently has been rising, now topping $0.16 for the first time in two months.  Over the past few months Musk, the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) has promoted dogecoin, even allowing for DOGE to be accepted for payment at Tesla’s supercharging stations and its online merchandise store. Now the largest individual owner of Twitter shares and a board member, Musk could push for DOGE payments to somehow be integrated into the social media company’s platform.  Bob Iaccino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank, doubts that will happen. “It’s wishful thinking on the part of those invested in dogecoin,” said Iaccino. “If anything, his position on Twitter’s board makes it harder for him to use Twitter (if we were to assume he was deliberately using Twitter for this purpose) to pump the price of anything at all. He is in much more specific danger of regulatory action if he does that.”  “The speculation is that advertisers could be able to pay DOGE for ads and for other uses on Twitter,” said Kryptomon Chief Marketing Officer Tomer Nuni. “We have seen the same happening when Tesla revealed the ability to pay for its goods with DOGE. So the speculation could be around Musk’s businesses and stakeholdings starting to accept crypto, as Tesla does.”  As has become a habit for the Tesla CEO, this week’s actions might already have him on the Security and Exchange Commission’s radar. Regulatory filings show that Musk filed a form 13G with the agency on April 4, officially reporting his ownership of more than 5% of Twitter. The form, however, states the person acquiring said securities is doing so “not with the effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer,” which would include joining the board.  If the buyer of shares wishes to become an activist or join the board, that would require the filing of a form 13D, in which those intentions would be stated.  “It’s possible his securities lawyers think they’ve found a clever loophole that lets him use the short form,” a lawyer on Twitter wrote.

42423587,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2bTfh,1649174401,Ethereum Scaler Boba Network Valued at $1.5B in $45M Series A,"Boba Network, a novel system for improving Ethereum’s transaction capacity, has raised $45 million from a wide range of investors that included cryptocurrency exchange giants Huobi, Crypto.com and BitMart.  In a sign of the times, the funding round for improved crypto plumbing even included backing from Paris Hilton. Boba Network said the Series A valued the firm at $1.5 billion.  A large amount of attention (and dollar value) is focused on bypassing the latency and transaction costs of the oversubscribed Ethereum blockchain. The Boba Network, which bills itself as a “next-generation optimistic rollup scaling solution,” not only betters Ethereum’s throughput by bundling and sequencing transactions off the main chain, but also addresses the blockchain’s computational limitations.  The inability of Ethereum smart contracts to handle things like complex machine-learning algorithms is a trade-off the layer 1 network makes in favor of decentralization, said Boba Network founder Alan Chiu.  “All of the other efforts in scaling Ethereum are focused on making it faster and cheaper, but we really wanted to focus on an additional dimension of scalability that’s been neglected, and that’s Ethreum’s computational limitations,” said Chiu in an interview.  Read more: Boba Network Launches as Ethereum’s Newest Layer 2  For example, someone coding smart contracts in Ethereum’s programming language Solidity is unable to include precise calculations for square roots, Chiu pointed out, because the blockchain was not designed to replicate computational complexity across an entire network of decentralized nodes and achieve consensus.  However, in the case of Ethereum overlay systems, such as optimistic and zero-knowledge roll-ups, computations happen once and then cryptographic proofs are written back to layer 1 in order to prove that the transactions were processed correctly.  “Layer 2s [companion systems] have single instance sequencers that act as block producers,” said Chiu. “So we set off to modify Geth [a programming language for running Ethereum nodes] in such a way that smart contracts on Boba can call any external API. Suddenly, you can do machine learning off-chain and have the results come back to your smart contract, atomically, meaning in the same transaction, in the same block.”  Boba fête  In terms of use cases, Boba’s hybrid off-chain compute services can enable decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that are backed by proprietary and sophisticated trading algorithms, and non-fungible token (NFT) lending based on machine learning-trained valuation models.  The system also broadens horizons when it comes to things like gaming assets, said Chiu, or syncing up DeFi with real-world assets and metaverse properties, as well as creating on-chain rewards based on user activities on social media.  “You can write smart contracts that call a Twitter API; if you want to, for example, reward users for performing certain actions on Twitter, and automate that whole verification and rewarding process,” Chiu said. “You can create on-chain assets that are synchronized with your gaming engine that runs off-chain, or with the metaverse that runs off-chain.”  The $45 million funding round included celebrity backing from Dreamers VC, a firm founded by actor Will Smith and Japanese soccer star Keisuke Honda.

42423588,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2bThh,1649174170,"Digital Euro May Get Easier AML Rules Than Bitcoin, EU Commissioner Says","The EU’s potential digital euro will face money laundering checks – but not necessarily ones as strict as those currently planned for regular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC), the European Commission’s Mairead McGuinness told CoinDesk Tuesday.  In an exclusive interview, McGuinness, the Commission’s most senior financial services official, promised a role for private intermediaries like banks should a European central bank digital currency (CBDC) be implemented, and said there would be new laws ahead of any decision to issue.  The European Central Bank (ECB) has said it is exploring a digital form of state-backed currency to complement banknotes and coins as people’s lives and spending habits go increasingly online. The bank is currently working through a series of policy questions before deciding whether to press ahead.  In a recent, controversial vote, lawmakers at the European Parliament favored tough anti-money laundering (AML) rules for bitcoin payments, requiring customers to be identified for even the smallest transactions. But privacy concerns could mean a different regime applies to the EU’s own digital currency, McGuinness said.  “A digital euro should comply with AML requirements but this is different to the current discussion on cryptoassets,” she said in a written interview. “We will be assessing whether a higher level of privacy should be made available, in particular, for low-value transactions, depending on the risk characteristics of the digital euro.”  While the ECB would issue the digital euro, payment service providers – typically the commercial banks that issue credit cards – will have a “key role” in finding and identifying customers, distributing the currency and offering extra services on top, she said.  “Intermediaries would have to ensure the onboarding of users and perform AML checks,” she said. “The digital euro is expected to be factored in to different payment solutions that payment services providers offer.”  A presentation given by ECB officials to finance ministers yesterday suggests in practice there could be multiple different kinds of wallets available to hold a digital euro with fewer checks associated with lower-risk payments. Smaller payments could potentially be fully offline and private, the presentation said, analogous to how cash is used today.  But the ECB can’t make any formal decision to issue until new laws are in place, McGuinness said.  “The Commission plans to adopt a proposal for a regulation in Q1 2023,” she said.  A public consultation to prepare the ground for that law was published by McGuinness earlier Tuesday.

Yellen will outline how the Treasury Department views cryptocurrencies as an emerging part of the U.S. economy Thursday at American University in Washington, D.C. The 10:30 a.m. ET speech is expected to echo some of the sentiments expressed previously in President Joe Biden’s executive order calling for further scrutiny on the industry.  ""Secretary Yellen will make the case for a consistent and comprehensive policy framework that promotes responsible innovation of digital assets and appropriately assesses and mitigates the risks they may pose,"" according to a Tuesday statement issued by the Treasury Dept.  Yellen's agency, as well as the Biden administration and federal regulatory agencies have been devoting a lot more attention to crypto since last year – especially toward stablecoins. The Treasury Dept. was instrumental in drafting last year’s report from the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets that marked the government’s opening salvo on establishing rules for dollar-backed stablecoins.  U.S. regulators have been leaning heavily on Congress to authorize new rules that govern stablecoin issuers in much the same way the government oversees banks. If lawmakers fail to produce results, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve are planning to use another channel – the umbrella group of top regulators known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council – to push for new oversight, despite limits on the council’s powers.  An early crypto skeptic during her time as Fed chair, Yellen has since struck a more careful tone that acknowledges the industry’s financial innovations and that digital tokens and decentralized finance are playing increasingly important roles in Americans’ investments.

Dolev estimates that Coinbase may spend up to $300 million this year on its NFT business while overall company profitability could see headwinds, along with higher operating expenses.  “In a year in which profitability may be challenged, we question the strategic rationale of chasing NFTs, especially as interest in NFTs appears to be dwindling,” Dolev wrote.  Dolev lowered his revenue estimates for Coinbase, citing lower-than-expected Q1 volume and medium-term pressure on average transaction revenue per user owing to the new NFT marketplace. The investment bank maintained a neutral recommendation on Coinbase, but lowered its price target to $190 from $220.  Despite Mizuho’s bearish outlook on Coinbase’s NFT segment, others on Wall Street are expecting strong revenue gains from it. Needham estimated that, in a bullish case, Coinbase could see an additional $1.26 billion in revenue through its NFT business. In January, Goldman Sachs said Coinbase was still the “blue-chip way” for investors to gain crypto exposure.  Shares of Coinbase were down 5.6% to $180.90 on Tuesday, while the price of bitcoin was up slightly over the last 24 hours.

42422846,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qTfh,1649170847,Lightning Labs Raises $70M to Bring Stablecoins to Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is getting a boost by way of a new Taproot-enabled protocol known as Taproot Asset Representation Overlay, or Taro (like the root vegetable, not the playing cards). Taro is an open-source protocol powered by the Lightning Network (LN).  On Tuesday, Elizabeth Stark, co-founder and CEO of Lightning Labs, announced Taro and its bid to bring assets, like stablecoins, to the Bitcoin blockchain.  In addition to Taro, Lightning Labs also announced that it raised $70 million in Series B funding, led by Valor Equity Partners and joined by global asset manager Baillie Gifford.  Stark said Taro improves Bitcoin’s functionality and is possible because of Taproot, an upgrade that was activated last year. Taproot featured three upgrades: Schnorr signatures, Tapscript and Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST). Taproot provides efficiency, privacy and flexibility gains to Bitcoin, but only if it is built into tools for users by developers. Taro represents what might become possible when Taproot is put to work.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Lightning Labs Director of Business Development Ryan Gentry said the protocol is “uniquely enabled by Taproot to embed spending conditions into MASTs without disclosing all details to the blockchain. Using MASTs, Taro embeds data for new assets such that these assets can all be treated as bitcoins.”  How it works  Lightning Labs describes Taro as an asset overlay network on Bitcoin. The security of Taro is based on embedded consensus, which means that transactions on Taro include Bitcoin data that needs to be verified on the Bitcoin blockchain.  There are additional rules to govern that data as defined by the Taro protocol, similar to how LN is an overlay network that uses Bitcoin smart contracts but has its own set of rules to enable the instantaneous transfer of bitcoin (BTC).  These are rules the Bitcoin blockchain doesn't necessarily care about. On that point specifically, Stark mentioned in the same CoinDesk interview that “you issue [the asset] on-chain and then you bring complexity to the end points,” the end point being the Taro protocol.  Most importantly, Lightning Labs released the technical specifications for Taro as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) so that the protocol can be built with feedback from the broader developer community.  While Taro might become available first on lnd, Lightning Labs’ implementation of LN, its status as an open-source protocol will allow other popular LN implementations, like ACINQ’s eclair or Blockstream’s Core Lightning, to use Taro. During the interview, Stark pointed to this as a critical aspect of Taro. When Lightning Labs announced its Series A in 2020, she wrote that we were ""entering the decade of Lightning."" Two years into that decade, she said Lightning Labs remains committed to being open source.  A critical distinction between Taro and other stablecoins, like UST on Terra, is that Taro is only the infrastructure to enable the movement of assets over Lightning, be they stablecoins or some other asset. Taro is not a stablecoin, collateralized, algorithmic or otherwise, it is simply infrastructure to enable the movement of assets. Developers still need to build projects using Taro.  Major funding  When asked about the $70 million Series B announced in conjunction with Taro, Stark said the combined approach was intentional.  “The goal of the announcement was to focus on the technology [Taro], raising money is solely the means, not the end,” Stark said.  The funds will be used to bolster Lightning Lab’s runway flexibility and act as fuel to grow the company, she said. Lightning Labs is still a small company with only 24 employees on its team page.  In addition to Valor Equity and Baillie Gifford, Goldcrest Capital, Kingsway, Moore Strategic Ventures, Brevan Howard, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, NYDIG and Silvergate CEO Alan Lane participated in the funding round.  Baillie Gifford, a traditional finance company with a long operating history, being in the investor group marks another entry into investing in crypto infrastructure after it invested in Blockstream and Blockchain.com. Stark mentioned that the asset manager is a “long-term-oriented investor, so they’re really a perfect fit for what we are trying to accomplish.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | LUNA | SPONSORED,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/05/lightning-labs-raises-70m-to-bring-stablecoins-to-bitcoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Torres (D-Calif.) and Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) on Monday introduced the Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador (ACES) Act, looking to mitigate risks to the U.S. financial system from El Salvador's adoption of bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender.  “El Salvador’s adoption ofbitcoin is not a thoughtful embrace of innovation, but a careless gamble that is destabilizing the country,” Torres tweeted Monday.  According to a release published by Torres, “the legislation directs the State Department to produce an analysis of El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin as legal tender and the risks for cybersecurity, economic stability and democratic governance in El Salvador, and create a plan to mitigate potential risks to the U.S. financial system.”  For reference on ""risks,"" El Salvador's GDP is roughly $25 billion versus U.S. GDP of $21 trillion.  The bill functions as a companion to the Senate bill introduced by senators James Risch (R-Idaho), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on Feb. 16. That legislation advanced out of committee on March 23, putting it on path to be voted on by the full Senate.

The fact that Copper, a crypto custody firm, is one of the U.K. crypto businesses stuck in the Financial Conduct Authority’s temporary registration process has been a problem for prospective investors Accel Partners and Tiger Global, the people said.  “Tiger, and presumably some of the other investors, had wanted to make the closing process tied to the FCA approval,” one of the people said. “So some combination of downsizings or pulling out of the round happened with the investor consortium.”  A second person said Accel had “walked away from the deal,” and that Tiger has cut its intended investment in the round to about a quarter of what was initially a nine-figure commitment.  Accel Partners did not respond to requests for comment. Tiger Global declined to comment. A Copper spokesperson said the firm could not comment since the round is ongoing.

Other firms that have been waiting in line for FCA approval include the likes of fintech major Revolut and crypto platform Blockchain.com, which recently announced a $14 billion valuation.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Analysts maintain a constructive outlook on bitcoin amid the cryptocurrency's triangular consolidation under the 200-day average. Calm in credit markets suggests Fed's liquidity tightening isn't as severe as widely feared.  Chartist Corner: Bitcoin forms a pennant.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Cory Klippsten, CEO, Swan Bitcoin  Andrew Wagner, co-founder, BlockRaiders Guild  Marina Niforos, affiliate professor, HEC Paris  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin's bullish momentum has weakened in the past eight days. The cryptocurrency is consolidating in a narrowing price range under its 200-day moving average of above $48,000.  Yet market observers remain confident that the sideways move will pave the way for more substantial gains.  ""The liquidation signals have reversed from February and March and show triggering of buy orders daily,"" Laurent Kssis, managing director and head of Europe at crypto exchange-traded fund firm Hashdex, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""Steady on-chain activity suggests limited downside risk. This hints that the next big move is likely to be positive, provided there is a sustained improvement on-chain driven by continued institutional investor demand.""  Investor demand has held up well despite bitcoin's stalled ascent. Digital-asset funds drew $180 million in the seven days through April 1, marking a second straight week of net inflows, according to a CoinShares report published Monday.  According to Glassnode, institutional investors have been allocating funds to bitcoin, ethereum and altcoins despite the fragile macro environment.  And while bitcoin has taken a back seat to other cryptocurrencies in recent days, as evidenced by the decline in the BTC dominance index, there is little reason to worry for bulls, according to Matthew Dibb, CEO and a co-founder of Stack Funds.  ""Flows over the last few days have been lighter, with more action in altcoins, particularly layer 1 coins and DeFi (decentralized finance),"" Dibb said. ""We don't see any cause for panic or significant reason for a bearish retracement. While there is some macro uncertainty regarding Fed and Russia, BTC has performed relatively well and is beginning to garner more support.""  Meanwhile, credit markets remain calm despite a max-hawkish Federal Reserve, indicating liquidity tightening isn't as severe as widely feared. That perhaps explains the prevalent bullish mood in bitcoin and stocks.  ""I think it's just a sign that the liquidity contraction has not lived up to the Fed's expectations. In addition, there is underlying solid buying in the Asian region, as China and Japan generally have rate cuts,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto-asset management company Blofin, said. ""That said, the liquidity contraction did not happen globally simultaneously, and we can still find some liquidity pumps.""  The stability in the credit markets, however, may encourage the Fed to take aggressive steps should inflation continue to rise. ""If the upcoming monthly consumer price index data are not good, the Fed may take aggressive measures, which will cause significant fluctuations,"" Ardern said.  The CPI for March is due next week. Ardern also cited the minutes of the March Fed meeting and the upcoming European Central Bank meeting as critical events to watch out for. ""The Fed minutes could provide some relevant information on the road map for shrinking the balance sheet,"" he said.

42411832,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDwP,1649164330,Ledger Nano S Plus Review: Good for Beginners,"What I liked:  Minimalistic, no-frills design  Simple navigation  Easy transfers  Supports NFTs and 5,500 cryptocurrencies  What I didn’t like:  Buying crypto directly from the wallet is tedious  Sole responsibility to safely store the cold storage  Overview of the Ledger Nano  The Ledger Nano S Plus is a hardware wallet designed for securely storing your cryptocurrency offline, including non-fungible tokens (NFT). It is a long-awaited upgrade of the brand’s crypto wallet for beginners aimed for those who want to secure their digital assets themselves.  To back up a bit, there are two types of wallets: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are connected to the internet and are typically available online or on your smartphone. Cold wallets cannot be accessed through the internet and are most often physical devices where cryptocurrencies can be stored securely offline. Cold wallets let you have complete control of your cryptocurrencies thanks to self-custody. It means that you hold the keys to the wallet and manage access to it, contrary to a wallet on an exchange, where the company holds your keys.  Read More: Custodial Wallets vs. Non-Custodial Crypto Wallets  The Ledger Nano S Plus’ predecessor, the Nano S, casts a long shadow. Launched back in 2016, it was a bestseller among hardware wallets, with the company reportedly selling over 4.5 million devices. However, most of the popular cryptocurrencies today were not around when the Nano S first came to market, and few people were interested in NFTs at the time.  Fast forward to the present: The new Nano S Plus seems to have caught up with the times. As crypto has moved even farther into the mainstream, the market has grown to include new wallets for users of all levels, from complete beginners to institutional-grade investors.  Read more: Your First Crypto Wallet: What Is a Crypto Wallet and How to Use It  In today’s market, the Nano S Plus will not only compete with myriad other hardware wallets but all the self-custodial, hot wallet solutions offered by exchanges and software providers, too.  Recent events have rejuvenated the conversation around the benefits of self-custody, such as the freezing of bank accounts connected to the Canadian trucker protest and sanctions placed on Russian accounts. These news stories are a sharp reminder that money isn’t worth much if you cannot access it.  What’s in the Nano Ledger box  The brand new Ledger comes in a matte black box with a silver silver sleeve. Opening it, you will find:  The Ledger Nano S Plus hardware  A USB cable to connect the Ledger to the computer (USB on one end, Type-C on the other)  A bright orange box with three notepads for the Secret Recovery Phrase (also known as seed phrase)  A pastel purple box with the manual instructions  A key-holder chain with a Ledger logo  The hardware wallet looks like a fancy, elegant thumb drive covered by a signature polished metal wing. The matte, rounded shell sports a small, monochrome screen of 128 x 64 pixels, which is perfectly large enough for the job.  The device has two buttons on the side for navigation. They are easy to use and accurate but feel wobbly and clunky, which botches the otherwise premium impression. On its top, you find the Type-C plug to connect the wallet to the computer.  The USB cable that comes within the box stays firm in the device, and the textile, shoelace-like cover keeps the cord untangled.  Overall, I loved the no-frills, less-is-more design. I can see how keeping it simple would help beginners and first-time owners avoid any confusion when navigating the wallet and its buttons.  How to set up the Ledger Nano S Plus  One of my worries about using cold storage prior to this trial was how complicated and intimidating it would be to get up to speed. That fear ended up being unfounded, at least with this device.  Setting up the hardware wallet was fairly easy and took less than 30 minutes. The instructions for each step in the process were clear to follow and the whole experience felt quite seamless.  First, you need to download and install Ledger’s app, called Ledger Live, from the company’s website or a mobile app store. It is available in desktop version (Windows, Mac) and mobile version (Android, iOS).  Once you’ve installed the app, you connect the thumb drive to the computer with the cable it came with. The Ledger has a Type-C socket and the other end of the cable is a standard USB plug. (A USB-to-Type-C converter would come in handy for connecting to a smartphone.)  At this point you’re going to want to grab a pen and a safe place to write some important information down.  The next step is to set the PIN code, which is four to eight digits long. It functions in a similar fashion as the unlock code for a phone. You will need it every time to turn on the hardware wallet and validate every transaction, so this is the first thing you’ll need to write down on paper. Do NOT take a photo of it or make any digital copy – this creates an avenue for hackers to steal your crypto (provided they find and gain access to your physical Ledger device).  Next comes the Secret Recovery Phrase: 24 randomly generated words, also called a seed phrase. This is the second thing you’re going to need to write down, and make sure you get all 24 words exactly right. The app will ask you to confirm the seed phrase by choosing the correct one from 4 choices. Repeat for all the 24 words.  The seed phrase is your last resort if something happens with the device, so it’s important to store this information somewhere safe and private. If you lose or damage your hardware ledger, you can recover your funds by purchasing a new Ledger device and importing your account by entering the 24 seed phrases. Lose the seed phrase, however, and your funds will be gone forever.  When this is all set, the software runs a security check on the hardware to see whether it has been compromised or not. This is more commonly a problem with second-hand hardware wallets, which is generally not recommended.  How to use Ledger Nano S Plus  To manage your assets with the Ledger Nano S Plus, you need two things:  A computer or a smartphone to connect to the wallet  The Ledger Live application  The Ledger Nano S Plus always needs to be connected to a device like a laptop or tablet to be used. More advanced (and expensive) cold wallets can work by themselves for most, using a device to manage the wallet won’t be an issue, plus you have the advantage of using a bigger screen than the Ledger’s display.  The sample gadget I tested had a limited selection of coins but Ledger says the wallet will support over 5,500 different cryptocurrencies when it goes on sale April 5, 2022.  The Ledger has an operating system called BOLOS (Blockchain Open Ledger Operating System). You can download plenty of additional applications from Ledger's own app store, Discover, via Ledger Live.  The storage of Nano S Plus has been upgraded to 1.5 megabytes, which offers plenty of space for its purpose, more than enough to install 100 applications.  How to add an account to your wallet  If you want to hold a specific cryptocurrency on the wallet, you have to download and install its application on the Ledger Live app. These apps grant you access to the blockchain of your chosen coin. Let’s say, you want to hold bitcoin on your Ledger. Here’s how you can do that:  Click on “Manager” on the left menu bar in the Ledger Live app on your computer or smartphone.  Unlock your Ledger with your PIN code.  The App Catalog will appear showing all the possible cryptocurrencies you can store in the wallet. Select the one you would like to store and click on install.  Then click “Add account” for that cryptocurrency.  A window pops up on your Ledger Live app and a sign on the Ledger’s screen to “Open app” for the chosen cryptocurrency. Push the two side buttons at the same time to proceed.  After a few seconds, you can name the account and you’re done.  Most of the bigger cryptocurrencies and their blockchains are supported by the Ledger Live app. It gets trickier when you delve deeper into lesser known coins, because they often require third-party wallets. If you are interested in them, it’s best to check Ledger’s website how you can store them.  How to move your crypto to cold storage  Moving assets from an exchange to cold storage is the most important function you will use a hardware wallet for.  These are the steps you’ll need to follow to achieve this using the Ledger Nano S Plus:  Connect the device and open the Ledger Live app.  Select “Receive” on the menu on the left and copy the address on your screen.  Log in to your exchange account and select withdraw funds (it varies by exchanges).  Paste the wallet address you copied from the Ledger Live and set the amount of tokens to withdraw.  This was the first time I’d ever moved digital assets from an exchange to cold storage, and the whole process was actually much faster and easier than I expected. Even making sure to get the address right was less intimidating than I thought.  As a test, I withdrew 10 MATIC from my exchange account to the Ledger Nano S Plus device. The tokens (minus the 0.1 MATIC transfer fee) appeared in the Ledger Live app within five minutes.  Processing time and fees depend on the blockchain you use for the transfer.  How to buy and sell crypto  Hardware wallets are a blockchain-only solution, so you cannot deposit and keep fiat currencies on it. This certainly makes them less convenient than hot wallets or exchanges but remember, what you lose on convenience you gain on security.  The Ledger lets you buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly on the device with a couple of third-party applications such as Banxa, Coinify and Moonpay. They act as intermediaries between the fiat and crypto world and let you use your dollars (or euros, pounds, pesos, etc.) to invest in cryptocurrencies.  These fiat-to-crypto on-ramps are key for making crypto accessible for everyday people. Unfortunately, though, most providers require extensive identification checks, charge outsized fees or don't serve certain regions or states. I spent an entire morning trying to find an on-ramp that could make a transaction.  The shortcoming of on-ramps are not Ledger’s fault but it points out a crucial obstacle for the crypto industry to solve. It is a missing piece of the puzzle that easily scares the less experienced users away. I recommend using exchanges for purchase and sales, and keeping the Ledger for storage.  Read more: How to Store Your Bitcoin  So, for whom is the Ledger Nano S Plus intended?  The Nano S Plus is ideal for people who have already made their first steps in crypto, are thinking about holding (or HODLing) digital assets as a long-term investment and want to take full control over the ownership of their digital assets.  For those who are just starting their journey in crypto, beginning with a hardware wallet is perhaps too big of a step – unless, of course, you’re investing large sums of money and need the additional security that comes with collet wallet storage.  Risks of self-custody  The extra security comes at the expense of being completely responsible for your assets.  If you lose your physical device or misplace the written-down copy of your seed phrase, there is no way to recover access to your coins. The same happens with transactions. If you want to send crypto and make a mistake typing the receiver’s wallet address, there is no central authority at hand to reverse the transaction.  While hacking a hardware wallet is significantly more difficult than a software-based wallet solution connected to the internet, it’s not impossible. It just means someone has to take the added step of getting access to your physical device and your phrases in order to get at the assets.  Is the Ledger Nano S Plus worth your money?  If you are looking to start your journey with cold storage, the new Ledger Nano S Plus will not disappoint. With a $79 price tag, it's an inexpensive option for a first-time user to try it out.  Sure, there are wallets out there with more advanced specs. The Ledger Nano X, for example, has a larger screen, more memory to store coins, enables connecting with Bluetooth to your computer or use the hardware wallet without any connection for $149. Ultimately, I don’t see any reason why the average investor would need more than what the Nano S Plus offers.  The Nano S Plus does a fairly good job of keeping it simple and accessible for the crypto curious who want to take ownership of digital assets in their own hands. Navigating through the user interface was comfortable, and I never felt overwhelmed by the options.  All in all, the new Ledger Nano S Plus is a great option for modern crypto holders of all levels.  One caveat I would add for people holding small sums of crypto is that they should ask themselves: Is an extra layer of security necessary and worth the extra effort at their current level of investment? If the answer is still yes – or at least not a categorical no – the Ledger Nano S Plus is well worth your money.  One of the most exciting frontiers in self-custody is to make it as user-friendly and foolproof as possible without sacrificing security and ownership and I think the Ledger Nano S Plus succeeds in delivering that experience.

The call for ideas, which is seen as the first step toward legislation from Brussels on the topic, is being made even before any formal decision has been taken on whether to issue a digital currency in the first place.  The consultation, which is open until June 14, asks questions about issues with a potential digital euro such as the ease of use, availability, fees, standards and caps on holdings needed to safeguard financial stability. The digital euro could be used by residents of the EU, tourists or trade partners, the consultation said. The document is the likely precursor to drafting laws that could come out early next year.  It sets out ideas on how the design of a digital euro could protect privacy and allow anonymity between transacting parties or their banks. Privacy emerged as the top issue in a European Central Bank consultation about a digital euro last year and remains a source of controversy.  Read more: Europe's CBDC Designers Wrestle With Privacy Issues  The ECB is looking at how a plan to issue a digital euro might work in a phase that will last until September 2023. An ECB presentation given to finance ministers on Monday set out ways to protect privacy, a topic that topped a previous survey of people’s concerns about the new technology.  In a statement on Tuesday, national ministers from within the bloc – keen not to be usurped by the ECB on matters of public policy – said that new laws would be needed to underpin the measure and said the digital currency shouldn't replace regular banknotes and coins.  Starting in June, EU finance ministers will discuss other knotty issues such as the impact on financial stability and the role of private banks and payment firms in distributing a digital euro.

42395687,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyV4S,1649163612,Terra Wallet Leap Raises $3.2M in Private Token Sale,"Leap, a startup building a non-custodial crypto wallet for the Terra blockchain, raised $3.2 million in funding co-led by CoinFund and Pantera Capital with contributions from Arrington Capital, Accel and Terraform Labs, according to a press release.  Leap raised the funding via a private sale of its LEAP governance and utility token, and in a March litepaper earmarked 8% of the tokens for a private sale. If these estimates hold true, the funding round values the project at $40 million. Founder Sanjeev Rao declined to comment on the valuation.  Leap plans to bolster its engineering, design, product and marketing teams with the fresh capital, Rao said.  Leap's crypto wallet is similar to MetaMask and is a Chrome extension with over 4,000 downloads, according to Rao. Leap supports asset transfers, non-fungible token (NFT) trades and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications across the Terra ecosystem, which runs on Terra's LUNA token and the stablecoin UST. Rao said iOS and Android mobile apps are on the way.  Terra is in “hyper growth phase,” as Rao put it, with UST’s market cap soaring tenfold as the chain’s total value locked (TVL) tops $30 billion, second only to Ethereum, according to DeFi Llama.  Rao said that Terra is bringing “a lot of new users into the space,” therefore, Leap wallet allows for individuals new to crypto to interact with the blockchain through its integration of decentralized applications (dapps) and NFTs in one “super wallet.”  Terra wallets  Leap’s biggest competitor is Terra Station, Terraform Labs’ own non-custodial wallet. When asked about Terra Station, Rao said that “a good wallet experience makes or breaks when it comes to onboarding new users,” and Leap keeps up with the space’s rapid growth and changing needs, such as security, design and usability through its dapp integrations.  In the coming months, Leap will release a native governance token for a token-reward program for active wallets, according to Rao. Leap will also allow users to purchase NFT collections on the app.  Only the wallet users have access to their private keys in Leap’s non-custodial setup. This carries be-your-own-bank benefits while establishing personal responsibility, and thus increasing risk. People can still fall victim to copycat websites, Rao said.  Rao said Leap mitigates some of the scam risks by integrating directly with popular Terra-based DeFi protocols, allowing users to stake LUNA and UST without leaving the wallet.  “Being able to deposit in-wallet to Anchor [is] something we built quite early on, something people use a lot. Similarly, we've integrated multiple products from Stader labs, where now users have access to multiple staking options in-wallet.”  CoinFund and Pantera did not respond to CoinDesk's requests for comment by press time.",POSITIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LUNA | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/05/terra-wallet-leap-raises-32m-in-private-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43e7d89e00ddb69fe15d08c8a6f9d7155f421e7c-1280x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, has this growth changed the global market situation? Has everyone expected the new growth trend? In our previous article, we predicted $225 test for buyers. This target has been achieved, but the EGLD price remains in consolidation. At the bottom of the consolidation, buyers keep the price through the trend line. This trend line was formed in June 2021 and successfully helped buyers in difficult situations. The top of the current consolidation is held by sellers with their trend line from December 2021. https://www.tradingview.com/x/7SYTnS5Z/ The basic range of $126 is under the control of buyers. So far, this fact is true, our main scenario is the breakdown of this consolidation upwards with the first target of $277 and the final - $400. The main question is whether sellers will be able to lower the EGLD price to $150 before this growth wave. Though, such a price fall will only increase investors&apos; interest in buying the EGLD cryptocurrency. At this point, the risks to the investment are minimal, while the potential return reaches about 180%.

42395685,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyV2U,1649160005,Mapping Startup Hivemapper Raises $18M to Give Maps the Web 3 Treatment,"Crypto-enabled mapping startup Hivemapper is trying to give Google Maps a run for its money.  The San Francisco-based company has raised $18 million in a funding round led that was by Multicoin Capital. Some big names from crypto and technology also invested, including Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, the founders of the Solana blockchain; Jaron Waldman, a former Apple Maps executive; and Amir Haleem, CEO of Helium, which is another blockchain.  According to CEO Ariel Seidman, the funds will be used to support the mainnet launch of Hivemapper’s native HONEY token and to get more map contributors. In exchange for HONEY tokens, the map contributors install specially designed dashcams in their cars that share footage with Hivemapper, which is then used to create maps.  Seidman, who started Hivemapper as a non-crypto company in 2015, told CoinDesk he was inspired by the success and rapid growth of Helium, a crypto-incentivized network of wireless hotspots, which also began as a non-crypto company in 2013.  Read more: Helium Becomes Nova Labs After Raising $200M in Fresh Capital  Seidman envisions Hivemapper’s primary customer – at least for the next two or three years – will be businesses looking for a cheaper and more up-to-date alternative to Google Maps.  “Google’s maps are high quality but also very, very expensive,” Seidman said. “The entire mapping pipeline is exceptional, but its Achilles heel is the fact that it’s so expensive. Your ability to refresh an area is, for places like Lagos, Nigeria, or Manila or other locations – it becomes cost-prohibitive over time.”  Because Hivemapper sells equipment to independent contributors who have their own vehicles, the company's cost is much lower, Seidman explained.  “If you look in Palo Alto – Google Street View for University Avenue, which is in Google’s backyard – probably gets updated every 14 months,” Seidman said. “For the same price, we could probably do it once a week.”  HONEY token  Though the maps and data generated by Hivemapper contributors are open source and community owned, Seidman says Hivemapper will generate revenue by building tools that can then be licensed by companies.  Contributors will be rewarded with HONEY tokens which, like Helium’s native HNT token, could grow in value as the network takes off.  Seidman pointed out that many current contributors to map apps like Waze work for free, simply because they love the work.  “Even as wonderful as Waze was, there are now something like 25,000 Waze map editors. These are people sitting behind their computer screen editing maps … on behalf of what is effectively a multitrillion-dollar company,” Seidman said.  “And they don’t get paid, there’s nothing they get in return for that. They get, maybe, a Google T-shirt or a Waze hat, but that doesn’t sit right with me,” he added.  Hivemapper will also reward map editors – not just dashcam operators – with HONEY tokens.  The company’s first dashcam, which is being made in Pittsburgh, is expected to begin shipping in July.",POSITIVE,HNT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | HNT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/05/mapping-startup-hivemapper-raises-18m-to-give-maps-the-web-3-treatment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55d0cf2ff01021d19b874aaf74d2ae087abed00e-1600x1045.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Investors in the strategic funding round included crypto exchange Coinbase Ventures, blockchain technology company StarkWare and Section 32, a venture capital firm founded by Bill Maris, a former head of Google Ventures.  Parallel Finance plans to raise a Series B round during the second quarter in two tranches of $20 million to $30 million each at an undetermined valuation, CEO Yubo Ruan told CoinDesk in an interview.  Funding plans  Earlier this month, Parallel Finance released a “super app” bundle of six products in a bid to become a one-stop shop for decentralized finance (DeFi) systems. The initial launch included products related to crypto wallets, staking, crowdloans, cross-chain bridges, automated market making and yield farming.  The new funding will help Parallel Finance expand its super app on the Polkadot network and beyond by enabling Parallel to spend more on research and development and product expansion. It will also help the project gain new users and increase the total value locked (TVL) on the platform.  “We currently have around $700 million to $800 million TVL,” Ruan said. “We plan to increase that to $2 billion to $3 billion in the coming quarter.”  Road map  Parallel Finance is interested in working with strategic investor Coinbase Ventures on its ecosystem expansion and software plans, Ruan said. The protocol also plans to build on StarkWare’s StarkNet, a layer 2 ""scaling"" product that addresses Ethereum’s issues of slow speed and high transaction fees. Section 32, the venture capital firm, may help bring potential partners to the table as Parallel Finance moves to invest more in Web 3 projects.  Parallel Finance has plans to expand its app beyond the Polkadot ecosystem, initially with Ethereum. and wants to expand into the non-fungible token (NFT) business by supporting NFTs as collateral.  “The NFT holder can get access to a credit line or get access to capital they can borrow without having to sell to get liquidity,” Ruan said.  Valuation growth  Asked about the growth in valuation, Ruan noted that Parallel Finance has grown to 70 employees from about 10 to 20 employees since last August and has launched seven products since the platform was founded less than a year ago.  “I think growth and traction have helped us increase the valuation,” Ruan explained. “It’s also about our long-term plans about how to bring DeFi to mass adoption.”  Read more: Paradigm Invests $8.8M in DeFi’s Ribbon Finance",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | EXCHANGE,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/05/defi-super-app-parallel-finance-doubles-valuation-plans-up-to-60m-series-b,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c349d31cb701a4ca9d10b1796038fd244de7fae-1999x1499.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

FTX wants to continue solidifying its place in global digital asset markets, and sees IEX as a way to improve market structure for investors in a compliant and trusted manner, according to a statement Tuesday.  The size of FTX’s investment wasn’t disclosed, but an FTX spokesperson told CoinDesk it will become a “significant” shareholder of IEX. The deal is expected to close in May, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval.  “With this investment, we’re aligned with one of the most trusted and innovative companies in equities markets,” FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said in the statement. He added the two companies will “collaborate on the further establishment of crypto market structure and work closely with regulators, allowing institutions around the world to enter the marketplace seamlessly.""  IEX Group operates Investors Exchange LLC, which along with Katsuyama became known after being featured in Michael Lewis’ best-selling book “Flash Boys” in 2014, which detailed high-frequency trading’s impact on financial markets.  Katsuyama said IEX is well aligned with FTX and its vision to aid investors while also working closely with regulators to scale the digital asset industry. “The U.S. market should be the largest player in digital assets globally and we believe that this partnership will help facilitate that,” he said in the release.  Bankman-Fried has been a proponent of tighter crypto regulation in the U.S., saying it would be healthy for the market and investors.

However, so far these teeth are just erupting and do not pose a significant danger. But, the process has begun and it is important. The HBAR price was able to break the consolidation wedge up and test the $0.268 mark. This mark will create a problem for buyers for the second time on the way to the formation of a new growth trend. After the closing of the trading week on 28 March, buyers surrendered locally with a pin-up and with increased volumes. https://www.tradingview.com/x/xp6oTySa/ The week of trading on 4 April began with lower prices and testing buyers for strength. In the case of the capitulation of buyers near the mark of $0.268, their main target will be to keep $0.195. In the case of a re-test of this range, investors will have a great chance to buy HBAR at around $0.195 with low risks. An important point the $0.195 test should pass without updating the local low and without aggressive candles on smaller timeframes.

That's the signal from an indicator called Reserve Risk, which measures the risk-reward ratio of allocating to bitcoin based on the conviction of long-term holders. The metric compares the incentive to sell offered by the going market price to long-term holders resisting the temptation to liquidate.  Reserve Risk stood at 0.0024 at press time, having found acceptance under the green zone below 0.0027 in late January. The risk-reward ratio is considered attractive when the metric hovers in the green area.  ""This metric will trade at low levels when there is heavy investor accumulation and HODLing is the preferred market strategy,"" blockchain analytics firm Glassnode's weekly newsletter published Monday said.  In other words, a low reading indicates that conviction among HODLers – slang from long-term crypto investors – is high and they refuse to spend their coins. Therefore, there is an attractive risk/reward for prospective buyers to dip their toes into the market.  However, in the past, Reserve Risk has hovered in the green zone for prolonged periods, marking a slow transition from the final phase of the bear market to the mid-stages of a bull market. So, investors looking to add exposure to bitcoin, tracking the low Reserve Risk need to be patient or have the ability to endure long periods of underperformance before big returns manifest.  ""Reserve Risk has traded at historically undervalued levels for 77 days so far, although this is far shorter than the multi-year periods seen in 2015-17 and 2018-20. Note, however, that Reserve Risk generally signals undervaluation well into the bull market as HODLers typically commence distribution only after a new price [all-time high] is set,"" Glassnode's weekly report said.  Bitcoin was trading largely unchanged on the day at $46,600 at press time, according to CoinDesk data.  Reserve risk is calculated by dividing bitcoin's price at any point in time by the ""HODL Bank,"" as detailed by Glassnode, which represents the opportunity cost of holding an asset.

In 2020, the marketplace had €1.23 billion ($1.35 billion) in revenue, the police said.  The Russian-language marketplace also had a built-in bitcoin privacy mixer, which complicated tracing the transactions, said the police statement.  Hydra Market had been operating since 2015 and was accessible via the Tor browser. The site has been taken off the internet.

A long-term developer vision combined with no upfront investment requirements is an excellent place to start. Cryptopia wants to highlight those aspects and more through its blockchain gaming venture. Gaining Traction is Essential Despite the growing popularity of play-to-earn gaming, most projects have one crucial flaw in common. They all require players to either make an upfront investment or hold their rewards for long periods in the hopes of prices going up. While that is a sensible economic model, it also prevents the mainstream from embracing these projects from day one. Instead, most play-to-earn games only cater to existing crypto users rather than those looking to venture into the world of cryptocurrency through blockchain gaming. Cryptopia takes a different approach. It is one of the few games merging free-to-play and play-to-earn mechanics. That is nothing new, yet the games providing this option often lack content or user retention. Cryptopia provides multiple game modes for players to earn rewards and monetize in-game resources to counter those issues.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether were flat on Monday.  Insights: Indonesian investors are moving into crypto, a Gemini report found.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $46,700, up slightly t from where it stood 24 hours earlier. Ether was similarly up over the same period. Most other major cryptos were in the red. SOL and AVAX were recently down about 4%. DOT fell roughly 3%. LUNA, which was up about 3%, offered one bright spot.  Crypto trading continued to be well off levels of just a few months ago, underscoring investors' caution amid economic uncertainties inflamed by Russia's unprovoked aggression in Ukraine, although major equity indexes were up with the tech-heavy Nasdaq rising 1.9%.  U.S. President Joe Biden said in brief remarks to reporters that the U.S. would add to sanctions meant to cripple the Russian economy after satellite pictures showed massive civilian casualties in the town of Bucha near the Ukraine capital of Kyiv. Countries in the European Union have recently shown signs that they might ratchet back their dependence on Russian oil. Brent crude oil, a widely regarded measure of energy prices, rose to $108 per barrel, up about $4 from where it finished Friday.  Oanda Senior Market Analyst, UK & EMEA Craig Erlam noted bitcoin's choppiness over the past week after soaring past $47,000. ""It's recovered over the last few days after finding some support around $44,000 but continues to struggle to find much momentum as it approaches last week's peak,"" Erlam said. ""It could still build on that breakout but it may be more of a grind than we've seen in the past, given the current environment.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,581 +0.8%  DJIA: 34,921 +0.3%  Nasdaq: 14,532 +1.9%  Gold: $1,932 0.4%  Insights  Crypto offering a new opportunity for Indonesian investors  What’s the word for growth stock in Indonesian? Where can one find the equivalent of the Nasdaq in Jakarta?  That's a trick question. While Indonesia is home to many exciting startups, the stock exchange in Jakarta is a boring bourse. Over the past five years, the IDX80, an index of the top 80 companies on the Jakarta exchange, has fallen roughly 3%. In comparison, Taiwan’s TAIEX is up nearly 77% for the same time period and Korea’s KOSPI is up 25%.  These aren’t the kind of returns you’d want if you are a young Indonesian in the country’s new middle class looking to build wealth. It’s old news that Indonesians are deeply invested in crypto; there are more crypto investors in-country than retail stock traders. But new research published from the crypto exchange Gemini helps quantify just how deep their interest is.  According to Gemini’s findings, 41% of all Indonesians own crypto – spread evenly across the two genders at 49-51% for male and female. The country’s relatively high ownership rate makes it an outlier, as the report found that countries with higher income tend to have higher degrees of crypto ownership. By comparison, the U.K. has 40%, Germany 43%, and France 62%.  And this is all a new phenomenon. Globally, 41% of survey respondents purchased crypto for the first time in 2021.  Aside from the stock market not providing opportunities to build wealth, inflation is on everyone’s mind. Gemini’s survey showed that 64% of people in Indonesia believe it’s a hedge against inflation, and 61% of people believe that crypto is the future of money. By comparison, in most of western Europe, only 20-23% of people share this view. In the U.S., it’s at 23%.  Those that cover the PC and mobile phone industry will note that many in emerging markets skipped over PCs entirely because their first “personal computer” was their smartphone. Likewise, telecoms didn’t bother with widespread installations of copper phone lines. Instead, 3G towers went up followed by 4G in the mid-2010s giving the average person ample bandwidth.  Clearly, the same pattern is emerging in finance.     Technician's take  Bitcoin Weighed Down by $48K Resistance; Support at $43K  Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $46,000 on Monday, indicating a loss of upside momentum.  Price action was choppy over the weekend after buyers failed to approach the $48,000 resistance level. That points to continued price weakness, especially as momentum signals on the daily chart turned negative, similar to what occurred during the first week of February and March.  Support at $43,000 could stabilize the pullback, which is near the March 25 breakout level. Still, BTC will need to break above the 200-day moving average, currently at $48,286, in order to yield upside targets beyond the $50,966 resistance level.  For now, momentum signals remain positive on the weekly chart, which means downside could be limited.

42395680,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyUxZ,1649132253,"Can India’s Controversial New Tax Law Be Challenged in Court? Yes, Say Crypto Lawyers","India’s top legal experts say the crypto community would have a “fair chance” if they made a legal challenge to a 1% tax deducted at source enshrined in a new crypto tax law.  On Wednesday, the Indian government’s crypto tax legislation received the assent of the President of India, the final formality before becoming law.  The crypto tax law enforces a 30% tax on profits from crypto transactions, effective April 1. Traders will not be able to set off losses from other crypto transactions. Crypto gifts within a family would be exempt, but gifts above Rs. 50,000 ($660) outside the family would be taxable once in the hands of recipients.  The most controversial provision – the 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) liability – won’t take effect until July 1.  TDS is a liability enforced against the exchanges that deposit tax on behalf of sellers on the platform. It will be calculated at 1% of transaction value. The seller would be able to set off this 1% TDS from their total tax liability of 30%. The TDS mechanism is used to trace transactions and prevent tax evasion, according to the government.  Several crypto lawyers told CoinDesk they believed challenging the crypto tax legislation as a whole (both 30% tax on profits and 1% TDS) would be a “bad move.”  They struck a different tone when discussing a legal challenge to just the 1% TDS.  Legal precedent  Two law firms – Nishith Desai Associates and Ikigai Law – challenged a previous move by a government-adjacent institution.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the nation’s central bank, issued a circular that effectively prevented banks from providing services to crypto exchanges in 2018. The nation's Supreme Court struck down the RBI circular in March 2020, in a clear victory for the crypto community.  In the RBI case, Nishith Desai Associates represented the Internet and Mobile Association of India, an industry body that manages policy on behalf of crypto businesses collectively. Its lawyers declined to comment on the pros and cons of a legal challenge to the new crypto tax law.  Ikigai Law was the firm that represented crypto exchanges in the RBI case. Its founder and managing partner, Anirudh Rastogi, told CoinDesk he believed “there was a good case to be made” against the new crypto tax law.  “Approaching the courts might just be the only recourse … especially regarding TDS, more than the tax rate itself. The TDS rate and provision is arbitrary and will severely impact operations. On the TDS, I do believe there is a solid case to be made and that’s something we have looked at,” Rastogi said.  The Goa-based lawyer confirmed that his firm had explored approaching the Supreme Court to challenge the 1% TDS provision in the new crypto tax law but said no one from the crypto industry had approached him.  ""The 1% TDS is going to suck out liquidity from the system entirely, which means exchanges can't really operate. It also doesn't serve the government's objective of essentially increasing the tax base,” Rastogi said.  The provisions may be challenged for violating the fundamental right enshrined in the constitution of the Right To Trade or Article 19(1)(g) which states that “All citizens shall have the right to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business,” he said.  Both Rastogi and representatives of Nishith Desai Associates did not comment on the possibility of a legal challenge to the 30% tax on profits.  Other legal opinions  Rashmi Deshpande, an independent lawyer with a history of crypto related cases believes the legal strategy to approach the Supreme Court is critical.  “If you strictly talk about legal precedence and principles, this (challenging all crypto taxes as a whole) is not a good case to be challenged in the Supreme Court. Right now, crypto businesses should keep dialogue open with the government. Only dialogue can soften the government’s strict stand,” Deshpande said.  However, challenging the 1% TDS specifically is a different ball game altogether.  She said “the 1% TDS can be challenged as an inefficient mechanism to recover tax.”  Rajat Mittal, a tax counsel in India's Supreme Court advising crypto businesses, said “the Supreme Court is unlikely to interfere in a challenge to imposition of the 30% tax since the government’s policy decisions are not subject to judicial review.”  He believed whatever legal challenge is posed should be to the High Courts (which are the highest appellate courts in India), particularly the TDS provision.  “TDS can be challenged since it will be fatal to the existence of centralized exchanges, as users will migrate to other non-KYC [know your client] exchanges which would be termed differential treatment,” he said.  For Mittal, the grounds to challenge the 1% TDS rule could be that it “literally puts exchanges out of business."" He cited the same provision of the Indian constitution as Rastogi, saying that it gives freedom to trade and on the grounds of violating Article 14 that provides for equal treatment “since Indian exchanges will lose out to non-KYC and foreign exchanges that customers will prefer because of the 1% TDS.”  Vijayendra Pratap Singh, partner at AZB & Partners, a prominent firm on financial matters, said tax laws cannot be stayed by interim orders without special circumstances.  “If one cannot stay the law, the same will be enforced. Hence, people will have to start paying the taxes and settling the trades after deducting tax at source,” Singh said.  Crypto community exploring legal recourse  CoinDesk earlier reported that several industry leaders who did not wish to be named said the option of challenging the 1% TDS provision and the 30% tax on profits in the Supreme Court had been discussed.  “If such an option exists, it is the last nuclear approach,” Nischal Shetty of WazirX, India’s biggest exchange by volume, previously told CoinDesk.  An industry insider who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private said that exchanges are waiting for the industry body, the Internet & Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), to make a decision on a legal challenge to the tax law.  So far, India’s crypto community and the industry have expressed outrage, but concrete reactions to the crypto tax law are awaited.  Online campaigns titled #ReduceCyptoTaxes and #UnfairCryptoTax have been dominating the crypto conversation on social media. Opposition members of Parliament who have slammed the government for its policy with speeches in Parliament have been celebrated.  Predictions about an accentuated exodus of the crypto industry have declared that “India will see the biggest brain drain in history in the next eight to 12 months” because the new rules “wrap the industry in shackles'' resulting in ”potential entrepreneurs” moving “out of the country,” said Sidharth Sogani, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency research organization Crebaco.  WazirX’s Shetty had told CoinDesk that it would take at least a month to see the true impact of the crypto taxes.  ‘Wait for indirect taxes’  Apart from waiting to see the true impact of these taxes on the industry, legal exports believe crypto businesses should wait for indirect or GST (Goods and Services Tax) rates to be announced.  GST is an indirect tax that replaced many other indirect taxes in India, such as the excise duty, value-added tax, services tax and others, in 2017.  While direct tax proposals become law through Parliament, India has a different rule-making process for indirect taxes. Such tax legislation is made by the GST council, which follows the ideals of federalism in which different states and the central government frame policies together. The council consists of finance ministers from the central government and all states.  Reports suggest that the GST authorities are in the process of framing crypto tax policies and are of the opinion that crypto should be taxed at 28%, the highest tax slab meant for luxury goods, such as luxury cars, or speculative activities, including betting, gambling or horse racing.  Deshpande believes the industry “should patiently wait for GST rates to be announced and then rethink the litigation strategy.”  “There is no point filing a writ petition in the Supreme Court that may agitate the GST council to the extent that they charge you the highest rate of 28%,” she said.  AZB’s Singh also believed that “since 11 exchanges have faced tax inspections recently, it shows increased attention from tax authorities for any evasion.”  “Hence, the writing is on the wall of what could happen is increased focus on tax compliance. Therefore, it would be prudent to come up with a legal strategy which looks at compliance alongside the challenge,” he said.
