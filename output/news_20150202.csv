42398211,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSna1,1422907234,Video: Andreas Antonopoulos Talks 'Mastering Bitcoin',"Andreas Antonopoulos has long been one of the more well-respected names in the bitcoin and wider digital currency ecosystem.  Aside from winning the title of CoinDesk's 'Most Influential Person in Bitcoin' in 2015, Antonopoulos has served as a guiding voice for those in the bitcoin community and industry, holding positions at bitcoin startups such as Blockchain and CoinSimple.  In this video, I interview Antonopoulos about a range of subjects, from his new book Mastering Bitcoin to why he still thinks a hands-on approach is the best way to expand the digital currency's popularity.  View the full video interview below:  This video was produced by ZapChain.

42398219,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSnht,1422903633,'Bitcoin Elite' to Gather on Secret Island for Bilderberg-Style Retreat,"Satoshi Roundtable  , to be held from 6th to 8th February, is suggestive of the famed Bilderberg conference, the annual meeting at which more than 100 finance experts gather in relative secret to the delight of global conspiracy theorists.  Organized by Bruce Fenton of the Bitcoin Association and Atlantic Financial, participants in the first annual Satoshi Roundtable include top executives from companies such as Blockchain, BitGo, BitPesa, Chain, ChangeTip, Coinapult and MegaBigPower, as well as noted VCs in the space such as Erik Voorhees and Roger Ver.  The event is openly exclusive, and as such, its official website cautions that only 50 members of the ecosystem will attend.  The website reads:  “Even if you are a great person with many accomplishments in bitcoin and lots of passion we just won’t likely be able to invite you.”  Speaking to CoinDesk, Fenton discussed the big-picture goals of the event, indicating that he strives to strike ""the right balance of transparency and privacy"" by being open about it to the press, even if details about what transpires there may be scarce.  ""Attendees will have the option to have comments from speeches or interaction be publicly available. I personally plan to release everything I say and anyone else can do the same, I'll also work to protect the privacy of those who want it,"" he stated.  Event structure  Fenton elaborated on the nature of the event as well, talking generally about structure and noting that it intends to be a ""gathering of equals"" with only some set speakers.  ""The event is designed to foster relationships, interaction, tech development, deal making and provide a fun and relaxed but intensive environment to dive deeply into the technology and issues surrounding it,"" Fenton said.  Organizers indicated that Satoshi Roundtable has registration costs, but that they expect to only make a small profit from the event.  ""The primary goal is to support a successful event, not profit from it. [...] The funds are used to cover logistics, every attendee has all meals, drinks, snacks and entertainment included as well as other activities and some event costs as well as the logistics work my team does to make the event work,"" Fenton added.  Content unknown  While open about the event conceptually, Fenton revealed more information online, taking to Bitcoin Talk to advertise the event and the availability of a waiting list for interested attendees should any current participants cancel.  In a post, Fenton described the event as a “private dinner”, one in which participants will be able to “speak more freely” about the pressing issues facing the bitcoin space.  Fenton went on to talk about the challenges faced by those in the bitcoin ecosystem in this regard with more concrete examples.  “Many CEOs will not criticise regulators in a public event because they fear reprisals from the regulators. Another example is that some CEOs fear to attack known scams in public because they don't want attacks from scammers or to be associated with them (even as a critic) in the newspaper,” he wrote.  Fenton cited the need for open and honest dialogue on such subjects as one of the reasons it is closed to the public and the press.  Dominican Republic likely venue  Though the event website lists the event as taking place on a “Caribbean island”, its official GitHub page is more specific about the location, naming Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, as the formal site of the gathering.  A reverse image search of a photo listed on the official event site has revealed a potential location of the meeting, identifying the hotel in the photograph as the Club Med Punta Cana. The photo is also saved on the site as ""satoshi-location"".  Fenton did not confirm or deny this was the venue, stating only that his organization is ""not publicly releasing the location"" as it is not open to the press or public.  Hotel representatives were unable to confirm the event, stating only that the hotel is currently booked several months in advance.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.  Correction: A previous version of this article indicated Pantera's Steve Waterhouse would be attending. CoinDesk has since learned he will not be present at the event.

42398209,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSnY3,1422888972,Markets Weekly: Bitcoin Price Drops as Coinbase Euphoria Wanes,"The bitcoin price has fallen 11% over the last seven days, opening at $254.51 on 26th January and closing at $226.40 on 1st February, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  The price spiked at the start of the week, however, when it hit a high of $307.97 on the back of major announcements from Coinbase, which included its record-setting $75m funding round and the launch of its US-based exchange. The price jumped by more than $50 in intra-day trading.  Price gains were quickly lost again as successive trading sessions took their toll. The biggest dip occurred on Wednesday, as the price fell by about $30. By Saturday, a bitcoin was trading at $216.  A gain would come on Sunday, as the week closed, taking the bitcoin price to as high as $231.92, but closing at the $226 mark. This closed a trading week book-ended by significant gains that were ultimately outweighed by losses.  Regulations and exchanges in spotlight  Even as the initial bullish sentiment around the announcement of Coinbase's new exchange wore off, the launch left a trail of questions in its wake.  State regulators in California and New York both made statements refuting initial reports that Coinbase's exchange had been licensed to operate there. The firm responded, saying that it was operating in a regulatory ""grey zone"" that allowed it to take customers from those states.  The district attorney of Manhattan meanwhile told a gathering of anti-money laundering specialists that he was watching efforts to take bitcoin ""mainstream"" like the Coinbase exchange with ""intense interest"". Cyrus R Vance Jr said regulated exchanges benefited law enforcement efforts to police terror and financial crime.  Other exchanges seemed intent to re-double their efforts for market-share. Hong Kong-based ANX acquired CoinMKT in a bid to expand in the US market. Japan's BitFlyer raised a third round of financing as it planned to expand overseas, hinting at the possibility of a Singapore outpost.  In the UK, the team behind an authorised e-money issuer has launched an exchange called DSX linked to that entity, creating a level of scrutiny over the fiat funds that must flow through the issuer before entering the exchange.  Troubles for miners, meanwhile, continued apace. It was revealed that CoinTerra has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, amidst a rash of complaints made by customers of the firm made with the Federal Trade Commission that were published after a Freedom of Information request made by CoinDesk.  Volume rose significantly  Exchanges recorded a healthy increase in volume over the week, with 5.34 million coins changing hands between 25th and 21st January, according to data from Bitcoinity. This represented an increase of 33% over the previous seven-day period.  The major US dollar exchanges, Bitfinex and Bitstamp, recorded significant volume increases, with Bitfinex showing a 71% rise in volume and Bitstamp showing volume growth of 62% for the period.  A note about data: Volume data for ANX has been excluded from weekly volume aggregation because Bitcoinity has over-counted the exchange's total volume in its aggregation function. ANX uses a ""blended"" order book that shows total volume traded across all currency pairs, according to Jess Chan of ANX.  Bitcoinity summed this data for each currency pair, causing ANX's total volume to be over-stated. This issue was first raised last week by Kraken's Brian Bowman.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/02/markets-weekly-bitcoin-price-drops-as-coinbase-euphoria-wanes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ece9bab1cc17407a712465d995830cb9191ebe9b-900x500.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398220,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSnis,1422885761,Bonafide Raises $850k to Build Reputation System for Bitcoin,"A startup called Bonafide has raised $850,000 to build a reputation system for the bitcoin industry.  The funding round, which comes from Quest Venture Partners, Crypto Currency Partners and the AngelList Bitcoin Syndicate, among others, is a step towards creating a scoring system for addresses on bitcoin’s network.  Notably, Bonfide.io was included in Silicon Valley’s 500 Startups incubation program last year.  Brian Moyer, the firm's co-founder, said that 500 Startups venture partner Sean Percival saw early on the potential for Bonafide to create more credibility in bitcoin commerce, whether between consumers and merchants, or in person-to-person payments.  Moyer said:  “What we’ve found is that people need to identify with something, whether it’s a person or an entity in the bitcoin ecosystem. People need to be able to see what’s out there.”  Managing reputation  Following a spate of collapsed companies and notable frauds in the space, reputation in bitcoin is now seen as increasingly important in helping the technology to go more mainstream and overcome fears over the digital currency's pseudonymous nature.  While bitcoin addresses can in some cases be tracked and identified with certain persons or firms, generally it is hard to find out who owns a particular address.  So, for merchants and consumers in the bitcoin space, not having solid information about the person or entity they are dealing with can be a problem – an issue Bonafide aims to solve.  Moyer said:  “Bitcoin is desperately in need of having that place for people to be able to demonstrate their validity in the space.""  Bonafide does not have a login on its website. Instead, it culls information from social networks and the bitcoin network in order to provide entities, which could be people or organizations, a reputation score.  The company offers an API feed with reputation data that can be used by bitcoin companies, including wallets, exchanges and consumer-facing services.  The long-term hope for Bonafide is that the bitcoin industry as a whole will see so many transactions coming and going from different sources that an independent system will be needed as a source for reputation scoring.  Moyer said:  “In the end, identities are going to be the only commonality.”  Providing peace of mind  Identity may also help merchants feel more comfortable about accepting bitcoin if they know there is a scoring system based on who is transacting.  Moyer, who started his career doing signals intelligence for the army and later for the NSA, used cash as an analogy for the way bitcoin is right now pretty much anonymous.  He said:  “You know if I bring you a million dollars of cash there is something wrong. The reason is, you have no way of knowing where that money comes from.”  Merchants and other operators in the bitcoin industry are experiencing this issue of having little clue where bitcoin transactions come from. Companies like Bonafide and other identity and reputation systems are looking to alleviate this pain point.  Joe Peters, chief product officer at Bonafide, pointed to open-source identity protocol Onename as a similar product that could also be complementary to Bonafide's service.  “[Onename] is an incredible project. We would love to integrate, so our users can sign in using their Onename account,” he said.  Bonafide plans to launch in open beta in the next month or so.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/02/bonafide-raises-850k-to-build-reputation-system-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb43a8fe13e2c9874a20a4181e5a21eac11e408a-2068x1368.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42398189,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSlfx,1422873081,Spondoolies-Tech and Genesis Team Up for Cloud Mining Service,"Bitcoin mining hardware firm Spondoolies-Tech is partnering with Bermuda-based Genesis Mining on a new cloud mining offering.  According to the two companies, Spondoolies will provide the hardware to back the virtual contracts sold, while Genesis will operate the machines out of their existing data centers. New hardware shipments from Spondoolies’ facilities for the cloud mining service will be conditional on demand from customers.  The demand-driven model is one both Spondoolies CEO Guy Corem and Genesis CEO Marco Streng predict will be successful despite a challenging environment for the mining sector. Other companies, including BitFury, are also investing in new cloud offerings regardless of recent problems in the market.  Both expressed positivity about the initiative, and detailed how the firms have been searching for ways to work together since the summer of last year.  “We’ve looked for a way to do a deeper partnership on several levels,” Corem told CoinDesk, suggesting that the cloud offering is the first step in what will likely become a stronger link between the two companies.  Corem continued:  “There was a huge demand for our customers to offer a cloud mining option as well, especially now that maintenance fees, electricity costs are becoming a very dominant part of the mining cost. So, we wanted to do a soft launch, to check it out and see.”  Hardware-backed solution  According to Corem, Spondoolies will ship equipment to Genesis-run facilities to meet contract demand, with Genesis using existing hardware to cover hash-rate needs during the shipping period. He explained that the model is an evolution of a previously offered service by which the company hosted hardware at its Israel-based facility, but that rising energy costs have required a shift in strategy.  Corem characterized the cloud offering as “a new product” tied directly to demand from customers, rather than relying on a model that involves the operation of a bitcoin mining facility and the sale of contracts tied to that mine’s performance, or the use of third-party mines that produce hashing power.  “Our motto and guiding [principle] is to not compete with our customers,"" he said.  Strengthening ties  Streng explained how the partnership grew out of an existing relationship between the two companies, and noted that the cloud project was a natural fit for the two firms.  ""We are really happy to support and to do this joint project together with Spondoolies,"" he told CoinDesk.  Streng added that the partnership is important, given the environment for businesses in the mining space and the prevalence of fraudulent or disingenuous firms offering similar services.  Corem echoed this sentiment, saying that a mutual respect exists between the two companies that gave rise to the partnership today.  “We respect Genesis Mining, we understand their business, and I even consider the three founders friends,"" he said. ""So I know that we are in a very good partnership.”  Images via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/02/spondoolies-tech-and-genesis-team-up-for-cloud-mining-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5861e57a6f99ce53b0f5b739b681fcc97478fec2-1600x500.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
