42383160,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uIuJ,1578520251,Crypto Trading Privacy Gets a Boost as $15M of Tether Moves to Liquid Sidechain,"Stronger privacy is coming to the largest stablecoin, tether, with a recent blockchain-to-blockchain swap of $15 million worth of tokens.      At 11:27 UTC on Jan. 7, stablecoin issuer Tether conducted a cross-chain swap of some 15 million USDT reserves from ethereum to Blockstream’s Liquid, a federated sidechain running parallel to the bitcoin blockchain. The technical possibility of USDT’s Liquid debut was first announced in July 2019.      Innocuous at first glance, the transfer has implications for both digital asset trading and the larger tether market, which saw a mass migration from Omni, a bitcoin-based protocol, to ethereum and even Tron over the course of 2019.      But what Liquid offers is privacy.      Through confidential assets – a privacy tool which blinds asset values on public ledgers via a protocol called “confidential transactions” – these tether may never see public light again. In fact, it may be the first instance of private digital asset trading at scale.      By hiding tether transfers between off-exchange accounts on Liquid and exchanges themselves, traders can move assets around “without worrying about frontrunning,” pseudonymous Blockstream community manager Grubles told CoinDesk via Telegram.      For example, a trader could move some Liquid-based tether to an exchange, with the intent of buying bitcoin without tipping her hand to others who might drive the price up before she can make the purchase.      “Movements of tether can be tracked in general but also particularly to and from exchanges, which is valuable information. People absolutely trade based on this information,” Grubles said. “Moving from a blockchain that has transparent transactions and onto Liquid is somewhat of a no-brainer in the context of trading.”      Tether maintains a healthy competitive advantage against other stablecoins with nearly 75 times the daily trading volume of the next leading stablecoin, the Paxos Standard (PAX), according to Messari’s Stablecoin Index. Noting its ubiquitous use today by traders, Grubles said a pairing with privacy tech only adds to tether’s competitive edge.      Moreover, tether on Liquid may be the first instance of a semi-private stablecoin, according to Blockstream CSO Samson Mow.      “Services like Whale Alert, that track movements of assets, would not work for confidential assets in Liquid,” Mow told CoinDesk.      However, the number of tether tokens issued on Liquid remains public via the Blockstream block explorer, said Grubles, potentially assuaging some of the concerns of Tether skeptics. The stablecoin issuer and its sister company, Bitfinex, are currently under investigation by the New York Attorney General’s Office for allegedly commingling corporate and customer funds.    Shielded tethers    Confidential assets (CAs) were first formally proposed by Blocksteam employees in an April 2017 academic paper penned by bitcoin researchers Andrew Poelstra, Adam Back, Mark Friedenbach, Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille.      As described in the paper, the researchers used Pedersen commitments, a mathematical function capable of shielding input information while proving its overall validity, to “blind the amounts of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs, the term for individual blockchain values).”      Through CAs, coins can be both hidden from prying eyes and proven to still exist. Customer demand drove the decision to convert $15 million worth of tether from ethereum to the Liquid version, Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino told CoinDesk.      “With Confidential Transactions you can’t see the amounts being sent from one party to another,” said Mow. “That means that USDT issued in the Liquid Network provides better privacy than USDT on other chains.”    Tether’s blockchain hop    As a vehicle for crypto trading and price volatility protection, it’s likely more USDT will be minted on Liquid given the advantages. And, it's not like Tether hasn’t played nomad before.      “We may be witnessing the beginning of another Tether migration from ERC20 to Liquid,” said Tales from the Crypt podcast host Marty Bent in a blog post Tuesday. (ERC20 is the standard Tether has used to create tokens on top of ethereum.)      Launched as RealCoin in July 2014, tether is currently issued on multiple blockchains, the largest of which are ethereum, Omni and Tron. As data provider CoinMetrics shows, Tether kicked issuance onto the ethereum blockchain into high gear in April 2019, rising from $60 million to $400 million in a mere four weeks.      Eight months later and a flippening of sorts occurred, with tether issuance on ethereum overtaking Omni earlier this winter. At press time, some $2.3 billion tether was issued on ethereum compared to $1.5 billion on Omni.      While $15 million may be a far cry from $60 million, let alone $1.5 billion or $2.3 billion, Tether’s last year with ethereum demonstrates how fast the tide can shift.      “The impetus for the transition away from Omni to an ERC20 standard is, from what I understand, because their wallet support is [subpar]. What ethereum has done really well to date is make it really easy for services to spin up a wallet and accept random tokens,” Bent wrote. “One thing the transition to an ERC20 standard hasn't solved for Tether users is the Whale Alert problem.”",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING | USDT,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/08/crypto-trading-privacy-gets-a-boost-as-15m-of-tether-moves-to-liquid-sidechain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c72a7d7906fb5fbc62478d497a1a0b6acf914bb5-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383153,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uIml,1578512423,Vulture Investor Is Looking to Buy QuadrigaCX Creditors' Claims,"A New York investment firm wants to buy claims from former QuadrigaCX users – provided there's enough interest from creditors entitled to assets held by the infamous exchange.      Argo Partners is opening a dialogue with creditors of QuadrigaCX, which collapsed nearly a year ago following the death of its founder and CEO Gerald Cotten, in hopes of gauging how many individuals will sell stakes in its remaining funds.      Creditors who don’t want to wait for court-appointed bankruptcy trustee Ernst & Young (EY) to sort through the claims and liquidate assets can potentially sell their rights and cash out early, Zeeshan Aziz, who co-manages Argo’s trading desk, told CoinDesk.      Argo has a team dedicated to buying claims against companies which file for bankruptcy, he said.      Aziz noted that Quadriga is still early in its unwinding, and there are a number of challenges that his company will have to sort through. It doesn’t know how many creditors have made claims, how large these claims are or even what the actual return might be.      “Typically when Argo is buying claims – as an example Toys ’R’ Us – all creditors we would buy claims from, their information is public,” he said. “Toys ‘R’ Us tells us exactly who they owe money to and how much they owe.”      Argo, which put up a page indicating its interest in Quadriga claims last year, is no stranger to the crypto space. The company also sought to purchase claims from Mt Gox creditors.      Aziz wants to educate Quadriga’s creditors about its process and create a market for claims.      Regardless of how many claims it can gather, Argo would have to spend the same amount of resources in following the case and ensuring a return, so it hopes to acquire a large volume rather than a few small claims.    Liquidations    The two largest unknowns are the total number of creditors and how much they will receive from Quadriga.      EY has been investigating QuadrigaCX’s finances since it was first appointed by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court as a monitor to the exchange, finding the exchange has roughly $28 million CAD ($21 million USD) in assets. The firm has not yet revealed the number of claims it has received from creditors.      The auditor reported that Cotten used corporate and client funds for personal acquisitions, including several properties and luxury vehicles. These properties were passed to Cotten’s widow, Jennifer Robertson, as part of his estate.      In 2019, Robertson agreed to liquidate a majority of these properties, which EY estimated would raise $12 million CAD ($9 million USD). A tenant of one such property told CoinDesk via email last month that Open Door Property Management had been retained by EY to sell off the facilities.      While posts on Reddit expressed concern that tenants might be evicted following the sales, Open Door told CoinDesk that under Nova Scotia law at least, the new owners would have to provide a minimum 60-day notice period.      It does not appear that the properties have been sold yet, and Aziz said the real estate is likely to move slowly.      Upside splits    It is also unclear how much the creditors may receive from Quadriga’s supposed crypto holdings, said Jonathan Maruri, who co-manages Argo’s trading team. While Robertson reported that Quadriga held more than $180 million CAD worth of crypto at the time of the exchange's collapse, EY’s investigation indicates that most of this is gone, with some assets held at other exchanges or by third-party payment vendors.      Trying to recover the lost cryptos might end up eating into the cash on hand, Maruri said.      “Do they [EY] offset the cost of finding them? That's a pretty hard question for us to answer. Because this stuff is new, there's not a lot of crypto bankruptcies … We've got a collective 100-plus years of experience analyzing bankruptcies and no one knows [how to approach this],” he said.      Aziz said he is not willing to disclose how much Argo might pay for a claim at this time, but Argo would pay each creditor some small percent in an up front purchase.      Should more funds be returned to creditors – and subsequently paid out to the stakeholders – Aziz said a proportion would be split with the creditors in addition to the upfront payment.      Creditors would benefit either way, Aziz said, as they would be able to stop following the case but would still be eligible for a larger payout.      But, Aziz noted, any claims Argo purchases would be heavily discounted compared to what creditors might be eligible for when EY concludes its unwinding of the exchange.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/08/vulture-investor-is-looking-to-buy-quadrigacx-creditors-claims,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/857fdf702644a5180f5ece6ff5a28883bd6eef16-1500x888.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an interview Wednesday with French business magazine, Challenges, Lagarde reiterated the ECB wants to play an active role in cryptocurrencies. As businesses and individuals make more cross-border payments round the clock, Lagarde said the bank would continue looking into ""the feasibility and merits of a CBDC.""      Lagarde, who previously said the ECB should be ""ahead of the curve"" when it comes to CBDCs, added the bank does not want to stand in the way of cryptocurrencies created outside its sphere. ""[T]he prospect of central bank initiatives should neither discourage nor crowd out private market-led solutions for fast and efficient retail payments in the euro area,"" she said.      CBDCs may have significant implications for the bloc's financial sector and changes in monetary policy going forward, Lagarde said. The ECB formed a cryptocurrency task force last month that would work closely with eurozone central banks to understand the benefits and costs of a possible eurozone CBDC.      Global interest in CBDCs came soon after the unveiling of Facebook's Libra in the summer. Although the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has been working on its ""digital yuan"" for years, officials only started divulging information on it late last summer, reportedly concerned private initiatives could take market share before the government currency launched.      In addition, CBDCs may provide citizens with a means of exchange in the event ""physical cash eventually declines,"" possibly in tandem with private crypto initiatives.      Most central bankers have described the relationship between cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and fiat currencies as exclusive and adversarial. Outgoing Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said last year a multi-fiat-backed CBDC could well replace the U.S. dollar as the dominant global reserve currency. IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath argued cryptocurrencies, including CBDCs, lacked key infrastructure and global acceptance to successfully tackle the greenback.      Although Lagarde has said cryptocurrencies could address many of the problems with the legacy financial system, she said they might also present new risks to users. Last month, she expressed concern Facebook could use its digital platform to lock out rival stablecoin operators and thereby gain an unfair advantage.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/08/ecbs-lagarde-we-want-to-develop-digital-currencies-but-wont-discourage-private-initiatives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0a0318425376e66451f1528b6f1d0fdb346e273-1024x686.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383165,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uJ0b,1578503759,A Russian Nuclear Plant Is Renting Space to Energy-Hungry Bitcoin Miners,"UDOMLYA, Russia – A state-owned nuclear power plant in Russia may soon fuel a bitcoin mining hub.      Late last month, Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation opened a venue for a mining farm near the Kalinin nuclear plant in Udomlya, 200 miles northwest of Moscow. The company spent more than $4.8 million building the 30-megawatt facility, according to Sergei Nemchenkov, the head of data centers and digital products at Rosenergoatom, a Rosatom subsidiary.      Rosenergoatom isn’t planning to mine itself, Nemchenkov said. Rather, it will capitalize on the opportunity to sell additional electricity to heavy users and rent space for their equipment, similar to a data center the firm built near the plant.      ""Both data centers and miners are large energy consumers with a stable demand,"" Nemchenkov said. ""For us, it's a way to diversify.""      Rosatom is the first big government-related entity to embrace miners in Russia, the world's eleventh-largest economy, according to the IMF and the World Bank. And with plans to eventually open 240 megawatts or more of its power from several locations to the industry, the company could become a notable player on the global market.      To put that number in perspective, Chinese mining giant Bitmain's facility under construction in Rockdale, Texas, is expected to start with a capacity of 25 to 50 megawatts and eventually expand to 300 megawatts. Another facility being built in the same town would start at 300 MW and eventually go up to 1 gigawatt; both are claiming the title of world's largest.      The Kalinin plant (built in 1974 and named after a statesman who was the formal head of the Soviet state from 1919 until 1946) is another example of miners in Russia nesting close to old industrial sites, like the abandoned factories in Siberia that are attracting miners from all over the world.      In Udomlya, a rectangular field of about 215,000 square feet is expected to fit up to 30 containers, each with room for almost 400 individual mining computers.        Electricity for miners will cost 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt-hour – not the cheapest price you can find around the globe, as rates lower than 4 cents can be found in some regions of China and Kazakhstan.      But Rosenergoatom wants to market the project, first of all, as a legitimate, reputable way to mine cryptocurrency, right on the energy producer’s property.      “It’s a totally white deal,” Nemchenkov said.    Big ambitions    To find clients, Rosenergoatom partnered with ECOS-M, a mining hotel firm that serves as an intermediary between the venue and miners. Founded in 2017 in Armenia, ECOS-M started by building a mining venue near the country’s Hrazdan thermal power plant.       So far, ECOS-M has set up two containers in Hrazdan, but hopes to expand significantly as the potential capacity of the site is up to 200 megawatts, ECOS-M managing partner Ilya Goldberg said.      But the partnership with Rosenergoatom, which he says is “very comfortable” for ECOS-M, is even more promising.      If ECOS-M manages to fill the field in Udomlya fast, Rosenergoatom will open other venues for mining, said Nemchenkov.       “This is the company we’re planning to go a long way with,” he said.       According to the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by ECOS-M and Rosenergoatom in February, in addition to Udomlya, four more Rosatom venues might be filed with miners in the coming years, two of them in Siberia, one in the northern region of Murmansk and one in the Kaliningrad exclave in the West.       One of these venues, located in the Siberian town of Seversk, is an especially ambitious project, Nemchenkov said: With a potential capacity up to 200 megawatts, the site is expected to fit 84 containers for one megawatt each at the beginning, after construction is finished, tentatively scheduled for late 2021.       Some 130 more megawatts of available electricity are waiting for miners near the Kolskaya and Baltic nuclear power plants and Angarsk Electrolysis Chemical Plant, according to the MOU.    Backup plans    For Rosenergoatom, building mining venues for rent is a by-product of the company’s ambition to become a large data center provider.       The political situation is conducive to this business: in early December, Russia passed a law prohibiting storage of Russian citizens’ personal data abroad.       This means any company dealing with Russians’ personal data will have to store it on servers inside Russia or pay up to $290,000 in fines and get blocked in the country. Another law, passed in 2016, requires all telecom companies to store their clients’ communication data for up to three years, further stimulating demand for storage.      The data center in Udomlya has a backup diesel generator, which ensured uninterrupted service for clients during a brief outage at the Kalinin power station last year caused by a short circuit in a transformer outside the plant, Nemchenkov said.       While the mining field doesn’t have such generators, an outage there in extreme conditions would only last one or two minutes, he said.       Rosenergoatom seems serious about working with miners: According to Nemchenkov, there will be an option to hire the nuclear giant’s personnel to take care of the mining containers and leverage its engineering and industrial safety expertise. It might also provide the metal containers in the future, Nemchenkov said.       However, the infrastructure the company is building can serve various use cases, Nemchenkov said. If one day Russia bans crypto, or mining in particular, the venue can be upgraded and turned into a normal data center, he said.       “For the time being, we can host miners. If the mining story is over, we can host something else,” Nemchenkov said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/08/a-russian-nuclear-plant-is-renting-space-to-energy-hungry-bitcoin-miners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed0e763c62c709c5acbafc6f366daebf27d52124-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Levine, editor of Podcasts here at CoinDesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours.      NEWS ROUNDUP       Brad Keoun: Bitcoin’s price has hit a seven-week high of $8,463 during Asian hours after Iran launched missile attacks at two U.S. military bases in Iraq. So far, no casualties have been reported.      Trade is off a bit in the past several hours as Iran's foreign minister said it had concluded its attacks and that it did not seek an escalation of war. But markets were also keeping an eye on the crash of a Ukraine International Airlines flight that took off from Tehran early Wednesday, killing more than 170 people. Iranian news services have reported the crash was due to technical failure by the Boeing plane.      For crypto markets, investors are continuing to watch to see if bitcoin's correlation with gold, a typical safe-haven asset in times of geopolitical and economic turmoil, will continue to strengthen.      Adam: Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone writes in a Crypto Outlook report that bitcoin is ""winning the adoption race"" partly because of its store-of-value properties, at a time when the market environment favors independent quasi-currencies.      He predicts bitcoin prices could track upward with gold this year, potentially edging toward last year’s high around $14,000.      The first-born crypto is winning as it evolves into a digital version of gold, McGlone writes.      Brad: And in news on what could be the world’s biggest bitcoin mine, Whinstone’s planned $150 million facility in Rockdale, Texas, has reportedly signed up two Japanese corporate customers.      SBI Holdings and GMO have agreed to rent mining capacity at the facility, with operations set to start in the coming months, Bloomberg News reports.      CoinDesk reported in November that the bitcoin mine would have an initial power usage of 300 megawatts, expanding to 1 gigawatt, dwarfing a nearby facility built by Bitmain, the giant Chinese maker of bitcoin-mining computers.      Adam: Turning to regulatory news, a unit of the U.S. Securities and Exchange devoted to inspections and examinations has released its list of top priorities for 2020, and digital assets are ranked as an “area of concern.”      The SEC office says it wants to address the investment suitability of digital assets, along with trading practices, fund safety, pricing and the effectiveness of compliance programs.      The SEC office noted that the market for digital assets has grown rapidly, and might present risks for retail investors who don’t understand the differences between crypto and more traditional financial products.      Brad: And finally, crypto is coming to the courtroom.      CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker reports that the Swiss-based crypto project Aragon has started recruiting jurors ahead of its planned launch of a new decentralized court system.      Starting on Tuesday, participants in the Aragon project could exchange their ANT tokens for newly minted Aragon Network Juror Tokens that can then be used to sign up to serve as jurors in disputes adjudicated in Aragon’s courtroom.      Jurors who serve are eligible for rewards paid out in - you guessed it, more tokens.      FEATURE - Cars Paying Cars      Adam: Turning to today’s featured segment, we’re talking Sony, cars and crypto. The CoinDesk team has been in Las Vegas all week for the annual Consumer Electronics Show - better known as CES. Here’s what we know, according to CoinDesk Editor John Biggs.      There is a school of thought that believes the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain happens when robots begin paying robots. These robots might be cleaning our houses, taking care of our elders or driving us around. Cryptocurrency becomes the value transfer medium in this scenario and all of the sensors, computers and systems associated with washing our floors or getting us around connect to the worldwide internet of value and, in the end, supplant most payment methods.      Car manufacturers probably won't play ball. Car sales and car manufacturers depend on a few things, the primary one being that a human will buy an expensive hunk of steel and spend quite a while behind the wheel. Sony and Apple and Intel and countless mobility startups aren't harnessed to that antiquated notion. To them, cars are computers.      So, it did not go unnoticed when...      Sony announced a car – a real, physical vehicle with wheels and seats. Obviously, this car, called the Vision-S, is a prototype and you probably won't be going down to Best Buy to pick up some USB-C cables and a new Sony whip. But the simple fact remains that an electronics and software company is moving into real-world mobility.      The Sony car is packed with sensors – lidar, radar and cameras – and 360-degree audio with a huge, wraparound screen to entertain the driver. It is, in short, the beginning of a car-creation model that pulls the industry out of the 1900s and into the 2000s.      The electric vehicle is built on Sony's own platform, which it plans to use in multiple body configurations. It has a reported zero-to-60-mph time of 4.8 seconds, according to Car and Driver, and a max speed of 149 mph. It's a real car with real power.      We know very little about Sony's future car plans and the concept model is far from ready for the market. But eventually, this car and many like it will be communicating with each other wirelessly and negotiating traffic automatically. Your wallet will take a hit if you want to get somewhere faster — your car will pay another car to get ahead of them — and you'll spend or even earn if you can spare a few more minutes on the road. Roads themselves will request tolls for maintenance and, as we sit in relative comfort, we'll be making requests for applications, educational materials and entertainment. And, if Facebook, Apple and Amazon have their way, we won't be swiping a credit card.      All of this assumes Sony and Apple and Google and Amazon are all thinking the same thing. Thus far, it seems they are. They are computing companies. Computing is built on open standards, and anything traditional car manufacturers do to prevent that openness will earn them a spot outside of the network. The new driverless, self-negotiating cars will also face driver resistance. Maybe we'll have a future where petulant car lovers boast they are both ""rolling coal"" and ""rolling meat"" by driving their antiquated vehicles manufactured before, say, 2025. But anything that stands in front of the onslaught of driverless, constantly negotiating vehicles will be run over.      In the end, maybe this Sony car is a random pop on the future's horizon. Or maybe it's something else: the beginning of a firework show that will truly take this extremely nascent technology mainstream. All we can say right now is people are excited about what's to come.      SPOTLIGHT - Crypto Liquidity      Adam: And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re looking at the evolving concept of liquidity, in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency markets.       Brad: That’s right, Adam, today we want to highlight a really smart report out this week from our colleagues on the ColnDesk Research team, Noelle Acheson and Galen Moore, looking at liquidity in crypto markets.      Liquidity is one of those market terms that gets tossed around frequently by analysts, and crypto markets have idiosyncrasies that make liquidity an even more complicated subject than in traditional markets.      In this context, the authors looked at liquidity as a measure of, generally speaking, how easily a given crypto asset can be bought or sold in a reasonably large quantity without moving the price much.      Bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency and the largest by market value around $150 billion, is by far the most liquid, according to the authors, and most crypto investors can enter and exit a reasonably sized position with relative ease.      Yet, as we have often seen, a large order can whiplash the price.      One key issue is that these markets are quite fragmented, with a handful of large exchanges operating in several jurisdictions, alongside medium-size regional exchanges and hundreds of other niche exchanges geared toward specific types of traders.      That spreads trading volumes across a range of venues, diluting the liquidity.      The contrast is with traditional financial markets, where there tend to be fewer exchanges to choose from, so there’s less liquidity dilution.      A more diluted trading volume makes it harder to execute a large order without affecting the price.      To place a big order without moving the price, a client may need to use various exchanges, resulting in higher costs, and that could serve as a barrier for some investors from accumulating a large trading position.      A thriving over-the-counter, or OTC, market has sprung up to solve these problems, but there’s not an abundance of reliable data on how much volume these OTC desks account for.      Another key aspect of liquidity in crypto markets is the role of stablecoins, or digital assets like Tether whose price is pegged to government-issued currencies such as the U.S. dollar.      These stablecoins can be moved rapidly from exchange to exchange, allowing investors to reduce the balances they have to hold at individual exchanges, and thus reducing their cost of capital.      The authors conclude that the unusually fragmented structure of crypto markets thins order books, increasing the cost of trading by requiring traders to execute across a range of exchanges or by pushing large orders onto the OTC market.      But they make the point that crypto infrastructure is evolving rapidly to overcome liquidity obstacles.      Those could include market consolidation as well as the growing use of prime brokers, which cater to hedge funds with brokerage services and trading loans, as well as with enhanced data reporting and metrics analysis.      There’s also the possibility that simply the entry of more money into crypto markets might do the trick.      According to the report, more liquidity could come from greater mainstream interest in crypto assets, perhaps triggered by the upcoming “bitcoin halving” in May or by the emergence of liquid derivative markets for a broader range of investors.      This could bring fresh demand for cryptocurrencies, accelerate the compression of trading bid-offer spreads and trigger the introduction of further liquidity-enhancing measures.      What’s more, growing liquidity generally tends to reduce volatility, which in turn might lead to even more liquidity.

42383167,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uJ1r,1578502680,"10M Bitcoins Haven't Moved in More Than a Year, Highest Since 2017","“HODLing” has returned to a major milestone: The total number of bitcoins that haven’t changed hands in more than a year has crossed the 10 million mark.      About 10.7 million bitcoins haven’t moved in more than 12 months, according to Digital Assets Data, a fintech company building crypto data feeds.       Considering the total number of bitcoins in circulation is 18.14 million, this also means nearly 60 percent of the coins remained dormant and only 40 percent participated in the price action seen in 2019. The percentage of bitcoins lying dormant for over a year is at its highest level since early 2017.       “The sheer size of unmoved bitcoin is definitely a sign of the developing community of HODLers,” Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer at Komodo Platform, told CoinDesk.       The top cryptocurrency witnessed substantial swings last year, rising from $3,693 to $13,879 in the first six months only to fall back to $7,179 by mid-December. Thus, bitcoin just about doubled last year despite the brutal sell-off in the second half.       Even so, a large number of bitcoins remained inactive, possibly because investors are expecting a significant price rise following the mining reward halving, due in May. The process, repeated every four years, reduces block rewards by half in order to keep inflation under check.      However, if the market doesn’t live up to lofty expectations, some selling could be seen, Stadelmann said. In that case, the sum of bitcoins lying dormant would drop.       HODLers underwater    Another strong reason for the growing number of bitcoins lying dormant could be that a sizable portion of HODLers are doing so at a loss and are holding on to their investments.       “Many investors are potentially still underwater with bitcoin that was purchased at higher prices in 2017 and 2018,” said Kevin Kaltenbacher of Digital Assets Data.       Prices higher than the 2019 high of $13,879 were observed during the December 2017-February 2018 rally, and many investors may have acquired coins during that bull market frenzy.       However, the fact these investors have not sold indicates they are likely betting on long-term growth prospects.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/08/10m-bitcoins-havent-moved-in-more-than-a-year-highest-since-2017,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/794f932f4f4a5e66e1316f0becb30f9cc597d000-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383145,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uIhj,1578500276,"Bitcoin Price Will Be Golden in 2020 Thanks to Limited Supply, Increasing Use: Bloomberg Report","Increasing global uncertainties and a weak dollar will likely push more investors into bitcoin as it becomes recognized as a store of value. The cryptocurrency's fixed supply will further drive price increases throughout the year, Bloomberg analysts predict.      Bloomberg's 2020 crypto outlook report, published Monday, predicts bitcoin's price could move to the top of its 2019 range and retest the $14,000 high at a time when a weak dollar and stock market volatility continue and geopolitical tensions increase.      ""Bitcoin's initial reaction to the [Jan. 3] U.S. airstrike that killed one of Iran's most powerful generals was a good test of our premise that the first-born crypto is maturing toward a digital version of gold,"" reads the report. Bitcoin jumped to a seven-week high Wednesday as gold rallied to $1,600 for the first time since 2013.      Bitcoin has long been seen as ""digital gold,"" in part because it is a limited asset that cannot be easily increased to meet changing demand, much like the yellow metal. The halving event expected later this year will reduce block rewards from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC, further adding to supply pressures should demand continue to grow.      Bitcoin's supply is projected to grow by about 2.5 percent in 2020, which would be an all-time low. That's partly due to the halving of the block reward – from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC. Supply in 2021 could well fall below 2 percent, analysts say.      Increasing investment in bitcoin could take many forms, believe the analysts. The rapidly expanding derivatives market – a sign of integration into mainstream markets – will better enable institutional investors to gain exposure to the asset class. That could have knock-on effects on price and decreasing volatility, thereby reinforcing bitcoin's status as a store of value.      Not everyone is convinced bitcoin and gold share such a strong bond. Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, which specializes in cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange, called such a relationship ""weak"" and noted the correlation between the two assets was negative until recently.      Bitcoin has also been prone to periods of short, sharp volatility. The asset surged up above $10,000 after President Xi of China called for his country to accelerate its adoption of blockchain technology before retracing its former range weeks later. For some analysts, that volatility fundamentally undermines the case for bitcoin being a stable store of value, at least for the time being.      But while bitcoin may still be too volatile for many people's liking, it appears investors in the asset class are increasingly valuing digital assets that can maintain some sort of stable price. The Bloomberg report predicts that tether's market cap will likely continue expanding this year, with many alternative cryptocurrencies struggling to keep investors as supply outstrips demand.      ""Bitcoin should again outshine most crypto assets in 2020 as the unique and appreciating digital version of gold,"" the report continues. ""Bitcoin is winning the adoption race, notably as a store of value in an environment that favors independent quasi-currencies.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/08/bitcoin-price-will-be-golden-in-2020-thanks-to-limited-supply-increasing-use-bloomberg-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84fc0231cfddc39dcc50f2b3a3bc5d99d0827581-1024x376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383150,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uIkF,1578497100,Oman's Largest Port Joins Blockchain Shipping Platform TradeLens,"The largest port in the Middle Eastern nation of Oman has signed up withTradeLens – a blockchain supply chain platform founded by IBM and Maersk.      The Port of Salalah recently became a member of the shipping data project as part of its digital transformation efforts, according to a report in the Times of Oman on Wednesday.      The platform enables companies along the shipping supply chain to share data on cargoes in real time over its permissioned blockchain, ultimately aiming to bring improved transparency and efficiency to international trade. According to the Times, the port is working with other entities in the supply chain to digitize its operations and sees TradeLens as a way to bring a global transparency standard to shipping operations.      ""Adopting and incorporating blockchain technology into all aspects of the supply chain will not only enhance the attractiveness of Salalah for [ecosystem] companies but also support the development of new business models that can further leverage the geographical location of Salalah,” said Mark Hardiman, CEO of Port of Salalah.      Launched in 2018, the TradeLens project has seen some reluctance from shipping firms to sign up, partly due to the way the venture was set up to favor the founding companies. However, changes to its business structure have prompted a number of major carriers to come aboard in the last year.      The platform now has more than 100 participants – including five of the six largest container shipping firms as well as port operators and regulators – and is processing over “10 million discrete shipping events and thousands of documents each week,” according to previous statements from Maersk.      Last August, Thailand's customs agency was reported to be integrating with TradeLens to streamline its shipment tracking procedures.      The project also received an antitrust exemption from the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission. That arose to clear the project from legal restrictions in cooperation between shipping companies mandated by the U.S. Shipping Act of 1984.      The Port of Salalah recently broke its own record, handling yearly volume equivalent to four million shipping containers, according to the Times.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/08/omans-largest-port-joins-blockchain-shipping-platform-tradelens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/807679d6113a89d91a20fbf881021fd9915372f5-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The initial annual percentage yield on the assets will be 8.6 percent for USDC and 3.78 percent for litecoin.      In 2020, the company aims to add five to 10 new assets including USDC and LTC and is looking most aggressively at the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and U.S.-domiciled dollar-backed stablecoins, said Zac Prince, BlockFi’s CEO and founder. USDC is the largest of these stablecoins. The company already supported LTC as collateral for loans and approved of the currency’s liquidity, volatility and overall track record.      BlockFi also plans to develop a mobile app and the ability to send fiat wire transfers in the first quarter of this year. In Q2 2020, it will offer Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment capabilities and in the second half of the year BlockFi plans to launch a credit card that offers rewards in bitcoin.      “Most of the cards that exist now are debit cards or pre-paid cards … for prime consumers in the U.S., the vast majority of spending takes place on credit cards,” said Prince. “This will be a premium credit card that can pass back a bitcoin cashback rate that is attractive with traditional premium cards.”      Prince wouldn’t name the issuing bank for BlockFi’s credit card or which banks would be providing the ACH services, but the startup already works with Silicon Valley Bank, investment bank and brokerage Oppenheimer & Co, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank.      BlockFi has been providing fiat loans with bitcoin and ether collateral since the beginning of last year. In March, it launched its service offering to pay clients interest on their crypto, which it loaned out to institutions. The company has had to cut rates more than once because borrower supply has not been able to meet depositor demand.      At first, depositors received 6 percent monthly and 6.2 percent in compound interest yearly. In April, the company changed these rules for accounts with more than 25 bitcoin or 500 ether, saying they would get 6 percent monthly only on the part of their holdings below that threshold. In May, the maximum balance for which it will offer 6.2 percent annual interest dropped further to 250 ETH and, later on, to 5 BTC and 200 ETH.      In December, the company made the terms more favorable to users, applying the 6.2 percent rate only to holdings lower than 10 BTC, with everything above that earning 2.2 percent annually. For ether, deposits below 1,000 ETH earn 4.1 percent annually and everything above only 0.5 percent.",POSITIVE,ETH | LTC | USDC,BCH | ETH | FIAT | LTC | USDC,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/08/blockfi-adds-litecoin-usdc-to-its-lending-product-suite,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62456251a2ded787eb07573beb40201cf6a69876-2476x1670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383156,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uIrn,1578486600,Former Bakkt CEO to Help Oversee CFTC in Congress,"The former chief executive of bitcoin derivatives exchange Bakkt is to join the committee that oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), raising concerns of a possible conflict of interest.      The newly appointed senator, Kelly Loeffler (R., Ga.), will serve on the Senate Agricultural Committee, which is responsible for defining the CFTC's remit and approving nominations for commissioners and chairmen. It also includes reauthorizing the CFTC as a federal regulator.      Loeffler was appointed CEO of Bakkt when it launched under its parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in August 2018. Under her leadership, Bakkt received approval from the CFTC to begin trading physically-settled bitcoin contracts, finally opening to traders in September. Loeffler, who only resigned her position in December to go into politics, is also married to Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder, chairman, and chief executive of ICE.      Amid concerns her appointment would create a conflict of interest, Loeffler told the Wall Street Journal she had ""worked hard to comply with both the letter and the spirit of the Senate’s ethics rules and will continue to do so every day"".      “I will recuse myself if needed on a case by case basis,” she said.      Loeffler grew up on her family's farm in Illinois – a fact that's been emphasized in her marketing materials since Georgia Governor Brian Kemp first announced her appointment in December.      ICE is the second-largest exchange operator by market capitalization. The company's expansion into bitcoin last year came after the CME Group started offering its own cash-settled futures in December 2017. ICE's annual report said many of its exchanges were ""subject to extensive regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.""      According to regulatory filings, Sprecher has a 1.1 percent equity stake in ICE worth almost $600 million based on the current market price.      The CFTC has treated bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies as commodities since a ruling in 2015. More recently, it investigated allegations against crypto derivatives platform BitMEX and suggested U.S. regulated ether futures could launch sometime in 2020.      Regulatory concerns lay behind the nine-months delay to Bakkt's launch. Speaking to CoinDesk in April, Christopher Giancarlo, the CFTC's then-chairman, hinted about concerns surrounding the exchange's plan to self-custody bitcoin as well as clear trades through its parent company's clearinghouse.      At the time, Loeffler said the exchange would ""continue to work with regulators to address the emerging global landscape for digital assets.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/08/former-bakkt-ceo-to-help-oversee-cftc-in-congress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab2c5e59481b20b73b3458b70f5acd6913e25de6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383154,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uIpH,1578484800,Why China Is Banning Crypto but Is Bullish on Blockchain,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Flex Yang is co-founder and CEO of Babel Finance.      Babel Finance is one of China’s largest financial service providers.      The firm works with crypto mining companies to fund the volatile industry and products including crypto-backed loans, deposit services, margin trading and derivatives. Since July 2018, Babel has issued $400 million in crypto-backed loans with a balance of more than $300 million outstanding.      Before pivoting to crypto, Yang and his co-founder Del Wang worked in the world of microfinance. Yang’s first venture, Standard Financial Inclusion, provided financial services for the underbanked.      Speaking via email, Yang shared his views on the past year in crypto, President Xi’s ambition to “seize” the blockchain opportunity and what China's stablecoin (from its central bank, or PBoC) means for global finance. His responses have been lightly edited for clarity.      What have been the biggest events in the crypto industry in 2019? How will these events affect the industry going forward?      The two biggest events were connected: the Facebook-led Libra project and China’s pivot towards blockchain technology. These two events are connected in the sense of uncovering blockchain's relationship to currency development.      Libra drew the general public’s attention to crypto and blockchain technologies. President Xi’s address on the importance of blockchain technology pushed the government to speed up development of its fiat digital currency program, primarily due to the pressure of Libra on the renminbi (RMB). Both will have a long-term positive impact for the industry.      Although Libra will face lots of obstacles and President Xi’s announcement has brought more regulatory attention to crypto in the short term, I believe these two events will help attract more resources and people to the industry and eventually boost the market in the long term.      What were the most significant advances for crypto or blockchain technology in China in 2019?      Unfortunately, in 2019 I didn’t observe any significant advances in blockchain technology. On the other hand, I observed the advance in the government’s attitude towards blockchain technology, although the most significant impact will be on the RMB rather than cryptocurrencies.    China’s ambition is to bolster the RMB rather than blockchain technology itself.    Why did China set blockchain as a national priority?      In my opinion, China’s ambition is to bolster the RMB rather than blockchain technology itself. The key driver of setting this national priority is the unsuccessful RMB globalization strategy and the competitive pressure of Libra, which is regarded as a U.S. program by many in China. So the government is seeking a way to make the RMB stronger and more acceptable globally.      Do you suppose crypto companies that left in 2017 or earlier will return to China?      The regulation of crypto businesses in China after President Xi’s statements actually intensified. There is an old saying in China, “The bandit needs to be wiped out before the regular army gets in.” I think companies that left China won’t return until the regulatory environment becomes clearer. This is hardly possible in the short term. Instead, the government is promoting adoption and application of blockchain technology in industries such as in supply chain management, source tracking in the food industry and so on. It has nothing to do with cryptocurrency.      What do you think of the PBoC's digital replacement for cash? How do you envision the rollout happening?      PBoC’s effort on creating a digital replacement for cash is the very first step in bringing the RMB to global trade, but its target is not to replace the current digital payment system in China. It will be rolled out under pressure from Libra and other governments’ fiat digital currencies. But I think it will take a pretty long time for real implementation in China.      How has the crypto mining industry in China evolved over the past year?      It was a dramatic year for miners in China, which can be divided into three periods:      In Q1, we experienced a very inactive market. Most miners were very pessimistic, but some institutional players joined and brought new energy.      From Q2 to Q3, the mining industry was growing very fast due to the surge in bitcoin’s price. But the good days didn’t last long after the big price drop at the end of Q3 and the crazy growth of the hash rate. Lots of miners who bought mining machine futures that were set to be delivered in Q4 and the first quarter of 2020 experienced major losses.      Q4 was a bloody period for the mining industry. Manufacturers began selling at discounted prices. They also worked with crypto financial institutions (like Babel) to try to offload inventories in preparation for the new-generation miners in 2020, when I anticipate that more institutional players will come into the market.      Overall, the field has changed a lot and some new pools grew quickly. Miners are quite divided in attitude towards the coming bitcoin reward halving and we need to wait for the halving before we can give a conclusion.      Is there any effect on the crypto industry by the ongoing trade war?      The China-U.S. trade war was one of the key drivers of BTC surge during May to June 2019, but since September bitcoin is no longer the “safe haven” assets for investors worrying about the trade war after market moving favor to other categories of assets.      But when we dive deeper, it is noted that the fundamental conflict of the trade war between China and US is the currency competition. Therefore, I think the ongoing trade war has a long-term impact on the crypto industry by dragging China’s state-owned resources and corporations into this industry.      Other thoughts on the industry?      I'm still positive about bitcoin in the long term, and wish everyone would HODL. On the other hand, the crypto industry is at its very early stage, there will be lots of developments out of our expectations, just like the internet in 1980s. Let’s give it time and see.

42431375,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN23Ph,1578481200,Bitcoin May Follow Gold With Significant Price Breakout,"View    Bitcoin hit seven-week highs during the Asian trading hours and could extend the rally to a key Fibonacci hurdle above $8,600.  A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $7,960 looks likely and would confirm a falling channel breakout on the weekly chart and signal a revival of the bull run from lows near $4,100 seen in April 2019.  Gold witnessed a channel breakout at the end of December and has rallied by more than $100 ever since.  Acceptance below $8,000 would weaken the odds of channel breakout this week.    Bitcoin jumped to seven-week highs early on Wednesday and appears on track to confirm a significant price breakout similar to that seen by gold.      According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the number one cryptocurrency by market value rose to $8,463 – the highest level since Nov. 18 – during the Asian trading hours as Iran launched retaliatory attacks on the American bases in Iraq.      While bitcoin rallied to multi-week highs, gold, a classic haven asset, jumped above $1,600 for the first time since 2013. Other anti-risk assets like Japanese yen, Swiss franc and U.S. bonds also drew bids.      The safe-haven narrative surrounding bitcoin has strengthened with the cryptocurrency gaining ground in tandem with gold since Friday.      The yellow metal found takers near $1,530 on Friday after the U.S. killed a top Iranian military commander and rose to a high of $1,611 earlier today. Meanwhile, bitcoin turned higher from lows near $6,850 on Friday and has gained more than 20 percent since.      The cryptocurrency now looks set to take a page out of gold’s book and confirm a falling channel breakout on the weekly chart.    Bitcoin and gold weekly charts    As can be seen, both assets had a tough time in the second half of 2019.      Gold (above right) topped out at $1,557 at the end of August and fell to lows below $1,450 in November, creating a falling channel on the weekly chart. The channel was breached on the higher side in the last week of December with a convincing move above $1,483. The breakout signaled a resumption of the rally from lows near $1,270 seen in April and since then, the yellow metal has rallied by more than 8 percent.      Bitcoin’s weekly chart (above left) also shows a falling channel, which represents the sell-off from the June 2019 high of $13,880 to the low of $6,425 reached in December.      The cryptocurrency is currently trading above the falling channel resistance of $7,960. A breakout would be confirmed if prices close the week (Sunday, UTC) above $7,960. That would imply a continuation of the rally from April 2019 low of $4,100 and open the doors for a re-test of $13,880.      A breakout looks likely with bullish developments on key technical indicators.    Weekly and daily chart    Bitcoin’s rise to seven-week highs has confirmed seller exhaustion signaled by multiple long-tailed weekly candles and the bullish divergence of the MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and identify trend changes.      A bullish divergence occurs when an indicator produces higher lows, contradicting lower lows on price and is considered an advance warning of an impending bullish reversal. The MACD has charted higher lows since early December.      Meanwhile, the daily chart is reporting an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, also a bullish reversal pattern. The recent rally looks to have legs, as buying volumes (not shown) have risen over the last few days and the MACD is charting higher bars above the zero line, signaling a strengthening of bullish momentum.      All-in-all, the odds appear stacked in favor of a rise to $8,626 – the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $10,350 to $6,425.      The odds of bitcoin confirming a channel breakout this coming Sunday would drop if prices find acceptance below $8,000 with high volumes.      That said, stronger buying pressure could emerge in the subsequent weeks, yielding a breakout, as miner reward halving (supply-cutting event) is due in May.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $8,340, representing a 5.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.

42431364,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN235h,1578474000,Why Harvard Research on a Low-Profit Tezos Attack Matters for Proof-of-Stake,"A recent academic study says Tezos is threatened by ""selfish mining,"" providing a valid attack model for other live and up-and-coming proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies.      That’s the finding from Selfish Behavior in the Tezos Proof-of-Stake Protocol, published last November by then-Harvard researcher and current Google engineering intern Michael Neuder.      The paper from Neuder and other Harvard researchers shows the profitability – albeit small – of “selfish endorsing” attacks in Tezos, a variant of selfish mining.      Luckily for Tezos, the selfish mining concern can easily be patched through the network’s flexible on-chain governance model, which conducts periodic votes for protocol changes in lieu of hard or soft forks.      “It was a great research paper and we’d love to see more focus on economic and complex-system-interactions in cryptocurrency systems in academic and industrial research,” Tezos Foundation Chief Security Officer Ryan Lackey told CoinDesk in an email. “Thanks to our governance model, it’s pretty easy to get [the fix] adopted.”      However, the ability to address governance issues quickly raises questions concerning possible trade-offs involved with on-chain governance, how voting works and the possible outcomes of staking centralization.    Key findings    As described and proven by the researchers, a Tezos baker (the blockchain’s term for “miner”) can be rationally incentivized to create their own blocks and receive endorsements from other bakers not connected to the main chain, creating a secondary invalid chain.      Through the attack, the initial baker gains both the block and endorsement reward for the invalid block and can continue the attack until detected. If exposed, the baker’s stake is ""slashed,"" punishing the baker for dishonest mining.      In Tezos, stakers gain fractions of a block reward for endorsing the creation of a new block, which packages network transactions. Selfish mining occurs in Nakamoto-style consensus mechanisms, like Tezos, which follow the longest chain rule. Under the rule, the longest chain, containing the most work, is generally considered the correct pathway by network participants.      The attack is far from lucrative, however, for two reasons.      The net payout of an attack is insignificant – a mere 255 XTZ ($336 at today’s prices) for staking 40 percent of the network's outstanding supply in one year. It’s also highly costly if detected: Validators can have their stake in the network taken away if dishonesty is detected. Still, according to Messari research analyst Wilson Withiam, the study exposes understudied aspects of PoS.      “It goes to show how little we know about PoS mechanisms, let alone one in a working environment,” Withiam told CoinDesk. “As the less understood consensus mechanism next to Proof-of-Work, most PoS attack vectors may remain unknown, and code changes like those implemented via [Tezos governance update] Babylon could continue to unveil new vulnerabilities on live networks.”      Withiam said that with more PoS network’s launching in the near future, such as Eth 2.0 and Libra, understanding selfish-mining attacks remains “vital.”    Tezos’ take    The attack may be unlikely due to the high costs, but Tezos is still taking the issue seriously. An ongoing election is expected to pass a network upgrade altering endorsement incentives, according to Adrian Brink of Tezos blockchain research firm Cryptium Labs.      “It’s important to understand that most of these attacks (like selfish baking) are not short-term dangers but rather long-term dangers, since they are obvious if executed and only start to have a serious impact if executed over months to years,” Brink said via email.      The incident highlights Tezos’ on-chain governance, a unique feature among current blockchain protocols.      For selfish mining, Brink said changing incentives to decrease the likelihood of attacks is the goal.      “[The update] hardens the security model in order to make more likely attacks (such as the selfish baking attack) unprofitable for attackers unless they acquire a very large percentage of the stake,” said Brink.      Even with all the fancy coding, developing a holistic system remains difficult, said Brink.      “Generally it’s impossible to build a security model which is secure against everything,” he said. “Bitcoin’s mining model has many weaknesses and there have been countless papers written about it. So the trick with designing these systems is to make the right trade-offs.”    On-chain governance and staking centralization    Network attack vectors such as selfish mining highlight Tezos’ on-chain governance and the ability to address headaches before they become migraines.      Yet, compared to other chains, Tezos has taken the unexplored path when it comes to large-cap coins requiring censorship-resistance and stability.      For Tezos, the mounting centralization of staking on exchanges could have many unknown consequences.      As data firm Coinmetrics pointed out, the number of addresses staking 0.1 XTZ or more on Coinbase jumped 30 percent in one month following the exchange’s “free staking” announcement. What are the possible outcomes for mass staking on publicly identifiable – and therefore censorship prone – exchanges?      “Staking with coins held on an exchange is simpler than delegating or staking directly,” said Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter. “It's not surprising to me. Exchanges are kind of neo-banks serving the crypto community.” (Carter holds investments in XTZ.)      Carter said voting-based systems such as PoS require “a robust civil society.” In other words, information and participation are worth their weight in gold for these protocols.      “I think Tezos has done well in that respect,” Carter said. “They have high participation and generally an eagerness on the part of token holders to participate. Whether this impairs the censor resistance of the protocol – that's an interesting question we will grapple with soon, I believe.”",NEGATIVE,XTZ,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MINING | XTZ | RESEARCH,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/08/why-harvard-research-on-a-low-profit-tezos-attack-matters-for-proof-of-stake,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e89e5aa73ebea23cd8336689bca7e800be911b53-1500x987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
