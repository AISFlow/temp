42397385,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Aiu,1393695185,Inside the Race to Launch the First US Bitcoin ATM,"Eric L. Stromberg was pushing his old Ford Escort faster than it was used to, as he sped from California to New Mexico with his 125-pound traveling companion sitting silently in the back.  Stromberg had never spent a night in Albuquerque before, and he knew no one there. But Albuquerque was to about to become home for Stromberg and his passenger – a glossy white bitcoin ATM made by Lamassu.  This single-car interstate race had been part of Stromberg’s bid to launch the first bitcoin ATM in the United States.  First past the line  A month later, on 18th February, Stromberg announced that his machine was up and running at an Albuquerque cigar bar – and had been quietly dispensing bitcoins for a week.  Lamassu CEO Zach Harvey confirmed that Stromberg achieved his goal of being first – but he’s far from alone in the business.  Another team launched a Lamassu machine in Boston the next day, and rival ATM-maker Robocoin launched its first in Austin, Texas, soon after.  Altogether Lamassu has shipped 60 machines and taken orders for 140 more.  Excited and curious  They’re referred to as automatic teller machines, but the Lamassus are really automatic currency exchangers. They suck dollars – or any major currency – into their bill slots and transfer bitcoins into the customer’s digital wallet.  Even the ‘automatic’ part of their popular description has a caveat at this point: Stromberg supervises all transactions in order to ensure compliance with federal anti-money laundering regulations.  Lamassu says a coming software update will make that unnecessary, but for now, Stromberg stands next to his ATM during operating hours, recording customer names and addresses.  Being on the scene has given him a view on who’s using his machine.  “There are two kinds of people,” he said. “There are those who are very excited because they’ve been anticipating the kiosk opening, and there are those who had limited knowledge of bitcoin, for whom it’s more of a curiosity.”  A few dozen customers made transactions, mostly small, in the first week, and Stromberg is capping transactions at $1,000 each, for the time being.  How it works  In order to buy bitcoins from the ATM, a customer provides Stromberg with a driver’s licence or a business card as verification of their identity. If the customer already has a bitcoin wallet app on their smartphone, they are ready to go ahead with the transaction.  The machine displays its rate on the screen – it gets an up-to-the-minute price feed via wi-fi, and adds a 7% markup.  The customer pushes start, holds up a phone to the machine’s camera so it can read the QR code, and feed bills into the slot. As the bills go in, the screen displays a running total of how much bitcoin the customer will receive.  For customers without a bitcoin wallet, Stromberg can help set up a paper wallet.  Recording customer information takes a couple of minutes, Stromberg said, but the ATM does its work in about 15 seconds.  Costly wait  Stromberg’s relocation to New Mexico was his way of addressing just a few of the challenges that he and other would-be bitcoin ATM entrepreneurs have faced in their attempts to operate the machines legally and – ideally – profitably.  Regulatory hurdles, business plans, the machines’ current technical limitations, and the wild gyrations of the bitcoin/fiat exchange rate have all made for a bumpy road.  One of the first challenges was getting past what might have been. Stromberg and another Bay Area bitcoin enthusiast, Cole Albon, pre-ordered their ATMs last summer, paying $5,000 apiece, or 43 bitcoins at the time. As they awaited delivery of their machines, they watched the price of bitcoin skyrocket.  The day after Albon took delivery of his ATM, he invited some bitcoin enthusiasts to his San Francisco studio apartment to check it out. He was all too aware that one bitcoin was worth more than $600 that day, and he couldn't help but wonder if the machine could ever earn back its now-inflated purchase price.  “That $5,000 machine cost me $40,000. It’s been a bad investment,” Albon said, leaning against a Western-style blanket hanging on the wall and looking on as his guests explored the inside of the machine with a flashlight.  But Stromberg, who by that time was in Albuquerque, making cold calls on businesses that might want to host his machine, was more philosophical:  “If I had held those bitcoins, they would be worth six times as much now. But that’s looking in the rearview mirror.”  Personal coins  Stromberg left a job asvice president of search production engineering at Yahoo last year in order to devote himself to bitcoin full time. Lamassu’s ATMs fascinated him from the moment he learned about them.  “I thought it was a great way to do something tangible in the bitcoin space and explore the technology,” he said. While he said he is not “independently wealthy by any means”, he had enough saved up to self-fund the venture.  Looking ahead, Stromberg hopes to continue using the machine to sell his own stock of bitcoins – which he accumulated through a little mining and a lot of purchases on exchanges – and then continue buying bitcoins for the machine to dispense, with help from an investor.  The markup should allow him to make a small profit after expenses, he said.  Expansion plans  Stromberg is not sure if his relocation to Albuquerque is permanent. He is considering eventually purchasing more ATMs and expanding locally or even nationwide.  [post-quote]  After reading FinCEN guidelines, Stromberg is sure that his business, Enchanted Bitcoins, is a money services business and a money transmitter, so he has done the extensive paperwork to register as such. The only thing he is still waiting on is the bank account he applied for, which can take weeks.  Stephen Hudak, FinCEN spokesman, declined to comment on whether a bitcoin ATM operator qualifies as an MSB. Instead he referred to published guidelines and said: “If a business is unsure of their responsibilities, they should ask FinCEN directly for a ruling on their obligations.”  Stromberg chose to start his business in New Mexico because the state has not published money transmissions statutes, unlike California, which specifically requires businesses like his to be licensed.  Because of its “quite aggressive” licensing approach to money transmission, moving out of California is not an uncommon move for entrepreneurs in the payments business, said Felix Shipkevich, a New York attorney with extensive payments industry experience.  California money transmitters must put up a bond of $250,000 or more. That expense is one of the reasons that Albon's Lamassu is still sitting in his apartment.  “I don’t want to go try to find an investor,” Albon said, worrying that he could be held responsible for any investor’s past activities. “The Charlie Shrem [arrest] has me kind of scared.”  Technical limitations  Albon is also frustrated that the ATM does not automatically record the customer information needed to comply with regulations.  He had previously asked some friends modify the machine to extend its capabilities, and ended up breaking it temporarily. Now the ATM is working again, but he doesn’t see a path to operating it as a business in its current state.  “The machine needs to be able to take a picture of somebody’s ID, or only send bitcoins to somebody if we know who they are. Right now there’s no way to do that,” Albon said. Lacking a machine that works the way he needs it to, Albon has not yet registered as an MSB.  Lamassu engineers are busy working on ID verification software that will take care of this problem, Harvey said.  ""The hardware is all in place for this, so it would be a simple software update,"" he explained. “The user would scan the back of their driver’s licence into the machine, the machine would forward the info to a third party verification service, which would validate their identity and allow them to purchase up to the per-user daily limit that has been set by the operator."" Harvey added:  “This whole process should not take longer than 30 seconds.""  Users are still waiting for Lamassu to deliver the promised administrative interface, which will give them the ability to customize their machines, integrate them into an online exchange if desired, and set fees and rates.  “We are a bit behind schedule on this, but we have been making good progress lately and should have the basics out very soon,” Harvey said.  Legal confusion  Shipkevich warned that despite the entrepreneurs’ efforts at due diligence, it is not clear if it is even possible to operate a bitcoin ATM right now without running afoul of the law.  Traditional ATM machines are connected with bank accounts, whose customers’ identities have been verified through an established system.  The same is not true for bitcoin ATMs, and recording customer names and addresses is not an adequate substitute, he said. And operating in a state that has not established or interpreted rules in this area doesn't mean it’s a free for all, he added.  “Without really having the necessary regulatory infrastructure in place, the activities they’re performing are done at their own risk,” Shipkevich said.

42397375,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4AZ4,1393679934,Top Alabama Regulator Says Mt. Gox Was a 'Disaster About to Happen',"New York, California, Texas - home to high-tech incubators and venture capital firms, these are states you expect to issue statements regarding a disruptive technology like digital currency. Alabama? Perhaps not.  But, if you were surprised by the Alabama Securities Commission's recent warning about Mt. Gox and the dangers of digital currency investments, its director Joe Borg suggests you shouldn't be.  The motorcycle-driving, mustachioed regulator boasts about bringing more securities violators to trial, executing more foreign extraditions and obtaining more prison time for financial criminals ""than most of the other states combined"". In case that didn't paint the picture, he headed the investigation to take down Jordan Belfort, the real-life inspiration for The Wolf of Wall Street.  That's why when issues at troubled Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox began to build, Borg decided to take action to inform the public.  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Borg recounts the run-up to the warning and why he felt he needed to act:    ""To be honest with you, the Mt. Gox thing was obviously a disaster about to happen. When a broker-dealer suspends payments, that to me indicates that they're about to go out of business.      Now, I didn't say that in the [release], but that was my feeling.""    Most notable about the warning was Borg's call for securities regulators to act as ""cop on the beat"" in the digital currency space in order to protect and promote consumer welfare.  But, that's not to paint Borg as a Joe Manchin-style regulator calling for the demise of bitcoin. To Borg, the major issue with bitcoin is not its technology, it's the lack of consumer awareness about the risks involved.  Bitcoin in Alabama  To fully understand the issue of consumer protection regarding bitcoin, Borg explains you need to first understand Alabama, a place where God and football come before all else. Here, like much of the rest of America, consumers aren't exactly savvy investors, he says.  As evidence, he cites the turning point for bitcoin in Alabama. Borg said that it wasn't its explosive run-up in value or even growing awareness about the groundbreaking technology it uses. Rather, it took a college football fan who earned $20,000 for waving a sign for locals to pay attention.  ""When that happened, we got calls about 'How do we get into this bitcoin thing?' They had no idea what they were talking about [...] They assume there's some company that issues it. Obviously you have no business being in the bitcoin market if that's how you think it operates.""  Retail investors, Borg argues, simply aren't paying attention, not just to bitcoin, but to any investments, whether it's ""Apple stock or FlyByNight.com"", and that because of this, they could be severely harmed, especially in light of ""questionable actions"" by exchanges.  More education needed  Such stories, Borg said, negate one of the most often cited claims of bitcoin defenders, that retail investors know bitcoin is a high-risk investment. In his letter, Borg railed against the bitcoin world for not taking such concerns seriously, and for operating without regard for traditional financial safeguards.  Read the letter:  ""I’m not understanding about how great this can be if the basics, like getting your money back in a timely and orderly fashion, aren’t in place.""  In the interview, Borg reiterated his past statements, citing his observations as proof investors aren't as well-informed as the bitcoin community claims:  ""If that's the case, then why are all these protestors out here saying 'Where's my money?' Why are all these 'folks who know' they could lose their money overnight filing complaints. I guess they weren't expecting to lose all their money.""  But, Borg isn't ready to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Though he admits his personal understanding of bitcoin isn't nuanced, he cautions that he's ""not against the technology.""  ""I think the technology has outrun its ability to educate and put some controls on this thing,"" he said.  Borg suggested that because the stock market offers protections for these consumers, many assume the same protections apply to this new market.  If a retail investor from Alabama were to have a broker-dealer disappear, he said, they would have recourse from organizations like the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which is dedicated to strengthening the US banking system.  ""There's nothing like that in this market,"" Borg said.  Bitcoin business heads South  For these reasons, Borg said his organization has looked at more than 100 applications for bitcoin exchanges that are seeking to do business in Alabama. But in two years, he hasn't approved one to operate in the state.  The problem, he said, lies in the fact that many don't do the due diligence to follow traditional regulation.  Said Borg:  ""We sit down and we go, 'OK have you talked to FinCEN? Tell me how your security works.' We talk about, what happens if we do this, and they look at me like. 'Oh, well we hadn't thought about it.'""  Though, he noted the applications are improving, and that he's not opposed to applications that take the right precautions.  Borg said he was particularly impressed with one from a certain outfit out of New York. Though notably, this was put on hold due to the ongoing Mt. Gox scandal.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/01/top-alabama-regulator-says-mt-gox-was-a-disaster-about-to-happen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fec87ed1051b325aa336c49bb1a8db80d9e9d0c-1000x700.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397384,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Ahv,1393664559,"Singapore Shopping Mall Debuts Bitcoin ATM, Draws Impressive Queue","Singapore received its second official bitcoin ATM on 28th February when a Lamassu unit debuted at Citylink Mall.  With a retail space of 60,000 square feet, the country's first underground mall is not the largest to host a bitcoin ATM. But, the venue is still in a high-profile location that connects City Hall with local transit and hotels, which should help ensure its visibility.  Of the launch, Zann Kwan, executive director of Singapore-based Bitcoin Exchange Pte Ltd, the company operating the ATM, said she was ""happy to bring this potentially groundbreaking technology to Asia and Singapore"".  Kwan cited the launch as evidence of Singapore's fast-growing bitcoin community, and indicated that her company plans to install more bitcoin ATMs by the end 2014. In particular, she noted the group would continue to target public locations with a heavy traffic flow.  The bitcoin ATM, which the company said is ""Asia's first public"" ATM, will be open from 5am to midnight every day, local time.  Notably, the announcement comes just one day after Singapore-based ATM provider Tembusu Terminals revealed the country's first permanent bitcoin ATM.  About the launch  Bitcoin Exchange indicated that it helped promote the machine with a bitcoin giveaway, in what seems to be an increasingly popular tactic among groups launching bitcoin ATMs.  Zann said that the first 50 users would receive S$5 in cash and a paper wallet as part of the first-day giveaway that inspired long lines of interested users.  Still, the event hasn't been all positive. Redditors took issue with Bitcoin Exchange, as it did not comment on its fees. The company did not answer questions about its pricing online, but did provide a statement as to why the ATM requires fees.  ""Doing this is actually harder than most people probably think. There is a reason this is one of the first public machines in Asia. [...] There are legal risks, price risk, technical risks and so on and of course hardware costs, rent and so on.""  International expansion  Bitcoin Exchange indicated that though Singapore has been its initial focus, it is also exploring opportunities in its neighboring nations in Southeast Asia.  Still, despite the company's enthusiasm for the endeavor its market seems to have already been limited by the harsh stances taken by regulators in Vietnam and Thailand. Further, it remains unclear what actions Singapore will pursue regarding bitcoin regulation.
