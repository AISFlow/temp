BitRush is a publicly traded company on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) in Toronto. At the board meeting (Dec 7, 2016), a majority of the directors appointed a Special Committee of the Board to investigate the circumstances leading to the cease trade order and related matters to report its findings to the Board. The Board also terminated Werner Boehm as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective immediately, as a result of actions taken by him without Board approval to the detriment of the Company, including issuing unauthorized and inaccurate press releases. It turned out that Werner Böhm as CEO deceived and betrayed shareholders as well as people whom he called friends. Based on this revealed behavior of the recalled CEO, Bitrush was forced to file a lawsuit against Werner Böhm. Below you can read some passages from the verdict, which prove the criminal action of Werner Böhm from the point of view of the court. “Böhm’s conduct as set out herein was oppressive, unfairly prejudicial and unfairly disregarded the interests of BitRush’s shareholders.” “Böhm was clearly aware that the dispute with BitRush was a legitimate business dispute caused solely by Boehm's failure to honor his prior agreements.” “Böhm’s actions in transferring a total of more than 500.000 CAD from BitRush to companies controlled by him and subsequently refusing to account for the transfers or to return the money when requested constitutes further misappropriation of BitRush's property.” “The money was clearly misappropriated by Böhm.” “… (a shareholder) learned that no shares were ever deposited into escrow in his name.” “Once again the agreement was never reduced to writing.” “Böhm did not advice the board.” “Böhm’ s conduct clearly breached the reasonable expectations of Bitrush and its shareholders.” “Not only Böhm failed to ensure that BitRush was entitled to use the technology from the very inception of Bitrush, he never took any steps to ensure that was done nor did he ever advise the Board that was the case.” The court verdict (Nov 14, 2017) found him responsible and his company MezzaCap Ltd “guilty”. Image Credit; Werner Böhm: Schon wieder Troubles – (c) APA/HANS PUNZ (HANS PUNZ) He was ordered to cancel more than 16 million of MezzaCap’s shares and to transfer more than 10 million out of these canceled shares to the lawful owners. These owners were accused of money laundering by Werner Bohm. This accusation turned out to be fictitious and intended only to damage the reputation of these honorable people. Additionally, the court ordered that costs of the applicants fixed at more than 200.000 CAD payable by Werner Böhm & MezzaCap. Some know Werner Böhm’s feeble-minded blogs in which he tries to portray himself as a victim. In his blogs he loves to throws dirt at his former friends and business partners. He uses the articles written by him (under various pseudonyms which nourish the suspicion of a multiple personalities) to completely distort facts and to express his almost pathological ideas from the point of view of a ""true and independent expert"". In his columns, he likes to play an investigative journalist and uses misrepresentations to put his own more than dubious actions in a positive light. Unfortunately, he does it so well that people are still falling for his pure lies. Here is a clear example of his handling of Bitrush. Firstly, he told false facts to shareholders and refrained from signing his commitments and denies them afterwards. Then, when consequences are drawn (he was dismissed as CEO) he does not hesitate to accuse shareholders and associates of fictitious criminal offenses and to report his stories to police and judiciary. Hard to believe, he feels victimised when called to further explain his twisted perception. Werner Böhm is trying to establish a business under the name ""The Blockchain Litigation Funder"". He wants to rip off more investors with his so-called ""Litigation Token"". Within this model he seeks to convince people that investing in this company promotes and ultimately enforces the truth and legal certainty. It is regrettable that such a person as Werner Böhm is always attracted to emerging business models (such as crypto payments, etc.) and harm shareholders in an unprecedented and planned manner. So, long story short, the clear recommendation regarding dealing with Werner Böhm, AVOID a person who has been slipping from one court case to another for almost 20 years. Even though he has escaped conviction several times, in the end a court found him guilty on several levels in which a trustworthy CEO would never be engaged in (e.g. misappropriation of money and shares, oppressive behavior, failure to honour his agreements etc.). Unfortunately, nobody can dissuade Werner from his dishonest and destructive behavior. We want to bring to the public attention what “Werner” deserves, please do not deal with this individual and his companies. You have been warned.

42428093,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5wxh,1510956622,Gox ICO? CEO Karpeles Floats Token Sale to Revive Bitcoin Exchange,"A Mt Gox initial coin offering (ICO)? It's not unthinkable, according to the defunct bitcoin exchange's controversial CEO.  In a blog post published yesterday, Mark Karpeles detailed possible avenues for reviving Mt Gox, the once-dominant Japanese bitcoin exchange that collapsed amid allegations of fraud and mismanagement in early 2014. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin – at then-current prices – were feared lost, though ultimately 202,000 BTC were retained as assets, under the custody of a trustee.  In the aftermath, Mt Gox entered bankruptcy, and has since been at the center of an acrimonious, years-long claims process, including a $75 million claim from CoinLab. Prosecutors in Japan later charged Karpeles with embezzlement, with that trial beginning earlier this summer.  The blog post also addressed a recent bone of contention: while the value of the remaining Gox BTC has swelled as bitcoin's price has climbed to close to $8,000 per coin, those seeking to recoup their losses may ultimately collect much less, if anything.  And while some are clamoring for that increase in value to be factored into the payouts, Karpeles pushed back on the idea in the blog post, stating that those gains haven't actually been realized yet, among other complications (the bitcoins remain in the custody of the Mt Gox trustee).  One possible avenue around the issue: reviving Mt Gox, with a price tag of $245 million. This could be accomplished either through a recapitalization by way of an equity sale or an ICO, according to Karpeles.  He wrote:  ""Launch an ICO to raise money to hypothetically revive MtGox. This sounds more challenging, both legally and because there is no guarantee of raising enough to revive MtGox. In case there is not enough raised it could still be locked to be distributed to creditors, which would be better than nothing.""  And in a seeming acknowledgement that the idea is rather far-fetched at present, Karpeles suggested that anyone interested in recapitalizing the exchange should get in touch.  ""Should anyone have 245 million USD sitting around and want to purchase MtGox, just drop me an email,"" he wrote.

In an interview with Bloomberg, UBS chief investment officer Mark Haefele said that a lack of government oversight and ""critical mass"" around cryptocurrencies is keeping the company – Switzerland's largest bank – out of the market.  Haefele also said that the idea the government could crack down on bitcoin, citing its possible use for terrorism financing, has also dampened any prospects of UBS getting involved.  He told Bloomberg:  ""All it would take would be one terrorist incident in the U.S. funded by bitcoin for the U.S. regulator to much more seriously step in and take action. That's a risk, an unquantifiable risk, bitcoin has that another currency doesn't.""  Because bitcoin isn't sponsored or backed by any government, it can be used to avoid being monitored, he argued. However, Haefele added that he does not think this situation will last.  He went on to say that the prevailing question around investing in anything is when to get out, asking: ""So how do you know when to get out of a bitcoin investment?""  Haefele is not the first UBS member to openly express concerns about bitcoin. The company's chief economist, Paul Donovan, compared bitcoin to the Netherlands' 1637 tulip mania in a series of tweets earlier this month.  And the chief executive of UBS, Sergio Ermotti, told CNBC last month that he he far more bullish on blockchain than he is about cryptocurrencies specifically.

42428096,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5x5h,1510944335,Ethereum Could Soon Launch Its First Casper Testnet,"Ethereum developers are looking to use code for their experimental Casper proof-of-stake protocol as the basis for a new test network.  During a core developer meeting today, ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin said that not only is Casper ready to be tested, but that it could provide a security boost when testing code across clients. It's a prospect that could come as a relief to developers, particularly those working on projects that must interface with the network's varied client offerings.  This is because the only cross-client test environment, Ropsten, is currency built using proof-of-work (like the main ethereum network), and because there are so few miners supporting that particular chain, it's a frequent target for attack. The remaining testnets, Rinkeby and Coven, use a proof-of-authority protocol to help remove these threats, but the lack of interoperability is far from ideal for some developers.  And while Casper itself isn't ready for wide-spread adoption – let alone integration on the main ethereum chain – it might be the prime time to start testing it out, some suggested in the meeting.  ""If we realistically want to roll out Casper in whatever hard fork, then eventually people need to start implementing it,"" argued developer Peter Szilagyi.  The meeting confirmed that Casper has a full Python implementation and that it has undergone some minor testing.  Looking ahead, there are also security questions that arise from using Casper as the basis for testnet. However, Buterin argued that this could be resolved by designating the network's ether to a team of elected delegates – a move that would, in part, mirror the current proof-of-authority system, which is governed by a select few.  The meeting's participants ultimately decided to conduct research toward a new test environment, to be led by ethereum developer Piper Merriam along with representatives from the Parity, Geth and Casper development teams.  And while there are evidently a few problems that need to be worked out, Szilágyi emphasized the importance of ""fun"" in a testing environment, stating:  ""Maybe it would be nice to have a test network that people actually want to use.""

42428109,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5xRh,1510940712,"No Fork, No Fire: Segwit2x Nodes Stall Running Abandoned Bitcoin Code","The Segwit2x bitcoin fork may have been formally called off, but as many as 150 nodes still running its code have stopped accepting transaction blocks.  Data from Bitnodes shows that 95 nodes are currently running 2x software and are stuck at block number 494,782. CoinDance, another network data site, says that 154 nodes are running the ""btc1"" software as of press time.  The situation is a curious one, given that the 2x fork effort – advanced by a group of startups, miners and community supporters as a way to expand the transaction capacity of the bitcoin network – was effectively disbanded on Nov. 8 following an email circulated on the project's mailing list. Yet despite the abandonment, dozens of nodes continue to be operated that use the most-recent btc1 software release.  Today's stoppage appears to be driven by an issue in the code that prevented miners from actually producing a larger-than-1 MB block that would push nodes running Segwit2x into its own chain. Amid growing discussion in the project's Slack channel, developer Jeff Garzik released a patch aimed at easing the creation of a bigger transaction block (though in the absence of strong mining support, it's unlikely that the network will advance).  And even though the Segwit2x fork itself won't move forward, today's development revived some of the acrimony between those who supported the effort and those who have voiced vehement opposition to it.  One particular point of contention is the exact block number at which the fork was supposed to activate.  Past materials indicate that this block would have been 494,784, leading critics to say that developer Garzik had an ""off-by-one"" error and that, if carried out, the nodes planning to fork could have been caught in limbo. Garzik, in turn, has argued that the code is operating as intended in the absence of significant hashing power.  It also remains to be seen whether some – if any – of the nodes in question see their software changed. Data from Bitnodes suggests that a number of them reside on hosting services from companies like Amazon and Alibaba.  So unless that larger-than-1 MB block arrives, the nodes that are running the software will have to keep waiting.

Meanwhile, volatility in the stock-markets is at an all-time low …The big fact is that the total market cap of the crypto-currency universe recently zoomed above $170 billion. Its robust health annoyed “analogue” money men such as Jamie Dimon, but frankly the longer they reject the emerging evidence, the better for Bitcoin investors.Liquidity is pouring into crypto-currencies and leaking away from the over-leveraged equities world. In a sense, Bitcoin has become a tail hedge against the money markets, especially because it is not correlated with other assets - and the possibility exists that it will actually prove to be inversely correlated once a major correction occurs in the NYSE and elsewhere.

42428111,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5xXh,1510929016,Ripple Makes a Splash: XRP Price Looks Up on Amex News,"Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is trading on the front foot again.  Having hit a 4-week high of $0.27 at 14:00 UTC yesterday, the Ripple-U.S. dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate is back to at $0.23 at press time – up 7 percent on the day, as per CoinMarketCap.  And though the spike has faded somewhat, there are reasons to be optimistic about the cryptocurrency's price going forward.  The strong bid tone in XRP may be associated with yesterday's revelation that American Express (Amex) and Santander have teamed up with Ripple for direct cross-border payments via the company's blockchain tech.  Though XRP itself is not being used, Ripple's blockchain network will help facilitate the near-immediate transfer of funds from Amex's corporate customers in the U.S. to businesses that bank with Santander UK. Ripple has also said it expects XRP to play more of a role in future partnerships.  Comments made by Ripple's CEO yesterday to Bloomberg can't be hurting the price, either. ""It’s only a matter of time before central banks adopt blockchain to settle high-value, interbank fund transfers,"" Brad Garlinghouse told the news source.  But while the news flow looks supportive of prices, the charts also favor further upside in XRP.  Daily chart  The above chart shows:  Rounding bottom formation.  Relative strength index (RSI) above 50.00 (in the bullish territory).  Prices trade above the 50-day moving average (MA) ($0.2172), but below the rounding bottom neckline level of $0.22.  A rounding bottom is a long-term reversal pattern that indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. A move above the neckline is usually considered a confirmation of the bullish trend.  View  A close today (as per UTC) above $0.2288 would confirm rounding bottom breakout/bullish trend reversal and open up upside towards $0.30 (Oct. 16 high) and $0.3291 (Jun. 1 high).  Any dips are likely to be short-lived, given the 5-day MA and 10-day MA is curled up in favor of the bulls.  However, multiple 4-hour closes below $0.20 could abort the bullish view.

42421812,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXv5gL,1510918251,Friends Don't Let Friends Do Bad Crypto,"Dan Elitzer is the blockchain and digital identity lead at IDEO CoLab, an R&D network that explores the impact of emerging tech through cross-industry collaborations.  In this opinion piece, Elitzer explains why designing for security requires thinking about platforms beyond one's own.      Recently I met with the founding team of a group building a project in the cryptocurrency space. They walked my IDEO CoLab colleagues and me through their web app, showing how users could buy and store bitcoin or ether in a custodial wallet, and then use those funds in a variety of ways. I noticed that they also had an option to enter a private key directly to make a transaction.  RED ALERT!  First rule of crypto: never, ever, EVER share your private key.  Corollary: Be extremely skeptical, if not outright suspicious, of any service or communication requesting your private key.  Having met with this team previously and knowing their impressive backgrounds, I asked – relatively calmly – why they were asking for a private key. The chief technology officer explained that they were implementing a MyEtherWallet-style tool for signing transactions in the browser, so the private key would never be sent to their server.  The intent was to allow users to easily use the service without having to let the platform take custody of funds, while also eliminating the friction associated with having to open up a separate wallet application to generate, sign, and broadcast a transaction. It removes a few steps – hooray for user experience – but does the shortcut really warrant the trade-offs?  I'm very sympathetic to the view that UX in the crypto world is horrible and there's a need to get creative in exploring opportunities for simplification. And as the team pointed out, from a technical perspective, they would not be exposing users to any more risk than if those users entered their private keys on MyEtherWallet.  That's true – they could implement the exact same open source code as MyEtherWallet. I trust that they would do this properly and I expect that some meaningful amount of their future users would be willing to trust them and feel secure entering private keys on this website.  However, my concern is not primarily whether they could securely implement in-browser transaction signing; as I said, I trust both their competence and their intentions.  What worries me more is that this gives the false impression, especially to those new to cryptocurrencies, that it is OK to enter your private key on a website.  Basic information hygiene  Most people are used to operating in the context where if a password is compromised, even for a bank account, usually the damage is at least somewhat reversible. Crypto is different: if you share your private keys, you lose everything. There is no recourse for getting back your stolen bitcoin, ether, or other tokens.  A secure, trustworthy service requesting private keys normalizes the concept of users sharing private keys with services that they use. This is bad.  Even if the company in question is trustworthy, it is a virtual guarantee that everyone buying, using, or participating in the cryptocurrency ecosystem in any way will at some point encounter a hacker or scammer trying to steal their money. Training users that a request to enter their private keys can be legitimate increases the likelihood that those users will fall victim to a scam in the future.  An analog to this is when a traditional financial services company calls a customer about an issue and requests that the customer provide data like their account number, address, or last 4 digits of their Social Security nunber before proceeding.  NO!  Do not train your customers to share information or attempt to conduct any account-related interactions on a phone call that the customer did not initiate him or herself!  (For anyone to whom this is news: please always, always, ALWAYS end such calls immediately and call back through a support line listed on the website of the company in question.)  A high bar of trust  During a deep conversation that revealed the team had given a lot of consideration to security and usability tradeoffs, the startup CEO asked, ""Why is it okay for MyEtherWallet to ask users to enter their private keys or upload their keystore files, but not OK for us to do so?"" That's a fair question.  First, I would assume that the majority of people entering their private keys to use MyEtherWallet originally generated those private keys on MyEtherWallet with the intention of using them on MyEtherWallet in the future. If you already trusted a website or application to generate your keys, you're not greatly expanding your attack surface by continuing to trust them when you go to use those keys.  Second, there's a special role that wallet software and services play in this ecosystem. They are the agent that mediates the user's interaction with the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and it is absolutely imperative that the user trusts that their wallet is presenting accurate information to them and is behaving in accordance with the user's intent. As such, there is an incredibly high bar of trust that wallet developers must achieve before knowledgeable cryptocurrency users will consider using them to manage their assets.  If the cryptocurrency ecosystem is ever going to develop in such a way that tokens are useful for applications beyond just investment or speculation, we'll see hundreds, thousands, possibly even millions, of services built that include interactions where users need to generate signatures with their private keys. Expecting people to be able to discern whether they should trust a new service they encounter with their private keys is untenable.  Beware impostors  One suggestion a colleague of mine had was for MyEtherWallet (or another highly trusted service) to create a transaction-signing widget that could be embedded in other sites, so users could be confident entering their private keys. The startup CEO even suggested that the company might even create such a tool itself and publish it for others to use. While I applaud the sentiment of building something useful and sharing it with others, the problem is not one that can be solved in this way.  Let's say MyEtherWallet did create a branded transaction-signing widget. How would visitors to a site with the widget embedded know that it was a genuine MyEtherWallet widget rather than a lookalike that would steal their private keys? ""They can just do a checksum."" Well, to trust that a checksum is valid, the user would need to first know what a checksum is, then run it themselves. Any visual cue as to the validity of the widget or checksum could easily be faked.  Unless and until it becomes reasonable to assume that an overwhelming majority of users have their own agent software automatically verifying signatures and running checksum functions, using easily faked visual cues to signify security will only increase the vulnerability of your users.  We're all in this together  It turns out that this wonderful, trustless future that so many of us are striving to create isn't actually so trustless.  In fact, it's not even trust-minimized.  It's trust-specified: we need to be very specific about who we are trusting for what tasks. It's incumbent on all participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem to help users develop an understanding and intuition for this by only asking users for the bare minimum amount of trust and permissions that we need and pointing them to reputable services who follow best practices in security and disclosure for all other functions.  Our responsibility to our users does not end when they leave our site or close our app. Behaviors they learn from us – or that we contribute to normalizing – will guide whether and how they interact with the myriad of other services they encounter in the future. In an industry where user mistakes are frequently irreversible, it's incumbent upon all of us to keep the aperture of user expectations as narrowly focused as possible on the least risky behaviors.  We can build a more secure and more user-friendly future for everyone, but only if we stay vigilant about security for our users across all services they interact with, not just our own.

Expected to launch by early 2019, the new network will now involve participation from over 20 global banks and financial institutions, a Business Times report says. The announcement of the new members of the project was made during the Singapore Fintech Festival on Thursday.  The proof-of-concept – called the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) – is a collaboration between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), aimed to digitize trade finance using distributed ledger technology (DLT).  According to the officials from the two monetary authorities, the DLT pilot – which is described as a ""global trade connectivity network"" (GTCN) – is expected to set ""new global standards"" for the industry and aims to trace global trade flows between Singapore and Hong Kong.  Li Shu-Pui, executive director of the HKMA said that there have been concerns from bankers regarding data and transaction privacy. As a result, regulators should consider regulations around DLT, he said, since it is a new form of innovation in the ""mission-critical"" trade finance space.  Li indicated that he also expects European financial institutions to get involved in the project as it progresses.

42428106,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5xNh,1510909230,The Beginning? Tezos Could Open Doors for ICO Litigation,"While startups launching initial coin offerings (ICOs) may be all too aware they're working in a legal gray area, that might not be enough to stop lawsuits that could test their legality.  At issue is that, although the U.S. agency tasked with enforcing securities law – the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – has voiced concerns about cryptocurrency tokens (even labeling one a security), it has yet to announce much in the way of formal rules.  But while the SEC would have bearing on criminal lawsuits, courts hearing civil suits aren't necessarily constrained or dictated by the SEC's lack of a formal position on ICOs. Instead, these courts would make decisions based on their prior rulings and the specific circumstances of a case.  But what would that decision be? That question hinges on another: What makes an ICO a security or something else? Although attempts to interpret existing law have been made, it's unclear even to those in the know.  Now, following the news that Tezos, one of the largest most visible startups yet to use the ICO funding mechanism, has been hit with two lawsuits, it seems lawyers and litigators are lining up to press the issue, potentially with the aim of a payday in mind.  Sara Hanks, CEO of CrowdCheck, a consultancy that assists entrepreneurs and investors with crowdfunding campaigns, told CoinDesk:  ""We know of a number of plaintiffs' lawyers around the country who are just basically collecting lists of ICOs and going 'Hmm, I'm going to sue these people.'""  And the interest seems to be coming from lawyers working in similar sectors where a mix of lax regulation and bad actors have created the conditions for both suits and abuse.  Jaspar Ward, a partner at Louisville-based Jones Ward, which has filed class actions against fantasy sports services, sought to stress that he sees ICOs as an area of interest for precisely those factors.  ""We see this as the next area where consumers could get harmed by some bad actors taking advantage of the lack of oversight or by pushing the envelope,"" Ward said.  Casting a wide net  And according to some, Tezos is the prototypical defendant for such a lawsuit.  While the ideas underlying the project itself date back to the earliest days of blockchain (the white paper it's based on has been in progress since 2014), the company has clear ties to the U.S. (which aids lawyers in the collectability of rewarded funds) and has attracted a significant number of buyers to its sale.  Dynamic Ledger Solutions, for instance, is a Delaware-based company that holds Tezos’ intellectual property and the source code for its yet-to-be-developed technology.  ""The ICO most appealing to a plaintiff lawyer would be large in terms of total money raised, have a strong U.S. nexus, would have promoters and participants in the ICO who are U.S.-based, and the tokens that it would issue would reflect a claim on the share of the company’s future revenue,"" explained Joel Fleming of Block & Leviton, adding succinctly:  ""Tezos certainly checks a lot of those boxes.""  As chronicled by CoinDesk, the allegations against Tezos include both fraud and the sale of unregistered securities, though it's the latter that may be most notable here.  The idea is that civil lawsuits from disgruntled token holders may force the SEC's hand outlining an official stance on whether ICOs are indeed securities, which in turn, could have ramifications that extend far beyond just Tezos.  Setting the table  In this way, the case against Tezos could set important legal precedents, and in remarks, lawyers surveyed appeared to already be thinking about how to demonstrate that token offerings like those by Tezos could be deemed securities.  According to Jake Walker, also of Block & Leviton, which has launched an investigation of its own into Tezos, proving the sale of unregistered securities pursuant to the 1933 Securities Act is ""much more of a 'check the box' litigation"" than proving fraud.  He continued, ""That kind of flaunting of securities laws is something that definitely stands out to the plaintiff's bar and to us.""  While these lawsuits could spur other ICO issuers to rethink their token scheme's structure to shield themselves from liability, Walker believes it may be too little, too late.  ""Tezos is far from the only ICO that we see that has substantial U.S. involvement and U.S. entities that would clearly be participants in the sale of unregistered securities and be potentially liable,"" he said.  Others appeared to agree that this issue could be settled in court, or that at least, the incentives are there for law firms to attack the issue.  David Silver, the partner at SilverMiller in South Florida who filed the second suit yesterday against Tezos, believes his case could serve as a springboard for future ICO litigation.  ""This is a leak in a dam that is about to come falling down,"" he told CoinDesk.  Not so fast  But, the attractiveness of Tezos as a target doesn't mean a judgement against them will necessarily implicate other, similar projects.  ""A Delaware company changes everything,"" said Silver, stressing that, with distributed technologies, proving a tie to a location could prove key for litigators.  Further, because most plaintiffs' lawyers work on a contingency basis, meaning that they are paid a percentage of the judgments they win on behalf of clients, they tend to shy away from cases where recovering funds awarded could be problematic – such as when companies are sheltered overseas.  Since there are more foreign-registered ICOs than U.S-based ones, lawyers might see the opportunity cost as too high and move on to other things.  ""It gets significantly more complicated when they are overseas or foreign entities,"" said Fleming. Plus, ""in terms of collectability, it’s a bit more difficult given that most of the ICOs are raising their money not in fiat currency but in bitcoin or ether.""  And of course, a class action lawsuit against an ICO requires finding enough dissatisfied token holders who want to pursue legal recourse.  Silver concluded:  ""At one point in time, I said into a camera that I planned on filing 30 (class actions against ICOs) in 30 days. I have since walked that statement back because finding ICOs to whom we can sue and collect has been harder than I anticipated.""

In a patent application recently released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the company outlines how it could use a distributed ledger to record who owns an asset, as well as use digital wallets to allow owners to access these assets.  According to the application:  “Information regarding the ownership of particular assets (e.g., shares in a company, etc.) are stored in a blockchain, and various data processing operations (referred to below as ""application processing"") are performed using this ownership information.”  The application notes each block’s cryptographic hash value as an attractive feature, stating that the fact that a blockchain cannot be modified by malicious actors acts as an effective security function in protecting asset ownership data.  The fact that users can maintain privacy even with a public blockchain only adds to the technology’s attractiveness, according to the application.  Nasdaq would commit to a distributed network where each node would contain a copy of of the blockchain’s information, according to the application.  Nasdaq is looking into distributed ledgers to store ownership information, but are not necessarily committing to the technology.  The application states that “while distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain show great potential, further improvements in the performance, efficiency, and capabilities of such technologies are needed.”  The stock exchange has expressed concerns about blockchain technology before. Earlier this month, Gustaf von Boisman, Nasdaq Clearing’s head of product development, said the technology cannot be immediately implemented into their existing systems.  At the time, Boisman said the issues revolved around integrating blockchain-based systems with other financial systems.

42428107,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5xPh,1510891247,Europe's Executive Arm Issues Report on Blockchain For Education,"The executive arm of the European Union has issued a new report on the potentials of blockchain technology in the education sector.  Called ""Blockchain in Education,"" the European Commission report explores the feasibility, challenges, benefits and risks of applications of blockchain technology in schools and universities. Aimed at policymakers, the study represents an exploratory review of the topic, focusing on the state-of-the-art of the field in Europe.  The report explained:  ""This exploratory study addresses the value... blockchain may bring to stakeholders within the educational sector, with a particular focus on its potential for digital accreditation of personal and academic learning.""  The report goes on to propose eight scenarios in which the authors believe blockchain can be applied to challenges in the industry, including digital certification, multi-step accreditation, the recognition and transfer of credits and student payment transactions.  On a concluding note, however, the study cautioned that blockchain applications for education are still in their infancy, stressing that only ""fully open"" implementations can achieve the real goals and the promise of blockchain in education.  That said, blockchain interest is growing among educational institutions.  MIT, for instance, recently issued digital diplomas to over 100 graduates as a part of a pilot project using blockchain technology. This project was followed closely by a pilot focused on digital certifications and led by a U.S. non-profit medical board group for medical graduates.  Likewise, governments are showing an interest in pushing the tech forward here as well, with Malta's government even trialing blockchain to track academic certifications.

42428102,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5xFh,1510882527,Mimblewimble Just Launched Its First Testnet,"The experimental blockchain network mimblewimble has launched on testnet.  Known for its creative use of Harry Potter references, the project was proposed last year by a cryptographer going by the pseudonym ""Tom Elvis Jedusor"" (French for Harry Potter's archnemesis Lord Voldemort). And while such trappings may make it silly to some, developers are serious about the tech – arguing it improves scalability and privacy with cutting-edge cryptography.  Now, the team behind the effort is taking its first step toward putting the code to the test.  As explained by lead developer Ignotus Peverell, the testnet will offer a workshop of sorts for developers, complete with fake coins that allow them to detect (and correct) issues before launching a version with real money on the line.  The developer went on to explain that with the testnet (called testnet1) up and running, a few developers are mining and running the nodes that follow the cryptocurrency's unique rules.  He told CoinDesk:  ""There's still a lot of work, but it's a big milestone for us.""  Users can now operate a node and connect to the Grin network by ""building"" the software through a process described on GitHub. They can also send cryptocurrency tokens (also called 'grin') to other testnet users with the aim of helping plot out issues.  ""We hope to have as many bug reports as possible, so we can start fixing issues we've overlooked,"" Peverell said. ""At this point, one can still expect failures that would be a complete nightmare on a mainnet.""  Transactions and beyond  In short, Peverell anticipates there will be many versions of the testnet.  ""This is our first testnet, so we're testing everything that has been developed so far. That includes the peer-to-peer network, the core consensus rules, the cryptography required to run a mimblewimble chain, the wallet software,"" Peverell added.  Later versions, he suggested, will include more advanced features such as so-called ""scriptless scripts"" that would add other functionalities, such as Lightning Networks, to Grin.  Still, it might not be too long before the cryptocurrency goes live. According to Peverell, the team is aiming for launch ""sometime in 2018.""
