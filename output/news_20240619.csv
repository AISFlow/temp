29703513,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625483,1718838041,Bitcoin Market Alert: German Government Agency Sends $425M Worth Of BTC To Exchanges,"Bitcoin (BTC) recently plunged to a one-month low of $64,000, causing concern among bullish investors who now fear impending selling pressure and a potential retest of lower support levels. Adding to these concerns, it has come to light that a wallet belonging to the German police has moved $425 million worth of BTC to cryptocurrency exchanges, according to on-chain data firms. This development has sparked speculation about the agency’s intentions and potential market impact. Selling Pressure Concerns On Wednesday, crypto data analytics firm Arkham detected a significant cryptocurrency wallet named “German Government (BKS),” transferring 6,500 BTC, equivalent to $425 million. The wallet, which had held over 50,000 BTC since the end of January 2024, moved the funds to a new address. Some of the transferred BTC was sent to popular exchanges Kraken and Bitstamp. Related Reading: Altcoin Massacre? Prices Plummet 40-90%, Recovery Stalled — Analyst The recent movement of BTC by the German government agency follows a significant seizure of 50,000 BTC in January. At the time, it was regarded as the largest cryptocurrency seizure ever conducted in Germany. The bulk of the BTCs were seized by German police, with the suspects voluntarily transferring them to official wallets provided by the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). Currently, the government wallet contains 43,350 BTC with a total value of over $2.8 billion. Crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades suggested that transferring BTC from the German government’s wallet to exchanges may have contributed to the emergence of short positions and a slight dip in Bitcoin’s price during Wednesday’s trading session. This move raises concerns about potential selling pressure in the market and its impact on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Bitcoin Faces Downtrend Signal Regarding price action analysis of the largest cryptocurrency on the market, BTC is at a crucial juncture as analysts offer contrasting perspectives. Technical analyst Ali Martinez suggests a potential continuation of the downtrend as Bitcoin’s recent breach of the +0.5σ market value to realized value (MVRV) price band at $67,890 indicates the potential for a correction toward the mid-price band at $54,930. Martinez points out that when the MVRV is below the 1-year simple moving average (SMA), it often signals a downtrend. This analysis suggests BTC may experience further downward price pressure due to the heavy distribution near the top. Related Reading: Is Solana A Good Buy? Finance CEO Predicts ‘Magnificent’ Autumn Rally In contrast to Martinez’s bearish outlook, another analyst who goes by the pseudonym “Titan of Crypto” remains bullish on the Bitcoin bull market. The analyst points to the Parabolic SAR indicator and the LMACD (Logarithmic MACD) on the 2-month chart, indicating that the bull market is still intact. According to the analyst, these indicators suggest that BTC’s bullish momentum remains intact. However, the future direction of Bitcoin’s price remains uncertain, with investors cautiously navigating the evolving market conditions. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $64,850, down over 7% in the last seven days alone, demonstrating the bearish sentiment surrounding the Bitcoin market.

In a post on X, Pal said traders may look at loading the coin, citing the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. Looking at the SOLUSDT chart, it is clear that the coin is moving sideways and inside a broader flag after the spike to over $200 in March.

Technically, a close above $190 and preferably $190, could mark the resumption of the next leg up, quashing bears. On-Chain Activity Shrinking As Ethereum Set For More Institutional Support Whether this will pan out in the coming weeks or months is unclear. How SOL performs is primarily tied to market developments and on-chain activity, among other factors. Although Solana is fast emerging as a preferred choice for meme coin issuers, there has been a marked drop in on-chain activity in recent days. Notably, Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism appear to be taking over. Related Reading: Bitcoin Battles $64,515 Support Level, Can It Hold or Will Bears Prevail? Solana offers higher scalability than Ethereum, meaning transaction fees are low. When on-chain activity drops relative to other cheaper platforms, it could mean the demand for SOL is falling, which is a net negative for prices. At the same time, the revival in the stock market, which has seen indices like the S&P 500 rally, could draw investors’ attention to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the brink of approving a spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF), more capital will flow to ETH.

29699732,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625438,1718830858,"Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment Drops To 2024 Lows, What Does This Mean For Price?","The crypto industry is now going through another turbulent period, as evidenced by price data in the past week. Dogecoin, the largest meme cryptocurrency, has particularly led the meme sector in price declines, with most meme coins failing to attract inflows. At the same time, the lacklustre price action has been reflected by a dip in enthusiasm from supporters, according to data analytics. Per data from Santiment, Dogecoin sentiment based on positive mentions across the internet has fallen to its lowest point in 2024. However, while the mood is sour, this could be the best time for traders to scoop up DOGE before the price eventually rebounds. Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment Drops To 2024 Lows Santiment’s data is based on the weighted sentiment for Dogecoin. Basically, the weighted sentiment tracks various social media mentions of cryptocurrencies and classifies them as either positive or negative. On account of its status as a meme coin, the price of Dogecoin is heavily impacted by the weighted sentiment. Related Reading: Shiba Inu To The Moon: Analyst Predicts A Run Above $0.00015 If This Happens Dogecoin’s weighted sentiment is a cycle of ups and downs and always has its moments. Sometimes, on-chain data points to sentiment shooting through the roof. Other times like this, the sentiment is on the downside, with interest waning among retail investors. As Santiment noted, Dogecoin’s weighted sentiment has been on the lower end in the past few days and is currently at its lowest point in 2024. With Dogecoin sentiment hitting new lows, it’s likely the Dogecoin price will continue to slide lower in the short term. However, keeping in mind that the weighted sentiment is bound to reverse to the upside, this presents an opportunity for shrewd investors to buy in before another FOMO kicks in. “Patient traders who have been waiting for the crowd to give up on these large cap altcoins may finally have their buy opportunity with FOMO at a 2024 low,” Santiment noted. Interestingly, this smart investment strategy is further solidified by Dogecoin’s MVRV ratio. The MVRV ratio compares Dogecoin’s market capitalization to the realized value of all Dogecoins in circulation, essentially showing whether the asset is currently overvalued or undervalued. Notably, Santiment data shows that the Dogecoin MVRV ratio has declined steadily over the past 30 days and is currently less than negative -12%. This suggests that the crypto is currently undervalued and is at a price far below its potential. What’s Next For DOGE Price? Given Dogecoin’s history of extreme price volatility and momentum-driven rallies, a shift back to positive sentiment could send the meme coin surging once again. Related Reading: XRP Enters Triangle Formation: Analyst Predicts Rise To $200 Amid 300% Surge In Volume At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1248. Notably, price action indicates that DOGE is starting to reverse seven days of declines with a 2.10% increase in the past 24 hours. Also, the relative strength index (RSI) indicator shows DOGE recently bouncing off the oversold threshold, suggesting that it could continue on an upward trajectory.

However, in a surprising turn of events, the party responsible has been identified as CertiK. This blockchain security firm claims to have initially reported the bug through Kraken’s bug bounty program. CertiK is now accused of exploiting additional vulnerabilities and extorting the exchange for more money, leading to calls for legal action and concerns among crypto investors. Kraken Security Flaws Exposed The incident unfolded when Kraken’s Chief Security Officer, Nick Percoco, revealed that the exchange had received a bug report on June 9 from a self-described security researcher. The researcher claimed to have discovered an “extremely critical” bug that allowed them to inflate their balance on the platform artificially. Upon further investigation, CertiK, which admitted its involvement in the incident in its social media post, uncovered several critical vulnerabilities in Kraken’s systems that could potentially result in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. Related Reading: Whales Dump Over $1 Billion In Bitcoin: Fire Sale Or Foreshadowing? CertiK’s findings revealed shortcomings in Kraken’s deposit system, indicating a failure to differentiate between internal transfer statuses. Furthermore, CertiK’s testing revealed that Kraken failed all these tests, exposing the compromised state of Kraken’s defense-in-depth system. According to CertiK, “millions of dollars” could be deposited into any Kraken account, and a substantial amount of fabricated cryptocurrency (worth over $1 million) could be withdrawn and converted into valid digital assets. The security firm also claimed that no alerts were triggered during a “multi-day test period” and that Kraken only responded and blocked the test accounts days after the incident was officially reported. Following the identification of the vulnerability, CertiK alleges that Kraken’s security operations team “threatened” individual CertiK employees, demanding the repayment of a “mismatched” amount of cryptocurrency within an “unreasonable time frame,” without providing repayment addresses. However, Kraken’s Percoco countered that they had requested a full accounting of the then-unknown company’s activities and the return of the withdrawn funds. Percoco argued that CertiK’s refusal to comply with these requests violated the rules of ethical hacking and bordered on extortion. Will CertiK Face Legal Repercussions? The revelation of this incident has raised surprise and concerns within the cryptocurrency community, leading to calls for legal action against CertiK. One user accused CertiK of stealing the $3 million funds from Kraken, holding it ransom for a bounty, refusing to return the funds, and now transferring the money to Tornado.cash to protect it from potential seizure by authorities. Coinbase’s Director, Conor Grogan, pointed out that Tornado.cash is subject to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions and highlighted CertiK’s US domicile, hinting at potential legal repercussions by US agencies. Market expert Adam Cochran also weighed in, astonished at CertiK’s actions and highlighting the firm’s history of compromised audits. Cochran went further to describe the situation as “Down right criminal.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Takes Control In Market Meltdown, Dominance Climbs To 9-Week Peak The next steps taken by Kraken and potential consequences for CertiK are yet to be seen. However, the involvement of US agencies and potential legal actions loom over the security firm. The unfolding developments in this case will undoubtedly shape the future of bug bounty programs and impact the relationship between cryptocurrency exchanges and security firms.

29695987,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625399,1718823637,"Dogecoin, Cardano “Very Bullish” Based On MVRV: Santiment","The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed that Dogecoin and Cardano are two assets that look “very bullish” according to this metric. Dogecoin & Cardano Currently Have Low 30-Day MVRV Ratios In a new post on X, Santiment has discussed about how some of the top assets in the cryptocurrency sector are looking like right now in terms of the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. The MVRV Ratio is a popular on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the market cap and realized cap for any given coin. The market cap here naturally refers to the simple total valuation of the asset’s supply at the current price. The realized cap is also a method of calculating the valuation of the cryptocurrency, but the twist here is that this model doesn’t take the value of all tokens in circulation the same as the spot price. Rather, this model assumes that the “real” value of any coin is the same as the price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain. Related Reading: Hard To Be “Too Scared Of Bitcoin Price Action,” Says Analyst. Here’s Why Generally, the last transaction can be assumed to be the last point at which the coin changed hands, so the price at its time could be considered to be its current cost basis. As such, the realized cap basically calculates the sum of the cost basis of every coin in circulation. One way to view the model, therefore, is as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have used to purchase the total Bitcoin supply in circulation. Since the MVRV ratio compares the market cap, which represents the value that the investors are holding right now, against this initial investment, its value can tell us about the profit-loss status of the market as a whole. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that reveals the recent trend in the 30-day MVRV ratio of six top coins: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Toncoin (TON), and Cardano (ADA). The 30-day MVRV Ratio only includes the data for the investors who bought their coins within the past month. Thus, its value reflects the profit-loss balance of these new buyers. From the graph, it’s visible that the indicator is at negative levels for all of these assets right now, implying that the 30-day investors would be at a loss. This may not actually be bad, though, as Santiment notes, “the lower a cryptocurrency’s 30-day MVRV is, the higher the likelihood we see a short-term bounce.” At present, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are seeing small negative values, suggesting that these assets may be slightly undervalued. The metric stands at just -0.6% for Toncoin, though, implying that TON is more or less neutral currently. Related Reading: XRP, Dogecoin, & Shiba Inu All See Negative Sentiment: Signal To Buy? Dogecoin and Cardano, on the other hand, stand out with their 30-day MVRV Ratios of -16.7% and -12.6%, respectively. These values are deep enough that Santiment has labelled these coins as “very bullish.” It now remains to be seen how DOGE and ADA develop in the coming days, given this potential positive signal in the MVRV Ratio. DOGE Price Dogecoin has been riding on bearish momentum over the last couple of weeks as its price has now dropped to $0.125.

The analyst suggested that the ETH rise was inevitable and that it was better for traders to go with the tide. Ethereum Is Set To Rise To $10,000 Durden mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Ethereum to $10,000 is the “most asymmetric bet” in crypto today. He further stated that “as annoying as that is, [it’s] just the way the chips have fallen,” suggesting that ETH’s rise to this price level was inevitable. He also hinted that he would bet on ETH regardless of how he felt about the crypto token, as he noted that traders “trade the market” and not their emotions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Drops Below Critical Support Level Following Rejection At $70,000 The analyst suggested that the Spot Ethereum ETFs will be key in ETH’s rise to $10,000. He claimed that Wall Street made great efforts to ensure that the Ethereum ETFs were approved, including changing Ethereum from a security. As such, he believes that these institutional investors will ensure that they make as much money as they can from these funds while pumping Ethereum’s price. Other analysts have also shared similar sentiments to Durden’s as they predict that the Spot Ethereum ETFs will contribute to a massive rally for ETH. Crypto analysts Ash Crypto and Eljaboom also recently predicted that ETH would rise to $10,000 thanks to these funds. Ash Crypto stated that it is just a “matter of time” before Ethereum reaches this price level, with the Spot Ethereum ETFs expected to begin trading soon enough. Crypto analysts Altcoin Daily also previously mentioned that ETH to $10,000 is “programmed” and mentioned the Spot Ethereum ETFs as one of the reasons they believe that the crypto token could rise to this price level. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, these Spot Ethereum ETFs could begin trading by July 2. These funds are expected to contribute to ETH’s parabolic rise because of the significant inflows they could bring into the Ethereum ecosystem. Crypto research firm K33 predicts these funds could attract between $3.1 billion and $4.8 billion in net inflows within the first five months of trading. Why It’s Not Worth Betting Against ETH Durden alluded to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to drop its investigation against ETH to further emphasize why betting on Ethereum was an obvious play. Ethereum developer Consensys revealed in an X post that the Enforcement Division of the SEC had notified them that they were closing the investigation into whether ETH was a security. Related Reading: XRP Enters Triangle Formation: Analyst Predicts Rise To $200 Amid 300% Surge In Volume They added that this means that the SEC would no longer be bringing charges alleging that the sale of ETH is a securities transaction. The SEC’s potential lawsuit against Ethereum was expected to be a major catalyst that could suppress ETH’s price, just like the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which is believed to have had a negative impact on XRP’s price. However, with the SEC opting against bringing charges against Ethereum, ETH’s price looks all set for takeoff as this development adds to the bullish narrative around the crypto token.

CoinDesk staff is off for the federal holiday but we have compiled an abbreviated issue of The Protocol with the latest news headlines on blockchain tech, along with our top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column.  Featuring:  Martin Shkreli and $DJT. Is there a connection to Donald Trump?  Consensys says SEC terminates Ethereum 2.0 securities probe.  Protocol Village highlights: Mysten Labs, Sui, Ronin, Sky Mavis, Axie Infinity, Polygon, Polkadot, Arcana, Minima, McLaren.  CARV's $34M node sale.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Network news  DJT DOX! Martin “Pharma Bro” Shkreli said on Tuesday that he was behind the controversial DJT token in an X space tuned in by thousands of people, days after denying any involvement, as colorfully reported by CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa. The flavor-of-the-week token caused certain crypto enthusiasts to extensively wonder who was behind it after it went viral on Monday for its supposed links to Donald Trump and his son Barron. Blockchain sleuths found that DJT’s Telegram channel appeared to share the same admins as a token supported by Shkreli. Shkreli denied any involvement at the time, while DJT continued to rally. On-chain intelligence firm Arkham posted a $150,000 bounty that would pay out the amount to whoever unveiled the creator of the DJT token. This drew out ZachXBT, one of the most widely followed crypto sleuths on X, to submit his findings to Arkham. According to ZachXBT, that's when Shkreli ""panic"" DM'd him. The DJT token was down 58% in the past 24 hours – apparently due to some panic selling. As of press time there was a donnybrook raging on X over whether Shkreli now owes $100 million on a bet on whether the token was connected in some way to Trump.  GRAY HAT? The crypto exchange Kraken said Wednesday in a tweet thread and blog post that it has contacted law enforcement after ""security researchers"" allegedly exploited a bug to withdraw nearly $3 million from artificially inflated account balances, and then refused to return the sums in accordance with the company's Bug Bounty program. ""This is not white-hat hacking, it is extortion!"" Kraken Chief Security Officer Nick Percoco wrote on X.  IN THE CLEAR: The price of ether (ETH) rose after Consensys disclosed receiving letters from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notifying that the regulator had ended its investigation into the technology incubator company and was not going to recommend an enforcement action against it. The SEC told Consensys, whose products include the MetaMask wallet, it was not bringing any enforcement actions in a pair of letters sent to its law firms on Tuesday. In a blog post, Consensys said the SEC was ""closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.""  TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE. The exploit of UwU Lend on Monday put in motion a series of events that led to Thursday’s multimillion liquidations on DeFi lending giant Curve, representatives for its founder Michael Egorov told CoinDesk over Telegram.  JUST NOT IN THE U.S…. Coinbase, the big crypto exchange, launched support for ""pre-launch markets"" on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced – for users in eligible jurisdictions of the U.S., UK and Canada. ""Once the underlying token is launched on relevant spot exchanges, these contracts seamlessly transition into standard perpetual futures contracts,"" according to a blog post. On Tuesday, Coinbase International Exchange tweeted that the pre-launch market was ""now in full trading mode"" for contracts on EigenLayer's new EIGEN token, which has been airdropped but not unlocked for trading. According to at least one estimate posted on X, the trading implies a fully diluted market capitalization for the EIGEN token at $12.2 billion.  Tether, the company behind the $110 billion stablecoin (USDT), debuted Monday a new token minting platform called Alloy on the Ethereum network that lets users create tokens collateralized by Tether's tokenized gold (XAUT).  Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.

Mysten Labs, the primary developer behind the Sui blockchain, unveiled a developer preview of ""Walrus,"" a new decentralized data-storage and data-availability (DA) platform. According the project documentation, Walrus provides two key benefits: cost-effective blob storage as well as high availability and robustness. ""Data recovery is still possible even if two-thirds of the storage nodes crash or come under adversarial control. Further, availability may be certified efficiently without downloading the full blob,"" the documentation reads.  2. Ronin, a gaming-focused blockchain developed by Sky Mavis, creator of the Axie Infinity play-to-earn game, announced the upcoming launch of a new zkEVM, which is an Ethereum-compatible zero-knowledge rollup network. It will be built with a Sky Mavis-modified version of the open-sourced Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK), according to a press release: ""By building a dedicated ZK blockchain, the Ronin network will be able to serve infinitely more users, supporting the rapid growth of its thriving game studio partners and further enhancing the permissionless environment to onboard more gaming experiences.

29692054,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625442,1718816414,Whales Dump Over $1 Billion In Bitcoin: Fire Sale Or Foreshadowing?,"Bitcoin seems to be hitting an air pocket. Over the past two weeks, whales have been shedding their digital assets in large amounts. This exodus, totaling over $1.2 billion according to CryptoQuant, has been a cause for concern for many landlocked investor. Related Reading: Analyst’s Bullish Call: Bitcoin Primed For Massive Jump To $127,000 Where The Whales Go, The Market May Follow The reasons for this sudden sell-off remain murky, but analysts point to a confluence of factors. One theory suggests a shift in priorities for miners, the brawny machines that secure the Bitcoin network and earn rewards in the form of new coins. #Bitcoin long-term holder whales sold $1.2B in the past 2 weeks, likely through brokers. ETF netflows are negative with $460M outflows in the same period. If this ~$1.6B in sell-side liquidity isn’t bought OTC, brokers may deposit $BTC to exchanges, impacting the market. pic.twitter.com/oYeKsRqKeF — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) June 18, 2024 With the booming artificial intelligence (AI) sector offering a potentially more lucrative goldmine, miners might be cashing out their crypto rewards to invest in the future of computing. The allure of AI is undeniable, shared Lucy Hu, a senior analyst at crypto fund Metalpha. The sheer processing power needed for AI development aligns perfectly with the capabilities of mining rigs. It seems miners are strategically diversifying their revenue streams. This potential exodus of miners from the Bitcoin ecosystem could have a domino effect. As miners sell their rewards, it increases the overall supply of BTC in circulation, potentially driving the price down. This aligns with the observed decline in “UTXO age” – a metric used to track buying and selling patterns. A drop in UTXO age indicates increased selling activity, and that’s not a comforting sign for investors hoping to ride the Bitcoin wave. Traditional Markets Beckon, Leaving Bitcoin On The Beach Adding fuel to the fire is the broader market sentiment. The recent strength of the US dollar and a general flight towards “safer” assets like traditional stocks have put a damper on riskier investments like Bitcoin. This risk aversion is further reflected in the net outflows of over $600 million from US-listed Bitcoin ETFs – the worst performance since late April. Related Reading: Altcoin Massacre? Prices Plummet 40-90%, Recovery Stalled — Analyst Is This A Bitcoin Bust, Or A Temporary Hiccup? The combined effect of these factors has been a steady decline in BTC’s price. From a lofty perch of $71,000 just a few weeks ago, Bitcoin has dipped to a little over $65,000. Some analysts warn of a potential freefall to as low as $60,000 if the tide of negative sentiment continues to flow. Whales are unloading a ton of Bitcoin. Is this a fire sale, a big discount to buy Bitcoin, or a warning sign that things are about to get rough for Bitcoin? Investors are waiting to see if this is a good time to buy or if they should get out before the price drops even more.

42408039,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8rq5,1718815907,Why You Should Diversify Your Digital Asset Portfolio,"Digital assets may be one of the few markets where diversification still seems underappreciated. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant by market cap despite a growing number of innovative new projects, and many investment products provide only a handful of concentrated positions.  At Outerlands Capital we have written about the benefit to risk-adjusted returns from diversification. Individually, smaller projects may carry higher risk, but investing across a broad mix of projects can reduce volatility and improve risk-return metrics like the Sharpe ratio (returns normalized for volatility). However, there’s more to diversification than higher Sharpe ratios.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  In a market as dynamic as crypto, diversification is essential to gain exposure to the varied and evolving mix of themes and sectors built around blockchain technology. Diversification is about solving for the power law distribution of returns, whereby a portfolio’s return is driven by a small number of highly positive outcomes against a larger number of investments that deliver lower, or negative, returns. This phenomenon is well documented in venture capital (VC) investing, and the concept carries over to digital asset investments, which are akin to investments in disruptive tech startups. Diversifying makes sure your portfolio has enough shots-on-goal to capture the biggest winners over time.  A concentrated portfolio of just a handful of tokens will struggle to capture the range of exciting crypto use-cases being developed today. Take, for example, the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization – a popular take on a ready-made “diversified” portfolio. You have here, essentially, a mix of currencies and Layer 1s. While these larger tokens are sometimes seen as less risky on account of scale, such a selection fails to capture much of the current innovation happening in crypto.  Expand to an actively managed portfolio encompassing tokens from the Top 150 by market cap and you start to see a much more dynamic picture, spanning Layer 1s and related infrastructure (like scaling solutions and interoperability), DeFi (from trading and lending to asset management), entertainment (including gaming and the metaverse), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN, including projects for distributed compute power with tie-ins to AI), real-world-assets (RWAs), and more. While some of these projects may carry greater risk on their own, diversification helps manage the risk of the overall portfolio.  Portfolios should be positioned to capture emerging themes and new directions as projects across the space continue to innovate, searching for product-market-fit. Even in the more developed parts of the crypto ecosystem, such as payments or Layer 1s, we believe it is still much too early to call winners. The pace of innovation means disruption will continue to be the norm.  The nascency of the market and its fast-paced evolution also mean that an active approach to portfolio management is imperative: Diversified is not equal to passive. Building a well diversified portfolio does not mean just buying more, smaller assets. It means taking a long-term perspective on the scale and scope of the digital assets ecosystem, and positioning a portfolio to take advantage of the many different potential outcomes.  Coming out of crypto conferences like Consensus, AIMA Digital Assets, Token2049, and DAS, we are again emboldened in our assessment that the average institutional crypto portfolio is simply not exposed to enough of the disruptive use-cases being tested in digital assets today. Budding themes such as DePIN, innovative scaling solutions for Ethereum and also Bitcoin, and bringing real-world-assets on-chain all require a deep look past the largest tokens, and should encourage portfolios of digital assets spanning many sectors and project sizes.  Remember that diversifying doesn’t make a portfolio less potent - it actually gives investors more opportunities to capture winners, while still providing time-tested risk benefits. In essence, diversification gives you more for less.  Disclosure: The information herein is for general information purposes only and is not investment advice.

42408030,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8rPd,1718813799,Crypto's Long-Tail Disruptive Trends,"The first half of 2024 has started a new cycle for the crypto’s adoption. The long awaited approval of Bitcoin ETFs was a decisive factor for this new cycle, along with strong price momentum that led to bitcoin reaching a new all-time high. This not only pushed bitcoin to the doorstep of institutional adoption again, but it also positioned the market for another potential bull market cycle.  These cycles have been marked not only by the introduction of new projects, from Bittensor and ZKSync, to Bonk and Dogwifhat, but also by strong price appreciation of many digital assets. With a higher beta compared to bitcoin, assets of varying sizes and sectors often experience greater volatility, reflecting investors' expectations of higher returns.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Several trends are shaping the altcoin market in 2024 that signify a focus on innovation, sustainability, and exploration of new use cases, driving growth among altcoins.  Re-staking has emerged as a notable vertical for this new cycle, which involves continuously staking the rewards earned from staking tokens, compounding the returns over time. Projects like EigenLayer (EIGEN), EtherFi (ETHFI), and Renzo (REZ) have implemented mechanisms that encourage users to restake their staking rewards, thereby increasing their stake in the network and contributing to its security and stability.  Altcoins are increasingly adopting Layer2 scaling solutions such as Optimistic Rollups, zkRollups and side-chains to improve transaction speeds and reduce fees. Projects in this category include Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Polygon (MATIC), Starknet (STRK), among many others. This trend aims to enhance user experience and attract more users to these projects’ platforms.  Interoperability between blockchain networks is also a growing trend. Some projects are collaborating and building bridges to enable asset transfers and communication across disparate blockchains. This trend aims to create a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem instead of many different siloed blockchains. Examples of such projects include Axelar (AXL), Across (ACX) and Stargate (STG).  With the rise of Layer 2 solutions and interoperability, modular blockchains represent the next phase of digital assets’ evolution. With their adaptable and customizable design, these offer a flexible framework where developers can plug-and-play modules like consensus mechanisms, token standards and governance models. Blockchains such as Celestia (TIA) and Dymension (DYM) are using this modularity to enhance scalability, interoperability and security.  Parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) break down smart contract execution into parallel tasks, harnessing the power of multiple nodes simultaneously. The most popular parallelized EVMs, such as Sei (SEI), Canto (CANTO), Nomad, and NeonEVM (NEON), are attempting to do this by processing transactions off-chain, then aggregating them back onto the Ethereum mainnet. This approach drastically improves transaction throughput and reduces latency, addressing Ethereum's historic limitations.  Current crypto market prices seem to indicate that a bull market is underway, mega caps may still have room to grow before smaller coins outperform the rest of the market. However, this phase may not be far off and, once it begins, being under-positioned could be difficult and potentially costly, especially as institutional adoption grows and the need to generate alpha increases.

With $109 million still on-hand, the fund is among the nation's largest for the 2024 election.  Jump Crypto put another $10 million into the U.S. political action committee (PAC) that's seeking to rush as many pro-crypto members into Congress as possible to achieve legislation the industry is after, a spokesman for the PAC confirmed.  The total of $15 million from Jump, a Chicago-based investment firm, means almost $169 million so far has been amassed by Fairshake and its affiliated PACs as of Wednesday, according to spokesman Josh Vlasto, giving the young industry one of the most potent campaign-finance operations in the 2024 elections. The so-called super PACs have been flooding primaries with large-scale ad spending and seeing many of its favored candidates cruising toward what will be likely general-election wins in November.  ""The crypto and blockchain communities have truly come together to form a sustainable bipartisan coalition and an effective operation that is built for the long term,"" Vlasto said in a statement. ""We will continue to support candidates who are committed to getting things done and working with the industry to pass responsible regulation that drives innovation, creates jobs, and sustains America’s global leadership.""  A spokeswoman for Jump declined to comment on the donation. The company's eight-digit addition follows a recent series of matching $25-million follow-up donations from big crypto firms Coinbase Inc. (COIN), Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).  Fairshake and its brethren (two PACs called Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress) were still holding onto $109 million as of the May 31 filing with the Federal Election Commission, Vlasto said, with less than five months to go before the final voting. The spokesman confirmed the PAC has no plans to support presidential candidates, so the aim is to find proven congressional incumbents and crypto-friendly candidates.  The sitting members of Congress are suddenly more easy to evaluate on that score. Previously, there weren't a lot of practical measures of crypto support to help grade politicians in the House of Representatives and Senate, but both chambers have now been through votes on digital assets efforts.  In May, the House passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) that's the first wide-reaching crypto oversight legislation to clear either of the chambers of Congress. Its chances in the Senate are limited – depending on whether key lawmakers can somehow package it with a must-pass bill. But a side bonus for the industry was that it immediately learned which of the 435 members of the House are pulling for crypto regulations.  Also in May, both chambers voted to reverse a contentious Securities and Exchange Commission crypto account policy, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). The effort was smacked down by a veto from President Joe Biden, but it revealed 11 Democrats in the Senate were willing to join Republicans in bucking the SEC policy and the White House's preference.  Both efforts saw a higher-than-expected showing of support from Democrats, and the tallies are being used to assess lawmakers. Stand With Crypto, an advocacy group started by Coinbase, maintains a grading system for politicians. The ""D"" grade for Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), for instance, reflects his no vote on the SAB 121 resolution, while the ""B"" grade for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) shows he was for it.  ""Recent votes have helped us educate our advocates on where politicians stand on crypto,"" said Sabrina Siddiqui, a spokesman for the group, in a statement. She said Stand With Crypto reached more than a million online members several months earlier than anticipated because ""people were coalescing behind these key votes.""

29689188,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625431,1718811052,Ikigai Founder Explains Why Bitcoin And Crypto Are ‘On The Verge Of Cannibalism’,"Travis Kling, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Ikigai Asset Management, shared his insights on the current state of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, which he described as following: “Bitcoin is ~10% off of ATHs and the timeline appears to be on the verge of cannibalism.” In a series of detailed posts on X, Kling dissected the complex interplay of macroeconomic factors, ETF flows, and internal market dynamics that are shaping the cryptocurrency markets. Why Is Bitcoin Trading Flat? Kling began his analysis by addressing Bitcoin’s performance relative to the broader macroeconomic environment. Despite the NASDAQ surging 16% since April 19, following a low induced by market trepidations about rate cuts, Bitcoin has notably underperformed, remaining relatively flat. Kling pointed out, “BTC is trading pretty crappy relative to macro.” This underperformance is particularly striking given that during this period, the US equity markets have repeatedly set new all-time highs, while Bitcoin has stagnated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Month-Long Rally Comes To An End: Price Plunges Below $65,000 – What’s Next For BTC? A significant part of Kling’s analysis focused on the dynamics of US spot Bitcoin ETFs. Starting May 13, the market witnessed 19 consecutive days of robust ETF inflows, totaling approximately $4 billion. Surprisingly, these substantial inflows only resulted in a 17% increase in Bitcoin’s price, which Kling argues is underwhelming. He noted, “It’s true BTC was +17% over this period, but why not more? Why not meaningfully higher highs?” This question points to underlying issues in market structure or investor sentiment that might be damping the expected bullish response to inflow surges. Moreover, recent ETF outflows have coincided with a 7% drop in Bitcoin’s price over a similar period, further complicating the narrative around ETF impacts. Kling suggests that while ETF inflows and outflows are significant, they might not fully capture the underlying market dynamics, indicating a complex interplay of arbitrage opportunities and market sentiment. “I think one thing we can say with confidence is that the ETFs have a lot of arb flow in them. Just look at the 13Fs. There’s NAV arb and then that gets laid off into futures and spot and then there’s the same basis trade that’s always been present in this market,” Kling wrote. He also speculated about external factors affecting Bitcoin’s price, such as potential government sales of Bitcoin confiscated during the Silk Road operation. Although he admits lacking concrete proof, Kling aligns his hypothesis with the timing of certain market movements and known government actions. Additionally, he highlighted the influence of Ethereum on Bitcoin’s market dynamics, particularly during a week of significant activity around an Ethereum ETF, which saw the largest weekly ETH to BTC volume on record since a previous peak. What To Expect From Ether And Altcoins? Despite Ethereum’s influence on Bitcoin, ETH itself faces challenges. The anticipation surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs has not translated into sustained positive price action. Ethereum remains 30% below its all-time high, with upcoming ETFs potentially being a critical factor. Kling posits, “If [Ethereum ETF inflows] are strong, ETH likely rips hard. If they’re weak, ETH may sell off.” The uncertainty about the strength of these inflows and their market impact reflects broader market anxieties. Related Reading: Hard To Be “Too Scared Of Bitcoin Price Action,” Says Analyst. Here’s Why The broader altcoin market is also suffering, with many tokens significantly off their highs and struggling to find a footing. Kling’s remarks about the altcoin sector are particularly stark: “The airdrop meta has been dying a slow death for months. Alts are overwhelmed with token unlocks from holders that are up many multiples and will hammer a nonexistent bid.” This scenario illustrates the difficulties facing smaller altcoins as they navigate a market dominated by major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In conclusion, Kling’s comprehensive analysis suggests a cryptocurrency market at a critical juncture, facing internal competition and macroeconomic mismatches that could define its trajectory in the coming months. “So overall that’s what has the timeline acting like prices are 75% lower than they are right now. BTC is probably heading higher this year. ETH is probably somewhere between fine and gangbusters this year, based on ETH ETF inflows. But the gap between BTC/ETH and everything else is wide and likely going to get wider this year. If crypto can muster up even a modicum of a legit narrative that can drive real inflows into Alts, it can all change in a hurry. But the current slate of ‘narratives’ is unlikely to get that done,” Kling concluded. At press time, BTC traded at $65,138.

42408028,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8rJ1,1718810534,Kraken Says Hackers Turned to 'Extortion' After Exploiting Bug for $3M,"Kraken said third-party security researchers found a vulnerability, which was fixed by the crypto exchange.  The researchers secretly withdrew nearly $3 million and refused to give it back without seeing the bounty amount first, Kraken said.  Blockchain code editor Certik said it found a vulnerability in Kraken's platform and claims to have been ""threatened"" by the exchange.  Crypto exchange Kraken said ""security researchers"" who found a vulnerability on the platform turned to ""extortion"" after withdrawing about $3 million from the exchange's treasury.  Nick Percoco, Kraken's chief security officer, said in a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the firm received a ""bug bounty program"" alert from a security researcher on June 9 about a vulnerability that allows users to artificially inflate their balance. The bug ""allowed a malicious attacker, under the right circumstances, to initiate a deposit onto our platform and receive funds in their account without fully completing the deposit,"" Percoco added.  Upon receiving the report, Kraken fixed the issue swiftly and no user funds were affected, Percoco noted.  What came after raised red flags for Kraken's team.  The security researcher, upon finding the bug, allegedly disclosed it to two other individuals, who then ""fraudulently"" withdrew nearly $3 million from their Kraken accounts. ""This was from Kraken’s treasuries, not other client assets,"" Percoco said.  The initial bug report didn't mention the two other individuals' transactions, and when Kraken asked for more details of their activities, they refused.  ""Instead, they demanded a call with their business development team (i.e. their sales reps) and have not agreed to return any funds until we provide a speculated $ amount that this bug could have caused if they had not disclosed it. This is not white-hat hacking, it is extortion!"" Percoco wrote.  Kraken didn't disclose who the researchers were, but blockchain code editor Certik subsequently said in a social media post that it found several vulnerabilities in the crypto exchange.  Certik said it conducted ""multi-day testing"" and noted that the bug could be exploited to create millions of dollars worth of crypto. ""Millions of dollars can be deposited to ANY Kraken account. A huge amount of fabricated crypto (worth more than 1M+ USD) can be withdrawn from the account and converted into valid cryptos. Worse yet, no alerts were triggered during the multi-day testing period,"" the post said.  However, Certik said things went sour after the initial conversation with Kraken. ""Kraken’s security operation team has THREATENED individual CertiK employees to repay a MISMATCHED amount of crypto in an UNREASONABLE time even WITHOUT providing repayment addresses,"" the X post added.  Bug bounty programs – used by many firms to strengthen their security systems – invite third-party hackers, known as ""white hats,"" to find vulnerabilities so the company can fix them before a malicious actor exploits them. Kraken's competitor, Coinbase, has a similar program to help alert the exchange of vulnerabilities.  To be paid the bounty, Kraken's program requires a third party to find the problem, exploit the minimum amount needed to prove the bug, return the assets and provide details of the vulnerability, Kraken said in a blog post, adding that since the security researchers didn't follow these rules, they won't get the bounty.  ""We engaged these researchers in good faith and, in-line with a decade of running a bug bounty program, had offered a sizable bounty for their efforts. We’re disappointed by this experience and are now working with law enforcement agencies to retrieve the assets from these security researchers,"" a Kraken spokesperson told CoinDesk.

Finance CEO Predicts ‘Magnificent’ Autumn Rally,"Raoul Pal, the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Real Vision, a financial media platform, has indicated that Solana is on the brink of reversing its bearish trends. The financial expert has predicted a “magnificent autumn rally” for the cryptocurrency in this market cycle. Solana To Witness Major Autumn Rally Solana’s recent downward trend could potentially signal a great buying opportunity for investors who remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s future outlook. Being a popular supporter and long-term investor of Solana, Pal has expressed confidence in the cryptocurrency’s ability to witness a major price increase soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Drops Below Critical Support Level Following Rejection At $70,000 In an X (formerly Twitter) post on June 18, Pal highlighted Solana’s present market dynamics, sharing a detailed price chart of the cryptocurrency, depicting its price movements from July 2023 to July 2024. The analyst described Solana’s price actions as a “banana” that was slowly “ripening,” emphasizing the cryptocurrency’s steady rise to peak value. He also underscored the cryptocurrency’s significant growth potential and performance amidst market downtrends, highlighting Solana’s ability to witness a “magnificent” rally in the upcoming autumn season. In this context, the autumn season signifies a cryptocurrency season characterized by a surge in market capitalization followed by initial signs of market weakness, as investors take profits and volatility increases. Typically, crypto autumn precedes the winter season which is the harshest period in the market where bears attack and cryptocurrency prices fall dramatically. Pal has suggested that investors who wish to add more SOL to their existing holdings can do so during this period to take advantage of potential buying opportunities. He portrayed Solana’s present price as a prime entry point for crypto investors to position themselves before an impending rally. However, a few crypto community members expressed skepticism about Pal’s predictions, including crypto analyst, Jerry Jordan who queried about the timeline for this projected “banana season.” Responding to Jordan’s comment, Pal acknowledged that while a banana season for Solana was inevitable, ongoing market volatility makes the timeline for its projected surge uncertain. He emphasized that Solana will need to break out of its current sideways consolidation before it can witness a significant price increase. Sharing Pal’s bullish sentiments for Solana, popular crypto analyst, Ali Martinez has disclosed a key support zone at $141 for the cryptocurrency.

As well as introducing greater utility to Bitcoin, Anduro may present an opportunity for further revenue streams for miners, hence Marathon's involvement.  Anduro, a multi-chain layer-2 network incubated by bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), has incorporated the decentralized exchange (DEX) network Portal to Bitcoin – formerly known simply as Portal – with the goal of enhancing utility on the world's oldest blockchain network.  Publicly-traded Marathon began incubating Anduro in February as a ""platform built on the Bitcoin network that allows for the creation of multiple sidechains.""  The integration with a San Francisco-based fintech provider DEX network coincides with a renaming of the project to Portal to Bitcoin, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk on Wednesday.  The company formerly known as Portal raised a $34 million seed round in March, and uses the Bitcoin layer-2 network Lightning to allow users to convert assets like ETH into BTC by the use of atomic swaps - peer-to-peer transactions where cryptocurrencies can be exchanged on different blockchains.  Such practice is commonplace between Ethereum-based assets and on other blockchains, but is a far more recent development on Bitcoin.  As well as introducing greater utility to Bitcoin, Anduro may present an opportunity for further revenue streams for miners; hence Marathon's involvement.  Anduro’s sidechains use a process called merge-mining, whereby participating miners could earn Bitcoin-denominated revenue from transactions that occur on these chains while continuing to mine bitcoin on the base-layer.

Related Reading: Altcoin Massacre? Prices Plummet 40-90%, Recovery Stalled — Analyst This shift has resulted in Bitcoin’s dominance climbing to a nine-week high of 57%. Amidst the market chaos, Bitcoin has emerged as a beacon of relative stability, while altcoins are bearing the brunt of the sell-off. Flight To Safety: Bitcoin’s Rising Dominance In times of market uncertainty, investors often gravitate towards what they perceive as safer assets. This behavior is evident in the recent crypto market dynamics, where Bitcoin has become the preferred choice for investors looking to weather the storm. The broader market sell-off, which saw a staggering $110 billion in market value vanish in just one week, has particularly impacted altcoins. Projects such as Akash Network, Floki, and Chiliz have experienced significant declines, each plummeting over 30%. The Appeal Of Bitcoin Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its established track record and perceived stability compared to newer, more volatile altcoins. This perception has driven many investors to seek refuge in Bitcoin, while altcoins are left exposed to harsh market conditions. This shift in preference underscores a broader belief that Bitcoin offers a safer haven during periods of market distress. Long-Term Perspective On Bitcoin’s Dominance Despite Bitcoin’s current dominance, some analysts advise caution. Jelle, a seasoned crypto trader, suggests that Bitcoin’s dominance might not be sustainable in the long run. #Bitcoin dominance continues to lose steam as price consolidates right below all-time highs. Almost as if #Altcoins will outperform as soon as BTC breaks out. Almost. pic.twitter.com/tjVOaUHskm — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) June 17, 2024 He argues that altcoins, with their innovative features and potential for significant growth, could reclaim their lost ground once Bitcoin surpasses its previous all-time high of $74,000. This perspective highlights the cyclical nature of the crypto market, where different assets can outperform at different times. Market Sentiment And Future Prospects The broader market’s current downturn has led to a bearish sentiment, with Bitcoin struggling to maintain its footing within a crucial support zone around $64,500. The prevailing sentiment is one of caution, as the market grapples with uncertainty. However, there are glimmers of hope on the horizon. Interestingly, while the crypto market has been experiencing a decline, tech stocks have been performing well, marking their seventh consecutive day of gains. This divergence suggests that the current downturn might be specific to the crypto market rather than indicative of a broader economic malaise. Volatility And Potential Reversals The notorious volatility of the crypto market means that swift reversals are always a possibility. Historically, digital assets have been prone to dramatic swings, and what goes down can just as quickly go back up. Related Reading: Metrics Signal Bitcoin Price Increase – But When Is Anyone’s Guess This inherent volatility is both a risk and an opportunity for investors. The recent uptick in the Fear & Greed Index to 64 indicates that despite the sell-off, some investors remain optimistic, exhibiting a degree of irrational exuberance.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The digital asset market ticked upward during the European morning with ether reclaiming $3,500. ETH has climbed over 4% in the last 24 hours, trading at $3,540 at the time of writing. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) added around 1.6%. DOGE is nearly 3.5% higher following its slump on Tuesday, while fellow meme coin SHIB is also up over 3%. Bitcoin remains subdued, trading around $65,400, a lift of 0.2% from 24 hours ago. Spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. experienced a further $152.4 million worth of outflows on Tuesday.  Wallets tracked by CryptoQuant show whales sold over $1.2 billion worth of BTC in the past two weeks. These long-term bitcoin holders are displaying few signs of renewed demand, indicating an ongoing absence of upside for the world's largest cryptocurrency. “Traders are still not increasing their bitcoin holdings and large holders’ demand growth is still missing strength,” analysts wrote. Market observers say crypto miners may be increasingly looking at the booming AI sector instead of bitcoin to ply their trade, prompting a sale of their bitcoin rewards instead of holding. Both sectors rely extensively on powerful computing chips to generate and maintain data.  Bitcoin and crypto-linked stocks are underrated and ripe for institutional adoption, according to broker Bernstein. While BTC and bitcoin ETFs may have shown promise before disappointingin recent months, Bernstein predicts ETF approval by major wirehouses and large private bank platforms in the second half of the year. Bitcoin ETF inflows are expected to accelerate in the third and fourth quarters, the report said, and the next leg of adoption will be driven by large advisers approving ETFs and allocation headroom from existing portfolios. Bernstein has outperform ratings for bitcoin-adjacent publicly traded firms like MicroStrategy, Robinhood and miners Riot Platforms and CleanSpark.  Chart of the Day  Cumulative open interest in bitcoin perpetual futures trading on major exchanges has declined from $6.07 billion to $5.10 billion in two weeks.  It means the recent bitcoin price pullback is mainly driven by unwinding of bullish bets or profit taking rather than renewed bearish bets.

42408038,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8rgA,1718795987,Bitcoin Whales Sold Over $1B BTC in Past Two Weeks: CryptoQuant,"Long-term bitcoin holders and miners have been significant sellers of the cryptocurrency in the past two weeks with little indication of renewed buying interest.  This trend has been observed through a decrease in UTXO age bands, indicating increased selling activity.  Some opine miners are shifting their focus to the booming AI sector due to the diminishing mining rewards post-halving, which may have increased selling activity.  Long-term bitcoin holders and miners were among the biggest sellers of the asset in the past two weeks and show few signs of renewed demand, on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant said in a Wednesday report shared with CoinDesk.  Wallets tracked by CryptoQuant show whales – a colloquial term for large holders of any token – sold over $1.2 billion worth of BTC in the past two weeks, likely using brokers instead of on the open market.  “Traders are still not increasing their Bitcoin holdings and large holders’ (whales) demand growth is still missing strength,” analysts wrote. “Stablecoin liquidity has continued to slow down, growing at the slowest pace since November 2023.”  These traders have decreased their holdings since BTC prices traded over $70,000 in late May, declining UTXO age bands tracked by CryptoQuant show.  Unspent output from bitcoin transactions, or UTXO, are created in every Bitcoin transaction is used by traders to track buying and selling patterns in the previous, current and upcoming market cycles. A drop in UTXO age usually indicates an increase in Bitcoin activity, and thus selling. A rise suggests more holding in the market.  Market observers say miners may be increasingly looking at the booming artificial intelligence (AI) sector instead of bitcoin to ply their trade, leading to selling their bitcoin rewards instead of holding. Both sectors extensively rely on powerful computing chips to generate and maintain data—a resource that miners already possess.  ""One of the biggest trends since Bitcoin halving this year is that miners are increasingly diverting to AI business,"" shared Lucy Hu, senior analyst at crypto wealth management company Metalpha in a Telegram message. ""The fall of the mining rewards prompted miners to seek other channels to boost revenue. With AI firms demanding energy-intensive data centers, Bitcoin miners are gradually growing revenue from the sales with AI firms.""  Since June 5, BTC prices have fallen from $71,000 to just over $65,000 as of Wednesday on a strong dollar, a flight away from riskier assets, and growth in traditional stock indices. Meanwhile, U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the asset recorded net outflows of over $600 million last week—their worst performance since late April.  Some traders have warned of a move to as low as $60,000 in the absence of growth catalysts.  BTC is down 0.6% in the past 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows.

42408040,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8rtO,1718795542,Elevated Ether Volatility Expectations May Be Unfounded,"The spread between ether and bitcoin implied volatility indexes has widened, reflecting excitement about the potential debut of spot ETH ETFs in the U.S.  Volatility pricing may be off the mark because institutions might use the spot ETFs to set up non-directional basis trades, as they have been reportedly doing in BTC.  Demand for ether ETFs may be tepid.  Spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to begin trading in the U.S. this year. The highly anticipated debut has investors positioning for higher volatility in the ether {{ETH}} price relative to bitcoin {{BTC}}.  There's a possibility that the excitement about spot ether ETFs may be unfounded, one observer suggested.  The spread between the forward-looking, 30-day implied volatility indexes for ether (ETH DVOL) and bitcoin (BTC DVOL) flipped positive in April on dominant crypto options exchange Deribit. Since then, it has risen to 17%, according to data tracked by Amberdata. Implied volatility estimates the degree of future price swings based on options prices.  In other words, ether's implied volatility has been consistently greater than bitcoin's for over two months. This richness may not persist, according to Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata.  ""I continue to remain skeptical that this relative volatility premium remains persistent. A lot of cold water was splashed on the BTC ETF Inflows narrative, given the speculation that funds are merely trading the BTC basis as opposed to taking outright ETF exposure,"" Magadini said in the weekly newsletter.  Much of the excitement over spot ether ETFs probably stems from the fact that bitcoin ETFs have drawn nearly $15 billion in investor money since their debut in January.  Initially, BTC's price surged alongside ETF inflows. That rally has now stalled, with industry experts attributing most ETF inflows to a non-directional arbitrage strategy – the cash and carry, or basis, trade – instead of outright bullish bets.  That has toned down the bullish spot ETF narrative. After all, institutions might use spot ether ETFs to set up basis trades.  ""If this is true, does the ETH ETF truly react aggressively to the start of an ETF trading? Especially by such a large margin across the board in the term structure,"" Magadini wrote.  Term structure is a graphical representation of implied volatility for different maturities and is usually upward-sloping: greater volatility is expected in the longer term. Ether's term structure is significantly higher than bitcoin's, indicating heightened expectations for volatility across all time frames.  There's another sign the market might be a little too excited about spot ether ETFs: Open interest in ether futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is significantly less than bitcoin futures. The figure for ether futures is $1.6 billion compared with almost $10 billion in bitcoin futures, according to Velo Data.  The discrepancy shows ether has yet to find the institutional acceptance of bitcoin, and inflows into the impending ether ETFs could be tepid compared with the larger cryptocurrency. Investment banking giant JPMorgan warned last month that ether ETFs may amass just $3 billion in net inflows this year.  ""The true resolution to this question [about persistent of ether vol premium] comes when we see the actual ETF inflows and volume. If this looks anything like the CME OI between BTC futures and ETH futures, I think ETH still doesn’t have the mainstream enthusiasm that BTC has seen,"" Magadini said.  ""Longterm I still love ETH, but there seems to be a trading opportunity around the 'immediate' ETH relative vol pricing today,"" Magadini added.  Volatility trading involves betting on the degree of price swings. Investors typically sell options or volatility futures when anticipating a slide in the implied volatility.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/19/elevated-ether-volatility-expectations-may-be-unfounded,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af5533562893e00a029eaace0996b96eacade301-1905x1072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

29680091,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625386,1718793033,"Bitcoin Battles $64,515 Support Level, Can It Hold or Will Bears Prevail?","Bitcoin current position at the $64,515 support level has sparked significant interest among traders and analysts. This key threshold is seen as a critical juncture that could dictate the cryptocurrency’s near-term trajectory. On the one hand, bullish proponents argue that robust fundamentals and renewed investor interest could propel Bitcoin higher. On the other hand, bearish sentiment driven by macroeconomic pressures and regulatory uncertainties suggests a potential crash. With a market capitalization of more than $1.2 trillion and a trading volume of more than $34 billion as of the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is up by 0.04%, trading at around $65,621 in the last 24 hours. BTC market cap and trading volume are currently down by 0.66%% and 6.05% respectively. Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Chart Patterns And Indicators This analysis delves into weighing the bullish and bearish scenarios in other to determine Bitcoin’s future price actions. Bitcoin’s price on the 4-hour chart is currently making a retracement after a rejection at the $64,515 support level and it’s still trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Although it seems like the price is moving toward the $66,736 level, this may only be a short-term move as it may drop down again. Also, it can be observed that both the signal line and SMA of the Composite Trend Oscillator indicator are still struggling in the oversold section suggesting further future decline in the price of BTC. From the 1-day chart, BTC’s price, having successfully dropped below the 100-day SMA with strong bearish momentum, is making a short-term pullback. After this pullback, the flagship crypto may begin to drop again toward the $64,515 support level. Furthermore, it can be observed here that both the signal line and SMA of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator are attempting to drop below the zero line. With this current formation, it can be suggested that BTC’s price may go bearish in the long run. Weighing The Bullish And Bearish Cases Currently, there are four key support levels and three key resistance levels to look out for in the images used in this article. If the price of Bitcoin continues bearish as predicted, it will start to move downward toward the $64,515 support level to retest it. In the event of a break below this level, BTC will decline further to test the $60,158 level and possibly other support levels.

Spot bitcoin ETFs will be approved by major wirehouses and large private bank platforms in the third and fourth quarters, the report said.  Bernstein predicts that bitcoin will reach a cycle high of $200,000 in 2025, $500,000 by 2029 and $1 million by 2033.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} and crypto-linked stocks are underrated and ripe for institutional adoption, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Wednesday.  Bernstein notes that crypto bears have argued that the spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) trade is over, that most of the early allocations were from retail investors, and that the majority of institutional demand was for the “basis cash and carry trade” and not new net long positions.  While this is true, “we see bitcoin ETFs as on the cusp of approvals at major wirehouses and large private bank platforms in Q3/Q4,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Maihka Sapra wrote. Spot bitcoin ETFs were approved for the first time in the U.S. in January, dramatically broadening access to the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.  The institutional basis trade appears to be the “Trojan horse for adoption” and these investors are now evaluating net long positions as they become more comfortable with improving ETF liquidity, the authors wrote. The basis trade involves buying the spot bitcoin ETF and selling the bitcoin futures contract at the same time and then waiting for the prices to converge.  Bitcoin ETF inflows are expected to accelerate in the third and fourth quarters, the report said, and the next leg of adoption will be driven by large advisers approving ETFs and allocation headroom from existing portfolios.  The broker expects bitcoin to rise to a cycle high of around $200,000 by 2025, $500,000 by 2029 and $1 million by 2033.  Bernstein has an outperform rating on bitcoin miners Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK).

The ether price rose after the news.  The price of ether {{ETH}} rose after Consensys received letters from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) saying the regulator had ended its investigation into the technology incubator company and was not going to recommend an enforcement action against it.  The SEC told Consensys, whose products include the MetaMask wallet, it was not bringing any enforcement actions in a pair of letters sent to its law firms on Tuesday. In a blog post, Consensys said the SEC was ""closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.""  The letters had the subject line ""Re: In the Matter of Ethereum 2.0 (C-08950),"" but did not otherwise explicitly mention the blockchain associated with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  ""We have concluded the investigation in the above-referenced matter,"" one letter said. ""Based on the information we have as of this date, we do not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the Commission against your client, Consensys Software Inc.""  The letter said that while it's announcing the conclusion of an investigation, that should not be taken to mean there will never be an enforcement action.  ""The Commission is instructing its staff that in cases where such action appears appropriate, it may advise a person under inquiry that its formal investigation has been terminated. Such action on the part of the staff will be purely discretionary on its part for the reasons mentioned above. Even if such advice is given, however, it must in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff’s investigation of that particular matter,"" the letter said, citing a Wells Notice explainer on the SEC website.  A second letter echoed the language about concluding an investigation, while also saying it did not agree with any factual statements or legal conclusions expressed by Consensys' own attorneys in a letter sent to the regulator asking about ETH's status as a security given the SEC's approval of certain spot ether exchange-traded fund application filings.  Consensys sued the SEC in April, alleging that the regulator was investigating whether Ethereum, post-merge, might be a security.  Ether rose as much as 2.6% after a Consensys post on X, data from TradingView show. It is up around 3% over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko.

That may indicate a challenging period ahead for the U.S. economy and speculative activities.  Top meme coins have dropped 20% in four weeks.  The U.S. consumer is increasingly struggling to keep up with credit-card loan payments, painting a challenging picture for the economy and speculative activity in non-serious assets like meme coins.  The percentage of credit card loans in serious delinquency, with balances outstanding for more than 90 days, increased to 10.69% in the first quarter, the highest since second-quarter 2012, data recently published by the New York Federal Reserve showed. While balances declined by $14 billion to $1.12 trillion during the first quarter, they're still 13.1% higher than the year before.  Cracks in consumer finances are one of the most concerning economic data points, Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, said earlier this year, adding that it's often a leading indicator that ""things are about to get worse.""  A mounting debt pile means less disposable income and weakened inclination to invest in risk assets such as meme coins. According to an article written by Luigi Guiso, Tullio Jappelli and Daniele Terlizzese in the American Economic Review, borrowing constraints can lead to individuals keeping a lower proportion of their wealth in illiquid and risky assets.  Interestingly, meme coins, which are considered among the riskiest of digital assets, have been under pressure in the past four weeks, falling more than market leader bitcoin {{BTC}}. Top meme coins by market value like DOGE, SHIB and WIF have dropped over 20% against bitcoin's 2.4%, Coingecko data shows.  While consumer finances are weakening, it does not necessarily mean a complete collapse in meme coins, as ""degens"" might persist. Degens, or people engaging in high-risk speculative trading in the crypto market, are not fundamentally different from early internet adopters, AllianceDAO's Qiao Wang said in a blog post, characterizing them as: ""Financial risk-takers who are brave enough to try unproven products.""  They do not pay attention to metrics, tokenomics, fundamental analysis or technical analysis, as noted by Ledger Academy and are ""committed to the projects and communities they invest in.""  Kelly Greer, head of Americas sales at Galaxy, said degens are likely to stay active in the market despite mounting debt levels.  ""60% of Americans hold credit card debt and this continues to rise. By no coincidence, gambling and degeneracy also proliferate, @zerohedge may be right that the economy is cooked - but disagree on memes dying with it degens will gamble longer than the economy will stay solvent,"" Greer said on X.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOGE,BTC | DOGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/19/meme-coins-and-macro-us-credit-card-holders-most-stressed-since-2012,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ddcfc19db04a00ae6fd6ab146cf917b6ff753b77-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Prices have plummeted a staggering 40-90% in recent months, mirroring past crashes but with a glacial pace that’s leaving investors numb. Renowned crypto analyst Daan Crypto sees this as a necessary correction, albeit a slow and potentially painful one. Related Reading: Metrics Signal Bitcoin Price Increase – But When Is Anyone’s Guess Echoes Of Crashes Past, But With A Muted Roar Seasoned crypto veterans might be experiencing a sense of deja vu. The scene: altcoin prices in freefall, portfolios hemorrhaging value. The twist? This bear market, while no less brutal in its outcome, lacks the ferocious speed of its predecessors. Unlike the gut-wrenching plunges witnessed during the 2020 pandemic crash, the current decline is a slow burn, dragging on for months. While the current situation might seem bleak, there’s a crucial distinction from past crashes, explains Daan Crypto. The drops are significant, but they’re happening at a slower pace. This could indicate a more drawn-out correction phase for the market. At this point alts have come down about 40-90%. Although it wasn’t as violent as during the covid crash, the end result has been roughly the same for many coins. We’re just doing everything slower this time around. Thing is, back then alts had barely moved up until that point.… pic.twitter.com/xSxzme3IlH — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) June 18, 2024 This measured descent presents a double-edged sword for investors. While it offers a (somewhat) less terrifying experience, it also extends the period of financial pain. The silver lining, according to Daan Crypto, lies in the muted highs altcoins reached before the crash. Unlike previous cycles where altcoins skyrocketed before plummeting, their pre-crash performance this time around was more tempered. The relatively lower highs suggest the market might not be as overheated as in the past. This could mean a potentially faster recovery once the correction runs its course. Deja Vu Or Deja Boom? Analyst Sees Echoes Of 2020 Looking beyond the immediate altcoin downturn, Daan Crypto draws parallels between the current market and the events of 2020. The analyst points to the strong performance of the market in 2023, particularly impressive for a year following a bear market. This mirrors the robust performance of late 2019, which preceded the 2020 crash. If we compare 2023 to 2019 and 2024 to 2020, there are some interesting similarities, the analyst observes. Just like 2020, which witnessed a mid-year slump followed by a strong year-end recovery, 2024 might be following a similar trajectory. Related Reading: Analyst’s Bullish Call: Bitcoin Primed For Massive Jump To $127,000 This historical comparison offers a glimmer of hope for investors weary of the current downturn.

42408025,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8qzB,1718784052,"Martin Shkreli Says He Is Behind Trump-Linked DJT as ZachXBT, GCR Start Poking Around","Martin Shkreli, also known as ""Pharma Bro,"" claims he and Barron Trump created the DJT token after initially denying involvement.  This revelation followed a series of events, including Shkreli's $100 million bet with crypto trader GCR on the token's authenticity and blockchain sleuth ZachXBT's uncovering evidence linking Shkreli to the token.  Despite the drama, the Trump campaign has not officially commented on the matter as of Wednesday.  Martin “Pharma Bro” Shkreli said on Tuesday that he was behind the controversial DJT token in an X space tuned in by thousands of people, days after denying any involvement as influential accounts GiganticRebirth and ZachXBT joined in on the search for its creator.  “I have 1000 pieces of evidence I created it with Barron,” Shkreli wrote to blockchain sleuth ZachXBT in a direct message posted by the latter. He confirmed the same in his X spaces podcast shortly after.  The flavor-of-the-week token caused certain crypto enthusiasts to extensively wonder who was behind it after it went viral on Monday for its supposed links to Donald Trump and his son Barron.  Blockchain sleuths found that DJT’s Telegram channel appeared to share the same admins as a token supported by Shkreli. Shkreli denied any involvement at the time, while DJT continued to rally.  But things took a turn Tuesday night.  Anonymous and influential crypto trader GiganticRebirth, popularly known as GCR, called out Trump’s supposed involvement in the token in his first X post reply since November 2022.  He put up $100 million (not a typo) in a bet against Trump having to do anything with the project.  That bet was originally floated by Alex Wice, another influential and popular crypto trader, at a value of $1 million. Shkreli appeared to provoke industry “whales,” a colloquial term for a person with significant token holdings, in a post citing Wice’s – which drew GCR, a known Trump backer, out of the woodworks.  “The only way this is 'real,' is if Donald J Trump himself, says he launched a meme coin himself,” GCR posted. “I'm well aware there is a cabal strategy to bribe people in the Trump orbit to pretend they had something to do with this when in reality a cabal of crypto whales did a presale and allocation to KOLs.”  In a separate post, GCR claimed to have been approached about being involved in the DJT project which he declined. Shkreli denied GCR was ever approached to be a part.  Meanwhile, in the hours following GCR’s post, on-chain intelligence firm Arkham posted a $150,000 bounty that would pay out the amount to whoever unveiled the creator of the DJT token.  This drew out ZachXBT, one of the most widely followed crypto sleuth on X, to submit his findings to Arkham. Shkreli’s messages to Zach and his X spaces came subsequently afterward.  Shkreli’s now wants GCR to honor his side of the $100 million bet, having claimed that he co-created the token with Barron Trump’s supposed involvement.  As such, the Trump campaign has not responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment on the topic since Monday, and as of Wednesday, Trump has posted nothing on his TruthSocial platform mentioning a token.  Meanwhile, at least one large holder in both DJT and Shoggoth.ai, Shkreli’s other project, has been profiting amid the drama.  Transactional data flagged by ZachXBT shows one large DJT holder sold nearly $830,000 worth of DJT late Tuesday. The wallet holds millions of dollars worth of SHOGGOTH tokens.

The uptake of CBDC's may only have marginal benefits in the Middle East and Central Asia if other barriers are not addressed, the IMF findings said.  Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) may not be essential to achieve intended policy goals, according to a survey of 19 central banks in the Middle East and Central Asia (ME&CA) region by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  The survey also said that CBDCs can advance financial inclusion and lower the cost of financial services, and yet adopting a CBDC, requires careful consideration. However, the survey noted that underlying constraints and improving other digital payment systems may be a more practical alternative to CBDCs.  The IMF has been researching the evolution of CBDCs and guiding member nations about how and whether to integrate them into their respective monetary systems. A senior IMF official has also said that ""one global CBDC platform that will allow for capital controls could cut payment costs."" Several nations in the ME&CA region have explored the use of CBDCs, including Saudi Arabia, whose central bank recently joined a cross-border experiment with CBDCs for international trade with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The IMF's Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has also previously said that CBDCs could replace cash in island economies.  ""Ultimately, introducing digital currencies will be a long and complicated process that central banks must approach with care,"" the IMF survey concluded. ""Policymakers need to determine if a CBDC serves their country’s objectives and whether the expected benefits outweigh the potential costs, risks for the financial system, and operational risks for the central bank.""  Additionally, the IMF warned that since about 83% of funding for the banks in the region come from deposits, CBDC's may compete with bank deposits, which could weigh on bank profits and lending, and thus impact financial stability of a nation.  The survey said that the 19 central banks in the region are exploring issuing a CBDC the countries are mainly focused on how CBDCs can enhance financial inclusion and payment system efficiency.  ""Specifically, in Middle East and North Africa oil exporters and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, where financial markets are relatively more developed, the priority is making both domestic and cross-border payments more efficient, while for Middle East and North Africa oil importers, the Caucasus and Central Asia, and low-income countries, it is expanding financial inclusion.""  The findings said that the uptake of CBDC's may only have marginal benefits without remedying other barriers like low digital and financial literacy, lack of identification, distrust of financial institutions, and low wealth.

29672638,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625357,1718778600,This Is The Biggest Issue With Altcoins This Cycle: Crypto Analyst,"In a thread on X, Miles Deutscher, a renowned figure in the crypto analysis sector, has dissected what he views as a critical flaw in the current altcoin market. Addressing his extensive following, Deutscher elaborated on the impact of the rapid increase in the number of new crypto tokens, an issue he believes to be at the core of the altcoins’ underperformance in this cycle. The Proliferation Of Crypto Since April 2024, the crypto landscape has witnessed the introduction of over 1 million new crypto tokens, with a notable half of these being memecoins created primarily on the Solana network. According to Deutscher, the ease of deploying these tokens on-chain contributes to an inflated token count but highlights a deeper issue of market saturation and dilution. Deutscher elaborates, “We now have 5.7 times the amount of crypto tokens than we did during peak bull in 2021. This is a major reason why crypto has been struggling this year, despite Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs.” He likens the excessive issuance of new tokens to inflation, where “the more tokens that launch, the more cumulative supply pressure on the market.” Related Reading: Expert Forecasts Altcoin Market Crash, Suggests Optimal Buy-In Points For Top 10 Cryptos The analyst also sheds light on the dynamics of venture capital (VC) investments in the crypto space, noting the largest quarter for VC funding peaked at $12 billion in Q1 2022, just as the market began to turn bearish. Deutscher criticizes the timing and strategy of VCs, suggesting that while their capital injection is essential for project development, it often leads to market imbalances. “VCs, like retail investors, are opportunists. Their investment timing often aims to maximize returns rather than support sustainable project growth, contributing to cyclical peaks and troughs in the market,” Deutscher explains. He continues to discuss the subsequent market effects, where projects delay launches in unfavorable conditions, only to flood the market when sentiment turns, worsening the dilution. The constant introduction of new tokens not only strains the market’s liquidity but also affects investor confidence, especially among retail investors. Deutscher emphasizes, “The skew towards private markets is one of the biggest and most damaging issues in crypto, especially compared to other markets like equities and real estate.” Related Reading: Flocka Fiasco: Waka Flocka Flame’s Crypto Launch Crashes Into Insider Trading Scandal This environment creates a barrier to entry for new liquidity and leaves retail investors feeling sidelined, a sentiment exacerbated by high-profile failures like LUNA and FTX. Deutscher argues, “If retail investors feel like they can’t win, they won’t play the game, which is why memes have dominated this year—it’s the only meta where retail feels like they have a fighting chance.” Looking forward, Deutscher proposes several strategies to mitigate these issues. Exchanges could enforce better token distribution standards and prioritize larger community allocations. Additionally, adjusting the percentage of tokens unlocked at launch could help manage sell pressure more effectively. “Even if the insiders don’t enforce change, the market eventually will,” Deutscher asserts. He suggests that exchanges should adopt rigorous standards for listing new projects and be equally stringent about delisting those that fail to meet ongoing criteria, thus preserving market integrity and liquidity. In his closing remarks, Miles Deutscher hopes his insights will foster better understanding and prompt a reevaluation of current practices. “Dispersion isn’t the only problem, but it certainly is a major one—and something that needs to be discussed more openly to foster a healthier crypto ecosystem.” At press time, Ethereum (ETH) traded at $3,562.

Fueled by worries about the global economy and reduced summer liquidity, Bitcoin dropped below the $65,000 mark for the first time since May 16. Notably, Ethereum (ETH) also faced a 4% loss, trading at $3,400, while other cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, Solana (SOL), and dogecoin (DOGE), suffered even bigger declines. Market Uncertainty Persists Marko Jurina, CEO of Jumper.Exchange, a decentralized exchange (DEX), highlighted that during economic and market uncertainty, traders often sell at a discount to minimize losses or exit riskier positions until the situation becomes clearer. Related Reading: XRP Set For Monumental Rally: Analyst Points To Extremely Rare Signal Jurina explained that the current scenario appears to be a combination of these factors, as weakening global economic conditions, unresolved geopolitical issues, and thinner market activity during the summer months contribute to heightened market volatility. These conditions will persist for the next few months, potentially leading to parabolic movements in either direction for the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin has grappled with the $70,000 threshold since its record high of $73,700 on March 14. Although it briefly tested this level in early June, it has since been unable to regain its bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency is currently down 4% for the month and 9% for the quarter. Bitcoin Correction Toward $61,000? CryptoQuant’s on-chain data suggests that traders had reduced their holdings since late May when Bitcoin touched the $70,000 level. This selling trend continues without significant buying activity. Ki Young Ju, Founder of CryptoQuant, highlighted that Bitcoin long-term holder whales have sold $1.2 billion in the past two weeks, likely through brokers. Additionally, there have been negative net flows in ETFs, with $460 million outflows during the same period. Young Ju contended that if this substantial sell-side liquidity is not purchased over-the-counter (OTC), brokers may deposit Bitcoin to exchanges, potentially impacting the market. On June 14, crypto analyst Ali Martinez stressed that Bitcoin needed to break above the $66,250 level quickly to avoid a potential correction to $61,100. As the cryptocurrency struggles to regain bullish momentum, Martinez hinted at a possible drop to $61,000. Another analyst, Rekt Capital, pointed out that Bitcoin is nearing the filling of its first Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap, with gaps at $64,000 and $62,500.

42390783,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdJqzT,1718775000,Patrick McHenry Explains FIT21's Passage,"Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) chairs the powerful House Financial Services Committee, and has been the leading Republican on the panel for years. Last year, he spent a few weeks as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House of Representatives, after lawmakers voted to oust then-speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). McHenry announced his retirement in December and will leave office when his term expires this coming January. He spoke virtually at Consensus 2024 in Austin at the end of May.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  'Two-thirds … is extraordinary'  The narrative  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) spoke at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 last month, discussing everything from the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) to how he landed up as Speaker Pro Tempore. Similar to last week's newsletter, my questions have been shortened but the Congressman's statements have only been edited lightly.  Why it matters  The Congressman has been a key figure in crypto circles, working on and advocating for legislation and advancing a bill through the House last month.  Breaking it down  I want to get started right away. Obviously last week [near the end of May], we saw the House vote overwhelmingly in favor of the FIT21 bill. How did we get here?  Two-thirds of the House voting for the bill is extraordinary when its simple policy, and when its innovative and new policy, it's even harder. But we got here because of valid policy – number one – real innovation and relationships. Now let me explain. We listened to all the critiques of the existing marketplace in crypto. We listened to the critique of policymakers that wanted to improve the marketplace on both parties, both sides of the House, both sides of the chamber, and we built our policy set around the conditions that people saw for themselves in trying to answer those questions, that's number one, policy.  Then we have real innovation – real builders doing real things using real technology. The real technology is getting there, but it has to be evidenced to policymakers that there is real innovation, and we're now seeing it in a major way. Third, relationships, both with policymakers like me, with Congressman French Hill, Congressman Glenn Thompson, Congressman Dusty Johnson, as well as Democrats, like Wiley Nickel in my native state of North Carolina, as well as Jim Himes, Brittany Pettersen from Colorado and Josh Gottheimer, and a number of other Democrats that are deeply engaged on the policy set. So then outside relationships, you the innovators, the builders, the technologist decided that Washington was important. And you started developing relationships, real relationships with policymakers and explaining the real innovation and the policy to policymakers. That's what made the difference. And those relationships, but nice pressure on policymakers to perform. And we saw performance in a major way, which gives us a great opportunity to make a law this year.  Gotcha. So, you know, I think the big question now for many of us is where does this bill go from here?  Well, that's where the next set of operations move to. Look, the White House not issuing a veto threat on FIT21 was helpful and good, and it shows that they want to be at the table and make policy here. The Senate is a more complicated beast, it always is, but we need to do all that we can to reach out to senators and make sure that they prioritize this in this election year, and getting things through the Senate, and if we can get two-thirds of the House to vote for this bill, they should be able to get two-thirds of the Senate to vote for this bill or something very similar.  Is it that this is an election year that we're seeing so many lawmakers from both parties vote for crypto bills like the SAB 121 repeal and the FIT21 Act? Or is there any validity to the idea that this is the first time these bills have even come up for a vote in the House and Senate?  It's new policy. We have heard from the outside world and in the news media that there are crypto voters. And I think it's clear there are crypto voters, and they can go to the left or they can go to the right for the candidates. But they primarily want to know whether or not you're innovation-forward and you're for crypto, and I think that's helped soften up policymaking.  The other thing that's of interest is that the fight from some in Washington is about the last financial crisis. And they've tried to make everything that deals with financial policy into bank policy. And especially too big to fail policy, or post-financial crisis policy. Crypto is not. Crypto is not traditional finance. I don't think it's still constrained by the old politics of the last financial crisis. This is a whole new thing. It's innovation policy, and it's the next foundation of of technology, the internet, and we want to be at the forefront of this, not behind the rest of the world. So I think that factor is big as well, that this is not financial, these aren't financial products, per se, it's technology we need to have a regulated means of using this technology, building this technology in the United States, and not falling behind Europe and the rest of the EU..  We spoke a year ago about the possibilities of a crypto bill getting through Congress … I was hoping maybe you could just speak a little bit to what the challenges that you specifically encountered were and basically what happened?  Well, we talked last in this format, I didn't think that I was going to end up being Speaker Pro Tem, that we'd have a Speaker of the House thrown out for only having legislative successes. I didn't think my party would be that stupid to do that. But that happened, and I ended up serving as Speaker Pro Tem for 23 days last October. That scrambled the legislative playbook. And I designed my agenda in committee around what I thought the legislative framework would be what the legislative opportunity would be.  A lot happened that was unforeseen, when we last talked that put us behind, and actually put us behind in this policy – bringing crypto to the fore, bringing FIT21 to the floor by probably five, six months. But in those five or six months, relationships built, innovation occurred and policy sharpened and all that helped to build a bigger vote for FIT21 in the House. So some of those delays were political and the calendar, the legislative calendar but the advantage we got out of that is a bigger vote in the House, which will give us an opportunity and we live to fight another day and get something out of the Senate. If we get something out of the Senate, I think we'll get something signed by this President. And if not this President, the next President.  For a while, it seemed like stablecoin legislation might be the most likely candidate for becoming a law in the near future, and I'm just curious to know what your expectations are now, what work is going on?  Well, look at this stage, right now, we will have crypto law within the next year. And I can say that with certainty. If it doesn't happen now, between now and the election, I think that what we've passed out of the House will make its way into law, and in very similar form, under the next Congress, I really think that happened.  Same thing for stablecoin legislation. I think we're so close on this, we just need a legislative calendar, so that we can get things across the finish line in the Senate. And that means we have to have the time allocated to do it. So I think at this stage of the game, crypto policy is inevitable, and crypto law is inevitable. And we will start catching up with Europe, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan and having some market certainty and pro-innovation policy.  So earlier today, we had Majority Whip Tom Emmer onstage on the stage, and he suggested that the lame duck session might be a time or the opportunity for attaching something to a must-pass bill – are you looking at any of the pieces of legislation that are likely to move in that time period as maybe did vehicle to have some crypto legislation, make its way?  Anything, and everything, that's what I'm looking for. We basically have a consensus product out of the House of Representatives, that gives us a fighting chance in every legislative product that makes its way to the President's desk, I think that's a huge thing that we've got to take advantage of, and leverage it into law, and use every opportunity that we have to get a good deal.  Are there any other issues in crypto specifically that you're looking at as areas where, you know, maybe it could benefit from legislation either addressing the regulators, different markets? And, you know, so how are you looking at these?  Well, look, I'm not going to go negotiate against myself. We've got a bill out of the House of Representatives, and it got almost every Republican, and it got a third of the Democrats. In this political environment, for us to do that is massive, massive, and almost unheard of when it comes to policy coming out of the [Agriculture] Committee, or out of the Financial Services Committee in the House. So I think that's a big thing, and it's the main thing, and we're gonna stay focused on the main thing. If we get market structure done, that is a win. And then we can further refine what these regulators should and should not be doing. But if we get this market structure bill passed, that will put us at the forefront of digital asset policy for the globe. That's where we deserve to be, that's where we should be. That's where I'm fighting for us to be.  You announced your retirement at the end of this term. You have seven months. I'm really curious, are there any particular goals, any piece of legislation besides crypto or in addition to what you've already gotten through the House that you're just looking to accomplish in that time?  I've got my three major priorities for the Financial Services Committee, and that is the market structure bill, for digital assets, number one. Number two, data privacy for the financial services realm. We've got to make sure that we have the best technology protecting our financial data. And third and finally, capital formation, helping link up investors with new investment opportunities for small businesses to find new sources of capital, and to make the system easier for folks to get their ideas connected with capital. And so those are my major priorities, the capital formation, data privacy and digital assets. And I'll take any one of those signed into law this year.  I know you have to jump, but I really appreciate your joining us. And good luck with the rest of your term.  Well, thank you, Nik. And thank you all for your engagement without, without the crypto community without the digital asset, world, and activist. Without every tweet, without every phone call you've made without every email, we would not have had this big vote in the House.  So keep innovating, keep driving, Keep creating. And that will help bring us victory and clarity under law. So thanks so much for your engagement. And thank you for your friendship. God bless.

ADA is now rising and might attempt to clear the $0.400 resistance zone. ADA price remained in a bearish zone and settled below $0.40. The price is trading below $0.400 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.3760 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above $0.400. Cardano Price Remains In Negative Zone In the past few days, Cardano started a downward move like Bitcoin and Ethereum after it failed to clear the $0.450 resistance. ADA dipped below the $0.400 support and tested the $0.360 zone. A low was formed at $0.360 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a minor recovery wave above the $0.3750 zone. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4204 swing high to the $0.3600 low. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.3760 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. However, the price faces many hurdles on the upside. ADA is still trading below $0.400 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.3980 zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4204 swing high to the $0.3600 low. The first resistance is near $0.400. The next key resistance might be $0.410. If there is a close above the $0.410 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.4250 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.450. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.400 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.3850 level. The next major support is near the $0.380 level and the trend line. A downside break below the $0.380 level could open the doors for a test of $0.3650. The next major support is near the $0.360 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.

XRP Price Holds Support XRP price failed to start a fresh increase and again reacted to the downside like Bitcoin. There was a move below the $0.4800 level, but the bulls were active near the $0.4765 level. A low was formed at $0.4765 and the price is now correcting losses.

Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.4980 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.490 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

29667951,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625245,1718769634,"Hard To Be “Too Scared Of Bitcoin Price Action,” Says Analyst. Here’s Why","Bitcoin has been having a bad time recently, but this analyst isn’t too worried about it, based on the recent trend in an on-chain indicator. Bitcoin Unrealized Loss Has Been At Low Levels Recently In a new post on X, on-chain analyst Checkmate talked about how the latest price action of the cryptocurrency isn’t too scary when considering the trend in the Unrealized Loss. The “Unrealized Loss” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total loss that addresses across the Bitcoin network are holding right now. This metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. Assuming that this latest transaction was the last point at which the coin changed hands, the price at its time would reflect its current cost basis. Related Reading: XRP, Dogecoin, & Shiba Inu All See Negative Sentiment: Signal To Buy? If this cost basis is higher than the current spot price of the cryptocurrency for any coin, then that particular coin can be considered to hold a net unrealized loss currently. The Unrealized Loss subtracts the two values to calculate the magnitude of loss for every coin and then sums them up. Naturally, coins of the opposite type contribute towards the “Unrealized Profit” metric instead. In the context of the current discussion, the Unrealized Loss itself isn’t of interest, but rather a normalized form called the Relative Unrealized Loss. This metric divides the Unrealized Loss by the asset’s market cap. Below is a chart showing this Bitcoin indicator’s trend over the past decade or so. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin Relative Unrealized Loss peaked during the November 2022 bear market lows and has since been heading down. Recently, the metric’s value has been close to zero, implying the losses in the market have only been equal to a negligible percentage of the market cap. The reason behind these lows is the recent price surge towards the new all-time high (ATH). The entire supply becomes profitable during ATH breaks, so the Unrealized Loss shrinks to zero. The indicator naturally also fell to zero earlier in the year when the ATH took place, but the bearish price action since then has meant that some of the investors have gone back into losses. Interestingly, though, the indicator’s value has still been extremely low, implying that while some buying has occurred at the higher prices, it hasn’t been excessive. From the chart, it’s visible that spikes followed bull market tops in the past in the indicator, as only a small drop was enough to put all the latecomers chasing hype into a loss. That hasn’t been the case in the current cycle so far. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Crash To $60,000 If This Support Gets Lost: CryptoQuant Head “It is hard for me to be too scared of Bitcoin price action when unrealized losses look like this,” notes Checkmate. The analyst also cautions that it could deteriorate from here, but it hasn’t happened yet.

29666056,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625278,1718766032,"Dogecoin’s Ownership Shifts: Whales Downsize As Prices Dip, Who’s In Charge Now?","As the crypto market endures another tumultuous period, Dogecoin has seen significant changes in its ownership structure. Recent data from IntoTheBlock reveals a notable shift, with major Dogecoin whales—those holding more than 0.1% of the total supply—reducing their stakes. Dogecoin Redistribution: Who Is In Charge Now? IntoTheBlock data indicates that this position reduction from these whales has been ongoing for the past year. Specifically, the share of Dogecoin controlled by these large holders has decreased from 45.3% to 41.3%. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Monumental Surge In Transactions As Whales Spend $129 Million This trend suggests a possible decentralization of ownership or a strategic shift in the holdings of larger investors, perhaps in response to market conditions or broader cryptocurrency trends. Simultaneously, this decrease among major holders has been accompanied by increased ownership among retail and mid-sized investors. These smaller investors have seized the opportunity to accumulate more Dogecoin, raising their collective stake in the total supply. This redistribution of Dogecoin holdings could indicate a growing democratization in the investment landscape of this particular cryptocurrency. As more individuals and smaller investors become significant stakeholders, the dynamics of market reactions to news and events could shift, potentially leading to increased market stability or different volatility patterns based on these new majority holders’ trading behaviors. Price Dips: Traders Suffer, Analysts Remain Optimistic Meanwhile, the decentralization of Dogecoin holdings contrasts with the current market conditions, where the price of Dogecoin has fallen nearly 10% in the last 24 hours to $0.211. This decline is part of a broader downturn that saw the cryptocurrency shed 12.5% of its value over the past week, bringing its market capitalization below $18 billion. This downward trend in Dogecoin’s price is impacting traders significantly. According to Coinglass, the last 24 hours have seen 165,199 traders liquidated, contributing to $459.04 million in total market liquidations. Dogecoin traders alone have faced about $61.89 million in losses. Liquidation in the crypto market refers to the forced closure of leveraged positions due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when they cannot meet the margin requirements for their leveraged position. Despite the prevailing bearish trends, the sentiment isn’t universally negative. Santiment reports a decrease in crowd sentiment towards Dogecoin, suggesting that the current low prices might offer a buying opportunity for patient investors. This perspective aligns with observations from market analysts who see the potential for recovery. Particularly, Trader Tardigrade, a renowned crypt analyst on X, describes a “Ladle Pattern” in Dogecoin’s price movements, indicating a potential bullish trend. $DOGE has been forming Ladle Pattern in each cycle.

Ride on it 🚀#Dogecoin pic.twitter.com/zJQBnWuoSv — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) June 15, 2024 Meanwhile, Crypto analyst Javon Marks predicts a significant upswing for Dogecoin, anticipating a price surge based on historical performance and projecting an optimistic future for the meme coin amidst its current lows.

This year, presidential candidates have embraced cryptocurrencies to obtain the industry’s support. As a result, the community has capitalized on the momentum with Memecoins. Related Reading: Flocka Fiasco: Waka Flocka Flame’s Crypto Launch Crashes Into Insider Trading Scandal PolitiFi tokens, a new memecoin category inspired by political figures, have performed remarkably this Q2. Trump-inspired tokens have been the talk of the town after the Republican candidate started endorsing cryptocurrencies. However, these memecoins have suffered a massive 30% drop in the last 24 hours. An Official DJT Token? On Monday, Pirate Wires’ X account announced the launch of an alleged official ‘Trump Coin.’ According to the report, the token is supposedly led by Trump’s 18-year-old son, Barron Trump. “Per conversations, Trump is Launching an official token – $DJT on Solana, Barron spearheading,” read the post. Mike Solana, CMO at Founders Fund and editor-in-chief at Pirates Wires, shared a smart contract address seemingly linked to the token. Additionally, he stated he was “just reporting” on what he knew “via sources” and that he “didn’t speak with Trump directly.” Similarly, Martin Shkreli claimed the DJT token is real on an X Space. He later maintained his position, highlighting the “confirmation” from a friend of Barron Trump. In a post, the 17-year-old stated, “$DJT IS THE ONLY REAL TRUMP TOKEN.” However, the crypto community remains skeptical about the authenticity of the memecoin. Several users highlighted various red flags surrounding the “official” token, including the DJT’s X Account. A user pointed out that the official X account has a “strange” following list. This list includes the controversial figure Andrew Tate, American streamer Adin Ross, and Shkreli. Moreover, crypto analytics firm Bubblemaps revealed that 67% of the token’s supply was in one cluster. Raydium Concentrated Liquidity is the largest holding, accounting for 43% of the supply. Many community members expressed their concerns with humor. Some users suggested that serial scammer Sahil Arora, responsible for several celebrity memecoins rugs, orchestrated the token launch. Others wondered if the inconsistencies of the launch made it “more or less likely” that it was a business venture from the Trump family. At the time of writing, no official sources have confirmed Trump’s involvement with the DJT token. Trump Memecoins Plummet Over a month ago, the former US president declared he was “fine” with cryptocurrencies and wanted to make it a “solid” industry with clear regulations. At the time, Trump-inspired memecoins soared over 63% following his declarations. Additionally, the PolitiFi sector surged, with tokens like BODEN increasing by nearly 30%. Nonetheless, the story is different this time as the rumors of an official Trump token negatively impacted the performance of the memecoins. The PolitFi tokens report a 30% decline in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $1.03 billion. Trump-related tokens took the biggest hit in the sector. Many dropped between 20% and 30% on the last day. MAGA (TRUMP), the largest token related to the former US president, saw its price decline by nearly 50% in four hours.

Ethereum And Bitcoin ETF Merge? Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart noted that Hashdex’s proposed ETF would be market cap-weighted and could potentially accommodate additional digital assets as they gain approval from the SEC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Braces For 10-20% Crash, Top Analyst Cites 90% Chance Of Pullback Hashdex already operates a successful crypto index ETF in Brazil, known as HASH11, which primarily consists of Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it a logical step to introduce a similar offering to the US market, according to Seyffart. Notably, the filing with the SEC states that Hashdex plans to use the services of at least two custodians, Coinbase and BitGo, to ensure the safe storage of the underlying assets. While spot Ethereum ETFs in the US are yet to receive full approval from the SEC, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has suggested an estimated launch date of July 2nd based on minor feedback received by issuers. This development indicates that the SEC’s review process for spot Ethereum ETFs is nearing completion, setting the stage for potential market expansion and increased investment opportunities. Hashdex’s decision to launch a joint Ethereum and Bitcoin ETF aligns with their belief that as cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance, new assets will emerge to disrupt the market share of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Crypto Indices In a recent blog post analyzing the current state of the market, the asset manager explained that by offering a diverse basket of crypto assets through an index-based approach, Hashdex aims to provide investors with exposure to the growth potential of these alternative digital assets. The asset manager’s success in Brazil, where crypto index ETFs have surpassed single-asset products, underscores the benefits of diversification and regulated ETF structures. Hashdex anticipates this trend to expand to Europe and eventually the US, as “evolving regulations” and growing demand from professional investors and wealth managers favor diversified exposure.

Ultimately, Hashdex’s filing for a joint Ethereum and Bitcoin ETF signifies a pivotal moment in expanding the accessibility of crypto investments. With the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs and the increasing adoption of diversified crypto index strategies, the stage is set for a brighter future for investors seeking exposure to the digital asset space.

This time around, a crypto analyst has predicted a notable surge in the SHIB price, with the expectation that it will reach a new all-time high by the time the rally is complete. Shiba Inu Poised For New All-Time Highs In an analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Javon Marks has shared a rather bullish expectation for the Shiba Inu price. Marks, who has been quite vocal about his support for the coin, continued into the new week, predicting a new all-time high for the meme coin. The crypto analyst reveals that the Shiba Inu price had been trading inside of a small Bull Flag pattern. However, the meme coin has been able to break out of this bull flag pattern and could see a rally as a result of this development. As the crypto analyst explains, “this breakout may be enough to spark another major wave up in an already massive uphill run!” The major reason why this breakout is important is where the price could end up as a result. For one, the crypto analyst sees the price reaching its current all-time high above $0.000081 for a start. Then, if the rally were to continue from here, Marks expects SHIB to rise as high as $0.00015. The initial target would constitute an over 300% increase in price. However, the “larger breakout” which the analyst expects is on the horizon, is more important, bringing an over 800% increase in price if it comes to pass. “A break above $0.000081 and SHIB may just be set for another +90% move to $0.0001553,” Marks said. Being Bullish On SHIB The latest Shiba Inu analysis from crypto analyst Javon Marks is only the latest in a long line of bullish predictions that he has made for Shiba Inu. Marks’ thread goes as far back as September 2023, and since that time, the SHIB price has risen more than 200%. Despite the notable price increases since the first analysis was posted, the crypto analyst believes that the meme coin is far from done. The previous analyses also reiterates this point, expecting a continuation of the rally until its breaks out to $0.000081. Presently, the Shiba Inu price is still struggling against bearish crypto market headwinds after the Bitcoin price crashed to $66,000. It is down 9.42% in the last day alone, and struggling against 18.16% losses on the weekly chart as well.
