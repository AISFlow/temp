42433339,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOOXPh,1608069634,Ripple Board Lands JPMorgan Veteran and Regulatory Expert Sandie O'Connor,"Sandie O’Connor, the former chief regulatory affairs officer for JPMorgan Chase, is joining Ripple’s board of directors, the company announced Tuesday.      O’Connor will provide counsel on “government relations and regulatory initiatives” for the company’s next phase as Ripple expands and seeks regulatory clarity in the United States, it said.      The announcement comes as San Francisco-based Ripple is openly contemplating relocating its headquarters to another country, citing a lack of such clarity, particularly on the legal status of XRP, the cryptocurrency it owns large amounts of and has a mighty hand in developing.      Whatever decision the firm ultimately makes, O’Connor brings considerable regulatory and risk-management chops. During her time at JPMorgan, she served on multiple firm-wide governance committees including the ones overseeing risk and capital. She joined JPMorgan in 1988, and during her over three-decade long career also “led engagement with G-20 regulators and policymakers” for the bank, Ripple said. She retired from the institution in April 2019, according to her LinkedIn profile.  O’Connor still sits on advisory committees of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of Financial Research, an independent bureau created within the Treasury Department to monitor systemic risks after the 2008 global financial crisis.      She appears to have filled the seat on Ripple’s board vacated by Ken Kurson, who was arrested on cyberstalking charges in October, according to a report by the New York Times. Reportedly a close ally of the Trump family, Kurson also founded a crypto and blockchain news website called Modern Consensus. Ripple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      Once a top lieutenant to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, O’Connor also appeared regularly on American Banker magazine’s annual ranking of the most powerful women in banking.      On Ripple’s board, she will serve alongside former New York regulator Ben Lawsky, architect of the state’s BitLicense regulations, former diplomat Anja Manuel, and financial services industry veterans Yoshitaka Kitao and Craig Phillips, among others.

Meanwhile, the ether options market on Deribit has dipped in December although a block trade strategy in the $600-$800 price range has developed.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $19,510 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $19,053-$19,555 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above its 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price continues to climb for the fourth consecutive day, going as high as $19,555 as of press time and breaking out of a $19,200-$19,400 range for the second time in the past 24 hours.      Read More: Bitcoin May Have Hit Wall of Profit Takers Around $19,500: Analyst      However, some resistance in the form of sell orders around the $20,000 price level may limit the amount of upside in December.      “It is an interesting picture: From one side it's clear ‘buy the dip’ mood, from the other side we have $20,000 as a big resistance,” said Misha Alefirenko, co-founder of VelvetFormula, a digital asset liquidity provider. “It feels very bullish on charts.”      According to CoinDesk 20 data, bitcoin has kept above the $19,000 price point since Dec. 13.      While bitcoin seems to be hitting bull mode after dipping below $17,800 this past Friday, Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, expects some selling to cap a fervent 2020 for the crypto markets.      “The run-up in BTC since March has been extraordinary, so investors and portfolio managers may be seeking to take profits and offload their BTC before end of year for tax purposes,” said Lau.      Read More: Mt. Gox Creditors’ Trustee Announces Draft Rehabilitation Plan      Lau noted concern the upcoming distribution of long-awaited bitcoin from defunct exchange Mt. Gox might introduce some sell-side dynamics at some point, but he nonetheless remains positive. “Mt. Gox's upcoming 140,000 BTC distribution is an overhang on the horizon,"" he said, ""but the fundamentals are still strong as ever.”      In the bitcoin futures market, open interest cracked $7.4 billion once again, the first time since Nov. 24 and a sign sophisticated investors are increasingly hedging positions by using crypto derivatives.      “After an almost uninterrupted bull run in just two months, the path of least resistance for bitcoin is on the downside, or at least bouncing in the $18,000-$20,000 range for a while,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer of quant firm ExoAlpha. Over the past nine weeks, bitcoin has appreciated over 70%, according to historical spot pricing on bellwether exchange Bitstamp.      Another analyst also sees the $20,000 mark as tough to surpass. “Bulls need a new catalyst to strongly overcome the $20,000 resistance level, else the selling pressure at that level will keep it down,” added ExoAlpha’s Lifchitz.      That catalyst may not arrive until next year, according to Michael Gord, chief executive officer of trading firm Global Digital Assets. “Once we start 2021, when the budgets for many institutional investors and enterprises reopen I expect to see a surge of new participation in bitcoin and of demand in companies having a strategy to implement digital assets,” Gord told CoinDesk.    Ether options action subsides in December    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH) was up Tuesday trading around $591 and climbing 0.80% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Of note for Tuesday is that a larger-than-normal block trade for ether options popped up, according to Greg Magadini, chief executive officer of Genesis Volatility.      “Although the overall dollar value of options traded is still lower than November, we saw a nice pickup in block volumes today,” Magadini told CoinDesk. He sees Genesis’ data indicating that an options strategy is developing where traders buy $600 calls while simultaneously selling $800 call options. A call option gives purchasers the right, but not obligation, to buy the underlying instrument (in this case, 1 ETH). “A big notable block trade we've seen today is a March $600-$800 call spread. If ETH is above $800 by March expiration, this position would be worth $350,000.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Tuesday.

42433342,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOOXdh,1608066001,Cboe Plans to Launch Cryptocurrency Indexes in Q2 2021,"Cboe Global Markets is joining the race to take cryptocurrency pricing mainstream.      The exchange owner will launch a suite of tools in 2021 in a licensing partnership with execution provider CoinRoutes. Cryptocurrency indexes, historical data and real-time ticks are all on the table, said Catherine Clay, Cboe’s information solutions chief.      The deal makes Cboe, which operates the largest options exchange in the U.S., the latest financial force to enter the cryptocurrency data business. It’s been a busy December, with service providers looking to keep up with institutions going long on bitcoin. For example, S&P unveiled its crypto index plans Dec. 3 and one week later announced a stake in Lukka, the firm facilitating the product.      Read more: S&P, State Street Back $15M Investment in Crypto Data Startup Lukka      Clay said Cboe will initially focus on providing data for “just a handful” of cryptocurrencies with high market caps – likely 10 or fewer top trading pairs to start. For example, bitcoin and ether traded against the dollar.      Rollout will come in three phases, she said. Cboe’s data shop will backfill historical price data in Q1 2021. It will then begin distributing real-time price data to clients. Once these two “foundational pieces” form, Clay said Cboe’s “index team can get busy.”      “I would guess that in Q2, you’ll start to see actual indices come from this data through our Cboe global index team,” Clay said.    Cboe taps CoinRoutes    Cboe picked CoinRoutes’ data after a yearlong evaluation of partners, Clay said. The thinking was that CoinRoutes’ order-routing business provides an edge in measuring the market. Plus, she was impressed by the firm’s methodologies accounting for discrepancies in fees across different exchanges.      CoinRoutes CTO Ian Weisberger told CoinDesk his firm’s order-book business gives it a “huge advantage” over data-only crypto firms, which might solely rely on where the market’s been, instead of where it’s going.      The deal continues a trend of crypto industry veterans courting wider audiences through alliances with mainstream names. While advanced crypto traders might already be familiar with CoinRoutes, Galaxy and Lukka for pricing data, newer crypto investors know brands like Cboe, S&P and Bloomberg far better.      “We’re attracted to [Cboe] because they’re a very large organization that has really good penetration in that space,” said CoinRoutes CEO David Weisberger.      Read more: Behind ‘Prime Broker’ Buzzword Lies a Complex Strategy Game for Crypto Firms      Clay said Cboe is rolling out this product as yet another data offering for clients demanding intelligence across asset classes of all stripes. Cboe is trying to “stay ahead” of traditional clients’ shift to digital assets.      “We want to be of service to them as they embark on that endeavor,” she said.      The partnership marks Cboe’s first jump into the realm of cryptocurrency data. It comes more than a year after Cboe abandoned another crossroads of digital assets and traditional finance: bitcoin futures trading. Cboe put its bitcoin futures product on ice in March 2019.      However, Clay said Cboe’s corporate interest in cryptocurrencies never diminished.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/15/cboe-plans-to-launch-cryptocurrency-indexes-in-q2-2021,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8965821dd65198075374791a579739cb4fee1291-1501x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Another co-founder, former President Jakov Dolic has rejoined the company as CEO and board chairman. The settlement includes the discontinuance of all legal proceedings and demands, the company said.      Founded in June 2019, the young company has fought controversy and legal battles for much of 2020. Dolic’s legal disputes originated when he sued Layer1 after claiming he invested millions of dollars and then was forced to leave the company, as CoinDesk previously reported.      Shortly after Dolic withdrew his lawsuit in November, Leigl filed a countersuit against Dolic and fellow shareholder Ivan Kirillov for malicious prosecution and shareholder misconduct.      Under Leigl, Layer1 also reportedly misdescribed the role of Liu Xiangfu, co-founder of Chinese bitcoin miner manufacturer Canaan and supposedly a core Layer1 team member, in an investor pitch deck.      Per the press release, Dolic and Liegl jointly stated, “Layer1 has a strong foundation for future growth, including mining operations with a capacity of 100MW, which the company will be expanding, and proprietary containerized solutions that will continue to drive Layer1’s operations.”      Leigl leaves the company just weeks after being named to Forbes 30 Under 30 list for 2021.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/15/ceo-of-bitcoin-mining-startup-layer1-resigns-in-settlement-replaced-by-ex-president,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e49fce2fc57cb1be655cbb7fd1d75af8496abe9-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42433351,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOOYRh,1608061338,Monero Breaks 2-Year High Amid Rising Concerns Over Online Ransom,"Prices for privacy-focused cryptocurrency monero broke its two-year high on Tuesday. It has been rallying since March’s crypto market sell-off.    The price of monero rose to as high as $157.64 early Tuesday, the highest level since June 2018, according to data compiled on the CoinDesk 20.  At the time of writing, monero traded at $152.09, nearly 300% up on a year-to-date basis.  Monero has been rallying for the most of 2020 despite regulatory concerns.  Launched in April 2014, monero was designed as a private, secure and untraceable cryptocurrency.  The protocol behind the cryptocurrency allows users to obfuscate their identities and hide the amounts transferred from third parties, except for those they designate.  Analysts said the increased demand for the privacy-focused token could be due to corporates’ growing worries about needing monero to pay ransom to hackers.  “While some corporates may have stepped up buying of bitcoin to increase their ability to achieve portfolio diversification ambitions, other corporates have equally stepped up efforts to procure digital assets such as monero, given its prevalent choice of payment by hackers,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime Brokerage Bequant told CoinDesk in an email response.  Although no monero-based ransom was demanded during the hack at the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments or the Google outage on Monday, these events have made more companies worry about similar hacks, according to Vinokourov.  The recent hacks ""show the ever-growing sophistication of bad actors,” he said.  Globally, crypto exchanges have been delisting many privacy coins, monero included, in order to remain compliant with know your customer/anti-money laundering (AML/KYC) requirements.  But Justin Ehrenhofer, compliance analyst at crypto market maker DV chain, told CoinDesk that monero traders may also have become more “optimistic” the continuing growths of monero will “reopen conversations at exchanges” on how they could list privacy-focused coins again.

(The Block)  Market intel    Sell pressure Bitcoin’s rally above $19,500 was clipped early on Tuesday, with significant sell pressure at $20,000 ahead, according to CoinDesk markets reporter Omkar Godbole. These sell walls are no joke. In fact, one analyst told Godbole this morning’s market dip could likely be attributed to profit taking by large Asia-based investors. CryptoQuant data shows whales taking a dip around $19,500, bringing the market with them. Big picture: Pondering Durian provides four reasons a modest bitcoin allocation might make sense.    At stake    There has been a lot of hyperventilating in the press and on Twitter this week over the fact that cryptocurrency is now, by default, the only form of payment Pornhub accepts.      Far less attention has been paid to the related news that the adult entertainment site is about to adopt its own version of know-your-customer rules, or KYC. Call it “Know Your Coomer” after the internet meme of a disheveled porn addict with poor impulse control and a hypertrophied right arm. (For those unfamiliar with online argot, it’s one of many derivatives of the epithet “boomer,” like “consoomer” for spendthrifts, “floomer” for those who insist COVID-19 is just the flu, or “coofer” for people exhibiting symptoms of the virus.)      And, much like the know-your-customer policies of financial institutions including regulated crypto exchanges, Know Your Coomer raises difficult questions about privacy and data protection.      Rewinding the tape: In response to a harrowing New York Times article about the posting of child exploitation imagery on Pornhub, Visa and Mastercard booted the site from their card networks. This left crypto, which Pornhub has accepted for several years, as the sole remaining payment option for the site’s premium users.      Yes, I checked.      No, I did not investigate further through this channel.      From the perspective of highlighting crypto’s value as a censorship-resistant form of money, this is all well and good. As disturbing as the revelations in the Times piece were, the use of financial infrastructure as an extrajudicial enforcement mechanism is creepy in its own way, just as it was in the Wikileaks banking blockade and Operation Choke Point.      The Open Source Defense newsletter said it well:      “The second-order danger ... is that you’re nearly certain to be able to find illegal content on any large platform for user-generated content. And no company at any level of technical expertise, from Google and Facebook on down, can fully prevent that. So when everybody’s guilty, getting shut down is only a matter of whether someone decides that it’s time to take a look at you. That’s not a world that’ll make anybody happy in the long run.”      An under-reported aspect of the story is the steps Pornhub is taking to prevent illegal content from being posted on this site.    Last week, the site, owned by Canada-based MindGeek, disabled uploadshttps://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002934613-Trust-and-Safety by any users who were not verified through its revenue-generating programs. “In the new year, we will implement a verification process so that any user can upload content upon successful completion of identification protocol,” Pornhub said. (Content previously uploaded by unverified users was subsequently nuked.)    If this prevents monsters from using the site in abusive ways, all the better. But it will create risks for those who only post lawful content. The following remains to be seen:    What information will be collected from users who want to upload content when the new protocol is implemented in 2021?  How will it be verified?  Will the information be stored with a third party or with MindGeek?  How long will the information be retained?  What steps will be taken to secure it?  Has MindGeek hired a vendor or vendors to handle ID collection, verification and/or storage?  Will the changes be limited to Pornhub or extended to other MindGeek adult sites as well.    I emailed these questions to MindGeek and its law firm last week but have not heard back (not surprising, given the company is managing a crisis situation).      Five years ago, the Ashley Madison breach showed how a poorly guarded trove of data on people who do legal but embarrassing things online can easily become a blackmailer’s goldmine. Pornhub would do well to heed this lesson.

42433348,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOOYBh,1608055286,Spring Labs Develops Data-Sharing Network for US Home Energy Projects,"Blockchain startup Spring Labs has put its first fraud-prevention tool into production using a permissioned version of Ethereum. The Los Angeles-based firm is now working with two lenders in the Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing space and onboarding two others, said co-founder John Sun.      Each lender now shares borrower and property data through the Spring Labs protocol, where it is either tokenized or sharded so that only the entity who contributed the data can view it. The lenders have been testing the platform since June and believe that it could save up to $10 million in fraud or 1% of the industry’s total loan transactions.      “They built a real-time database that I could ping to see if there are any other assessments on a property now or coming up,” Mike Schmidt, chief operating officer of PACE Funding, said in an interview. “None of us have done anything [with blockchain] before, but within a week it was paying dividends.”      PACE loans are used to finance construction projects that make buildings more energy-efficient or provide new sources of renewable energy for commercial, industrial and private residential properties. Run by the U.S. Department of Energy, the residential PACE program allows local and state governments in California, Florida and Missouri to provide funding for energy improvements.      Read more: California Agency Backs Green-Energy Pilot Using RSK’s Bitcoin Smart Contracts      Specifically, PACE loans create liens that are repaid by a homeowner’s property taxes. The consumers who seek PACE financing typically have lower-than-average FICO scores because they usually come to the program after getting denied an unsecured loan or home equity line of credit, Schmidt said.      “We are often their only hope of getting a new roof or an air conditioner,” Schmidt said. “We’re helping make solar mainstream and not just for the rich entitled people but for those in the working-class neighborhoods.”    Why blockchain    Spring Labs’ blockchain solution was an attractive one for PACE lenders who were concerned a centralized hub for data exchange might be another target for contractors who are trying to game the system, Schmidt said.      The space is dominated by four lenders because the most natural financiers have an incentive not to be PACE lenders: Mortgage lenders have the necessary skills to enter the PACE loans sector, but PACE loans have a “super lien” on the property, meaning they get paid out before mortgage payments.      For Spring Labs, this small number of participants made PACE an attractive space to test the Spring Protocol, said Sun. Because data is either tokenized or sharded, sharing financial data is no longer a competitive disadvantage. Spring Labs’ end goal is to replace credit rating bureaus and data aggregators by making data exchanges possible without centralized data hubs, which can be hacked and which also make data sharing more expensive.      Cutting out middlemen data exchangers is also the same logic Visa’s R&D arm had when quietly developing a blockchain that would allow banks to exchange customer data without data aggregators.      Read more: Visa R&D Arm Develops a Blockchain System That Could Replace Financial Data Aggregators      Lien-stacking isn’t the most legally fraught type of fraud the PACE program faces, but it is a problem that customers have been pushing lenders to solve, Schmidt said.      The most immediate pay-off for Schmidt’s business will be pitching other states on the idea of PACE lending. Currently, PACE Funding is a licensed lender under California’s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.      “Now we can go in and say, ‘California took one on the chin for you, and we’ve learned a lot of lessons the hard way, but we have a lot of consumer protection now so we never have to worry about stacked assessments in your state,’” Schmidt said.      In the future, Spring Labs is also aiming to give PACE lenders more data on bad contractors and more data on PACE borrowers to better determine creditworthiness, Sun said.      “This is an interesting use case for us to apply our technology,” Sun said. “We spun up a bespoke data-sharing network quickly in an industry that hasn’t shared a lot of information before. We think this is a safe technology that is better for lenders and consumers and is at much less risk for data losses.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/15/spring-labs-develops-data-sharing-network-for-us-home-energy-projects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/348eb5eddff2e992d8b71de78d4091d3dabdad81-1800x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433340,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOOXTh,1608054489,New Federal Reserve 'Qualitative' Approach Could Push Further Into Experimental Realm,"Never underestimate American ingenuity, especially when it comes to the Federal Reserve’s ability to invent monetary policy on the fly.      The U.S. central bank’s top officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, are expected this week to announce new “qualitative outcome-based” guidance to specify the conditions under which they might taper their stimulus-focused bond purchases, now proceeding at $120 billion a month. Such qualitative guidance would hinge on subjective criteria, such as a promise to keep buying bonds at the current pace until the pandemic is under control – which might be open to interpretation.      Since no changes are expected to the level of benchmark interest rates, already cut to near zero, the guidance might be the most significant outcome from the two-day, closed-door meeting that culminates Wednesday.      The new approach would join a growing list of unprecedented monetary strategies hatched by the Fed since the financial crisis of 2008, from former Chair Ben Bernanke’s “quantitative easing,” known as QE, to the “average inflation targeting” adopted in September. These are considered unconventional policies since they come into play once the Fed can’t cut interest rates any further without pushing into negative territory.      The upshot is that Fed officials might be using the new guidance as a way to tamp down expectations the bond purchases would continue ad infinitum, while leaving ample flexibility to continue the program as long as they see fit.      “The most important innovation for this meeting is likely to be an enhancement to their QE guidance by adopting qualitative outcome-based language,” Deutsche Bank Chief U.S. Economist Matthew Luzzetti told clients last week in a report.      The Fed meeting is likely to be closely tracked in cryptocurrency markets, where bitcoin has been cast by investors from both digital-asset markets and traditional finance as a potential hedge against central-bank money printing and inflation. Bitcoin prices have shot up 170% this year as the U.S. central bank expanded its total assets by more than $3 trillion to $7.3 trillion.    Risk of a new 'taper tantrum?'    With the coronavirus still taking a devastating toll on the economy, there’s little expectation that officials would move anytime soon to end the ongoing bond purchases, which are designed to provide stimulus to the economy by keeping monetary conditions ultra loose.      And, in fact, according to Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist for JPMorgan Chase, the Fed officials might even move at this week’s meeting to ease conditions further by extending the average maturity of the bonds it purchases. Such a move would theoretically put downward market pressure on long-term interest rates that tend to be the highest, making it cheaper for businesses and households to take out loans.      But Feroli noted the contrast between the new “qualitative” guidance and “quantitative” policies that might be tied to hard numerical metrics like inflation or unemployment goals.      “It could be as simple as noting that purchases would taper and cease before the first rate hike, though all this would say is they expect to cease purchases sometime before 2024, which isn’t very informative,” Feroli wrote. “A reasonable evolution of the statement language would predicate purchases on the course of the public health crisis.”      One “risk,” according to Feroli, is that traders start speculating on the timeline for broad distribution of a vaccine and perhaps then conclude bond purchases might wrap up sooner than most investors are currently anticipating.      “This sets up the risk that new guidance could spark another taper tantrum,” Feroli wrote, referring to the moment in May 2013 when bonds sold off on fear the Fed was going to taper its bond purchasing program. “A possible safeguard would be to pledge to purchase assets until 'well after’ the public health crisis passes, or some similar wording.”      According to economists at Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender after JPMorgan, thresholds for tapering the bond purchases might be “open to interpretation, however, which provides flexibility but also potentially some discomfort for market participants.”      “The Fed wants to make sure that asset purchases keep interest rates low enough and financial conditions supportive enough to help drive economic growth and deliver higher inflation,” according to the report.      Qualitatively speaking, the Fed usually gets what it wants.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/15/new-federal-reserve-qualitative-approach-could-push-further-into-experimental-realm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bac859f2b89197cf4638185ef34b12206bd99aac-1300x770.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Riot is launching an 8-megawatt immersion technology testing initiative to “assess the potential for higher productivity and lower cost mining opportunities in Texas,” per a press release. Testing is scheduled to start in Q1 2021.      If successful, CEO Jeff McGonegal told CoinDesk the company envisions ""deploying immersion at a larger scale over time, particularly in warmer climates where cooling is a chief concern.”      In high heat and humidity environments, cooling mining machines with liquid immersion instead of air cooling offer significant advantages for miners with razor-thin profit margins.      Not only does liquid cooling offer significant noise reduction compared with fan cooling. Immersion cooling can also increase usable hashrate per machine by up to 50% in some cases, prolong the lifespan of some machines and allow miners to install more machines per square foot than if the same facility used fan cooling. But maintenance can be difficult.      The mining industry is still standardized around air-cooled designs, which means air-cooled facilities are still the first choice for miners,” said Ethan Vera, co-founder of Seattle-based mining company Luxor Technology, in a direct message with CoinDesk. “But in areas of high temperature and low humidity, miners use evaporative cooling as a cost-effective strategy to mitigate the heat.”      In hot, humid regions like Texas, Vera said, liquid immersion is “the cooling method of choice as it eliminates heat, dust and humidity issues.”      In planning this pilot project, the Castle Rock, Colo.-based mining firm is “looking to observe improvements operating in difficult mining temperature environments, combined with the additional performance that can be achieved as a result,” McGonegal told CoinDesk.      Participating in Riot’s pilot program are two bitcoin mining hardware and energy software companies, Enigma and Lancium, that are providing the technology Riot plans to test.      In 2020, Riot shares have outperformed bitcoin year to date in 2020, gaining 660% since January and trading near $9.37 at last check. Over the same period, bitcoin gained 170%.

Announced Tuesday, the program includes a bitcoin rewards debit card (1.5% back), mobile app, access to ATMs, and mobile payments options like Google Pay and Apple Pay.      The bank had to receive approval from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). In July, the OCC issued a letter enabling nationally chartered banks in the U.S. to provide custody services for cryptocurrencies. Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks has hinted at more “good” actions on crypto by the end of Trump’s term.      At Quontic, customers’ bitcoin will be custodied by crypto asset manager NYDIG, which just scooped Quontic’s former chief innovation officer to serve as its head of bank solutions. Major banking software and payments technology provider FIS will build a mobile app with Quontic to track bitcoin rewards in the second quarter of 2021.      “This is the first time any bank or any core [banking system] has done anything with bitcoin that is consumer facing,” Quontic CEO Steve Schnall said in an interview.      Read more: MassMutual Buys $100M in Bitcoin, Bets on Institutional Adoption With $5M NYDIG Stake      Customers will be able to hold their bitcoin with NYDIG or redeem it in cash, Schnall said. At the moment, customers are not permitted to transfer the bitcoin to another wallet address.      Quontic is a tiny bank with only $1.4 billion in assets, about 0.044% the size of JPMorgan. In 2019, it banked a couple crypto firms. Since then, the bank has pivoted from offering bank accounts to crypto firms to trying to bring bitcoin to the masses.      “Right now we’re not banking crypto companies,” Schnall said. “For the foreseeable future, we’re just going to focus on the consumer.”      The bitcoin rewards program is initially available to residents of Alabama, Arkansas, California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New York, Pennsylvania, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

42433345,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOOXjh,1608045136,DeFi on Bitcoin Gets a Boost as Sovryn Launches on RSK Sidechain,"A new project built on the Bitcoin sidechain RSK is gunning to advance decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin’s ecosystem.      Sovryn, a self-billed “decentralized platform for trading and lending Bitcoin,” launched today with $2.1 million at its back – a symbolic number representing Bitcoin’s total supply. Crypto venture capital firm Greenfield One led the funding round, which also saw contributions from Collider Ventures and Monday Capital.      A 2-in-1 decentralized exchange and derivatives market, Sovryn will offer traders borrowing and lending service in bitcoin, USDT and RSK’s dollar on chain (DOC) stablecoin; they can also long or short bitcoin on the platform with up to 5x leverage.      ""RSK was a natural fit for Sovryn,"" said Edan Yago, Sovryn project lead. ""The team behind it share our vision for a borderless and censorship resistant digital currency. This runs right to the core of the system where transactions are secured by bitcoin miners. Now, with the addition of a smart contract layer, deploying on RSK has meant we can provide the same or better functionality than centralized services, but in a decentralized way.""      The market is the second DeFi platform to come to RSK, a year behind the DAO-like stablecoin market Money on Chain. Cloning yet another DeFi product, Sovryn plans to launch a governance token which mimics Compound Finance’s model in Q1 of 2020 with its SOV token sale.    What is a Bitcoin sidechain?    A Bitcoin sidechain is a scaling solution for Bitcoin that offloads transactions onto a network that operates independently from the primary Bitcoin network, using a 1-for-1 tokenized version of bitcoin as a native currency. These systems are sometimes called “federated networks” because they sacrifice decentralization in favor of efficiency increases like transaction speed.      Read more: RSK Is Changing How It ‘Pegs’ Bitcoin to Its Sidechain      For RSK, a group of signatories oversee the peg-in and peg-out process to convert BTC into RBTC, RSK’s tokenized version, though RSK is in the process of revamping this design. RSK processes transactions through a “merge mined” process, wherein Bitcoin miners also contribute hashrate to RSK in return for RBTC transaction fees.    DeFi on Bitcoin    Sovryn’s launch comes shortly after RSK’s MakerDAO-esque stablecoin market Money on Chain introduced liquidity mining last week.      These software rollouts have RSK sinking its teeth further into the market designs that made DeFi so hot in the summer and early fall of 2020. These financial products, a mishmash of derivatives markets, lending markets and everything in between, have found a home on Ethereum, whose programming language can accommodate more flexible smart contracts than Bitcoin’s own.      ""Sovryn, Money on Chain and RIF Dollar only represent the beginning of the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem,"" said Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, IOVlabs CEO and RSK co-founder.      ""Other than the RSK-Ethereum bridge being utilized more often, by MakerDAO and Aave for example, 2020 showed the Bitcoin ecosystem is the strongest one and where users want to be. That has led to many developers and entrepreneurs to understand they should, at the very least, create interoperable solutions to Bitcoin's open finance protocols like RSK. Bitcoin is the future of the Internet of Value, and we're excited to participate and lead it.""      Read more: Forget Ethereum, DeFi Is Being Built on Bitcoin      Sidechains like RSK have often been billed as a way to bring Ethereum-like smart contract capabilities to Bitcoin. Greenfield One partner Jascha Samadi told CoinDesk that Sovryn is definitely a “short- to mid-term play” to capture some of the lending and derivative markets volume that occurs on Ethereum-native DeFi and even centralized exchanges.      But the long play is about more than active crypto users; it’s about the crop that doesn’t have skin in the game yet.      “The long term play for DeFi on Bitcoin could be significantly larger with users (both retail and institutional) that are not in crypto yet,” Samadi wrote over email.      “At some point obviously, all these users will want to interact with DeFi applications as well, and with products like Sovryn, this will be possible right where they entered the ecosystem,” meaning in Bitcoin, rather than “having to educate them [on how to move] their BTC to Ethereum or some other ecosystem.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TOKEN SALE,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/15/defi-on-bitcoin-gets-a-boost-as-sovryn-launches-on-rsk-sidechain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d039f098a78a79e53853f2d53b336b83c2c45430-2100x1428.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42433355,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOOYJh,1608045135,Las criptomonedas crecen en la problemática economía de Argentina,"Al inicio del 2020, Ripio, una de las casas de cambios más grandes de Argentina, tenía alrededor de 400.000 usuarios. Está terminando este 2020 con más de 1 millón.      El director de marca de Ripio, Juan Mendez, dijo a CoinDesk que cerca del 70% de los usuarios de Ripio son de Argentina y el resto se concentra en Brasil. De acuerdo a Mendez, la plataforma ha presentado un aumento de hasta 10 veces en su volumen de intercambio, en comparación con el año pasado.    Read this article in English.    “He estado con la casa de cambio desde sus inicios y nunca he visto este nivel de crecimiento. Este es mucho mayor que el pico del 2017, tanto en operaciones como de la demanda,"" dijo Mendez.      Los problemas económicos de Argentina van desde enormes obligaciones de deuda hasta una alta inflación, agravada por la pandemia del COVID-19. Estos han obligado a su población a buscar nuevas alternativas para resguardar sus riquezas este año. Pero, como el gobierno ha limitado la compra de dólares norteamericanos a sus ciudadanos, las criptomonedas, rápidamente, han demostrado ser la mejor alternativa.      Además de Ripio, las casas de cambio de criptomonedas operando en Argentina han presentado récords de crecimiento en este 2020. Con algunas experimentando máximos históricos en volúmenes de intercambios en la última mitad del año.      La casa de cambio mexicana Bitso, que expandió sus operaciones a Argentina en febrero de este año, ha obtenido un 68% de incremento en sus volúmenes de comercio en el tercer trimestre, en comparación con el segundo de este 2020. La instalación de Bitso en Argentina también ayudó a que la plataforma alcanzara el millón de usuarios, al inicio de este año.      La plataforma de intercambios entre pares (P2P, por sus siglas en inglés) LocalBitcoins también presentó un incremento del 547% en sus volúmenes de intercambio entre agosto del 2019 y del 2020, con un máximo histórico de más de un millón de dólares en bitcoin intercambiados en la segunda semana de agosto de este año. Otra plataforma P2P, Paxful, mostraba casi cero volumen de intercambio en los últimos cinco años, pero el comercio empezó a crecer este año, registrando un aumento del 60.641% al compararse desde septiembre del 2019 hasta el 2020.      El crecimiento sin precedentes del comercio de criptomonedas en Argentina se refleja como una tendencia regional más amplia, ya que LocalBitcoins y Paxful también registraron máximos históricos en varios países de América del Sur, incluidos Chile, Colombia y Bolivia. Los negocios en la región son tan prósperos, que este miércoles CoinDesk reportó que Bitso recaudó la asombrosa cifra de $62 millones para financiar su expansión en Brasil.      El aumento en el uso de las criptomonedas se está generando a pesar de un contexto de devastadoras consecuencias económicas producidas por la pandemia del COVID-19. Incluso, el Banco Mundial ha declarado a América Latina y el Caribe como la región más golpeada en el mundo.      La combinación del aumento del precio de bitcoin, las economías inflacionarias (creadas desesperadamente por los países para intentar mitigar los efectos de la pandemia) y la necesidad de medios de pagos digitales más rápidos (particularmente para remesas transfronterizas) han impulsado la adopción de las criptomonedas en América del Sur este año.      Dentro de este panorama, Argentina destaca.      Comparado con economías hiperinflacionarias como Venezuela – se proyecta que para este 2020 su economía se va reducir un 6,8% – Argentina parece que enfrentará un peor desgaste, gracias en parte a una larga y complicada historia económica. En mayo, el gobierno falló el pago de $503 millones en intereses, de un bono en dólares emitidos bajo la ley de New York, colocando al país en su noveno default de deuda soberana en su historia.      El producto interno bruto (PIB) se estima que se contraerá un 12% este año, con cerca de más de la mitad de la población viviendo en pobreza.      “Las criptomonedas son, en cierta manera, aliados para los individuos, principalmente en países con un alto grado de incertidumbre política o económica,"" comentó Andrés Ondarra, Gerente de Bitso Argentina, para Coindesk por correo electrónico.    Catch-22    Los argentinos, nerviosos ante el deterioro de la economía de sus país, comenzaron a aumentar sus compras de dólares norteamericanos para resguardar su riqueza. Entonces, las reservas del país se redujeron, forzando al gobierno a devaluar su moneda y establecer restricciones en la cantidad de divisas que los ciudadanos pueden resguardar.      En septiembre, en un intento de resguardar las reducidas reservas nacionales, el banco central de Argentina limitó la cantidad de dólares norteamericanos que sus ciudadanos pueden comprar a $200 mensuales, con un impuesto del 35%.      Esto generó más problemas: después de unas difíciles negociaciones con los acreedores, el gobierno logró manejar exitosamente la restructuración de $65 mil millones de deuda externa este agosto pasado, pero debido a las preocupaciones de los inversionistas sobre las restricciones en el mercado de divisas, los nuevos bonos internacionales recién emitidos cayeron abruptamente durante septiembre y las personas siguieron comprando dólares a pesar del impuesto.      Cada vez que el peso es devaluado, las personas luchan para conseguir una manera de proteger el valor de sus salarios, agrega Mendez. Además de esto, a inicios de diciembre, el senado de Argentina aprobó un impuesto único sobre el patrimonio a los millonarios del país, para ayudar a financiar los esfuerzos de ayudas económicas ante la pandemia.      Ondarra declaró que Argentina es un mercado de criptomonedas peculiar, ya que sus usuarios siempre están la búsqueda de acceder a reservas de valor y diversas soluciones financieras.      “Los argentinos siempre están tratando de encontrar una moneda más fuerte,"" dijo Mendez.    Entrando a las criptomonedas    De acuerdo a Mendez, existe una diferencia fundamental entre los usuarios de criptomonedas en Argentina y los de Brasil, donde también opera Ripio. Las dos naciones están separadas por las fallas económicas sistémicas de Argentina a lo largo de los años, explicó.      “Argentina ha tenido que superar muchos desastres económicos a lo largo de los años. Estamos bastante acostumbrados a que fracasen los gobiernos y la planificación económica estratégica, y estamos más dispuestos a probar cosas diferentes para mantener el país a flote” afirmó Mendez.      Por ejemplo, el gobierno usualmente anuncia nuevas restricciones financieras a horas de la tarde del fin de semana (con la intención de que sean implementadas el lunes siguiente), dice Mendez.      “Entonces, durante el fin de semana y el resto de esa semana, nosotros siempre esperamos una gran demanda de criptomonedas,"" de acuerdo a Mendez.      Los argentinos ven las criptomonedas como una gran alternativa para el resguardo de valor, aunque su plataforma alerta a sus usuarios que las monedas como bitcoin son activos digitales volátiles, según Mendez.      Tanto Ondarra como Mendez están de acuerdo que la fuerte curiosidad de los argentinos sobre alternativas de reservas de valor y el aumento del conocimiento sobre criptomonedas han ayudado al crecimiento del espacio crypto local.      Pero Ondarra también atribuye el rápido crecimiento, en este año, al reciente aumento del precio.      “Un factor importante que explica el incremento en el volumen durante los últimos meses ha sido la tendencia alcista en el precio de bitcoin. Lo que indudablemente ha mantenido la atención de las personas en los movimientos del precio y ha promovido un mayor volumen de comercio,"" declaró Ondarra.      Él explica que los inversionistas de Argentina están mirando de cerca los movimientos de grandes inversionistas como MicroStrategy, quienes pasaron cerca de $500 millones de inversiones en efectivo a BTC.      Este año, Argentina se posicionó en el puesto 28 entre 154 países en el índice de adopción de criptomonedas de Chainalysis, con otros países de América Latina donde Venezuela, Colombia, Brasil y Perú se posicionan delante de Argentina.      “Está prosperando. La atención de todos se encuentra en América Latina. Y está creciendo rápido,"" dijo Méndez.      Traducido por José Rafael Peña Gholam.

42433350,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOOXth,1608044442,"Amid DeFi Hacks, Nervos and Cardano Join Forces to Improve Smart Contract Security","Public chain projects Nervos and Cardano have jointly launched a research initiative to enhance the security of smart contracts by improving Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs), one of the most common accounting methods first adopted by the Bitcoin network.      Nervos and IOHK, the development team behind Cardano, will co-author research papers on how to improve UTXO models, open source future developments, and explore the creation of a universal standard for the accounting method. They will form an alliance with other UTXO-based blockchains to help collaboration across research, development and education in the industry.      UTXO, which keeps track of a user’s unspent transactions across all their accounts and monitors every single transaction, is a more secure alternative to the account-based accounting method used by smart contract-based blockchains such as Ethereum, Nervos said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.      The account-based accounting method is more vulnerable to hacks, particularly for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, as it simply keeps track of the overall balance of a user’s account but doesn’t monitor the individual transactions within it.      Nervos and IOHK have adopted modified versions for their respective blockchains. The two projects will share proprietary information to improve the accounting method.      “UTXOs are superior to account models in many ways and provide improved security, privacy, and scalability, all of which are critical for DeFi,” said Kevin Wang, co-founder at Nervos.      Many DeFi projects rely on unaudited smart contracts with vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit, according to a report by crypto intelligence company CipherTrace.      Cardano launched a hard fork last week as part of the transition to its third major development phase, which will be focused on the blockchain’s smart contract functions, while Nervos unveiled its new token standard sUDT to compete with Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard.",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | RESEARCH | FORKS,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/15/amid-defi-hacks-nervos-and-cardano-join-forces-to-improve-smart-contract-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9161f5dd53c9feeccc52e283917e7291ff7d2faf-1600x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433353,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOOYFh,1608044153,Secret Network Launches Bridge to Bring Transactional Privacy to Ethereum,"The Secret Network, a privacy-focused blockchain, has launched its Ethereum bridge, which lets assets be transferred between Ethereum and the Secret Network privately. A bridge essentially offers interoperability between the protocols.      The Secret bridge, initially announced in December, will make privacy cheaper and more practical for Ethereum and Ethereum-based assets.      According to the blog post announcement, “it allows users to create synthetic (wrapped) ETH and ERC-20 tokens on Secret Network that can be used with full privacy, at lower cost.”      Users will need Metamask or a Keplr Wallet to interact with the bridge.      Read more: Community Behind Privacy-Focused Smart Contract Forges Ahead After Settlement      Tor Bair, the Secret Foundation’s executive director and chairman, said the biggest immediate benefit for users when it comes to this recent move is that they can gain transaction privacy. Users can turn Ethereum-based assets into Secret Tokens, which are “programmable like ERC-20s but privacy preserving like zcash or monero,” according to Bair.      Bair said the cost for ETH or ERC-20 holders using the Secret Network would be lower than using other privacy-preserving alternatives like TornadoCash, a tool for obfuscating the history of ether (ETH) transactions.      Tornado Cash uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), a cryptographic tool that proves a transaction occurred without revealing the information within the payment itself.    Secret smart contracts    The Secret Network’s key offering is the secret contract, a type of smart contract that allows private data to be used in decentralized applications without revealing the raw data. The inputs, outputs and network state are encrypted in a secret contract, which means the data is hidden even on a public blockchain. It is also invisible to the nodes executing the contract.      Read more: Secret Network’s Privacy-Focused Smart Contracts Move a Step Closer to Going Live      “In addition, you’ll be able to access upcoming decentralized finance [DeFi]applications on Secret Network, such as a front-running resistant AMM [automated market maker],” said Bair. “After launch we also plan to introduce 'bridge mining' rewards, where users of the Secret Ethereum Bridge can earn Secret Tokens for providing bridge liquidity. These rewards are available for both ETH and ERC-20s.”      The bridge will also give users access to Secret DeFi, privacy-preserving decentralized finance apps built on the Secret Network. For example, OCEAN and Secret have partnered to provide “trustless and convenient access control for Ocean datatokens as well as decentralized private compute via Secret Network.”      The full list of ERC-20 assets that are currently supported are BAND, AAVE, SNX, MKR, LINK, OCEAN, TUSD, YFI, UNI, KNC, COMP and DAI.      “Our community will be continuing to launch Secret DeFi applications that utilize Secret Tokens, especially our upcoming Secret AMM,” said Bair.      “We will also be exploring bridges and support for additional assets and ecosystems, including other Tendermint chains such as Cosmos. As a result, our AMM will feature cross-chain functionality and front-running resistance, and it will also allow you to trade Secret Tokens that are native to Secret Network.”",POSITIVE,AAVE | COMP | ETH | KNC,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | ETH | KNC,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/15/secret-network-launches-bridge-to-bring-transactional-privacy-to-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a30a8e8a90ce829886dcf964624b4f44a5fe798b-1872x1142.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433354,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOOYXh,1608041005,Why >15% of My Net Worth Is in Bitcoin,"As of this writing, the price of bitcoin is about $19,000 and, at less than 15% of my net worth, the single largest position in my portfolio. In the below paragraphs, I hope to articulate why – contrary to the common narrative – this is not crazy.    This post is part of CoinDesk's Year in Review 2020 – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Pondering Durian is a tech-focused investor and writer who explores connections between the U.S., China, and Emerging Asia (India and Southeast Asia) in the Emerging newsletter and blog.    The core narratives I use to justify my significant holdings in BTC are as follows:      Bitcoin as insurance: The probability of a reserve currency meltdown near-term is exceptionally low. However, as the probability inches up, more people will want an insurance policy. There are only 21 million bitcoins. More people wanting an insurance policy + static number of policies = price increases per policy.      Bitcoin as exit: Due to accommodative monetary policy, asset prices have not undergone their typical cycles which would have allowed millennials to access assets at affordable prices while artificially boosting the wealth of Gen X and boomers. Instead of playing in a “rigged system,” many millennials are exploring alternatives. More and more millennials will choose to “exit.”      Bitcoin as reflexivity: Bitcoin is the ultimate speculative asset. Like other forms of money, bitcoin only has value because other people believe it has value. There is a legit argument to be made that as prices increase and more people learn about the asset, the greater the probability Bitcoin will be more widely accepted, which merits a further increase in price.      Bitcoin as an “option” on digital gold: The bitcoin as digital gold metaphor is not quite right. Today it’s more of a call option on digital gold, a bet that over time, more and more investors will accept this view. Every new wave of investors which come to understand the narrative – retail investors, early adopting institutions, laggard asset managers and finally governments (in the ultimate bull case) – presents a step change in price as narrative becomes reality.      Note: I’m writing from the perspective of a millennial with a fairly high risk tolerance, lean expense structure and long-term time horizon. Clearly, the allocations would be different for a parent heading towards retirement with college tuition payments and a mortgage to fund monthly. The asset is exceptionally volatile, with a decent chance of total collapse. However, if you are able to stomach near-term volatility and are aware of the risks, the upside makes the below allocations justifiable: ~15% gold, ~15% bitcoin/ETH, ~10% cash and ~70% equities/real estate.      Let’s find out why.    The world we live in    The only way to understand why this allocation makes sense is to zoom out and take in the big picture. There is a war going on, the accelerating deflationary forces of technology vs. the inflation-desperate central banks. A reflexive loop has formed:      The avenues for paying back the massive government debts now building are austerity, restructuring, faster GDP growth or devaluing the currency. Austerity is politically untenable and often limits GDP growth hurting debt to GDP ratios.      Furthermore, GDP growth is hard to come by in our stagnating, debt-laden economies. Restructuring would likely be catastrophic to the existing financial system. Devaluing the currency is the only realistic, politically tenable option. Growing GDP and controlled inflation are the means by which central banks have typically reduced debt burdens. Stimulus – providing cheap credit – has been the tool of choice. However, the ever-increasing stimulus is having a diminishing impact. We need more and more cheap debt to buy $1 of GDP growth.    Against the backdrop of this monetary and fiscal circus, bitcoin’s narratives are finding their way into more and more portfolios.    Debt growth is outpacing GDP growth, which means the best option to stabilize the debt/GDP ratio is stoking inflation.      However, in recent years, inflation has been hard to come by despite quantitative easing on a global scale: the U.S. Federal Reserve has missed its 2% inflation target in eight of the last 12 years since the global financial crisis. This seems to be brought on by an increasing debt overhang as well as the deflationary forces of technology.      As Jeff Booth points out in “The Price of Tomorrow,” the easiest place to see the deflationary forces of technology is your smartphone. What would have previously been a separate collage of supercomputer + flashlight + calculator + wallet + camera + television + yellow pages + a zillion other things now fits into your pocket for prices affordable for billions. You get more for less. Many things today are basically free.      The deflationary forces of exponential digitization vs. central banks desperate to stoke inflation to pay back their large debt burdens. The key economic struggle of the 21st Century.      Based on rates of inflation, tech seems to have the upper hand.Our government’s response? More stimulus.      Clearly, this cannot go on forever, but it will last longer than many people think. Let’s look at the winners and losers of this current monetary regime.    The one-eyed king    Clearly, in a monetary regime of near-zero interest rates, savers are hit hard and yields on bonds turn progressively negative (in real or even nominal terms). The increased liquidity in the system has not flowed to goods and services (causing inflation) but is flowing into the equity markets (inflating asset prices – the only place with real returns to act as a store-of-value for future spending). The more money printed (or cheap debt issued), the higher equity prices are likely to go given the lack of alternatives in other asset classes to store wealth.      If you look at the equity indices globally since the unprecedented quantitative easing (QE) after the 2008 financial crisis, I think the trend is pretty clear.      If you believe we will continue to be in a deflationary environment (which seems likely given the increasing role of tech) and you believe governments will try desperately to stoke inflation (which they will because it is the least painful way to “repay debts”) and you believe their tools for stoking inflation are limited largely to more stimulus (which appears to be the case), then this trend will continue.      In that case, equities – with decent exposure to tech (adjusting for valuation) – seem like a good place to play ball. Hence my 70% weighting (as a young person with a long-term outlook).      How long can this cycle last?      As I mentioned in a previous post, it could last until the U.S. dollar (USD) loses its status as the global reserve currency. In short, for quite some time.      I think the below excerpt from my newsletter back in June explains the dynamic well:    To quote 15th century Dutch philosopher Desiderius Erasmus, “In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.” In 2020, the U.S. is the one-eyed king.    Despite poor fiscal and monetary practices, near-zero interest rates and an increasingly ailing balance sheet, demand for dollars and Treasury bonds remains strong. There is simply nowhere else to go.      Japan has been stagnating since the 1990s with a debt/GDP ratio of ~230%. The European Union is following suit and the very existence of the monetary union is in question. There is a high probability the euro doesn’t see 2030. Pound sterling is a relic from a colonial past and is rapidly being weaned from reserves. While China has a healthier government balance sheet, there are strict capital controls for a reason. It’s doubtful China will rapidly open its financial borders after the strong outflow pressures witnessed in 2015 and 2016. The rule of law is still too arbitrary.      That leaves the U.S.      Even with the record stimulus, there is an “insatiable demand” for U.S. treasuries. From the Financial Times on a possible additional $3 trillion in U.S. government borrowing:      Financial markets have so far had little difficulty in digesting the supply, with Treasury yields ticking slightly higher but still hovering close to record lows. The 10-year note now trades at 0.67 percent, roughly 1 percentage point lower than where it began the year…      There is a seemingly insatiable demand for U.S. dollar debt. There is little to suggest that the Treasury [Dept.] will have any issue funding [the government]”      The U.S. is still the only game in town.      These current trends, the central bank remedy and the sticky nature of reserve currency status points to a bull case for the continued expansion of global equities. If this base case happens, a majority equities portfolio will do well, and gold will underperform but still likely appreciate slowly.    To hedge against the downside, a mixture of cash, gold and bitcoin seem compelling.    However, a lot of smart people are starting to analyze this cycle and concluding it cannot last forever. Ray Dalio’s extended debt cycle will need to unwind slowly or pop. Unfortunately, while still a ways off, the short-term nature of our four-year election cycle makes the latter scenario increasingly likely. Populism is in. Technocrats are out.      To hedge against the downside, a mixture of cash, gold and bitcoin seem compelling. USD in the event of a non-catastrophic downturn, gold in the event of a non-catastrophic or catastrophic downturn and BTC in the event of a catastrophic downturn, but with simultaneous upside characteristics near-term as penetration grows.    Bitcoin narratives    Considering this backdrop, a not-insignificant allocation to BTC strikes me as justifiable. If you are wrong, then equities will likely continue to perform well and your portfolio should be fine. Even if it goes to zero, you will not be on the street.      Despite being young and extremely risky, bitcoin’s narratives resonate with me. Assuming others think similarly, there is a lot of upside in being in early.    Bitcoin as insurance    As stated above, bitcoin could be seen as a put option on continued irresponsible monetary and fiscal policy – surging in price when the extended debt cycle finally pops. Foreign governments eventually balk at buying U.S. Treasurys as debts continue to pile up.      Under this scenario, the financial system would likely have a catastrophic collapse leading to a scramble for “hard money,” of which bitcoin (along with gold) is a leading candidate. Still, reserve currencies are notoriously sticky; the above scenario is unlikely to play out on a medium-term time horizon. What is more likely is …    Bitcoin as an option on digital gold    As more investors piece together the above reflexive loop, they will explore allocations to protect their downside. Gold has clearly been a recent favorite. However, BTC’s current market cap is just ~$350 billion (at time of this writing) relative to gold at ~$10 trillion. As the narrative around “digital gold” continues to gain adoption, step change increases in value are possible as different waves of investors decide to take a bet on the narrative. As historian Niall Ferguson notes, if all the world’s millionaires decide a ~1% portfolio allocation to bitcoin is worth the hedge, then the price per coin is ~$75,000.    Bitcoin as exit    There is growing discontent among millennials with expanding inequality. The low returns to labor and the monetary shenanigans that are propping up asset prices beyond their grasps are key drivers. While the increasing popularity of hard left politicians like U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is one symptom, crypto provides a more libertarian option. “If the existing system isn’t working for me and protects the wealth of my parents and baby boomers, then it's time to play in a new sandbox.” Crypto is the new sandbox with algorithmically transparent rules of play. As cohorts age, more people and dollars will find themselves in the crypto sandbox.    Bitcoin as reflexivity    As readers of my newsletter know, I’m a fan of George Soros’ reflexivity framework – essentially that subjective and objective reality are intertwined and dynamic. I believe in 2020 we are reaching an era of peak reflexivity, and bitcoin is the ultimate reflexive asset. Perfectly crafted to ride these trends.      As Naval Ravikant put it: “Money is the bubble that never pops. It’s a consensus hallucination.”      I’m bullish on bitcoin because of the unique technical properties ensuring scarcity but even more so because of the hard-core evangelical following. Many will never sell. More folks getting religion + constrained supply = a one-way impact on price.      At the end of the day, humans are social creatures and use narratives to derive meaning. Bitcoin presents a compelling narrative to many people, especially those below the age of 40. The top-heavy baby boomer demographic disparages it, the same people who will be gone when the massive debt bills finally come due.      See also: Hong Fang - The Complete Case for $100K Bitcoin      This narrative isn’t for them.      Crypto is a vehicle outside of the existing political system to serve as a forcing function – a mechanism to exit the old game headed for bankruptcy and start a new one which cannot be co-opted politically. It has the potential to serve as the massive intergenerational wealth transfer which never happened under the current system because the Fed keeps propping up asset prices.      A fresh start.      Against the backdrop of this monetary and fiscal circus, bitcoin’s narratives are finding their way into more and more portfolios.      At some point, the hallucination just becomes reality.

42385352,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAwKbl,1608040767,First Mover: Reminiscing on Pre-Pandemic Bitcoin as Rally Stalls,"Bitcoin (BTC) was rising for a fourth straight day, though in a repeat of last week's action the cryptocurrency struggled to push above $20,000 after its months-long rally from a low around $5,000 in March.      ""The level of $20,000, which is commonly equated with bitcoin's all-time high, represents a massive psychological barrier and could likely require a lot of force to break through,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, wrote in his newsletter.      In traditional markets, Asian stocks fell the most in two weeks but European equities were steady. U.S. stocks pointed to a higher open after a four-day slump. According to Bloomberg News, investors were pricing in optimism about a vaccine rollout while harboring doubts on the latest efforts by U.S. lawmakers to negotiate a new stimulus bill. The so-called third wave of the coronavirus is leading to new lockdown measures. Gold strengthened 1% to $1,846 an ounce.    Market moves    (Editor's note: This is the second installment of First Mover's recap of how the bitcoin market evolved over the course of 2020 and what it means for the future. Today we cover January and February, just before the fast-spreading coronavirus began to take its toll on the global economy, sending markets into a tailspin and leading to an unprecedented financial response from governments and central banks around the world.)       Trillions of dollars of money-printing this year by the Federal Reserve and other central banks have galvanized bitcoin's use as a hedge against currency debasement by investors from both cryptocurrency markets and traditional finance.      But even before the pandemic-related economic stimulus hit global markets, economists were already openly speculating whether the U.S. dollar could survive another decade as the world's dominant currency for international payments and foreign reserves.      Historically, after all, a catalyst always led to one currency supplanting another as the world’s most important medium of transaction, unit of accounting and store of value. The U.S. dollar had emerged as the world’s leading currency during the early 20th century when it took over from debt-strapped Britain’s pound; a century before that, Holland’s guilder was undone by the French Emperor Napoleon’s invasion.      In early 2020, China's proposed digital currency was seen as a potential threat to the greenback, and former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney had gone so far as to propose a ""synthetic hegemonic currency,"" potentially provided ""through a network of central bank digital currencies.""      “There’s a lot of discussion of substitutes for the dollar as the global reserve currency,” Bill Adams, senior international economist for the U.S. bank PNC, told CoinDesk around the start of the year.      But based on officials tallies of the dollar's share of global foreign reserves, the U.S. currency looked as strong as ever.      It didn't take long for the bitcoin market to get a jolt – after a U.S. drone strike killed a top Iranian commander during the first week of January, fueling speculation that heightened geopolitical turmoil might spur demand for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin jumped to $7,300, as analysts said it might serve as a safe-haven asset similar to gold, whose value is expected to hold in times of geopolitical or economic instability.      The flap soon faded from the news and crypto traders turned to what they thought would be the bitcoin market's marquee event of the year – the once-every-four-years ""halving"" that would take place in May, where the pace of new supply of cryptocurrency issued from the Bitcoin network gets cut by 50%. It's stipulated in the 11-year-old blockchain's underlying programming.      From December through February, Google searches on the term ""bitcoin halving"" doubled in a month to the highest levels since 2016, and some enthusiasts even created a dedicated website, bitcoinblockhalf.com, to count down the remaining days, hours, minutes and seconds until it happens.      Cryptocurrency lenders reported a quickening pace of customer activity, in some cases more than 10 times the loan growth reported by big banks like JPMorgan Chase. The traditional financial companies were tethered to the broad economy, where U.S. growth had slowed to a 2.3% expansion in 2019 from the 2.9% clip in 2018. (A newly launched futures contract focused on the U.S. presidential election, launched by the cryptocurrency exchange FTX in early February, suggested Donald Trump had a 62% chance of winning.)      Crypto traders bandied about analyst predictions the halving could send prices skyrocketing to $90,000 or higher.      They had no idea, of course, how dramatically the events of the ensuing months would reshape the global economic outlook. By late February, traders saw clearly just how far bitcoin was from being a safe haven – as prices tumbled alongside U.S. stocks as authorities globally struggled to stem the spread of the coronavirus beyond China. U.S. Treasury bonds, seen as a traditional safe-haven asset, rallied, as did gold.      Bitcoin is ""not the same as owning Treasury, and not the same as owning gold,” the cryptocurrency analyst Greg Cipolaro told CoinDesk on Feb. 24.      Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of the crypto-focused firm Arca Funds in Los Angeles, raised the prospect of a separate potential catalyst for higher bitcoin prices: Monetary-policy easing by the Federal Reserve to stimulate coronavirus-infected markets.      “I don’t expect bitcoin to trade as risk-on or risk-off asset,” he said. “But over a longer period of time, anything that’s inflationary, or said another way devalues other currencies, strengthens the purchasing power of bitcoin.”      That view would take hold in the bitcoin market over the rest of the year, attracting the notice of mutual-fund companies like Fidelity Investments and BlackRock, hedge funds including Tudor Investment and more recently the 169-year-old insurance company MassMutual.      Prices have nearly tripled in 2020 to near $20,000.      Iran rarely came up again in bitcoiners' conversations about the market, and these days, there's barely any market talk about the halving. Now, it's all about the money printing. Questions remain about the future of the dollar.      Coming Wednesday: The coronavirus hits, and bitcoin prices tank – until the Federal Reserve arrives and embarks on the biggest money-printing episode of its 107-year history.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin again failed to hold gains above $19,500 early Tuesday, possibly due to profit-taking by large Asia-based investors, according to one analyst.      In the two hours between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. coordinated universal time (UTC), the cryptocurrency fell from about $19,500 to about $19,050. An increased inflow of coins onto the crypto exchange Huobi Global, which has a Hong Kong presence, was observed before prices began falling.      ""A total of 2,013 coins were transferred to Huobi in blocks 661,425 to 661,430 just 15 minutes before the price dip,” said Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, adding that block number 661,425 carried 1,017 coins, the highest single-block inflow on Huobi since Nov. 30. Monday saw 8,836 BTC arrive on Huobi in total, with a mean transaction of 4.5 BTC, the highest since March 2018, according to CryptoQuant.      The uptick in the average size of exchange deposits indicates that larger investors were transferring their coins to Huobi and may have liquidated their holdings around $19,500, a level that has acted as stiff resistance of late.      At press time, bitcoin has rebounded to near $19,300, and the path of least resistance for the cryptocurrency remains to the upside, according to analysts. However, forcing a breakout above $20,000 in the short term may prove to be an uphill task for the bulls, since there are sizable sell orders open in the approach to a new record high spot price.      “There are still offers above $19,500 up to $20,000,” Patrick Heusser, head of trading at the Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, told CoinDesk. “The US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase shows 700 bitcoin for sale right at $20,000, but all other exchanges show some offers up there as well in the region of 200-300 coins.”      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin May Have Hit Wall of Profit Takers Around $19,500    What's hot    Mt.

42385351,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAwKZF,1608031489,"Bitcoin May Have Hit Wall of Profit Takers Around $19,500: Analyst","Bitcoin's ascent above $19,500 was cut short early on Tuesday, possibly due to profit taking by large Asia-based investors, according to one analyst.      The top cryptocurrency fell from $19,555 to $19,035, with most of the drop unfolding during the two hours to 06:00 UTC, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      ""I think Asian whales sold around $19,500 causing prices to drop,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk, referring to those with big crypto holdings. He highlighted an increased inflow of coins onto crypto exchange heavyweight Huobi Global, which has a Hong Kong presence, soon before prices began falling.      ""A total of 2,013 coins were transferred to Huobi in blocks 661,425 to 661,430 just 15 minutes before the price dip,"" Ju said, adding that block number 661,425 carried 1,017 coins, the highest single-block inflow on Huobi since Nov. 30.      Monday saw 8,836 BTC arrive on Huobi in total, with a mean transaction of 4.5 BTC, the highest since March 2018, according to CryptoQuant.      The uptick in the average size of exchange deposits indicates that larger investors were transferring their coins to Huobi and may have liquidated their holdings around $19,500, a level which has acted as stiff resistance of late.      Bitcoin has failed multiple times to establish a foothold above that point since Nov. 25, thought to be largely due to some investors booking profits on fears of a near-term sell-off.      At press time, bitcoin has rebounded to near $19,300 and the path of least resistance for the cryptocurrency remains to the higher side, according to analysts.      The options market sees a 35% probability of bitcoin ending December above $20,000, according to data source Skew. That's significantly higher than the single-digit probability seen three months ago when bitcoin was trading near $10,000. Some investors look to have bought call options at the $20,000 strike price on Monday.      Skew data shows the open interest or the number of open positions in the bullish $20,000 call rose by 1,054 contracts on Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange by volume and open interest.      However, forcing a breakout above $20,000 in the short term may prove to be an uphill task for the bulls, as there are sizable sell orders open in the approach to a new record high spot price.

42385339,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAwKNv,1608025103,OCC Economist Cites Benefits of Issuing Bank Charters to Stablecoin Providers,"The chief economist of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a banking regulator within the U.S. Treasury, believes issuing national bank charters to ""fintech shadow banks"" could bring ""substantial advantages.""      In a paper titled ""Chartering the FinTech Future,"" Charles Calomiris set out how stablecoin providers chartered as banks that do not rely on funding from deposits would themselves gain advantages from regulatory oversight.      Such companies would benefit by ""coming out of the shadows,"" he wrote, with geographic reach and market credibility outweighing the added cost burden of regulation.      The banking system and its consumers would also benefit, according to Calomiris, evolving over the next decades with the added advantages of efficiency, convenience and stability from a regulated network of ""stable value coin banks issuing non-depository liabilities.""      ""It would be desirable to allow such banks to obtain national bank charters,"" Calomiris concluded.      The term ""shadow banking"" refers to financial middlemen who provide credit within the global financial system but are not subject to regulatory oversight. Stablecoin issuers are considered such entities in the paper.      ""At the OCC, we know that new technologies and consumer preferences, not regulators, will decide the future of banking,"" wrote Calomiris.    Future threats    Calomiris' paper also examined the U.S. Federal Reserve's grip on monetary power and its potential to oppose fintech banks.      ""The Federal Reserve is a very powerful organization that stands to lose its monopoly over the payment system as blockchain-based networks develop,"" wrote Calomiris. ""One can hope that the Fed will be guided more by public interest than a desire to preserve its own power.""      Calomiris wrote that as far as he was aware, the Fed had not yet taken an official position on fintech chartering. ""Time will tell,"" he wrote.      But he suggested that politics as much as economics will decide whether consumers will ever benefit from a ""chartered FinTech future.""      ""When considering whether FinTech shadow banks, including stable coin providers, will eventually become an important part of the chartered banking system, it is crucial to take into account the political power of the special interests who stand to lose from doing so,"" Calomiris said.      The OCC, under the leadership of former Coinbase executive Brian Brooks, has recently taken a notably crypto-friendly stance in its policies. In July, the OCC issued a letter enabling nationally chartered banks in the U.S. provide custody services for cryptocurrencies.      Brooks was also reported to be pushing forward a plan to offer national banking charters to payment firms that don’t take deposits in September. Brooks said at the time, it could potentially consider companies like PayPal and Coinbase.      In recent months, a number of crypto and blockchain firms have applied to the OCC become federally regulated banks in the U.S., including BitPay, Anchorage and Paxos. Kraken and Avanti have already become the first crypto-native banks in the U.S., though they secured state charters from the Wyoming Division of Banking, not federally via the OCC.      See also: Paxos Becomes Latest Crypto Firm to File for Federal Bank Charter      In the paper, Calomiris said the OCC is also considering extending the national bank charter to include stablecoin providers.

42385344,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAwKSx,1608022323,How Israeli VCs Are Doubling Down on DeFi Startups,"The three co-founders of Collider Ventures all agree Israel’s vibrant crypto industry waned, yet didn’t fizzle, throughout 2020.      “For us, [COVID-19] had a positive impact that pushed us into a corner, and we decided to start Collider Labs in order to become sustainable,” said Collider Ventures co-founder Adam Benayoun, describing how his firm raised over $1 million for a separate accelerator fund.      As such, Collider Labs is exploring a different way for venture capitalists to invest in decentralized finance (DeFi), at a time when bitcoin is captivating local attention. Israeli blockchain consultant Maya Zehavi said via direct message that local investors are now “more pro-bitcoin than any other crypto,” with a penchant for custody services or cryptography.      This is a notable departure from the last bull run of 2017, when Israeli entrepreneurs rushed to use Ethereum to raise enormous sums for their fledgling token projects.      The change in mood is perhaps reflected in a more bitcoin-centric view of what DeFi can offer. Similar to the leading Japanese crypto companies, Israel’s DeFi scene is more inclined toward bitcoin-based solutions than the Ethereum builders of Silicon Valley.    Collider’s approach    Avishay Ovadia, who spearheads Collider Labs, said in a phone interview his Israeli accelerator program only accepts one startup at a time. Ovadia previously shepherded the Israeli crypto startup Portis until it got acquired in 2020. Now he’s focused on the DeFi startup Sovryn, run by Israeli expats in London. Ovadia said he works part time at the participating startups for up to two years.      In exchange for ample time and $75,000, Ovadia said, the sister venture fund takes roughly 5% of the startup’s equity and a comparable amount of tokens (if the startup has a token). Benayoun added the venture fund views any prospective token earnings as illiquid for much longer than the two-year program.      “We don’t have bitcoin or ether in our portfolio, like a hedge fund, but we’re going to run a validator for the RSK Network,” Ovadia said, referencing the bitcoin-adjacent network that Sovryn’s DeFi solution relies on. “We think RSK is in a better position to bring more bitcoin maximalists into DeFi, because you don’t need to convert to ether.”      Skeptics like BHB Network co-founder Giacomo Zucco say RSK’s connections to bitcoin are debatable at best.      “The fact that RSK issued its own ‘native token’ made my [skepticism] even stronger,” Zucco said in a direct message.      But even this staunch purist admitted he would prefer an RSK-based solution over an Ethereum-based DeFi offering, if a given situation required some type of DeFi tool. All things considered, the six-person Collider team managed to keep its financial goals on target throughout 2020, according to co-founder Ofer Rotem, by narrowing its focus.      “We’ll only work with two or three companies per quarter,” Ovadia said      This pace offers a stark contrast to the Chicago DeFi Alliance (CDA), which already churned out dozens of alumni. Ovadia also said portfolio companies like IDEX are welcome to simultaneously participate in programs run by the Chicago DeFi Alliance. The Israeli program is focused on business and engineering, not trading, like its counterpart in Chicago.    Staying lean    “We want to learn from those that failed,” Rotem said, declining to specifically name any of the dozen Israeli blockchain companies that have folded or had massive layoffs since 2017.      “They tried to build these huge conglomerates from scratch and it didn’t work out well for them. They grew too fast and hired too many people,” Rotem said. “We’re all on lean salaries. We’re not eating our budget.”      Slowly but steadily, Rotem said, his venture fund still invests in roughly one startup every six weeks, even during Israel’s unusually strict pandemic lockdowns. One of the firm’s previous investments, the wallet startup KZen, is on track to turn a profit next year, according to KZen CEO Ouriel Ohayon.      Ohayon said that before the lockdowns, his team worked in the same office as its investors and often collaborated. Now, because the startup is a bit more mature, the team has switched to a remote-first approach. He said KZen, which was founded in 2018 and launched the ZenGo Android app in January 2020, benefited greatly from hands-on investor attention during the first two years.      “Close to $100 million of crypto funds moved through our wallets. It’s nothing compared to Binance, but we only really started this year,” Ohayon said in a video interview. “The crypto space in Israel has changed enormously in the past few years. It shrank [but] now you have maybe up to 10 good companies and three to 10 good investors. They [Collider Ventures] are among the few that stayed in the space after the Israeli crypto ecosystem shrank.”    Long-term plan    Collider’s co-founders said it will take at least a decade to complete the returns on the investments they’ve started.      “We asked investors to lock their funds for eight years, which was unusual,” Benayoun said.      He said his firm will help build DeFi tools for people who are bullish on DeFi, like themselves, to weather market swings such as the infamous ""Black Thursday"" price plunge this past March.      “I learned the hard way. I invested in a fund that lost 70% of its money on Black Thursday because of bad risk management, so that accelerated our efforts to create a way to invest with better risk management,” Benayoun said.      The DeFi space can be especially risky, even compared to other crypto sectors. Plus, Ovadia said, the team didn’t have a trusted recommendation when the fund’s investors asked how to participate in Ethereum staking. As such, the lab’s second startup slot will go to a staking project.      “These companies in the lab are solving problems that we saw,” Ovadia said. “It’s a solution that we will use.”      His firm often focuses on companies with modest rounds, under $10 million, and staff under 20 people. Unlike 2017, Israel now has an unemployment rate over 20% and an economy paralyzed by the pandemic. It may continue being a Middle Eastern blockchain hub, if remaining bitcoin advocates focus on helping local fintech powerhouses enter the DeFi market with calculated risks.      “In 10 years from now, we’ll probably just be called a fintech fund,” Benayoun said. “We were able to raise during the bear market, and when things were slowing down during the pandemic we doubled down. We’re very committed.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/15/how-israeli-vcs-are-doubling-down-on-defi-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ccc3086d3bc5868f857ee6cb581859fb92f7588-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A commercial distribution agreement to start offering Conio’s services to Banca Generali customers in 2021 has also been signed, the companies said.      There were some smaller investors in the Series B round but they were not made public. Banca Generali accounted for the vast majority of the raise, said a Conio representative, declining to give the exact figure.      Prior to this round, Conio raised $3 million in seed investment at the end of 2015 led by Poste Italiane, and then a $3.5 million round in mid-2018 from various investors including Banca Sella.      For now, the bank’s custody solution will only offer bitcoin, said Michele Seghizzi, head of marketing and external relations at Banca Generali, adding that in terms of disposable wealth, the bank’s customers range from about $500,000 to about $10 million.      “Right now it’s just bitcoin,” Seghizzi said in an interview. “We decided to focus on the main digital currency that makes up most of the market and get all the security correct. They [Conio] are open to enlarging the service to other digital currencies in the future.”    Crypto Italiano    Earlier this year, Conio provided a wallet integration with Italian challenger bank Hype, which allowed some 1.2 million mobile banking customers to buy, sell and store bitcoin from within their banking app, rather like Revolut in the U.K.      “What we are doing with Banca Generali is similar to Hype,” said Christian Miccoli, co-founder of Conio, “but on a much larger scale.”      Read more: 85% of Italian Banks Are Exchanging Interbank Transfer Data on Corda      The multisig solution involves each Banca Generali client being issued a private key that is stored on their phone, while the second and third keys are held by the bank and Conio, respectively. That way if the customer loses their key the funds can still be recovered, Miccoli said.      MassMutual, a large U.S. insurance group that recently bought $100 million in bitcoin, has caused rumblings about insurance firms in Europe also looking at crypto investing. So might Banca’s parent company, Generali Group, which controls about $625 billion in assets, be thinking along similar lines?      “You’d have to ask them that,” said Seghizzi.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/15/banca-generali-leads-14m-round-in-italian-crypto-custody-firm-conio,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f300f218a0c6f364918796e260e2ad66eb762d9-854x568.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
