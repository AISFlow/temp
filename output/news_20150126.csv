42398145,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShFS,1422306315,"Volatility, Deflation and Manipulation: A Response to Bitcoin's Critics","Bitcoin has its share of critics and skeptics, and opposition to the emerging technology – especially among the intelligentsia – shows no sign of abating.  Notable commentators on the topic range from author Jeffrey Robinson to finance blogger Karl Denninger, Boston University professor Mark Williams, rabid Keynesian Paul Krugman, Austrian economist Gary North and FT Alphaville's Izabella Kaminska.  Generously, I'm assuming that the pundits listed above have a thorough and accurate understanding of the bitcoin protocol that facilitates its native token's dual role of currency and commodity.  Typically, the arguments put forth by an elite group of critics like this could be easily attributed to a lack of economic credentials or real-world experience in sophisticated financial markets. But that is simply not the case here – which makes it all the more puzzling to comprehend. Since the various critiques fall short on any convincing economic analysis, I suppose one could put it down to mere philosophical differences on the origin and nature of money.  With the resilience of distributed peer-to-peer networks amplified by powerful public key cryptography, we are all in new territory now; the world stands on the precipice of a fundamental realignment in the transfer of value. At its root, bitcoin is a value transfer protocol. We may voluntarily choose to utilize it or not. Most importantly, there is no coercion imposed through legal tender laws.  Value is subjective  Perhaps most disturbing to the bitcoin critics is the fundamental myth that bitcoin exposes – the myth that the State confers value on money and that we need 'kings' to coin our money.  We are constantly reminded by the critics that money can only be a legal creature of the State and that it is the ""civil society system which puts the value into currency"". Expounding on the thesis advanced by German economist Georg Friedrich Knapp in The State Theory of Money (1924), an exposé advocating the Chartalist approach to monetary theory claiming that money must have no intrinsic value and strictly be used as tokens issued by the government, these modern-day chartalists promote the notion that only governments and sovereign issuers have the ability to confer legitimacy to money.  A belief in central banking is also a belief in the central planning of an economy. Additionally, it represents central planning of the highest order, because it interferes with the market's price discovery process for money – the rate of interest.  As the antithesis of central planning in money, bitcoin gradually achieves more and more market-based legitimacy. Institutional and government legitimacy are not required for bitcoin to serve as store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account.  Kaminska's first piece on bitcoin in early 2013 highlighted a fairly good interaction between Chris Cook and an Austrian economist on the intrinsic value debate. Here's more on subjective and intrinsic value with Willem Buiter, chief economist at Citi.  Volatility is a red herring  But wait, isn't all this volatility damaging bitcoin and its reliability as a store of value and medium of exchange?  As bitcoin grows and matures, multi-jurisdictional exchanges will emerge which also include specialized derivatives products for hedging risk and this will have the effect of increasing market capitalization and smoothing out price volatility. Bitcoin swaps are already being conducted over swap execution facilities.  Although important, the speculative volatility is actually a sideshow to the main event of bitcoin establishing a footing in the financial world. Even at a mere six years old, bitcoin exhibits no more volatility than the luminary Swiss franc or North Sea Brent crude oil, with the latter losing more than 50% of its value in about six months.  Fear not deflation  But what about the hoarding of bitcoin? Isn't that bad for its use as money?  I prefer to call it savings and maybe it's time to unlearn all those lessons taught in school. Savings and deflation are not bad for an economy. As Jörg Guido Hülsmann once said: ""We should not be afraid of deflation. We should love it as much as our liberties.""  Contrary to the central banking and political class insistence that deflation must be prevented at all costs, an economy with a monetary unit that increases in value over time provides significant economic benefits such as near-zero interest rates and increasing demand through lower prices.  Ultimately, the market will reach an equilibrium between investment and savings because in the absence of an equilibrium the benefits of a savings-only strategy would evaporate. Proper economic growth through sound investments will lead to a productivity-driven deflation.  Ironically, it's the store of value function for bitcoin which enables and reinforces its use as a medium of exchange. According to Daniel Krawisz of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, hoarders give bitcoin value and he states that ""the initial price of bitcoin was caused by people who wanted to hold it, not people who wanted to spend it. Furthermore, each subsequent step in bitcoin’s advance must begin with more holders, not more spenders.""  No naked shorts, so far  I am continually amazed by those who shout ""market manipulation"" yet fail to see the very blatant manipulation they abhor present in the naked short selling of precious metals and in the Plunge Protection Team. We all know the world's most important trading desk sits on the 9th floor of 33 Liberty Street.  Kaminska writes: ""Bitcoin markets are a hotbed for unscrupulous market practices. Everything from HFT, front-running, rebating, preferential order flow, poor margining, naked shorting, and now the truly popular one – active 'collusion' by big players. It’s all there.""  In reading this, you would be forgiven in thinking that Kaminska might also be referring to highly-regulated markets populated by the likes of MF Global and the interest rate rigging cartel of RBS, Citigroup and JP Morgan. She is not. Certainly Kaminska doesn't condone that type of market activity, but that's not really the point.  The point is that we have a brand new marketplace, for a digital bearer instrument no less, germinating in parallel to the entrenched incumbents and along the way battling the retail and wholesale payments oligarchy as well as the vested interests of legal tender threatening bans. Of course, the bitcoin exchange markets experience illiquidity, lack of market depth, and a few bad actors willing to exploit such conditions. They are in the vanguard of cryptographic security architecture for dynamically-connected bearer wallets.  Fraud on any level, whether State-sponsored or from malicious principals, has no excuse and should not be tolerated. The solution is not to ensconce the new exchanges in the straight-jacket of the perceived level playing field with too-big-to-fail benefits and socialized losses, but to encourage multiple competitive exchanges across multiple jurisdictions. We wouldn't have the COMEX tail wagging the spot market dog if we had robust precious metals derivatives markets on every continent.  With bitcoin and exchanges, it's all about jurisdictional arbitrage.  Should we really believe that the two young founders of Bitstamp match the antics of Jon Corzine? After all, episodes like Bitstamp are not due to an orchestrated crisis of liquidity.  But who will protect the people?  The European Banking Authority published their report on virtual currencies complete with a risk drivers chart of 70 bitcoin risks, which was promptly hailed by the FT Bitcoinmania crowd.  For a sane and thoughtful response, we turn to Ken Tindell, who believes that the ""EBA’s considered opinion is that European financial institutions should shun bitcoin like a dead skunk and go nowhere near it until the 'scheme operators' are persuaded to change bitcoin to be managed by a wise and omniscient regulator."" He concludes that the EBA doesn't really understand bitcoin and they exaggerate the risks to support a mandate which deters financial innovation unless it fits into their limited construct.  In the United States, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau did the same thing with the publishing of its advisory warning to consumers about the risks of virtual currencies.  To better assist consumers, I described some of bitcoin's superior attributes in the area of financial protection, because when the words 'financial protection' are in your agency's official name, it appears disingenuous to omit features from what may be one of the world's most protective financial instruments ever designed.  In no particular order, bitcoin provides protection from counterfeit bank notes, protection from financial surveillance, protection from identity theft, protection from physical loss of assets, protection from cross-border restrictions and excessive fees, protection from payments blockades, protection from government-sponsored inflation, and protection from confiscation. Can your currency do all that?  Furthermore, without a central bank and without taxpayer-funded deposit insurance, it is somewhat comforting to know that bitcoin's lender of last resort is the same as the lender of last resort for gold – those silly believers of subjective value.  In the province of financial journalism, bitcoin unmasks the Statists.  Follow the author on Twitter.

42398157,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShQH,1422293794,Bitcoin Ransomware Now Spreading via Spam Campaigns,"Security firms McAfee Labs and Symantec have issued warnings that a type of bitcoin-demanding ransomware, CTB-Locker, is now being propagated through spam campaigns.  The malware, the name of which stands for 'Curve Tor Bitcoin Locker', was first identified last year. However, the spam distribution approach appears to be a relatively new development.  McAfee published its latest advisory last week, describing CTB-Locker as a form of ransomware that encrypts files on the target computer. Anecdotal evidence suggests .jpg image files are a frequent target. The victim then has to pay a ransom to have the files decrypted.  Symantec said in a recent blog  that the process of dealing with crypto malware is “particularly nasty to deal with”.  How it works  Upon installation, CTB-Locker injects malicious code into the 'svchost.exe' file, creating a scheduled task for moving and encrypting files.  The malware encrypts the compromised files using elliptical curve encryption, which appears to be equivalent to RSA encryption with a 3,072-bit key.  Once the encryption is complete, the user is informed of the attack through a pop-up ransom message.  The message displays a 96-hour countdown. If the user does not pay the bitcoin ransom within 96 hours, the decryption key is destroyed and the files remain permanently encrypted.  The pop-up allows the user to see the list of encrypted files, along with information on how to make a payment and get the decryption code.  Detection, infection and propagation vectors  McAfee detects CTB-Locker under three different names: BackDoor-FCKQ, Downloader-FAMV and Injector-FMZ. Symantec identifies the final payload as Trojan.Cryptolocker.E.  The malware is being propagated via spam campaigns, as a .zip archive stored within another .zip file. The zipped file contains the downloader for CTB-Locker.  So far, researchers have uncovered the following names used to store the downloader:  malformed.zip  plenitude.zip  inquires.zip  simoniac.zip  faltboat.zip  incurably.zip  payloads.zip  dessiatine.zip  Aside from standard sound security practices (eg: not opening .zip files from untrusted sources), McAfee has published a number of recommendations to mitigate the threat using McAfee products.  The Symantec blog also offers useful information on CTB-Locker for users of Symantec security products.  Should victims be unwilling or unable to pay the ransom, there is virtually no way of recovering the encrypted files. The best way of reducing the impact of a potential crypto ransomware attack is to backup valuable files on a regular basis.

42398149,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShIP,1422290684,UK Bank Closes Safello Accounts 6 Weeks After Entering Partnership,"Six weeks after Swedish-based bitcoin exchange Safello announced rapid 'Faster Payments' deposits for UK customers, its banking partner has withdrawn its services and will close its accounts as of tomorrow.  Safello, which received the 14-day closure notice from the undisclosed UK bank on 13th January, said: ""there was no base for the decision to shut our accounts down. Nor were we unclear in our communication towards the UK bank prior to getting our accounts approved"".  Frank Schuil, Safello's CEO and co-founder, told CoinDesk that the exchange will continue to support international wire transfers for British pounds and that the firm would reactivate Faster Payments once a new bank account had been set up.  Faster Payments deposits were halted on Friday ""to prevent any issues with people's transfers"", he explained.  'Sign of the times'  In a statement, Safello said that it did ""everything in its power to reverse this decision"", adding that its banking partner was fully aware that it was a bitcoin company at the start of the relationship.  When asked about the potential ramifications of the closure, Schuil said:  ""The community has been very understanding that this can happen to any bitcoin business at present time, especially those that are on the forefront of serving new markets.""  Despite the bad news for its UK-based customers, Schuil said the team perceived the decision as ""a sign of the times"".  He continued:  ""We will keep pushing forward trying to cooperate with the banks. This groundbreaking technology takes time to be fully understood and appreciated. Our market entry has given us the experience to ready ourselves quickly and effectively re-enter once that time comes"".  Expansion in the Nordics  The news comes just as Safello also announced that it was entering the Norwegian and Danish markets.  Having spotted a space in the market, Schuil said:  ""Norway has been a bit of a vacuum after Justcoin shut down. In Denmark there are more options, but we felt like our user experience could make a difference there to people who are new to bitcoin.""  Schuil stressed that the company would continue to push forward in order to make local payment methods available to its customers, saying:  ""Sometimes this means a setback where accounts get shut down. Yesterday we announced we lost Faster Payments, today we enter Norway and Denmark.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/26/uk-bank-closes-safello-accounts-6-weeks-after-entering-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3e346d4b8ced4b719794593d2ffe683942b8f1b-2020x688.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398160,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShUD,1422286563,Coinbase's US Bitcoin Exchange Opens Doors to Traders,"Bitcoin services provider Coinbase officially launched its exchange product today to consumers in 24 states.  The news follows what proved a dramatic runup to the launch, one sparked by a single teaser tweet that caused speculation to run rampant Sunday. Speculation was put to rest later in the afternoon, however, when Coinbase confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that its “Lunar project” would be an exchange.  At launch, the Coinbase exchange website proved glitchy, with pages failing to completely load for some users, and others reporting difficulty accessing the service.    @coinbase @BitEuDoPo VERY pretty! (but a bit unstable!) You're gonna need a bigger server!      — Mike Johnson (@mkjohnson1974) January 26, 2015    Coinbase's announcement comes during a rush of news reports that suggest the US bitcoin exchange market is about to be greeted by new high-profile entrants.  Just days ago  , VC investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss announced they would seek to launch an exchange called Gemini as soon as New York's BitLicense regulation is finalized.  Using the exchange  Despite the minor issues experienced at launch, CoinDesk was able to successfully complete an order on the exchange.  Though known for user-friendly products, the Coinbase exchange seems to cater to a more experienced audience. The interface appears without a tutorial or guide that might walk new users through the process.  To begin trading, users must first fund their BTC or USD accounts. They then enter the amount they wish to sell and the price at which they want to make the exchange.  Funds are then visible in the top left of the navigation window. Elsewhere, the exchange boasts an order book and trade history, as well as price chart and depth chart.  CoinDesk was able to fill its order quickly and received funds without issue. Prices on the Coinbase exchange aligned with those observed on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index.  Building trust  For all the excitement, it remains to be seen whether Coinbase’s offering can compete with the more established international exchange market leaders like Bitfinex, Bitstamp and OKCoin, though it will have a head start against other US-based institutions.  The exchange has already garnered the interest of at least one notable bitcoin industry participant, the trading division at illiquid asset exchange SecondMarket, chaired by bitcoin investor Barry Silbert.  At launch, volume was roughly 1,897 BTC. However, at press time, volume on the exchange was trending upward, reaching 3,422 BTC. By comparison, the 30-day average for USD/BTC exchange leader Bitfinex trades 184,862 BTC per day according to Bitcoin Charts.  Coinbase reports it traded 4,628 BTC during its first two hours of operation.  More information on the exchange offering, including content regarding its matching engine, fee model and API can be found on its website.

42398156,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShPI,1422279468,Markets Weekly: Price Crosses $300 Following Coinbase News,"The price of bitcoin has rocketed over the past week, gaining 19% over the seven days to break the $250 mark.  Just before 08:00 (GMT), the price pushed beyond $300, and it was still hovering around that level at press time.  The bitcoin price opened the week at $209.93 and closed seven days later at $254.51, gaining a whopping $40 over that period, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  Buying on the news  Two bullish announcements – both involving the bitcoin services juggernaut Coinbase – coincided with the price spike last week. This doesn't even account for a third notice from Coinbase, that it's opening its own exchange, that came yesterday, as the week closed.  Early in the week, Coinbase revealed that it had sewn up a massive fund-raising round worth $75m, the largest amount of capital raised by a bitcoin company to date. However, the round was significant not only because of the amount of money committed, but because of the investors involved.  The Coinbase round counted institutions and notables who are rooted in the world of mainstream finance, including the Spanish megabank BBVA, the New York Stock Exchange and former Citi chief Vikram Pandit.  The exercise also roped in Japanese telco DoCoMo, which holds out the promise of mass adoption through mobile devices and a broadening of Coinbase's reach, which has been confined to North America and parts of Europe so far.  While the first announcement suggested Coinbase had both the means and the backers to get consumers on board its ""on ramp"" to bitcoin, the second played to a different audience.  Braintree, the payments platform owned by PayPal, announced mid-week that Coinbase was now available on its software development kit. This meant that merchants who use Braintree to enable digital payments could now accept bitcoin payments, but only through Coinbase.  Braintree's merchant base includes some of the hottest names in the Internet economy, with the likes of Uber and Airbnb using its software tools. Now, in theory, Coinbase had access to this merchant base, giving the 2.2 million wallets that its users had generated somewhere to spend their bitcoins.  Both announcements were tightly contained, with nary a rumour finding its way to Reddit. This left bitcoiners to buy on the news, for once, instead of the more common practice of buying on the rumour and selling on the news.  Other good news  A smattering of other bullish news events surfaced in the past week as well. The point-of-sale giant Ingenico added a bitcoin payment option to its terminals, again broadening the merchant base for the cryptocurrency.  And the Winklevoss twins, rumoured to be close to finally launching their bitcoin ETF, unveiled plans for an exchange of their own, promising a ""fully regulated"" platform for trading coins.  The BitMEX trading newsletter suggests that shorts and day-traders may be in for leaner times. It's a market that looks ripe for old-fashioned bitcoin buyers who want to hold their digital currency long term.  ""For long-term holders of bitcoin, I argue that now is a perfect time to jump back in the water,"" newsletter author and BitMEX chief executive Arthur Hayes writes.  Volume issues  A note about volume data. This column uses Bitcoinity as the source of volume data across exchanges. Bitcoinity's aggregation function appears to under-counting volume data in the hours immediately after a given period. Therefore, the weekly volume data period has been shifted back by a day to account for this lag.  I am in touch with Bitcoinity's Kacper Ciesla about this issue and he is looking into it.  Another potential issue readers may wish to note is ANXBTC's volume data. Its 10 currency pairs show nearly identical trading volumes. The same data is shown on both on Bitcoinity and other sources, like Bitcoin Charts. This suggests the exchange is reporting these numbers through its API.  Both these data issues were brought up by Kraken's director of content, Brian Bowman, who wrote in about last week's column, which named Kraken among the top exchanges by volume after pushing out LocalBitcoins.  Bowman told CoinDesk Kraken's data is higher than shown on Bitcoinity because some trading pairs aren't accounted for and Bitcoinity's aggregation feature may not be functioning correctly.  New challengers  Now, on to the volume data itself. After a big week, exchange volumes have fallen sharply. The US dollar exchanges seemed to be hit hardest, with Bitstamp leading the way with a 64% drop in volume, followed by Bitfinex at 56%.  Among Chinese exchanges, BTC China appears to be attracting the punters. It has claimed top spot in three of the last four weeks, beating rivals OKCoin and Huobi. OKCoin is never too far behind, although Huobi appears to have fallen off the pace somewhat.  With the Winklevoss exchange, aptly named Gemini, in the works and the latest news that Coinbase is abandoning its brokerage model in favour of operating a full-blown exchange itself, expect to see serious fluctuations in how trading volume is distributed in the coming months.  US-dollar platforms that don't offer advanced features like leverage or derivatives may find themselves facing the Coinbase machine head-on.      UPDATE (2nd February 2015): ANX has clarified that it operates a ""blended"" order book that shows the total volume done for all currency pairs. As a result of the way Bitcoinity handles ANX data, it has over-stated the total amount of volume done by ANX.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/26/markets-weekly-price-crosses-300-following-coinbase-news,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1dc39593677754d1a9db68f08268b74fee4a1002-1260x840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
