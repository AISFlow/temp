It might sound a bit nonsensical, but it was far from fiction at a bitcoin cash birthday party in London last week, where a circus-meets-gypsy-themed party gathered the cryptocurrency's local enthusiasts in celebration of the one-year anniversary of its first block.  As the party proved, the block was a big one – not just in its 8 MB size, but for the crypto history books, so much so that a year later the memory of its birth remains.  So, too, however, does the controversy around the project, which while still one of the world's largest (securing $10.2 billion in value), continues to have an acrimonious relationship with those backing the blockchain from which it split.  Today, bitcoin cash boasts 32 MB blocks (compared to bitcoin's roughly 1 MB blocks), which according to enthusiasts at the #BitcoinRebirth party in London's West End will make the protocol better for use as an electronic currency.  That's been – rather controversially – the bitcoin cash contingent's main argument for some time, and as the party proved, they have no plan to give up the fight anytime soon.  ""The other branch, it's not bitcoin technology anymore. They don't want bitcoin to be used as currency anymore; they want it to be used as digital gold,"" Ayre told CoinDesk.  He continued:  ""I wish them good luck with it. It's just unfortunate they stole the bitcoin name when they did it.""  Unveiled via a retro ""Streetfighter"" video during the event, the new bitcoin cash logo attempts to hammer home the message that the bitcoin name should be reclaimed, with a fighter using a samurai sword to cut the ""cash"" part of the project's logo to reveal tagline that concludes: ""... because bitcoin cash is bitcoin.""  The drivers  But that was far from the only strange occurrence of the evening. While the percussion of a traditional Chinese orchestra played in the background, Ayre explained why he believes that bitcoin cash has already been a success.  According to him, a lot of bitcoin projects were canned once it became clear that microtransactions were no longer tenable using that blockchain. But now, those projects are popping back up, on bitcoin cash.  ""Thankfully, it was only gone for a short period but that short period has probably held back the evolution of bitcoin as a currency and as a payment platform, and as a platform for other types of applications to run on top of it,"" he said.  Asked specifically about how bitcoin cash will entice merchants to adopt bitcoin cash, Ayre said there is a merchant program afoot with direct sales people educating large merchants.  However, he added, developed world merchant adoption is not the main driver. Instead, Ayre sees adoption growing in the developing world first.  ""I think that will be people using bitcoin to solve problems for the unbanked with microtransactions, new applications,"" Ayre told CoinDesk. ""In the developed world it's going to happen through applications being built on top of the bitcoin cash platform.""  He continued:  ""That is going to allow unique business models that couldn't exist before and could not exist on other platforms because they don't scale.""  The guests  Elsewhere, attendees were unsurprisingly keen on the cryptocurrency. Elizabeth White, who founded the White Company, a crypto concierge service, was on hand to explain why she supports the technology.  Her company, which has handled more than $100 million in cryptocurrency sales of luxury items in the last year, started off accepting bitcoin, litecoin and ether, added stellar and then most recently added bitcoin cash. Because of that, White has begun to notice trends between each coins' users.  For example, bitcoin cash seems to be emerging as a popular choice with a lot of ""fun"" users, White told CoinDesk.  ""While the ethereum people are more likely to be being paying their mom's rent,"" she said. Bitcoin cash ""is used for things like Beyonce and Jay-Z World Tour tickets, or people throwing parties on Greek Islands and buying Dom Perignon,"" she explained.  Still, the newly crypto rich and famous weren't the only ones in attendance.  Others at the event included developers and miners, but also some curious newbies, including members of a student lifestyle platform based in Manchester and the entrepreneurs behind a ticketing portal looking to accept cryptocurrency in the near future.  As such, it seems bitcoin cash is slowly, but surely attracting a new wave of potential cryptocurrency enthusiasts, ones that just might bring about another merchant rush like the one seen with bitcoin in 2014.

A tool that visualizes a real-time list of outstanding orders for a particular asset, order books represent the interests of buyers and sellers, offering a window into supply and demand.  But while all order books serve the same purpose, their appearance can differ slightly among exchanges. That said, they are all built with the same features and functions.  Examples from Coinbase Pro, Binance, Bitfinex and Kraken are shown below:  To become comfortable reading order books, it is essential to understand four main concepts: bid, ask, amount and price. This information is displayed on two sides of the order book known as the buy-side and sell-side.  For the purposes of this explanation, we will be using the BTC/USD order book from one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitfinex.  Price and Amount  Although the two sides display opposing information, the concepts of amount (also referred to as size) and price are relevant to both. Simply put, the amount and price per order display the total units of the cryptocurrency looking to be traded and at what price each unit is valued.  In the example below there is an open buy order in the amount of 20.24 at a price of $8218.50.  This means the entity who opened this order would like to purchase 20.24 units of bitcoin at a price of $8,218.50 per unit.  In the Bitfinex order book, you will also see the terms ""count"" and ""total.""  The count refers to how many orders are combined at this price level to create the amount, whereas the total is simply a running total of the combined amounts.  The Buy Side  The buy side represents all open buy orders below the last traded price.  This offer from the buyer is known as the ""bid."" It effectively voices the trader's interest, stating something like, ""I am bidding on X units you own at a specific price in the hopes of purchasing them.""  Once the bid is matched with an appropriate sell order, the trade can be facilitated.  When there is an abundance of buy orders (demand) at a specific price level, something known as a buy wall is formed.  Buy walls have an effect on the price of an asset because if the large order cannot be filled, neither can buy orders at a lower bid. The price will not be able to sink any further since the orders below the wall cannot be executed until the large order is fulfilled – in turn helping the wall act as a short-term support level.  In the example above, we can see a large order of 500.2 BTC units waiting to be filled with a bid of $6,263.  Since the order is rather large (high demand) compared to what is being offered (low supply), the orders at a lower bid cannot be filled until this order is satisfied – creating a buy wall.  In this case, the buy wall is helping the $6,263 price level of bitcoin act as short-term support.  The Sell Side  Conversely, the sell side contains all open sell orders above the last traded price.  This price is known as the ""ask."" It states, ""I am asking someone to buy X units I own at a certain price.""  The opposite of a buy wall is formed when there is an abundance of sell orders (supply) at a specific price level, known as a sell wall. If there is a very large sell order unlikely to be filled due to lack of demand at the specified price level, then sell orders at a higher price cannot be executed - therefore making the price level of the wall a short-term resistance.  Conclusion  All in all, the order book gives a trader an opportunity to make more informed decisions based on the buy and sell interest of a particular cryptocurrency.  Essentially, it provides a ""behind the scenes"" view into live-action supply and demand which may reveal order imbalances, market manipulation and support/resistance zones – all of which can be used to a savvy trader's advantage.
