A couple of countries so far have approved some crypto ETFs and investors can trade on these. However, the United States is yet to see the approval of its very first bitcoin ETF. Speculations around the approval of a bitcoin ETF have been on the rise lately. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was expected to make a ruling on various Bitcoin ETFs that had been filed. But the regulator had moved up the date. In the case of VanEck, moving it by 60 days until the SEC would provide its decision on the Bitcoin ETF. SEC Boss Clarifies Stance On Crypto After SEC Chairman Gary Gensler announced that the regulatory body had no intention of banning bitcoin in the United States, investors began to expect the approval of a bitcoin ETF soon.

In August, the company said it would start offering the crypto payment option via a pilot program to gauge demand for this service. It was the first mortgage lender to do so.  “As we said last quarter, we were going to look into accepting cryptocurrency and test it to see if it’s a faster, easier and cheaper solution,” the company’s CEO, Mat Ishbia, said in a press release. “Due to the current combination of incremental costs and regulatory uncertainty in the crypto space, we’ve concluded we aren’t going to extend beyond a pilot at this time.”  The Pontiac, Mich.-based company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in January after a merger with Gores Holdings IV, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) at a $16.1 billion valuation for the combined entity.  United Wholesale Mortgage tried bitcoin, ether and dogecoin and worked with a number of different borrowers to evaluate the crypto lending process, according to CNBC.

42424492,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2p71h,1634249231,Coinbase Proposes US Create New Regulator to Oversee Crypto,"Crypto exchange Coinbase wants the U.S. government to create a new regulator to oversee the cryptocurrency industry.  Unveiled Thursday, Coinbase’s Digital Asset Policy Proposal suggests Congress pass legislation to regulate Marketplaces for Digital Assets (MDAs) – its term for crypto exchanges that offer custody and trading services, as well as borrowing and lending services – and create a registration process for those entities. The exchange also proposed that the crypto industry establish a self-regulatory organization for crypto businesses.  CoinDesk first reported that Coinbase was developing this proposal last month.  Coinbase’s proposal suggests four “regulatory pillars” to guide the process: regulating digital assets under an industry-specific framework, creating the new regulator, establishing fraud protections and disclosure requirements for crypto businesses and promoting interoperability.  Under the proposal, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) wouldn’t qualify as MDAs, and the regulator would have the authority to approve any cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin and ether for listing or trading in the U.S.  The proposal represents an escalation of Coinbase’s public fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Earlier this month, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler told members of the House Financial Services Committee that the SEC had all the authorities necessary to regulate crypto, saying, “We don’t need another regulator.”  Despite Gensler’s assurances, the perception of crypto regulation in the U.S. has been that it is disjointed, with no single federal regulator assigned to the overall industry. The SEC oversees securities and has spent years filing enforcement actions against initial coin offering tokens and crypto startups accused of violating federal securities laws, while its counterpart, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), oversees crypto futures markets and certain illicit activities like market manipulation.  However, there is no spot market regulator at the federal level.  Rather than relying on what the paper describes as “laws drafted in the 1930s,” which “could not comprehend this technological revolution,” Coinbase wants Congress to enact fresh laws.  “This is the kind of issue that requires legislative action,” Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s chief policy officer, said during a media preview call Thursday. “Our focus is very much on a legislative effort, which, from our sense of things, is inevitable.”  Shirzad told CoinDesk that Coinbase has had more than 30 meetings with congressional offices, as well as numerous meetings “at agencies and in the administration.”  Shirzad said that Congress has shown an interest in Coinbase’s proposal, but stressed that a timeline for potential legislation remained unclear.  “I think the feedback on the Hill has been welcoming, very welcoming,” Shirzad said. “Not because anybody stood up and said, ‘Okay, your pillars will become law in a week and a half.’”  When asked what the SEC thought of the proposal, Shirzad said that Coinbase has reached out to the SEC and that the regulator has “expressed an interest in hearing from [Coinbase].”  Aside from taking the proposal to meetings with legislators and regulators, Shirzad also said that the Digital Asset Policy Proposal will be published on GitHub today in order to give the broader crypto community a chance to read the proposal and provide feedback.  In a statement supporting the proposal, Michael Piwowar – a former acting chairman of the SEC who is now executive director of the Milken Institute Center for Financial Markets – said, “I commend Coinbase for developing their thoughtful framework for regulating digital assets. Regulatory certainty in the United States is urgently needed to maintain our leadership in responsible financial innovation.”  UPDATE (Oct. 14, 2021, 17:56 UTC): Updates with additional details.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,"Nikhilesh De, Cheyenne Ligon",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/14/coinbase-proposes-us-create-new-regulator-to-oversee-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35c8f7b6f904b0545db9db961bd1b7fe5f635ac4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As of Thursday morning, the waiting list was at 1.35 million, which is four times the 300,0000 users that OpenSea, the world’s largest NFT marketplace, has, according to a note from financial services firm BTIG.  “We believe the immediate and emphatic reaction of retail customers to its announcement on Tuesday that it would launch a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace by the end of the year has demonstrated its ability to accelerate the transformation of its franchise,” BTIG analyst Mark Palmer, who has a buy rating and $500 price target on Coinbase, wrote.  Coinbase’s planned NFT marketplace comes as rival exchange FTX on Tuesday announced it was moving into the NFT business with a trading platform for digital collectibles on the Solana blockchain. Trading in NFTs climbed to $10.7 billion in the third quarter, an increase of more than 700% from the previous quarter, according to a report by blockchain analytics firm DappRadar.  BTIG estimates that Coinbase could add $137.5 million in revenue, or about 2% of BTIG’s full-year 2021 revenue estimate for the company through the new NFT marketplace.

42424493,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2p7Fh,1634248251,Market Wrap: Ether Outperforms Bitcoin as Traders Look to Altcoins,"Cryptocurrencies were mostly higher on Thursday as some traders appear to be rotating into tokens that have underperformed over the past month. Bitcoin was roughly flat over the past 24 hours, compared with a 7% jump for ether over the same period.  “Direction-wise for BTC, we find ourselves with a bullish bias but unable to form a strong bullish conviction in spite of the clear optimism in the market,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in an announcement on Telegram.  Despite BTC’s recent outperformance, QCP mentioned that it is “extremely excited” about the new growth phase in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. The firm maintains long positions in tokens such as Algorand’s ALGO and Solana’s SOL relative to its neutral BTC position.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $57,730, +1.2%  Ether (ETH), $3,788, +7.7%  S&P 500: +1.7%  Gold: $1,799, +0.3%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.518%  Ether underperformance narrows  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is holding price support above $3,500, and its underperformance versus BTC over the past month appears to be narrowing as some investors look toward improving fundamentals in alternative cryptocurrencies.  FundStrat, a global advisory firm reiterated its bullish stance on ether in a newsletter published on Wednesday. “We remain comfortable in the perceived tailwinds that the leading smart contract platform is set to benefit from and expect rotations into ETH to follow any sizable run-up in a bitcoin-dominated market,” the firm wrote.  From a technical perspective, the chart below shows the ETH/BTC ratio rising from the 200-day moving average for the first time since April, which preceded a period of strong outperformance. The ratio broke above a short-term downtrend in August and could see further upside toward 0.07 over the short term.  Still, some analysts expect bitcoin’s outperformance to continue given expectations for a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETF) in the coming weeks.  “BTC open interest (the total number of outstanding futures contracts) is still 30% away from May highs, suggesting that markets have yet to reach a state of euphoria,” Delphi Digital wrote in a blog post. “As BTC’s ETF narrative strengthens, it’s likely that ETH and the alt L1 narrative (layer 1 altcoins) will take a back seat at least for the near future.”  Bitcoin exchange outflows moderate  Crypto exchanges are seeing modest outflows of bitcoin. Typically, outflows mean traders are deciding to store their BTC in wallets, anticipating higher prices instead of holding BTC on an exchange to buy or sell.  “May-July was the primary period of net inflows [to exchanges], however this has been fully reversed,” Glassnode, a crypto data firm, tweeted on Thursday.  Over the past few months, however, exchange outflows have plateaued, as seen in the chart below. That suggests traders are gradually moving BTC back onto exchanges for trading purposes as bitcoin’s price rallies. Over time, a shift to exchange inflows could signal a peak in BTC’s price, similar to what happened in May.

42410984,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtuEH,1634247643,Why Shiba Inu Has Been More Resilient Than Some SHIB Haters Would Like to Admit,"The world knows a thing or two about SHIBArmy, the community behind the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer shiba inu coin (SHIB). But does it know how powerful SHIBArmy can be?  SHIB, the token that’s clearly not taken seriously by most institutional investors, is still far from dead after another dumping event last week. Blockchain data reveals a tale of how small, individual investors can go against big institutions when they are united.  Since Monday, the SHIB community has been celebrating the survival of last Thursday’s bloody dump across social media platforms: “Shiba Inu rebounds 40% despite major selling by SHIB whales,” a Shiba Inu Telegram group posted on Tuesday under the title “Whales are NOT in control of Shiba.” The message has since been circulating in many Telegram groups.  “We are Shiba The Doge Killer,” the message ended.  Read more: Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB): A Beginner’s Guide 2021  SHIB by the numbers  The whale dump mentioned in the message, according to blockchain data firm Santiment, took place on Thursday.  That’s when about 31.07 billion SHIB were shed from addresses that held 1 million to 10 million SHIB, wiping out 3.02% of all addresses with SHIB holding within the range. (For clarity’s sake, 1 million to 10 million SHIB is worth $27 to $272 at current prices.)  Santiment also captured a significant uptick in both active deposits and exchange inflow of SHIB at the time.  To be fair, with SHIB’s price still far below $1, the aforementioned message from Tuesday decrying the influence of SHIB whales isn’t fully supported. The top 10 SHIB addresses hold more than 78% of the total SHIB supply and barely moved any SHIB during the time period in question, according to Santiment data.  But nevertheless, the impact of such collective dumping among small SHIB traders is obvious: Last Thursday, the biggest dump so far, SHIB’s price dropped by more than $17% on the day, according to data from TradingView and Binance.  At press time, SHIB was changing hands at $0.00002727, up 34.4% from its latest dump.  Pros weigh in  Professional traders who spoke to CoinDesk are not sure why the meme coin is showing such resiliency.  A comparison of SHIB to its predecessor, DOGE, is even more stunning: SHIB’s merely 23% down from its peak in May, according to CoinGecko. DOGE, perhaps the most well-known and popular of the dog coins, is down by more than 68% from its top in May.  “SHIB is like this ‘retail-traders-take-over-the-world’ magic token” that has gained a strong base, an active SHIB community member who goes by the name “Darren” told CoinDesk via WeChat. He added that many of the SHIB holders do not track bitcoin’s ups and downs, so it’s hard to pin SHIB’s moves on that of other cryptocurrencies.  The coin’s strong retail user base is also reflected on social media platforms, according to Du Jun, co-founder of crypto exchange Huobi, who pointed out that SHIB’s official Twitter account has more than 1.1 million followers, a higher number than most of other crypto projects.  “Shiba inu has a strong user base and its projects are relatively simple and easy to understand for crypto beginners,” Du said.  During the past summer when SHIB’s performance was more lackluster, unique addresses for SHIB also managed to continue to grow, per data from Nansen. There are over 750,000 unique addresses holding SHIB as of Oct. 11, more than doubled from May 10 when its price hit an all-time high.  “Price slides haven’t deterred new entrants who think SHIB can go much higher since it is relatively very cheap, especially when compared to DOGE, which it emulates and aims to surpass,” Hunain Naseer, senior editor at OKExInsights, said.  Many a dump  Santiment told CoinDesk Thursday’s dumping event was not the first time when many addresses holding 1 million to 10 million SHIB chose to take some risk off the table.  Each sell-off resulted in an immediate price dip – followed by a quick rebound.  Collective dumping behavior by small traders – not long after some pro-SHIB posts on social media – is one of the more plausible explanations for the trading behavior, according to Santiment.  “With memecoins [that have] many small traders, like DOGE and SHIB, there can be many pump and dump groups where collective small traders cause an impact in the price direction they’re hoping to achieve for the short-term,” Santiment’s Brian Quinlivan said.  Quinlivan also noted that SHIB holders in the 1 million to 10 million range are the only group trading a significant amount of SHIB, addresses holding more than 10 million SHIB, which own 99.9% of SHIB supply still, have barely moved their SHIB holdings.  The real SHIB whales  Notably, one address accumulated more than 8 trillion SHIB (about $234.3 million) on Thursday. The address has not moved out any of its SHIB holdings.  Despite the potential new threats of SHIB whale activity, the SHIB community has moved on and seems only getting stronger.  As of Wednesday, SHIB is still among the top 10 most traded tokens on centralized exchanges, according to CoinGecko, an impressive number when the majority (68%) of SHIB trades are still taking place on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, based on Nansen’s data.  Santiment pointed out that the amount of daily addresses interacting with SHIB is “crazy high,” especially compared with many other more established tokens on Ethereum.  Data from Nansen and another blockchain data firm, Crystal, indicates the SHIB is actively traded on decentralized exchange Uniswap – around half of the coin’s total supply has moved to Uniswap.  Huobi’s Du added that ShibaSwap, the decentralized exchange powered by SHIB, has built a number of functions including swapping, staking, farming and even non-fungible tokens (NFTs), meaning that the project has grown out of a “meme coin” to a “sophisticated” DeFi project.  SHIB community member Darren also explained that many crypto newbies have remained active in the SHIB project because they were grateful for the wealth they’ve achieved through SHIB.  “The markets remember the time when a lot of new retail traders made money through SHIB earlier this year,” he said.  SHIBA “is already considered a mainstream coin, and unlikely to go away anytime soon,” Du said.

While $2.3 trillion is small compared to the $250 trillion global financial system, it doesn’t take much to destabilize things. The sub-prime debt market was valued at around $1.2 trillion in 2008, just before the financial crisis, noted the BoE’s Jon Cunliffe, the bank’s deputy governor of financial stability in a speech.  ”In that case, the knock-on effects of a price collapse in a relatively small market was amplified and reverberated through an un-resilient financial system causing huge and persistent economic damage,” Cunliffe said.  Cunliffe said that because the crypto industry is growing rapidly and beginning to connect to the traditional financial system, with the emergence of leveraged players and in a mostly unregulated space, systemic risks, while limited now, could grow very quickly.  He said that regulation should be “pursued as a matter of urgency” and quoted SEC chair Gary Gensler’s recent comment that “financial innovations throughout history do not flourish outside public policy frameworks.”",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nelson Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/13/bank-of-england-says-crypto-has-grown-to-twice-the-size-of-subprime-debt-in-2008,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a6d9f27ef3c6a7b4355989984d11b010555c731-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421031,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBHbh,1634246571,Meet the DeFi Delegate Knocking on the Doors of Congress,"It might well be history: On July 28, 2021, Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) headlined a Q&A session with the MakerDAO community – perhaps the first-ever meeting between a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and a sitting U.S. congressman.  The sit-down was cordial and surprisingly lighthearted, given that just a day before Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) now-famously decried crypto’s “shadowy super coders.” (Budd himself is actually a fan of the branding: “Kind of cool, right?”)  At the end of the MakerDAO event, Budd even issued a mandate for Maker fans to spread the good word about decentralized finance (DeFi) throughout the halls of Congress: He called on the DAO to “build on islands of health and strength” and to “go where your message is heard.”  At least one MakerDAO delegate – a term for a community member who wields not just their own token power but has been chosen to represent the stake of other community members as well – has heeded the call. The same one who organized the Budd Q&A, in fact.  PaperImperium, a pseudonymous member of the DAO and its most powerful delegate representing over 3% of the project’s voting power, for months now has been quietly building a network of bankers, politicians and policymakers – a group he is helping to educate on DeFi in a lone effort to encourage more hospitable regulations for Maker.  The efforts come as bigger players such as venture capital behemoth Andreessen Horowitz and publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase seek to guide looming regulatory action in the DeFi space, a $216 billion sector that has heretofore flown under the radar.  But for all the corporate outreach efforts, a single DeFi native may be mounting a more effective campaign by simply picking up the phone.  Social and political integration  In an interview with CoinDesk, PaperImperium claims that his ever-expanding Rolodex includes members of the House and the Senate; academics at MIT, Wharton and the University of Chicago’s Booth business school; and senior staff of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).  Indeed, House and Fed officials have appeared at his events; CoinDesk verified one Senate connection and reviewed email exchanges with officials from the Bank of Canada and the BIS.  PaperImperium’s is a one-man crusade born out of a vision to see Maker become a regulated, taxpaying financial entity – what he believes to be a necessary step in the protocol’s expansion into real-world services.  “For Maker, my agenda is one of further economic and social and political integration with the real world. This is all part and parcel of the same thing: We’re building gas stations and solar farms and houses, and you can’t integrate economically and not integrate socially and politically,” he said in an interview with CoinDesk, referring to building projects from 6s Capital linked to Maker loans.  Read more: Société Générale Applies for $20M MakerDAO Loan Using Bond Token Collateral  His work is timely to the extent that crypto increasingly has real-world influence.  A recent report shows that Ethereum alone settled $6.2 trillion in transactions over the past 12 months – compared with PayPal’s $936 billion 2020 total. Meanwhile, the aggregate cryptocurrency market capitalization is well in excess of $2 trillion, larger than the market capitalizations of Google and Amazon and now threatening to overtake Microsoft at $2.2 trillion.  Crypto, it seems, can no longer be safely ignored – and yet it’s nigh impossible to find a policymaker, banker or finance expert who can intelligently discuss, for instance, the difference between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.  ‘They’ve failed this industry’  Just last month, mainstream political and financial pundits were left flabbergasted when crypto advocates all but single-handedly stalled a Senate vote on a historic infrastructure deal, reflecting a widespread ignorance that rightfully frustrated insiders. Nearly a decade and a half after the publication of the Bitcoin white paper, crypto isn’t so much an elephant in the room as a rampaging herd trampling onlookers’ houses.  PaperImperium, however, places much of the blame for this information asymmetry on the crypto community itself. If the problem is a lack of representation and education, then where are lobbyists and educators?  “It’s an illustration of how far behind we are that I’m often the first person from the crypto industry that has reached out to many of these people,” he said. “It’s damning evidence that those who have been in charge of advocating for us have failed themselves and they’ve failed this industry.”  He may have a point.  Efforts to cobble together DeFi-native lobbyist organizations have seen mixed results. One instance, the Uniswap DAO-supported DeFi Education Fund, appears to be mirroring Washington itself with a lavish budget ($20 million over four to five years), unclear goals and a host of unsatisfied constituents.  Read more: DeFi Gets Proactive About Policy Thanks to a $20M Grant From the Uniswap Community  On the other hand, “LexpunK,” another effort, is a “Builder Defense DAO” with the stated intent of waging “guerilla lawfare” against the enemies of DeFi. Proposed sorties include position papers, “legal defense against regulatory litigation” and “amicus curiae,” a Latin phrase meaning “friend of the court,” briefs in response to overeager charges from Gary Gensler’s Securities and Exchange Commission. The group raised $3 million from the Curve, Yearn and Lido DAOs earlier this year.  While many of these advocates are pushing for specialized regulation for DeFi, PaperImperium’s outreach strategy stands out for being focused on finding ways for Maker to function within existing legal systems.  “If we’re going to comply with any laws and regulations, then it’s clear that we should in any jurisdiction where we do business,” he told CoinDesk.  As promising as this vision may be, some members of the Maker community believe it may also be fundamentally at odds with the open, permissionless nature of DeFi. This had led to an ongoing battle currently playing out in Maker’s governance forums – one that could spill over to the rest of the ecosystem, ultimately defining DeFi’s legal framework as the young vertical moves from the billions and into the trillions.  Second-order expertise  Anywhere except in DeFi, it would be a surprise that PaperImperium meets regularly with some of the most powerful people in the world.  In his normal life, he’s an archeological consultant, specializing in helping governmental bodies and companies check for “cultural resources” and ensure that construction projects comply with the National Historic Preservation Act.  A father of three, he’s prone to bellyaching about his limited time – remarkably, his educational efforts are conducted intermittently in stolen hours between his other responsibilities.  However, DAOs reward doers, not resumes. As a MakerDAO delegate, he wears a variety of hats by virtue of having stepped up and seized them: lobbyist, educator, economist.  “Crypto, you have to understand, it’s a thinly-settled frontier,” he told CoinDesk. “You don’t always have the expertise at hand that you want, so sometimes you have to take second-tier and third-tier experts, and that means I kind of landed an ‘unofficial economist’ role, at least with regards to monetary policy in crypto.”  Based on his conversations, however, he doesn’t need to be the world’s foremost expert on DeFi or stablecoins to help bankers and regulators grasp the fundamentals.  “Let me stress that we’re starting at a very, very low bar. Even our friends do not have what people in crypto would consider very basic understanding. Even people who like us, we have to show them, ‘No, we don’t mine DAI, it’s generated by the user with overcollateralized loans. No, Maker is not its own blockchain,’” he said.  DeFi in D.C.  He noted that academics tend to be “further along,” but said central bankers and politicians can rarely name cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin and tether, the largest stablecoin and a frequent target for regulators. The conversations are “starting from zero.”  Capable of rattling off the names of politicians on various committees and discussing upcoming elections with granular detail, he’s strategic in whom he reaches out to. When it comes to prominent academics and researchers who are currently involved in actively designing CBDCs, PaperImperium has even helped them access research and on-chain data that would otherwise be difficult to track down – after all, “these are the people advising policymakers.”  “These are the people wondering, ‘Does DAI have to passively accept monetary policy from the Fed?’ It does. These are the people who want to know how it works, and then they give a kind of high-level view to voting members of important committees,” he said.  Ultimately he strives to be a diplomat.  “Let me be clear: DeFi has no good friends and no leverage, and we need both. And how do we get that? Not by drunk-tweeting puerile messages, we do it by reaching out and engaging with people – we have to sit across the table from people.”  Sweeping vision  PaperImperium’s work is currently uncompensated.  MakerDAO is internally debating a proposal to pay delegates for their time, and likewise a proposal was recently voted down for the DAO to grant him $50,000 in DAI for his extra legwork on the lobbying side. Since its failure, he has hinted he could be taking his services elsewhere.  It’s an illustrative example of some of the challenges DAOs may face when hiring for a role like his: Public organizations need tangible results to justify salaries, but the unofficial lobbying work he conducts often requires discretion and quiet personal connections.  “I don’t do anything at Maker,” he joked about his position. “I just mash the ‘vote’ button.”  Paid or not, his efforts are growing more important.  Maker currently owns “small exposure” to pools from the Centrifuge protocol, a DeFi platform that offers real-world loans. Additionally, the protocol recently onboarded 6s Capital, a U.S. firm that builds Wawa gas stations and hardware stores, among other commercial real estate.  Those real-world efforts are also growing more ambitious.  “We’ve already taken our first and probably hardest vote to approve a $21 million loan to build a solar farm on East Long Island,” he told CoinDesk.  He hopes that this increasing meatspace footprint will help him “get in front of” more lawmakers, and a crypto-financed solar farm could be a powerful messaging tool.  “It’s a firm rebuke to the idea that crypto is nothing but a casino, because it’s now providing jobs and green energy,” PaperImperium said. “It’s a Republican district – the congressman sits on the house financial services committee – in a heavily Democratic state which is financially important, and the two Democratic senators are quite important themselves, so it’s geographically well-placed. Once we close on it, it will be proof of the evolving and maturing state of crypto.”  These messaging victories are important because the goal is simply not to be seen as “shadowy super coders;” if DeFi can become socially acceptable, the path towards regulation might grow easier.  “If you’re sitting in Congress, you have a messy withdrawal in Afghanistan, this infrastructure package, tax policy, what’s going on with the latest natural disaster – listen, we are not high on their list. You can’t expect them to be experts on us,” he said.  Crypto education  Much of his work is also devoted to helping policymakers differentiate between projects rather than painting with a broad brush. While he works as an advocate for all of DeFi, he made it clear to CoinDesk that he’s invested in Maker and considers himself an agent working primarily for the DAO, and he does not believe all projects – especially all stablecoin projects – are created equal.  “A lot of these stablecoins look like shadow banks because they are shadow banks,” he said. “These people wouldn’t be doing their jobs if they didn’t say, ‘Well, this looks like a deposit-taking institution.’”  By contrast, Maker, he argues, is software-as-a-service (SaaS) with no custody. Just like how from the outside a bank and a credit union may look the same, the process for arriving at Maker’s DAI and Tether’s USDT are significantly different.  Ultimately, he’s pushing for Maker to become regulatory-compliant across all jurisdictions.  “I don’t want Maker to be out there as a cowboy. Maker, at least for crypto, has a historically conservative culture. I don’t want us out there flaunting laws and getting served subpoenas at conferences,” he said.  That exact vision, however, is putting PaperImperium at odds with other members of the Maker community.  Community tension  In recent weeks he has voiced support for topics that might make DeFi die-hards uncomfortable, including using Maker treasury funds to ensure all employees and delegates obtain legal protections, and identifying a friendly jurisdiction in which the DAO might register as a taxpaying financial entity.  He repeatedly expressed frustration with what he perceived to be a lack of practical steps both the DeFi community and Maker have failed to take, noting that it’s leading to a genuine existential risk.  “People underestimate the fragile position we’re in,” he said. “I’m out there trying to get external eyes on Maker to show that we’re a responsible actor. That comes in the form of prestigious finance professors performing Fed-style stress-tests on us, and I’m talking to ratings agencies and the like.”  He added: “We have to find ways to convince our critics that we’re not going to wreck everybody else.”  Not everyone agrees with this approach, however.  “This simply isn’t possible. There’s no way to force someone to join such a group, and there is also no way for such a group to control Maker Governance,” wrote MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen of a registered Maker entity in the governance forums.  This leaves the DAO at a genuine crossroads: attempt to integrate with existing financial regulation, which some believe to be impossible, or continue to operate in a legal gray area, which others believe to be untenable.  MakerDAO isn’t the only group debating these choices, either. Across the DeFi ecosystem teams are toying with “CeDeFi” – finding ways for mainstream financial entities to interact with DeFi protocols in a regulatory-compliant manner.  In particular, Aave Arc, a framework allowing institutions to deploy permissioned instances of Aave, has sparked significant debate about what steps should be taken to enable oversight.  In the end, however, PaperImperium’s vision may be the one that wins simply because he’s the one doing the legwork to make it a reality. Which is strange, given how easy he makes it seem.  “Words are cheap – often free,” he said. “We should use them as much as we can.”",POSITIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MKR | REGULATION | DAI,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/14/meet-the-defi-delegate-knocking-on-the-doors-of-congress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1780a8fb95c5ce82890ecff8daddb77bea5ac2d6-7046x4699.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency is currently trading marginally lower on the day near $57,300, having earlier touched a five-month high of $58,500. It is up 30% this month, though, buoyed by increased expectations that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will soon approve a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The Fed minutes carried fewer references to inflation being transitory and showed policymakers are worried that price pressures might remain high for longer than previously assumed.  The shift from the long-held narrative that high inflation will be short-lived suggests the central bank may opt for a faster policy tightening than is already priced in. Several policymakers said they preferred to proceed more rapidly.  Faster tightening would be negative for bitcoin and liquidity-addicted asset markets in general. Markets have anticipated a monthly tapering of $15 billion starting in November or December. The central bank has been buying $80 billion of Treasurys and $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities every month since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.  Still, sentiment among some market participants remains bullish, with analysts calling for continued “HODLing” – crypto slang for buy and hold – at least till the first ETF is approved. The SEC is likely to approve at least four ETFs this month, according to Bloomberg.  Bitcoin, however, has already rallied more than 30% on ETF speculation. Further, a futures-based ETF has a downside and may not be as bullish as widely expected. So the Fed’s hawkish tilt may hurt bitcoin, especially if equity markets drop.  Bitcoin’s options market shows demand for downside protection in the form of put options. “Front-end risk reversals [short duration] remain skewed to the downside (i.e. puts are more expensive than calls) and the put skew has actually deepened with spot moving higher,” QCP Capital said in its Telegram channel. “A reflection of prevailing downside nervousness in the market.”  The one-week put-call skew has climbed to 7%, while the one-month gauge has crossed above zero.

The Ministry of Energy is working on solutions, he said, though it’s unclear if any particular bills or directives will be implemented soon.  The remark comes soon after the head of Irkutsk, a region in Siberia popular with crypto miners, complained miners are running their operations in residential buildings and consuming large amounts of power at retail prices.  Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev wrote to vice prime minister Alexander Novak earlier this week, saying electricity consumption in the region has grown by 159% since last year. He blamed illegal mining and the influx of miners from China following that country’s regulatory crackdown on crypto.  Roman Zabuga, a spokesman for BitRiver, a major mining farm in the region, said crypto mining has flourished, alongside the growing bitcoin price. He said that growth is coming from locals expanding existing mining operations or starting new ones.  “These miners are, in fact, using electricity for households, on the price that is subsidized by the regional government, for business purposes,” he said, adding that special tariffs for miners might be introduced in the future.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/14/russian-energy-minister-says-miners-should-pay-more-for-electricity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acd5d6c9ad1958f05126537cc9de7e3d77c7ee42-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Morgan Stanley confirmed in April that it’s offering wealth management clients exposure to bitcoin by way of a pair of external crypto funds.  “For us, honestly it’s just not a huge part of the business demand for our clients,” Gorman added. “That may evolve and will evolve with it, but certainly it’s not what’s driving our economics one way or the other.”  Gorman’s comments come after JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this week called bitcoin “worthless.” In the past, Dimon has called bitcoin a “fraud” and “fool’s gold.”  Read more: Morgan Stanley Taps Longtime Foreign-Exchange Expert to Lead Crypto Research Team: Report",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | RESEARCH,Josh Fineman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/14/morgan-stanley-ceo-says-crypto-isnt-a-fad-though-not-seeing-much-client-demand,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf8478c10da8a043256b5af23255f59ccf0f29c7-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The filing, revealed by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan on Thursday, would trade based on the price of actual bitcoin, rather than bitcoin futures, and is based on the Securities Exchange Commission’s 2019 rejection of a previous application.  At the time, the SEC cited market manipulation and surveillance concerns, including what agency officials saw as the lack of a market of “significant” size.  Bitwise now believes that these concerns can be addressed, Hougan said in a Twitter thread.  Referring to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Hougan tweeted that “The CME is now the leading source of price discovery in the bitcoin market! That’s compared to Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, Huobi, BitMEX and even FTX. Prices statistically move first on the CME. The market has matured.”  The filing, which weighs in at over 250 pages, includes multiple charts comparing CME’s price discovery rate compared to other exchanges, dating back to December 2017, when the market first launched its bitcoin futures product.  It remains unclear whether the SEC will indeed approve a bitcoin or bitcoin futures ETF at this time. The agency has to date rejected every crypto exchange-traded product application it has received.  However, the agency seems poised to approve the first bitcoin futures ETFs. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said he looks “forward to the staff’s review of such filings, particularly if those are limited to these CME-traded bitcoin futures” in a speech in August, prompting a number of fresh filings for such products.

Decentraland is hosting a first-of-its-kind music festival featuring more than 80 real-world artists. Big names such as Paris Hilton, Deadmau5, Alabaster dePlume and 3LAU are involved.  The four-day “Metaverse Festival” also includes VIP areas, a merchandise store for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and, oddly, portable toilets. The festival starts Oct. 21.  “It is a celebration of music and culture in the virtual social world, but also a recognition that the metaverse has arrived as a viable, irresistible and profitable space for creative people, whatever their medium or background,” Decentraland community and events lead Sam Hamilton said in a statement.  Among the artists performing is Scottish singer and songwriter Nina Nesbitt, who is new to the metaverse but found the opportunity appealing because in-person concerts are only slowly coming back to life, she told CoinDesk in an interview.  “I’m not able to tour internationally at the moment, and it made me think of other ways I can perform and connect with my fan base,” Nesbitt said. “I thought this was a really interesting way and something that’s quite new and has not been done that much before in the pop world so I wanted to give it a try.”  The metaverse has become increasingly popular as people have been looking to the digital space during the pandemic to connect with friends and family or seek entertainment. Many of the metaverses today are blockchain-based, like Decentraland.  “I think if it hadn’t been the pandemic, maybe I wouldn’t have gone down this route,” Nesbitt said.  Decentraland is a virtual reality platform that’s built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create, experience and monetize content and applications.  For the festival, the musical acts pre-record their gigs, which will then be turned into a digital performance by an avatar. Nesbitt recorded her set in her studio room.  “It was really strange recording it ... to try to have the energy of being on stage and doing all the movement in the body because you have to exaggerate everything,” she said. “But I have always wanted to be turned into a real-life Sim, so this has been a really cool experience.”  Correction (Oct. 14, 20:24 UTC): Removes mention of Flume.

42394400,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvczFr,1634236004,"If Crypto Causes ‘Instability,’ It’s Because the System Is Unstable","I started reading Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller’s bestselling book “Irrational Exuberance” about asset bubbles recently. Wait, I should be more specific. I started reading the third edition published in 2015, during what Shiller identified as another asset run-up. The modern classic economics text was first printed in 2000, before the implosion of the “dot com boom,” and again in 2005, ahead of what turned out to be a housing market meltdown.  Shiller, you may not be surprised to learn, is not a huge fan of cryptocurrencies. He’s said interest in the sector is part of the “Wild West” mentality across stock, housing and bond markets. Something of a “perma-bear,” his dour prognostications seem to come from a place of concern about painful losses for investors of all stripes … in addition to selling books.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The Yale professor isn’t the only economist who sees bubbles everywhere. Jon Cunliffe, the Bank of England’s deputy governor for financial stability, yesterday likened the $2.3 trillion crypto market to the $1.2 trillion subprime mortgage market in 2008, which contributed to that decade’s great financial crisis. Risks aren’t localized, but shared across this interconnected, global financial system.  “The crypto world is beginning to connect to the traditional financial system, and we are seeing the emergence of leveraged players. And, crucially, this is happening in largely unregulated space,” Cunliffe said. Could a major price correction in the volatile crypto market cause knock-on effects? Cunliffe was short on specifics and also on recommendations.  Indeed, today, crypto is something more than just an economic niche. Major financial actors, from pension funds to hedge funds, are taking on exposure to crypto assets – buying bitcoin directly, buying shares in investable vehicles like trusts and even leading capital raises for crypto startups. Millions of Americans trade in crypto markets. A nation state “hodls” bitcoin.  It seems fair to “take notice,” as Cunliffe says, of an industry that has exploded in value from $16 billion five years ago to the juggernaut it is today. But concerns from financial overseers are also a bit misplaced and seem designed to scapegoat crypto for overheated financial markets that their policies enable.  Cunliffe, to his credit, wasn’t totally paternalistic. He cautioned governments and regulators against overreacting to this novel tech-driven sector and added that crypto could offer “radical improvements” to traditional financial services.  Of those improvements, he might mention, is the fact that crypto does offer a more “interconnected” economy. Crypto is something new, something frightening, something potentially dangerous because blockchains and smart contracts open access to financial services to nearly everyone. It leaches power from power brokers and decision makers.  But as much as people talk about bitcoin “decoupling” from the financial system, that seems unlikely. The full picture is still emerging – crypto sometimes moves up and down following classic inflation hedges, sometimes like tech stocks, sometimes independently. But interconnected it is, and the sector’s growth isn’t whole and away independent from the runup in asset prices across the economy.  See also: Bubbles Are Good for Bitcoin | Yanhao Max Wei  Bitcoin may be the best performing asset ever, but its growth coincided with the longest and most profitable bull market in stocks in history. The S&P 500, a benchmark, closed out a decade-long bull run beginning March 2009 with 370% returns. It’s still growing. And the same cheap money policies and “inflation is good” mentality driving it are still in play.  Shiller, the expert on how emotions and narratives drive finance, has also noted the “impressive technology” behind crypto. But always the skeptic, he also thinks its “ultimate source of value is so ambiguous that it has a lot to do with our narratives rather than reality.” That was true too, he thinks, for the 90s’ tech sector, the aught’s housing speculation and today’s meme stocks.

This rising crypto niche has caught the attention of creatives, given the opportunity to integrate their art with decentralized ecosystems. At the core, NFTs are digital collectibles that can be stored, shared or traded through emerging NFT marketplaces. While still a nascent niche, the NFT market has ballooned over the past few months to become one of the essential pillars of the crypto ecosystem. According to the latest NFT report by DappRadar, the NFT market generated $10.67 billion in trading volume over Q3. This marked a 700% increase compared to Q2. Next year looks even more promising, given the rate at which innovations are happening in the NFT ecosystem. So, what&apos;s in it for retailers and institutions? For starters, most NFT innovations follow the fundamental nature of crypto ecosystems, which is a decentralized architecture. This means that NFTs offer everyone an opportunity to become part of the metaverse in one way or the other. However, like financial markets, one has to pick the right horse to thrive as a future metaverse investor.

Putin had been asked whether he thought bitcoin or other crypto could be used as an alternative to the dollar in the context of U.S-imposed dollar-denominated economic sanctions.  Putin told CNBC on Wednesday that it’s too early to talk about using crypto in the trading of energy sources.  “I think it’s too early to say about the oil trade in cryptocurrency,” Putin said, though he added that he does believe crypto has value and may exist as a means of payment.  Putin, however, did stress that Russia would “have no other choice but to move transaction in other currencies,” should the U.S. continue to the use the dollar as a sanction instrument.  “This dollar is a competitive advantage. It is a universal reserve currency, and the United States today uses it to pursue political goals, and they harm their strategic and economic interests as a result,” Putin said.

42424491,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2p7Bh,1634235201,DeFi Pushes North America to Become World’s Second-Biggest Crypto Market,"Growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) has driven North America to become the world’s second-biggest largest crypto market, new research by crypto intelligence firm Chainalysis said.  North American addresses received $750 billion in crypto between July 2020 and June 2021, or 18.4% of global transactions. Central, Northern and Western Europe received $1 trillion during that time period, accounting for 25% of global volume, Chainalysis’ “2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report” found.  Monthly transaction volume in North America grew by over 1,000% between July 2020 and this past May, from $14.4 billion to $164 billion.  Chainalysis attributed the growth to DeFi, which represented 37% of total transactions in North America between July 2020 and this past June. The region’s top exchange during that time period was decentralized trading platform Uniswap, followed by centralized exchange Coinbase and decentralized dYdX.  The U.S., the region’s largest market, topped Chainalysis’ DeFi Adoption Index, which measures “grassroots adoption” of DeFi.  Both North America and East Asia saw a slight dip in total transaction volume in May. The decline in activity in East Asia is likely explained by Beijing’s crackdown on crypto, which started with a State Council proclamation in May. China has historically been the world’s biggest bitcoin mining country and a major hub for crypto trading.  East Asia has long lost its edge  East Asia’s share of global crypto transaction volume started dropping in April 2020, long before this year’s crackdown on the industry by Chinese authorities, research by Chainalysis shows.  Starting April 2019, East Asia accounted for the lion’s share of crypto transactions globally, until June 2020, when it was overtaken by Central, Northern and Western Europe, as well as by North America, the report said.  China accounted for 47% of these transactions between July 2020 and June of this year, Chainalysis economist Ethan McMahon told CoinDesk in an email interview.  When asked about the drop in East Asia’s share of global crypto transactions in April 2020, McMahon said that “China has been moving towards an outright crypto ban in favor of its own solutions” for a while, adding that China started testing its own central bank digital currency that month.  From July 2020 to June 2021, East Asian countries also fell several places in the Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index; China fell from fourth place to 13th, South Korea from 17th to 40th, Hong Kong from 23rd to 39th and Japan from 71st to 80th.  DeFi is also gaining ground in East Asia. Huobi is the region’s most popular exchange, according to the research, followed by decentralized exchanges dYdX and Uniswap.  Hong Kong is the region’s top DeFi adopter, where it accounts for 55% of transactions, followed by China at 49%, Japan at 32% and South Korea at 15%.  Mining  Since China’s State Council called for a crackdown on crypto mining in May, China’s miners have been moving their facilities overseas, primarily to North America, Central Asia and South America.  Between May and June, Binance saw the biggest decline in bitcoin received from mining pools, over $200 million, Chainalysis said. Huobi saw the second-biggest net decline, at just over $150 million, followed by FTX at around $100 million.  This lost liquidity might also account for the overall decline in activity in the region after May, said the intelligence firm.  North America’s share of the global mining hashrate more than doubled between the end of April and August, research from the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance shows. By August, China’s hashrate had virtually dropped to zero, according to the center.  For mining pools not based in China, proceeds have more than doubled between January and July 2021, Chainalysis said. Those based in China saw their earnings decline by 50%, according to the report.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | RESEARCH,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/14/defi-pushes-n-america-to-worlds-second-biggest-crypto-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84637f365897cc8252aef8b76bba5fab628902fb-5368x3579.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424490,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2p75h,1634235145,China’s Zhejiang Busts GPU Mining Operation in Public Facilities,"Authorities in China’s eastern Zhejiang province busted a mining operation that had set up graphics processing units in a publicly funded facility to mine bitcoin and ethereum, according to a WeChat post by the province’s Cyberspace Administration.  Zhejiang launched the investigation in early September, before China’s top financial and tech watchdogs called for the gradual elimination of crypto mining. They were looking for people who were using government, Communist Party, state-owned enterprises, and research institutions’ resources to mine crypto.  The operation screened 4,699 internet protocol addresses suspected of participating in crypto mining and picked out 184 IP addresses belonging to 77 public entities.  An inspection team then visited the facilities of 20 of the public entities affiliated with 119 IP addresses.  The team was comprised of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Provincial Party Committee’s Cyberspace Administration, the Provincial Communications Administration, the Provincial Public Security Department and the Zhejiang branch of the National Security Center.  Photos posted by the Zhejiang Cyberspace Agency shows stacks of GPUs, commonly used in ethereum and filecoin mining, but also sometimes used in bitcoin mining.  Ethereum and filecoin mining on GPUs is generally harder to locate because it doesn’t have the same high energy requirement that bitcoin mining has and doesn’t require specialized equipment, known as crypto mining application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).  These types of mining activities were relatively unaffected by a crackdown that started in May, compared with bitcoin mining.  Whereas bitcoin mining in China took a big hit to the point that it has been virtually eliminated from the country, Ethereum’s hashrate has continued on a steady upward trend.  Around the same time that Zhejiang started the probe, Hebei province in northern China announced a similar investigation, targeting government facilities and universities.  A Sept. 24 notice posted by China’s highest economic planning body, the National Reform and Development Commission, also called for investigations into crypto mines set up in government-funded big data and high-tech parks.  The Zhejiang announcement seems to confirm social media posts claiming that agencies across China are screening IP addresses for potentially illicit mining.  China is grappling with its worst power shortages in a decade, and Zhejiang is one of the hardest hit provinces.

Staring down these changes, Banco Hipotecario, a national commercial bank in El Salvador, has started working with four companies that will develop blockchain products they say will increase financial inclusion for the bank’s customers.  The bank started working with an alliance formed by TESOBE, the company behind the Open Bank Project, and API3, a decentralized autonomous organization that provides data feeds to blockchain-based smart contracts.  The alliance also includes decentralized digital asset management infrastructure firm Qredo, and Sovryn, a decentralized bitcoin trading and lending platform.  “We are working with the bank to figure out what kind of steps need to be done, so that we can put our technologies together,” said Robert Rico, Head of Open Banking at API3, who also said the Central Bank of El Salvador and government officials were a part of the exploratory talks.  Rico added that there is still no estimated date for the launch of any product.  The products could be related to bitcoin payments or bitcoin holding in balance sheets or personal portfolios, Qredo COO Josh Goodbody said.  According to Edan Yago, co-founder of Sovryn, there could be custody products with the ability to provide information from the bank through APIs to the blockchain and vice versa, in addition to the development of lending and trading services, and bitcoin-backed stablecoins.  According to the announcement, Qredo’s decentralized custodial infrastructure will aid bitcoin banking in El Salvador, while Sovryn will provide an infrastructure “to enable traditional banks to offer bitcoin-native DeFi products such as lending, trading and bitcoin backed-stablecoins to their customers.”  The feedback from the bank was “very positive,” Goodbody added.  So far the alliance is only working with Banco Hipotecario, the companies told CoinDesk.  “The Bitcoin Law is very vast because it essentially allows people to either accept bitcoin or the U.S. dollar, and we want to make sure that we help in that process as much as possible,” Rico said.  Simon Redfern, CEO of TESOBE and founder of the Open Bank Project, said in a statement that the combined technologies will help Banco Hipotecario deliver more transparent and inclusive financial services to Salvadorans – especially the underbanked part of the population.  He also said the joint effort will remove many of the uncertainties that stand between El Salvador and the advantages of cryptocurrency adoption.  Banco Hipotecario de El Salvador is one of the country’s four state-owned banks, along with Banco de Fomento Agropecuario, Banco de Desarrollo de El Salvador (Bandesal) and Banco Central de Reserva – El Salvador’s Central Bank – which does not issue its own currency as the U.S. dollar and bitcoin are used as legal tender.  “This alliance is a great opportunity for El Salvador to create new financial products that support the needs of our Salvadoran citizens,” said Celina Padilla, president of Bank Hipotecario de El Salvador, in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/07/el-salvadors-state-owned-banco-hipotecario-taps-four-crypto-startups-for-blockchain-solutions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2bfa7d520e73e7fcfc6f6ad9f29df598e4f8563-5620x3685.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This upcoming decentralized market is based on blockchain technology, whose fundamental infrastructure is supported by several nodes instead of an overarching central authority. Blockchain nodes can be compared to small servers - their primary role is to store the blocks of data that make up a blockchain network. These decentralized nodes are connected and facilitate the exchange of the latest blockchain data for the network to stay updated. Simply put, nodes are the support system of blockchain environments. While the concept may sound technical, a node can be a computer, laptop, or other devices, including smartphones. Today, we have many blockchain networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin whose operations are facilitated by node validators. Node Validation The process of node validation involves allocating resources such as memory and computational power to store data and verify transactions that are added to a blockchain network. For instance, the Bitcoin blockchain uses a Proof-of-work (PoW) consensus, requiring miners to allocate resources for transaction validation and secure the network. In return, the miners are rewarded with network rewards for each block added to the blockchain. Currently, the network reward on the Bitcoin network is at 6.25 BTC following the May 2020 halving.

The foundation will stack 1.32 million stacks tokens (STX) for Brink, which it estimates will yield $165,000 in bitcoin in one year, according to a Stacks blog post. The funds will be paid directly to Brink’s wallet every two weeks.  The pair have set up a website to track the progress of the stacking process. According to the site, they have raised BTC 0.178 ($10,378) so far.  The Stacks Foundation supports development of Stacks, a network of decentralized apps and smart contracts built on the Bitcoin blockchain, according to its website. Stacking is similar to Ethereum staking: Users can earn rewards for locking their tokens on the network. On the Stack network, the reward is a 10%-12% annual percentage yield of their funds, and while earning that, they are supporting the security of the blockchain, according to the blog post.  Brink is an organization that aims to support the Bitcoin’s open-source developers.

42396733,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT54qz,1634230809,Strike Users in US Can Now Get Paid in Bitcoin,"Strike, the startup best known for helping El Salvador adopt bitcoin, is letting its U.S. users instantly convert all or a portion of their paychecks into the original cryptocurrency. And they can do so without needing their employers to embrace bitcoin or carry it on their books.  The Pay Me in Bitcoin option, introduced Thursday, allows users to deposit their salaries directly to their Strike accounts and choose the amount that is automatically swapped and credited to their bitcoin balance. Strike is not charging a fee for the service.  Strike began experimenting with the feature last year when National Football League player Russell Okung used Strike to split his $13 million salary 50-50 between bitcoin and fiat. Several other athletes have since followed in his footsteps. Now the service has been made widely available to Strike’s U.S. customers.  The expanded feature comes less than a month after Coinbase, the leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it will let users deposit all or part of their paychecks in crypto or dollars, also without a fee.  However, unlike Coinbase, which lists a smorgasbord of digital assets for trading, Strike is a staunchly bitcoin-focused shop.  Bitcoin as a savings vehicle  Founder and CEO Jack Mallers framed the bitcoin conversion option as a way for users to build wealth and save for things like their kids’ education or homeownership at a time when inflation is rearing its head and interest rates on savings accounts languish just above zero.  “You simply cannot save by holding dollars,” Mallers wrote in a blog post.  Although bitcoin’s price fluctuates wildly from minute to minute, proponents note that over time it has generally appreciated.  Mallers made waves this year with an impassioned speech at the Bitcoin 2021 conference about his work in El Salvador, which culminated in President Nayib Bukele’s adoption of the currency as legal tender. In the U.S., the Chicago-based entrepreneur sent a shot across the bows of Coinbase, PayPal, Square’s Cash App and other services by offering bitcoin purchases for nearly zero in fees. Strike is also making the technology behind Twitter’s bitcoin tipping feature open to the world through an application programming interface (API).  The bitcoin conversion feature is available in the U.S. except for New York and Hawaii, a Strike spokesperson said.

42424660,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVgRh,1634229991,15 NFT Use Cases That Could Go Mainstream,"Steph Curry. Eminem. Paris Hilton. Mark Cuban. The full list of celebrities who have embraced non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – whether through creating, collecting or hawking – seemingly grows longer by the hour, and it runs the gamut from Rob Gronkowski to Lil Nas X.  NFTs are here. They’re no longer fringe. Specifically, art and collectible NFTs have gone mainstream with breathtaking speed – faster than even the most starry-eyed, to-the-moon crypto bull could have dreamed. We now have a better idea of why. As I wrote in the beginning of this cycle, NFTs (especially art and collectibles) are fun, visualizable, culturally relevant and they’re easy to understand in a way that many blockchain concepts are not.  Jeff Wilser is the author of seven books including “Alexander Hamilton’s Guide to Life,” “The Book of Joe: The Life, Wit, and (Sometimes Accidental) Wisdom of Joe Biden” and an Amazon Best Book of the Month in both non-fiction and humor.  They can solve real-world problems. Just ask Daryl Morey, president of basketball operations for the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers, who told me a few months back, “I just moved from Houston to Philly, and it was a pain in the ass. I had to move 10,000 comics. I had to move all of my wall art. I had to move all of this s**t, and with digital stuff you just move it. It’s definitely superior. And it’s the start of a major, major trend.”  Read more: How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT | Jeff Wilser  Then there’s the development that many in the space – myself included – dramatically underestimated: the community angle. The social angle. When you pony up for a Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunk or World of Women NFT, it shows that you get it. It shows that you belong in the club. “People identify with them on a personal level,” said Maria Shen, a partner at Electric Capital, a blockchain-focused venture capital (VC) firm. “Ownership says something fundamental about their identity; it says something about their interests.”  This we now understand.  But what’s next?  Only a year ago, art and collectible NFTs were mostly ideas with “potential,” but no one outside the crypto space took them seriously. What categories today are in that same phase of early speculation, which are likely to erupt? What goofy-sounding NFT will get endorsed by Tom Brady in 2022? What bold, industry-disrupting NFT will Ariana Grande promote in 2023? What are the next chapters of this wild narrative?  I consulted with a brain trust of NFT insiders – investors, founders, people who live and breathe non-fungible tokens – to give us a glimpse into the (possible) future. Some of these categories will seem obvious. Some will seem far-fetched. Some might even feel absurd. Yet considered en masse, they have the potential to change how we consume content, how we spend and make money, how we prove our identities, how we attend events, how we dress or even how and where we spend the bulk of our time.  Maybe. But for now let’s start with the little blobs.  Gaming  Every day, there are 2 million people who play with the little blobs of Axie Infinity, which now has a valuation of $3 billion. “Gaming is really exciting, as you already have billions of people who are buying digital goods inside of games,” said Devin Finzer, CEO of OpenSea, the largest NFT platform. The reason we haven’t yet seen an even wider adoption, said Finzer, is that “the development cycle is a little longer with games than with simpler arts and collectible projects. There’s a little more of a delay.” He imagines we’ll see the fruits of these developments within a year or two.  Jamie Burke, CEO of Outlier Ventures (a U.K.-based blockchain VC and accelerator lab), was originally encouraged by research showing that “people spend five times more in a blockchain game than in a conventional game.” He said that skeptics originally “poo-pooed” this research, but then came Axie. The Axie juggernaut is proof, said Burke, that if the gamer can exit the game and cash out with crypto, and if they’re free to “do whatever the hell they want with the money,” then they’ll spend more money. “It feels really obvious now,” he said, predicting that Axie is just the very beginning of a much larger boom in gaming that will be “huge in the next decade.”  Fashion and wearables  “Luxury brands are coming to the NFT space,” says Laglasse, while smoking a cigarette on our Zoom call. Exhibit A: On Sept. 30, Dolce & Gabbana sold its inaugural nine-piece collection of NFTs, called “Collezione Genesi,” a surreal mix of high fashion and blockchain, for $5.6 million. The set included both physical items (like women’s dresses) and their digital companions as NFTs.  Just two weeks earlier, at London Fashion Week, a new brand called Auroboros, which describes itself as “the first fashion house to merge science and technology with physical couture,” unveiled a line of digital apparel that you “wear” using augmented reality (AR). For perspective, this was not at a crypto conference. This happened at London Fashion Week.  Or consider the collaboration between The Bored Ape Yacht Club and The Hundreds (high-end streetwear), which created merchandise for the community. “That sold out in hours,” said Shen. The fashion brands know an eager (and deep-pocketed) audience when they see one. “In 18 years, we’ve never seen anything like what’s happening on our website right now,” The Hundreds co-founder Bobby Hundreds gushed at the time. “Just wow.”  Read more: The Financialization of NFTs Raises Regulatory Issues | Will Gottsegen  Fashion wearables might just be scratching the surface. Shen imagines that NFTs could create new ways to monetize and invest in fashion. Take sneakers. “In order to flip a sneaker you have to take the physical inventory,” she said. “Imagine if you could increase the speed in which you can flip items.” Or maybe new financial instruments, fueled by NFTs, could allow people to invest in the fashion sector. “You can create financial products, like an index of the top-selling sneakers today,” said Shen, which could let you invest in a pool of the 100 hottest sneakers, for example, instead of tossing the dice on a single pair.  This is also a crossover with decentralized finance (DeFi) NFTs, which brings us to…  DeFi NFTs  Let’s say you blew your last $5 million on a CryptoPunk NFT, but now – oops! – you forgot that you need to pay your rent. No problem. You can use that CryptoPunk as collateral for a loan at NFTfi. “NFTs enable some new behaviors of assets,” said Andrew Steinwold, Managing Partner at Sfermion (an NFT investment firm) and the host of an NFT podcast.  Think about that loan. When you hand over the CryptoPunk as collateral, you automatically get it back when you pay off your debt. And if you default? Thanks to the wizardry of smart contracts, the NFT gets transferred to the lender, eliminating the need for debt collection and bounty hunters. That’s just the beginning. As my colleague David Z. Morris has written, NFTs are being fractionalized (to provide more liquidity), they’re acting as quasi-securities and they’re becoming finance-y enough that they might soon curry interest from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Burke expects the innovation to continue at a rapid clip. He imagines a rise in secondary markets, or even “derivative” markets. Imagine that for whatever reasons, Epic Games decides not to integrate NFTs into Fortnite. Perhaps some derivative NFTs could fill in the gap? “Let’s say I’ve got a sword, and it’s a really valuable sword,” said Burke. “And I want to cash out of the game. The sword is so valuable, it has the ability to pay off my student loan, or buy a house.” He continues, clearly enjoying the thought experiment: “S**t, I love my sword but I need the cash.”  Read more: How ‘World of Women’ Became a Celebrity NFT Phenom | Jeff Wilser  Right now, there’s nothing you can do about it. You’ve just got a dumb sword, and it’s stuck in Fortnite. But perhaps an NFT of the sword’s “twin” – that lives outside of Fortnite – could be bought and sold on a derivatives market, and then some kind of mechanism would allow for the transfer of funds once the transaction (the sword handover) is complete in Fortnite. These are the kind of possibilities that NFT+DeFi could unleash.  In that vein, Burke thinks it’s far more likely that we’ll see growth in the new, creative, blockchain-enabled financial products before we see the NFT-ization of things that already exist in traditional finance, such as the deed to your home. “Where’s the growth in DeFi going to come from? In this regulatory environment, it’s sure as s**t not going to be real-world assets, or anything that remotely resembles a security,” said Burke. “That’s going to be a decade-long fight.”  Events and ticketing  Another hypothetical: Drake has an upcoming concert, and you want to go. Tickets are $100. Now imagine the ticket you buy is actually an NFT, and your NFT does the following six things:  1. It’s emblazoned with some artwork from a designer you like.  2. It serves as concert memorabilia. So it might even be worth something someday, like old ticket stubs to Beatles concerts.  3. Inside the venue, you can use the NFT as a means of getting snacks or beers.  4. Thanks once again to the magic of smart contracts, the revenue from your NFT automatically pays Drake 40%, the DJ 10%, the lighting crew 2%, the janitors 1%, and on and on. No middle-person is needed to orchestrate the payments, which means you pay almost nothing in fees.  5. If you bought the VIP ticket, the NFT unlocks your access to visit Drake backstage, or maybe it gives you exclusive access to future digital goodies.  6. Amazingly, the NFT gives you the right to be not just an event-goer, but even a shareholder in Drake’s concert. This NFT functions as concert equity, and you’ll get a small slice of the profits. If things break right? Maybe you’ll even make money by attending the show.  This future is closer than you might think. “What excites us is NFTs being used in the real world,” said Carolin Wend, co-founder of Mintbase, an NFT-minting platform. Take an upcoming festival in Lisbon, the NEARCon, which is anchored around the NEARProtocol, a smart contracts system that Mintbase uses instead of Ethereum. “The festival founder wants to do 100% NFT ticketing,” said Wend, and this could (one day) include “staking” your ticket, meaning that you could earn a profit on what you plunk down for the ticket.  Read more: Daryl Morey on Crypto and NFTs: ‘It’s the Start of a Major, Major Trend’ | Jeff Wilser  Some of these capabilities are still off in the future, but even at the Lisbon festival (held Oct. 26th), Wend expects them to “QR the heck out of the space,” so that people can scan QR codes to do things like redeem their NFTs for burritos. This last bit is not hypothetical. In Lisbon, said Wend, “We will be doing burrito NFTs.”  NFT community platforms  Remember those Dolce & Gabbana NFTs? Now imagine that you’re the lucky person who bought one. Pretend you’re the proud owner of the crown jewel of the set – literally a crown – called the “Doge Crown,” an almost comically ornate piece of jewelry. (Alas, the “Doge” refers to the Doge Palace in Venice, not the Shiba.) The crown looks like it came straight out of “Game of Thrones.” How do you store it? Maybe you keep the physical crown in your private vault, or perhaps you showcase it, modestly and tastefully, atop the throne room in your Mykonos villa.  But what about the digital NFT? What do you do with it? Or as Burke puts it, “Where do you flex that?” Think about it from Dolce & Gabbana’s perspective. “If you’re a high-end luxury brand, it’s all about controlling the retail experience,” said Burke. He guesses that trying to render such a lovely, intricate crown in a pixelated metaverse like Decentraland might – at least in today’s version – make for a “pretty sh**ty wearable.” (Burke notes that for this very reason, Dolce & Gabbana is giving the buyer of the NFT two years to figure out where to render it.)  So Burke predicts some kind of environment where people can gather, chat and flaunt their NFTs. Maybe it’s a form of AR, or maybe virtual reality (VR), or maybe something Web 3.0-ish or maybe something else entirely. The point is that there needs to be a good environment for experiencing NFTs. “What are the platforms of networks? That’s going to be the big trend,” said Burke.  Shen has a similar idea with a different twist. She envisions “a home for NFT communities,” or, more precisely, “a social network that’s made for NFT owners.” Perhaps this network is connected to your wallet that owns a Bored Ape, and it can only be accessed by verified users who own certain NFTs.  Or maybe they just hang out in the metaverse? Which leads us to…  Metaverse  “The metaverse is going to be one of the future game-changers of the NFT space,” said Maxime Laglasse, the head of content at Nonfungible.com. The short version: the metaverse can be a place to store and appreciate NFT art, it’s a hub for gaming, it’s Zuckerberg’s new mission in life for a reason and perhaps it’s an evolved version of how we’re all hanging out online anyways. (You can get my long version here, and an even longer version here.)  Virtual land  A wise investor once said, “Land. It’s the one thing they can’t make more of.” The investor was Lex Luthor. And his advice might ring true in the metaverse. Virtual worlds like Decentraland, The Sandbox and Cryptovoxels give their real-estate a hard cap, meaning that – in theory – a finite supply will become more valuable if the demand soars.  Read more: Here Comes the Virtual Real Estate Boom | Janine Yorio  “This is quite promising,” said Matty “DCLBlogger,” an influential voice in the NFT community who has been something of an oracle, dashing off a widely-shared Twitter thread in 2020 – over a year ago! – that outlined 25 future use cases of NFT. The thread looks prescient, correctly calling the rise of art, collectibles and gaming. Matty is just as bullish on virtual land. “Look at Axie Infinity,” he said. “There are a million-plus players,” and some of these players will think, “maybe it makes sense to own that land.”  Once you begin to wrap your brain around the idea that people could profit from digital real estate, the possibilities are dizzying. Maybe you own a plot of land, you build a virtual office building, and then you rent out the building for a virtual conference. And when the conference attendees want to blow off some steam, maybe they’ll want to gamble during their cocktail hour, so you rent out a casino game that lets them win and lose real cryptocurrency. As Matty said, “It gets real crazy.”  Digital identity  Self-sovereign identity (SSID) has long been one of the most intriguing applications of blockchain technology, and NFTs could be the key that unlocks the door. (Why does SSID matter? Here’s my primer from last year.) Laglasse views Ethereum Name Services, or ENS, as a useful example. “Now you can link your Instagram account, your Twitter account, and almost every social media account to ENS,” said Laglasse. “Since it’s decentralized, you can truly own the name you show to the community.”  Laglasse categorizes these as “Utility NFTs,” in the sense that you can’t typically exchange them for money (like art and collectibles), but instead they exist to prove that you own something. Another idea in the same vein: NFTs of college diplomas. This would let a Vietnamese student travel to the U.S., for example, and decisively prove that she has a diploma. Laglasse predicts, “It’s going to happen one day.”  Social media and influence  This one’s a little squishy, a little tough to visualize. But stick with it. “Think about all the digital value created through social media platforms,” said Burke. He’s referring to that elusive and hard-to-quantify concept of “online influence.” Currently, Burke argues, the only real way to monetize that influence is through advertising, and the influencer only earns a small slice of the revenue pie. But what if this influence could be quantified, scored, and captured as an NFT?  Read more: The Bored Ape Founders Haven’t Yet Joined the Yacht Club | Jeff Wilser  This “Influence NFT,” let’s call it, wouldn’t be as simple as just rewarding the number of Twitter followers. “It’s a form of atomized socialness,” explained Burke, where “I can atomize every bit of content, and I can quantify the relationship I have with my community.” He said this NFT might factor in variables like online reputation, trustworthiness or even the ability to curate and create good content. “This is the hardest one to explain,” he said with a laugh.  Remember the “Klout” score, in Twitter’s early days, where an algorithm tried to quantify users’ social mojo? Klout never seemed to catch on, and it went belly-up in 2018, but you can see the idea’s (arguably evil) appeal. “Literally any form of digital value flow could, in theory, be turned into an asset,” said Burke, who also envisions this NFT being plugged into a DeFi ecosystem, such as being used as collateral in a loan.  Shen thinks of this concept as a more refined version of a credit score, but one for credibility and influence. “You can actually have NFTs that form parts of your identity and reputation,” she said. She points to the example of Rabbithole.gg, where users can earn cryptocurrencies, tokens or NFTs by proving that they have certain skills or have completed certain tasks, such as registering for an ENS name.  Steinwold likes another example: Galaxy.eco aims to use on-chain data to reward people for certain verifiable activities. Maybe if you have 1,000 trades on Uniswap, you earn a Master Trader badge. Or if you’re a big and longtime holder, you get Diamond Hands. Maybe I should mint you an NFT if you can prove you’ve read this far in the piece.  Music  “The industry as a whole definitely needs some disruption,” said Matty, who expects that music will eventually take off in the same way as art and collectibles. Perhaps this has started. Shawn Mendes, Grimes and Snoop Dogg have all dipped into NFTs, discovering new ways to both monetize and engage with fans. Kings of Leon weren’t content to simply release an album as an NFT; they were so enthused that they played their NFT in space.  Live Nation wants to do for music what Top Shot did for the NBA – capturing “moments” as collectibles. “We’ve all learned from Top Shot at the NBA,” CEO Michael Rapino said on an earnings call, adding that he wants Live Nation to create “magic moments that we could mint and attach to our ongoing ticket festivals and special moments.”  Or maybe NFTs, music and DeFi could all merge. “If music masters could be actually pooled and then fractionalized, you could then receive income as dividends for streaming,” said Shen. She then whips up another possibility: Imagine if the rights to each song are captured as an NFT, and then you pool together the top 40 songs of the month, you fractionalize the pool, and then you could buy a piece of that pool and receive streaming income. “That would be interesting,” she said, “We just haven’t gotten to that point yet.”  Four more quick ones  Health care: “In the health industry, it’s going to be huge,” said Laglasse, who imagines that NFTs can be used to safeguard the confidentiality of health records, as well as tighten supply-chain tracking of medications.  Advertising: Here’s a curveball. “Advertising is not something people pay attention to,” said Matty. But he asks, “Why wouldn’t websites sell NFTs that give people the right to certain media spots?” All of this is in play.  Read more: Play-to-Earn Is Already the Biggest Star in the Metaverse | Jeff Wilser  Fantasy Sports: Sorare already has a foothold in the global game of soccer. It doesn’t take much imagination to see this catching fire with the NFL and the mega-industry of fantasy football.  NFT Search: “Right now, NFTs are this interesting but muddled and chaotic category,” said Shen, adding that they “look a lot like websites in the 90s before Google came in.” She has a point. There’s no clean search function for NFTs … yet. Imagine a Google for NFTs. Or a decentralized Google for NFTs.  And finally, the most maximalist scenario:  Digitalization of everything physical  “A lot of people still don’t realize how large NFTs are going to be,” said Steinwold. “They’re going to be used for anything. All forms of value will be represented as an NFT.” This is a bold statement. I ask him if I heard him correctly. All forms of value will be represented by NFTs?  Why is he so confident?  “We’re spending most of our waking hours online,” Steinwold reasons, arguing that this is a trend that will continue to accelerate in the next 20 or 30 years, and that soon “we’re going to have a lot of digital goods.” In the future, said Steinwold, if he buys a cool pair of Air Jordans (physical ones that go on your feet), he’ll want its NFT companion. He’ll want the NFT so he can flaunt it, flex it and perhaps to use it in a metaverse or a play-to-earn game.  “Maybe not this chair,” he said and pointed to his chair over the Zoom, laughing a bit. But he expects people will eventually want NFTs of their wine, baseball cards, rare coins, watches, cars – you name it – and “that’s the way the world is going to go.”  Maybe that sounds far-fetched. But only a year ago, so did the idea of mainstream NFTs for art and collectibles.",POSITIVE,ENS,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | ENS,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/14/15-nft-use-cases-that-could-go-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e8464713bb9ee59445deb2945ee15c010fd32d7-3542x1992.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The heat source will be introduced in 2022 and will prevent 20,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas per megawatt from entering the atmosphere compared with natural gas, according to a statement shared with CoinDesk.  MintGreen’s proprietary “Digital Boilers” recover 96% of the electricity used for bitcoin mining as heat that is then used to supply communities and for industrial processes.  The company uses an “immersion” technology that captures the heat generated in mining and goes to hot water utilities known as “District Energy,” which is then distributed to the customers, MintGreen’s CEO, Colin Sullivan, explained to CoinDesk in an interview.  The utility working with MintGreen serves about 100 buildings and the company will sell the heat under a contractual long-term agreement, Sullivan added.  On March 16, digital asset manager CoinShares said it participated in MintGreen’s seed investment round, noting that the miner’s “immersion” system captures and transfers the heat generated by crypto mining servers to industrial-scale hot water utilities.  Using heat from bitcoin mining is not new; rather, it has been happening around the world on a smaller scale.  MintGreen aims to have the system up and running by winter of next year in what would be the first deployment of the company’s technology on a large scale, according to Sullivan.

Hari Sevugan, a former Washington operative who has held senior staff positions for multiple high-profile statesmen, will manage public-facing communications for Uniswap Labs, including “helping the company tell its story to existing users and new audiences and managing media affairs,” per a Uniswap spokesperson.  Sevugan previously served as former President Barack Obama’s senior spokesperson for the 2008 presidential campaign, the deputy campaign manager for brand and media for former Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign and as the national press secretary for the Democratic National Committee.  In a written interview with CoinDesk, Sevugan noted he had some tech experience as well, having “worked with several tech companies and with founders at a political-tech incubator.”  A spokesperson told CoinDesk that Sevugan was introduced to the team via “mutual connections in the technology space.”  The hire comes during a turbulent period for the DeFi ecosystem. Regulatory storm clouds are gathering, and officials from multiple countries are calling for stringent oversight of the emerging financial vertical now worth over $216 billion, per DeFi Llama.

Aurora, a project built on the NEAR blockchain allowing for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) contracts to run on the chain, has completed an equity fundraising of $12 million at a $150 million valuation.  The round was led by Pantera Capital and Electric Capital, but included over 100 investors by virtue of an “ecosystem bucket” accounting for the majority of the funding.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Aurora founder Alex Shevchenko said that the goal of the round was to help expand the early ecosystem via placement with strategic partners, including Dodo, 1inch, The Graph and Covalent.  “The idea was to align the incentives, and to tell many, many people about Aurora so they can track the project from the beginning,” Shevchenko said.  Backed by a team of 25, Aurora is looking to position itself as a complement to Ethereum rather than a competitor. Once a self-described competitor to Ethereum, a successful rebrand as a scaling solution has led to significant success for Polygon, formerly Matic.  Unlike Polygon, however, Shevchenko noted that Aurora has no utility token, and uses ETH natively for gas – users simply need to wrap ETH and port it across the Aurora bridge, which has processed $100 million in volume to date.

Forthcoming projects include additional bridges and non-fungible token (NFT) platforms, as well as key infrastructure from data provider The Graph and an as-yet-unannounced oracle solution that may lead to lending projects.  There also may be an incentive program on the way, matching similar big-budget efforts from Avalanche, Harmony and Fantom.  “No blockchain project at this point in time is able to survive without any liquidity mining or incentive program,” Shevchenko said. “As such, Aurora Labs is planning to propose to the Aurora DAO to launch a liquidity mining program.”  The Aurora governance token has yet to launch.

42396738,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT54uv,1634215903,Bitcoin Mining After the China Ban: US Dominance Is Set to Continue,"Following China’s sweeping crackdown on the crypto industry, the U.S. has taken the bitcoin mining mantle for the first time – and industry CEOs don’t see the trend stopping anytime soon.  “I foresee the U.S. continuing to play a leadership role in terms of share because of the jurisdiction,” Bryan Bullett, CEO of mining firm Bit Digital, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Nobody wants to operate in a region where they face existential risks,” he added.  In fact, the Bitcoin network’s hashrate, the measure of computational resources used to conduct mining activities, has recovered from its July lows, even after China’s ban forced miners to shut down their operations in the country. The Bitcoin network’s hashrate has risen about 117% to 133 exahashes per second as of Tuesday from its July low of 61 EH/s, according to data analytics firm Glassnode.  The new report from Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) now confirms that since the China ban, miners outside the country, mainly from the U.S., have taken over bitcoin’s global mining operations. The U.S. accounted for 35.4% of the global hashrate at of the end of August, more than double the 16.8% it had at the end of April.  Meanwhile, mining operations in mainland China have effectively dropped to zero, down from a high of 75.53% of the world’s total bitcoin mining hashrate in September 2019. Kazakhstan and Russia now follow the U.S. with hashrate shares of 18.1% and 11%, respectively, up from 8.2% and 6.8% in April, according to the CCAF report.  Geopolitics of bitcoin mining  For any industry to operate a profitable business, a safe jurisdiction is one of the key considerations, and the fact that the U.S. has a stable, transparent regulatory regime that considers the industry before making any changes to the law is the main reason why the U.S. will continue to increase its market share and maintain its top mantle, Bullett said.  Geopolitical certainty aside, miners in the U.S. also enjoy better access to infrastructure and a lower cost of power, according Dave Perrill, CEO of data centers operator Compute North. “I think the U.S. will continue to be the leader, both at scale, cost and geopolitical risks,” Perrill said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Adding to the winning recipe for the U.S., Paul Prager, chairman and CEO of miner TeraWulf, said, “I think that the primary reason China sort of missed the ball here is because they couldn’t control it, and Bitcoin is all about transparency, democratic values and decentralization.” He also suggested that the U.S. has a great regulatory environment, a “rule of law” and large availability of power, which is attracting more miners to the country.  Test case for Bitcoin’s resilience  The great migration of miners to the U.S. has created a unique situation for the whole crypto universe, as the world will be watching to see if a government can shut down a technology that’s supposed to be decentralized.  “There are clearly countries that are able to shut down the web or at least control what citizens are able to see on the web. The jury is still out on whether governments could apply similar controls on blockchain, which is likely to be the biggest systematic risk to the technology,” said Max Galka, founder and CEO of blockchain analytics firm Elementus.  Read more: China FUD Over Bitcoin Mining Is ‘Now Moot,’ Luxor Report Says  The China ban presents an “interesting test case” to see if a government can actually ban this technology and how industry participants react to such moves, Galka said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk.  “If China puts this ban in place and the activity manages to continue anyway, I think then banning cryptocurrency no longer becomes an option for governments,” he added.  Regardless of how China’s dynamics play out, the regulatory certainties, access to cheaper power and ability to build out infrastructure needed for a smooth mining operation will likely help keep the U.S. its top position in the mining industry.  “Given all those reasons, it makes sense that we’ve been dominant in mining bitcoin, and we’re going to continue to enhance the positions that we have as we go forward,” TeraWulf’s Prager said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/13/bitcoin-mining-after-the-china-ban-us-dominance-is-set-to-continue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/baccc2edd74d3269a1f6a7f8ae9556d16465d67f-7680x4320.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394406,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvczkd,1634215800,Are Cryptocurrencies Secure? Yes and No – Here’s Why,"The blockchain technology underlying cryptocurrencies represents a great leap forward in security, yet some crypto investors have found themselves on the receiving end of multimillion-dollar hacks, fraud and other attacks.  What explains the simultaneous security and vulnerability of these digital assets, and what can advisors do to help their clients who may be at risk?  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  We have to understand that while transactions on a blockchain can be very secure, crypto assets themselves have similar vulnerabilities to other investments and wealth management technology, said Sid Yenamandra, the CEO of Entreda, a cybersecurity services provider for wealth management firms.  “Cryptocurrencies, specifically the underlying technology, blockchain, through its distributed ledger technology and the ability to decentralize control, inherently has a certain level of security built into its technology,” said Yenamandra. “But it is not a panacea. There are still a lot of vulnerabilities that can exist today, even in a blockchain environment. The attacks that exist, that we’ve seen, vary, some are tech related, some lie on the border between cybersecurity and privacy.”  Why are blockchain transactions secure? Yenamandra said that by creating a distributed ledger that breaks actions into blocks and spreads those blocks of work across different computational systems and relying on consensus to validate transactions, blockchains are technically inherently secure – but that doesn’t mean they’re invulnerable.  Who used this token?  In its earliest years, Bitcoin proliferated as a pseudo-anonymous mode of transactions across the internet – even underpinning illicit business across the so-called “dark web” of unsearchable websites. It’s this checkered past that keeps some advisors, like Scott Eichler, founder and principal at Standing Oak Advisors, a Newport Beach, California-based RIA, from investing in the space.  It also raises interesting regulatory questions.  “If a bitcoin or some other type of crypto is transferred between two bad actors, for a bad use, and that is in the ledger, at what point is the bitcoin allowed completely back into the fray? Also, if I can see that a drug lord had this cryptocurrency token, and now I have it, am I contributing to the problem? Am I complicit? Do I have to delete that bitcoin? Can I advise on that?” asked Eichler.  Regulation as protection  One area of vulnerability is the still-evolving regulations governing cryptocurrencies, said Katie Horvath, chief marketing office for Aunalytics, which provides data platform and management services for businesses.  “Investing in cryptocurrencies is going to be risky because of the general lack of regulation,” said Horvath. “A fraud risk is definitely there. When we look at security, the old approach was perimeter security that put all people and data within a single building and set up a firewall. Nowadays the approach is users and credentials, and managed access for devices too, because people are now working from anywhere.”  Aunalytics now mines transactional data for banks every night using artificial intelligence, and is able to recognize customers who may be at risk for cryptocurrency fraud by virtue of their demographic group and having held-away crypto assets, which allows bank wealth managers to reach out and offer those customers investment options with more risk control.  The weakest link is ... us  A.I. that can identify vulnerable crypto investors is not just a cool development, it may eventually become a must-have for financial advisors across the industry. Just as in any wealth management setting, the end-client, or investor, is the weakest link, said Yenamandra.  “Some of the issues we’ve seen in reality and practice are related to missing keys, because you have this key exchange mechanism between the participants in a transaction and what happens is that sometimes those keys are stolen,” said Yenamandra. “This most recently happened in the AIPAC region with Bitfinex, a crypto exchange where a bunch of keys were stolen [in 2016]. That allows people to triangulate between keys and users and figure out a way to reverse engineer transactions. The loss of keys is a cyber event, and a big vulnerability.”  Another vulnerability lies in cryptocurrencies’ reliance on technology and code transference, said Yenamandra, as any code can be exploited.  But there are structural weaknesses, too, in the third-party vendors. Cryptocurrency transactions rely on servers, often domiciled in distant countries, transferring code from point to point – but blockchain infrastructure also relies on users who have access to the servers, and the individual devices and computers are also vulnerable.  “With a blockchain, there is a lot of data moving from system-to-system-to-system, which makes the inherent network vulnerable if hackers were to do denial of service attacks or disrupt but not decipher what is going on in the communication between systems,” said Yenamandra. “Disrupting these systems would cause performance challenges and take away from what the blockchain promises to deliver. There are also potential vulnerabilities in routing networks.”  What can advisors do?  Advisors should educate themselves, and pass that knowledge on to their clients in easily digestible chunks.  “Get educated on phishing attempts, because blockchain is similar to the Venmo-based model, all your transactions are public and everyone knows how you are interacting,” said Yenamandra. “People will know if you’re doing a lot of trading with bitcoin, ether or doge, which makes you vulnerable as an end user. The weakest link from a security standpoint is always the user. In the wealth management chain, it’s always the client. They may expose themselves to an attack, but from a regulatory standpoint the axe usually falls on the advisor. The same thing will happen here.”  While the urge among advisors may be to usher their clients into a separately managed crypto account or private fund, Horvath argues that many clients will prefer to hold their assets directly, and advisors must be aware of potential risks.  “A good way to deepen a client relationship is to reach out and call clients who are investing in cryptocurrencies and offer them education, help make them aware of the risks, and make sure clients know you care,” she said. “Most wealth managers are going to want to try to offer a different type of investment that might be more secure, but it won’t necessarily meet the needs or desires of the investors who are really interested in crypto.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/14/are-cryptocurrencies-secure-yes-and-no-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05161302c40e4a95f17d739062516428e1b625d5-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394408,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvczut,1634215800,How Should You Treat Crypto Compared With Other Assets in a Portfolio?,"With popular platforms like Cash App, PayPal and Venmo offering easy ways to buy bitcoin and altcoins, a broader swath of consumers is getting the chance to own crypto.  But that doesn’t mean everybody is approaching owning and investing in crypto strategically. There’s a difference between buying a few hundred dollars’ worth of bitcoin and using a crypto exchange like Coinbase to round out your portfolio the same way rappers, sports stars and the mega-rich hold onto fine art, luxury watches and rare footwear.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  Many financial planners would say this: If artwork, sneakers and other alternative investments are considered speculative or volatile, then crypto seems like the wild, wild west.  At least that’s the opinion of Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a New York-based certified financial planner and co-founder of the financial planning firm 2050 Wealth Partners.  “You got new crypto communities, new coins that are coming out, new taxes and new platforms,” Braxton says. Some people use crypto to make purchases through apps or online, while others buy it on popular exchange platforms with the intent to hold on to it in case its value keeps climbing.  So how should a person treat crypto compared with the cash savings and securities they have in their portfolio? And if you are drawn to crypto as an investment, how much of your portfolio should you devote to such a nascent asset class?  Adding crypto to a portfolio  According to Braxton, the right amount to invest in crypto is “generally not more than what you’re willing to lose.”  Meanwhile, Dave Abner, global head of business development at Gemini, a crypto trading app, looks at cryptocurrency as neither an asset class nor a currency – although, in his words, “there are pieces of it that people use to buy and sell things.”  This kind of nuance is exactly why people are drawn to crypto in the first place – but also why it can be so confusing.  While Abner doesn’t consider himself to be among the “crypto OGs” (original gangsters) like his bosses, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, he can speak to how people originally conceptualized adding crypto to their investment portfolio back when bitcoin became popular in the early 2010s.  “The first thing people really heard about – especially within the financial advisor community – was bitcoin as a potential inflation hedge for their portfolio and pretty much as a substitute for gold,” Abner says.  The main facet of bitcoin that makes it work as an inflation hedge is its fixed issuance, he says. There’s only a limited amount that can ever be available – 21 million bitcoins, to be exact.  That built-in scarcity certainly turns heads “at a time when the U.S. is printing a ton of money and advisors are thinking about what they can do to protect the real value of their portfolios,” Abner says.  On top of its properties as a potential inflation hedge, crypto is based on a blockchain technology that contains all kinds of potential as an infrastructure system that’s more efficient than we’ve ever seen before. We’ve already started to see the possibilities with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have given rise to conversations about a better way to issue smart tickets and property deeds.  “It’s a more modern type of platform for businesses and transactions to take place on and to be recorded on,” Abner says about the crypto world and blockchain technology.  Approaching a crypto investment  But even though crypto and blockchain technology have such potential, many financial advisors and planners tell clients to put crypto in the speculative bucket. Braxton recommends clients max out their crypto investments at only 5% of their portfolios and make sure that they have done their due diligence before buying. That means covering the basics first: a strong emergency fund, a retirement account such as a 401(k) or an individual retirement account (IRA), or both, and a passive brokerage account composed of index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Your crypto money should be your “play money,” Braxton says.  However, Braxton adds that a person’s risk tolerance also contributes to whether their “play money” starts at $50 or $5,000. Your risk tolerance is a combination of your personality and general “gut check” attitude toward volatility and, of course, your financial safety nets in place. Don’t go betting your entire life savings on crypto, Braxton notes, but if you can afford to participate, the potential benefits are big.  Tax implications TBD  For instance, those who purchased cryptocurrency years ago and haven’t spent it yet might be sitting on a significant appreciation in value. According to Abner, the tax implications of selling an abundance of coin at a high profit are so new that people are waiting to see what kind of taxes they would owe on gains before they sell it off.  “A lot of people who have had those gains don’t want to sell. So if you bought bitcoin at $100 and it’s now [valued] at $45,000, you have a gain that could lead to an incredible tax bill at some point,” he says.  What those tax bills might amount to is still unknown. There’s not much clarity now on the tax implications of selling crypto – though it’s definitely coming.  But nobody wants to be the guinea pig. If your clients have a crypto stockpile just sitting there driving you bonkers, Abner points to an interesting option: “Instead of selling, [they] may want to hold the asset and use it in a different way.

The G-7 officials described the principles as “an initial articulation” of their views on CBDCs, highlighting the questions that any CBDC project must be able to answer if it is to earn the trust and confidence of its users and the wider international financial community.  While none of the seven member nations has started to develop a retail CBDC yet, the central banks of all of the member countries (the European Central Bank in the case of France, Germany and Italy) have demonstrated their intent to explore implementing one.

At the time of writing, over 7 billion ETH or $25 billion have been sent to this address. This proved one more time that there is a high demand from stakers to access products capable of offering yields on their investments.

The protocol operates with a PoS based layer; a native token called AVT, and a staking mechanism via the Aventus Validator Program. This allows users to have access to fast transactions and rewards for staking their funds in the protocol. We sat down with their team to discuss the relevance of PoS staking for investors, the role that Avanti Network could play in the future of Ethereum, and the potential of its staking program to offer users an accessible and high-quality product.
