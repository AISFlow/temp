42426640,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuobh,1454454351,South Korea's Central Bank Encouraged to Explore Blockchain Tech,"A new report undertaken by the Bank of Korea recommends that the central bank monitor developments in the blockchain space and even undertake its own research into the technology.  Authored by Dong sup Kim of the bank's Payment Systems Research Team, the paper sets out by introducing cryptocurrencies and distributed ledgers before attempting to predict the future for the technology.  Regarding digital currencies, the report does not see these applications of the technology becoming widely used anytime soon.  Citing high price volatility, technical complexity, the risk of hacking or the loss of private keys by end-users, the report predicts:  ""[I]t is not very likely that digital currencies will grow to such level as to replace or pose a serious threat to legal tender or other major payment instruments. ""  However, it struck a more positive tone when discussing the use of distributed ledgers in the financial sector.  Call for cooperation  The report adopts the popular view that blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt the financial market infrastructure and intermediaries, as well as central banking.  ""In particular, its technological innovation should be appreciated, since financial service would be provided in an efficient and safe manner without relying on an institution responsible for the processing the information,"" it reads.  However, the paper suggests that, at present, blockchain technology has various shortcomings that hinder its adoption by financial institutions.  To circumvent the hurdles, the report said, it is ""critical for financial institution, startup companies and government branches to cooperate"".  For the future, the paper recommends that the central bank closely monitors the development of distributed ledger technology by domestic as well as global financial institutions and startups. Furthermore, ""in-depth research shall be conducted, with a focus on the application of distributed ledger technology"".  The document concludes by saying that government and regulator also have their role and, while addressing risks, they should create a ""comprehensive and flexible regulatory system"", so as not to hinder innovation.

42426639,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuodh,1454430952,"Digital Asset Funding Tops $60 Million With IBM, Goldman Sachs Investments","New York-based blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings announced today that Goldman Sachs and IBM have joined its recent funding round, pushing the total amount raised above $60m.  The firm, which as reported earlier this week, is conducting a distributed ledger trial with JPMorgan Chase, has now garnered support from a total of fourteen financial institutions.  Other parties in the round include ABN AMRO; Accenture; ASX Limited; BNP Paribas; Broadridge Financial Solutions; Citi; CME Ventures; Deutsche Börse Group; ICAP; Santander InnoVentures; The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC); and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.  The round marks the second publicly disclosed investment in the bitcoin and blockchain space for Goldman Sachs, which last year took part in bitcoin services provider Circle’s $50m funding round.  Paul Walker, global co-head of technology for Goldman Sachs, said in a statement:  ""We believe that distributed ledger technology will play a transformative role in the way financial institutions transact globally and we look forward to working with Digital Asset and the broader financial and technical community to engage this emerging technology.""  IBM is making its first publicly disclosed investment a company focused on technology, a move that follows months of internal testing and development of proofs-of-concepts. The firm is now playing a leading role in the Open Ledger Project, an open-source initiative that also involves Digital Asset.  ""We are excited to jointly develop distributed ledger technologies that will allow our clients to transform their business, and further strengthen our partnership with Digital Asset,"" said Jerry Cuomo, the IBM Fellow leading the firm’s blockchain efforts, adding:  ""Blockchain holds real potential to transform a wide range of industries and IBM is committed to making it ready for business.""

42426637,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuoVh,1454429841,European Commission Seeks More Customer Data from Bitcoin Services,"The European Commission, the executive arm for the European Union, has said that it plans to tighten reporting standards for digital currency exchanges as part of a broader effort to restrict terrorist financing channels.  The Commission  said that it intends to require both exchange and wallet service providers in Europe to identify their customers, a move that comes after growing debate among EU policymakers about whether digital currencies are being used by terrorist groups to transfer funds.  The announcement comes on the heels of a report by the EU’s top law enforcement agency, Europol, that stated there is no clear evidence tying the technology to terrorist financing efforts.  A notice published today outlined how the Commission intends to regulate exchanges and wallet providers, stating:  ""The Commission is planning to bring virtual currency exchange platforms under the scope of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, in order to help identify the users who trade in virtual currencies. In addition, the Commission will examine the possibility of applying the licensing and supervision rules of the Payment Services Directive (PSD) to virtual currency exchange platforms, as well as virtual 'wallet providers'.""  The effort, the Commission says, is aimed at ""ending the anonymity associated with such exchanges"".  The Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, calls for member-states to tighten reporting and data retention requirements on transactions in the financial system. The Payment Services Directive, issued in 2007, sought to harmonize the rules governing payments in the EU.  The Financial Times reports that a number of the items included in the proposal are being pushed by French President Francois Hollande in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris last November. The Commission is weighing new curbs on prepaid card use, as well as the circulation of high-denomination bank notes.  Notably, the Commission notice touches on the subject of issuing a ban on virtual currencies in the EU. In a section entitled ""Why not just ban virtual currencies?"", the notice explains that while several countries have adopted restrictive policies, no actual ban has yet been instituted, which it attributes to low adoption rates and an acknowledgement of the technology's promise.  ""Virtual currencies are often considered as a useful tool for rapid international payment transfers and low cost money remittances,"" the Commission said. ""To date, virtual currencies represent an innovative but rather small market.""  The announcement comes shortly after the European Union Parliament, the legislative branch of the EU, held a separate hearing to discuss digital currency regulation.

42426632,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuoRh,1454408529,BNY Exec: Lack of Industry Standards Hurting Blockchain Tech,"""To me, network effect is the key.""  So says Saket Sharma, CIO of New York-based financial services firm BNY Mellon's Treasury Services unit, as he outlined the bank’s approach to adopting the technology that underlies bitcoin.  Last week, BNY Mellon hosted a day of seminars focused on the blockchain. The event, which drew a small but engaged crowd of BNY employees, followed months of internal development and experimentation that saw the bank pilot its own digital currency and, later, joining a consortium of financial institutions looking to implement the technology.  In an interview, Sharma argued that collaboration among banks, particularly when it comes to establishing standards of use, will be the driving factor as to whether financial companies begin using blockchains for their services.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I can come up with a solution that’s great, but [it doesn't matter] if I don’t have a network effect – and that’s where I think it’s a combination of the financial industry coming together that will really make this a viable thing if this technology picks up.”  Sharma said that all of the business lines within BNY Mellon are looking at possible blockchain applications, but cautioned that the bank sees regulatory and legal questions as an impediment to adoption.  ""I think there’s a lot of potential with this technology, and our goal is to really capitalize on the talent in the bank, working collaboratively with others, and play a bigger role in the opportunities there,"" he said.  Educational focus  According to Sharma, BNY Mellon began to look into the technology by testing bitcoin and, later, its own kind of digital currency.  ""We started with the bitcoin,"" he said. ""We downloaded Bitcoin Core, we modified it, we actually ran it on an internal private cloud,” he said.  These days, Sharma continued, business units within the bank meet monthly to discuss the results of those blockchain experiments. This, he said, is one product of an effort to establish a culture of experimentation of new technologies within BNY Mellon.  He explained:  ""The question really is, how do we engage the larger BNY community to really start thinking about what is meaningful to us, right? Because to me there are 50,000 use cases but not everything is applicable.""  Sharma added that he has pushed for a more ground-up approach to technology testing within the bank, arguing that collaboration between business units or companies is a better way to approach potential business models compared to a top-down, mandate-driven process.  ""To me, the culture of innovation doesn’t come from five people sitting in a room and saying I know already. I don’t buy that culture,"" he remarked, going on to say:  ""I would rather ignite the process in 50,000 people across an organization.""  Standards push  Sharma went on to reiterate that the bank sees the pursuit of standards for the technology as a key priority as the industry moves toward potential adoption.  This, he said, will enable greater degrees of operability in the event that financial firms operate their own blockchains, pointing to past conversations with startups working in the bitcoin and blockchain space as examples of how the industry hasn’t settled on one solution over another.  ""When [Digital Asset Holdings CEO] Blythe Masters came to us last year, she said we have a technology that's blockchain agnostic. I was surprised. Is it really? I looked at her and said you don’t have a technology. And two weeks down the line they went and bought Hyperledger,"" said Sharma.  Sharma went on to relate a similar experience with bitcoin market data provider TradeBlock. He said that while, during initial conversations, the startup indicated that it used its own proprietary code, the company has since shifted to Ethereum.  ""So the underlying technology itself is so fluid that there’s no stack as a standard, right? So unless you have a standard, you will not be able to interoperate, eventually,"" he continued.  Broad view  Sharma went on to say that the bank’s look at blockchain applications is part of a wider effort to examine how new forms of financial technology.  He suggested that the financial services industry is undergoing a significant period of hype, one that could result in significant change – or simply end up as an unfulfilled promise.  He told CoinDesk:  ""This particular technology is at the peak of the hype cycle at this point in time. When it goes down the slope, you will see real applications coming in. And that’s where the real adoption and the real maturity of it is going to happen.""  For now, he said, the bank is committed to pursuing use standards through the R3CEV-led bank consortium, as well as promoting more in-house experimentation and education, both in terms of distributed ledgers as well as other forms of financial technology.  ""That’s a great opportunity for a bank – and [blockchain technology] is one example,"" he said, adding:  “The idea is to look at all things.”  BNY Mellon Center image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/02/bny-exec-lack-of-industry-standards-hurting-blockchain-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7671e2d2507f329851f62a462d482ed71297bfc-1272x637.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
