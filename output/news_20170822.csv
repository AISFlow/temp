42427720,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL39Rh,1503434093,Exchange Strains Drive Crypto Exchange Kraken to Trim Trading Pairs,"Kraken is removing a number of trading pairs as part of a broader effort to shore up the stability of its cryptocurrency exchange platform.  Citing the need to ""help mitigate the strain on our platform caused by recent exponential growth"", the exchange is removing 11 trading pairs, perhaps most notably the bitcoin-denominated market for the British pound. The goal is to free up capacity on its systems by cutting some of the less voluminous markets, according to a blog post published yesterday.  Other delistings include the pair for ETH/GBP and fiat currency markets for Eos, Stellar Lumens and Gnosis. Further, the exchange indicated that some of the trading pairs may return, noting that this could happen ""once we have ample capacity to do so.""  In addition to the delistings, Kraken is moving to suspend some of the more advanced trading features on its site. Existing order types such as stop losses, take profit limits and trailing stops will be temporarily removed, though active orders will stay open until they are executed. For now, users will only be able to create basic limits and regular market orders until further notice.  Kraken said in a statement:  ""We apologize for the inconvenience to clients but we think that immediate action is needed to help alleviate the current strain on our platform. We may take further action if these changes aren’t enough. Our overall plan is to reduce the load on our current platform until upgrades can be made that will enable us to smoothly scale capacity.""  Signs on social media  suggest that users were largely surprised by the move, triggering concerns about existing deposits as well as broader questions about where to exchange cryptocurrencies for the pound.  Additional changes could be coming to the exchange as it seeks to improve the site's functionality. Accessibility issues have dogged Kraken during moments of significant market activity, and further steps maybe taken ""if these changes aren’t enough,"" according to the blog post.  ""Our overall plan is to reduce the load on our current platform until upgrades can be made that will enable us to smoothly scale capacity,"" the startup wrote.

42427715,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL39Lh,1503429340,Hyperledger Blockchain Consortium Reveals Hybrid 'Sawtooth Ethereum' Tech,"Ethereum developers could soon have another way to build enterprise-grade implementations of the open-source technology.  Revealed today on Hyperledger's website, a proof-of-concept called Sawtooth Ethereum, or ""Seth"" for short, has been completed. The proof-of-concept looks to enable the use of ethereum smart contracts on Hyperledger Sawtooth, Intel's addition to the Linux-led consortium's code.  And while the technological hybrid has technological implications, Brian Behlendorf, the executive director of Hyperledger, chose to describe it more broadly as a success for the consortium itself.  Behlendorf told CoinDesk:  ""[Hyperledger] isn't just a collection of farm animals in one big barn. There really is a point to bringing these communities together and having them work out organically how they might sit on top of one another and be components into a broader architectural vision.""  Other open-source frameworks within Hyperledger include Hyperledger Fabric, contributed by IBM; Hyperledger Iroha, contributed by Soramitsu; and Hyperledger Indy, contributed by the Sovrin Foundation.  Key collaborations  Elsewhere, there's other evidence to suggest Sawtooth Ethereum is proof that Hyperledger is growing organically in the way Behlendorf described.  Hyperledger Sawtooth’s interchangeable consensus mechanism enabled the platform to be more easily integrated with Burrow, Monax’s implementation of the ethereum virtual machine.  Because of this integration, ethereum developers with existing smart contracts are expected to be able to ""transition their work to the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform"" eventually, according to the blog post on the launch.  Monax co-founder, Casey Kuhlman, said in the post:  ""Hyperledger Burrow has long been positioned to provide a core EVM that would then be utilized by other Hyperledger projects. This integration validates that positioning, and establishes a strong upstream-downstream relationship between the Sawtooth and Burrow projects.""

Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that of XRP – the cryptocurrency of the Ripple network – is trading between $0.23 and $0.24. Much of the trading volume, over $1 billion in the last day, has occurred on exchanges that offer Korean won trading pairs.  Bithumb accounts for roughly 44 percent of the global market's activity at press time (reporting more than $500 million in volume), followed by Coinone and Korbit. All told, those exchanges make up just over 70 percent of the past day's total XRP volume.  XRP's price is still below the market high hit in May, when the cryptocurrency's price exceeded $0.33. On the other hand, CoinMarketCap data indicates that the last 24 hours have seen the most volume recorded for XRP in a single day.  Other cryptocurrencies have seen in excess of $1 billion in trading volume, including both bitcoin and bitcoin cash.

Documents obtained by Washington publication The Daily Beast show that the tax agency has been using the startup's software since 2015.  Additional data from the General Services Administration, which handles the US government's logistics, indicates that the IRS has an active contract with Chainalysis that is valid through the beginning of September. To date, the IRS has paid Chainalysis more than $88,000.  The IRS states in the documentation that it's using the software to ""trace the movement of money through the bitcoin economy,"" going on to explain:  ""This is necessary to identify and obtain evidence on individuals using bitcoin to either launder money or conceal income as part of tax fraud or other Federal crimes.""  While it's no secret that US officials are interested in closer oversight of cryptocurrency activities – a group of influential senators pushed for this kind of policy shift in late May – the IRS contract is notable given the tax agency's investigation of potential tax avoiders and its ongoing lawsuit against exchange startup Coinbase.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the IRS wants to obtain several years' worth of data on customers of Coinbase.  The startup has pushed back against the IRS in federal court, ultimately forcing the tax agency to narrow its information request. In recent days, groups like the libertarian think-tank Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Washington-based nonprofit Coin Center have moved to oppose the effort in subsequent filings.

The third iteration of the popular USB stick wallet, the latest model will feature a range of changes on the hardware front, as well as some adjustments to its software, a company blog post said.  Among the most notable physical changes to the device is an increase in length from 40mm to 47mm – a move Coinkite said would help resolve issues some users ran into when plugging in their wallets.  ""The extra length solves an issue we saw with some USB ports that didn't allow proper and complete insertion,"" the post states.

42427721,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL39Nh,1503405009,Boldstart Launches Hyperledger Fabric's First Blockchain Accelerator,"Boldstart Ventures is launching the first accelerator dedicated to startups building on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.  With previous exits that include a $120 million deal with Google, investor Ed Sim today announced Fabric Foundry – a project that finds him emerging as the latest in a line of tenured investors to express confidence in blockchain technology.  But the accelerator can also be seen as part of a more specific and recent trend: As an increasing number of open-source blockchains go online, institutional funds are proving essential to jump-starting development.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Sim positioned the accelerator as a potential pipeline that could feed Fortune 1000 enterprises hoping to capitalize on the increased efficiency of using shared, distributed ledgers.  Sim said:  ""We feel like there's a tremendous amount of corporates working and using Hyperledger Fabric, but there aren't as many startups working in that area. We'd like to bridge the gap.""  Companies selected to participate in the accelerator will spend eight weeks learning how to build with the open-source code and receive an undisclosed sum of money to help them through the build process. Upon completion, startups will be invited to pitch their ideas at an invitation-only demo day.  Still being negotiated are the terms of possible future investments in participants, which Sim said would likely be limited to a ""small amount"" of common stock equity.  Potential for change  With the launch of the fund, Sim adds to a career that has already seen notable highs.  Back in 2010, Sim co-founded Boldstart Ventures with the explicit intention of investing in startups building enterprise-grade technology, especially as relates to corporate infrastructures.  Among Boldstart's exits are New York-based Divide, which was purchased by Google in 2014 for $120 million, and Nova Scotia-based GoInstant, which sold to SalesForce in 2012 for $70 million. Current portfolio companies include blockchain startup Hypr, a tokenized biometric security firm.  But whereas traditional infrastructure platforms have been largely built on proprietary technology, Sim sees a potential for change.  Sim said:  ""The whole idea is, once you go through this process and we get some pilots going, then your likelihood of funding goes up when you have real customers instead of just technology.""  Notable partner  Also revealed is that IBM will serve as an initial partner to Fabric Foundry, providing training and support to accelerator participants.  As such, the general manager of IBM Blockchain, Marie Wieck, told CoinDesk she believes her firm will help accelerate development of the platform – one IBM helped spearhead for the Hyperledger consortium in 2015.  News of the partnership is part of a larger reveal that includes the formation of a new food safety consortium that boasts Walmart, Nestley, Kroger and more as members.  According to Wieck, Sim's experience working with traditional infrastructure companies is a distinguishing trait of the program.  In interview at IBM's Manhattan headquarters, Wieck said:  ""We're providing some support to them, but they are actually driving it with a bunch of other participants.""

42427732,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL39jh,1503403164,"Walmart, Kroger & Nestle Team with IBM Blockchain to Fight Food Poisoning","Several of the world's largest food suppliers are collaborating on a blockchain solution that could one day save both money and lives.  In partnership with IBM, the consortium – which includes Dole, Unilever, Walmart, Golden State Foods, Kroger and Nestle, as well as Tyson Foods, McLane Company and McCormick and Company – today announced its plans to cut down on the time it takes to pinpoint the source of foodborne illness and eradicate it.  But unlike many other blockchain groups that have launched over the years, the consortium is formally launching with a fully integrated enterprise-grade platform, according to Walmart’s vice president of food safety, Frank Yiannas.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Yiannas said.  ""IBM has spent a lot of time coding and creating a real product that you can start using. There's legitimate framework and substance in terms of the product, the technology that's available. It's substantial and real.""  If successful, the project, which will extend Walmart's own custom blockchain proof-of-concept for food safety and traceability to the other partners, stands to cut down on the time it takes to track down dangerous food from weeks to just seconds.  Drawing on multiple IBM pilots in production, the consortium then aims to identify and prioritize different ways that distributed ledger tech can save global food suppliers money via increased traceability of their products.  The resulting efficiencies could not only reduce the revenue lost from unnecessarily pulling of safe food from shelves, but also spur a drop in the number of deaths blamed on toxic food in the first place.  ""We're all in the business of trying to improve the quality of life of people that we serve around the world,"" he said. ""So, on these issues, it's pre-competitive.""  The three costs  But while there's a philanthropic element to the work, the result of delays in identifying dangerous food can also hit deep into a food supplier bottom lines.  During a demo of the enterprise-grade application, IBM's vice-president of blockchain business development, Brigid McDermott, broke down into three categories what she said were the global financial costs of current supply-chain tracking inefficiencies.  The first, which drives the most cost, is the human loss of health and life.  For example, earlier this month, a salmonella outbreak traced back to contaminated papaya fruit was blamed for infecting 173 people, leading to 58 hospitalizations and one death, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report. On average, 420,000 people die each year from food poisoning, according to the World Health Organization.  The second and third costs of supply-chain inefficiencies result from the potential threat to the health of consumers, according to McDermott.  Specifically, she said the cost of recalling a tainted good is typically footed largely by the offending producer. But when identifying the dangerous items can take weeks, prices can drop and people will frequently stop buying the product altogether, resulting in a financial cost to the proprietors of even the safest products.  These losses can be so costly that recent estimates on the total economic impact of foodborne illnesses on the U.S. economy alone have varied between as low as about $4.4 billion per year to as high as $93.2 billion.  McDermott said:  ""A blockchain food safety program is tremendously good because it provides transparency into the food system, which means that in the event that there is a problem like a recall, you're able to quickly, effectively, surgically deal with that problem.""  Teaming up  Long before the consortium had formed, Walmart set out to test the potential benefits of moving the records of some of its most widely consumed projects to a blockchain.  Following what was largely deemed a successful test of tracking pork sales in China and mangos in the U.S., Yiannas realized the limits of being able to identify dangerous food within its own supply chain, if others were still using the traditional system to trace the food to its origin.  While competitors and even other members of the same supply chain took weeks to identify the source of the problem, global prices of the food frequently plummeted, resulting in losses to the entire industry that could sometimes take years to fully recover from.  So, after the early Walmart tests were complete, IBM Blockchain general manager Marie Wieck said she was contacted by the company with a new problem: to help form a collective of industry players, representing more than just different aspects of the supply chain, but potentially competing aspects of the supply chain.  Speaking to CoinDesk at IBM's New York City headquarters, Wieck explained how crucial the wider network is if you want to do more than just identify the source of the problem.  She said:  ""You need the entire industry network to start engaging in order to be able to do both the proof that you can trace back to the farm, but then have the entire supply chain address it.""  Guiding principles  Now that the founding members have been established and the basic technology platform is ready, Yiannas says the consortium is focused on building previously impossible functionality into the blockchain.  Specifically, he hopes the group can implement a higher degree of transparency to accompany the traceability, including whether a shipment was compliant with U.S. Department of Agriculture treatment and whether a food processor was properly certified.  Throughout that process, Yiannas says he expects two main ""guiding principles"" of the development.  First, new standards to make it easier for others to adopt the technology. Second, if there ends up being multiple blockchains managed by the various consortium members, they must be interoperable.  Yiannas concluded:  ""If you're a food safety guy who’s been doing this for 30 years, the power of how much information is at your fingertips is really impressive and exciting.”  Wheat image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Michael del Castillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/08/22/walmart-kroger-nestle-team-with-ibm-blockchain-to-fight-food-poisoning,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af8793347192b3eef3167ab86994c344ddd69b79-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427726,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL39Zh,1503400682,Mark Cuban Backs Former Coinbase Employee's $20 Million Token Fund,"A former employee of bitcoin's best-funded startup is seeking to raise $20 million for a fund that will invest exclusively in cryptographic assets.  Headed by one-time Coinbase product manager and Runa Capital principal, Nick Tomaino, the fund, called 1confirmation and launched officially today, already boasts impressive early backers. This includes celebrity investor Mark Cuban, who went so far as to praise the fund and its mission.  ""I think Nick is one of the sharpest minds in the space, and I'm a big believer that there will be transformational apps built on blockchain,"" Cuban told CoinDesk.  In interview, Tomaino provided more details about the fund's strategy, including its emphasis on moving computer networks from a centralized state to a distributed architecture so as to make them more robust and resilient against attack.  Or, as Tomaino frames it:  ""The most interesting and useful thing about blockchains is their ability to empower people in new ways. Blockchains put power in the hands of people, and take it away from large institutions.""  According to documents reviewed by CoinDesk, 1confirmation will make initial investments in the $100,000 to $500,000 range in SAFTs and SAFEs, legal vehicles designed to help investors pre-purchase tokens or equity prior to an ICO.  1confirmation will then seek to provide support similar to a traditional venture capital firm, including business development, legal and engineering assistence.  Philosophy of decentralization  Tomaino's fund follows a broader trend now underway in the space: early advocates starting funds to invest institutional money to cryptocurrency.  Already, just shy of $2 billion has been invested in token sales, with recent months setting a string of records, according to the CoinDesk ICO Tracker. Yet, institutional investors have acknowledged the high signal-to-noise ratio in the market that makes it difficult to sort out the best ideas.  When asked what specific implementations interesting him the most, Tomaino cited the concept of a ""work token"" – the idea that blockchain tokens can give users the right to contribute to a decentralized organization.  ""I'm looking for projects that use tokens to create new organizational structures and behavioral models,"" he added  When asked for some examples, Tomaino began by framing where he believes the industry is today.  ""The shift right now is around money. So, the biggest example is bitcoin. Fundamentally, what's interesting about bitcoin is the ability to shift the control of money from centralized institutions to people,"" he said.  Toward tomorrow  Tomaino also provided a few examples of where blockchain technology may be heading.  One type of work that seems a likely candidate for tokens, according to Tomaino, is governance functions. ""If token holders can act as governors in organizations they can vote on decisions,"" he said.  Prediction markets, where the work that needs to be done is reporting on the outcomes of events, is another area he believes is ripe for decentralization.  ""To do that in a decentralized way you can't use an API, because then you are just relying on centralization. You need tokens. To create a model where you're not relying on a centralized source of truth makes a lot of sense,"" he said.  Taken in total, the recurring theme Tomaino stressed is that blockchains create new organizational structure – and that by financially backing founders who understand how cryptography, he's enabling a reinvention of the way that individuals interact with each other and the organizations that they are connected to.  In this way, Tomaino sees 1confirmation as transcending the initial coin offering model and its focus on fundraising, concluding:  ""I'm not interested at all in projects that use tokens as a fundraising mechanism.""

Dubbed the B250 Mining Expert, the board was debuted over the weekend by Asus' Republic of Gamers, the Taiwan-based manufacturer's high-end gaming brand.  And while the product's release date and price aren't known yet, it nonetheless represents the latest signal that the mainstream hardware industry is expanding its cryptocurrency footprint. Further, the announcement comes months after Asus began rolling out GPUs designed specifically with crypto-miners in mind – aimed to take full advantage of the digital ""gold rush"" now taking place.  The B250 Mining Expert motherboard itself boasts a total of 19 PCI-Express expansion slots, compared to the 12, eight or six slots featured on competitors' products.  The idea is that cryptocurrency miners – who use computing power (and lots of electricity) to add new transactions to a blockchain, receiving newly minted coins as a reward – want to run as a many graphics cards as possible. The forthcoming board, according to the specs that are circulating, has roughly the capacity of two to three regular-sized motherboards.  The 19 expansion slots are split into three groups, each containing 24 dedicated pins. This allows the mining rig to be connected to three power supply units at once, stabilizing the rig for multi-GPU usage. The board also boasts a variety of features likely to appeal to miners, such as live visual statistics.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, other major GPU makers like Nvidia and AMD have moved in recent months to capitalize on the spike in demand for products that can be used for mining.  Earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang issued bullish statements on the prospects for his firm's entry into the mining space, suggesting that it could be a long-term revenue driver.

Part of a statement in a larger BitPayblog post last week, the words were meant to urge the bitcoin processor's users to upgrade their software ahead of a scheduled code upgrade. It's safe to say, however, that they didn't have the intended effect, setting off a firestorm of angry commentary.  That's because BitPay was indicating support for ""BTC1,"" an alternative software client to Bitcoin Core, the one used by over two-thirds of the network. But the blog post didn't describe the possible consequences of downloading the software. In bitcoin, incompatibility can have economic consequences – namely, the creation of two bitcoin assets, a development that's still splitting sentiment.  Among the angry voices were notable figures in the blockchain tech community.  Lightning Network creator Tadge Dryja called it ""straight up malware,"" while Bitcoin Core contributor John Newbery asserted that the post was ""dishonest and dangerous.""  The accusation is that the advice was put out willfully by BitPay to confuse users – akin to asking users to say, upgrade their iPhone in a way that would make it so they could no longer message other users, or accidentally sign them up for a new carrier.  As such, the criticisms perhaps had more to say about the state of bitcoin's technical roadmap and the lingering idealogical battles ongoing among the network's many different participants.  More broadly, the BTC1 software has emerged as one of the more controversial proposals as it's based on an agreement made up of a group of miners, companies and developers, who, claiming that they represent the interests of network users, intend to hard fork bitcoin to increase the network's block size in November.  And though Segwit2x isn't scheduled to release the hard fork code for several months, the idea is that doing so could potentially lead to the creation of another bitcoin network, one that would compete with bitcoin and bitcoin cash.  That possibility, it seems, has ripped open old wounds.  Culture of infighting  On social media, no slight is too small if it sends a message.  In another notable incident, a developer for Bitcoin Core went so far as to delist Jeff Garzik, the lead developer for BTC1, from the Bitcoin Core GitHub shortly after the BitPay incident.  Although, that this came to pass perhaps isn't surprising. For one, Garzik hasn't contributed to bitcoin since 2014. But the incident does carry a larger symbolism, in that some have labelled Garzik a villain in the ongoing technical battles.  If one of the key charges levied at Segwit2x is that the group, composed of a group of influential bitcoin companies, is trying to ""corporatize"" bitcoin development, it's Garzik that has taken most of the heat.  Critics have so far sought to label Garzik a ""politician"" or else ask (sometimes not politely) that he leave the bitcoin development community entirely. (Garzik was a former employee of BitPay and is now CEO of a startup called Bloq).  Still, Garzik has his defenders, particularly among Segwit2x supporters. Erik Voorhees, whose firm ShapeShift is a signatory, sees the criticisms as reinforcing the idea bitcoin's development team isn't open to change.  Users were keen to disagree – and colorfully.  Danger, danger  Yet another touchpoint in the battle has been the idea of security, with each side spending ample time accusing the other of the willingness to put user money at risk for their ideological beliefs.  Chief among these is the budding fight over ""replay protection.""  The idea is that if Segwit2x chooses to go through with an attempt to hard fork the block size to 2MB, and the blockchain splits in two, replay attacks could lead some users and companies to lose money. And in the mind of advocates for Bitcoin Core, those backing the new agreement should be the ones to add replay protection.  In this way, the event mirrors developments last summer, when a group of developers began working on ethereum classic, the original blockchain abandoned by a majority of users following a hard fork that proved contentious in its community.  And the concerns have merit, as some users lost funds in the resulting shuffle.  Some developers, who have proved willing to work with the Segwit2x group, have even raised concerns as the BTC1 software has not had replay protection put in place. The charge here is, that's been done purposefully.  First and foremost, by not adding replay protection, the Segwit2x group could avoid the appearance of an impending bitcoin split and encourage more users to adopt its software – and that's in line with statements from its members, who have argued BTC1 won't result in the creation of another bitcoin.  Outspoken supporters of a larger block size aren't being shy that they believe this is the right tactic, predicting Core will be the less-popular chain in the end.  Peace and understanding  Yet, there have been attempts to spur more well-meaning dialogue between the two camps.  Ted Rogers, president of bitcoin wallet firm Xapo (which supports the Segwit2x agreement), argued in a mini tweetstorm that critics often misrepresent what Segwit2x members are trying to accomplish.  ""Segwit2x is an honest attempt [at] bringing sides together [with] no split,"" he said, before listing a few of the proposal's benefits.  Rather than argue that Segwit2x is the one true bitcoin, Rogers contends that it will offer the market ""a chance to see how different solutions play out.""  The comments build upon what has been a larger drive by BTC1 supporters to frame the proposal as one supported by a free-market design strategy.  Here, the commentary was divided, if less acrimonious.  In response to Rogers, some bitcoin users responded with a chorus that is likely to only grow louder as November nears, one that stresses the idea that a software upgrade put forward by businesses amounts to a kind of hostile takeover.  Hinting at the heart of the argument, one Twitter user said:    ""If a group of CEOs can simply get together and unilaterally change bitcoin, then that means a government could – and hence bitcoin is dead.""

42427728,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL39dh,1503366914,"Bitcoin Prices Dip Below $4,000 to Hit 7-Day Low","The price of bitcoin is back below $4,000.  Following a period of record highs, average prices across global exchanges declined at the start of trading on August 22, having already dipped more than $150 already from the day's open. At press time, bitcoin was trading at $3,894, its lowest total observed since April 15, when the price hit a low of $3,892.  However, despite the continued show of strength from the market, some traders indicated a belief that bitcoin's rally – which has catapulted the digital asset to 350 percent gains this year – might be reaching its peak.  BTC VIX, organizer of the cryptocurrency trading group Whale Club, remarked that he is losing confidence in the rally. In particular, he cited the fact that bitcoin prices have dipped below $4,000 four times since first surpassing the milestone, a sign he thinks the market isn't keen to push the price higher in the short term.  ""The bulls are tired,"" he told CoinDesk.  Elsewhere, market observers predicted that bitcoin might stabilize around the $4,000 mark.  Such a view was put forth by Mike Kayamori, CEO of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Quoine, who saw the dip below $4,000 as a sign of consolidation, if not a cause for alarm.  Like many analysts, he appears to believe bitcoin is likely to trade in range ahead of possible changes to its underlying technology, though these won't come for some time.  ""[The market] could go lower, but the next big date will be the Segwit2x in November,"" he concluded.
