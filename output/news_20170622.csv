42379539,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88XxH,1498149330,Coinbase Appeals Decision in Cryptsy Collapse Lawsuit,"Coinbase is appealing a court decision from earlier this month in a lawsuit filed on behalf of customers of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Cryptsy.  As CoinDesk previously reported, former customers of Cryptsy have alleged that the exchange and its CEO, Paul Vernon, used Coinbase – which operates a regulated wallet service as well as a digital currency exchange – to launder and steal millions of dollars worth of user funds over a several-year period. Coinbase, those customers argued in a lawsuit filed in December, should have scrutinized the fund movements more closely.  The startup countered that those users were bound by agreements signed by Vernon and Cryptsy, and sought to resolve the dispute in arbitration. On 1st June, US District Judge Kenneth Marra shot down that request, arguing that Cryptsy's customers weren't bound by those terms of services.  Court documents show that, on 13th June, Coinbase asked the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to overturn that decision. A representative for the startup declined to comment when reached.  In an email, attorney David Silver, who represents the plaintiffs, said that he expects the appellate court to uphold the judge's decision.  ""We're confident the 11th Circuit will agree with Judge Marra, and Coinbase will be held accountable for the role it played in the theft and laundering of Cryptsy clients' assets. Coinbase had a fiduciary duty to know its customers and report suspicious transactions,"" he said.  Cryptsy  collapsed in early 2015 following months of growing complaints about fund withdrawals. The site was taken offline amid claims of theft and insolvency, though Vernon has denied that he stole millions of dollars worth of user funds.  A class-action lawsuit against Cryptsy and Vernon was filed within days of the exchange's collapse, though the CEO, who is believed to be in China, has not responded in court to the allegations.

In a budget request for fiscal year 2018, sent on 21st June, Andrew McCabe, acting director of the FBI, testified to the White House that the agency is facing what it believes are significant challenges in gaining access to digital information – even when it has the legal authority to do so. This notably includes cases that involve ""drug traffickers using virtual currencies to obscure their transactions"".  It is also the same narrative that the FBI's former Director James Comey put forth last month before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  The challenge, the agency has said, is that the FBI now requires more financial resources to investigate technologies and decipher information transmitted on the darknet. Elsewhere, it is also engaging in dialogues with companies that provide such technology to educate them on the ""corrosive effects"" that information inaccessibility has on ""public safety and the rule of law"".  Earlier this year  , the privacy-encrypted digital currency Monero (XMR), for example, drew attention from FBI for similar reasons.  A special agent working at the FBI's Cyber Division in New York City said at an event that the agency has concerns such technology will set roadblocks for criminal investigations.  ""Developing alternative technical methods is typically a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process,"" the agency said.

42379540,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88XyX,1498142710,US Government Seeks Blockchain Solutions for Contract Bidding System,"The US government’s main logistical agency is looking at blockchain as a way to re-envision its contract review process.  According to a request for quotation published on 19th June, the General Services Administration is looking for a contractor to help it assess how blockchain could be integrated into FAStlane, a system launched last year as part of a broader effort to streamline how smaller companies, especially IT firms, bid on government contracts. A request for quotation is a kind of solicitation for vendors, specifically for the estimated cost of delivering on a contract.  The agency said on its website:  ""The purpose of this RFQ is to obtain contractor support to develop a proof of concept for DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology), automated machine learning technology, and/or artificial intelligence based exchange implementation into GSA's Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) FAStlane new offer proposal review processes.""  According to supplemental documentation, the GSA would want any blockchain-related implementation ""be cryptocurrency agnostic and not monetize mining"" as well as be capable of supporting smart contracts.  Further, the system should constitute ""a permissioned ledger that uses multiple cloud platforms for redundancy and high-availability and key management"".  The request closely follows statements from a GSA official who told a Washington, DC radio station that the agency is looking into how the technology can enhance the way it provides support to federal agencies.  The new release notably offers insight into at least one of the specific ways in which the agency might apply blockchain – in this case, the process by vendors can gain access to federal contracts. And although it’s a proof-of-concept pitch that might never see the light of day, the request highlights an early use case that is specific to the public sector.  The GSA said that its request is open to bids until 10th July.

42379532,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88XoT,1498135993,IMF's Lagarde Touts Distributed Ledger as Defense Against Terror,"The managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has issued new comments on cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger tech (DLT).  In a speech today at a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) plenary meeting, Christine Lagarde talked broadly about how her organization is seeking to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, noting that blockchain innovations could be both a defense against these issues, as well as a tool that enables them.  ""Of course, fintech is a double-edged sword. It can be used to promote and fund terrorism, including through the anonymity of virtual currencies. But it can also be a powerful tool to strengthen our defenses against the financing of terrorism,"" Lagarde remarked.  Described as the technology that underpins digital currencies, DLT was framed in contrast as a technology that could make the financial system more resilient against attacks, specifically the use of computers to spread fear through cyber-terrorism.  Lagarde told the audience:  ""This technology is less vulnerable to a single point of failure and could prove resilient to cyberattacks because the ledger – or record of transactions – exists in multiple copies.""  Lagarde went on to highlight a new research note the IMF issued this week, in which its researchers discussed topics including central bank-issued digital currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs), among other concepts.

42379535,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88Xpj,1498134609,Identity without the Blockchain? Skepticism Grows for Once-Hot Use Case,"A rising tide of skeptics is arguing that identity might not be the blockchain use case it's often cracked up to be.  For much of 2016 and 2017, the general consensus has been that by distributing a ledger that can validate identifying information, users themselves can determine who accesses their data and what others can see. In theory, those users would own their own identities, as opposed to Facebook, Google, the government, or any number of organizations, all of whom want to keep a record of – and profit from – that data.  But that doesn't mean those seeking solutions are sold on the technology.  To look deeper into question of how to improve the way the world's citizens prove who they are, non-profit ID2020 launched the ID2020 Alliance earlier this week, with founding members including Microsoft and Accenture.  Backed by a $1m donation from Accenture and a $275m donation from the Rockefeller Center, the alliance is seeking new ways to improve identity, regardless of the technology ultimately employed.  And it's entirely possible that blockchain itself may not be that solution, or that there maybe no permanent solution at all, according to ID2020 executive director Dakota Gruener.  In conversation with CoinDesk, though, Gruener elaborated on the importance of ensuring that ""there's a seat at the table for folks who have a blockchain perspective"".  She said:  ""There is a world where there is no technology that can do what we need to do, or it doesn't exist yet. But we still think that bringing everyone together around this communal table is the only way we're going to find something that could work.""  Future members in the ""formal"" effort to move identities away from centralized authorities are expected to include both for-profit and non-profit organizations. The alliance is being modeled after global organisation Gavi, a public-private initiative that provides vaccinations to children.  ""The opportunities to improve the lives of billions of people don't come around every day,"" said Gruener. ""And this is a real opportunity to do something tremendously impactful with technology that's in our hands.""  Business shift  With billions of dollars at stake in the possible transition from centralized identities to decentralized alternatives, the space the alliance will navigate is in all likelihood going to be complicated.  Even so, ID2020 board director Oliver Bussmann thinks the group has the advantage that decentralization will be a ""fundamental design principle"" of all digital identities going forward, regardless of the money being made in the current system.  ""We see in general a change in business model moving in a decentralized direction,"" he told CoinDesk.  The hope is that companies' potential business losses from proving identities in the developed world can be offset by giving more of the 1.5 billion people currently without legal identities access to the economy.  ""It's not that we want these companies selling identity – that's very much not what we're advocating for,"" said Gruener, who added:  ""But if they can then bring a billion new customers in the fold they can build services and what not on top of it and that’s a win for their business.""

42379537,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88XtV,1498129700,Bitcoin Startup Blockchain Raises $40 Million Series B,"Bitcoin wallet software provider Blockchain has raised $40m in Series B funding.  Investors in the round included Digital Currency Group, GV, Lakestar, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Mosaic Venture Partners, Nokota Management, Prudence Holdings and Virgin. Billionaire investor Richard Branson also participated in the round.  The funding is the largest Series B raised so far in 2017, though falling short of the $55m raised by blockchain startup Ripple in 2016.  In statements, the company sought to suggest that the investment may help position blockchain as a leader in Europe's financial technology industry. Blockchain offers a bitcoin wallet service, though it has largely focused on optimizations of this service (eschewing new products).  Still, that hasn't stopped the company from making prestige announcements that showcase its growing influence in the sector. In December, Blockchain added former Barclays executive Antony Jenkins to its board, while former UK Prime Minister David Cameron helped the company open its London office in February.  The news comes on the heels of rumors bitcoin wallet provider, brokerage and exchange service Coinbase is raising a new funding round valued at $1bn following a rise in the price of bitcoin and an uptick in global interest in the technology.

42400067,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzVuR,1498129206,Buddhist Monks Said to Be Targeted by Bitcoin Pyramid Scheme,"A bitcoin-focused pyramid scheme may have targeted Buddhist meditation practitioners in Thailand, according to a local news outlet.  In a report from English-language media source The Nation, members of a Buddhist temple in the town of Uttaradit were said to have been approached with offers to invest in bitcoin. The temple-goers were allegedly promised handsome profits if they invested ""at least 38,000 baht"" (an amount worth roughly $1,100 at press time), including a doubling of that return if they attracted other investors.  A representative of the group filed a report with Thailand's Department of Special Investigation (DSI), prompting the first stages of an investigation over concerns it might be a pyramid scheme, in which early investors are paid out with the proceeds from new ones.  As many as 800 practitioners from Uttaradit, Pathum Thani and Chiang Mai have contributed to the fund, the report said. While no one from the group has confirmed any loss so far, the DSI said the promise was ""too good to be true"" and that it will investigate to ""check whether the operation is illegal"".  The case is not the first possible digital currency-based scam to emerge in Thailand. In 2015, police launched an investigation into a scheme called UFUN that also attracted investors with promises of high returns.

42400064,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzVqV,1498125615,Power to the User: Accenture & Microsoft Are Changing Identity with Ethereum,"Centralized ways of proving identity may soon have an expiration date.  A lofty claim, perhaps, but the idea is arguably bolstered by the launch this week of a functioning blockchain prototype this week built by Microsoft and Accenture. The technology could one day allow users to accumulate verified information about their identity in a profile they control.  Instead of permanently handing over that information to a university, a healthcare provider or a potential employer, the owner of the identity could choose exactly who gets access to what data – and for how long.  The global head of Accenture's capital markets blockchain practice, David Treat, explained in the first live demo of the prototype how any number of identity sources can be aggregated under a single profile.  Speaking on stage at the ID2020 conference hosted earlier this week, Treat explained:  ""We're not moving the data, we're indexing this information. We're putting it into the individual's hands.""  Powered by a private version of the ethereum blockchain, the prototype runs on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform, according to an Accenture statement, and sets out to comply with principles established by the Decentralized Identity Foundation, co-founded by Microsoft.  Under the hood  Instead of reinventing how identity itself is proved, the prototype, developed with assistance from managed service provider Avanade, acts as a cryptographically protected store of data verified by existing identity providers.  While the owner of the identity has ultimate control over the access, once permission is granted to a third party it can be queried for authenticity, and if any part of the information is in doubt, the recipient can ""pull on that thread"", as Treat put it, and go back to the original source.  Yet, when the allotted time expires, any access to the identifying data is permanently revoked, meaning profiles do not ""accumulate"" over time.  The distributed ledger is designed to be maintained by participating parties, while simultaneously preventing personally identifiable information from being viewed by those parties.  Though the demo was conducted using a smartphone user interface, Treat said any number of formats could eventually be employed.  Should the prototype be released to the public, the network of users will likely employ Accenture's Biometric Identity Management System to gain initial access, according to a company statement. The service has already been used in the field by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to enroll 1.3 million refugees in 29 countries.  ""The platform we used allows for the capture of any form of biometric identity, whether that’s voice, or face, or whatever,"" Treat said.  In the year 2020  All in all, the ethereum-based app was built over a six-week period earlier this year in Dublin, Ireland. Created by a team at The Dock, a new research and incubation hub establish by Accenture, the app is still in the early stage of development.  However, Treat emphasized that it does in fact work as intended and shouldn't require years to deploy, as is frequently the time-frame proposed for blockchain projects at this early stage of the technology’s development.  In remarks after the demo, Saadia Madsbjerg, managing director of the Rockefeller Foundation (which helped fund the project), said the group was aiming to have a finalized technical proof-of-concept and multiple pilot projects up and running as soon as 2020.  By that time, Accenture’s Biometric Identity Management System is expected to have increased the number of identities it hosts to 7 million refugees from 75 countries, according to the statement.  Following Madsbjerg’s remarks, Treat concluded:  ""We can do this. We can create an identity that is truly personal, private, portable, resistant, and we are excited to invite everyone to join us.""

HSBC Survey Finds 59% of Consumers Don't Know,"A recent survey suggests that ordinary consumers are still largely in the dark about blockchain.  According to the survey, published in May by UK-based bank HSBC, 59% of consumers polled said they'd never heard of blockchain technology. Furthermore, 80% of those who have heard of the tech said they don't understand what that is.  The results came from a poll conducted during March and April that focused on consumer confidence and understanding in financial technology. The survey involved 2,000 people from the UK, as well as 1,000 consumers in each of the following countries: Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Singapore, the UAE and the US.  The outcome may not be entirely surprising given the current, mostly abstract nature of most blockchain technologies. Data from Google Trends suggests that consumers, however, might be on the road to expanding their knowledge.  The service indicates that the three search terms ""bitcoin"", ""ethereum"" and ""blockchain"" have all seen an increase of search volume, although ""blockchain"" lags behind the two other terms in overall search activity.
