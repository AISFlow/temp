Collins joined the startup in October 2014 as its in-house liaison to US policymakers. At the time, Coinbase said the hiring was part of its broader effort to better inform US lawmakers on the technology.  In a email obtained by CoinDesk, Collins indicated that he will move on to a role at BAFT, the international subsidiary of the American Bankers Association, to serve as vice president of international policy.  Collins wrote:  ""It's been a fantastic opportunity working with each of you on some of the more interesting and timely issues in tech and finance today.""  Prior to his time at Coinbase, Collins had worked as a senior advisor to the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, which has held congressional hearings on digital currency.  Coinbase did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether it would seek to fill the vacated position.

Issued last week and widely regurgitated in the media, Hearn’s declaration that the bitcoin project had “failed” drew massive, and mostly negative, attention, due to its implications for an important and long-standing industry debate.  As a result, it wasn’t long before theories emerged suggesting that the post and its media placement may have been encouraged by his new firm R3CEV, the secretive startup working to build distributed ledger technology with 40-plus banks and for which Hearn serves as chief platform officer.  In his latest Medium post, Hearn took aim at these assertions, noting that his work with R3 had already been announced and stating his belief that bitcoin and his new firm are not in competition.  Hearn wrote:  ""R3 is not a bitcoin company, or even a cryptocurrency company, and there is no 'BankCoin' or 'R3Coin'. So this is really nothing to do with them and conspiracy theories are just a waste of time when there are more serious issues to consider.""  Included were statements from R3 co-founder Todd McDonald in which he emphasized his belief that both projects can coexist, comments echoed by Hearn.  ""Bitcoin competes with some things banks do but a big part of banking is about lending and trading, and those activities would still occur even in a world where bitcoin was the one global currency. It’s not a zero-sum game, banks and bitcoin co-exist and R3’s fate is independent of Bitcoin's,"" he wrote.  The statements are a step removed from Hearn’s comments in his original post, in which he wrote that the bitcoin network was ""on the brink of technical collapse"" due to the lack of consensus on how to scale the network.

42378555,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iZw9,1453144376,LHV Bank: We Support Bitcoin's Values,"Though the industry has recently seen new attention from brand-name financial giants, one of the earliest institutions to embrace bitcoin and the blockchain was Estonia’s LHV Bank.  Since 2014, LHV Bank has been working to study use cases for the emerging technology, striking partnerships with startups like Coinfloor and providing banking services to Coinbase. In June of last year, LHV even went so far as to launch its Cuber Wallet app, a blockchain-based wallet that allowed users to send digital representations of real euros.  In 2016, LHV says it is set to expand its experimentations, indicating its ambitions are now bigger than ""creating yet another wallet"". In a new interview, LHV’s cryptocurrency product manager Jüri Laur expanded on the state of his firm’s current projects and evolving industry theses.  Laur told CoinDesk that LHV remains interested in both digital currency and distributed ledger applications for the technology:  ""It's fair to say we support the core values of bitcoin - namely decentralization and open permissionless innovation. That being said, we are a bank and have to operate within a certain legal framework and take all regulations very seriously which limits our choices at times.""  The firm's openness to digital currency use cases notably comes at a time when industry investors are betting less on startups with this focus, and simultaneously, major financial firms are openly disparaging the idea currency applications for the technology have merit.  Still, Laur suggested his firm isn't sold on the ideas of its peer institutions.  ""I believe permissioned blockchains are suitable for certain use cases, but also lose a lot of the key qualities that make the technology so valuable,"" he added.  For his part, Laur says LHV is keeping its trials ""blockchain agnostic"", so that it would be able to adapt should an alternative blockchain become more widely used.  He noted, for example, that he is bullish on Ethereum and that LHV hosted its creator, Vitalik Buterin, during a recent visit to Estonia.  Bank-wide initiative  As for the size and scope of LHV’s internal initiatives, Laur said the bank has yet to build a separate department, but he noted that the company is taking active measures to ensure its employees are well-versed on the emerging technology.  ""'Cryptocurrencies 101' is a part of onboarding training for all new staff. I'm fairly certain no other bank does that today,"" Laur boasted.  Laur further addressed LHV’s stance on the trend among major financial firms to form consortia aimed exploring use cases for distributed ledger applications of blockchain tech.  Owing to LHV’s early interest in the industry, he said LHV has so far stayed out of these headline-grabbing partnerships, and that it believes its actions have been beneficial.  ""I believe one gets a much better understanding of the technology and it's potential by building its own proofs-of-concept,"" he said.  Laur added LHV would not ""rule out"" joining any consortia in the future, though it did not name any specifically it may consider.  Down the 'rabbit hole'  As for his own acumen with the technology, Laur said he first learned about bitcoin in 2010, but only last year began to see its potential.  A former billing and payments manager for Skype, Laur took over managing LHV’s cryptocurrency product in October.  Speaking to this background, Laur suggested that he understands why Internet companies like Netflix have voiced support for bitcoin. The payment systems used today, Laur says, ""simply aren’t built"" for online business.  ""The challenge for the likes of Skype is to be able to provide a means to pay in almost every country in the world. And there isn't a single payment method that can do that today,"" he said, adding:  ""Could bitcoin or another cryptocurrency solve this problem? Potentially yes.""  Laur went on to call existing banking infrastructure ""ancient"".  The statements echo a trend recently emphasized by Aite Group, which found blockchain to be gaining steam among financial firms due in part to a drive to replace legacy systems.  Expanding trials  Though Laur did not hint at any new POCs in development at LHV, he called the firm’s Cuber Wallet, a partnership with bitcoin firm ChromaWay, a ""success"" that the bank is eager to build on.  Laur said LHV is working to prepare the technology for commercial use, a process that may include expanding its API as it seeks develop the product for more use cases.  ""Today we are live with the wallet product for our own account holders, but do aim to expand both our customer and product range this year,"" he said.  Laur went on to call its Cuber wallet foundational, but hinted at broader goals ahead, concluding:  ""To keep it simple, my main goal for 2016 is to start solving real-life problems.""

42378541,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iZdH,1453131596,Russian Investigator Latest to Support Proposed Bitcoin Ban,"The chairman of Russia's Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, has said ""money substitutes"" including bitcoin should be banned before they reach widespread use in the country.  Speaking with Rossiyskaya Gazeta last week, Bastrykin warned of the lack of central control and relative anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The latter, he indicated, is a motive for various crimes, including drug and arms trafficking, terrorist financing and tax evasion.  Citing data from the Prosecutor General's Office, Bastrykin said illegal payments in ""virtual currencies"" had helped supply the banned terrorist organization LIH with Russian oil and gas, and aided recruitment of new members.  He went on to say that ""concerned agencies"" in cooperation with the Investigative Committee proposed to ""criminalise the production and trafficking of money substitutes"" that are not legal means of payment.  The official further expressed concerns that mass adoption of money substitutes could eventually threaten the ruble's status as the national currency of Russia.  While money substitutes currently comprise less than 1% of GDP, Bastrykin said, if they should grow to exceed 10% it would cause the ruble to be displaced.  He added:  ""As a result, the state may lose the monopoly on the issue of money and the income from this activity.""  History of threats  Bastrykin's comments are the latest in a series of threats to digital currencies from Russian officials and lawmakers that have stifled the fledgling bitcoin industry in the country.  At the end of 2015, it was announced that lawmakers had submitted a new draft bill to the Duma, Russia's Parliament, that would effectively ban the use of digital currencies domestically.  The text of the draft included language that would issue a range of fines for the issue and exchange of ""money surrogates"", a definition under which digital currencies would likely fall, should it be passed, though legal experts are seeking to dispute this claim.  Founded in 2010, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation was established to succeed the Investigative Committee of Prosecutor General's Office and answers to the president directly. The agency investigates criminal offenses and is responsible for inspecting police forces and law enforcement misconduct.  Article based on an informal translation from Russian.

42378530,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXaD,1453115075,5 Big Questions for Bitcoin in 2016,"There have already been dozens of 2016 prediction lists emanating from the broader bitcoin and blockchain community over the past several weeks, so I'll avoid contributing to the cacophony. After the abysmal results with my personal predictions for 2014–2015, I've finally learned to ask more questions and offer fewer forecasts, anyway.  Instead of prognosticating, I'll offer 10 simple questions for the bitcoin and blockchain industry going into this year.  Next week, I'll address the broader blockchain ecosystem. This week, I've got five questions for bitcoin in 2016:  1. How will scalability be solved?  The growth in bitcoin transaction volumes shows no sign of abating, and yet the 1MB block data limit is no closer to being raised than it was six months ago. Whether and how it is raised (via hard fork or changes to Bitcoin Core) will have lasting repercussions, and changing one of bitcoin's fundamental rules will have unintended, unpredicted and perhaps negative consequences.  One of bitcoin's earliest contributors has now written off bitcoin as a failed experiment.  So it helps to remember that the important question this year is not necessarily how bitcoin is scaled, but whether it is allowed to scale without a dogfight.  There are currently only four ways to scale bitcoin today: via lightning networks, via sidechains, via off-blockchain transactions batched by third parties (eg: Coinbase), or by increasing the block-size.  Lightning networks and sidechains aren't yet ready for prime time, and most technologists would agree that increasing the clout of third-party transaction processors goes against bitcoin's intended design. No offense to the segregated witness enthusiasts, but that doesn’t sound like a true scaling solution either – more like an optimization.  This means that by mid-2016, we'll either see a stop-gap resolution to increase the block-size, a hard fork, or a spike in bitcoin transaction fees for smaller transactions. All have their associated risks.  So here’s my question: will the Bitcoin Core block-size limit increase or remain at 1MB?  2. Will reward halving affect price?  Assuming that cooler heads prevail with the block-size debate, and a consensus on scalability is reached before the technology and its network fractures (a big assumption, to be sure), it will be fun to watch what happens to the bitcoin price and mining incentives over the next several months.  For the second time since bitcoin was released into the wild, the bitcoin mining reward subsidy is scheduled to halve – around July 2016, from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC per block. Other things equal, this should result in some combination of smaller miners dropping out of the market, a rally in the bitcoin price, the curbing of mining difficulty increases, and greater interest from miners in allowing bitcoin transaction fees to rise.  Economics aside, the broader community would benefit the most from a rally in the bitcoin price, as the higher market cap would lead to additional liquidity, tighter trading spreads and lower volatility.  But has the halving been priced in during this three-month, 80% price rally?  3. Will bitcoin platforms attract developers?  Every tech company is building a ""platform"" when they are speaking with investors, but there simply aren't many true platforms in bitcoin. I'd argue that there are currently only two nascent bitcoin platforms worth watching in 2016: Coinbase and 21 Inc.  (Both happen to be the industry's investor darlings, so maybe there's something to this whole platform thing.)  Of the two, 21 probably has the edge given the company is 'fiat-free' and won't risk jeopardizing its business if a third-party app developer misuses the product.  21 needn't worry about what its users do with the virgin coins they mine on their devices: 21 isn't even transacting in bitcoin, they're merely selling the hardware to create new bitcoins. Brilliant for keeping regulatory costs – both tangible (legal fees) and intangible (employee headache) – down to near zero.  The Coinbase compliance team, on the other hand, is on the hook if apps built using Coinbase's 'wallet-as-a-service' promote money laundering or illegal money transmission.  That said, 21 may have to worry about the economics of its mining chips.  By CEO Balaji Srinivasan's own admission: ""Crucial to [the success of bitcoin as a fundamental system resource] is the idea that bitcoin generated by embedded mining is more convenient — and hence more valuable — than bitcoin bought at market price and manually moved over to the site of utility.""  Early returns on these chips suggest that users would have to consider the marginal convenience of acquiring bitcoin via on-device mining worthy of a ~10x (or greater) premium versus simply creating and funding a wallet.  Building on Coinbase might be risky and expensive from a compliance perspective. Building on 21 might be just downright expensive.  4. Will we see a killer app?  Let's go one step beyond questioning whether there are any viable bitcoin platforms and ask simply whether there are any interesting applications.  The industry's worst kept secret is that bitcoin remains a terrible currency for those with access to only basic financial services.  Credit cards offer better consumer protections, rewards, and user experience than bitcoin for nearly all purchases except for those in outright illicit or gray market industries like gambling and marijuana.  For nearly all other developed economy use cases other than speculation, superior non-bitcoin applications exist: Venmo for peer-to-peer payments, TransferWise for (some) international currency exchange, etc.  Unless an application leverages functionality unique to bitcoin (multi-sig for escrow, nLockTime for metered payments), I'm skeptical it will ever prove to be an interesting bitcoin application.  If the killer consumer application has so far proven elusive, will 2016 be any different?  5. Will we see autonomous transactions?  The viability of micropayments as a killer bitcoin app has proven to be questionable at best over the past seven years.  There's the issue of ""mental accounting barriers"" which were highlighted by cryptographer Nick Szabo as far back as 1996 – do we have the mental capacity to truly pay attention to the difference between $0.05 and $0.10 in a single payment?  There's the chicken-and-egg issue of whether it is even worthwhile for content platforms to spend time and energy accepting and supporting bitcoin payments when the community of active wallet-holders is still somewhere in the mere hundred thousands globally. (Remember how little even the most savvy promoters made from their bitcoin paywalls?)  And then, of course, there's the block-size issue, which, unresolved, would render micro-payments uneconomical for consumers anyway.  Yet some of these critical issues seem to fade away when it comes to smart device transactions.  For one thing, mental accounting isn't very difficult for computers. And using a digital currency like bitcoin for micropayments as a method for verifying the identity of a connected device or for metering machine-to-machine transactions is more natural.  Embedding chips into sensors, phones, and other everyday smart devices at scale could also obviate the need for consumers to explicitly opt-in to using bitcoin, while simultaneously resolve the demand issue: with the right supplier relationships, it costs less to on-board a new device 'customer' than a new human customer.
