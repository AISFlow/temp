According to a GitHub submission from an IOTA developer Sunday night UTC, a bug in the node software created a ""corrupt ledger state.""      ""There is an edge case where IRI [IOTA Reference Implementation] didn't account for a transaction that was shared between two distinct bundles. Once it marked it as 'counted' in one bundle, it was ignored for the next bundle,"" the GitHub post reads.      Users first reported the problem on Sunday, which took IOTA's engineering team some 15 hours to fix. IOTA founder David Sønstebø said the bug was ""minor"" and ""it's really no different from periods where the network has been spammed and thus real tx [transactions] slowed down significantly"".      IOTA has asked users running IRI nodes to update to a new software version that patches the bug.      IOTA's co-founder Dominik Schiener said in an email the issue originated with the ""current primary mainnet node software"" and had nothing to do with the Coordinator, a special node that's operated by the Foundation, which is responsible for the final confirmation of transactions on IOTA's decentralized network, known as the Tangle.      The team has already started to replace it with a new lightweight node, known as Hornet, and said it plans to remove the Coordinator once engineers have fully tested and resolved any possible network problems with an event known as the ""Coordicide.""      Following reports on the bug in the network on Sunday, Sønstebø defended the current set-up, arguing this was ""precisely why Coordicide takes time, one can't execute it until all possible kinks have been ironed out.""      Nonetheless, critics have already argued the centralized nature of Tangle curtails performance and makes it vulnerable.      In 2018, blockchain researcher Joseph Rebstock told The Next Web the Coordinator automatically approves the same hash, meaning hackers could steal cryptocurrency from users who reused wallet addresses by repeating transaction data. Sønstebø later denied this was a vulnerability.      In an email Monday, Schiener wrote: ""Coordicide is proceeding unchanged, with the first alpha test happening in January.""      The IOTA Foundation designed Tangle as a transaction platform for new internet of things (IoT) initiatives. The Taiwanese capital of Taipei partnered with IOTA in early 2018 to test a new tamper-proof citizen identification system.

42383111,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uASx,1577702394,"Thanks to Better UX, This Year Dapps Will Go Mainstream","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Jason Goldberg is founder of OST, which powers the ethereum application layer, and Pepo, an app where people share videos for tokens.      As recently as a year ago, even the most ardent blockchain proponents had to concede the user experience was too clunky for any app using cryptocurrency to make it in the mainstream. After all, who could imagine users accustomed to smooth on-boarding and participation on apps like Instagram, tolerating having to write down 12 words to secure a wallet or operate a second browser window or another app to ""sign"" transactions. Can you imagine asking Instagram users to make sure they have enough ETH in their ‘Insta-wallets’ to pay gas on each transaction?      Thankfully, 2019 will be remembered for technical innovations that enabled dapps to start to feel like apps. The foundation is laid, and blockchain is finally ready for primetime. 2020 will be the year we begin to see mainstream adoption of crypto-powered apps.      It’s all about solving real problems for real people. Until now, crypto has sometimes felt like an elegant solution in search of a problem – a blueprint for a far-out, visionary utopia. While thinking big is admirable, new technologies must first identify real problems and offer solutions people can use. Most people don't wake up in the morning thinking in bold strokes about decentralized finance; they worry about how they’re going to pay the bills, live, learn, experience, and laugh. It’s these people and use cases that crypto must, and will, address.      The failure so far of crypto projects to gain broad-based user adoption comes down to the fact that, until now, the tech and the user experience have not been ready. But, quietly, developers and founders have been building the infrastructure layers for crypto apps to break out.      This parallels previous technology cycles, to which I’ve had a front-row seat. I started at AOL in the late-1990s before founding a series a “web 2” companies. It usually takes a few years for technology to catch up to vision. YouTube would have been impossible in 1997 because broadband didn’t exist. Social media could not have taken off in 2000 because there weren’t enough people online to create robust connections, and the smartphone was not yet invented. In each of these cases, technology, user experience and adoption needed to reach a certain inflection point before a new vision could really catch fire.      Blockchain is now at exactly this type of inflection point, turning the corner from an exciting concept into real-world solutions for millions of people. Ironically, it’s when people are most disillusioned that builders break through, and that’s what happened in crypto in 2019. The builders and makers have prepared the infrastructure. Now the tech is ready to offer products that genuinely address a need – making life easier, better or just more fun for people.      A year ago, many projects would have run aground because crypto couldn't deliver a seamless user experience. Onerous requirements around account recovery, transaction signing and gas payments limited adoption to the “crypto-native.” But this year has seen technical breakthroughs that finally make crypto capable of delivering the user experience necessary to appeal to a broad audience. Smart contract wallets give users self-custody of their assets without requiring them to write down 12 words and store them on a piece of paper. Now all they need to initiate account recovery is a six-digit pin. An account that cannot be recovered is no better than one where money has actually been stolen, so this is a huge improvement in account security. Plus, the improved user experience brings crypto into line with something as mainstream as an ATM.    For the first time, we can offer dapps with beautiful, blazing-fast UX.    User experience is further strengthened through meta-transactions, which can be programmed to remove the need for users to pay for gas each time they move tokens. Multi-signature, or “multisig,” contracts have led to innovations such as session keys, which remove the need for users to sign every transaction. These two breakthroughs combine to make the experience of using an Ethereum-based app far smoother. With the crypto machinery running silently and smoothly in the background, for the first time we can offer dapps with beautiful, blazing-fast UX.      Platforms such as Gnosis and Argent are now leveraging these capabilities to deliver tangible benefits to users across a range of use cases, including digital ID, finance and custody.      Following three years of working deep in the infrastructure layer of the Ethereum stack, I’ve spent the past year building out Pepo, an Ethereum-based dapp that feels just like an app. In Pepo, every tap of the “like” button transfers a token – giving a whole new meaning and value to likes. Suddenly, content creators can be instantly rewarded by their fans and earn real money for their creations, without any middlemen. Social networks such as Facebook may have popularized the concept of “likes.” But only a blockchain-powered app can add cryptocurrency, decentralize peer-to-peer payments, and monetize the experience with its capacity of micro-transactions.      Crypto serves a clear additive purpose for apps like Pepo. Providing content creators with tokens instead of just “likes” establishes a clearer rewards structure within the app, It is also designed to serve a curating function, as users are less likely to send tokens to creators of content that doesn’t truly appeal to them. Pepo was approved by Apple for in-app purchases and cash-out options, a precedent that is essential for the mainstream adoption of crypto-powered apps.      Other projects will come to market in 2020 showing how crypto can power a new generation of technical solutions. Particular areas to watch are direct-to-consumer retail, the sharing economy, media platforms, multiplayer games, influencer marketing, and asset management. The crypto apps that launch in 2020 will show that tokens can have real utility; that there are use-cases where crypto really does offer the best possible solution; and that we can create a superb user experience that is made better, not just bearable, by blockchain technology. That’s why 2020 will be the year crypto finally breaks out.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jason Goldberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/30/thanks-to-better-ux-this-year-dapps-will-go-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77d8f025a413098505fc829574a6800987bd874f-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383106,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uALP,1577701061,AI for Everyone: Super-Smart Systems That Reward Data Creators,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Ben Goertzel is founder and CEO of SingularityNET, a blockchain-based AI marketplace project.      As AI rapidly pervades every sector of the economy, there are few questions more urgent than who owns, controls and guides the data used to train AI systems, and the models and conclusions AI learns from this data.      Right now the answer tends to be large corporations. Data about our thoughts, preferences, fears and desires, as revealed in our emails, messages, photos and documents, are stored in corporate repositories and used to create personalized ads driving our purchasing behaviors. Data about our bodies and our genomes are stored in pharma company databases and used for proprietary R&D, without our explicit consent and without us receiving any reward for therapies discovered. These large corporations, of course, are operating in close coordination with government surveillance agencies, sometimes to protect the civilian population and sometimes more nefariously.      As AI gets more and more intelligent, the question of who owns and controls it will become even more acute. It’s fortunate, therefore, that technologies exist to enable careful tracking and control of AI's usage of personal data, models and conclusions, and abilities learned based on peoples’ data. This may be in the end the most critical application of blockchain technology, and associated methods like homomorphic encryption and multiparty computation, which allow sophisticated AI data processing to occur while still respecting data privacy.    As AI gets more and more intelligent, the question of who owns and controls it will become even more acute.    During the last two years, the importance of combining AI and blockchain has become almost commonplace at conferences, workshops and startups. There is not yet a decentralized AI network with wide commercial adoption, but the concept has become broadly accepted. By the end of 2020, it seems likely there will be exciting use cases involving companies large and small getting their AI services from API calls into a decentralized, blockchain-based network instead of via a centralized AI service.      Over the same timeframe, AI systems have been increasing in power to a remarkable degree, with more high-profile business applications across multiple vertical markets, along with fundamental research progress making the leap from application-specific “narrow AI” systems toward the more general-purpose AI systems long foreseen by sci-fi authors and futurist pundits.      Not long ago Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) was a subject of discussion only in certain rarefied research circles. But since Microsoft's $1 billion investment into OpenAI, one now hears the term from the mouths of national and corporate leaders. It is now fairly broadly understood AI needs to go beyond mimicking its training datasets and achieve the ability to handle new domains its programmers and trainers did not anticipate. While human-level AGI systems remain for the future, we are taking steps in that direction with AI systems that can carry out causal inference (identifying the root causes underlying complex events like stock market crashes or disease outbreaks) and doing analogy reasoning (using knowledge about, say, mouse disease to help understand human disease, or knowledge about Chinese to help us understand English).      The fusion of AGI and decentralized AI, however, has not yet hit the public radar in a big way. In 2020, we will likely see the first concrete steps in this direction. That will awaken public attention to the potential of decentralized frameworks to work toward AI with capability for profound imagination, generalization and creative learning.    Practical forms    AGI-oriented agents in a decentralized AI meta-network (involving multiple interoperating decentralized AI networks: let's say SingularityNET, Ocean, Fetch.ai, Shivom and dozens of others, all working together) will be able to provide abstraction and generalization services to application-oriented AI agents running in this same meta-network.      Suppose a healthtech-oriented AI agent needs to make a hypothesis about which ones of the 25,000 or so human genes are involved in causing prostate cancer. But suppose it only has DNA data from a few hundred people – not enough to allow it to draw solid conclusions about so many different genes. Without a framework allowing this AI agent to consult other AI agents for help, the AI would probably just give up. But in a context like SingularityNET, where AIs can consult other AIs for assistance, there may be subtle routes to success. If there are other datasets regarding disorders similar to prostate cancer in model organisms such as mice, we may see progress on understanding which genes are involved in prostate cancer, via the combination of multiple AI agents, with different capabilities cooperating together.      Suppose AI #1 – let’s call it the Analogy Master – has a talent for analogy reasoning. This is the sort of reasoning that maps knowledge about one situation into a different sort of situation – for instance, using knowledge about warfare to derive conclusions about business. The Analogy Master might be able to use genetic data about mice with conditions similar to prostate cancer to draw indirect conclusions about human prostate cancer.    We will see work toward more general forms of AI that are owned and guided by individuals    Then suppose AI #2 – let’s call it the Data Connector – is good at finding biological and medical datasets relevant to a certain problem, and preparing these datasets for AI analysis. And then suppose AI #3 – let’s call it the Disease Analyst – is expert at using machine learning for understanding the root causes of human diseases.      The Disease Analyst, when it’s tasked with the problem of finding human genes related to prostate cancer, may then decide it needs some lateral thinking to help it make a conceptual leap and solve the problem. It asks the Analogy Master, or many different AIs, for help.      The Analogy Master may not know anything about cancer biology, though it’s good at making conceptual leaps using reasoning by analogy. So to help the Disease Analyst with its problem, it may need to fill its knowledge base with some relevant data, for example about cancer in mice. The Data Connector then comes to the rescue, feeding the Analogy Master with the data about mouse cancer it needs to drive its creative brainstorming, supporting the Disease Analyst to solve its problem.      All this cooperation between AI agents can happen behind the scenes from a user perspective. The research lab asking the Disease Analyst for help with genetic analysis of prostate cancer never needs to know that the Disease Analyst did its job by asking the Analogy Master and Data Connector for help. Furthermore, the Analogy Master and Data Connector don’t necessarily need to see the Disease Analyst’s proprietary data, because using multiparty computation or homomorphic encryption, AI analytics can take place on an encrypted version of a dataset without violating data privacy (in this case, patient privacy).      With advances in AI technology and cloud-based IT, this sort of cooperation between multiple AIs is just now becoming feasible. Of course, such cooperation can happen in a manner controlled by large corporations behind firewalls. But what’s more interesting is how naturally this paradigm for achieving increasingly powerful and general AI could align with decentralized modalities of control.      What if the three AI agents in this example scenario are owned by different parties? What if the data about human prostate cancer utilized by the Disease Analyst are owned and controlled by the individuals with prostate cancer, from whom the data have been collected? This is not the way the medical establishment works right now. But at least we can say, on a technological level, there is no reason AI-driven medical discovery needs to be monolithic and centralized. A decentralized approach, in which intelligence is achieved via multiple agents with multiple owners acting on securely encrypted data, is technologically feasible now, by combining modern AI with blockchain infrastructure.      Centralization of AI data analytics and decision-making, in medicine as in other areas, is prevalent at this point due to political and industry structure reasons and inertia, rather than because it’s the only way to make the tech work.      In this case, the original healthtech-oriented AI tasked with understanding the genetic causes of cancer would do well to connect behind-the-scenes with this analogy-reasoning AI, and with a provider of relevant model organism data to feed to the analogy reasoner, to get its help in solving its task.      In the Artificial General Intelligence network of the near future, the intelligence will exist on two different levels – the individual AI agents, and the coherent and coordinated activity of the network of AI agents (the combination of three AI agents in the above example; and combinations of larger numbers of more diverse AI agents in more complex cases). The ability to generalize and abstract will also exist, to some degree, on both of these levels. It will exist in individual AI agents like the Analogy Master in the example above, which are oriented toward general intelligence rather than toward solving highly specialized problems. It will exist in the overall network, including a combination of generalization-oriented AI agents like the Analogy Master and special purpose AI agents like the Disease Analyst and “connector” AI agents like the Data Connector above.      The scalable rollout and broad adoption of decentralized AI networks is still near the beginning, and there are many subtleties to be encountered and solved in the coming years. After all, what the decentralized AI community needs to achieve its medium-term goals is more fundamentally complex than the IT systems that Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM, Tencent or Baidu have created. These systems are the result of decades of engineering work by tens of thousands of brilliant engineers.      The decentralized AI community is not going to hire more engineers than these companies have. But then, Linux Foundation never hired as many engineers as Microsoft or Apple, and it now has the #1 operating system underlying both the server-side internet and the mobile and IoT ecosystems. If the blockchain-AI world's attempt to catalyze the emergence of general intelligence via the cooperative activity of numerous AI agents with varying levels of abstraction is to succeed, it will have to be via community activity. This community activity will need to be self-organized to a large degree. But the tokenomic models underlying many decentralized AI projects are precisely configured to encourage this self-organization, via providing token incentives to AI agents that serve to stimulate and guide the intelligence of the overall network as well as working toward their individual goals.      Large centralized corporations bring tremendous resources to the table. However, for many applications – including medicine and advertising – it is not corporations, but individuals, who bring the data to the table. And AIs need data to learn. As blockchain-based AI applications emerge, large corporations may find their unique power being pulled out from under them.      Would you rather own a piece of medical therapies discovered using your medical records and genomic data? Would you rather know exactly how the content of your messages and your web-surfing patterns are being used to decide what products to recommend to you? Me, too.      2020 will be the year this vision starts to get some traction behind it. We will see the start of real user adoption for platforms that bring blockchain and AI together. We will see work toward more general forms of AI that are owned and guided by the individuals feeding the AI with the data they need to learn and grow.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | AGX,Ben Goertzel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/30/ai-for-everyone-super-smart-systems-that-reward-data-creators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d3976fa3e8bc6597f54302f85ec44de5fe5deb0-1200x710.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383099,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uACb,1577698200,Korea's Tax Agency to Withhold $70M From Crypto Exchange Bithumb,"South Korea's National Tax Service (NTS) will withhold tax worth 80.3 billion won, or $70 million, from the country's largest crypto exchange Bithumb.      CoinDesk Korea reported Sunday that Vidente, the largest shareholder of Bithumb Holdings, which runs Bithumb Korea, confirmed the withheld amount in a notice and said the tax will be imposed on its foreign customers. However, that may not actually happen.      This is the first time the country's taxation agency has imposed tax on gains from cryptocurrency transactions, the report said.      “Bithumb Korea is planning to take legal action against the tax claim so the final payment can be adjusted in the future,” the notice said, according to a report by Korea JoongAng Daily on Monday.      The amount of tax was calculated based on the rate for miscellaneous income, i.e. irregular income like lottery gains, Korea Joongang Daily wrote. The tax is collected at an annualized rate of 22 percent, based on the amount of foreign withdrawals from Bithumb.      It's unclear what consequences the action will have for Bithumb's clients or the exchange itself. Bithumb hasn't commented on the situation by press time. According to the report, while the tax office’s first target is foreign customers trading cryptocurrency on the Bithumb exchange, withholding tax is paid to the government by the party that pays money in a transaction, in this case Bithumb, rather than the customers.      “Bithumb can pay 80.3 billion won and [theoretically] afterwards collect the amount from its foreign clients, but practically it’s impossible,"" Kim Woo-cheol, a University of Seoul professor of taxation, said in the report.      Korea Joongang Daily cites an anonymous source at the exchange explaining that although the Korean government banned foreigners from opening accounts on crypto exchanges in December 2017, they still used the country's trading platforms.      “So were transactions using fake names. Even for the exchanges, it’s difficult to know who the investors actually are and how much their trading profits are. It’s questionable what the taxation was based on,"" the source said.      Korea's Income Tax Act currently does not recognize cryptocurrency transactions as taxable events and there are no clear rules about taxing crypto in the country at this point.      Earlier in December, the country's Ministry of Economy and Finance said it would introduce specific regulations for taxing crypto in the coming year. In another step towards regulating the industry, Korea's central bank published a report saying it will hire experts to study distributed ledgers, cryptocurrencies and CBDCs (central bank-backed cryptocurrencies).      In 2018, South Korea banned anonymous crypto trading. According to the Special Financial Transactions Information Act, which is under works in the country's National Assembly, crypto exchanges will have to register with the Financial Services Commission (FSC), and failure to do so can result in punishment up to five years in prison.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/30/koreas-tax-agency-to-withhold-70m-from-crypto-exchange-bithumb,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f6edd17792e6fc247c6110c055e55517cc97d5d-1500x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Dec. 27 in a press release, the Indonesian wing of Huobi Group looks to facilitate cryptocurrency trading in Southeast Asia’s largest economyhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html.    According to the firm, Huobi Indonesia boasts 50,000 registered users, of which approximately 10 percent are active in daily trading. Approximately $374,000 was transacted in the most recent available daily data.      With this play, the Jakarta-based firm hopes to gain market dominance in Indonesia, said Xiong Dan, Huobi Indonesia CEO, in the announcement. Crypto exchanges Coinmama, LocalBitcoins, and Luno are frequently cited avenues for purchasing bitcoin in Indonesia.      Huobi's gateway allows users to swap Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) for tether (USDT), which can then be traded on the local exchange. Huobi Cloud, a collection of approximately five international partners, will provide liquidity for the gateway.      “The new fiat gateway is part of Huobi’s global expansion strategy and reflects our ongoing commitment to working with strong local partners in key markets across the globe,” said David Chen, senior director of Huobi Cloud, in a statement.
