42378893,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mM8j,1476393252,"Blockchain Could Reshape Finance Admin, UK Risk Assessors Say","A risk assessment agency within the UK government recently published comments on blockchain technology.  Primarily an overview, the publication by the Government Actuary's Department is the latest to emerge from within the UK government, which has seen a number of offices give their perspective on the technology.  Various offices within the UK government have begun a variety of initiatives focused on blockchain, including efforts to fund projects as part of its broader commitment to technological innovation. Earlier this summer, the UK agency in charge of its welfare programs initiated a trial that uses a blockchain to track payments, drawing scrutiny from some privacy advocated after it was announced.  For their part, the Department of Actuaries notes that, if adopted, the technology could help reinvent the way financial services manage themselves.  The article's author writes:  “In sum: blockchain and its competitors have the promise to revolutionise the currently expensive, inflexible, and slow administrative systems used in financial services.”  It goes on to suggest that broader adoption could take place, so long as relevant regulatory concerns are addressed. At the same time, the department notice cites recent actions by the Financial Conduct Authority as positive in this respect.  Should these barriers be reduced, financial services could reap the benefits of reduced cost and operational complexity.  “There remain a number of significant obstacles in the way of progress but in the coming years we may see the financial services industry becoming more streamlined and efficient if these ‘fintech’ revolutionaries successfully navigate them,” the note concludes.

42378902,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mMDl,1476378619,UN Considers Blockchain in Search for Sustainability Solutions,"Blockchain is set to be discussed at a United Nations (UN) meeting on sustainable development today.  According to a UN agenda, the meeting in New York will focus on how private-public partnerships could use blockchain (among other tools) to achieve sustainable development goals. The event is being organized by the diplomatic missions from Bangladesh and El Salvador, along with the World Organization of Governance and Competitiveness and New Jersey-based Saint Peter's University.  The UN’s 16th Sustainable Development Goal focuses on a variety of areas related to inclusion, transparent government and fair justice systems. Specific calls to action include the goal to ""provide legal identity for all, including birth registration [by 2030]"", ""develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels"" and ""substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms"".  While notable, the idea that blockchain technology could yield new solutions in finance and beyond has slowly gained traction within the UN for much of the past year.  Last month, a research outfit funded by the UN disclosed that it was working on a number of blockchain initiatives, and the UN's agency focused on aid for impoverished children has also begun moving to fund related projects.  What specific use cases today's meeting will cover aren’t immediately apparent, though blockchain has long been seen as an enabler of change in governance and identity.  Organizers for the event were not immediately available for comment.

42378889,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mM4x,1476375024,Could Bitcoin Be the Future of Blockchain Post Trade?,"Conventional thinking about blockchain technology's use in stock markets may be wrong, according to one academic.  The argument was put forward by Professor David Yermack, chairman of the finance department at New York University, this week at Imperial College London's first FinTech-focused academic conference.  There, Yermack presented an unpublished report that argues blockchains will evolve differently in capital markets than widely expected. For example, according to Yermack, functions such as stock settlements will one day be carried out on public blockchains like bitcoin, as opposed to private or premissioned alternatives.  Overall, Yermack, who teaches a cryptocurrency course at NYU’s Stern School of Business, offered a much broader vision for the use of blockchain in finance than what the industry is considering, as well as more critical takes on how incumbents are exploring the tech.  Taking a dig at DTCC, for instance, Yermack said its report ""Embracing Disruption"" did little to show or illustrate how blockchain could change the current state of affairs.  Agents of change  That's not to say that Yermack didn't take a measured view of public blockchains.  On the contrary, Yermak acknowledged the limitations of bitcoin's throughput and its proof-of-work consensus system today, but noted that it's something he believes the industry will need to work out better solutions for.  Still, he insisted that the future of finance will be brought about by a real decentralized blockchains that don’t have monopolies that guard access to stocks, bonds and currencies.  Speaking of the direction where the disruption will come from, Yermack sees three potential players. These include challengers (complete outsiders looking for disruption); collaborators (like the DTCC and R3); and regulators (countries like the UK, Australia, and Canada).    Overall, he believes that the challengers were the most likely to succeed, but that some regulators (like those in the UK) are better positioned to bring about change than others.    Quick wins  Interestingly, Yermack believes one of the easiest and quickest ways for the industry to move to a blockchain model is by exploring use cases in corporate elections by shareholders, an avenue already being pursued by Nasdaq.  Yermack said shareholder voting on corporate elections is currently inefficient when it comes to vote counting, and that the voting results are often plus or minus 5% of what they should be.  Further, in the current model, there are many challenges when it comes to corporate elections, he said. There are various different ledgers of ownership, maintained by the company, the broker, and the market in general, which gives rise to different voting results.  Broadridge, which has what he called ""a monopoly that is very inefficient"" administers corporate elections voting, is also interested in blockchains.  But, Yermack went beyond words, showing that corporate elections are prone to favor management proposals. Such issues, he believes, could be eliminated with the help of blockchain-based voting systems.

42378897,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mMBF,1476371907,Blockchain Stock Market Startup Funderbeam Raises $2.6 Million,"A startup headquartered in London that uses blockchain tech to power a next-generation stock market has raised $2.6m in new venture funding.  Thomson Reuters, Draper Associates and IQ Capital were among those that invested in the funding round for Funderbeam. Existing stakeholders, including 3TS Capital Partners and a group of angel investors, also took part in the round.  The startup is pursuing a use case that has seen broad interest worldwide, both among new market entrants as well as major established players like Nasdaq and the Australian Securities Exchange. Millions of dollars in venture capital and in-house funding have thus far been deployed in a bid to create new mechanisms for the exchange of stocks.  Kaidi Ruusalepp, Funderbeam’s founder and CEO, has experience in this field, working for two years as chief executive for Nasdaq OMX’s outfit in Tallinn, Estonia. She later sat on the service’s management board between 2007 and 2011.  Ruusalepp said in a statement:  “Funderbeam is the future of exchanges, combining three things in one: data, funding & trading, and it’s all happening across borders and on blockchain technology.”  Platform users purchase tokens tied to the startups they choose to invest in, which can later be traded in an on-site order book. Thus far, Funderbeam’s marketplace has been used as a vehicle for three startups (including itself) to raise funds.

42378901,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mMF1,1476367631,Ripple CEO Calls for Next President to Appoint FinTech Advisor,"With less than a month to go before the US election, one distributed ledger startup's chief executive is making the pitch for a national 'FinTech advisor'.  Chris Larsen, CEO of Ripple, is calling for the next US president to appoint an advisor to help navigate the rapidly changing financial technology sector. In a new blog post, released today, Larsen argues that technology is redrawing the boundaries of finance – and that the US government needs to take action to keep American companies competitive.  His words of caution come weeks before Americans head to the polls on 8th November, an election that will likely see Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump taking the top public office.  Larsen wrote:  ""If we are to stay on top economically, if we are to find a way to close the gap of economic inequality, this is the key. New technologies like blockchain will be a catalyst to increase financial inclusion and lower the barriers to commerce.""  Thus far, only Clinton has weighed in on the subject of blockchain, indicating support for some form of national policy in a campaign statement published in June. To date, Trump's campaign has declined to discuss the tech when reached.  Easing conditions for startups  Larsen argued that such a forward stance on policy would help ease even the geographical challenges facing US-based business today. The distance between Washington DC, New York and Silicon Valley, he said, put those headquartered in major cities at a disadvantage.  He reasoned that the appointment of a FinTech advisor to the White House could help educate an otherwise uninformed president about new technologies.  ""It's a lot of the way Washington works,"" he said. ""You get new things in the world and new things fall through the cracks. An advisor can be a bridge until a new institution is created.""  Larsen went on to say that a FinTech advisor to the president could help ease concerns in another key area: regulation.  He wrote:  ""In their eagerness to protect American consumers, regulators can unintentionally paralyze positive innovation. Our next president must have reliable expert advice to temper that instinct, and to seize this magic moment.""

42378944,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mMIn,1476361532,Polish Parliament Holds Public Consultation on Cryptocurrency,"The Sejm – the lower chamber of the Polish Parliament – has held the country's first public consultation devoted solely to digital currency and blockchain tech.  Organized by the Polish Bitcoin Association (along with MP Mirosław Suchoń and the government's ""From Paper to Digital Poland"" program), the event attracted about 70 people, including academics, public officials, industry representatives, legal experts and economists earlier this month.  Part of an ongoing effort to drive Poland's engagement with digital currency and blockchain technology, the event provided evidence domestic agencies are increasingly interested in the technology.  Alongside the event, a working paper was released that called for the Ministry of Finance to issue an interpretation on cryptocurrency taxation (for example, deciding whether to align with the UK tax body's guidelines from March 2014) and create a regulatory sandbox for startups.  During the meeting, the National Centre for Research and Development announced that it has received a grant proposal to co-fund the creation of a Polish blockchain technology accelerator. Additionally, several presentations illustrated how blockchain-based solutions could solve problems within Polish public institutions.  The meeting took place just a few months after the Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs recognized blockchain technology's role in the digitization of public services.  Further, in June, the Polish government launched a program that aimed to ""find regulatory, legal and economic solutions"" that will make it possible for digital currency projects to compete in the European nation.  Video of the meeting is available at iTV Sejm and bitcoinet.pl.  Krzysztof Piech contributed reporting.

42378863,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJQ9,1476358405,SEC Seeks Additional Comment on Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking additional public feedback as it weighs whether to approve a bid to launch a bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) by investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.  The decision to open up the process to more comment comes after the SEC said it was delaying its final decision on a request to list the ETF on the BATS Global Exchange. The Winklevoss brothers originally sought to list the ETF on the Nasdaq exchange, a request that dates back to 2013.  For now, the SEC says it wants feedback on the stability of bitcoin, the manner in which the trust will value the holdings, and any potential conflicts of interest between the custodian and bitcoin exchange Gemini, which is owned by the Winklevoss brothers.  SEC deputy secretary Robert Erret wrote in document:  ""The Commission requests that interested persons provide written submissions of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the issues identified above, as well as any other concerns they may have with the proposal.""  Commentators have 21 days from the publication of the SEC document in the Federal Register to formally enter their submissions. Rebuttals can be filed 35 days from that time, the agency said.
