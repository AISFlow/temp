42375714,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwABVD,1639438286,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin, Ether Tumble Ahead of Federal Reserve Meeting","(Edited by James Rubin)  Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin fell as investor jitters grew over the upcoming Fed decision on combating inflation.  Technician’s take: A breakdown in BTC could damage the intermediate-term trend despite oversold signals.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $46,963 -6.7%  Ether (ETH): $3,800 -8.75%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,668 -0.9%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: $35,650 -0.8%  Nasdaq: $15,413 -1.3%  Gold: $1,786 0.2%  Market moves  Bitcoin fell by more than 7% on Monday, the biggest daily percentage drop since Dec. 4, as stocks in the U.S. also declined ahead of a Federal Reserve monetary policy decision later this week.  The Fed is expected to release its decision on Wednesday on whether it will move faster to wind down its bond purchases and signal it will start raising interest rates next year.  While a low interest rate environment has sent both stock and crypto markets skyrocketing this year, a rate hike and ending easy-money policies more quickly could, however, turn the market in a bearish direction.  Ether also fell sharply on Monday, despite the fact that the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization previously proved it was more resilient to macro headwinds than bitcoin. At the time of publication, ether was down by about 10% at one point in the past 24 hours.  The ether-to-bitcoin price chart, an indicator of bitcoin’s dominance relative to ether, dropped accordingly, after reaching its highest level since 2018.  According to crypto trading data firm Kaiko, the ether-to-bitcoin ratio chart has historically served as a gauge for investor sentiment.  “When the ratio increases, it suggests investors are rotating funds into ethereum and altcoin [alternative cryptocurrencies] markets, and vice versa,” Kaiko wrote in its newsletter on Monday. “Since the end of October, the ratio has been on a steady upward trend and recently topped its highest level since 2018.”  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Drifts Lower, Risks Testing $40K Support  Bitcoin (BTC) remains under pressure as buyers failed to break above $50,000 over the past week.  The cryptocurrency is down about 6% over the past 24 hours and was trading around $47,300 at the time of publication.  Immediate support is seen at the 200-day moving average (around $46,700), which is also the bottom of a weeklong price range. Given negative momentum signals, however, bitcoin is at risk of breaking below support, which could damage the intermediate-term trend.  For now, the relative strength index (RSI) is the most oversold since May, which could encourage short-term buying. Still, upside appears to be limited toward the $50,000 resistance level.  If a breakdown occurs, the next level of support is seen around $40,000, which could stabilize the decline.

42375707,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwABNf,1639434435,Crypto Miners Extend Slump as Bitcoin Price Falls to Lowest Point Since October,"Shares of crypto miners, who are the most exposed to the price of bitcoin, continued their slump on Monday as bitcoin’s price fell near $46,000, close to where it was in the beginning of October.  Almost all crypto miners’ stocks were in the red for the day, with Bitfarms falling more than 9%, while shares of peers Argo Blockchain and Cipher Mining fell by more than 7%. Shares of other miners, including Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain, Hive Blockchain and Hut 8 Mining, also fell more than 4% on Monday.  Read more: Bitcoin Drifts Lower, Risks Testing $40K Support  Shares of one of the largest bitcoin miners, Marathon Digital, have fallen about 51% since reaching this year’s peak on Nov. 9. At that time, the bitcoin miner’s market capitalization was around $7.6 billion, according to TradingView data. It fell to nearly $3.8 billion on Dec. 13, an almost 50% shedding of value.  Meanwhile, bitcoin miner Greenidge Generation was the only miner that outperformed its peers on Monday, its shares rising about 1.4%. But Greenidge recently experienced its own sharp decline after U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) expressed concern about the miner’s environmental footprint.  However, because of the correlation of miners’ stock price to the underlying cryptocurrencies they mine, some of their shares are still positive for the year to date, as bitcoin is up about 59% and ether has advanced 414% so far this year.  Amid the continued slump, some analysts are remaining positive in their outlook for the miners. In a December research note, DA Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler wrote that the stocks of the miners represent a “materially better” buying opportunity than bitcoin itself as there should be more upside for the miners when bitcoin’s price recovers.  Brendler also noted that the pullback in bitcoin should help slow the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate recovery while the miners are still “super profitable” with the price of bitcoin near $50,000.  Earlier on Monday, JPMorgan initiated research on bitcoin miner Iris Energy, which the bank’s analysts said is a “a cheap way to play the digital gold rush.” JPMorgan cited the “deep discount” for Iris shares versus other crypto miners.

42390137,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUtbjz,1639431937,How the Economics of Bitcoin and Ethereum Shape Their Cultures,"Cryptocurrencies are cryptocultures. These cultures express themselves through different means, but the primary form of cultural expression is economics. Each blockchain represents an experiment in economics and the implied society this economics will create.  The most famous and well-known experiment is bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto introduces bitcoin with the term “electronic cash.” Originally, bitcoin is presented as a complete money that has both cash-like properties and, as a consequence of its consensus mechanism, gold-like properties. Bitcoin will act in parallel as a medium of exchange and a store of value.  This article is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment.  Nakamoto displayed cypherpunk and libertarian instincts. Cash-like properties in a digital money secures privacy – in theory, at least – and gold-like properties ensure scarcity. Implied in diminishing block reward returns is a maximum supply of 21 million bitcoins.  The cash narrative has had mixed fortunes. Many users did not use Bitcoin as intended and opted to use centralized exchanges as their wallets, undermining privacy. The appreciating price of bitcoin also ensured nobody would spend them on coffee. We see flickers of bitcoin as cash in places like El Salvador, but arguably at the price of contradiction, as non-state money becomes state money.  Another cultural sticking point is that it is a monetary network with a monetary policy that cannot be altered. That there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins has fostered a subtle belief in what I call monetary minimalism.  Monetary minimalism places the governance of money in a decentralized software system and minimizes human interference beyond the upkeep of the system.  In order to introduce a monetary policy change, like raising the maximum supply of bitcoins, it would be necessary for the majority of stakeholders to adopt the new consensus rules. It is conceivable bitcoin culture evolves in such a way, but right now such a radical alteration of the monetary policy is highly unlikely. Since bitcoin users are attracted to it precisely as an alternative to the managed monies of the fiat currency system, this situation would mean bitcoin had ceased to be bitcoin, as originally intended.  Ethereum’s economics are an interesting contrast to bitcoin’s monetary minimalism. It is important to state, especially in today’s needlessly adversarial environment, that Ethereum is not primarily concerned with economics. Rather, Ethereum is first and foremost a distributed world computer with its own native currency. However, it can be imagined as a kind of home for the vast token economy built on top of it: DAOs, DeFi, NFTs (or decentralized autonomous organizations, decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens, respectively).  Ethereum’s native token, ether or ETH, is framed in the white paper in quite pragmatic terms. It has a “dual purpose.” The first is to act as a “liquidity layer to allow for efficient exchange between various types of digital assets.” The second is that small amounts called “gas” are required when making transactions or deploying and using smart contracts.  Ether is framed as functional and comes across more like money in the contemporary understanding. Its productive use enables the expansion of economic activities.  Since the Ethereum project is not primarily money-oriented, we find ether discussed more as a tool to be managed. Ether does not have a maximum supply – it is not designed as libertarian’s store-of-value – but issuance has been decreased at times and a mechanism for burning ETH (EIP-1599) has some deflationary effects.  In these cases, the native currency has been managed in order to address current technical problems or to prepare for long-term improvements, such as the transition to The Merge (an upcoming upgrade that will shift Ethereum to a new consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake). This is a form of monetary minarchism.  Monetary minarchism allows limited management of a world computer’s native currency in order to improve the world computer.  The competing economic visions offered here are, I claim, temporal ones.  Bitcoin, as writer Lana Swartz puts it, is a ”theory of society” involving the collapse of the fiat system and bitcoin as the beneficiary of that collapse. Bitcoin is presented as a hedge against what the community sees as inherent contradictions of fiat currencies. It is, in this narrative, an inevitability.  See also: You Can Be a Bitcoin Maximalist and Like Ethereum, Too | Opinion  However, the contemporary bitcoin community does not suggest this as an immediate concern, but an event on the horizon. The task of the bitcoin user is therefore to forego now – save, accumulate, don’t spend – in order to benefit later (inverting the time-preference theory).  Following accumulative strategy, the stereotypical “hodler” may appear to outsiders as almost evangelical and his emphasis on saving, ascetic. But with rising interests rates it is arguable that the deflationary alternative of bitcoin may become more and more attractive to the general public.  The economics of Ethereum have a more immediate attraction. Because Ethereum is the meta-economy housing smaller sub-economies (DAOs, DeFi, NFTs) it offers a different escape route from economic stagnation. Ether has the characteristics of a productive asset where interesting work (DAOs), attractive interest rates (DeFi) and scarce digital assets (NFTs) can be discovered.  This productive stance – the stereotypical “degen” – can appear to outsiders as almost reckless and the emphasis on spending irresponsible, but with a stagnating economy it is arguable that the productive alternative of Ethereum may become more and more attractive to the general public.  Monetary minimalism and minarchism are distinct, but we would do well to remember both are on the same side, standing opposite to the fiat monetary system.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Paul J.

On Friday, NFT collectibles and fashion startup RTFKT announced on Twitter that the company had been acquired by Nike. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.  The acquisition appears to be a perfect fit. One of RTFKT’s flagship products is a hybrid NFT/physical shoe collectible inspired by the legendary CryptoPunks NFT collection, and the project attracted headlines in March when a digital footwear collaboration with prolific non-fungible token artist FEWOCiOUS sold $3.1 million in metaverse kicks.

Market participants expect the central bank to accelerate the pace of asset purchases, which could cause some investors to reduce their exposure to speculative assets including equities and cryptocurrencies.  Tighter monetary policy remains a cyclical headwind that “may continue to dominate performance in the weeks ahead,” crypto exchange Coinbase wrote in a newsletter to institutional clients. The exchange also mentioned that “investors should be prudent about their level of risk exposure.”  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $46,366, -7.79%  Ether (ETH): $3,728, -10.09%  S&P 500: $4,668, -0.91%  Gold: $1,786, +0.21%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.41%  From a technical perspective, bitcoin’s price appears vulnerable to a breakdown if current support levels fail to hold up.  “A significant short-term indicator for the market promises to be the 200-day average for bitcoin,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “An ability to bounce back above that line would indicate bullish sentiment prevails and promises new attempts to climb above $50K or $60K this month. A sharp fall would formally clear the way for a deeper correction to $41K or even $30K,” Kuptsikevich wrote.  Crypto fund inflows slow  Digital asset investment products saw inflows drop 52% last week to $88 million as crypto markets saw a downturn.  The inflows into crypto funds during the week ended Dec. 10 compared with $184 million the prior week, according to a report Monday from CoinShares.  Funds focused on bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, accounted for the bulk of the week’s inflows at $52 million, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported. The prior week, bitcoin-focused funds saw $145 million of inflows. Meanwhile, SOL, the token of the blockchain-based smart contracts platform, saw inflows of $17 million. SOL is down 35% on the month after reaching an all-time high in November.  Altcoin roundup  SUSHI jumps 10%: Sushi tokens jumped as much as 10% in early European hours to over $6.19 from a low of $5.30 on Sunday night, data from market tool CoinGecko shows. Prices retraced slightly afterwards as some traders took profits. The move came shortly after Daniele Sestagalli, a top application developer on base layer (layer 1) blockchain Avalanche, proposed joining the platform in a post on the project’s governance forum, CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa reported.  Tezos ‘Exchange-Traded Cryptocurrency’ launches on German exchange: Digital asset manager ETC Group has launched an institutional-grade tezos exchange-traded exchange-traded product (ETP) on Europe’s Deutsche Börse XETRA under the ticker symbol EXTZ.

42394335,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc8E9,1639426362,The Infuriating Patchwork of Crypto Regulations Is Good for Crypto,"Like many others, I view last week’s House Financial Services Committee hearing at which six crypto CEOs explained the industry to Congress as a watershed moment for the industry in the United States.  The dialogue was collegial and constructive, and felt grounded in a genuine desire to speak with each other rather than past each other. The discourse dispelled a number of myths, including the mistaken belief that crypto is currently unregulated. It felt like a major step forward for everyone.  This is why I’m concerned about recent calls for a single, centralized regulator for the crypto industry, which feeds the false narrative that crypto is unregulated and therefore in need of a new overseer.  As we seek to build on the encouraging momentum established by the recent hearing, it’s important to carefully weigh the trade-offs associated with this idea.  Current crypto rules are messy. It’s been called a patchwork and fragmented. You might even say it’s decentralized. It’s certainly not perfect. But it has allowed the crypto industry to emerge, grow and mature. The role New York state (my former employer) took to regulate the space is an example of this. As such, it’s worth considering the trade-offs associated with moving from the chaotic system we have today toward a more single, autocratic regulator.  A few points are worth considering:  First, as a practical matter, it would take a very long time to transition to a single regulator. Legislation would likely be required. Then, regulators would need to write rules and hear public comments. Staff would need to be hired. Only then would the heavy lifting of rearchitecting the organizational structure of our regulatory system likely begin, a process that could take many years. Given the pace at which crypto is moving, putting any type of pause on things to do this would be a setback for U.S. competitiveness.  Second, and more strategically, today’s system optimizes for optionality and flexibility rather than certainty and efficiency. This is the right trade-off for a nascent industry in the early stages of its development. It’s not easy navigating the many different federal and state regulators, but there is benefit to the madness. It provides fertile ground for experimentation and testing.  Third, a single centralized regulator is akin to being “judge, jury and executioner.” As a former regulator, I know how easy it can be to get things wrong, especially when it comes to new and emerging business models and technology. Putting all of the regulatory authority and power in one place is risky for everyone, consumers and industry alike. While there may be certain benefits to large incumbents, this would not be good for the ecosystem as a whole.  See also: Money at the Speed of Thought: How ‘Fast Money’ Will Shape the Future  Finally, today’s multi-regulatory landscape has important benefits for consumers. It allows for multiple cops on the beat, producing healthy and protective regulatory redundancy. If one regulator or law enforcement agency misses or overlooks a problem in the market, there’s a better chance someone else will catch it. The system today enables state regulators to pursue regulatory approaches best tailored to the local populations they serve.  Some people make the mistake of assuming regulators are more independent and impartial than they actually are. If this year – even the past week – has shown us anything, it should be a realization that priorities and emphasis can shift, sometimes dramatically, with a change in administration and senior leadership. The multi-regulator system reduces the shocks from this risk.  For an industry that values decentralization, the benefits of avoiding a single point of failure should be apparent.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Matthew Homer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/13/the-infuriating-patchwork-of-crypto-regulations-is-good-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2b4b7614c975756b90e0d144c6c8927d1a84bda-2400x1547.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here&apos;s what it may mean for the price of the crypto. Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Nears A New ATH According to on-chain data, the BTC network hashrate seems to be approaching the ATH it set back in April of this year. The &apos;hashrate&apos; is an indicator that shows the total amount of computing power connected to the Bitcoin blockchain network. On the BTC blockchain, miners compete with each other by solving complex algorithms so that they can handle transactions. For this purpose, miners require a high amount of computing power. Thus, a high amount of hashrate means there is a lot of power present on the Bitcoin network, which can help the chain perform faster and more efficiently Also, high values of the indicator may also imply that there are a lot of nodes (that is, miners) connected to the network. Therefore, such values can lead to better decentralization of the BTC network. This helps make the blockchain more secure against any possible attacks. On the other hand, if a crypto network has low hashrate, the chain may show poor performance, and it might also have worse security.

Like many of the artists now intimately involved with NFTs, Alcindor – better known as the mononymous rapper Latashá – began the year without much of an interest in crypto. She’d already found a kind of underground success in her native Brooklyn, with a series of independent albums and singles released over the the past few years.  Music had been a side hustle before she started making real money from it; stints at companies like Urban Outfitters and JPMorgan helped pay the bills. “I was doing three shows a week, while also working my nine-to-five,” she said. Sustained collaborations with two prominent New York performance spaces, National Sawdust and The Shed, helped raise her profile, but the songs themselves were never her primary source of income.  This interview is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment. It was published first in The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It was Alcindor’s partner, the artist Jahmel Reynolds, who got her hooked on non-fungible tokens back in February.  “It was right during the [coronavirus] pandemic, we were both trying to figure out supplemental income,” she explained. “Couldn’t really perform, couldn’t really do anything. And then Jah came to me one day and was like, ‘Yo, you ever heard of this thing?’”  Alcindor said she didn’t pay much attention until Reynolds started to generate income from his NFTs. It was a sign of a clear momentum at a moment when cash was scarce – and money has a way of melting away some of that initial skepticism. She minted her first token (tied to one of her music videos) on a protocol called Zora, and one of the site’s co-founders snapped it up for $1000.  “Since then,” quipped Alcindor, “I was hitting the ground running.”  Zora hired her as the company’s head of community programming in June, and she’s been promoting the brand ever since. At this year’s Art Basel, in Miami, Alcindor hosted Zoratopia IRL – a day-long event focused around the intersection of culture and crypto, with an emphasis on Black NFT creators.  NFTs remain relatively inaccessible, thanks to crypto’s technical barrier to entry (interacting with these systems is exceedingly complicated) and consistently high fees. Putting art on the blockchain is far more expensive than just uploading it to Instagram.  The way Alcindor sees it, the potential benefits are well worth the price of entry; you won’t find music videos selling for thousands of dollars on Instagram.  “We’re trying to encourage marginalized communities to come on board,” she said. “It’s beautiful to see people see other people’s stories and be like, ‘I could do that too.’”  Get the whole of Crypto 2022: Culture Week here.  Our conversation, condensed and edited for clarity, is below.  What’s excited you most about the relationship between music and NFTs? And what projects have you been exploring in that niche?  The thing that caught my eye the most about music and NFTs was the agency that it gave back to artists. I have been trying to stay away from labels for years, because independence was my goal. And I’ve also just seen a lot of label deals be terrible. When I got into music and NFTs I realized, oh, I can have full agency and full authority of all my choices and what I’m getting paid for. So, platforms like Zora, like Catalog, I’m even looking into sound.xyz right now.  No major labels seem to have really cracked NFTs yet, even if they’ve tried – do you think that’s something we’ll see in the near future?  The system is a mess, and the system is rigged. I’m not gonna even sugarcoat it for you. The system that major labels are running with right now is wrecked and problematic and needs to completely shift in order for them to work within NFTs. I really don’t believe that major labels will do well with an NFT, because this thing is literally made for autonomy, for sovereignty, for artists to figure out how to, like, do this on their own. It’s so direct to artists and consumers that I don’t see the possibilities of major labels really being able to hold it, unless they create a whole new system around it.  I just feel like artists are not going to be here for the [garbage]. I’ve even had some talks with major artists, and they are working on leaving their labels right now, because of the surge that NFTs are showing. But the tables always turn – that’s how it is. We just gotta make sure that while we’re setting these trends and rules with NFTs, we do them the right way. And that’s my work every day.  Is there anything you’re skeptical about, in this space? It’s easy to get starry-eyed very quickly.  My only skepticism is just overall with NFTs, making sure that culture and that communities of different diasporas are taken focus on. Crypto is still very white, tech, male. And a lot of the abundance is going to that group, and not so much to the marginalized communities. And I’m really hoping and pushing for collectors to be focusing more on other groups and faces and places. So let’s not act like this is la-la land, we’re still dealing with racism, we’re still dealing with classism, and all the things. But I think if we could nip it in the bud early and quickly through NFTs right now, I think we’re gonna see a big transformation and change in the economy and the gaps that we’re dealing with.  Do you think that culture is starting to change at all?  I hope. I don’t know. I do believe that a lot of people are doing the work to do the changes.  You’ve spoken in the past about hostility in the NFT community, specifically at NFT.NYC. Was that whole week a negative experience?  The whole experience wasn’t negative because we decided to transform the experience in itself. Honestly, I felt kind of shunned from the actual NFT.NYC conference. But I just created my own experiences. When we went there, a lot of the events had invited me but I couldn’t get in, or me and my homies couldn’t get in. And then at one event, I performed, and they cut my set after one song. The music director said I was too aggressive and loud so they cut my set, and then they cut all the hip-hop sets after me.  It just goes to show you what we deal with in certain spaces. After that, though, we just made a decision to create our own spaces that really could equate to our safety and what we need. So I ended up creating Zoratopia IRL at Art Basel off of that experience at NFT.NYC.  What was it like to host your own event in Miami after that experience?  It was just such a dope feeling to see what we’ve been growing online now find a new place to be, and feel full and at their greatest selves. And I was just so full of gratitude to have created this event, because I just wanted to see us have a place where we could speak and celebrate and do all the things. And Zoratopia really became that for me, and I’m really excited to see that continue. Hopefully I can get to tour it next year, with my music and with other things that I’m doing. So, I’m hype.  See also: How a Collection of 1M Music NFTs Could Mint the Next Platinum Record  Do you feel like crypto’s high fees and technical barriers to entry are having a particular effect on underrepresented communities?  One side of it is transforming the monetary mindset. I think a lot of artists came up from scarcity, and this idea that we didn’t have it, or we wouldn’t have it do these things. And a lot of the ones that I’ve onboarded, they’ve complained about the gas fee, and then minted their pieces and sold five times or 10 times more than their gas fee equated to. And they’re like, “I was so worried about that thing at one point, but now I’m not so worried about it anymore.”  But then on the other side, we have opportunities like the Mint Fund created by Ameer “Sirsu” [Suhayb Carter], where we’re supporting artists and paying for the gas fees. We’re trying to encourage marginalized communities to come on board. “It’s beautiful to see people see other people’s stories and be like, ‘I could do that too.’ And some of them came from my really rough times. I mean, if you talk to [the musician] Ibn Inglor, he grew up in the hoods of Chicago, and then started getting into Web 3 and crypto, and did a crowdfund and got 20 ETH for his latest project. It’s something that he never believed could have happened for him. But now he’s seeing it, and he knows it could happen. It’s just beautiful to see people’s minds change and their hearts change through this space.  What would you say to artists who are hesitant about crypto, who feel like maybe it’s too much of a gamble, or too much of an investment to get involved?  I came up from gambling a lot of my life – I’m just big on the leap. I’m a risk taker and everybody’s not like that. And if it’s not for you, it’s not for you. And that’s okay, too. I tell that to a lot of people who are skeptical about it. You don’t have to force this to yourself. If anything, I feel like I didn’t even force NFTs on me, NFTs just came to me, and it was like, alright, this makes sense. It’s all good if you’re not with it, but it’s gonna come to you eventually.  I come from being broke. Like, Brooklyn, New York, broke, dollar pizza life. And there were days where I would never believe this was going to happen to me. Or maybe I did, I just didn’t know how it was gonna happen. I did not know NFTs were going to be the thing, but I just always had this belief that I was going to be in my wellness and in my care. But I can’t force anybody to get into it. This is an organic thing that people have to like, decide for themselves if it’s for them.  And if you are ready to try to get into the game, I always tell people: Start with something small, never something huge. Don’t put all your money into this thing at once. Take a few hundred dollars. And if that’s what you can afford, mint something, or buy something even. And see what happens. Because if you’re just being skeptical, you’ll never see anything out of it.

But their pace of growth means they could become more dangerous as they become increasingly linked to wider financial networks.  “Material growth in banks’ exposures to unbacked crypto assets would expose them to financial, operational and reputational risks,” the central bank said. While no major U.K. banks have reported direct exposure to crypto, the BOE said, they are starting to offer services such as derivatives trading and custody.  If institutional investors are exposed to crypto as a “core part” of their investments, a steep fall in crypto values could lead them to sell other assets and possibly “transmit shocks through the financial system.”  The bank called for “enhanced regulatory and law enforcement frameworks, both domestically and at a global level.”  Growth in crypto asset exposure needs to be met with transparency in reporting, it said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Sheldon Reback,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/13/boe-says-growth-of-crypto-could-pose-risks-for-financial-stability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2f48287153d958a8875d08bc5eab1554fadf958-1500x876.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

How Long Will The Rest Take?,"Bitcoin has been the leading choice for investors in the crypto space being the first of its kind. However, there is more to why the cryptocurrency is so attractive for investors. The limited supply of the digital asset has secured its reputation as a deflationary asset, making it a great inflation hedge. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins that will be mined. BTC mining has now been going on for a little over a decade now. For the first eight years or so, mining activities remained pretty flat but picked up once the 2017/2018 bull market picked up. Since then, bitcoins have been mined at a rapid rate and despite multiple halvings taking place over the years, 90% of the total BTC supply has now been mined.

42421208,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgrbJ,1639414301,Neil Strauss Pens the Bored Ape Yacht Club ‘Tell-All’,"Neil Strauss knows how to write about weird subcultures. His infamous bestseller “The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists,” released in 2005, introduced the world to concepts like “negging” and “peacocking.” (If you ever set foot in a club in the 2000s, you’ve heard the terms.)  More bestsellers would follow. Ten in total. Books on survivalism, heavy metal, porn stars. But Strauss might have just stumbled into the wildest subculture of his career: The Bored Ape Yacht Club. (In the unlikely event you clicked on this story but are unfamiliar with the BAYC, you’ll find a quick primer in my conversation with its anonymous creators.)  This interview is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment.  So how is Strauss involved with the Bored Apes? It started with Ape #1798. This would be an Ape that goes by Jenkins, or rather “Jenkins the Valet.” The owner of Jenkins, in a legitimately inspired burst of creativity, invented an elaborate backstory for his Ape. Jenkins (the Ape) comes from humble roots, and now he works as a valet for the Yacht Club. Jenkins is always listening. Jenkins knows the Club’s juiciest secrets. Now Jenkins is ready to write a tell-all memoir about the Apes’ shenanigans.  And Jenkins will have help. During the real-life mayhem of NFT NYC, as Jessica Klein reported for Input, one of the Apes (or technically a human who owns an Ape) told the ecstatic crowd, “We needed to find the best memoir writer that ever existed … So, we found Neil Strauss.” The Apes cheered.  Now, this is where things get interesting. What, exactly, does it mean to write a “memoir” about a group of NFT avatars that kind of exists but kind of doesn’t? “That’s up to the community,” Strauss tells me. And this is literally the case. Through a clever use of NFTs within the BAYC ecosystem, the Apes can purchase the right to enter the “Writers Room 2.0″ – essentially a group conference call with Strauss. If you’re an Ape who splurges on a top-tier “yacht” NFT, then you get to be an actual character in the book. Your Writers Room NFT also gives you voting privileges, letting you help shape the narrative of the book.  It’s easy to be cynical about a book of fake apes. And it’s easy to dismiss all of this as crypto speculation run amuck. Then again, for years, blockchain advocates have championed its ability to “disrupt industries.” That’s usually an abstract concept. That’s usually all hype. But here is a concrete, hyper-specific example of a group of creative people who are using NFTs – and the wealth they generated through said NFTs – to recruit a blue-chip, bestselling writer to conjure a book into the world. Yes, the book will be about “fake apes,” but isn’t that just a form of fiction? Perhaps this will be the first true novel of Web 3.  Oh, and Jenkins the Valet? He is now repped by Creative Artists Agency. “Yes, that CAA,” writes Jenkins (the human owner) on his site. “The same one that represents Justin Bieber, Beyonce, Dwyane Wade, Cristiano Ronaldo, Brad Pitt, and Tom Cruise. They now also represent me, Jenkins The Valet, on my content endeavors.”  Get the whole of Crypto 2022: Culture Week here.  In the meantime, Strauss has been a busy guy. On Dec. 5, he became the first mainstream author (at least that we’re aware of) to mint a book on Ethereum and sell it on OpenSea:  “Surviving All Apocalypses: From Machine Uprisings to Bear Markets.” Only 892 copies were minted, and as of this writing, the “floor price” of the book is 0.59 ETH, or roughly $2,600, meaning the implied market cap is over $2.3 million. Has Strauss just cracked the future of publishing?  Strauss has long been fascinated by crypto and the NFT space. He’s been curious as to how, as a creator, he can make the most of this new world. He’s been asking himself, “What is the place for an author there?”  Now he has his answer.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  CoinDesk: How’d you get involved in this wacky world?  Neil Strauss: Back in 2016 I heard about Steemit. I thought, “That’s a cool model; you can get paid in crypto instead of likes.” And that really makes more sense. Because who cares about a heart emoji?  Right.  So I put something up and it made $7,500, or something crazy like that. And I’m like, this is really interesting. I then thought, “Let me do a test.” So I wrote a piece for Rolling Stone about Steemit, and then I wrote a piece on Steemit about writing the “Rolling Stone” piece. I wanted to see which performed better. And in terms of attention, interest and on a monetary level, the one on Steemit far outperformed the one on Rolling Stone.  Clever double-dip, sir. Well played.  Yeah, exactly. [Both laugh.] And this was before Substack. Then I realized, ok, this is the way, as a creator, for me to access this new asset class without a financial investment. It’s a time and creativity investment, which is how I’ve navigated the world so far.  When did you get into NFTs?  Last year was the year of DeFi. And at the end of last year, we all knew that this year would be the year of the NFT. And I got excited again. It was like Steemit all over again. So I thought, “Now this could be a place for me as a creative.”  How did Bored Apes enter the picture?  It’s so interesting, because so much of the NFT space started off on Clubhouse. If you went to NFT NYC, you’re almost not sure if this is a Clubhouse convention or an NFT convention. They’re inseparable. [In Clubhouse, I met] GMoney, who was one of the first people to really put down a lot on a CryptoPunk. Do you know GMoney?  Yeah, he had a Twitter thread explaining how buying the CryptoPunk was like buying a Rolex, and how it’s a signal to the community.  Right. So [in Clubhouse], GMoney was promoting that NFTs are the new status game. In the same way you get a Rolex you get a CryptoPunk. And I’ve been working through, what is the place for an author in the NFT space? GMoney said, “You should meet Jenkins.” And he made an introduction.  What excited you about the idea?  I loved what they were doing. This is something that feels new. There are like 18 ideas layered into it, but for one, the idea that this IP of an ape is worth more than flipping it for the market value of the ape. The idea that this is an IP play. That I’m going to create this other NFT, and that’s going to allow people to let their apes participate in different ways in the book, and for their owners to take part of the creative process. How cool is this going to be, to create as a community?  Dumb question, but can you tell me what the book is? How much of it is fictional? How much are you filling in the blanks with your own imagination and creativity? How much of it is the Apes’ imaginary exploits? Or are you writing about the actual people who own the apes? There are so many ways this book can exist. What’s the format?  That’s a great question. I love these questions. It’s so fun because you can’t really have these conversations with your friends. Because they just don’t get it. You just end up explaining why someone would pay that much for an Ape.  Oh, forget that! We’re way past that, we’re good.  No, I love that. I appreciate having this conversation. And it’s a great question. So as for what this book is? The answer is, that’s up to the community. However, the conceit that we’re starting with is that Jenkins the Valet has worked at the Yacht Club, and collected the secrets of some of the most rich and powerful apes in the world.  And he’s decided to approach the famous celebrity memoirist, you know, Neil Strauss, who’s also a character in this world, to do his tell-all book.  I’m envious, man. As a writer, I’m envious of this raw material.  It’s so fun. We did a first Town Hall talking about it, and we slipped into character. I played the memoirist, he played Jenkins, and people jumped on the call as their Apes and just started riffing. I’m recording it all, and that will all be raw material for the book.  Then more recently, they sent out little character forms, and I’m going to do a call later where I help the Ape owners with their storytelling, and with the background for their Apes. And building the story and the world around their Apes.  What’s the format of this Town Hall?  It’s on Discord. The Town Hall is really just a meeting of the holders.  Can you give me a few nuggets? What are some of the backstories of the Apes that you know so far?  Well, I don’t know yet. I’m about to hop on a Town Hall and the conceit of the call is for me to help them with their characters, but I think they’re already so proud of their characters, and they’re really excited about it. This is why this community is so exciting. This thing didn’t really exist a year ago, but now, all of the sudden, someone is thinking, “My Ape’s identity might be as important as mine. Or more important than mine.”  Let me throw a curveball here.  Yeah.  Let’s imagine one of the Ape characters has a surprise arc in the third act, and it comes out of nowhere and become the hero of this book. If that happens, the value of their Ape – which has an actual market value – could jump higher, right? So a Mr. Darcy-type character (from “Pride and Prejudice”), who gets the girl in the end, would have a higher monetary value. Am I warm at all?  Not exactly. I’m definitely not a predictor of monetary value. But there’s this whole interesting process, right, where they invested a lot of money in this Ape, and then they [the BAYC] sold these Writer Room NFTs. The rares [upper-echelon NFT] were these yachts, where your Ape gets a bigger role.  So someone buys an Ape, then they buy the yacht as the greater investment of their Ape, hoping that as the Ape is established as a character in the universe, then takes on greater value. And it’s really funny, because as it takes on greater value financially, it also takes on greater value emotionally.  This is fascinating. So any writer, when writing a book – and you’ve written a ton of bestsellers – is already playing God, in a way. Do you feel this added pressure that you’re playing God not just in the usual sense of creative world-building, but also a God who can bestow some very real-world financial consequences? Your creative choices could make someone rich, or maybe if you make the Ape do something stupid, the market value goes down.  Yeah, I think it’s interesting. I think that’s the impact books have, period. Like you said, I’ve done books with artists or musicians. And maybe they were touring gymnasiums when we started it, and then the book came out, and now they’re in arenas. Because storytelling is so important to the human species, right? And there’s such a great story around the Apes. So I do agree that great storytelling affects the value of these things, although really, people are irrational and the market’s irrational, so we have no idea.  One thing I’m curious about – ok, I’m curious about so many things here – but can you walk through the mechanics of the book? Like, is there a traditional publisher involved? Who’s paying you? How does it work?  I think they haven’t fully determined yet the best model for doing this. To me, it’s a new form of creativity. And the creative model is disrupted. I’m not sure what’s going to happen on the publishing model.  This leads me to something else I wanted to tell you, that I’m super excited about. I have a book coming out that’s going to be the first book ever minted to the Ethereum blockchain.  See also: A New Era of Media Begins With Tokenization | Joon Ian Wong  [Note: Strauss and I spoke just days before the minting of the book.]  It will be the first fully decentralized book that lives on the blockchain, where you can prove you’re the owner of the book.  Which book of yours?  I’m doing a new one, because I only want it to live on the blockchain. I don’t want it to live in the real world. Like, I don’t want it to live in the physical world at all.  Interesting…  So it’s called “Survive All Apocalypses” and it’s basically what I learned while researching my book “Emergency,” because it really fits into this idea about how to survive everything that can possibly go wrong in the world. It’s sort of a guide to that. Whether it’s surviving financial disruption, or the acts of nature, or acts of human stupidity.  You’re actually going to be able to read it page by page on OpenSea. It’s never been done before. I’m so excited.  What are the benefits of going this route? What’s the reason to put the book on the Ethereum blockchain?  There’s a bigger idea behind it, but part of it is so that, a) people can own a collectible book, and prove that they’re the owner of the book. And b), is to start to create the home for authors in this space.  Step one is proof-of-concept. Step two is to remove the middle person. Step three is the core readers and the author are engaged together in the financial part of the process. And I’m probably saying too much, but that’s the idea.  Dumb question, but how does this scale? I’m guessing it’s not a 1-of-1 where only one person can read your book. I’m guessing you want your book to be widely read. Can anyone read it, but to own it you have to pay for it?  Right, I think that’s it. Anybody can read it, but to own it you have to pay for it. And as a collectible nature for the first book – as far as I know – to the Ethereum blockchain, there’s an element of that. I just want to make these things possible and to open up the doors, and let other people run through it. I’m really just the author and the cheerleader for smarter people than myself.  This was fun. Let’s talk again.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2021/12/13/neil-strauss-pens-the-bored-ape-yacht-club,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/629a63625ed96d08eca360ea4c4b23b0f2cba2a8-784x592.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The network of some 400 savings banks across Germany will vote on whether to proceed with the project early next year, German business publication Capital reported Monday.  If approved, the banks would be able to offer trading of digital currencies such as bitcoin and ether to their customers direct from their checking accounts.  A pilot for the project is being developed by payment IT services provider S-Payment, Capital said.  The savings banks have about 50 million customers and manage about $1 trillion in assets. Even modest take-up could see sizable inflows of funds into the crypto market.  The news represents the second potentially significant development to come from Germany this year following the approval of a law in July allowing “Spezialfonds” (special funds) to allocate up to 20% of their portfolios to crypto, which could equate $400 billion.

In September, Simplex partnered with enterprise-grade crypto fintech platform COTI as the latter launched crypto-friendly bank accounts and Visa debit cards.  “Partnering with Nuvei, merchants on COTI’s blockchain finance network stand to benefit from increased adoption as a result of being able to accept cryptocurrency as a payment option,” Nuvei said in the statement. Customers of Nuvei’s partners will be able to sell their crypto holdings, while also using the resulting funds anywhere that Visa is accepted.

42407256,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUKpYd,1639409048,Introducing CoinDesk’s Culture Week,"You can measure cryptocurrency’s impact in money terms, and that’s certainly impressive.  With a market cap of $2.2 trillion, crypto is now an asset class to be reckoned with.  But you can also see the industry’s influence in more qualitative ways. 2021 was the year crypto became a mainstream cultural phenomenon as much as an interesting experiment in money.  Culture Week is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2022 series, which also includes Policy Week and Future of Money Week.  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have brought in millions of new fans. People who didn’t care when crypto was just money care now it’s a Bored Ape avatar or Kobe Bryant Tribute Dunk.  For many people, NFTs are easier to grasp than Bitcoin or Ethereum. Their first taste of this industry is inherently cultural. These groups are going to build the creator economy, making jobs and new niches along the way.  All of which is a very different story than, say, new types of sovereign money (central bank digital currencies) or payments.  More subtly, crypto itself became culture in 2021. This industry’s ideas affected how people dress, speak and communicate online. Words and phrases like “gm,” “HODL,” “WAGMI” and “to the moon” became part of the lexicon.  Get the whole of CoinDesk’s Culture Week here.  In previous “theme weeks” at CoinDesk, we looked at the year ahead in policy and regulation and the future of money.  This week, to complete our “Crypto 2022″ series, we explore crypto’s widening effect on media and entertainment, and how it’s creating culture itself.  We survey the building blocks of this new creator economy, including NFTs. We look at DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) like Friends With Benefits. We take the temperature of the Wall Street Bets-level enthusiasm of creative communities like ConstitutionDAO. And, yes, we hurtle headlong into the metaverse.  We see how consumer brands are soaking up crypto culture, and how artists are making use of its tools and distribution.  We hope you enjoy the mix of features, opinion and research.

Iris Energy is “a cheap way to play the digital gold rush,” said JPMorgan’s analysts, citing a “deep discount” for its shares versus other crypto miners.  “We think IREN is an attractive and efficient way to gain long exposure to bitcoin prices and sentiment and are initiating coverage with an overweight rating and $30 December 2022 price target,” the analysts wrote.  The shares of Iris Energy closed at $14.40 on Dec. 10, implying about 108% upside based on JPMorgan’s price target.  Meanwhile, another Wall Street investment firm, Compass Point Research, also initiated research on Iris Energy with a buy rating and 12-month price target of $22, implying more than 50% upside from Friday’s close.  “We believe IREN is well positioned with a large order for 14.5 EH/s of Bitmain with below market pricing and a strategy of owning/operating data centers,” wrote Compass Point’s analyst Giuliano Bologna.  Bologna also highlighted that Iris Energy has the “right pieces” to become one of the biggest bitcoin miners and that shares are currently trading at a discounted valuation.  The shares of the Australian bitcoin miner have fallen about 42% since its trading debut on Nov. 17. Last week, the company said its monthly revenue fell 10% in November because of timing issues and an increase in network difficulty.

42407248,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUKXDD,1639408327,Infinite Games: How Crypto Is ‘LARPing’,"At the 2018 “Devcon” Ethereum Developers Conference in Prague, internet guru and self-proclaimed “culture hacker” Stewart Brand shared the book that changed his life: “Finite and Infinite Games” by philosophy scholar James Carse.  “Infinite players look forward, not to a victory … but towards ongoing play,” states the book as an analogy to pushing cultural boundaries and hacking society to pursue serious goals, with a playful approach. Crypto communities are doing just this, and changing economics, policy and culture as they go.  Culture Week is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2022 series, which also includes Policy Week and Future of Money Week.  The global cryptocurrency market cap is $2.3 trillion. El Salvador has made bitcoin legal tender, challenging the role of traditional international money lending banks. Meanwhile, it’s all a big live action role-playing (LARP) game for high-profile crypto engineers, such as the Ethereum Foundation core developer team, which has opened multiple conferences by dancing and rapping, to remind the community to not take themselves too seriously and just keep on playing the game.  In crypto, we know that life and death are in the power of the meme. Memes are fragments of culture that stick in your head to propagate ideas. Memes are a communication device, they are signals that can move markets, and they can also be the life or death of a project. The latest meme in crypto is “LARPing.”  LARPing as participatory, playful learning  LARP refers to games where participants physically portray their characters, by wearing costumes, assuming personas and pursuing goals within real-world environments while interacting with other players in character. LARPing is the avatar we wear in the metaverse. It’s the ways in which we present ourselves as who we want to be.  Games can be designed to pursue educational or political goals to awaken or shape thinking. LARPs can range in size from a few participants to large public events with thousands of people. LARPs are a distinct category of role-playing game because players physically embody their characters, and the game takes place in a physical frame. LARPing is an essential part of participatory role-playing culture.  Blockchain communities are epic LARPs  Participating in blockchain communities is just like LARPing.  Blockchains have been referred to as knowledge clubs, meaning they are communities that pool information to make coordination decisions, such as shared investment or software development. Just like game masters in a LARP decide the rules of the game to facilitate play, crypto software developers have been referred to as important protagonists in the making of blockchain economies (or “hacker-engineers”).  Get the whole of Crypto 2022: Culture Week here.  Crypto communities have always been good at LARPs, with a full annual calendar of conferences and meetups in different locations coming and going around the world, and the issuance of “proof-of-personhood” protocols such as “POAP” non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Now, crypto communities are obsessed with crossing the barrier between digital and physical spaces with “the metaverse,” and have created the tools to do so with blockchain-based virtual worlds and NFTs. NFTs offer provable ownership over data, such as property rights, to cross between a digital representation of a physical asset, and vice versa.  Crypto communities are also demonstrating what it looks like to play virtual games in physical spaces. A16z’s Balaji Srinivasan predicts that these decentralized “network states” will collectively negotiate with existing jurisdictions and crowdfund territory in the real world. Crypto communities are already doing this.  Read more: ‘Crypto-States’ Will Compete With Corporates in the Metaverse - Kelsie Nabben  On a small scale, some communities are using NFT-embedded clothing to prove permissions or access rights to side parties at crypto conferences. More significantly, crypto community Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) now have the wealth and purchasing power to buy up plots of land.  Next, NFTs could provide verifiable credentials for people who own digital land to access houses, islands or entire territories in physical “meatspace.”  Crypto LARPs are having real-world impact. Now, governments are spending real money (in the millions of dollars) to acquire virtual land and create “metaverse embassies.”  LARP all you want  LARPing is the new meme in crypto to describe boundary pushing experimentation and next-level social and political gaming. A recent LARPing initiative launched by the GitcoinDAO community, humbly named “the greatest LARP,” is an “alternative reality game” and exercise in “networked storytelling.”  The point is to play a coordination game to learn about coordination games (which is cryptocurrency), as well as raising money for the Gitcoin mission of funding public goods in the in-game NFT auctions. The game espouses the Ethereum community ethos of replacing existing social institutions with peer-to-peer coordination games.  The game Killing Moloch, the god of coordination failures, purports the message that all around us in society there are coordination failures, and yet people so often fall into the tragedy of the commons by optimizing for extractive, self-benefiting outcomes, instead of win-win games.  Another expression of a recent crypto LARP is Loot Larp, a live action role-playing game in a castle in Barcelona. Loot Larp is enabled by digital-physical wearable gear that has “Kong” microchips embedded so people can scan each other’s items with a mobile phone and read data off them. These “new interactions unlock in a variety of smart contract games that play out simultaneously IRL and on the blockchain” stated the Loot Larp website. Limited edition items create limited edition realities.  LARPing is ad hoc networks at work  After Steward Brand but before the “memes” of modern crypto communities were “the Cypherpunks”: countercultural software developers and thinkers whose discussions and innovations in decentralized communication systems led to the invention of bitcoin.  Cryptocurrency is predicated on self-determination over communication networks. Now, crypto communities are manifesting the next instantiation of these self-governed coordination infrastructures by combining the tools of cryptocurrency, NFTs, DAOs and decentralized finance (DeFi) to re-claim not just digital but physical spaces.  LARPing is s an extension of ad hoc communication networks and the next iteration of the crypto economy. A LARP is like an ad hoc network that is here one moment for a gathering, a community and a shared experience, and gone the next. Mobile crypto wallets brought us the “pop up economy,” where people could come together, interact and disappear. Now, assets are digitized, owned, staked, claimed and the crypto economy has graduated to the full blown cryptoverse, leveraging the “collaterize everything” ethos of the “DeFi degens,” along with the hype of NFT ownership and reputation by showing it via your latest Twitter dp.  This time, community networks are not “immutable” and permanent but temporary and ephemeral. Cryptocurrency communities are fulfilling original Cypherpunk thinkers’ ideations of “temporary autonomous zones” with their ability to establish coordination networks, pool capital and mobilize. The question remains, what will they do with it?  A series game  From humble beginnings in a niche mailing list on the internet, to Bitcoin as the first fully functioning public, decentralized blockchain, to Ethereum, to micro DAOs who don’t even know what Ethereum is, cryptocurrency has matured to a point where crypto communities can really do whatever they want. With a loosely articulated political vision of providing infrastructure to the provision of public goods (in place of the state), crypto LARPs are a serious game.  What remains not so clear is the guiding vision in crypto. We like memes. We dig the metaverse. Is there a grand plan or is that dictatorial? And are we better playing numerous games to build multipolar worlds?  Executive Director of Ethereum Foundation Aya Myaguchi recently drew on the idea of “infinite games” to describe Ethereum as “growing the infinite garden.” What is most important is “how you play the game” and “playing together” states Myaguchi. It’s not just about technology, it’s about people.  As crypto tools evolve in the context of a series of infinite participatory learning games and community play, we are changing economics, policy and culture.  What this means is to LARP responsibly, and LARP on.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Kelsie Nabben,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2021/12/13/infinite-games-how-crypto-is-larping,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd7bac113f726bbf4bdb1aac867cf537c916dc51-5935x3962.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375719,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwADkr,1639407635,Tezos ‘Exchange-Traded Cryptocurrency’ Launches on German Exchange,"Digital asset manager ETC Group has launched an institutional-grade tezos exchange-traded exchange-traded product (ETP) on Europe’s Deutsche Börse XETRA under the ticker symbol EXTZ.  ETPs include investment vehicles representing commodities such as physical gold, lumber or oil, or cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or Ethereum’s ether, and they can be traded on stock exchanges.  The launch of EXTZ brings XTZ, the native token of the Tezos blockchain, to investors across 16 European Union countries as institutional appetite for accessible altcoin products rapidly grows.  “We’re responding to demand from institutional investors who’re looking to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum challengers by adding the Tezos-based ETC [exchange-traded cryptocurrency] to our portfolio,” said ETC Group co-CEO Bradley Duke in a statement.  The launch is part of a broader offering by ETC Group, which says it has plans to list five new cryptocurrency products this month. The ETCs would offer investors exposure to a handful of fast-growing layer 1 blockchains, including Tezos, Polkadot, Solana, Stellar and Cardano.  Exchange-traded cryptocurrency funds are popular with institutional investors because they can be easily purchased via an exchange, have passed regulatory scrutiny and – similar to gold exchange-traded commodities – are backed by a predefined amount of the underlying commodity or cryptocurrency.  Tezos ETP  Increasingly, institutional investors are paying attention to high-flying cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin and Ethereum’s ether, spurring a flurry of exchange-traded product launches catering to the new influx of capital.  This year, lesser-known altcoins such as Tezos’s XTZ (+116% YTD) and Cardano’s ADA (+650% YTD) have widely outperformed bitcoin (+67% YTD), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  “This institutional-grade product is a sign of confidence from the financial industry in Tezos,” Thibaut Chessé, an adoption manager with Nomadic Labs, a Tezos-focused research group, said in a statement.  Earlier this April, competing digital asset manager 21Shares launched exchange-traded products dedicated to Stellar’s XLM and Cardano’s ADA token. In November, the firm followed with its first polygon ETP.  The first tezos-backed ETP was launched in November 2019 on the Swiss SIX Exchange by digital asset manager 21Shares AG.

On Monday, Euler Finance announced their mainnet launch after 15 months of development. The platform allows for permissionless lending and leverage, and according to a demo showed to CoinDesk, boasts a number of features that may help it stand out in a competitive lending space.  Euler’s key feature is that users can borrow multiple assets at once while also posting multiple forms of collateral at the same time, which will streamline loan management for power users.  Additionally, listing new markets on Euler is permissionless, meaning that with the existence of a Uniswap market, users can create markets for borrowing and lending long-tail assets and niche tokens. In order to mitigate the risks associated with these often volatile assets, they can only be borrowed as an isolated asset and not as a bundle of assets.  The platform’s liquidations are an open system that uses a reverse dutch auction market that slowly raises the collateral liquidation percentage, as opposed to major markets that tend to have a set liquidation rate, hypothetically making liquidations less costly for users. The platform also has a built-in stabilization feature that takes a portion of liquidated collateral and adds it to the platform’s underlying reserve.  Crowded market  The closest competitors to Euler currently on the market may be Sushi’s Kashi permissionless lending platform and Rari’s Fuse pools, both of which allow users to set up their own money markets.  In the shadow of giants like Compound, it can often be difficult for new projects to gain steam. In an interview with CoinDesk, Euler founder Michael Bentley said that the platform is hoping to attract users with its accessibility to a wide swath of assets.  “In terms of the market share that we’re trying to carve out, we’re providing a home to retail users where they can come in and possibly deposit a whole basket of assets and hope to have earned some yield on those assets, and on the trading side, being able to access a wider range of assets to arbitrage and trade,” he said.  The project doesn’t expect to see explosive growth out of the gate, and indeed Bently told CoinDesk that the team of 10 would prefer a slow-and-steady approach.  “From our perspective, we’re really focused on managing risk – I don’t want to target some total value locked number we can market to people,” he said.  Euler will also be launching a liquidity mining program which will distribute governance tokens to lenders and borrowers in Q1 2022.

NUG’s Finance Minister Tin Tun Naing said in a Facebook post that the NUG will now accept the dollar proxy, USDT, for “domestic use to make it easy and speed up the current trade, services and payment systems.”  Although NUG holds no official power, it declared war against Myanmar’s junta, a government led by military leaders, in September. The junta came to power earlier this year after a military coup.  In May 2020, Myanmar’s central bank declared all digital currencies illegal. Hence, NUG’s adoption of tether appears to be an act of defiance.  While free from the erratic price swings that are customary with crypto, such as bitcoin and ether, tether has nonetheless long been mired in controversy over the opaqueness of the dollar reserves that back it.

In the future, customers will interact with companies through the metaverse rather than mobile phones, and crypto tokens will become native currencies for their platforms, he said.  SK Telecom is owned by SK Group, one of South Korea’s largest companies. The metaverse requirement stands in contrast to the traditional investments made by the country’s conglomerates, which tend to be focus on industries such as pharmaceuticals, logistics and manufacturing rather than the intangible, digital world.  The metaverse, a shared digital environment that mimics elements of the real world, has come increasingly into focus in recent months. In October, Facebook’s parent company renamed itself Meta to reflect its aspirations to be active in that type of environment, and plots of virtual real estate have been selling at record prices.  The metaverse represents a market opportunity of more than $1 trillion annual revenue, crypto investment giant Grayscale said in a report last month. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)  SK Square owns stakes in companies including chipmaker SK Hynix, where it is the largest shareholder, as well as 11street, an online shopping mall, and TMap Mobility, a ride services provider, Bloomberg said.

Turning to crypto platforms, Gensler said that exchanges are “doing a lot more than just trading,” given that they also hold crypto tokens and sometimes trade against their customer base.  ‘I’ve said publicly, come in, work with the SEC, get registered. They are fundamentally exchanges, but they also have this other activity going on inside of it. It’s really important to get that investor protection,” he said.

42375739,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwAE3j,1639388311,Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Resume as Stock Markets Get Over Fed Jitters,"Crypto investors appear to have resumed bitcoin accumulation, a sign they expect the price to rise, after U.S. stock markets overcame concerns about the economy to post their strongest gains in 10 months last week.  Blockchain data tracked by Glassnode shows the seven-day moving average of exchange flows turned negative a week ago, indicating net outflows. The level fell to -5,924 BTC on Sunday – the lowest reading since early August. According to IntoTheBlock, coins worth $3 billion left centralized exchanges last week, the biggest weekly outflow in five months.  Investors typically take direct custody of coins when anticipating a price rise. A continued exodus of cryptocurrency from exchanges implies less selling pressure in the market and scope for a sharp rally.  “Crypto going into exchanges may signal selling pressure, while withdrawals potentially point to accumulation,” Lucas Outumuru, an IntoTheBlock research analyst, said in a weekly research note published Friday.  The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.8% and 3.6% last week, their biggest weekly ascents since early February, even as a report showed U.S. inflation climbed to a four-decade high in November, sealing the deal for a faster unwinding of the crisis-era stimulus by the Federal Reserve. The Dow snapped a four-week losing trend with a 4% rally and bitcoin ended a three-week losing trend, adding 1.2%.  Renewed accumulation amid risk reset in traditional markets perhaps reflects investor confidence that much of the bad news has been priced in and the path of least resistance is to the higher side.  Risk assets took a beating in the second half of November and early this month on the emergence of the new omicron coronavirus variant and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s hawkish turn.  The bar for a hawkish surprise is set high  The Fed will hold its two-day meeting on Dec. 14 and 15. The central bank is expected to bring forward the timeline for the end of monthly bond purchases to March 2022 from mid-2022, and signal that it expects to start raising rates next year.  Fed fund futures appear well ahead of the curve, having already priced in a 25 basis point interest-rate increase in May. Further, rates markets are pricing in a 91% probability of five 25 basis point rises over the next two years.  Thus, the bar for a hawkish [anti-stimulus] surprise appears to have been set relatively high. Bitcoin and asset prices, in general, could remain resilient unless the central bank hints at more aggressive tightening than is anticipated.  “We know the Fed is going to maintain their hawkish stance given last week’s inflation numbers, but the critical question is to what extent. We will not be expecting any major surprise as most analysts are aligned towards a faster pace of tapering,” said Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds.  “Traditional markets have shown some resilience the past few days, and this should reduce further downside strain on the crypto markets, at least in the near term,” Neo said.  In all, there are 17 central bank meetings this week, including decisions from the Fed, Bank of England (BOE), European Central Bank (ECB), and Bank of Japan (BOJ).  The BOE will likely push out the first interest rate hike to 2022, Bloomberg reported. According to Marc Chandler, the chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, the BOJ is likely to be a non-event, and the ECB is less worried about inflation than its American counterpart and is unlikely to deliver a hawkish surprise.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/13/bitcoin-exchange-outflows-resume-as-stock-markets-get-over-fed-jitters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/355dde7d96e8335ba20048fb391121b501c9bd00-4735x3158.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375729,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwADtf,1639387274,Sushi Jumps 10% After Top Avalanche Developer Proposes Takeover,"Sushi tokens jumped as much as 10% in early European hours to over $6.19 from a low of $5.30 on Sunday night, data from markets tool CoinGecko shows. Prices retraced slightly to $5.90 at press time as traders likely took profits from the bump.  The move came shortly after Daniele Sestagalli, a top application developer on layer 1 blockchain Avalanche, proposed joining the platform in a post on the project’s governance forum.  “Sushi’s expansion and growth have been nonstop – it’s time to give Sushi additional resources and autonomy to continue and better define its mandate and governance during a time when it needs it the most,” the proposal read, claiming Sestagalli’s addition to the project could help end its ongoing woes.  “SushiSwap is bedeviled by a number of internal crises that are blurry to outsiders,” Shirokov Konstantin, CMO of DeFi tool Bonded Finance said.  “Traders are likely betting on the upside given the deep blockchain development experience and success of Sesta with previous projects like Wonderland, Popsicle Finance and Abracadabra in the competitive DeFi space,” he added.  Sestagalli and the ‘Frog Nation’ Collective  Sestagalli is behind top Avalanche projects like Wonderland, a treasury-backed currency protocol, and Abracadabra, a platform that provides collateral based on yield-bearing assets deposited by users.  SPELL, TIME and MIM – three tokens associated with the two projects – have a combined market capitalization of over $5.9 billion, data from CoinGecko shows, making Sestagalli one of the most influential developers in the crypto ecosystem.  Protocols like Sushi are open source, community-run and rely on proposals for further plans. Any community member – in this case, Sestagalli – can write up a proposal on the governance forum, and it is wholly up to community members to either take up the changes or ignore proposals.  Sestagalli proposes making Sushi a part of the multi-billion Abracadabra and Wonderland ecosystem, buoyed by the latter’s strong community that brands itself as the Frog Nation collective. Other changes include ending the issuance of “xSushi” – a token rewarded to Sushi stakers – deprecating the legal entity that controls development on Sushi, and adding Sestagalli and others to the core Sushi development team.  Comments on the proposal ranged from good to bad. “I always had a feeling Dani was going to be the perfect fit,” one member commented. “I personally will take a stance against this proposal. While Dani has done a great job with his projects they lack any real vision,” said another.  Community woes sour Sushi  Sushi is a multichain decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, which started out as a fork of Ethereum-based decentralized exchange Uniswap but quickly became one of the few “blue chip” DeFi assets in mid-2020.  DeFi is a blanket term that refers to lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain without traditional middlemen.  It relied on smart contracts to execute crypto-to-crypto trades, and later branched out to include lending, staking, and non-fungible token (NFT) services. Developers further expanded Sushi’s capabilities to include nearly 24 other blockchains and layer 2 solutions, a move that helped it lock over $10 billion in assets at one point.  But the platform has seen an exodus of top developers. Core contributors ‘0xMaki’ and Mudit Gupta left earlier this year, and chief technology officer Joseph Delong stepped down this month amid controversy regarding his position.  Reports of in-fighting also made the rounds in crypto circles, and the technical capabilities of the current team were questioned. Such actions caused community sentiment to gradually fade.  The likes of Sestagalli, however, want to keep development on Sushi alive: “Together we can move DeFi in the right direction where Sushi builds an accessible decentralized exchange, used on all chains by everyone,” he wrote in his proposal published on Monday.  Sushi tokens touched record highs of $23 in March 2021, as per data from CoinGecko, and have returned over 5,248% to early traders and investors. It has a market capitalization of $1.1 billion at press time.

It has opened up a plethora of use cases in various industry verticals with the help of blockchain projects that brings exceptional utility for global users. However, a blockchain project requires several ingredients in the right proportions to be successful. One of the essential ingredients is funding, which is done using different crowdfunding processes. Like any other investment, crowdfunding also acts as a monetary vote of confidence from the investors for the project. However, crowdfunding processes such as ICOs (Initial Coin Offering) have gained a tainted reputation as some shady tactic to prey on investors and evade accountability. This unfair reputation is because most crypto and blockchain projects can raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the project&apos;s development while requiring considerably less. Moreover, only some projects are transparent about the utilisation of the acquired funds, creating a rather opaque fundraising process.

The feat means 18.89 million bitcoins – of a maximum of 21 million – are now on the open market.  Reaching the milestone took nearly 12 years since the first bitcoins were mined on Jan. 9, 2009. However, the remaining supply is not expected to be mined until February 2140, based on network activity estimates and Bitcoin’s halving schedules.  Prices have mirrored the increasing supply as demand for newer bitcoin heats up. The asset exchanged hands for less than $0.10 when 10% of the supply was mined in early 2010, and hovered at $7.50 when 50% of the supply was mined in December 2012. As of press time, bitcoin trades at over $49,000, having declined 28% from its peak of $69,000 earlier this year, as per data from CoinGecko.  Bitcoin, as a proof-of-work network, relies on network participants called miners who continually process transactions and validate blocks in a process broadly referred to as mining.  Such participants provide their computing resources and hardware to solve millions of complex calculations on the Bitcoin network each second, receiving bitcoin as rewards. Miners currently receive 6.25 bitcoin for each block they mine, which would drop to 3.125 bitcoin after the next halving in 2024.  Meanwhile, not all of 21 million bitcoin is expected to be available on the open market.

42411126,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7Rzj,1639376155,Chatex Users Ask US Treasury to Release Crypto Frozen by Sanctions,"When Ekaterina Abreu awakened on Nov. 9 at 5 a.m. in her Russian home, she grabbed her phone and checked her cryptocurrency savings. Her account in the Chatex app she used to buy and store crypto looked weird: The balance of her XRP holdings was concealed.  Chatex support replied to her query, saying that they would provide information later. “I thought, it can’t be good,” she said.  Bad news soon arrived.  The day before, the U.S. had announced sanctions against Chatex, saying the crypto exchange had “facilitated transactions for multiple ransomware variants” and worked with the over-the-counter trading (OTC) firm Suex. Two months earlier, Suex had become the first crypto service to be sanctioned by the U.S. government.  As a result, Chatex says it had to suspend withdrawals for its 370,000 registered users. “Now I know I should have withdrawn my money immediately, not wait until it gets frozen,” Abreu said.  At the time, Chatex’s customers encountered a unique situation. But crypto users worldwide may soon face similar predicaments as U.S. regulators, with their global reach, try to rein in the illegal use of cryptocurrency. The prospects for these users to recover their money are unclear, even if they are innocent of any wrongdoing.  Suex and Chatex shared a co-founder and investor, Egor Petukhovsky, who has denied any wrongdoing and resigned from his Chatex leadership position as damage control for the company he’s been promoting the past several years.  It didn’t help. On Nov. 9, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Chatex for “providing material support to Suex and the threat posed by criminal ransomware actors.”  Chatex subsequently froze all withdrawals from its crypto treasury consisting of non-custodial wallets the firm operated itself and custodial ones hosted by the institutional crypto custodian firm BitGo.  At the time of publication, BitGo had not answered CoinDesk’s questions.  While crypto is global, regulations are inconsistent around the world, with some regions just catching up with stricter know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) trends. Companies that fail to prevent criminals from using their platforms may not face traditional criminal investigations in their home countries. But they may still be vulnerable to U.S. Treasury Department sanctions – a sudden punishment from abroad.  Chatex says that it had over 370,000 registered users. Among them is Alexander, a 35-year-old crypto trader who asked that his surname not be used. (“They don’t like crypto traders here in Russia,” he explained.) Chatex had multiple traders selling and buying crypto peer-to-peer, and a user-friendly interface and API, he said. Chatex also added new coins faster than most exchanges, so “you could change anything for anything,” Alexander added.  But Alexander also noted that, while OFAC blacklisted only 30 blockchain addresses, all of Chatex’s crypto was blocked, including Alexander’s coins.  Chatex co-founder Vladislav Bulochnikov told CoinDesk that a lawyer advised the company that because of the sanctions, the exchange should not touch any of its funds.  Specific license  U.S. authorities described Suex and Chatex as money-laundering vehicles that processed crypto extorted from American companies by some of the world’s most notorious ransomware gangs.  “Unprincipled virtual currency exchanges like Chatex are critical to the profitability of ransomware activities, especially by laundering and cashing out the proceeds for criminals,” the OFAC press release said.  For Abreu, Chatex was just a handy mobile app to buy and store her crypto savings. She would buy $30 to $50 worth of crypto every once in a while just to earn a bit to buy her two children New Year’s gifts. After the sanctions were imposed, Chatex locked $3,000 worth of her crypto, which she wants back, she told CoinDesk in a phone interview.  Abreu, a lawyer who has lived in the U.S. for the past 10 years, decided to contact U.S. agencies about the situation and eventually landed at OFAC’s doorstep. An OFAC officer who contacted her by phone was “shocked” that Chatex even had legitimate users, Abreu said.  But he recommended that she apply for the so-called specific license for the release of blocked funds – a special procedure designed for innocent parties to get their funds back from sanctioned accounts.  An acquaintance told her there was a Telegram group of Chatex users discussing what to do after their money ended up in a virtual limbo created by the way U.S. sanctions, the crypto custody market and evolving cryptocurrency regulations work.  The day after Abreu learned about the license and shared this information with other users in the Telegram group, Chatex itself started sharing the link for the application, Abreu said. In the ensuing days, some people applied for a license, although it’s hard to determine a total.  However, several days after she completed the form on the OFAC website, the agency wrote that it couldn’t locate the blocked funds. The OFAC representative instructed Abreu to attach a Chatex confirmation that she had stored her crypto on the platform, she said.  An OFAC media representative declined to comment for this story, pointing to two short online posts it published about blocked cryptocurrency accounts, one this year and the other in 2018.  An FAQ published Oct. 15 says that a U.S. crypto service “may choose to block each virtual currency wallet or opt to consolidate wallets that contain blocked virtual currency,” but that the service must ensure the return of the crypto to the owner following OFAC approval.  Trapped coins  According to the analytics firm Crystal Blockchain, wallets associated with Chatex hold over 5.3 BTC, 75 ETH, 218,000 USDT, 27,000 USDC and multiple other tokens. An XRP wallet mentioned by OFAC contains 46,489 XRP and is marked as BitGo’s custodial wallet in the XRPscan public blockchain explorer.  As for the BTC wallets, most of the addresses listed by OFAC are now empty, except one containing one bitcoin and another one with 0.007 BTC. The remaining bitcoins, which are not on the OFAC list, are blocked by BitGo anyway, said Chatex co-founder Vlad Bulochnikov.  On the other hand, 12 of the 30 crypto wallets attributed to Chatex on the OFAC list do not belong to the firm, Bulochnikov said. Those addresses interacted with Chatex though, he told CoinDesk. “To some of them, users withdrew to, and from others, they received funds [to their accounts with Chatex],” he said.  Bulochnikov declined to point at specific addresses that he said were erroneously attributed to Chatex.  Although blockchain analysis and attribution of addresses to real-world entities can be tricky, OFAC approaches the task carefully, said Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at the blockchain sleuthing firm TRM Labs and a U.S. Treasury alum. “I can tell you from my experience at Treasury that OFAC designations involve tremendous intelligence gathering, investigation and deliberation,” Redbord said.  Tom Robinson, co-founder of another crypto analytics firm, Elliptic, agrees: “My understanding is that OFAC typically requires pretty robust evidence before linking addresses to sanctioned actors,” Robinson told CoinDesk.  After the sanctions were imposed, Chatex’s team offered users a detailed explanation of why their funds had been frozen, on its main page. According to Chatex, BitGo blocked some of the funds and Chatex itself froze the other part because these funds might face sanctions.  Lawyers from the U.S. firm Ferrari and Associates, which specializes in cases involving U.S. economic sanctions, have advised Chatex not to touch any funds while the company is sorting things out with OFAC, Bulochnikov said.  BitGo currently custodies bitcoin, XRP and some other cryptocurrencies of Chatex’s users, Chatex said in its announcement, and all unspent transaction outputs are frozen “at the moment of sanctions’ appearance.” On the other hand, Chatex has direct control over wallets storing ether, TRON and tokens based on these two blockchains with many of these not included on the sanctions list.  However, “the movement of these funds will lead to their subsequent blocking on any other exchange,” Chatex said in the announcement. The company added that it’s trying to get a license from OFAC for the entirety of Chatex’s funds to be released, but also encouraged users to apply for individual licenses.  “But, more importantly, back then this procedure was applicable only to fiat structures. For instance, you have to fill in the recipient bank and the sending bank. Now we should adapt this procedure to our situation in order to be available to work with crypto,” the announcement said.  In a later update, published in Chatex’ Telegram channel on Dec. 8, the team said it was going to apply for a license to get its crypto released the following week.  Erich Ferrari, principal attorney of Ferrari and Associates, confirmed to CoinDesk that the firm was working with Chatex. He declined to comment on Chatex’s case in detail but said that “OFAC frequently uses its licensing authority to allow for certain transactions that would otherwise be prohibited by the sanctions.”  “It does this to minimize economic damage to innocent parties (e.g., in issuing wind down licenses), as well as when it furthers U.S. economic, foreign policy and national security objectives to do so,” Ferrari added.  Grim prospects  The sanctions hit Chatex hard. Hours after the announcement, all U.S. and European companies upon which Chatex has been relying stopped working with it and cut any communications, Bulochnikov said.  This list included BitGo, which immediately froze Chatex’s BTC, XRP and other wallets; blockchain analytics provider Crystal Blockchain, which Chatex used for compliance; London-based KYC provider Sum and Substance; web services company CloudFlare; and even Google. The Chatex team lost access to their business email accounts and cloud services, Bulochnikov said.  No longer able to operate, Chatex laid off almost the entire workforce the day after the sanctions, Bulochnikov said. He added that, in theory, Chatex could use its recovery option for the BitGo wallets; however, the mechanics of the recovery procedure would require Chatex to move all its bitcoin at the same time, including the blacklisted coins, which the company cannot do.  Benjamin Hutten, counsel at the law firm Buckley LLP, says Chatex users won’t have an easy time retrieving their crypto from the frozen wallets, particularly because of Chatex’s ties to Suex, which OFAC believes is involved in ransomware money laundering.  “And as OFAC’s actions against Chatex are part of a government-wide crackdown on ransomware, any application to release funds will be scrutinized very closely,” Hutten told CoinDesk, adding that “most Chatex users are unlikely to see the release of their assets in the near future, if at all.”  “It seems very unlikely that OFAC would simply allow Chatex to return funds to users,” Hutten added, because “OFAC typically imposes multiple conditions and limitations on any license it grants, and it is hard to see how it would trust Chatex to determine whether a user could meet the conditions and limitations that OFAC would impose on any release of funds.”  Regarding individual applications, OFAC might want to know why and for what purposes people used Chatex, Hutten said. “OFAC would have to be certain that the use of Chatex was for legitimate purposes, which is likely to be a tall task given its finding that more than half of the transactions that the exchange facilitated involved illicit or high-risk activities – including ransomware payments,” he said.  Abreu is pessimistic that she will be able to claw back her crypto from the OFAC freezer. So far, both OFAC and BitGo have told users they could not locate their funds. Abreu believes that’s because individual users have been neither sanctioned by OFAC, nor blocked by BitGo.  However, Abreu is determined to make Chatex pay, even if OFAC does not help the users, through the Russian and European justice system. She told CoinDesk that over the past two weeks she has reported the situation to the national prosecutor’s offices in Russia and in Estonia, where Chatex is registered.  “We must not get affected by these sanctions,” she said.",NEGATIVE,BTC | XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | XRP,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/13/chatex-users-ask-us-treasury-to-release-crypto-frozen-by-sanctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1feccae9a929e7c4603b47d68acbdbf9f8369a05-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
