42428064,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5jjh,1510612222,Bitcoin Cash Hard Forks In Bid to Ease Mining Difficulties,"Bitcoin cash appears to be successfully navigating a planned hard fork.  At press time, the majority of the network nodes (roughly 82 percent) have transitioned to new software (version 0.16.0 or later) that includes rules aimed at making the protocol's reward distribution more attractive to the miners that secure its blockchain.  Executed at roughly 21:00 UTC, the new version of the bitcoin cash blockchain has since amassed six blocks, while none have yet been mined on the older network. The results suggest that, while still possible, the fork will pass without the creation of a competing cryptocurrency.  As reported by CoinDesk, today's hard fork looks to switch the protocol to a different mining algorithm that will favorably adjust how hard it is for miners to create new blocks roughly every 600 seconds.  The idea is that by doing so, bitcoin cash will avoid the sudden changes in difficulty that have encouraged large numbers of miners to switch frequently between the bitcoin and bitcoin cash blockchains, migrating to whatever version is offering the most in terms of rewards.  Kept intact will be the rules that caused the creation of the cryptocurrency, which hard forked off of the main bitcoin blockchain in August by way of code that increased its block size to 8 MB, up from 1 MB on bitcoin.  Smooth upgrade  But it's the necessity of the mining change that has many thinking the upgrade will be smooth.  In remarks, Haipo Yang and Jiang Zhuoer, two major mining pool operators, said they didn't expect the change to be contentious. Other users, speaking in WeChat channels dedicated to the cryptocurrency, voiced similar statements of support for the measure.  This is due in part to the mining algorithm, which they acknowledged as having produced wild fluctuations in hash rate in the past. Developers have largely agreed.  According to the blog post outlininghttps://www.bitcoinabc.org/november the hard fork and the updated software, the current rule is ""problematic because it prevents consistently fast confirmations for users, and radically shifts the coin issuance schedule.""  In this way, Juan Garavaglia, a developer working to coordinate the fork sought to label it as successful, indicating his optimism that the majority of the bitcoin cash network will update.  ""For [the] fork... economically relevant and miners [nodes] are the critical ones,"" he said.  Already, startups including Yours and Ledger have migrated software.  Cash and carry  Should the software upgrade ultimately hold, it could bode well for bitcoin cash.  The protocol's supporters are arguably more encouraged about the network's future with the suspension of the Segwit2x hard fork, scheduled to occur on bitcoin last week. A controversial scaling proposal drafted by a group of miners and bitcoin businesses, Segwit2x looked to increase the bitcoin block size from 1 MB to 2 MB by way of a hard fork.  Still, with the measure failed, its supporters appear to be migrating to alternatives. This weekend saw bitcoin cash rise to a value of nearly $2,000, an all-time high, though analysts differed on whether this amounts to lasting (or even real) support for the network.  At the same time, money talks, and already at least one smaller miner indicated they're following the situation, possibly hinting at the psychological factors at play in the market.  Yimo Cheng, a China-based tax accountant who mines bitcoin out of his home, said he hasn't yet started mining bitcoin cash for concerns about its ownership being concentrated among Chinese buyers.  And while he believes bitcoin is ""more international,"" he ultimately said he would continue to monitor how the dynamic between the two blockchains developers.  He resolved:    ""I will observe it for a while.""            Bailey Reutzel contributed reporting.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ledger and helped organize the Segwit2x agreement.

Among Duffy's notable comments in the interview: insight into how CME would handle major fluctuations in the price. He suggested that CME could move to halt trading in the event of significant swings, and that existing rules would be called upon in the event of a catastrophic price decline.  ""Listen, when someone says to me, 'the price is going to zero, what are you going to do?' I'm not going to let it go to zero,"" he explained, adding:  ""I'm going to implement something.

The update indicates that there remains no immediate plan for addressing the frozen funds – although it's been suggested that a network hard fork would be required to find a solution, perhaps as part of the ""Constantinople"" network upgraded planned for 2018. That said, the startup raised the option of EIP156 – a late 2016 proposal from ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin focused on freeing up money locked in certain types of contracts – as one possible approach.  ""We have spent the last few days rigorously examining the events.

The situation raises the specter of The DAO, the ethereum-based funding vehicle that collapsed in the summer of 2016 following a debilitating code exploit.

42428052,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5jLh,1510591501,Dutch Regulator: ICO Environment Is a 'Dangerous Cocktail',"Regulators have issued a new warning to investors in the Netherlands about putting money into initial coin offerings (ICOs).  The Netherlands Authority for Financial Markets (AFM) – the country's equivalent to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – published a statement today outlining the risks it sees in the market for new cryptocurrencies, including those issued through the blockchain funding model.  Merel van Vroonhoven, chairman of the AFM, said in a statement:  ""Although the AFM sees the possibilities of blockchain technology for financial services, it points to the high risks of ICOs in the current hype. The high risk of scams and loss of intake combined with the hype around ICOs at the moment is a dangerous cocktail.""  The regulator went on to enumerate a number of possible concerns for investors, including a lack of transparency into some ICO organizers. AFM also warned investors to be wary of promises of high returns, as well as the risk of price manipulation in token markets that have low levels of trade velocity.  In a follow-up statement to CoinDesk, a representative for the agency called for greater cooperation among regulators on the issue.  ""At this moment we have sent out this warning as have other supervisors in Europe. As ICO’s are international phenomena’s and reach out to consumers/investors cross border, it is important we cooperate with the other European regulators,"" the representative said.  The release is the latest from a national-level securities regulator, adding to the growing chorus of concern from agencies in countries like Canada, Singapore and the U.S. In some cases, as seen in China and South Korea, market watchdogs there have moved to prohibit use of the funding model entirely.  The European Securities and Markets Authority, one of the primary markets regulators for the European Union, issued similar warnings today. The AFM does not have the ability to regulate ICOs, according to Dutch News.  Approximately $3.3 billion has been raised through the ICO model to date, according to the CoinDesk ICO Tracker.

42428073,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5jxh,1510587950,Dash Cryptocurrency Builds Base After Setting Record Above $500,"Dash is seeking direction after hitting new highs.  After reaching a new record above $500 on Sunday, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell back to near $350 today before regaining poise above the $400 mark.  As of writing, the dash-U.S. dollar (DASH/USD) exchange rate is $403. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency is up 4.58 percent over the last 24 hours, and 48 percent in the last week.  The record rally seen over the weekend is reportedly due to the flow of money out of bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies triggered by last week's suspension of the Segwit2x hard fork. Following the last-minute move to halt a controversial bitcoin upgrade, the markets saw a broad rally in the tokens of competing blockchains such as dash, bitcoin cash and others.  Also possibly driving price gains, the dash core team has announced the latest release of its software, an update that would bring a 2 MB block size and lower and transaction fees. The move may further strengthen the appeal of dash as a payment network, especially among those who believe that modifications to its blockchain will ultimately boost performance.  Indeed, price chart analysis suggests the base has shifted higher to around $380 levels and that markets could revisit record highs sooner rather than later.  Dash chart  The above chart shows:  Prices spiked after spending a better part of the last month defending the support level of $250.  The 5-day MA and 10-day MA signal a strong bullish bias (slope upwards), thus dips are likely to be short-lived.  The rising trendline (red) is seen offering support around $325 levels and the descending trendline is likely to act as a support around $306 levels.  Yesterday's close was above the critical resistance of $414.  Thus, the stars seem nicely aligned in favor of the bulls. However, the relative strength index is overbought. Furthermore, the 1-hour chart below does show scope for a pullback to $350 levels.  1-hour chart  The chart above shows:  Bearish price RSI divergence led to a strong pullback.  The RSI favors further losses.  However, the 50-MA and 100-MA are sloping upwards, so any dips to $350 levels are likely to be short-lived.  View  A potential technical correction $350 cannot be ruled out but could be quickly reversed.  Given the upward sloping nature of the key moving averages, the base appears to have shifted higher to around $380 levels.  A nice consolidation around $380–$400 could yield a fresh rally to record highs above $500.

Striking a concerned tone on the nascent state of the market, ESMA warned investors that the use of custom cryptocurrencies for fundraising comes with a ""high risk"" of capital loss. Adding to that, the authority alerted that ICOs may fall outside of EU laws and regulations, which in turn does not benefit investors.  According to a press release, the ESMA stated:  ""ICOs are also vulnerable to the risk of fraud or money laundering.""  The markets watchdog's second statement stressed that startups or open-source projects involved in ICOs are at risk of conducting regulated investment activities without observing applicable EU legislation, including its prospectus directive, the fourth anti-money laundering directive and other laws.  Firms involved in ICOs should give ""careful consideration"" to these activities, it warned, as failure to comply with EU rules would be considered a breach.  The news notably follows other recent ICO warnings including the Japanese FSA's statement to investors on ICO risks, and another from Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which said: ""Investors should be wary of the 'numerous risks' involved in token sales.""

42428057,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5jZh,1510581622,The SAFT Is a Symptom of Regulatory Uncertainty,"Jerry Brito is the executive director of Coin Center, a non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies.  In his first monthly column for CoinDesk, Brito argues that the SAFT framework, despite its limitations, is a reasonable path forward for token issuers given the ambiguity of current laws and slim chances of clarifying legislation in the near future.      Let’s put to rest a common misconception.  During a recent fintech conference at Georgetown Law, Brian Quintenz, a commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said that crypto-tokens offered in a pre-sale ""can transform."" He added, ""They may start their life as a security from a capital-raising perspective but then at some point – maybe possibly quickly or even immediately – turn into a commodity.""  This is how many understand the ""simple agreement for future tokens"" (or SAFT) concept – that the tokens start as securities and later become commodities. It's wonderful to see that Quintenz is open to novel legal and policy arguments, but that's not exactly how the SAFT model of token distribution is meant to work.  The impetus behind the SAFT structure is the fact that there is no bright line rule that determines which types of tokens are securities and which are not. Instead, what qualifies as a security can only be determined by an application of the flexible Howey test to the facts and circumstances of particular tokens. So, in the face of this uncertainty, someone who would like to pre-sell a token that they believe will be a commodity when it is delivered in the future can, in the present, issue a security that promises investors delivery of tokens once a functioning network or application has been developed and tokens can be used on it (i.e. a SAFT).  Once the tokens are delivered, and initial investors seek to sell their tokens on secondary markets to persons who may want to use the network or application, or perhaps to persons who wish to speculate on the future demand for the tokens, then it's appropriate to apply the Howey test to the tokens to determine whether they are securities or not.  The bet that issuers and investors of a SAFT are making is that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the courts, applying the Howey test at this point, will determine that the tokens are not securities.  So there is no ""transformation"" of a token from a security to a commodity. What we have instead are two separate things: a SAFT instrument that is and will always be a security, and a token that never was and won't ever be a security. This is more than an academic distinction. Transformation is unheard of, while a two-step approach is novel, but not inconceivable.  No guarantees  There are two things to note about this arrangement. First is that this structuring is not guaranteed to work.  I and many others believe that when these tokens are delivered, there will be a good argument to be made that the tokens should not qualify as securities under the Howey test. But it's just that – an argument – and the SEC and courts may not accept it.  Second, the argument depends on the facts and circumstances and the economic reality surrounding a particular token. In particular, the argument hinges on the value of the token not depending on the continued efforts of the original issuer, and that market demand for the token is driven by the token's commercial or consumptive use in addition to speculation.  Again, there is no bright line test for which tokens are securities, and a token's putative utility alone does not shield it from classification as a security.  Mission over minutiae  The SAFT approach is very clever, but cleverness is often the hallmark of poor legal reasoning. In this case, however, there's reason to believe that the SEC should want to look kindly on this clever argument.  We have to remember that the SEC's mission is not to robotically apply securities law, whatever the outcome. If it were, we wouldn't have such a flexible case-by-case test for securities. Instead, the SEC's mission is ""to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation."" Its application of the securities laws is in service of that mission.  With that in mind, put yourself in the shoes of an SEC commissioner. What state of the world would you want? One in which token presales are always offered to the public – including unsophisticated moms and pops – and hopefully they will buy them for their use rather than as a speculative investment? Or a world where developers, using a security instrument that you understand, limit pre-sales to accredited investors and only once the network or applications is functioning, and the tokens can actually be used, are they made available to the wider public?  It seems to me that a policy goal of protecting mom and pop investors and facilitating capital formation argues in favor of allowing a SAFT approach – even if it's a novel and clever structure that pushes the bounds of current law.  Long-term aspirations  An even better policy might be for the SEC to issue guidance articulating clearly how it plans to apply the Howey test to token sales, or for Congress to write a new law creating a bright line test that excludes tokens with certain criteria from securities regulation.  And Congress should certainly consider creating a safe harbor for exchanges that list tokens that seem useful and don't seem to be securities using some specific criteria, like GDAX's new Digital Asset Framework.  But given political realities, the probability that the SEC or Congress will do this in the next few years is probably pretty low.  While it's certainly worthwhile to advocate for these potentially better approaches, I don't think anyone can expect entrepreneurs to sit on the sidelines waiting for Congress or the SEC to act rather than taking a SAFT route, avoiding U.S. buyers, or avoiding a pre-sale altogether for token distribution.  A piece of the action  Finally, a SAFT approach has the unfortunate effect of potentially excluding the general public from participation (although perhaps not if a SAFT relies on the SEC's crowdfunding rules).  But this is not a problem specific to token sales; it's an issue of how our government has chosen to protect mom and pop investors – by creating incentives that limit many investment opportunities to the wealthy.  It might be time to do away with those limitations, but that's a policy issue that's about much more than token sales. And it's great to see Blockchain Caucus co-chair Rep. David Schweikert working to do just that though bipartisan legislation – which recently passed the House – that would expand the universe of persons who can become accredited investors.  The lesson in all this? Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

42428060,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5jbh,1510578003,Brazil's Central Bank Is Ramping Up Blockchain R&D,"The Central Bank of Brazil is building with just about every blockchain it can get its hands on.  In a new interview about its plans for the nascent technology, members of the central bank's blockchain team revealed they are resuming work with R3's Corda distributed ledger platform, months after ceasing development because the technology was deemed too ""immature.""  After the enterprise blockchain consortium launched version 1.0 of Corda in October, the central bank said it's ready to see if the newest version has what it takes to back up aspects of the country's financial infrastructure.  And with that, Banco Central do Brasil is now developing proofs-of-concept (PoCs) on four different platforms, trialing ethereum, JPMorgan's Quorumhttps://github.com/bacen/salt-hyperledger and Hyperledger Fabric alongside its Corda work.  The PoCs broadly focus on using blockchain to both back-up the central bank's current real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), called the Brazilian Payment System, as well as better align the organization with the growing momentum for central banks to innovate using blockchain technology.  Speaking to that trend, the deputy head of the central bank's IT department, Aristides Andrade Cavalcante Neto, told CoinDesk:  ""We are a central bank, and we enjoy a lot of stability. But you have to think change. You have to think in a different business model. So, for us, that's the most difficult part of this kind of work when we're talking about innovation.""  Real-time blockchain  While the blockchain team at Brazil's central bank had considered a number of use cases – including enabling foreign trade in local currencies and an identity management system – as far back as January, it ultimately selected RTGS as its focus, according to the team's analyst Jose Deodoro De Oliveira Filho.  Instead of being netted periodically, RTGS is used to allow banks to settle their large-value debits immediately as they occur. Because these transactions are relatively infrequent, they have been identified by multiple central banks as a potential use case for blockchain.  Banco Central do Brasil processes 314,ooo transactions per day, moving a total of 839 billion Brazilian reals, or about $255 billion by today's exchange rate.  Talking to CoinDesk, De Oliveira elaborated on the decision to focus on the RTGS use case, stating that while the central bank's current system has been helping commercial banks reconcile accounts for 15 years, they still don't have a backup system. And they're interested in whether a blockchain it suitable for the job.  According to De Oliveira, each of the platforms has its own ""advantages and problems,"" but really only two main obstacles – albeit big ones – remain.  Specifically, the central bank can't ""prove"" that implementing a blockchain system would be cheaper than implementing something more traditional, he said. And there are ongoing questions about the privacy of using a shared, distributed ledger.  ""If you want privacy you can't have the other features, and if you want the other features, you can't have privacy. So, that's what we're trying to solve right now,"" De Oliveira said.  Out in the open  But while RTGS is the primary focus of the central bank's blockchain work, it's also testing a blockchain-based ""information exchange.""  Revealed for the first time to CoinDesk, the exchange, called Know Your Citizen (seemingly a play on the regulator-mandated know-your-customer compliance), is powered by Quorom in Microsoft's Azure cloud. It also uses Truffle, a popular ethereum development framework, to interact with smart contracts.  Details about the project are ""kind of a secret right now,"" according to De Oliveira, but he said more information should be forthcoming in the ""next couple of months.""  Elsewhere, the central bank is increasingly open regarding its blockchain development.  Not only did it introduce its findings at the Central Bank Summit hosted by Ripple in New York last month, but also it has also presented its work to the International Monetary Fund, and will, later this month, appear at Blockchain Summit 2017 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  As other central banks from all around the world, including Hong Kong, Japan, Canada and Europe, are typically in attendance at these events, Cavalcante Neto framed this openness as a way to workshop ideas with peers, saying:  ""It's very useful, this kind of meeting, to understand the different perspectives from different central banks about the technology.""

As of writing, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is at $6,523, having reached a high of $6,559 so far. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has gained 3.54 percent in the last 24 hours.  Still, chart analysis indicates that BTC has retraced 38.2 percent of the sell-off from Nov. 8 high to Nov. 12 low. That's when prices hit a two-and-a-half week low near $5,500 – a near 30 percent sell-off from last week's record highs.  Largely believed to be triggered by the suspension of the Segwit2x hard fork, a software upgrade that might have brought a transactional boost for the cryptocurrency, investors had reportedly begun moving funds across to bitcoin cash (BCH) following its abandonment, resulting in a rally for the rival cryptocurrency.  In this way, the sharp recovery seen today has been accompanied by an equally sharp pullback for bitcoin cash, which rose more than 30 percent last week, and briefly overtook ethereum as the number two cryptocurrency by total value over the weekend.  Still, it is too early to say that bitcoin prices have found a bottom.  As discussed yesterday  , the price chart analysis shows the current pullback could find a bottom around $5,000 levels.

Announced during the Humanitarian Blockchain Summit in New York on Friday, the pilot involves participation from the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and the United Nations Office of Information and Communications Technology (UN-OICT), a press release indicates.  Storing digital identities on a blockchain, the release states, provides a ""significantly higher chance of catching traffickers."" Additionally, securing identity data on an immutable ledger will make trafficking attempts ""more traceable and preventable.""  According to Dr. Mariana Dahan, co-founder and CEO of WIN, ""invisible"" children under the age of five and who do not possess a birth certificate are at ""risk"" and can fall into the hands of child traffickers. These children are often missed by social programs offered by governments or development agencies.  She added:  ""Several developing countries are actively looking at more efficient ways to prevent child trafficking. Identification is always at the heart of the solution.""  Child trafficking uses fake identification documents to transport young people across borders for eventual forced participation in serious illicit activities including the sex trade, the illegal human organ trade, and others.  Yannick Glemarec, UN women deputy executive director said, ""Child trafficking is one of the greatest human rights abuses.""  Blockchain, she continued, would be a ""potentially powerful"" technology to address the problem and potentially save ""millions of children.""  In a move to foster the pilot, the partners are seeking support from private companies, NGOs, academia, and others that are willing to contribute to help end child trafficking. Plans were also revealed for the launch of a ""Global Challenge"" that would seek ideas and expertise in using blockchain for humanitarian projects.

42380039,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LmDH,1510545614,Bitcoin Gold Goes Live After Bumpy Blockchain Launch,"The newest fork of the bitcoin blockchain is officially live after a rocky start.  Developers for the project, dubbed bitcoin gold, published software for the breakaway cryptocurrency today, releasing the code on GitHub as well. Aimed at blocking the use of specialized chips for mining, the project revealed last week it was eyeing a formal launch on Sunday, weeks after it first initiated a split from the main bitcoin blockchain.  As such, the launch caps a lengthy period of development for the cryptocurrency, which follows bitcoin cash, a near $30 billion network that split off from bitcoin earlier this summer. Bitcoin gold also represents the latest instance of an ""airdropped"" cryptocurrency forked from the main bitcoin chain, which is distributed to anyone who owned bitcoin at the time of the split.  Now, public mining for the cryptocurrency has begun, with several mining pools opening up in coordination with the launch. Yet the process of distributing the software – no small feat in a permissionless, open-ended environment – came with some complications.  As detailed in the project's official Slack channels, some users had problems connecting their nodes to other computers on the network. Others allege they were receiving spam messages containing links to fake (and potentially malevolent) software clients.  As might be expected, trading interest was heightened in the run-up to the launch, given that prior to the launch, several exchanges launched futures tied to bitcoin gold. The price of those futures has seen significant volatility in the past several days, exceeding $500 in value earlier this weekend.  Currently, BTG futures are trading between roughly $260 and $290, according to CoinMarketCap – a decline of over 30 percent in the past 24 hours.
