42398087,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbM9sT,1419288953,GoCoin Gains Strategic Investment from GAW Miners for Software Development Push,"Digital currency payments processor GoCoin has received a new strategic investment from US-based mining company GAW Miners.  The move represents the latest investment for the Singapore-based service, which offers merchants payments options in bitcoin, as well as a number of digital currencies.  GoCoin  declined to disclose the amount, but called the investment “meaningful”. GoCoin has received investments from a number of companies in the bitcoin space, including bitcoin mining giant BitFury and e-commerce platform Bitcoin Shop.  According to GoCoin, the funds will be used to continue developing its proprietary payments platform, as well as build out its existing infrastructure. GoCoin says it is exploring cooperative efforts with GAW, and has plans to integrate its new altcoin, paycoin, into GAW's payments service.  The year-end funding caps a busy year for GoCoin. The firm has inked partnerships with a number of companies, most notably PayPal, and according to co-founder and CEO Steve Beauregard, the move will position GoCoin toward continued growth in 2015.  Beauregard told CoinDesk that overall, the past year has been a fruitful one for the company.  He said:  “2014 was an absolutely exceptional year from the GoCoin perspective.”  Growth for GoCoin  Beauregard framed the company’s efforts in the last year as a bid to grow the proliferation of crypto-payments options among merchants. Companies within GoCoin’s network include Shopify, CheapAir and Hustler magazine.  GAW CEO Josh Garza echoed this sentiment, telling CoinDesk that his company “really believes” in the GoCoin team and cited the payments startup’s efforts as a worthy investment. Other companies that have made strategic investments in GoCoin include KnCMiner and ZoomHash.  Beauregard also cited initiatives focused on regulator outreach as an important part of GoCoin’s growth strategy.  “The progress we have made educating regulators and banks will pave the way for generations of low-cost cryptocurrency payments and protection of consumer privacy in commercial transactions,” he said.  Paycoin addition  No date has been set for GoCoin's expected integration of paycoin. According to Beauregard, there is a need to look into new coins as the market evolves and the needs of merchants change.  Paycoin has run into headwinds in the past few days that have raised questions about the project. After suffering an early fork during the proof-of-work phase, GAW was forced to issue new wallet updates this weekend during a problematic transition to proof-of-stake.  According to GAW staff, the plan was to ""scale down"" the network hash rate during the transition, which involved an extension of the proof-of-work phase by another 24 hours. Some in the community questioned the need for such a move, given the hard-coded parameters for such a shift in proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid crypto networks.  What followed was a multi-hour freeze in the blockchain on Sunday after block 8,046. The stoppage forced services like crypto-conversion tool ShapeShift to issue advisories to its customers about the stuck blockchain and complaints later rose among customers about the lack of information.  After several hours GAW staff announced that a fix was underway. During this time, the project's public GitHub page became unavailable as well, and later GAW staff blamed activity during the final hours of proof-of-work as the cause for the holdup. Updated wallets have since been released.  GAW spokesman Christian Gogol told CoinDesk at the time that ""paycoin is still quite young"" and that such events are to be expected during the early post-launch days.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/22/gocoin-gains-strategic-investment-from-gaw-miners-for-software-development-push,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82ca3b895c14f92ccd2a01b16ccc297c552b89e9-1480x852.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398089,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbM9uR,1419283529,All Things Alt: Altcoins for Amagi and New Features for Viacoin,"While the altcoin markets may still be suffering from the volume doldrums of the summer and fall, that doesn’t mean that work hasn’t continued in the meantime – far from it, according to recent developments.  Though the news isn’t 100% positive on the alt front, the space continues to push ahead as it always has, for better or for worse. Read on for some of the recent happenings that have come across the All Things Alt desk.  Amagi Metals announces altcoin integration  Bullion dealer Amagi Metals has inked a new partnership with digital currency payments processor GoCoin.  The move represents one of the most high-profile altcoin integrations to date. In recent months, GoCoin also inked a partnership with PayPal and Shopify to facilitate digital currency payments for dogecoin and litecoin, in addition to bitcoin.  According to the 18th December announcement, Amagi will begin accepting litecoin and dogecoin on top of its existing bitcoin acceptance policy. The company has already thrown its support behind digital currency, which includes a plan to phase out fiat payments by the end of 2016.  In a statement, Amagi CEO Stephen Macaskill said that the intention has always been to explore wider adoption of digital currency payments. Macaskill has previously said that he expects bitcoin to replace the US dollar within his lifetime.  He added:  “We’d been waiting for a payment processor that could see the larger picture beyond bitcoin payments alone. The GoCoin platform is uniquely designed to accommodate emerging cryptocurrencies, which was a critical factor in our decision.”  GoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard said in a separate statement that Amagi’s move puts them in a position to begin “embracing the larger ecosystem of cryptocurrencies”.  Viacoin integrates CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY  The viacoin project is integrating CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, an opcode proposed for bitcoin by core developer Peter Todd that opens the door to trustless escrow, hub-and-spoke micropayment networks and other potential applications.  Todd’s proposal, which has drawn support from other core developers and is currently undergoing peer review, builds on an existing script, nLockTime, which in essence allows the user to designate when a transaction becomes valid. CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY takes it one step further by assigning a point in time (based on block height) when an output can be spent.  In conversation with CoinDesk, both Todd and viacoin developer BTCDrak suggested that the altcoin’s network is a worthwhile testing ground for the opcode.  “There's lots of issues you just don't find until you use things, and some of those issues you just don't find unless you use things for financially valuable uses,” he said.  Todd explained that by putting CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY into an existing and functioning blockchain, more data can be collected on its effectiveness – or faults – thereby providing more information for the ongoing peer review process. By implementing the opcode into viacoin, he added, insights can be gleaned that will ultimately support bitcoin as well.  As part of the implementation, viacoin has also shifted to auxiliary proof-of-work, known also as merge mining. Merge mining allows miners to process blocks if they are mining on a scrypt network with a higher hashrate than the viacoin network and reduces potential security issues that can occur when a network hashrate declines.  Archcoin community launches crowdfunding platform  A new crowdfunding platform called BlockTrust has launched from the archcoin community that utilizes the ClearingHouse protocol to notarize project certifications on the viacoin blockchain.  BlockTrust, which launched on 18th December, is being pitched as a secure solution for those looking to crowdfund new altcoin projects and potential investors looking to support these initiatives. According to the announcement, BlockTrust will act as escrow service for projects that use the platform and institute staged fund releases over time.  The platform is offering both certification as well as crowdfunding support for potential projects, which are required to pay fees for services rendered. These certifications are then time-stamped on the viacoin blockchain as part of the ClearingHouse protocol's notary mechanism.  While there are currently no projects listed on the main page, according to the announcement, BlockTrust will host a crowdsale for SendChat, a crypto messaging app with its own altcoin, in early January.  CoinDesk spoke to archcoin developer Edgar Soares, who said that BlockTrust can help reduce the risk for investors who are interested in crowdsales but are concerned about projects that lose value or prove to be fraudulent.  Soares explained:  “The problem is not in the blockchain itself but in the lack of trustworthy and secure platforms and tools for those that do not have experience with this new tech. I'm hoping to introduce some self sustaining mechanisms to minimize investor losses from these bad actors and in this way bring some confidence and capital back to cryptocurrency startups.”  Opalcoin suffers wallet malware attack  Earlier this week, the opalcoin project ran into some trouble after what appears to be a serial malware attack targeting altcoin wallet data files.  According to Bitcoin Talk, the opalcoin development team announced on 15th December that someone posting under the ID “diabanhxeo” successfully distributed malicious wallet software that, in turn, facilitated the theft of wallet.dat files from the computers of those affected. As much as 2.5m opalcoins were stolen in the attack, accoring to that project’s development team.  That user’s post history points to a broad effort to distribute software through the altcoin community, including threads for ultracoin, viorcoin and others.  The hack led to a debate among opalcoin’s stakeholders on whether or not to initiate a blockchain rollback, an action which would effectively undo the history of transactions following the hack. In July, similar action was taken by the vericoin team after the loss of roughly 8m vericoins.  A vote to conduct a rollback was held, with those involved weighing in favor of one. However, subsequent negotiations led to the return of 1.6m opalcoins and as a result, the rollback was canceled.  “Thanks to 65% of the coins being returned, the Opal Team believes this danger has been averted and a rollback would have set a bad precedent, and thus is not justifiable,” the team announced on 16th December.  In an interview with CoinTelegraph, one of the lead developers for opalcoin explained that the opalcoin team wanted to avoid damaging the viability of the altcoin’s blockchain, and that in the future more stringent controls will be put in place when new wallets are distributed.  Strange alt of the week  What’s in a name? For cryptocurrency developers, the name of a coin can be the deciding factor in whether or not the altcoin project even takes off, let alone appeals to traders, miners and, in rare cases, the others who will actually use the coin.  We’ve covered a fair share of strangely-named alts here on All Things Alt, but money – yes, 'money' – may hold the candle as one of the most bizarrely named coins to date for the mundaneness of the choice.  As stated in its Bitcoin Talk thread, money (sign: $$$) is pitched as “the next generation of digital money”. With the slogan “in money we trust”, money utilizes the scrypt mining algorithm and sports a max coin supply of roughly 265m coins.  Active development of the coin appears to have ceased. In mid-November, according to Bitcoin Talk, a debate grew between supporters and a representative of the development team regarding a planned 6% premine. At the time, the representative warned that production of wallets would be hampered if the premine was reduced.  Ultimately, a 2% premine was chosen and a pair of developers reportedly exited the project soon after.  Have a tip about a notable happening in the altcoin world?

42398096,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbMA0L,1419253265,Coinffeine Demonstrates Distributed P2P Bitcoin Exchange Platform,"Spanish cryptocurrency startup Coinffeine has demonstrated a trial version of its upcoming peer-to-peer (p2p) bitcoin exchange platform.  The distributed and open-source exchange will allow users to buy and sell bitcoins anonymously without having to depend on a centralised entity.  Coinffeine  describes the protocol as ""pioneering"" and says it will allow banks and other financial institutions to offer cryptocurrency services with ""all legal guarantees"".  The application has been “more than a year in the making” the firm says, adding that it has received support from the bitcoin community, as well as the banking and FinTech sectors.  CEO Alberto Gómez, who presented the product at the demo event in Madrid, said Coinffeine is sure the software will make a big impact on the global bitcoin ecosystem.  He added:  ""Coinffeine is a technology that serves as a perfect framework where banks can meet the future world of finance brought on by the cryptocurrencies.”  First live demo  During the session, Álvaro Polo, co-founder of Coinffeine, executed a purchase of 0.5 BTC via the platform, while Sebastian Ortega (also a co-founder) explained the theoretical and technical basis of the protocol, which is based on 'game theory'.  The exchange protocol uses a distributed contract concept known as a 'micropayment channel'. Deposits provided by the two participating parties are used to ensure fairness and incentivise them to complete the transaction.  Event attendees were presented with codes allowing them to install the trial version of the application. This will allow them to take part in the testing stage prior to the official beta launch, which is slated for early 2015.  Back in May, the company’s chief technology officer and co-founder Ximo Guanter told CoinDesk that the company’s ultimate goal was to create a trustless, truly peer-to-peer exchange platform not unlike file-sharing platform BitTorrent.  Gomez pointed out that the new technology provides banks with an opportunity to enter the cryptocurrency space while avoiding the vulnerability inherent in centralized exchanges.  Just last month, Spanish bank Bankinter made an investment in Coinffeine through its innovation foundation.
