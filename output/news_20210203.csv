42385898,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOprd,1612393341,"Saylor, MicroStrategy Offer Playbook for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption at Annual Summit","Michael Saylor, the MicroStrategy CEO-turned-king of bitcoin treasuries, called upon fellow business executives Wednesday to avoid the path of financial “serfdom” at his virtual WORLD.NOW bitcoin-themed conference.      In his solo address, Saylor detailed the cryptocurrency playbook that propelled his three-decade-old data firm to newfound relevance in less than a year.      Largely eschewing the near-mystical rhetoric that has punctuated his public crypto musings since August, Saylor focused on hardline business strategies, procedures and dollar-sense language in a calibrated appeal to corporations.      “There's a macroeconomic wind blowing – big – it's gonna impact $400 trillion of capital. That capital is sitting in fiat instruments that are being debased. That capital is going to want to convert into strong money,” said Saylor.      Saylor’s goal remained the fomenting of monetary revolution. For months now he’s tweet-preached the gospel of a harder, faster, stronger “monetary network,” namely bitcoin, which Saylor became enamored with at the height of COVID-19 shutdowns and a disciple of when fiat printers started going into overdrive.      While the notoriously brash CEO’s past declamations in support of bitcoin played to retail traders, his sermon at the conference targeted a far larger buy-side force: corporations. MicroStrategy was the first U.S. corporation to invest its dollarized treasury in bitcoin, and now boasting a 71,079 bitcoin reserve, Saylor seemed determined his company won’t be the last.      Accountants, lawyers and company executives joined Saylor’s effort. Their attempts to front-run corporate what-abouters detailed the practical whys and hows of BTC accumulation in, at times, excruciating detail. But even at its most pro-bitcoin moments, lawyers reminded viewers to be wary of OFAC sanctions violations.      MicroStrategy’s show could not be separated from the CEO at its ring master. Saylor’s anchoring hour set the tone for reams of corporate bitcoin programming that followed.      “Every company has to make one of two choices” when faced with a world of belligerent money printing, Saylor said. “You either have to decapitalize, which is kind of like self destruct … or you have to recapitalize with an asset which is going to appreciate faster than the rate of monetary supply expansion. This is where bitcoin comes in.”      And this is where the dollar goes out. In Saylor’s world view, there’s no scenario in which the dollar retains its global reserve status. To the man who shepherded over $1 billion of MicroStrategy’s reserve dollars into bitcoin, that cryptocurrency is the only viable way for companies to survive the coming debasement apocalypse.      Listen: Michael Saylor’s Mission to Get 1,400 Corporations Into Bitcoin      The shepherd said “fiat derivatives” offer treasuries a false respite from “the road to serfdom.” Bonds, stocks and real estate are just a placeholder for fiat, he said. They will yield increasingly diluted returns so long as that underlying fiat continues to debase. The answer: Convert them all to bitcoin.      Saylor offered debt raises, equity issuances and cash flow conversions as alternate balance sheet strategies for establishing a corporate bitcoin trove.      “Every company on earth can do that. Right? Every company has some amount of treasury assets,” Saylor said.      ARK Investment Management projects that if every company in the S&P 500 invested 1% of its assets into bitcoin the crypto’s price would increase $40,000.      Saylor also offered a playbook to companies approaching BTC as a business. He said firms can start by developing bitcoin tools, building bitcoin software, offering bitcoin services providing bitcoin infrastructure, saying, “All of these things will drive revenues and they'll drive cash flows.”      “If you want to maximize shareholder value, you want to preserve or create shareholder wealth, then you can either work on a balance sheet strategy for bitcoin, or you can work on a P&L strategy for bitcoin,” he said.      MicroStrategy’s corporate deputies followed up Saylor’s talk with a point-by-point of the challenges companies might face in adopting bitcoin. Referring to MicroStrategy’s own path, company President Phong Le and Jeremy Price, the financial planning executive, laid out the stakes and methods of getting one’s company on board.      Read more: Cathie Wood: More Tech Companies Will Adopt Bitcoin Treasury Reserves      For “some it takes minutes, some it takes hours, some it takes days some it takes weeks, usually not months, but when that flip switches, you'll have a team of advocates who are ready to move forward and really just change how you look at your business strategy,” Price said.      Then it was the legal department’s turn. MicroStrategy’s legal counsel addressed questions in corporate governance, regulatory concerns and policy that underpin every decision in corporate America. The admittedly dry presentation outlined a concrete roadmap to implementation.      Policies to staunch insider-trading shore up the company’s ethical front, they said. For example, MSTR employees are prohibited from front-running company bitcoin buys with allocations of their own.      Le then returned to the stage with two tax experts to walk through bitcoin’s financial implications.      Together, the back-to-back-to-back-to-back talks offered MicroStrategy’s strongest case yet that its 2020 flirtation with bitcoin is no passing fad. With over $1 billion in bitcoin and and almost assuredly more bets to come, the company is now positioning itself to lead a massive corporate charge.      The conference’s lineup (which also featured panels on the actual business: building data intelligence products) was unabashedly blunt in its goal. Thursday, WORLD.NOW will trot out 10 crypto service providers in a marathon industry roadshow of firms vying for the corporate bitcoin allocations Saylor aims to seed.      “All of the vendors you'll hear from tomorrow want you as a customer,” Le said.      MicroStrategy’s crew of bitcoin can-doers spent Wednesday publicly outlining the backroom how-to’s of a strategy that’s made Saylor one of the most influential bitcoiners to emerge from corporate America.      “We're at the beginning of a very very long trend here,” said Saylor. “And so, with that, I have more stuff to say, I don't have time to say it, but, you know, follow me on Twitter, and stay tuned.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/03/saylor-microstrategy-offer-playbook-for-corporate-bitcoin-adoption-at-annual-summit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd66fe1fbc2914c9e45eaa11ce94f4c767c57519-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385899,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOpu9,1612390104,"Taproot Update: Bitcoin Users Home In on Activation Plan, Date Still TBD","Many of Bitcoin’s most active stakeholders have just about nailed down the activation method for Taproot, the Bitcoin software’s biggest upgrade in years.      In a public meeting on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Tuesday, Bitcoin developers, miners, business professionals and enthusiasts hashed out the specifics of how to package the Taproot upgrade into an update – and how to activate it once the code has been shipped.      The most active of the 200 or so participants on the chat (mostly, but not all, developers) seemed to agree on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that would be used to activate Taproot. To prep the BIP for shipment, they also voted to “merge” two “pull requests” (PRs) on GitHub that outline the rules for Taproot’s activation logic into Bitcoin’s source code when the time comes to push the upgrade.    Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Technology Across Bitcoin’s Software Stack    One of these, PR #1021, includes a measure to allow users to force activate the upgrade should miners not support it, while PR #1020 only “recommends” this forcing but does not enable it by default. Since most all participants support BIP 8 without forced activation, as meeting leader and Bitcoin Core developer Michael Folkson noted in the chat, further discussion will pinpoint a date to begin activation – and further discuss the extent to which a “flag day” to force activation is necessary.    Why a Taproot flag day (probably) isn’t needed    Not that miners blocking the upgrade should be an issue for Taproot, which has some 91% miner support, according to a survey run by Poolin VP Alejandro De La Torre.      The survey provides crucial feedback from miners for Bitcoin’s decentralized organization, which cannot unilaterally coordinate updates the way a centralized software provider can. Upgrades like Taproot require painstaking coordination between miners, full-node users (those running Bitcoin’s open-source code) and other stakeholders to ensure nothing goes wrong (like introducing a bug or splitting the Bitcoin network into two incompatible versions).      Because miners have shown no resistance to Taproot, most participants voiced a preference for BIP8 (false), with the (false) referring to the exclusion of a “flag day” to force activation through full nodes should the upgrade fail through lack of miner activation.      BIP8 as currently devised would give Bitcoin miners and full-node operators a year to adopt the upgrade, after which point the upgrade would be “locked in” with enough support. In one version of this, BIP8 (false), the update simply fails without enough support. In another, BIP8 (true), a “flag day” would force miners to signal for the upgrade when the activation time frame expires if they did not do so beforehand.    Read more: All Major Mining Pools Now Support Taproot, Bitcoin’s Biggest Upgrade in Years    Technical note: There are a few ways to upgrade Bitcoin, the easiest being through miner activation where mining pools upgrade and begin mining blocks under the new rules. Failing this, node operators can upgrade and choose to reject blocks from miners who have not signaled support for an upgrade. This so-called “user activate soft fork” (UASF), nearly used to activate SegWit, would force holdout miners to adopt the new upgrade.      “Completely anecdotal but I've not seen any [emphasis theirs] opposition to Taproot,” one willcl_ark said in the chat, referring to whether or not a flag day is necessary. “I think using the lowest common denominator of activation parameters (false) seems like the sensible choice to avoid any purposeful or accidental chain splits in the case miners don't signal.”    What’s the holdup?    Still others, like prolific Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, are not convinced the inclusion of a flag day is unnecessary. In fact, it’s a matter of principle to demonstrate that node operators decide software, not miners.      “It doesn’t matter,” he said in the chat in reference to miner support. “Miners do not decide protocol changes,” he continued, intimating that it’s the node operators who decide instead by choosing what software to run. Further, he espoused that BIP8 (false), “let[s] miners decide” the fate of the upgrade. When the time comes, he said later in the chat, he will configure his node to run the BIP8 (true) version that rejects non-Taproot blocks from miners.      “BIP8 with mandatory [activation] is not an unnecessary show of force,” said hsjoberg, reiterating Dashjr’s belief that the user-choice of a UASF is a necessary check and balance on miner apathy.    Read more: UASF Revisited: Will Bitcoin’s User Revolt Leave a Lasting Legacy?    Still, a show of force could introduce unnecessary risk and set an unwelcome precedent for future upgrade deliberations, especially when miners have given users no reason to be combative, so go the arguments in favor of BIP8 (false).      “[BIP8 false] is safer than [true], so it’s worth doing [false] first given that we know hashpower is ~90% already pro-Taproot,” Bitcoin Core and CoinSwap developer Chris Belcher said.      Others like Suredbits and Bitcoin Core developer Ben Carman pointed out that you could configure the upgrade later on into activation to include the flag day should miners fail to signal, “making it safer and easy for users to enforce the UASF.”      At the end of the meeting, the participants agreed to merge pull requests on GitHub for both a non-forced activation route (PR #1020) and a forced activation route (PR #1021). With both of these rules in Bitcoin Core’s GitHub, the rules for a forced activation could be used only if necessary.    More deliberation    The chain split scenario that willcl_ark described is basically the bogeyman everyone wants to avoid here. The fear is that BIP8 (true) requires 100% of hashrate to signal for the upgrade after the Taproot activation deadline ends. Thus, if enough users went this route at the same time that others use BIP8 (false) for non-forced activation (which only requires 95% of hashrate), the two different code versions may create two incompatible histories of Bitcoin’s transaction ledger.      That’s why, if forced signalling must happen at all, it’s best to do so through AJ Townes’ PR #1021, which “makes it safer for the UASF option which is the most ‘dangerous’ scenario,” Carman wrote in the chat.      For now it seems as if those involved in discussions favor BIP8 (false) with the addition of a UASF through PR #1021 if needed, but further discussion is needed to hammer out the exact timeline of the initial activation period (or how long users have to upgrade after the update goes live), as well as what activation date to set.      These “what ifs” and “whens” will be hashed out, among other matters, in a meeting on February 16.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/03/taproot-update-bitcoin-users-home-in-on-activation-plan-date-still-tbd,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a3618f3d058c0f6d015b1b64db85a39386bf320-2560x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The earnings are the payment giant's first since rolling out crypto buying and selling late last year. It removed the waitlist for BTC, ETH, LTC and BCH to all of its 350 million users on Nov. 12, 2020.      Customers who purchased crypto through the platform have been logging into PayPal twice as much as they were before buying crypto, the company said in its investor update.      PayPal's transaction revenue increased by around 12% from Q3 to $5.7 billion. The company also notes it will recognize transaction revenue from its crypto buys, sell and hold product, but it will not include transactions related to crypto in its total payment volume.      Notably, PayPal’s spending in technology increased year over year by more than 30% to $732 million.      “The volume of crypto traded on our platform greatly exceeded our projections,” PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. “We’re excited to build on this early success by allowing customers to use their crypto balance as a funding source. … We hope to launch our first international market in the next several months.”      PayPal has been working with regulators and central banks to shape the “next generation of the financial system,” Schulman added.      The company is also investing in its crypto business unit, Schulman said.      In response to an analyst question about possible acquisitions while digital asset prices are high, PayPal Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said that the firm’s appetite for acquisitions is a “multi-year” strategy, but that it’s in a good position to make one.      “We are unique in the fintech ecosystem as we enjoy outsized growth rates and are profitable,” Rainey said. “That allows us the ability to have this asset where we can look at inorganic opportunities to complement what we’re doing.”      PayPal’s network of merchants may be more valuable than the trading services it can offer, said James Friedman, senior fintech research analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group.      Crypto trading for other companies like Square (SQ) has not been “that profitable,” Friedman said.      “Basically, Square offers crypto as a service and they make the market but they don’t really mark it up,” Friedman said. “Trading is interesting but it’s not nearly as interesting to us as a payments acceptance device. … [PayPal has] incredible merchant volume.”      Because of how difficult it is to use bitcoin as a regular means of payment, Susquehanna, which is a market maker in PayPal securities, has been exploring the issue in surveys.      In December 2020, Susquehanna surveyed more than 120 small to medium-sized business owners to poll their interest in adopting bitcoin payments.      More than 70% of respondents said they would accept bitcoin for payment at checkout if PayPal or Square enabled it, but around half of respondents said they believed there would be no impact on their business if they added the feature.      More than half of respondents said the risk of fraud would be the main reason why they wouldn’t accept bitcoin for goods and services (as opposed to bitcoin volatility or tax issues).      Susquehanna also surveyed more than a 100 American adults on attitudes toward cryptocurrencies, current usage of cryptocurrencies and their likelihood to use them in payment transactions. They found that nearly half of respondents would not purchase a product or service with cryptocurrency, while 5.5% of them would do so 10 or more times per year.

Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $35,416-$37,245 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin was in its second day of a bull run, with the world’s oldest cryptocurrency going as high as $37,245, according to CoinDesk 20 data. It was changing hands at $37,092 as of press time.      “While BTC did break back below $30,000 very briefly during the period of consolidation over the last few weeks, the fact that it didn’t break down entirely is inherently bullish,” said Chad Steinglass, head of trading at CrossTower Capital.      Bitcoin has closed daily over $30,000 for over a month now. On CoinDesk’s candle charts, which shows a fuller picture of price orders in trading, every time bitcoin ducks under $30,000 it quickly picks back up.      Technical analysts often refer to this phenomenon as “support,” an area where traders have orders placed or will start buying in, usually because they feel a particular price point is enticing.      “There seems to be a solid institutional buying and technical bids just below $30,000 that gives some decent support which takes out the aspiring shorts,” noted Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner for investment firm Tellurian Capital.      Looking at liquidations, which are automated crypto leverage margin calls on derivatives venue BitMEX, it’s clear there has been a larger proportion of short versus long positions eliminated in the past few weeks.      Of the $1.1 billion in BTC liquidations the past month, $699 million of that tally, or 63%, have been short-oriented wipeouts.      CrossTower’s Steinglass says large buyers are helping maintain price levels and are now pushing them higher. “After the brief pop from the buzz generated by Elon Musk’s tweet and support, we are starting to see another round of institutional support led largely by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor,” added Steinglass.

Although bitcoin’s price Wednesday has not been seen since Jan. 28, Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, is cautious. “While we wouldn't rule out another poke back above $40,000, we think the balance of risk over the coming weeks actually leans more towards an expectation for a choppy consolidation phase than anything else,” Kruger told CoinDesk. “Medium- and longer-term technical studies confirm this outlook as they are still quite elevated following the parabolic run-up into January.”      One interesting development: Futures open interest on CME, a platform that caters to institutional investors, has dropped 29% to $1.7 billion since hitting an all-time high of $2.4 billion in open interest on Jan. 14.      This is a sign there’s likely less interest in bitcoin hedging – and perhaps BTC overall – while investors test other waters such as ether.      “We believe that when it comes to consensus and adoption in the cryptocurrency space, everything runs through bitcoin,” Kruger said. “(But) where traders who perhaps felt like they had missed out on bitcoin, they looked to take advantage of the trend by way of ether.”    Ether price frenzy spills into options market    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Wednesday, trading around $1,637 and climbing 6.6% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). It hit a fresh all-time high at around 19:00 UTC (2 p.m. ET) to $1,651 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      “Catching up on bitcoin's recent surge, it seems that there is room for ETH to grow and to try new all-time highs in the coming days and weeks,” noted Elie Le Rest, partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha. “With [decentralized finance] being a hot topic supported mainly by Ethereum technology and [with] ETH 2.0 moving forward, a significant ETH price surge throughout 2021 is highly anticipated.”      Read More: Sneaker App Switches From Ethereum to Hedera to Skip Blockchain Fees      The booming price of ether has stirred up options activity on bellwether venue Deribit, noted Greg Magadini, chief executive officer of data aggregator Genesis Volatility. “Traders are paying relatively more for the ‘speculative options’ in anticipation of bigger market moves,” he told CoinDesk.      Deribit’s launch of $10,000-strike ether contracts in January is an example of this; more than 8,000 ETH in calls at that strike price are open as of press time.      “These calls were recently released by Deribit and there is already a lot of activity,” Magadini told CoinDesk. “Quintuple-digit ETH prices are starting to enter the market's psychology.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all in the green Wednesday.

42385897,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOpqN,1612383770,China Leads Africa's Digital Currency Race,"In Africa, there is a race to define a digital currency standard for the emerging digital economy.      So far, we have three dogs in this fight, with no case of a pan-African central bank digital currency either live or at pilot stage.    Bitcoin, a form of decentralized digital currency with no issuer  Facebook’s libra, now diem, a privately issued digital currency  China’s DCEP, a digital version of China’s legal tender, the yuan    Out of the three, China’s DCEP from the People’s Bank of China is the leading contender because of a sneaky 20 year head start. Since the mid 2000s, China has discreetly accumulated significant influence over Africa's technology stack, close to 50% in the mobile handset and 70% in the mobile network layers.    Michael Kimani is a creator at Cryptobaraza, an experienced market builder of fintech, blockchain and crypto products in Africa.    Now, China can launch its digital currency on top of this stack, running on specially designed chips embedded deep within dozens of popular Chinese phone brands that dominate Africa.      China’s grand plan has three prongs: leverage its collective national and commercial influence, ride on Africa’s mobile payments success story and use its over 50% smartphone market share in Africa to distribute the DCEP. Huawei’s Mate 40, which launched in South Africa in October, is the first smartphone that enables a hardware wallet for the DCEP.    Africa's tech stack    Today, if you are browsing the web in Africa, much of the end-to-end internet experience is likely to have been built, serviced or financed by China.      It all begins with typical African digital native users on less than $2 per day. These users spend up to five hours daily on average on Whatsapp, Instagram or Boomplay, a music streaming app from China’s Transsion, Africa’s top phone maker.      Cheap Chinese-manufactured phones are the norm. Transsion manufactures Tecno and two other popular brands, Itel and Infinix. If it’s not one of Transsion’s phones, then it's one of a half-dozen Chinese cell phone brands. More than 50% of Africa’s smartphone users in East and West Africa are on Chinese-manufactured handsets.      See also: Michael Kimani - African Startups Should Tokenize to Break Biased Funding Cycles      When users connect to the internet, their data is routed through mobile networks, which are, more often than not, supplied, built or serviced by Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE. Sometimes procuring Chinese equipment is strategically packaged together with long-term intergovernmental financing at ultra-low interest rates from China EXIM bank or China Development Bank.      Such favorable vendor financing options, like grace periods on repayments of equipment, are responsible for kicking out Western competition, leaving firms like Huawei the lion's share of Africa’s leading mobile networks. Roughly 70% of 4G base stations in Africa are made by Huawei (the U.S., Australia and parts of Western Europe have banned Huawei equipment over national security fears).      I could go on about China’s involvement in a rapidly expanding network of undersea cables (which security analysts suspect has political purposes), or the government surveillance, data centers, smart city projects and terrestrial TV infrastructure in Africa linked to China. But the long and short of it is, China has pretty much subsidized Africa’s connectivity and this hasn’t happened overnight. It's taken 20 years to get to this point.    Original sin    In the last 15 years, mobile chip payments like M-Pesa have become the de facto digital standard for 400 million unbanked phone subscribers in Africa, whether that’s paying remotely or in-person payments for local commercial and social transactions.      When Africans are online and want to pay for content or services like Netflix, Tinder, Chrome or Google’s Play store, they are met by a bizarre request for credit card details; yet, what they have in their pockets is a prepaid mobile chip card.      Due to a historical combination of low penetration of bank accounts and a lack of formal credit history, adoption of credit cards to any meaningful levels was hampered.      See also: Geopolitics at Stake in US Response to China’s Digital Yuan: Report      So, rather than flog a dead horse, Africa’s mobile money operators repurposed the disposable SIM card, a tiny portable memory chip that stores mobile user information, to work much like the chip in a plastic credit card. After all, mobile phones were already in abundance.      Due to Western digital commerce norms, the only payment integration methods that exist are for credit cards. This leaves millions of Africans excluded from the global economy.      This is the original sin, and no one knows it better than Chinese app and venture builders. And they hope to align with the reality of Africa’s payment landscape.      Phone manufacturers like Transsion now build apps and invest in African ventures, riding on their distribution and infrastructure to pre-install Chinese apps before shipping to African markets.      Once in a while some apps and ventures are a massive hit, like Boomplay, a mobile app that streams African sounds to 50 million listeners across the continent.      Boomplay’s meteoric growth came on the back of strategic app pre-installations on Transsion’s brand of handsets destined for Africa. Despite its healthy growth, Phil Choi, head of international expansion at Boomplay, told Techcrunch that one problem stuck out like a sore thumb.      “... There isn’t really a sustainable or efficient mobile payment system. Processing payments takes really long and can be unreliable. For example, halfway through a transaction, errors may occur.”    With the power of distribution and its collective stack influence, China has worked out how to push a new digital currency standard.    Choi is right on the money. Africa is a fragmented mess: 200 mobile network operators, over 100 mobile money operators, 52 countries with different regulatory regimes and currencies, all at different stages of development.      Boomplay had little choice but to support multiple payment methods on a country by country basis such as Google Play Billing, debit cards, boom coins, Flutterwave, mobile money, Paga, M-pesa, IAP for iOS just to name a few.      Big Chief Asemota, one of Africa’s respected venture leaders, believes a shared local wallet standard would solve at least half of the problems of monetizing apps.    China’s grand plan    The Chinese plan is to embed a hardware wallet standard that supports digital currency into every smartphone shipping to Africa. Huawei’s Mate 40 is just the first smartphone to enable a hardware wallet for China’s digital yuan, the DCEP.      Back home, China is now trialling the DCEP with banks (including the Agricultural Bank of China) and cities such as Shenzhen. Internationally, China hopes its One Belt One Road trade initiative will integrate the DCEP, increasing efficiency and spreading China’s monetary influence across the world.      Phone manufacturers have been clamoring to ship smartphones embedded with chips that run cryptocurrencies and digital currencies like the HTC’s Exodus 1, and the Samsung Galaxy S20.      With the power of distribution and its collective stack influence, China has worked out how to push a new digital currency standard. Meanwhile, Facebook's diem digital currency and Satoshi Nakamoto’s bitcoin have ran into their own set of problems.      See also: Trading Bitcoin in Africa Is a Way for Some to Escape Poverty      Diem’s ambitions of banking the last billion in Africa have been dragged by a fragmented regulatory regime for mobile money, in addition to a non-existent framework for digital currencies. It was forced to go back to the drawing table.      Bitcoin, too, has encountered a similar adverse regulatory regime. Out of 39 countries analyzed by an Eco Bank pan-Africa research report, only two had a favorable stance. Despite this hostility, bitcoin’s decentralized features have resonated with Africa’s informal trading culture, finding fertile ground on peer to peer virtual markets. Informal trading has been the saving grace for bitcoin in leading markets such as Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya.      In this regard, China has the upper hand. Because of its political influence and debt obligations owed to it by African governments, Beijing has been pushing for a reserve currency status. Already 14 African central banks have considered adopting the yuan as a reserve currency, meaning that if successful, African central banks would hold renminbi just like they hold dollar reserves. This, too, would complement China’s digital currency efforts in Africa.      As I see it, the race has been run and China has won. It is only a matter of time before everyone sees it.

42385892,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOpk5,1612380701,"Ether Soars to Another All-Time High, Carrying DeFi and Rival Coins With It","It’s not just ether (ETH) that’s rallying to a new all-time high Tuesday. Also rising are major decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as well as cryptocurrencies of the very blockchains competing against the Ethereum system.      At press time, ether was trading around $1,637.21, up 10.32% in the past 24 hours. The price of the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization has continued gaining since it went above $1,500 for the first time on Tuesday.      Read More: First Mover: Bulls Are Back as Ether Hits All-Time High, Bitcoiners Hoard      According to research firm Messari, after ether went on a tear several DeFi tokens including chainlink (LINK), sushiswap (SUSHI) and aave (AAVE) followed the bullish trend, logging historic high prices Wednesday.      What’s more, prices for the cryptocurrencies of so-called Ethereum killers protocols also rose to new highs on Wednesday, including polkadot (DOT) and solana (SOL).      “Ether made a significant push [since Tuesday] and that is causing projects linked to the DeFi space – as well as DOT, which is seen as a potential ‘Ethereum killer’ – to appreciate and aim for new all-time highs,” said Hunain Naseer, senior content editor at crypto exchange OKEX’s research unit, OKEx Insights. “This is evident from the 24-hour gains of LINK, AAVE, SUSHI, yearn.finance (YFI) and DOT.”      Some of what’s driving the prices is more investors are starting to see value in the projects behind these tokens, so market excitement is building.      For example, Switzerland-based investment product provider 21Shares announced Tuesday it will soon launch an exchange-traded product (ETP) for polkadot. That news has led to “newfound” interest from buyers who are staking more DOT on exchanges, according to Pete Humiston, manager of Kraken Intelligence.      “In a sense, a positive feedback loop is beginning to form,"" said Humiston.      While the positive trading movement in ether and DeFi tokens were in part triggered by the WallStreetBets’s trading drama involving GameStop (GME) and other stocks, according to analysts, ether got a big push when digital asset manager Grayscale Investments said it was reopening its Ethereum Trust (OTCQX: ETHE).      Data from data firm Skew shows Grayscale added approximately 24,800 ether on Tuesday, then worth more than $37.8 million. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)      “The institutions are buying ether,” Ryan Sean Adams, founder of newsletter Bankless, wrote in a tweet. “And they’re just getting started.”      The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)’s new ether futures contract is launching this month, and many believe it will push even more institutional investors into ether after they took positions in bitcoin last year.",POSITIVE,DOT | ETH | LINK,DOT | ETH | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/03/ether-soars-to-another-all-time-high-carrying-defi-and-rival-coins-with-it,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42385905,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOq1h,1612373907,Blockchain Bites: MicroStrategy's Macro Strategy for Bitcoin Treasuries,"Three stories    1. Mining firms are benefiting from the market rally. California’s $441 billion public pension fund increased its stake in bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain (RIOT) nearly sevenfold while Ethereum miners are cranking out record revenue.    California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), the largest public pension in the U.S., held 113,034 shares in RIOT worth over $1.9 million at the end of 2020, according to Tuesday filings. That's up from Q3 2020, when CalPERS' 16,907 RIOT shares were worth a comparatively minuscule $49,000.  Meanwhile, publicly traded bitcoin mining company Argo Blockchain bought 172.5 BTC in January, amid soaring revenue. The new bitcoin stash is currently valued above $6 million.  Ethereum miners earned a record $830 million in January as network activity, fees and ether’s price all surged. Nearly 40% of total mining revenue came from network fees.    2. Industry experts are eyeing two bullish signs for crypto. First, balances of dai (DAI) and USD coin (USDC) on exchanges have hit lifetime highs, according to data from Glassnode. Meanwhile, Guggenheim research is placing $600,000 as a price target for bitcoin.    Rising stablecoin balances could prefigure massive buys into the crypto ecosystem. “New flows [to crypto markets] are coming from more mainstream institutions participating [that] have a strong predisposition for transparent, trusted, regulated dollar stablecoins,” Circle’s Jeremy Allaire told CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen.  While a six-figure price tag could be a ways away, Guggenheim Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd reversed his previous bearish comments to say bitcoin – if it follows the golden path – will attract large sums of institutional money.  Ruffer Investment Management, for instance, invested 2.5% of its $27 billion portfolio into bitcoin in November, and recently disclosed it took a $750 million profit on that deal, having sold approximately half its holdings at a market top around $40,000.    3. Trad meets crypto: Visa is working with crypto bank Anchorage to allow customers at traditional banks to ""buy and sell digital assets such as bitcoin."" This will come through a suite of application programming interfaces (APIs) for banks to plug and play into the crypto ecosystem.    “This is shifting to the next phase of Visa’s strategy where we’re looking at how Visa can also be a bridge between the thousands of financial institutions … and help them tap into the growing world of crypto assets and blockchain networks,” Visa crypto lead Cuy Sheffield told CoinDesk’s Nate DiCamillo.  Separately, investment firm Accelerate Financial Technologies has filed a preliminary prospectus for a new bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with Canada’s securities regulators.  At stake    The macro strategy More than 15% of the total bitcoin circulating supply has been moved to “accumulation addresses,” according to the latest accounting by data firm Glassnode. This figure is often cited to show how holders are bracing for the long term.      Standing at a 3.5-year high, some 80,000 BTC have been moved to these addresses. Accumulation addresses is an industry term for wallets with at least two non-trivial incoming transactions that have never spent funds, according to CoinDesk markets reporter Omkar Godbole.      This latest milestone comes as bitcoin continues to leave exchanges. As CoinDesk has reported before, coin inflows onto exchanges typically indicates a looming sell-off.      “The continued locking up of bitcoin has been creating a sell-side liquidity shortage led by increased institutional buyers and has aided the recent bull run,” Godbole wrote.      Indeed, major market players are accumulating bitcoin. In December, Grayscale added 72,950 BTC to its assets under management, far outstripping the 28,112 BTC mined during that same period. (Grayscale and CoinDesk are wholly owned by Digital Currency Group.)      Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, an intelligence firm that made a name for itself in 2020 for going all-in on bitcoin, continues to flesh out its bitcoin treasury. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, the publicly traded firm now holds a total 71,079 BTC, worth over $2.9 billion.      The company's CEO, Michael Saylor, has become an industry advocate and has argued that corporations should invest their cash holdings in the hard-capped cryptocurrency. He famously called fiat a “melting ice cube.”      Today, MicroStrategy is hosting a conference where Saylor intends to pitch his cohorts on the value of bitcoin investing. Saylor said he plans to go over his “playbook,” including accounting and legal guidance. CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson will be covering the event.      “We’re going to have thousands of executives, officers and directors and advisers of corporations coming together in the first week of February and they all want to figure out how to plug bitcoin into their balance sheet, their PnL,” Saylor told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" in January.      ""This conference could drive interest in bitcoin further, and even if that does not translate to immediate price gains it will definitely have a positive, long-term effect,"" Joe DiPasquale, the chief executive of San Francisco-based bitcoin and cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital, told Forbes.      Indeed, if Saylor’s pitch is successful, the industry could see a number of new entrants from institutional money. It’s a future that Guggenheim Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, among others, has predicted.      As others have pointed out, bitcoin is rapidly approaching a moment when no more coins will be minted (estimated in 2140). Casa CTO Jameson Lopp put it as such: “The final bitcoin will be minted incrementally over a period of 40 years.”      The rush is on.    Quick bites  INDIA INK?

42385900,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOpvP,1612372630,How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Technology Across Bitcoin’s Software Stack,"Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade is (basically) a shoe-in as Bitcoin stakeholders figure out the best way to bring it online.      Digital signatures are created from the private keys that control bitcoin wallets and are required to approve transactions. Taproot addresses will use Schnorr signatures, rather than Bitcoin’s current signature algorithm, the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, or ECDSA for short.      In terms of data and processing, Schnorr signatures are smaller and faster than ECDSA signatures and also have the added benefit of being “linear,” which means Schnorr-based smart contracts can be optimized for functions that ECDSA signatures cannot.      These differences have made Taproot a highly anticipated upgrade because it will give Bitcoin a boost to transaction privacy and allow for more lightweight and complex “smart contracts” (an encoded contract with self-executing rules).    Read more: Bitcoin’s Future: Exactly How a Coming Upgrade Could Improve Privacy and Scaling    The tooling and coding improvements Taproot brings will be largely under the hood and will be a boon to developers. Regular Bitcoin users, however, will also benefit from usability, performance, and privacy improvements to multisignature (multisig) technology, privacy software and even scaling tech like the Lightning Network.      Without Taproot, applying the following upgrades to these softwares would either not be possible or not be as viable.    MuSig2: Boosting privacy and efficiency of multisig transactions    Bitcoin development hub Blockstream is developing a new multisig software, MuSig2, which will make multisig transactions more efficient, cheaper and more private.      Unlike usual Bitcoin wallets, which only require a single signature from a private key, multisig wallets require at least two or more signatures from different private keys to approve a transaction. The idea is to distribute the risk of a wallet among multiple keys and, if needed, multiple parties.    Read more: Blockstream Is Working on Simpler, More Private Multi-Sig Bitcoin Transactions    Under the current design with ECDSA contracts, multisig transactions record the signature of each multisig participant individually. Schnorr signatures would allow each signature to be recorded as one signature on the blockchain, making the transactions more lightweight in data, and thus cheaper.      “[Taproot] benefits multisig wallets such as Blockstream Green because using MuSig2 is cheaper and more private than current multisig setups,” Blockstream researcher and applied cryptographer Jonas Nick told CoinDesk.      The Bitcoin upgrade will also raise the limit on signers a multisig wallet allows from 15 to a “much higher number,” said Bitcoin developer Chris Belcher.      Schnorr-signature based transactions are more private because, thanks to so-called scriptless scripts, all Taproot transactions have the same digital footprint. That means a single signature transaction and a multisig transaction look the same on the blockchain under Taproot’s rules.      This privacy improvement spills over into other areas of Bitcoin’s development, too.      “MuSig2 also improves efficiency of multi-party contracts such as Lightning Channels, CoinSwaps or discrete log contracts, and improves the privacy of routing in the Lightning Network by enabling ‘scriptless scripts.’ This also means that the anonymity set of regular transactions would become larger because, for a blockchain observer, it could just as well be part of a multi-party contract or multisig wallet,” Nick said.    CoinSwap: Disguising mixed coin transactions    All of the softwares Nick referenced rely on multisig wallets to bind market participants in cryptographically reinforced rules of engagement called smart contracts.      One of these, the privacy protocol CoinSwap, is widely considered to be the best successor to CoinJoin, currently the most popular software for “mixing” bitcoins to obscure their transaction history.    Read more: CoinSwap and the Ongoing Effort to Make Bitcoin Privacy ‘Invisible’    One shortcoming of CoinSwap’s precursors including CoinJoin is such transactions show up as distinctly different from normal ones. This makes it easier for blockchain analysis to pinpoint CoinJoins on-chain, thwarting any privacy benefits.      According to Belcher, Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade will fix this problem.      “A good benefit of Taproot is also that it allows scriptless scripts. As you may know, protocols like Lightning Network and CoinSwap depend on so-called hash time locked contracts. Currently these contracts are visible on the blockchain. The thing that scriptless scripts allows is for those contracts to also look exactly the same as a Taproot single-sig transaction.”    Point Time Lock Contracts: Making Lightning More Private    As Belcher points out, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network uses hash time locked contracts (HTLCs) to facilitate transactions. But Schnorr Signatures would pave the way for point time lock contracts (PTLCs), an improvement on HTLCs that allow for more private and efficient smart contracts for Lightning.    Read more: Lightning Network Overhaul Could Strengthen Bitcoin Privacy – But Many ‘Ifs’ Remain    The privacy gain comes from a modification to how Lightning Network nodes “route” transactions. Lightning transactions must be sent directly and peer-to-peer on what are called “payment channels.” Otherwise, lacking this direct connection, payments must be routed through peers to which both the sender and receiver are connected.      Lightning Network nodes route transactions by passing on a hash of the payment to each node on that payment’s path. PTLCs alter this hash by adding random info at each hop to make the payment less traceable to any party conducting blockchain surveillance.      Additionally, PTLCs will enable more complex smart contract logic to facilitate unprecedented blockchain escrow conditions and to improve oracles. (Since a blockchain can’t process data outside of its network, an oracle feeds this data to it.)      ""Technically, [PTLCs] could be done today with ECDSA but it doesn't have the same proven security, and if it was implemented it would have to be redone once we get Taproot,” Ben Carman, a developer at Suredbits, told CoinDesk.    Other Taproot improvements    Carman and his colleagues at Suredbits have been working on discrete log contracts (DLCs), a fairly new smart contract logic for Bitcoin that, while working today, will be more flexible and easier to use when Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade kicks in.      Belcher told CoinDesk that Schnorr signatures will also enable “batched validation” wherein a Bitcoin full node could “validate 1,000 Taproot signatures in nearly the same time it takes to validate one [ECDSA] signature.” This scaling solution would significantly speed the time it takes a node to verify all signatures in a block.      Additionally, Taproot could use “ring signatures” to give users the ability to prove they own certain coins without having to reveal the public key associated with those coins.    Read more: Bitcoin Miners, Developers Narrow Down How Taproot Will Be Activated    “That means someone could prove that they own a certain coin without revealing which exact coin. For example, it would be possible to prove you own at least 1 BTC (or any amount) by doing a ring signature over all the Taproot [unspent transactions] worth more than 1 BTC, and yet it doesn't actually reveal which is yours,” Belcher said.      This has implications particularly for Lightning Network node operators who want to prove payment channel ownership without sacrificing privacy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/03/how-bitcoins-taproot-upgrade-will-improve-technology-across-bitcoins-software-stack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fb1c744879d9d9dea87a75e1e31ff1614234726-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385894,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOplL,1612371950,CrossTower Launches Bitcoin Fund to Compete With Grayscale’s GBTC,"Crypto capital markets firm CrossTower, based in Bermuda, is launching a hedge fund at the end of the month in a bid to compete with Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and other bitcoin funds for accredited investors.      Similar to how Tesla’s boom created a larger demand for electric-vehicle stocks, the success of GBTC with $20 billion in assets under management (AUM) has caused a plethora of funds to follow suit, said crypto analyst Kevin Rooke. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)      Most recently, crypto lender BlockFi registered a Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Bitwise announced it was seeking regulatory approval to publicly trade shares of its bitcoin fund on an over-the-counter marketplace, similar to GBTC’s secondary market.      CrossTower Bitcoin Fund won’t trade in a secondary market, but it is trying to compete on management fees and liquidity.      The fund charges a management fee of 60 basis points, or 0.6%, compared to GBTC’s 2% management fee, said CrossTower co-founder and president Kristin Boggiano. It trades at net asset value (NAV) of bitcoin and has no lockups, letting investors redeem within a day.      “This is the most plain-vanilla of the suite of offerings that we expect to be popular,” Boggiano said. “We’re building infrastructure at CrossTower so that entities that want to shape their risk have different instruments whether they want to use an exchange, they want a loan, they want to go short.”    Read more: CrossTower Launches Capital Markets Desk to Bring Institutions to Its Spot Exchange    The minimum investment amount is $100,000 and CrossTower has $20 million in AUM from early investors to start. The product has seen the most interest from family offices, Boggiano added.      “That’s a definite huge perk for family offices,” James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in reference to there being no lockups on the fund. “It’s very unusual for a fund structured like this to offer daily liquidity.”      However, the initial AUM is on the low end of current offerings on the market, Rooke said. In late January, a Canadian investment firm completed a $180 million initial public offering for its crypto fund on the Toronto Stock Exchange.      CrossTower has hired Grant Thornton as the accounting firm for the fund, Apex as the administrator, Schulte Roth as the law firm and Anchorage as the custodian. (The fund eats the cost of custodial and legal fees, Boggiano said.)      It’s also a way for U.S. investors with offshore accounts to get exposure to bitcoin from foreign tax havens.      The fund is only offered to accredited investors and has a traditional master-feeder structure, which is an investment vehicle that allows CrossTower to pool capital from investors in the U.S. and around the world. Non-U.S. entities and companies with offshore entities can use the master fund to invest in a U.S. tax-exempt environment.      The fund is limited to 99 U.S. investors but is open to an unlimited number of offshore investors because of how the fund was structured for daily redemptions, Boggiano said. Other fund structures in Bermuda that are more capital-intensive would allow CrossTower to capture more of the U.S. market.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/03/crosstower-launches-bitcoin-fund-to-compete-with-grayscales-gbtc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f19fee725fd5aee8e3209b717a9ae633be577e3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385885,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOmTX,1612368510,Miami Mayor Previews 'Favorable' Crypto Policy,"Miami Mayor Francis X. Suarez wants his south Florida city to be a hub for crypto. Following in the footprints of crypto-forward pols in the U.S. states of Wyoming and New York, the Republican mayor is working on an ambitious set of rules and regulations to turn his beachside city into a teeming sandbox. A draft of these new rules could be revealed as early as next week, he told CoinDesk.      For months, Suarez has been courting the crypto industry as part of his larger call to attract technology firms and their capital to Miami. Faced with bloated rents but little city fun amid pandemic precautions, many white-collar workers in California's Silicon Valley and in New York City have decamped to other cities across the country. Miami’s particular draw: sunshine, warm water, and – of course – lower taxes. Soon it will add a comprehensive crypto policy added to that list.      “We're excited to be a trend‑setting city at the forefront of crypto and blockchain technology,” Suarez said over Zoom Tuesday, dialing in from his enviable ocean-view office. “We want to make sure that there is no city or state that has more favorable laws and regulations.”      This includes “making sure” there’s a regulatory environment for businesses to become chartered banks, like Kraken or Avanti, as well as welcoming crypto exchanges to operate in the city. Suarez said he’s looking at “Wyoming's legislative structure” – he’s been in touch with Caitlin Long, that state’s pioneer – and “New York's regulatory structure.”      “Imitation is the highest form of flattery,” Suarez offered, when pressed for details. The bill is still being written, though could be part of the legislative session beginning in March. That said, this type of regulatory broadside could be difficult to pull off in a month, even if sponsored by Senate and House representatives in the state. Suarez didn’t comment who these cosigners might be.      “Everybody has limited authority,” he said, adding, “I will meet with anybody. I will be happy to meet with [Florida's] governor about it.”      Suarez took office in 2017 as part of a political dynasty (his father Xavier held the same position). He said he had a “very close relationship” with Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, who put him on the state’s Blockchain Task Force. Part of the state’s Department of Financial Services, the working group looks to research potential blockchain applications for state use, including in record-keeping, data security and identity as well as recommend policy or strategic investments. It reports to the legislature and governor.      “I’m meeting with state legislators, which will ultimately create the laws that hopefully [the governor] will sign,” Suarez said.      See also: Jesse Powell - The Bitcoin Banker      At the city level, Suarez’s ambitions are equally ambitious. He’s “looking at” ways to pay municipal employees a percentage of their salary in bitcoin and allow residents to use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for “payments and fees,” including taxes.      Miami wouldn’t be the first governmental body to accept crypto for taxes, though under Suarez’s tenure it could become the first city to place a portion of its treasury in bitcoin. Again, details were scant, though Suarez said it’d likely take the form of a public-private partnership.      “We want to be a city that is the most cutting edge,” he said.      While a firm believer in blockchain technology, Suarez admits these policies are a play to attract the high-growth tech and crypto sectors, placing the city at the forefront of “American innovation.”    Snowbirds    The story began in December, after a prominent venture capitalist tweeted, “ok guys hear me out, what if we move silicon valley to miami.” Suarez replied, “How can I help?” It was a tweet that hit a nerve in Silicon Valley, where technologists were beginning to feel the sweat of a progressive government. At least 2.3 million people saw the tweet, based on organic impressions, a couple hundred retweeted it, and dozens of high-profile inventors and investors have taken up the clarion call.      Since then Suarez has been in non-stop conversations with people on and offline about moving to Miami or improving the city. This includes Valley-notables Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, soccer star David Beckham (co-owner of Inter Miami) and a host of pros from crypto.      He’s taken meetings with the Winklevoss twins of Gemini, Brian Armstrong of Coinbase as well as executives of bitcoin mining firms and assorted blockchain projects. On the day I spoke with Suarez, he ate lunch with early bitcoin advocate (and Florida native) Charlie Shrem. After speaking with the mayor, investor and podcaster Anthony Pompliano said he’d move to Miami for a few months.    We want to make sure that there is no city or state that has more favorable laws and regulations.    “There hasn't really been anybody that, assuming that they’re vetted, that I wouldn't meet with,” Suarez said.      “I've been impressed by his intellectual curiosity, along with his open minded approach to creating an environment for founders and investors,” Pompliano said over email. “It is a no-brainer for Miami to continue working to become the top crypto hub in the United States.”      This flutter of activity has pushed up Miami housing prices to record levels, despite the coronavirus pandemic. Asked whether the growth is sustainable, Suarez said it’s “incredibly sustainable. We have the ability in our zoning laws to grow 10 [times] … And not only that [because] we don't have the same capacity limitations that our cities like San Francisco have.” (Experts disagree about Miami’s sustainability, noting it may be one of the world’s most climate-endangered major coastal cities.)      The mayor says he's aware that bitcoin is used for money laundering. But then that's hardly new to Miami and he doesn't expect crypto to perpetuate the problem ""per se.""      The mayor is offering 20% discounts on mattresses for emigrating tech founders and he’s also pledged money for affordable housing. There are a lot of policies being considered, and I get the impression that many policies that are being announced or talked about on twitter won’t come to fruition – but Suarez is clearly serious about attracting tech and crypto talent.

As a financial holding company, Ant would be subject to capital requirements like those for banks, according to a Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter.  The group had previously proposed only including its financial segments in the holding company.  An official announcement on plan is expected before the start of China’s New Year holiday on Feb. 12.  The restructure is part of a Chinese government campaign to increase supervision of the fintech sector.  In November, Ant Group’s expected $35 billion initial public offering was suspended on both the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges supposedly due to changes in China’s regulatory environment for fintech firms.  Jack Ma, who founded Alibaba and its affiliate Ant Group, had been keeping a low profile since October when he criticized China’s financial system and its state-dominated banking sector at a Shanghai event.  Ant Group has its own blockchain, AntChain, building off it to launch a cross-border trading platform in September.

Dudas will start on Feb. 9 as a vice president and head of stablecoin business development, according to a Paxos staff memo obtained by CoinDesk. He will be responsible for expanding the company’s white-label business, which issues fiat-backed cryptocurrencies on other firms’ behalf (much like Duracell makes the Kirkland brand batteries sold at Costco stores).      “Paxos operates in the business segment that attracted me to crypto in the first place – payments and money movement,” Dudas wrote in the memo. “I believe every human should have access to money that moves instantly, affordably, 24/7/365 on modern infrastructure with strong security and settlement assurances.”      The firm’s ItBit exchange has assumed greater prominence in recent months, in no small part because it is the backend that powers PayPal’s (PYPL) mainstream-friendly crypto service.      More directly relevant to Dudas’ role, Paxos issues PAX, the fifth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization (the fourth-largest, BUSD, was launched in partnership with Binance). Collateralized by real-world greenbacks held at FDIC-insured banks, the token runs on the Ethereum blockchain and others, allowing for speedy transfers. Crypto traders often use stablecoins to move money quickly between exchanges in order to take advantage of opportunities that might disappear if they waited for a bank wire to go through.      Prior to founding The Block in 2018, Dudas worked in fintech at Google Wallet, Braintree/Venmo and PayPal, according to the memo. He also co-founded Button, a mobile commerce technology company, and worked at Disney, according to Crunchbase. Dudas stepped down as The Block CEO last spring.      “Mike clearly knows his way around fintech and has the kind of entrepreneurial spirit that we love,” Walter Hessert, Paxos’ head of strategy and business development, wrote in the same memo.      A one-time CoinDesk sparring partner, Dudas hinted at the role Monday in a tweet that he later deleted, as is his wont and, it should be said, his prerogative.      As for his continued involvement in the world of crypto media, Dudas told Paxos staffers he will remain The Block’s non-executive chairman, “where I have not been involved in day-to-day operations since April 2020,” he wrote. “I have never and will never be involved with editorial decisions at The Block, including its past and ongoing coverage of Paxos.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/03/the-block-founder-mike-dudas-takes-stablecoin-role-at-paxos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e266ecb7ca6d8473799c430548db9ebedb0bc981-1500x871.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42385882,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOmR1,1612363239,Bitcoin Startup Casa Raises $4M Led by Fidelity-Linked Avon Ventures,"Bitcoin self-storage startup Casa has raised $4 million in a seed round led by Fidelity Investments’ blockchain-focused Avon Ventures.      The investment comes with a board seat for Avon partner Sachin Patodia, Casa CEO Nick Neuman told CoinDesk. Tioga Capital, Castle Island, Cadenza, Champion Hill, Compound VC, Precursor, Lerer Hippeau and Coinbase Ventures also participated in the round.      Casa will put the funding toward improving the reach of its self-custody bitcoin wallet, anchoring a broader push to woo more users after a year of steady growth. Neuman said new Casa clients increased 325% in 2020 as revenue nearly tripled.      The company, which has raised $7.8 million to date, plans to continue its now year-old focus on building private key management software.    Read more: Bitcoin Startup Casa Names New CEO as Node Service Goes Open-Source    Private keys are decryption keys that give their holder control over the assets in a blockchain-based wallet. Every wallet has a private key, but some crypto services like Coinbase, hold those keys on behalf of their users, mitigating the risk of irrecoverable assets.      Third-party key management often makes a wallet experience feel similar to online banking and likely more accessible to newcomers because of it. But that model strips wallet owners of full control over their cryptographic assets.      “The point of bitcoin is that you optionally can choose to withdraw it from those financial intermediaries, which is much unlike the traditional financial system where you don't really have the option to ever withdraw,” said Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures.      Longtime bitcoiners such as Jameson Lopp (Casa’s chief technology officer) oppose third-party key holders on philosophical grounds.    Read more: Bitcoin Veteran Jameson Lopp Named CTO of Crypto Startup Casa    Neuman said Casa is trying to win new users with a self-custodied key management software that is easy to use and that reduces the risk of lost credentials.      “We're seeing people who have previously only kept their bitcoin on an exchange like Coinbase or they've even never owned bitcoin before, and they're feeling comfortable coming in and holding their own keys with Casa,” Neuman said, explaining the company’s self-hosted wallets.      Casa disclosed the raise at a time of heightened uncertainty for self-hosted wallets. Proposed rules from the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) unit would effectively de-anonymize self-hosted wallets that transact $3,000 or more. The rule, which is currently in an extended comment period, could deal a blow to the privacy appeal of self-hosted wallet service, if implemented.      Neuman said the round’s well-placed participant lineup gives Casa’s technology a “very strong endorsement.”      “It's really showing that some of the major companies in this space really believe that the philosophy of self-custody is important,” Neuman said. “One of the reasons why we're all here is because of the ability to have real true ownership of your assets.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/03/bitcoin-startup-casa-raises-4m-led-by-fidelity-linked-avon-ventures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/336743f78c53d04b5160b60dfd044bfac13cf97a-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dogecoin (DOGE) appeared to stabilize around 3.3 cents, which is still more than four times where it changed hands a week ago. The doggie-faced meme token, which is attracting socialmedia chatter, has been the object of price pumps at least five times since mid-2017.    Ether rises to new all-time high ahead of CME futures debut    Ether breaks $1,500: All eyes are on ether (ETH), the second-biggest cryptocurrency, after its price shot above $1,500 for the first time on signs of growing activity on the Ethereum blockchain. Prices, which quintupled in 2020, have more than doubled already this year, overshadowing the better-known bitcoin's 21% year-to-date return.      CME, the Chicago-based commodities exchange, is set to debut its new futures contracts on ether next week. That might generate additional buzz for ether, since the CME's bitcoin futures, listed in late 2017, have grown to become one of the most popular ways for big institutions to bet on the largest cryptocurrency.      Some analysts connected the move to the turmoil in stock markets: Online brokerages including Robinhood restricted transactions to rein in volatility fueled by Reddit-based retail traders’ coordinated buying in GameStop and other out-of-favor stocks.      ""The case for cryptocurrencies only grows stronger,” Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM Group, told CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole.

The tokens are also getting socked away in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.      Institutional buyers might be pushing prices higher: ""Either way, it's clear from the price that this diminishing supply is feeding through quickly to prices,"" Peters said in emailed comments. ""With institutions expected to add further to their positions, we expect the price of ethereum to push higher from here.""    GameStop comedown shows appeal of social-media-fueled trading    GameStop (GME) continued its slide: The stock tumbled 60% on Tuesday in what appears to be a comedown from last week's Reddit-fueled price pump. Other ""meme stocks"" AMC Entertainment (AMC) and BlackBerry (BB) also fell.      Virtual asset traders have kept a close eye on the saga. That's partly because the entire episode recalled the anything-goes culture prevalent in cryptocurrencies, but also because some of those fired-up retail traders might ultimately decide to give digital assets a try.      ""Looking at the charts today, it does seem like it's game over for GameStop,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, told his subscribers Tuesday. ""One lesson that the world seems to have learned is that social media can be a leading indicator, and even a driving force, for future price movements.""      Of course, the use of social media in trading is as relevant an issue to cryptocurrency traders as it is to the investors in traditional whose faith in stock markets might now be somewhat shaken: If the trading moves were coordinated among a huge number of individuals on a public forum, is it akin to a traditional pump-and-dump scheme?      U.S. securities regulators may find it difficult to bring a case. (Though the matter is under review by the Biden Administration, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, with both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives planning to hold hearings, as reported by CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De. Chinese regulators are also watching closely, CoinDesk's David Pan reported.)      Mark Cuban, the ""Shark Tank"" investor and basketball team owner, doesn't expect the new trading phenomenon to disappear anytime soon, he told CNBC Tuesday: “I think now that they’ve recognized their power and now that they’ve learned some lessons, we’re going to get more of it, not less of it.”      Some analysts are starting to connect the dots to cryptocurrency trading. Edward Moya, a senior analyst for the London-based foreign-exchange broker Oanda, wrote Tuesday in a market update that ""panic selling across GameStop, AMC and silver is triggering a nice bid on cryptocurrencies.""      Few crypto Twitterati would deny the role social media play in newfangled digital markets.      Indeed, the Reddit forum r/SatoshiStreetBets was filled early Wednesday with posts calling to pump dogecoin – a digital token created as a joke, with the adorable dog breed Shina Inu as its ubiquitous icon – ""to the moon"" later this week. There's even a song.    Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares look to cash in    With bitcoin up 21% so far in 2021 and ether hitting a new all-time high, digital-asset managers are rolling out announcements to take advantage of what they see as still-growing demand among investors for cryptocurrencies.    Bitwise Asset Management said Tuesday it's seeking U.S. regulatory approval to publicly trade shares of its bitcoin fund on the over-the-counter marketplace OTCQX. “There is significant growth in interest from professional investors in accessing bitcoin as a tool to hedge their portfolios against rising inflationary risk,” says Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer.  Grayscale Investments reopened its Ethereum Trust earlier this week to accredited investors. (NOTE: Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  Switzerland's 21Shares (formerly known as Amun) is launching the world's first exchange-traded product for the cryptocurrency polkadot (DOT), to be traded on the Swiss SIX Exchange under the ticker symbol PDOT. Prices for DOT have doubled this year, for a market capitalization of about $15 billion.  The investment firm Accelerate Financial Technologies is seeking approval from Canadian securities regulators to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund on the Toronto Stock Exchange, CoinDesk's Tanzeel Akhtar reported Wednesday.    The offerings come amid other signs of institutional demand for cryptocurrency-related investments, including the disclosure of a new $10 million bitcoin purchase by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR). The $441 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System, which is the largest U.S. public pension fund, disclosed Tuesday in a filing it held about 113,000 shares of the bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain (RIOT) at the end of 2020, worth some $1.9 million.      And CoinDesk's Muyao Shen reported Tuesday that balances of the stablecoins dai (DAI) and USD coin (USDC) on cryptocurrency exchanges had reached new all-time highs in the past week. Citing the blockchain data tracker Glassnode, Shen reported the increase might be a bullish indicator if it reflects buyers’ plans to use the two stablecoins to buy cryptocurrencies.    It's DeFi's time to scale, but kinks are everywhere    The furor over the trading platform Robinhood's stock suspensions in the wake of the GameStop saga is generating fresh interest in decentralized finance, where entrepreneurs are building automated exchanges and lending protocols atop blockchain networks. The idea is that the computer-run systems might be fairer and less prone to ad hoc human interventions in market operations.      Yet, the fast-growing industry is still working out its kinks.    Stakeholders in Yearn Finance, which acts like a robo-advisor steering users toward opportunities for earning high yields in DeFi protocols, voted this week to sell more tokens to raise money to compensate people who are working on the project as de facto staffers. The decision marked a clear shift for the team, which accrued a unique amount of buzz for eschewing the convention of setting aside governance tokens for insiders, CoinDesk's Brady Dale reported. ""Yearn's launch was exceptional at creating a decentralized and engaged community, but it did not provide adequate incentives to retain existing and future contributors on an ongoing basis, nor did it provide the protocol with a war chest to fund future activities,"" the proposal's authors wrote.  Ren, whose RenBTC has become the second-leading ""tokenized bitcoin"" in DeFi with a market cap of more than $500 million, is reportedly ""joining"" cryptocurrency entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda Reseearch, according to a blog post. But as reported by CoinDesk's Will Foxley Smith, the exact nature of the arrangement wasn't entirely clear. Bankman-Fried drew attention last year when he briefly stepped in to take control of the decentralized exchange SushiSwap. Ren said it plans to prioritize support for the blockchain Solana, which Bankman-Fried has supported. The blockhain's SOL tokens have nearly tripled in price this year, for a market capitalization of about $1.4 billion.  Manta Network, another DeFi project, says that while volumes are increasing on decentralized exchanges, they're also a ""hotbed for front-running opportunities,"" as reported by CoinDesk's Benjamin Powers. Manta CEO Shumo Chu said in an email that a recent survey showed that nearly three-quarters of the 404 respondents (73.2%) “have either hesitated or completely avoided making a transaction in the past because they were worried about the privacy implications of that transaction.”  Bitcoin Watch    Long-term investors continue to hoard bitcoin, sucking up market supply and helping the cryptocurrency maintain its broader upward trajectory, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole reports.      Data provided by Glassnode shows the total balance of bitcoin held in “accumulation addresses” rose to a 3.5-year high of 2,851,608 BTC on Tuesday. That amounts to 15.32% of the total circulating supply of 18,618,081 BTC. The number stood slightly below 14% three months ago.      Accumulation addresses are those that have at least two incoming non-dust transfers (tiny amounts of bitcoin) and have never spent funds. The metric excludes addresses active more than seven years ago to adjust for lost coins and those belonging to miners and exchanges.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/03/first-mover-bulls-are-back-as-ether-hits-all-time-high-bitcoiners-hoard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/019293f7735830abbcb9cdac5d45ee2fd2685bdb-1300x909.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385878,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOmLz,1612360844,"NFT Marketplace Rarible Closes $1.75M Seed Raise From 1kx, Coinbase Ventures","Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Rarible is building a “Uniswap for NFTs” and has fresh dough to get it done.      The token startup has raised $1.75 million from early-stage fund 1kx to broaden its decentralized market venue to include a new governance structure, co-founders Alex Salnikov and Alexei Falin told CoinDesk in a phone interview.      Rarible’s round was joined by Coinbase Ventures, ParaFi Capital and CoinFund, among others.      The new funds will be allocated for building out a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure for the buying and selling of NFTs on Rarible, the startup said in a press release. Funds will also be used for researching decentralized solutions for buying and selling NFTs.      “There’s no place to do that in a decentralized way. We are trying to build a decentralized approach, a Uniswap for NFTs,” Falin said.      Rarible currently supports two token standards, the ERC-1155 and ERC-721. Both are used almost exclusively in NFT markets while Ethereum’s burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) markets use the more common ERC-20 standard.    Read more: Yield Farming Expands From Finance to Digital Collectibles    Salnikov said the startup is also building out a “multi-chain strategy” and will “support several of them” in the near future.      The addition comes during a hot time for NFT markets. OpenSea, the premier platform for buying and selling tokenized collectibles, posted some $1.9 million in sales volume on Feb. 1.      “NFTs are entering a phase of interesting experimentation beyond their basic use cases, becoming a platform for permissionless innovation and unlocking killer uses that we cannot even imagine yet,” 1kx co-founder Lasse Clausen said in a statement. “Rarible is one of the best-positioned platforms in the ecosystem to promote and accelerate the open experimentation of NFTs.”      Rarible has recently garnered celebrity attention. Rapper Soulja Boy created his own NFT in his likeness followed by Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner Mark Cuban, who sold his NFT at auction for 30 ether (ETH) worth some $15,000.

42385881,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOmPl,1612357204,Rare Sneaker App Switches From Ethereum to Hedera to Skip Blockchain Fees,"SUKU, a blockchain startup that tracks luxury goods, among other things, is moving its high-end sneaker authentication system to Hedera Hashgraph because the fees on Ethereum became too high.      The first SUKU application to migrate to Hedera is called INFINITE, and it uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs), one-of-a-kind digital watermarks, to authenticate and enable easy secondary trading in limited-edition kicks, which tend to command prices of $2,000 and upward.      The sneaker authentication app has a physical NFT tag inside the shoe, combined with the unforgeable identity token. (It’s not the first time rare and valuable sneakers have been crossed with NFTs.) The cost of creating an NFT on Ethereum at current gas prices is over $80, as opposed to $1 to mint a one-off token on Hedera, explained Yonathan Lapchik, CEO of Citizens Reserve, the creator of SUKU.      “Don’t get me wrong, we love Ethereum,” said Lapchik. “But now we are getting a lot of users of the app and we need to make those fees as low as possible, and on Ethereum it really wasn't possible to scale.”      Lapchik said three sneaker authentication platforms, Legit Grails, Legit App and StockX, have been integrated into the INFINITE app. The secondary market in rare trainers is well established but it lacks the kind of digital titles that tend to accompany luxury watches, for example.    See also: French Fashion Brand Adds Blockchain Tracking to Clothes Made From Ocean Plastic    “We are really tackling the issue of tags that authenticate sneakers that really don't work nowadays,” said Lapchik. “If you have a pair of sneakers and want to resell back to the platform you got them from, or to someone else, you need to get them authenticated again. What we’ve built is valuable for secondary marketplaces but also for brands.”      The SUKU blockchain journey started some three and a half years ago, using a mix of Quorum, the privacy-centric fork of Ethereum designed by JPMorgan, as well as the public chain. SUKU continues to be enterprise-focused (its OMNI platform also does supply chain track-and-trace), and hence Hedera is well suited to the firm’s needs, said Lapchik.      Under the hood, Hedera uses a variation of distributed ledger technology that can handle very high transaction volume but isn’t really blockchain. The network is governed by the Hedera Governing Council, which includes firms such as Google, IBM and LG running nodes.      A key part of the migration, SUKU will be the first firm to leverage Hedera’s Token Service in a way similar to the non-fungible ERC-721 token standard on Ethereum, Lapchik said.      “We have created the same foundation that we have with ERC-721 and brought that to Hedera Token Service NFTs,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/03/rare-sneaker-app-switches-from-ethereum-to-hedera-to-skip-blockchain-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e85385ea8c6abbd3c944a01dd79669424013cc4-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s our public validator key:    0xad7fef3b2350d220de3ae360c70d7f488926b6117e5f785a8995487c46d323ddad0f574fdcc50eeefec34ed9d2039ecb    Now that CoinDesk is in the queue for validators pending entry into the network, we expect our operations to begin earning rewards in roughly two weeks. For real-time updates on the status of the CoinDesk Eth 2.0 validator, you can find that information on BeaconScan or beaconcha.in by searching for our public validator key.      This Thursday you’ll also be able to download and listen to our first podcast episode of the series “Mapping Out Eth 2.0.” We will be discussing in more detail how plans for the launch of CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 validator node came together with CoinDesk Director of Engineering Spencer Beggs.    New frontiers: Developers regroup on Eth 2.0    Ethereum 2.0 developers haven't rested on their laurels since the deployment of the Beacon Chain Dec. 1.      On Tuesday, Eth 2.0 researchers gathered online to regroup and discuss long-term thinking on sharding and a potential merge of the Eth 1.x blockchain and the Beacon Chain in 2021.      Presentations followed along three specific topics: the math needed to support sharding, sharding itself and a newer line of logic for moving along the eventual merge of Eth 1.x into Eth 2.0 called the Executable Beacon Chain.    Kate commitments    Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist provided Tuesday’s math lesson; it was a doozy.      Specifically, Feist gave an analysis of a polynomial expression known as Kate commitments (pronounced kah-tay) for Eth 2.0 client teams who may have to encode the math into their projects in the near future.      Also known as KZG commitments, these polynomial commitment schemes provide a computationally cheap yet robust framework for securing data across the 64 independent blockchains known as shards yet to be ingrained in Eth 2.0.  It’s thought that Kate commitments provide a superior alternative to fraud proofs or Merkle roots typically used for verifying the authenticity of data included in a block or shard, as Vitalik noted in a recent blog post.      Although still referred to as “magic math,” basically similar ideas are already being used for zero-knowledge proof schemes such as PLONK, Vitalik Buterin said on the call.    Sharding    The conversation then turned to a recent blog post written by Buterin on Data Availability Sampling (DAS), a schematic for verifying the “availability of high volumes of data without requiring any single node to personally download all of the data.”      In other words, how do validators know which block is valid if they don’t have all the information about the chain’s history? Nodes with only partial histories, such as light clients, need a method to protect themselves from malicious actors.      Buterin proposes using a technology called “erasure coding.” This tech – similar in a general sense to a fraud proof – allows validators to probabilistically guarantee that votes cast on data processed by the chain are not malicious. Moreover, erasure coding and DAS allow validators to accept or reject data even when a full data set is not available.    Executable Beacon Chain    Lastly, the group turned to a new proposal for moving Eth 1.x onto Eth 2.0.      Called the Executable Beacon Chain, the proposal is a technical method of taking the best parts of Eth 2.0 – its functional proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism – and the most functional part of Eth 1.x – its data execution also known as its ability to execute transactions – and mashing them together for an accelerated transition to a more-functioning Eth 2.0 network.      The current Eth 2.0 roadmap calls for transactions and account data (AKA executable data) to be implemented after the deployment of Eth 2.0’s 64 shards. This proposal would bake those functions right into the Beacon Chain itself, which would be quicker.      It’s comparable to a jet with Eth 1.x being the “engine” that processes transactions, while the Beacon Chain acts as the wings and rudder turning the network to and fro.      On the call, Ethereum Foundation researcher Guillaume Ballet and ConsenSys researcher Mikhail Kalinin described an early prototype called “Catalyst.” The model is basically a stripped down version of popular Eth 1.x client Geth paired with a code bridge to the Beacon Chain.      Yet, for now, Catalyst remains in testing. Indeed, Ballet noted a few significant hurdles before the Executable Beacon Chain is a viable merging solution, such as incompatibilities between Geth and the Beacon Chain or even inadvertent block re-organizations.    Checking the pulse of Ethereum 2.0    There are over 77,800 active validators on Ethereum 2.0 who are earning 0.0075 ETH per day, or roughly $11.47, on average. The combined income of all validators on Eth 2.0 over the last seven days amounted to over 4,600 ETH, worth over $6.8 million at time of writing.      It’s worth analyzing how these figures might fluctuate, given the continued inflow of new validators and the consistency of network participation rate upwards of 95%.      Validator rewards are positively correlated to the number of blocks being produced on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain. However, this number since Day 2 of the network going live has consistently been more or less the same at around 7,100 blocks.      Assuming the number of blocks produced per day doesn’t change, total validator rewards are also positively correlated to the number of validators participating on the network. The more validators there are actively progressing the Beacon Chain and producing new blocks, the more rewards in total are generated by the Eth 2.0 network.      However, the average amount of rewards in ETH an individual validator may receive on Eth 2.0 is negatively correlated to the total amount of stake securing the network. The higher the amount of ETH locked into Ethereum 2.0, the lower the amount of rewards an individual validator can stand to earn, even though collectively the total amount of rewards generated by the network to all validators has gone up.      To illustrate in more detail the competing forces acting upon validator rewards, I’ll be using the Staking Calculator on beaconcha.in to generate a few estimations of my annual percentage return as an Eth 2.0 validator.      Estimating Eth 2.0 validator returns      Assuming I am running my own independent validator operations without giving any percentage of my rewards to a staking-as-a-service provider, and a consistency of network participation rate at 97% and the total amount of ETH staked on the network as 2.5 million, I stand to earn 9.73% APR.      (Note: The total ETH staked on Ethereum 2.0 is not the same amount as the total ETH staked in the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract. The latter illustrated in the Pulse Check graphic is a higher figure that represents the stake of all Eth 2.0 validators whether pending or active, while the former only accounts for the stake of active Eth 2.0 validators who have passed the queue for entry into the network.)      It’s a highly unlikely assumption that the total amount of ETH staked on the network will stay at 2.5 million. New validators, each staking 32 ETH, are being added by the hundreds every single day to Eth 2.0. As such, a more realistic assumption is to expect the current total ETH staked on the Beacon Chain to double by the summer or fall.      At roughly 5 million ETH staked by 155,000 active validators, APR drops down to 6.88%, all other factors being equal.      One final note on this topic of validator income projections: I haven’t made any assumptions about ETH price. For all these calculations, I’ve used the spot price of ETH at time of writing.      While I’m confident in my estimations based on the last two months’ data in most respects (the network participation rate, the number of blocks produced, the number of active validators and what total ETH staked on the beacon chain will be in the near future), I’m not at all confident about my assumptions when it comes to ETH price, which lo and behold hit yet another all-time high on Tuesday above $1,500.

Data provided by Glassnode shows the total balance of bitcoin held in ""accumulation addresses"" rose to a 3.5-year high of 2,851,608 BTC on Tuesday. That amounts to 15.32% of the total circulating supply of 18,618,081 BTC. The number stood slightly below 14% three months ago.      Accumulation addresses are those that have at least two incoming non-dust transfers (tiny amounts of bitcoin) and have never spent funds. The metric excludes addresses active more than seven years ago to adjust for lost coins and those belonging to miners and exchanges.      The balance locked in accumulation addresses is up 22% year on year and has increased by 80,000 BTC in the past week alone.      The continued locking up of bitcoin has been creating a sell-side liquidity shortage led by increased institutional buyers and has aided the recent bull run.      Other on-chain metrics also back the bullish picture. For instance, the number of coins held in exchange addresses continues to slide, taking more sell-side liquidity off the market. The balance held on exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 BTC on Monday.      Bitcoin is currently trading near $36,220, representing a 1.92% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The cryptocurrency broke out of a three-week-long descending channel with a 6% rise on Tuesday.      The breakout implies an end to the recent pullback from the record high of $41,962 reached on Jan. 8 and a resumption of the bull run.

42385868,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOm9P,1612353600,Visa Signals Further Crypto Ambitions With API Pilot for Bank Customers to Buy Bitcoin,"Visa (V) is piloting a suite of application programming interfaces (APIs) that will allow banks to offer bitcoin services, the payments giant announced Wednesday.      The Visa Crypto APIs pilot program will let clients ""easily connect into the infrastructure provided by Visa’s partner, Anchorage, a federally chartered digital asset bank, to allow their customers to buy and sell digital assets such as bitcoin as an investment within their existing consumer experiences,"" Visa said in a press statement.      Visa envisions a product set that extends to other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as well as other crypto services such as trading, Visa crypto lead Cuy Sheffield told CoinDesk in an interview. Digital bank First Boulevard is the first bank involved in the pilot; Visa has issued a wait list for other banks.      Previously, Visa had been focused on helping crypto companies issue bank cards and has partnered with 35 crypto firms to date, but this is the first time the company has offered crypto services to banks.      Last week, Visa CEO Al Kelly said during an earnings call that stablecoins could be used for “global commerce,” adding that “to the extent a specific digital currency becomes a recognized means of exchange, there’s no reason why we cannot add it to our network.”    Read more: Visa May Add Cryptocurrencies to Its Payments Network, Says CEO  ‘Next phase’    “This is shifting to the next phase of Visa’s strategy where we’re looking at how Visa can also be a bridge between the thousands of financial institutions … and help them tap into the growing world of crypto assets and blockchain networks,” Sheffield told CoinDesk in an interview. “We’re excited to see what early tests and consumer engagement look like for things like dollar-cost averaging to buy bitcoin or for things like earning bitcoin back as rewards.”      Similarly, digital asset manager NYDIG tapped banking technology provider Moven to offer NYDIG’s APIs for buying, selling and holding crypto to Moven’s bank customers. Both products come in the wake of several letters from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency giving banks the green light to custody crypto and the ability to conduct payments and other activities with stablecoins.    Read more: NYDIG Taps Fintech Firm Moven to Bring Bitcoin to Your Bank    Visa’s news also comes after Anchorage became the first OCC-approved national crypto bank, although Sheffield said that Visa had been working on this product with Anchorage and regulators long before the custodian’s charter was granted.    Creating a Black crypto bank    The news also coincided with an announcement from Visa that it would be partnering with five Black-focused banks and fintechs to offer financial and business services that cater to the Black community.      First Boulevard, the first firm to join the Visa pilot, is a digital bank that is building tools to help African Americans passively build wealth and will launch sometime in early 2021. The bank plans on using the bitcoin services and its partnership with Visa to educate its customers about bitcoin as a way to close the general wealth disparities faced by Black communities, said Donald Hawkins, president and CEO of First Boulevard.      In the future, Hawkins said he hopes his customers come to the bank rather than YouTube for information about investing in crypto.      Currently, First Boulevard offers customers 15% cash back for spending at Black-owned businesses. In the future, Hawkins plans to allow bank customers to put those rewards into crypto investments or high-yield crypto savings accounts.    Read more: ‘Satoshi Was a Black Woman’: Blockchain Entrepreneurs Talk Financial Inclusion on Juneteenth    First Boulevard plans to partner with Visa on financial education in addition to using the crypto services plugins.      “Crypto is a gateway to financial literacy,” Sheffield said. “It’s much easier to get people excited about money and important concepts around investing by just explaining what bitcoin is.”      The bank also plans to offer resources for investing in real estate as well as micro-investing.      Normally, banks in traditional finance have to get buy-in from the board and management before making a play in the crypto space. At First Boulevard, jumping into crypto was “serendipitous,” Hawkins said.      “Our target market is Black Gen Z and millennial women,” Hawkins said. “The majority of our team is made up of exactly our target market. … So cryptocurrency has been a hot topic in our company since the very beginning.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/03/visa-signals-further-crypto-ambitions-with-api-pilot-for-bank-customers-to-buy-bitcoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

According to the exchange's page about the new product, Binance Pay, currently in beta, allows users to make ""contactless, borderless and secure"" cryptocurrency payments around the world.      “Binance Pay is a basket product which we do plan to spend a lot of effort on this year. We think that payments is one of the most obvious use cases for crypto,” said Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance, announcing the news at the virtual Binance Blockchain Week event Tuesday.      The Pay platform allows users to pay and be paid in five cryptocurrencies – bitcoin, ether, swipe (SXP), BNB and BUSD – and one fiat currency so far, the euro.      When CoinDesk asked Binance if it intends to add more payment options, a representative said more information on ""functionalities and plans"" would be released soon.      Users will need to top up their Binance Pay wallets (shared with the Binance Card wallet) in order to make payments. QR codes are generated when a payment is made that can be scanned by the recipient in order to receive their funds.

42385880,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOmNF,1612350640,ErisX Exchange Asks CFTC to Approve Sports Bet Futures as 'Risk Hedging' Tools,"Cryptocurrency derivatives platform ErisX is making an unusual attempt to push through futures contracts tied to the outcome of National Football League (NFL) games.      According to a report from Bloomberg on Tuesday, ErisX formally asked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in mid-December to give the green light to its gambling-linked futures.      Approval for three types of contracts on NFL games is being sought. One is based on the winner of a game, the second is based on the point difference scored by a particular team while a third is based on total points scored.      Because of differing laws across U.S. states around sports betting, sportsbooks have experienced major disparities in the amount of wagers drawn by teams. This has the potential to create an imbalance that leads to gambling venues having to pay out more to bettors than they take in.      Hinging on that fact, ErisX's proposed financial instruments are being touted as having nothing to do with betting, but rather as tools for managing risk. Their objective is to hedge against ""economic risk"" for sportsbooks, said ErisX's CEO Thomas Chippas in Bloomberg's report. ""This is not a substitute for gaming.""      See also: Fake Horses, Real Bets: Unikrn Is Putting Racetrack NFTs on Ethereum      If approved, trading of the NFL futures contracts would be open to sportsbooks, vendors and companies that agree to help set prices and participate as market makers, while individuals and hedge funds will be banned from participating.      Pending a 90-day review for public comment, the CFTC's response on the matter is expected around mid-March. If the exchange is given the OK by the regulator, professional baseball and basketball would likely be targeted next.      ErisX partner Jeff Ifrah, a criminal defense attorney with expertise in gaming law, is also helping ErisX's effort. Together, the exchange and the attorney, with the backing of influential CFTC lobbying firm Delta Strategy Group, have reportedly spent several months in discussions with the regulator's commissioners.      The CFTC has apparently questioned if the contracts “are contrary to the public interest,” and is casting a cautious eye over whether the products would fly in the face of the U.S. law against gaming contracts. The nation officially banned financial instruments associated with gaming in 2010.      See also: Bitcoin Derivatives Firm ErisX Adds Cash-Settled Contracts After Physically Settled Futures Fall Flat      The regulator is also trying to determine, via public comment, if the contracts proposed by ErisX could be used to manipulate the outcome of a sporting event.      “The only winner under this type of proposal are the casinos themselves,” said Les Bernal, national director of the U.S.-based advocacy group Stop Predatory Gambling, in the report. “It’s going to lead to citizens losing billions of dollars more money than they already are losing.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/03/erisx-exchange-asks-cftc-to-approve-sports-bet-futures-as-risk-hedging-tools,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d1ba81bee1d95d2bdde35fc614c78d9745d8163-1500x906.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an interview with CNN’s Julia Chatterley on Tuesday, Minerd said, based on Guggenheim's fundamental research, he believes bitcoin could eventually climb as high as $600,000 per coin.      Minerd said the firm has been looking at bitcoin for almost 10 years and previously the size of the market ""just wasn’t big enough to justify institutional money.""      However, as the total market cap of bitcoin got bigger – around the time bitcoin's price passed $10,000 – it started to look ""very interesting.""      “If you consider the supply of bitcoin relative ... to the supply of gold in the world, and what the total value of gold is, if bitcoin were to go to those kinds of numbers, you’d be talking about $400,000 to $600,000 per bitcoin,” he said.      However, the cryptocurrency's rapid rise in just weeks from $20,000 to $40,000 ""smacks of short-term speculation,"" he said.

According to a report from NBC Los Angeles on Wednesday, Natasha Chalk and her husband Marquis Hooper used their positions in the U.S. Navy to access, then sell, the compromised identities for a total of around $160,000 in bitcoin.      Prosecutors allege the couple intended for the stolen personal information to be used in crime related to identity theft.      Hooper, who was stationed in Japan at the time, was a chief petty officer with the Navy's Seventh Fleet, while Chalk was a naval reservist stationed at Naval Air Station Lemoore in California.      Last week, the couple were indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.      In August 2018, Hooper got in touch with a company storing millions of people's personal information and claimed to be conducting background checks on behalf of the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet.      However, it is alleged Hooper gave his wife and others, who were not named, access to the database account. Over the course of two and half months, the couple ran searches on thousands of people.      The illegally obtained personal data ultimately ended up being used in identity theft by the recipients, according to the indictments.      The couple's lawyer, Michael McKneely, argued the pair utilized ""commercially available databases"" used by everyday people and also added the action by the couple was ""clearly part of the scope of their work.""      See also: US Man Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Charges Involving $13M in Bitcoin      Prosecutors cite the case of an Arizona man who tried to withdraw money from a bank account using a fake driver's license that Hooper had allegedly found in the database.
