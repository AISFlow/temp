According to CoinGecko, the token is down more than 16% in the past 2 weeks. With the bears in control of the market, Polkadot’s short-term gains might be compromised. Related Reading: Cosmos Price Analysis: Why This Analyst Says ATOM Has ‘A Great Chart’ Despite showing that Polkadot can still pack a punch, users are still skeptical of the platform’s viability and DOT’s capability to move upward in the coming days. With low investor confidence and a seemingly overhyped feature, Polkadot might be in for a rough ride in the coming days. July: A Perfect Month For DOT? On a recent X post by the official Polkadot account, they shared July metrics for the platform which, all-in-all, showed great growth last month. The platform saw a 1.1k increase in unique voters on the governance side, with over 118 referenda on the platform.

Nevertheless, active developers have been flatlining on the platform. According to its recent data, the number of active developers every week has stagnated at 900 in July. In a post made by Polkadot Head Ambassador Alice und Bob, they detailed a problem that has been plaguing the ecosystem for a while now. Inflation is caused by OpenGov spending more than it earns, because they just print more DOT to make up the difference. To solve inflation, reduce wasteful OpenGov spending. Your tax DOT should be spent well, not poorly. https://t.co/20wq07eZPR — Alice und Bob 🥐 (@alice_und_bob) August 17, 2024 “Inflation is caused by OpenGov spending more than it earns, because they just print more DOT to make up the difference. To solve inflation, reduce wasteful OpenGov spending. Your tax DOT should be spent well, not poorly,” they said on the post. The sentiment is shared by some members of the community, stating that the spending of OpenGov is problematic and should face some cutbacks to help the community. Some even went as far as commenting on the recent posts on the Polkadot account. Polkadot Down From Crucial Support On This Level DOT will seem to continue its downward spiral in the long term as the bears break through the $4.61 support level that the bulls tried so hard to hold on to. This represents a large setback for investors and traders which compounded the overall sentiment of skepticism within the community.

32527032,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636115,1723929087,"Ethereum Price Wobbles As Inflation Sees 210,000 Added To Circulation","Recent market dynamics have again brought Ethereum’s supply into the spotlight and reiterated concerns about its inflationary trend. Earlier this year, Ethereum reached a significant milestone in its circulating supply, surpassing 120 million ETH and the number continues to grow. Unlike other prominent cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Cardano, which have fixed supply caps, Ethereum was designed with an unlimited supply of tokens. This fundamental difference makes Ethereum an inherently inflationary asset, one that has a continuously increasing supply. On-chain data from Ultrasound.money has shed light on the growing supply of ETH in recent months amidst notable price fluctuations for the cryptocurrency. The most recent data indicates that the total supply of Ethereum has now reached approximately 120.28 million ETH. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Says God Candle Will Send Price To $57 Over the past seven days alone, 16,039 new ETH tokens have been issued. This pace of issuance corresponds to an annual inflation rate of 0.70%. Interestingly, this data shows that 243,886 ETH has been created in the past four months since the Dencan upgrade in March. What Does This Mean For Ethereum? Ethereum’s inflationary mechanism is mostly counteracted by burning tokens. This burn mechanism was introduced as part of Ethereum’s London Hard Fork in order to introduce a deflationary mechanism to Ethereum. This mechanism aims to reduce the overall supply of ETH by burning a portion of the transaction fees, thereby introducing a deflationary counterbalance. However, data from Ultrasound.money shows the burns are currently lagging behind issuance, and Ethereum is now on an inflationary trajectory. Particularly, 2,028 ETH were burned in the past seven days, compared to 18,075 ETH issued in the same timeframe. Such a sustained uptrend in supply growth could cause downward pressure on the price of ETH in the case of a decline in demand. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,615 with no significant gains or losses in a 24-hour timeframe. Looking at a broader seven-day price action shows Ethereum has largely traded within a range of $2,750 on the upper end and $2,530 on the lower end. The latest price action saw Ethereum rebounding at $2,540 in the past 12 hours. If this continues, Ethereum could possibly push up and retest $2,750 in the next few hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Further Decline As Bearish Death Cross Returns According to the latest figures from Greeks.live, approximately 184,000 ETH options are set to expire today. These options represent a substantial nominal value of $470 million and are characterized by a put-call ratio of 0.8 and a maximum pain point of $2,650.

This shows that investors believe RUNE has long-term potential once the effects of its latest developments are reflected on the platform. Related Reading: Despite A Stormy Market, Dogecoin Addresses Skyrocket To Over 6 Million Word has recently spread that ThorChain might be integrated with OKX in the future. This significantly changed investor outlook on the platform as integration with OKX, a major centralized exchange, will be a big factor for RUNE’s movement in the future. Big Things To Come In The Future For RUNE According to X user Rayyk, the OKX has been using ThorChain infrastructure to facilitate transactions in recent months. Metrics-wise, OKX’s use of Thorchain is primarily in swaps, making the latter a vital part of OKX’s swap volume. In Rayyk’s thread, OKX and ThorChain’s swap volume reached 20 million within just one week, showing ThorChain’s reliability despite the high volume. ThorChain’s capabilities in swaps involving Bitcoin complement OKX’s support for Bitcoin-based features like ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Word is out that @THORChain may be integrated into the @okxweb3. This is huge because it is backed by @OKX, one of the top 3 CEX by volume.

When asked about Tron’s possible integration, he replied: “Look, all I can say is a Telegram chat has opened, and once a Telegram chat is open, it is a group chat, it’s getting done.” RUNE Will Continue To Rise Because Of These Factors RUNE is currently on a great support level as it continues to rise amidst the bullishness the market is experiencing.

32521652,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636182,1723914014,PEPE Selling Pressure Surges As Price Slips Under $0.00000766 Support,"Recent trading activities reveal that PEPE is under mounting selling pressure as its price falls below the critical $0.00000766 support level. This dip signals a further bearish move, with bears gaining control and eyeing further downside towards the $00000589. The break below this key level raises concerns among traders, as the possibility of deeper losses becomes increasingly likely. As momentum turns negative, this article aims to examine the implications of PEPE’s price slipping below a critical support level. It will delve into how this breakdown impacts market sentiment, and with the help of key indicators evaluate the likelihood of further declines. In the past 24 hours, PEPE has declined by 3.51%, reaching approximately $0.00000724. Its market capitalization stands at over $3 billion, with a trading volume exceeding $652 million. During this period, PEPE’s market cap and trading volume have decreased by 3.62% and 0.26% respectively. Market Sentiment Shifts As Price Falls Under Crucial Support PEPE’s price is exhibiting active bearish behavior, trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the 4-hour timeframe. Since falling below the $0.00000766 support level, the crypto asset has remained steady, showing little sign of recovery. This sustained price action under a key moving average suggests that bearish momentum is firmly in control. As a result, the downward trend could likely extend further, especially if the price continues to struggle below this critical resistance level. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that PEPE could continue its decline toward the $0.00000589 support level. The signal line has fallen below 50% and is now trending around 37%, suggesting that bearish pressure remains strong in the market. On the 1-day, PEPE is still trading below the 100-day SMA and the trendline. It can be observed that the crypto asset is attempting a bearish move toward the $0.00000589 support level. With this recent bearish move, the decline could extend to other support levels. Lastly, the formation of the 1-day RSI suggests that PEPE is at greater risk of extending its decline. The signal line is currently hovering around 35% after failing to break above 50%, setting the stage for another drop toward the oversold zone. Potential Downside Targets: Where PEPE Could Be Headed Next Ongoing bearish pressure could push PEPE’s price down to the next support level at $0.00000589. A decisive break below this support could signal further bearish movement, potentially driving the asset toward the $0.00000566 support level and possibly even lower. However, if PEPE rebounds from the $0.00000589 level, it could retrace toward its previous high of $0.00001152. If the cryptocurrency breaks above this level, it could signal further upward momentum, potentially targeting the $0.00001313 resistance range and other higher levels.

Experts are highly optimistic about SOL, and crypto analyst Alan Santana once showed his doubt over the token by stating that it might be due for a heavy fall. Related Reading: Cosmos Price Analysis: Why This Analyst Says ATOM Has ‘A Great Chart’ Divergent View On The Stability Of Solana Solana has been impressive regarding the stability within this wild market. A crypto expert named Jelle has echoed the same notion as he referred to the wonderful chart of SOL and explained how this digital asset could reach $260. His explanation showed that SOL was easily creating higher lows compared to struggling giants such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This resiliency, considering a range-bound movement just below its record high, suggests that SOL could be in for a breakout. $SOL is still one of the better looking charts in crypto. Sideways chop, just below all-time highs — no lower lows despite #Bitcoin & $ETH struggling over the recent months as well. Locked in, send this beyond $260. 📈 pic.twitter.com/AHtmKdfQWO — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) August 16, 2024 This stands in great contrast to what Santana expressed. His analysis brought out a repetitive trend in the price history of Solana. He gave examples of SOL having short-term surges in price—two to three weeks—then sharp drops. This has happened multiple times before, and now, as it seems Santana reckons such a pattern is in the making again. Potential Downturn And Key Levels He said it’s possible that SOL could return to its January 2024 trading range. According to him, most altcoins, including Ethereum, are already returning to the baseline prices amid this year’s market correction. He said Solana could do the same, thus making it revisit its January lows, or even lower. ✴️ Solana RSI & MaCD, Jan. 2024 Baseline &, 2-3 Weeks Bounce Then Drop!

This week is only starting, soon to be halfway through.… pic.twitter.com/D7FezL117N — Alan Santana (@lamatrades1111) August 13, 2024 It is based on historical patterns and key price dynamics. Essentially, Santana’s analysis states that despite the current SOL stability and optimistic projections, there could be a major pullback ahead. The possibility thereby adds some risk to investors banking on SOL as a stable bet in the current market. The Debate Over Solana’s Future These opposing views of Solana’s future reflect a general uncertainty within the cryptocurrency market. If Jelle is bullish about SOL, assuming a heavy price surge, Santana stands on the other side with his bearish outlook, suggesting caution. This contrast between the analyses symbolizes the greater unpredictability of the crypto space. These competing opinions show that Solana remains at the center of market volatility. Since the market is poised for volatility, it will be interesting to see if Solana breaks out for $260 or continues the fall. The ball is rolling, and Solana’s next moves will determine its fate. Related Reading: Despite A Stormy Market, Dogecoin Addresses Skyrocket To Over 6 Million Investor Caution And Market Dynamics For the moment, the debate on Solana price action does reflect broader uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market. Investors and traders are required to keep their guard up to balance the views that exist for both a bullish and bearish view of the situation. As this situation develops, Solana will be part of such performances that could see its price going either way.

32516415,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636122,1723899609,"Bitcoin Market Facing A Persistent Net Sell-Side Bias, Glassnode Reveals","Following a tumultuous start to the month, the cryptocurrency market has yet to shake off the early August blues. The story has not been very much different for the price of Bitcoin, which struggled to make an impact in the past week. With BTC’s price almost 20% adrift of its all-time high of $73.737, there have been increased calls for the premier cryptocurrency to return to the bull market. Interestingly, a recent on-chain observation shows that Bitcoin has witnessed substantial bearish pressure in the past two years. Bitcoin Spot CVD Persists In The Negative — What Does This Mean? In a recent post on the X platform, blockchain data company Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin spot market has been experiencing a net-sell side bias over the past two years. This on-chain observation is based on the Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) indicator, which measures the net difference between buying and selling trade volumes. Related Reading: MATIC Set For Rebranding In Early September: Will Polygon Prices Recover After Sinking 65%? The Spot CVD metric is used by investors to assess the current market sentiment. It offers detailed insight into whether the bulls or bears are the dominant market participants. Typically, a positive Cumulative Volume Delta value implies more buying pressure in the market, while a negative value suggests that the sellers are in control. According to the latest data from Glassnode, the yearly median CVD value has been bouncing between -$22 million and -$50 million over the past two years. This trend suggests a net sell-side bias, with selling volume overshadowing buying volume in the spot market for some time now. While the persistence of a net-sell side bias suggests investors offloading their coins rather than accumulating, it does not necessarily imply a bearish condition for the Bitcoin market. It rather spotlights a cautious approach by the investors, with an overall decline in spot demand of BTC. Although it is difficult to say how the spot Cumulative Volume Delta will shift over the coming months, the metric is one that investors should look out for. This is especially relevant because a return of CVD to positive values could signal an increase in Bitcoin spot market demand, which could be favorable for the Bitcoin price. BTC Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin is slightly above the $59,000 mark, having increased by more than 2.5% in the past 24 hours. This recent momentum, though, is not enough to wipe off the coin’s loss on the weekly timeframe. According to data from CoinGecko, the Bitcoin price is down by more than 2% in the past week.

32513676,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636125,1723892434,Bitcoin Spot-Perpetual Gap Points To Continued Selling Pressure – Analyst,"The month of August has been largely uneventful for Bitcoin so far, with the premier cryptocurrency having struggled to reclaim the $65,000 price mark since August 2. Currently, Bitcoin is slightly below $60,000 as the bulls and bears seek to grab control in what has been a range-bound market for the past week. Interestingly, CryptoQuant analyst XBTManager has shared revelations that indicate the BTC market is likely to maintain its current bearish form for the time being. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears in Control? Record Low Funding Rates on Binance Signal Market Shift Wide Spot-Perpetual Gap Spells Trouble For Bitcoin On August 16, XBTManager reported that Bitcoin’s Spot-Perpetual Price Gap, as tracked on the Binance exchange, is continually in a negative form indicating that the asset may record more price loss due to a sustained selling pressure. For context, a Spot-Perpetual Price gap occurs when there is a difference between the valuation of Bitcoin on the spot market which deals with the asset’s actual price, and on the perpetual markets which allow traders to deal in speculations of the Bitcoin’s future price. When the perpetual price is lower than the spot price as in the current case of Bitcoin, it indicates traders are massively offloading the asset in the perpetual futures market as they believe there could be an incoming price fall. Expectedly, XBTManager predicts this negative spot-perpetual gap will translate into a heightened selling pressure in the spot market as several traders will look to sell their assets and buy in the perpetual market thus taking advantage of the arbitrage to gain some profit. In the advent of such a reaction, deep liquidation hunts might occur i.e. where a large number of leverage positions are forcefully closed down, leading to a larger negative Spot-Perpetual Gap, and increased selling activity. However, XBTManager has noted a potential positive for Bitcoin in this uncanny situation. The analyst states that high selling pressure will likely result in an accumulation of multiple short portions on Bitcoin. Therefore, the instance of a sudden price gain might force these positions to close leading to some significant buying activity that could reduce the current negative Spot-Perpetual Price gap.

On one hand, the number of Dogecoin addresses has been increasing. On the other hand, the recent technical analysis gives less reason for optimism over the short to medium term. What must investors make of this dual narrative? Related Reading: Cosmos Price Analysis: Why This Analyst Says ATOM Has ‘A Great Chart’ Dogecoin Rising Adoption: Silver Lining Data from the latest charts on Crypto Daily Trade Signals reveal that the number of Dogecoin addresses with a balance has grown to 6.56 million, up 20% from eight months ago. Such an adoption swing indicates that more people are holding on to their DOGE for further gains. This has developed into a strong vote of confidence in the cryptocurrency while its price has been unable to gain traction. #Dogecoin Addresses Hit 6.56M IntoTheBlock’s addresses metric highlights a continued increase in the total number of Dogecoin addresses with a balance. In the last eight months, addresses in the ecosystem grew 20.1% to 6.56 million from 5.43 million. Dogecoin price decline since… pic.twitter.com/A3im2BrcV0 — Crypto Daily Trade Signals (@cryptodailyTS) August 16, 2024 This optimism, however, is somewhat offset by several short-term indicators. According to IntoTheBlock, the price of Dogecoin has been trending down despite the steady increase in active addresses. The Fear & Greed Index currently rests at 25, which translates to “Extreme Fear,” a direct indication that the market is in a state of worry. This often leads to increased selling pressure, further depressing prices. Bearish Short-Term Forecast: Should You Be Worried? Technical analysis by crypto price prediction platform CoinCodex indicates further bearish action in the immediate future for Dogecoin. It is estimated that by September 16, 2024, Dogecoin will drop by 14% to a price target of $0.087023. This is supported by the fact that over the past 30 days, Dogecoin has only spent eight days positive, indicative of its downward trend. The price volatility has been high at 11% over the last month, indicating extreme swings in prices and uncertainty in the market. This kind of volatility at these levels, along with such extreme fear in the market, further indicates that there may be more downward pressure on Dogecoin in upcoming weeks. In that case, this may not be a good time for one to invest in DOGE. Contradictory Signals: What’s The Real Story? The contrast between the rising number of Dogecoin addresses and a bearish price forecast is rather puzzling. On one hand, the growing user base could be viewed as an ultra-bullish sign: more interested people and prospects for further development. On the other hand, negative technical indicators and fearful sentiment of the market cast a shadow. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin (DOGE) Headed For A 40% Slide? This Analyst Thinks So A falling wedge that usually has a bullish bias in price action has dominated Dogecoin recently. Though this is the case, considering market conditions, such a breakout looks unlikely in the near future. In the setting of the resistance at $0.11, analysts are not very sure that it shall be reached due to the existing bearish sentiment. Dogecoin is in a mixed-signal situation at the moment. While the adoption continues to increase, the short-term technical analysis leans bearish. The Fear & Greed Index, coupled with the recent price performance and high volatility, is all indicating that the market does not favor Dogecoin at this point.

Signs Point to Yes, Says Top Analyst","XRP, being one of the worst year-to-date performers among the top 10 largest crypto by market cap, now appears to be on the verge of a historical rally, according to renowned crypto analyst Javon Marks. According to Marks, XRP’s latest price action suggests a major turn in its trajectory, reminiscent of its monumental rise observed from 2016 to 2017. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Says God Candle Will Send Price To $57 XRP: Dissecting The 50,000% Rally Outlook Javon Marks, in a post on X earlier today, highlighted potential signs of a major bullish surge for XRP, similar to its ascent from roughly $0.0066 to over $3.30 years ago. Marks points to what he describes as a “Hidden Bullish Divergence” on XRP’s chart—a technical indicator suggesting that the current price movement is an anomaly and that a significant price increase could soon follow. Notably, a bullish divergence often occurs when the price of an asset makes a new low, but the momentum indicator starts to climb, suggesting that the downward trend is losing its strength and could reverse. $XRP is still, right now, showing signs that mirror its 2016-2017 action where prices soared nearly +50,000% from ≈$0.0066 to over $3.30!

Marks stated in the post, indicating strong confidence in the asset’s imminent market behavior: This means that can be on the cusp of witnessing another extraordinary unimaginable performance and showcase of strength from XRP and Ripple, unfolding in ANY MOMENT now. History may not always repeat exactly, but it often rhymes, and the ‘songs’ that XRP and Ripple are ‘playing’ can be carrying some of the greatest lyrics. Touching On The Ripple And SEC Saga The backdrop to XRP’s potential market resurgence, as highlighted by Marks, is framed by its legal battles and regulatory challenges, particularly with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The protracted legal confrontation, initiated in December 2020, accused Ripple Labs of selling XRP as an unregistered security. After extensive legal proceedings, a federal judge recently ordered Ripple to pay $125 million—a fraction of the $2 billion initially sought by the SEC—effectively bringing a significant portion of the litigation to a close. This ruling, delivered in July 2023 by Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York, found that while Ripple violated securities laws in its direct institutional sales, it did not break the law in its dealings that put XRP onto exchanges accessed by retail investors. Related Reading: XRP Price On The Edge: Can It Survive and Start Fresh Increase This partial victory for Ripple has been viewed favorably by the market, as it provides a clearer regulatory framework moving forward and may reduce the uncertainty that has clouded XRP’s potential. According to Marks’ outlook, this just might be what XRP needs to finally make that major rise.

32505750,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636112,1723872650,Wall Street Titans Boost Crypto Stakes: US Bitcoin ETFs Garner $2.4B In Q2 Inflows,"The crypto market continues to be influenced primarily by broader macroeconomic conditions, with the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report providing a glimmer of optimism for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Crypto Awaits Fed’s Move According to a recent Coinbase report, the slightly softer-than-expected July CPI print of 2.9% year-over-year – the lowest level in three years – has “calmed market concerns and reinforced expectations of impending Fed rate cuts at the September 17-18 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Per the report, this has been viewed as positive news for risk sentiment, as it may help dispel fears of a potential US recession, which Coinbase believes is more important than the total size of Fed cuts this year. Related Reading: MATIC Set For Rebranding In Early September: Will Polygon Prices Recover After Sinking 65%? However, the crypto market has remained range-bound, with Bitcoin (BTC) unable to break through the $61,000 level. Sentiment has slowed due to a lack of crypto-specific catalysts, and perpetual futures funding rates in BTC have turned negative this week, potentially indicating lower trader activity. In the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, gas prices have slumped, which could signal a decline in network activity. On a more positive note, spot Ethereum ETFs in the US have seen inflows this week. ETF Inflows Signal Strong Institutional Interest The report also highlighted the growing institutional adoption of crypto, as evidenced by the latest 13-F filings for US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The data, which captures the state of institutional ownership as of June 30, 2024, reveals notable new holders such as Goldman Sachs ($412 million) and Morgan Stanley ($188 million). The ETF complex saw net inflows of $2.4 billion during this period, despite a drop in total assets under management (AUM) from $59.3 billion to $51.8 billion, due to Bitcoin’s price decline from $70,700 to $60,300. Nonetheless, Coinbase analysts believe the continued ETF inflows during Bitcoin’s underperformance may be a “promising indicator of sustained interest in crypto from the new pools of capital that the ETFs give access to.” They also expect the proportion of investment advisor holdings to increase as more brokerage houses complete their due diligence on these funds. Related Reading: Silk Road Bitcoin Are ‘Almost Certainly’ Sold By US Gov, Claims Lawyer Looking ahead, the report notes that the stage is set for market dynamics to be tested at the upcoming Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, a pivotal event that could sway sentiments and shape the trajectory of crypto markets. While short-term fluctuations and market slowdowns may dampen immediate enthusiasm, Coinbase highlights the underlying currents of institutional interest and the evolving landscape of ETF inflows that paint a promising picture for crypto prices for the rest of the year.

32503626,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636104,1723867243,"Brace For Impact: Ethereum Price Could Plunge To $1,200 In December, Says Expert","Ethereum (ETH) price has struggled amid another market shakeout. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell below the $2,600 support zone for the third time in the past week, prompting crypto analysts to evaluate the next levels to watch out. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Poised for Inflation? Supply Reaches New High as Staking Takes Off ETH’s Key Support Zone To Watch Out The crypto market has seen several retraces throughout the cycle, with cryptocurrencies like Ethereum significantly decreasing from its Q3 opening. Since July 1, the “king of altcoins” has seen a 24% drop from the $3,400 support level. Following its fall below the $2,100 mark during the ‘Black Monday’ crash, ETH has hovered between the $2,300 and $2,700 range. The cryptocurrency has recovered around 18% of its price while tries to reclaim the $2,600 level. Nonetheless, the recent market shakeouts have made the price retest the strength of the $2,500 support zone three times in the last two weeks, which turned experts wary of ETH’s next step. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that investors should pay attention to a key support zone after Ethereum’s performance. To Martinez, the $2,300 and $2,380 price range should be watched if ETH continues its downward trend. According to the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) chat shared by Martinez, 1.62 million addresses bought over 50 million ETH at this zone, making it the next wall of support for Ethereum’s price. If the cryptocurrency fails to hold this level, its price could drop to $2,200 and even levels not seen since February. Will Ethereum Drop To $1,200 This Year? Other experts have suggested that the second-largest cryptocurrency could see its price drop even lower, as “even giants will fall.” Top analyst Benjamin Cowen stated that the “collapse of ETH/BTC” is almost completed. A year ago, Cowen forecasted that the collapse of the trading pair would “mark the end of the altcoin reckoning.” He explained that “altcoin reckoning” refers to the devaluation of the altcoins on their BTC pairs. The analyst added that ETC/BTC was the “last one to rise in the bull and it can be the last to fall in the bear.” To him, this trading pair has four more months before it goes up next year. Additionally, Cowen predicted that Ethereum’s price could hit the $1,200 price range in December if its performance is similar to the last two cycles. Crypto investor Ted Pillows urged investors to hold on throughout the troubled waters, suggesting that a $10,000 is still possible. To the trader, the ‘King of altcoins’ is not dead based on different factors. Ted highlighted that spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) inflows have increased while Grayscale outflows have progressively gotten smaller, and Jump Trading has only around $60 million in ETH to sell. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin (BTC) Trade Back Above $70,000 By September? Analysts Weigh In Moreover, ETH is “strongly holding its support level,” which he deemed the most important factor. Ultimately, the investor Predicts that the consolidation breakout will occur between November and December, while the “parabolic run” will start in Q1 2025.

32501523,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636116,1723861841,"Can Solana Replicate Ethereum’s Run To Reach $1,000? Expert Answers","A crypto market expert has expressed bullish optimism for Solana (SOL), predicting that the cryptocurrency is currently on track to replicate Ethereum’s historical rise to new highs. As a result, the expert foresees SOL hitting new all-time highs of $1,000 this bullish cycle. Solana Sets Sights On $1,000 On August 12, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Kaleo’ on X (formerly Twitter) shared his optimistic expectations for Solana’s future outlook during this bull market. Kaleo observes that the Solana’s price chart was currently replicating a pattern previously seen in Ethereum in late 2020. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Further Decline As Bearish Death Cross Returns Comparing Solana’s market movement with that of Ethereum at the time, the analyst disclosed that SOL may be following a similar growth trajectory to Ethereum’s past performance in the last cycle. He noted that Ethereum had experienced a significant price increase in 2020, eventually reaching new all-time highs. Based on Solana’s current price movements, Kaleo predicts that the cryptocurrency could reach a reasonable target of $1,000 during the present bull market. This potential price increase is rooted in the assumption that Solana will mirror Ethereum’s bullish price action in the previous cycle. Since the beginning of the year, Solana’s price performance has been notably bullish, witnessing significant price surges that have pushed it as high as $200 at some point. Although the cryptocurrency has experienced its fair share of price declines, recording a more than 9% drop over the past week. As of the latest update, the price of the cryptocurrency is trading at $143.6, marking a 0.48% increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Given Solana’s relatively strong price fundamentals amidst market volatility, crypto analysts continue to express bullish expectations for the altcoin. A crypto analyst identified as ‘Crypto Jack’ has noted that Solana is steadily approaching critical resistance levels. He predicts that if the cryptocurrency breaks above $190, it could be poised for an explosive rally to the upside soon. Analysts Double Down On Solana’s $1,000 Bull Rally Sharing similar bullish projections with Kaleo, a crypto analyst recognised as ‘Crypto Curb’ on X has revealed new price targets for Solana. According to Curb’s post, Solana is set to experience a steady price increase before reaching a new high at $1,000. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Says God Candle Will Send Price To $57 Sharing a price chart of Solana’s movement from 2021 to 2024, the analyst disclosed that SOL has been consolidating between the $120 to $210 mark for the past 170 days. During this time, the cryptocurrency was seen bouncing between monthly support and resistance levels. Curb predicts that once Solana emerges from its ongoing consolidation phase, the cryptocurrency is likely to see a substantial upward movement. He anticipates a rapid climb to the $400 to $500 range first, followed by an even larger increase to between $800 and $1,000 or more.

The bearish sentiment also extends to shorter time frames, with ADA recording losses of 4.1% in the 24 hours, 10% in the past two weeks, and a staggering 30% in the last month alone. This showcases investors’ bearish sentiment in the token, coupled with the broader market fears and lack of bullish momentum that has embroiled ADA’s price in a significant bearish phase. However, not all hope is lost for Cardano enthusiasts. Potential Upside For ADA’s Price Crypto analyst “Trend Rider” suggests that the current price action presents an opportunity for investors to capitalize on potential upside. The analyst points to a critical level of $0.69, which, if breached, could signal the beginning of an uptrend for ADA. The analyst stated: Yes, the price action is undeniably weak right now, but this isn’t about conceding defeat. Instead, let’s use this moment to our advantage by identifying key levels where ADA could make a strong comeback. The critical level to watch? $0.69. This marks the entry into an uptrend channel. The last time ADA broke in here, it skyrocketed from $0.02 to $3. Related Reading: MATIC Set For Rebranding In Early September: Will Polygon Prices Recover After Sinking 65%? Despite the analyst’s optimism, the path to the $0.69 level appears challenging for ADA. The token has encountered a significant obstacle at the $0.3538 mark, which has prevented a surge to higher levels and tackled the token’s 200-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), represented by the yellow and blue lines on the daily chart, respectively. These key technical indicators have previously been crucial support for the ADA price. Still, since the market-wide correction that began in April, the token has been trading well below these EMAs. Consequently, in the near term, the price must surpass the $0.3856 mark, where the 200-day EMA is currently placed, before any potential short-term uptrend materializes. At the time of writing, the ADA price stands at $0.3251.
