42400824,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL1uZ,1515018920,SEC Seeks Comment on CBOE Bitcoin ETF Filings,"The SEC is asking for public comment on two proposed rule changes that, if approved, would lead to the listing of the first-ever bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds.  Released by the SEC on Dec. 28 and Jan. 2 as a way to solicit public input on the proposals, the new documents make public proposed rule changes put forward by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) that would exempt its proposed bitcoin ETFs from certain market manipulation rules. Submitted in two filings, on Dec. 15 and Dec. 19, the rule changes relate to advisors and brokers that would seek to support the products when launched.  The two documents would allow Cboe's exchange to list a total of four ETFs.  Under current regulations, advisors to a company managing funds must have a ""firewall"" between any brokers or dealers they might be affiliated with. This wall would prevent the advisor and the broker from sharing information about the company's portfolio. Other rules disallow anyone who manages a fund from using insider information to increase their funds' worth.  In the documents, Cboe asks for exceptions to the rules because it does not believe bitcoin can qualify as a commodity at risk of being manipulated under the same rules as some existing ones are, noting that price manipulation would require a bad actor to influence the entire blockchain worldwide.  Similarly, due to the nature of the bitcoin network, and its broad, global infrastructure, it would be difficult for any person to have insider trading knowledge on it, the filing claims.  It reads:  ""There is [no] inside information about revenue, earnings, corporate activities or sources of supply; manipulation of the price on any single venue would require manipulation of the global bitcoin price in order to be effective; a substantial over-the-counter market provides liquidity and shock-absorbing capacity; bitcoin's 24/7/365 nature provides constant arbitrage opportunities across all trading venues; and it is unlikely that any one actor could obtain a dominant market share.""  That said, it still remains to be seen whether the current procedure will clear the way for Cboe to list any bitcoin related ETF products. As reported previously, past attempts at launching a bitcoin-based ETF have met with failure, with the SEC rejecting some filings or forcing other companies to withdraw their filings.  To date, the regulatory body has not approved any bitcoin-based ETFs, though whether the SEC will continue to reject the filings is unclear given that now two different futures products are on the market.  As part of the public comment, the SEC will accept both email and written messages for three weeks after the filings are published in the Federal Register.

42400810,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL1li,1515012013,Judge Dismisses Long-Shot Bid to Overturn New York Bitcoin Regulation,"The New York State Supreme Court has granted a motion to dismiss a years-long lawsuit that tried to overturn a technology-specific regulatory regime that targeted cryptocurrency, a newly released document shows.  Theo Chino, a former bitcoin entrepreneur, sued the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) in October 2015 over the regulation, often referred to generally as the ""BitLicense."" Officially introduced in June 2015, the policy requires bitcoin-related firms that reside in the state to apply for a license to operate.  Chino accused the agency of over-regulating the bitcoin industry, claiming the restrictions it imposed overstepped its ability to regulate companies using the technology. He further claimed that NYDFS's regulations forced him to shut down his own business.  After an initial delay on a decision, the court granted the defendant's motion for dismissal, throwing out the notable one-man fight that tried to overturn a state-wide introduced regulation.  In a media statement sent to CoinDesk, Chino's lawyer said that while the court has decided Chino has no standing to challenge the BitLicense regulation, he plans to file an appeal to the New York State Supreme Court.  It further stated:  ""Obviously, our client disagrees with this conclusion, since it would mean that, for all practical purposes, no business located in New York or in another state would have access to the court system to challenge this regulation, and possibly other regulations promulgated by NYDFS.""  The dispute mainly stemmed from the controversy that arrived with the introduction of BitLicense. Entrepreneurs complained that the license enforced too many regulations, as well as imposed high compliance costs.  As previously reported by CoinDesk  , in addition to the $5,000 non-refundable application fee for the BitLicense, legal fees and time allocation could result in several thousand dollars spent. Cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp, for example, estimated at the time that one company could spend up to $100,000.

42400806,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL1kj,1515006930,RBC Report: Crypto and Blockchain Could Unlock $10 Trillion Market,"A research analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) sees cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and decentralization as a potential $10 trillion ecosystem.  In a new report released Wednesday, Mitch Steves, an equities analyst with RBC's Capital Markets subsidiary, laid out his bull case for why the future of transactional services will ultimately be decentralized. ""While the cryptocurrency space has many risks, the opportunity appears vast with constant technology updates,"" he wrote.  Though startups that enable cryptocurrency protocols to serve as decentralized alternatives to proprietary services or as a means of transmitting remittances have garnered the most interest throughout the ecosystem's formative years, Steves argues that the protocol layer (on which these services will be built) is where most of the value will be realized.  ""We see that the protocol layer will capture more value than the applications,"" he wrote, adding:  ""As the application becomes successful, the protocol layer captures more value, which then creates more interest in additional decentralized application development.""  As such, the comments echo the fat protocol theory put forward by Union Square Ventures, which states value creation on decentralized cryptocurrencies will occur at the lower infrastructure layers.  The report also asserts that the market for cryptocurrency mining is here to stay, arguing that there currently exists an at least $4.2 billion market for bitcoin mining equipment with an additional $350-$450 million for other ASIC-mined cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash and another $1.9 billion market for GPU-mined coins like ethereum and monero.  Notably, the report argues that decentralized technology in its current state is misunderstood and underrated, claiming that cryptocurrencies are becoming better able to handle an increasing number of transactions. In particular, Steves sees the Lightning Network as a tool to enable more than a million transactions per second on bitcoin.  Still, scalability, along with government intervention and the creation of more sophisticated wallet hacking techniques, was identified as one of the key risks facing the ecosystem.  Continued progress on these fronts, however, will be a boon for the development and mainstream adoption of a global supercomputer, whether it be ethereum-based or on an alternative, provided that blockchain’s impeccable security record remains spotless, Steves said.  “As scaling and protocols mature, the value of a decentralized world computer could potentially become a multi-trillion dollar industry,” Steves wrote, concluding: ""If there’s one positive technology item we can agree on, it’s that the blockchain has never been hacked. What happens if we build on top of this secure layer?""

According to data site CoinMarketCap, XRP has climbed more than 21% in the last 24 hours, hitting a price of $3 just after 17:00 UTC today. Ripple’s rally comes after hitting a temporary low of $2 immediately following its previous all-time-high of $2.85 on Dec. 30, 2017, according to CoinMarketCap.  Still, XRP is up 144 percent on the week, and more than 1,000 percent month over month. The cryptocurrency was trading at $0.26 just over 30 days ago. With the change, XRP is also bringing a shake-up to the leaderboard of the most valuable cryptocurrencies.  At press time, XRP has heavily increased its lead over ethereum, long the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. While just 24 hours ago Ripple had a $17 billion lead, that figure has now increased to $26 billion. Ripple passed ethereum in market cap less than a week ago, and has been holding the number three spot on Dec. 29, 2017.  As Ripple has climbed, so too has the overall cryptocurrency market, with the total market cap surpassing $713 billion just a day after it climbed past $667 billion.  On the day's trading, 15 of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap are in the green, with ethereum classic, Qtum, EOS, iota and bitcoin offshoot litecoin being the notable exceptions.

42400809,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL1jk,1514998762,RSK Beta Brings Ethereum-Style Smart Contracts Closer to Bitcoin,"RSK is launching its bitcoin smart contracts platform in beta today.  Formerly known as Rootstock, the startup has long been lauded for its potential to pave the way for the implementation of ethereum-style smart contracts on bitcoin, something enthusiasts believe will keep the world's largest cryptocurrency competitive with the platform that arguably pioneered the idea that more complex self-executing code could be run on a blockchain.  But while it would be easy enough for bitcoin users that want more complex smart contracts to merely make the switch, some users believe that, as bitcoin is the largest and most secure cryptocurrency, more experimental features that debut on other networks will eventually make their way to its network. The idea is that in doing so, they can capitalize on bitcoin's impressive startup infrastructure and serve different users.  Yet, RSK's version of the functionality doesn't quite upgrade the bitcoin blockchain itself. The capability will rather be brought to bitcoin via a sidechain, which moves tokens from the main bitcoin blockchain to a compatible network operated with the help of 25 companies.  Still, RSK CEO Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar believes the advance will effectively provide the same level of utility to potential users.  He told CoinDesk:  ""This is the first time that there's going to be a smart contract platform powered by the bitcoin network.""  Like ethereum's implementation, RSK's sidechain will use a Turing-complete language and issue blocks roughly every 10 seconds.  A controlled sidechain  In this way, RSK's ""federated"" sidechain is also a notable workaround to the difficult process of changing bitcoin's code (most recently seen during bitcoin's scaling debates).  But that difficulty comes because one small change can have technical repercussions on other parts of the system, so much so, that changing a blockchain's rules is often compared to tearing out and repairing the engine of an airplane while it's flying. Because of this, developers have long sought to make it easier to use more experimental technologies on bitcoin with so-called ""sidechains,"" which pin newer blockchains with innovative technical features to bitcoin.  Users can then test and try these new features by moving money onto the sidechain.  Yet, because merge-mined sidechains, at a technical level, are not ready for primetime, RSK developers are relying on a group of companies – known as a ""federation"" – who collectively control the money put into the sidechain (the original dream of sidechains is moving money back and forth between the main bitcoin network and the sidechain without trusting anyone).  RSK developers and business partners have been running experimental smart contracts on the testnet for some time. And currently, they are the only ones who can access the so-called ""smart bitcoin"" (SBTC) needed to run smart contracts on the sidechain.  According to RSK co-founder Gabriel Kurman, this is for security purposes.  ""The network will still have limited access until we finalize the onboarding on most of the bitcoin miners and federation members,"" he said.  And adding to that, RSK head of business development Henry Sraigman, said, ""We expect to open the access to the general public as soon as we complete the onboarding of the RSK Federation members and we add more hashing power to the network in the coming weeks.""  Continuing interest  That said, the mainnet launch is still a big step for bitcoin and one that many in the community will likely greet with enthusiasm.  In addition to the 25 companies that are part of RSK's federation, Zaldivar said that bitcoin's miners have ""expressed interest"" in being involved. More than half, he claims, are working with RSK right now.  ""The idea is to start on the mainnet, strengthening the security of the platform, and hopefully by May, we can announce the production version of the mainnet,"" he said.  According to RSK executives, they're hoping the company's previously-announced bug bounty program, which rewards developers in cash prizes of up to $5000, could be a part of driving better security on the platform. And as an open-source project, a ""global community"" will be able to vet and test the platform.  And while no one knows how long it will take for trustless sidechains to be implemented on bitcoin, Zaldivar, for one, is optimistic, telling CoinDesk:  ""It's already solved. We hope to have it by 2018 – the sooner the better – but, as everything in bitcoin, security should be first.""

Ewald Nowotny, head of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Austria's central bank, said in an interview with German paper Sueddeutsche Zeitung that anyone who participates in a financial transaction should be clearly identified, on top of paying value-added tax (VAT).  According to the Daily Mail, the banker also expressed concerns about potential uses in money laundering, saying:  ""It can't be allowed that we've just decided to stop printing 500-euro notes to fight money laundering, that we've slapped strict rules on every tiny savings club, and then have to watch people blithely laundering money around the globe with bitcoin.""  Nowotny's comments come just days after ECB executive board member Benoît Cœuré told Caixin Global that bitcoin is in a bubble. Like his Austrian peer, Cœuré said one of the main concerns surrounding bitcoin relates to tax evasion and money laundering.  Cœuré continued to say that bitcoin was supported mainly by speculation and ""there is a risk of large capital losses which investors should be aware of.""  Both bankers declared that bitcoin is not a currency, with Cœuré adding that investors would not be able to use it as a means of payment.  However, he did say that distributed ledger technology (DLT) in general shows promise for wholesale and retail applications, noting the ECB's recent joint venture with the Bank of Japan to research use cases for the tech.  While central banks worldwide are looking into how to use DLT to update or replace existing financial systems, the technology is still too young for any meaningful implementation, he said.

The complaint was filed by a group of plaintiffs that contributed more than $20 million in cryptocurrency – with a current estimated valuation of $100 million – during the project's token sale in July and August. In return for their contributions, investors were to be issued either Giga Watt tokens that would grant them exclusive rights to use the company's facilities rent-free for 50 years, or mining equipment and supplies to be deployed and set up by the on-site project team.  Asserting that construction deadlines have not been met and promises to refund contributions have not been honored, the plaintiffs are seeking the return of their investments.  The filing states:  ""Many investors [who] have not been issued their Giga Watt tokens or had their machines set up and deployed, fear that they might never be issued their tokens or see their mining machines activated, and are losing valuable time and money as defendants indefinitely delay the further development of the Giga Watt Project.”  Founded by well-known bitcoin miner Dave Carlson, Giga Watt aspires to democratize the mining process by creating customized turnkey mining ""pods"" along with a cheap and stable electricity supply and round-the-clock maintenance at a facility in central Washington.  While the startup worked with the law firm Perkins Coie prior to launch to ensure the tokens would not be considered securities, the plaintiffs are claiming that tokens issued for a pre-functioning network are, by their very nature, securities that must be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or granted an exemption before they can be sold.  A representative at Perkins Coie declined to comment when contacted by CoinDesk.  Filed in U.S. District Court in Eastern Washington, this case – and others, including suits filed against Tezos – could provide an important barometer for how U.S. courts will treat tokens that will have future ""utility,"" but are issued before a functioning network is in place.  ""Just because utility tokens might one day have a consumptive use does not remove them from being a 'security' prior to that use,"" argued David Silver, a partner at Silver Miller in south Florida, who filed the Giga Watt complaint on behalf of the plaintiffs.  The filing also asserts that investors were clearly provided with the expectation that they would profit financially from their investment.  According to the filing, ""[S]everal Giga Watt representatives have overtly and unmistakably stated to investors that between the time of the ICO and the date on which each investor would be issued his/her/its Giga Watt tokens, the value/price of each Giga Watt token was anticipated to increase significantly.""

42400826,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL1wX,1514986216,"Bitcoin Cash Is Up, But Correction May Be On Cards","Despite decent gains today, bitcoin cash prices could take a hit in the short-term, the technical charts suggest.  As per data source OnChainFX, bitcoin cash (BCH) has appreciated 9 percent in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is strongly bid above $2,700, yet is still down 35 percent from its record high of $4,330 set on Dec. 20.  During the bitcoin rally from Sep. 15 low to November highs, BCH witnessed a sell-off to $400. Also, as bitcoin (BTC) neared the $20,000 mark in December, investors began diversifying into the ""small cap"" cryptos like bitcoin cash.  Thus, to some extent, BCH has an inverse relationship with bitcoin. And with BTC on the rise again, the BCH/BTC chart indicates that bitcoin cash is likely to underperform its rival in the short-run.  BCH/BTC chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  The rally following a bullish falling channel breakout (on Dec. 19) ran out of steam at BTC 0.25.  Over the last one week, 0.20 has acted as a strong resistance.  A bearish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages was confirmed on Dec. 28. At press time, the moving averages are descending (favoring the bears).  Hence, bitcoin could gain an upper hand in the short-run – i.e. BCH/BTC could drop to 0.15 and possible to 0.10 in the short-term. The chart adds credence to the bullish case put forward by the BTC/USD chart (below) and points to a possible depreciation in the bitcoin cash-U.S. dollar (BCH/USD) exchange rate.  BCH/USD chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) suggests prices could revisit the $2,000 mark as:  The falling tops/lower highs pattern, indicates the bulls are losing control.  BCH re-entered a falling channel on Dec. 30 and prices may move back above the falling channel hurdle this week.  The bearish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages was confirmed on Dec. 27. The 10-day MA seems to have shed the bearish bias, but the 5-day MA is still sloping downwards in favor of the bears.  View  Bitcoin cash could revisit $2,050 (Dec. 30 low) and may extend losses to the falling channel support of $1,850.  Only a close (as per UTC) above $2,800 would abort the bearish view.

42400800,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL1fo,1514984401,Korean Law Firm to Appeal New Bitcoin Trading Rules,"A South Korean law firm has reportedly filed a constitutional appeal over upcoming regulations restricting digital currency trading.  Seoul-based Anguk Law Offices filed the appeal on Saturday through the Constitutional Court's online appeal system, stating that the government's new regulations on digital currency trading without legal laws to support them is a breach of property rights.  The company asserted in its appeal that digital currencies like bitcoin are ""not a legal tender,"" but are rather property that can be exchanged via legal currencies or commodities with economic value, a Korea Times report indicates.  According to a statement from Anguk:  ""The government's regulation is devaluing virtual currencies by making trading very difficult. Thus, this is an infringement on people's property rights by the government's unlawful measures.""  The law firm is also drafting a series of follow-up appeals filed by digital currency exchanges and investors, the report states.  The South Korean government announced on Dec. 28 that it would move to prohibit domestic cryptocurrency exchanges from allowing users to make transactions through anonymous accounts, local news sources reported at the time. Exchange users will instead be required to connect a bank account with identifying information in order to deposit or withdraw funds.  Other aspects of the new rules include strengthening anti-money laundering rules, as well as a ban on issuing new anonymous virtual accounts. The proposals may even include closing cryptocurrency exchanges within the country.  Jeong Hee-chan, a lawyer at Anguk argued that any regulations should come after the implementation of related laws, saying: ""The petition is also a request for the government to respect people's property rights and introduce regulations after a social consensus is made.""

42400825,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL1vY,1514982651,Why Bitcoin Needs Fiat (And This Won't Change in 2018),"Tim Swanson is the director of research at Post Oak Labs, a U.S.-based technology advisory firm, and the former director of research at distributed ledger technology consortium R3.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review series.      Imagine a parallel universe in which the U.S. economy could only grow at $50 every 10 minutes generating a mere $2.6 million of output per annum. That due to a hard-coded economic planning computer program, every four years the income its inhabitants collectively generated divided in half. Such that in year nine, its output shrank and was $12.50 every 10 minutes or $657,000 a year.  That is to say, irrespective of how productive and skilled the labor force became or how large the labor force grew, the productive output in the U.S remained fixed and static with the only change (downward in this case) occurring just once every four years.  How many people would volunteer to live and work in that ""Upside Down"" world?  This situation effectively mirrors the static, internal economy of bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies.  For instance, with proof-of-work networks like bitcoin, the marginal productivity of labor is zero. It does not matter how many more units of labor are added to the income generation (mining) process as the network will always produce the same amount of economic output.  Today, after nearly nine years of operation, the bitcoin network – better referred to as Bitcoinland – generates 12.5 bitcoins roughly every 10 minutes. Irrespective of external economic conditions, of demand, the Bitcoinland economy will generate about 657,000 bitcoins per year in its third epoch.  While comparisons with aggregate measurements like GDP and money supplies may be an imperfect analogy, the fact that economic expansion as measured in output can – with the exception of a fork and rule change – never change in bitcoin due to its inelastic coin supply is arguably detrimental to its unit of account.  The purposefully planned sameness is often extolled as a ""feature not a bug,"" and many cryptocurrency enthusiasts like to daydream for when regulators and financial institutions of our own world disappear, eaten up by grey goo nanites funded by bitcoins.  But before bitcoiners can reach their Upside Down nirvana state, they need to resolve the underlying omnipresent economic calculation challenge facing their security system and labor force.  The phenomenon is simple to describe: virtually no participant in Bitcoinland conducts economic calculations (such as pricing) for any goods or services in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. There are many reasons for this, including chronic volatility.  Or increasingly high ($10+) transaction fees that result in hemorrhaging of merchants (even their very own Cobra Commander acknowledges this issue).  But for this article, let's put aside the typical discussion of payments and merchants and instead focus on labor.  Labor force  If Bitcoinland is viewed as its own sovereign (virtual) nation-state, the only wages any native participant receives in return for any kind of service rendered is what miners are paid to solve and ""vote"" on a benign problem about once every 10 minutes.  From the perspective of the network: developers, maintainers, administrators, enthusiasts, Twitter sock puppets, meme artisans, flame war veterans, self-appointed thought leaders, pumpers, hat wearers, etc., are all viewed as foreign third parties and can only receive bitcoins after they are first minted by the miners.  Much like multinational corporations (MNC) with large overseas operations, miners of cryptocurrency networks as a whole do not measure the income they receive in terms of bitcoins (or other discrete cryptocurrencies), but instead they measure their income in terms of ""fiat"" from foreign financial markets, specifically converting bitcoins into the local fiat currency where their mining operation physically resides.  However, unlike MNCs that eventually repatriate some or all of their capital back to their headquarters, aside from a recycling of coins into ICOs, most cryptocurrency-focused companies are still dependent on what amounts to foreign domestic income (FDI), regular injections of foreign capital from venture firms in order to grow or even measure enterprise valuations.  Miners do this because the unit of account for fiat currency is typically stable and liquid, such that they can pay wages to their employees, pay rent, electrical costs, property taxes, etc. There are exceptions to stability, such as planned economies of Venezuela and Zimbabwe which have suffered from years of political chaos, but in general, most developed countries and even developing countries have relatively stable domestic currencies relative to Bitcoinland.  And because bitcoin is still not used as a unit of account, its labor force (miners), rely on a third-party reference data in order to conduct all economic calculations. That is to say, in order for Bob the miner to accurately calculate if he should increase or decrease consumption (and investment) of capital, or to measure whether his mining operation is profitable, Bob projects future revenue based on a unit of account that is stable, in this case, currency from foreign capital markets.  During the Cold War there was a joke in academia: that the Soviet Union would conquer the world with the exception of New Zealand (other versions used Switzerland as the cut-out). New Zealand would be left alone because the Politburo needed a functioning market so that the Soviets could know what the market prices were for goods and services.  While Bitcoinland may be attracting large sums of foreign capital, miners continually still need very liquid over-the-counter (OTC) and spot exchanges denominated in foreign currencies because it is with these foreign currencies that they pay their bills.  In this case, despite their own defects and problems, the U.S., eurozone, Japan, South Korea, China and several other countries effectively stand in for ""New Zealand,"" such that the national currencies and prices in these countries reflect dynamic economic conditions that bitcoin miners can use as reference rates in their capital consumption projections.  Final remarks  In 2018, just as the past nine years, miners will still depend on foreign financial markets for both stable pricing and liquidity. If the existing traditional financial markets became chaotic and unstable, miners would be unable to rationally plan and allocate for future investments.  For instance, the unseen costs of hash generation for a hypothetically stable $20,000 bitcoin would be about $13 billion in capital consumed by miners in their rent-seeking race.  And that is just one proof-of-work coin. If there were dramatic bouts of volatility, or even an extended bear market, this could result in bankruptcies like CoinTerra, HashFast or KnC previously went through, though that is beyond the speculation of this article.  Ironically, despite all the bluster, because cryptocurrency ecosystems lack a circular flow of income, they will still be dependent on the very financial system they vilify for daily support and stability.  And while there have been many ""stablecoin"" projects announced and launched over the past year, nearly all of them are not only dependent on commercial bank accounts, but also on the economic stability of a specific economic region they aim to serve. Guess what set of entities provides that type of relative stability?  Ideological enthusiasts will likely resort to whataboutisms and respond by bitcoinsplaining: how dirty filthy statists will censor your virtuous darknet market transactions and that maintaining proof-of-work networks is worth any cost to the environment! But again, that is for a snarky article on a different day.  Empirically with proof-of-work-based blockchains, the labor force and the liquidity providers all still depend on functional, mature foreign capital markets in order to convert their coins into real money. Perhaps this will change as more hedging products, courtesy again of foreign financial markets, are brought online.  While the traditional financial markets will continue to exist and grow without having to rely on cryptocurrencies for rationally pricing domestic economic activity, in 2018, as in years prior, Bitcoinland is still fully dependent on the stability of foreign economies providing liquidity and pricing data to the endogenous labor force of bitcoin.

Prices across global exchanges, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, were last seen trading at $14,951 levels. The cryptocurrency caught a bid wave at $13,687.54 (price at 17:00 UTC yesterday) and jumped to a six-day high of $15,393.97 earlier today.  Notably, the news that Founders Fund (co-founded by high-profile investor Peter Thiel) has poured $15 million–$20 million into bitcoin (BTC) looks to have given a lift to prices of the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  As reported by CoinDesk, Founder Fund's entry into the bitcoin space is not surprising.

Despite the retreat from the intraday high, the technical charts look constructive.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  Bitcoin followed the historical pattern: a sell-off from the record high of $19,891 (Dec. 17) ended around the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level on Dec. 22 (marked by a circle).

A high-volume ""falling wedge"" reversal (bullish breakout).  The relative strength index (RSI) has breached the descending trendline, favoring a further rise in BTC prices.  A falling wedge is characterized by lower lows and lower highs with a contracting range. An upside break (as witnessed yesterday) indicates a bullish trend reversal – i.e. the sell-off from $19,891.99 (Dec. 17 high) has ended and the bulls have regained control.  The pick up in volume yesterday indicates strong hands are at play.  View  The chart indicates that prices could revisit $18,000 in the short-run. However, the decline of the intraday high of $15,400 to $14,650 neutralizes the immediate outlook.  A move above $15,400 in the next few hours would add credence to the bullish technical factors listed above and could yield a rally to $16,490 (Dec. 27 high). A violation there would expose resistance at $18,149.99 (Dec. 12 high).  On the downside, only a close (as per UTC) below $12,701.55 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) would abort the bullish view.

Analysts Yoshiyuki Suimon and Kazuki Miyamoto said on Friday that the ""wealth effect"" arising from the massive gains in the price of bitcoin could increase the country's GDP by 0.3 percent, a Bloomberg report says.  According to the researchers' prediction, gains from bitcoin trading by Japanese investors could see consumer spending increase in the range of 23.2 billion–96 billion Japanese yen ($206.5 million–$854.4 million).  A report published Friday by Yoshiyuki Suimon's team noted:  ""Moreover, the fact that the rise in bitcoin prices was concentrated in 2017 Q4 could result in the wealth effect materializing in 2018 Q1, and if that is the case, we estimate a potential boost to real GDP growth on an annualized quarter-on-quarter basis of up to about 0.3 percentage points.""  Describing the ""wealth effect"" as the increase in consumer spending resulting from a rise in asset values, the team further stated, ""Although Japanese investors' unrealized gains are unlikely to feed straight through to their patterns of consumption, it is common knowledge that personal consumption is bolstered as a result of increases in the value of asset holdings.""  According to a CNBC report, the Nomura team also acknowledged a statement from the governor of Bank of Japan, Haruhiko Kuroda, who said in late December that speculation has led to the rise in bitcoin price.

42428385,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7W9h,1514967034,"Blockchain Voting Is Here for Enterprise, But Where Are the Users?","Central securities depositories (CSDs) are perhaps among some of the most surprising adopters of blockchain technology.  Not that long ago, these middlemen, which today hold onto corporate stocks and bonds to simplify the trading process, were a favorite target of blockchain disruptors. Now, they are among some of the most avid explorers of the technology.  But rather than build distributed ledger technology into their core services, perhaps helping pave the way for their own disintermediation, CSDs have instead identified a use case on the periphery of their services as most ripe for innovation.  Called proxy voting, the term denotes the process by which stockholders cast votes at a corporate annual general meeting (AGM), without actually attending the meeting. But the system of using qualified representatives to vote on behalf of a corporate or individual stockholder not only results in extreme delays, it creates a layer of uncertainty preventing voters from having the assurance their vote has been counted.  As a result, CSDs and other proxy voting technology developers have used a diverse set of blockchains to build products designed to remove middlemen, accelerate votes and give voters 100 percent confidence their vote was counted — and counted properly.  But as CoinDesk discovered in a wide-ranging series of interviews with those builders, actually selling such potentially revolutionary blockchain solutions isn't always as easy as building them.  Reveling in the opaque  Among a number of obstacles confronted by CSD executives interviewed by CoinDesk, one particularly illustrative obstacle is that not everyone actually wants more transparency.  Russia's National Securities Depository (NSD) has completed a previously unannounced blockchain proxy-voting solution using Hyperledger Fabric and the privacy technology called zk-snarks, originally developed for the zcash cryptocurrency.  Built in partnership with New York-based DataArt, the solution promises to instantly and reliably count complicated stockholder votes while ensuring the identities of the voters remain protected. But so far, no one seems to want it, according to the head of NSD decentralized solutions, Alexander Yakovlev.  ""There are no Russian companies interested in running this kind of general meeting at the moment,"" said Yakovlev, adding:  ""Because actually, no one in Russia wants to have the general meeting in something like a transparent and true way.""  Yakovlev didn't speculate about the reason behind this reluctance, other than to say that stock issuers want ""more control"" over their general meetings than blockchain afforded. But the difficult sell points to a bigger issue that creating a more transparent way to do business isn't always an attractive proposition.  Facing such widespread disinterest, Yakovlev has turned his attention to shopping the solution in other countries and even among those hosting initial coin offerings, or ICOs, that could perhaps use the technology to let token holders vote.  ""In my mind, our case is to provide something like annual general meetings for ICO tokens for example, or other foreign listed companies that are interested in technology and not in secreting all of the processes,"" he said.  Refining the sales pitch  Another CSD that has actually been working closely with the NSD is South Africa's Strate, which initially faced its own difficulties finding users.  After building its own proof-of-concept using Chain's open-source blockchain platform, Strate announced in November it had partnered with Nasdaq to build a production-ready version.  Similar to the NSD, Strate had difficulty finding adopters when shopping the product to the actual issuers of the stocks, according to Strate managing executive, Tanya Knowles.  Knowles said that even the word ""blockchain"" itself was a hindrance to some potential users, who were skeptical of the new technology. After a number of meetings with stock issuers, though, Knowles said it became apparent that they weren't interested in undertaking the blockchain upgrade for something they only used once a year at an annual meeting.  But those same issuers encouraged her to take the tool to the issuing agents that act on behalf of the stock purchasers and other relevant counterparties, which is when Strate's blockchain platform finally found traction.  Since tweaking their sales pitch, Knowles said Strate have obtained letters of intent from six out of the eight custodian banks in South Africa, five or six local asset managers and a number of issuers, including one ""large"" issuing agent.  ""Full member adoption"" could be seen as soon as Q2 of 2018, he said.  ""As soon as we started speaking downstream from Strate to the custodians, the asset managers, and the brokers that market has just been incredibly interested,"" Knowles said. ""Because they're the ones who are literally collecting and collating manual proxy forms.""  Beyond CSDs  As Strate's work with Nasdaq makes clear, it's not just CSDs working on blockchain proxy voting solutions.  Since making one of the largest blockchain industry acquisitions last year, financial industry tech giant Broadridge has developed proxy voting solutions for companies around the globe.  Broadridge vice-president of corporate strategy, Horacio Barakat, says several of their customers have agreed to use the blockchain voting to run in parallel with their traditional voting system during their next annual general meeting. ""The idea is at this stage to have those meetings be shadowed,"" he said.  As recently as this month the American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (AST), announced the completion of its own proxy voting solution based on Hyperledger Fabric and plans to switch over its existing clients later this year.  And the secret to finding these early adopters is identifying the most innovative individuals within a CSD, according to Nasdaq vice-president of enterprise architecture, Alex Zinder.  In addition to the work with Strate, the U.S. stock exchange that doubles as a financial technology software developer has a bird's-eye view of the industry by helping partners in Estonia and elsewhere build blockchain solutions  ""For us, it's about finding the right partners, finding the right groups within those organizations to lead innovative projects as we've done here with Strate,"" he said. ""And to be able to deliver on those processes and start to commercialize those offerings.""  A non-starter  But not every CSD is actually pursuing the blockchain proxy voting use case.  Marketplace organizer Deutsche Börse Group, which oversees Germany's Clearstream CSD based in Frankfurt, identified the blockchain proxy use case early in its research before turning its attention to other projects it determined had more value in the short term.  Specifically, Deutsche Börse turned its attention to the ""three pillars"" of its blockchain gameplan: a project with Germany's central bank to bring securities to a blockchain, a collateralized token called Collco, and a blockchain project with the Liquidity Alliance, called LA Ledger.  The deputy head of Deutsche Borse's media relations, Heiner Seidel, explained the decision to pass on blockchain proxy voting:  ""Yes, there is a certain value to applying DLT to proxy voting, in some areas, but unfortunately, the whole business case was not convincing to us.""  A lack of political will?  The technical and financial reasons why a CSD might decide not to implement a blockchain proxy voting solution are myriad, according to the former CEO of Strate, Monica Singer. But her biggest concern is of a more political nature.  This August, Singer left Strate after 20 years to take up her work with blockchain full-time, quickly being hired by blockchain startup ConsenSys.  Singer says that while the blockchain technology will ""streamline back office costs"" many issuers who pay a yearly fee for the services don't realize how much could be saved, and are happy to continue with the status quo.  To overcome this obstacle, Singer advocates for selling blockchain services directly to fund managers and asset managers ""that take governance in the companies they invest in a serious light,"" she said.  But in the end, Singer argues that widespread adoption might not result from market drivers alone. Rather, she argues the increased transparency could be the result of work undertaken by those who write the laws.  She concluded:  ""Now that we know that there is a tool that enables transparent voting with an immutable record and complete audit trail why is there no political will to implement this in all countries? That should be a bigger debate to be had as even the most developed countries in the world are having a challenge in this space.""

Users who have never signed a blockchain transaction before can quickly understand the mechanics and the technology, and learn how valuable their ownership becomes in a decentralized ecosystem.  We put a lot of attention into user experience, gameplay, and design, and the reason for that is simple: our goal is to bring blockchain — often mistaken for an exclusively financial instrument — closer to the masses. We are ultimately making it more approachable.  What happened in the course of a few days after launch was not something we could have predicted: CryptoKitties took the entire Ethereum network by storm.  Hundreds of thousands of users, most of them new to the crypto world, flooded into the app and started breeding and trading hundreds of thousands of kitties. Our contracts, across multiple days, peaked at over 20 percent of all transactions in the main ethereum network, making CryptoKitties the most used and consumer-focused blockchain app we see in the world today.  With the success, we also reached unprecedented levels of congestion and pending transactions. It was the first time we could really test ethereum's scalability (and, unfortunately, it was unable to handle such volume gracefully).  But there's a bigger point... The ability to create, trade, and tokenize things is the centerpiece of many blockchain projects, including ethereum. (That's exactly one of the main premises on ETH's value, which has seen approximately 10,000 percent growth in comparison to last year's price.) That same tokenization concept could be applied to a variety of unique assets, like virtual goods or physical ones, like art or real estate.  With kitties on the blockchain, we've been able to effectively prove that such use case is not only theoretically possible or speculatively desirable, but that there's real and tangible consumer demand for this exact value proposition.  All of that with a game.  Rising tide  Looking back, it isn't hard to understand why.  In the past, the gaming industry introduced millions of new users to the personal computer. It helped pump traffic into today's social media giants during their early days, and it's frequently been at the leading edge of smartphone popularization.  With CryptoKitties, history is repeating itself and through gaming, a new multi-million dollar market has quickly formed. It's a new market of users who are now a lot more knowledgeable about the benefits of blockchain and the value of decentralization; people who are eager to expand and experiment more, quickly defining new sets of demands and seeking new innovative solutions.  CryptoKitties is just the beginning of that chapter. Finance, exchanges, sovereignty, sure. But much beyond that.  In 2017, we all followed the big ICOs, the ups-and-downs of various cryptocurrencies, tokens and altcoins, speculation about the future and various versions of what banking, governance, currencies, asset management, identity, infrastructure and other backbone services might soon look like. But perhaps what we haven't paid as much attention to is to how strongly this growing user base is demanding new and better blockchain products right now.  Product Hunt, one of the most popular websites for launching, sharing and discovering products, conducted a global hackathon last month with a special category for blockchain and crypto. We can already find a new product or prototype in that category being launched on the site almost every day.  Metamask, one of the most popular ethereum browser wallets, has reached almost half a million users this month. This year alone, we saw the number of blockchain-related development job posts triple. Coinbase grew to over 13 million users.  Even Walmart has been launching pilot projects using blockchain.  The next hurdles  But along with advancements that have been predicted for various industries, what we will also see next year are accelerated steps forward in the direction of consumerization of blockchain with:    Unprecedented growth in blockchain users and consumer-facing applications.  Major initiatives for scalability. We already follow important work in progress with sidechains, lightening network, proof of stake, and state channels, but user demand and capital will push scalability efforts further.  Gaming, virtual assets, consumer, and business products as entry points to blockchain adoption.  Blockchain use cases flourishing in emerging markets.  Major focus on excellent user experience.        There's still room for centralized players.  Finally, as we grow toward mass adoption in the new year, it seems inevitable that stronger de-facto standards will emerge, regulation and self-regulation will start to take place and mature, and traditionally central institutions will widen larger interest in decentralized systems.  While there is certainly an opportunity for major disruption, more hybrid systems will be created, where centralized and decentralized pieces are combined to enhance key consumer values like transparency, freedom, agility, accountability, security and warranty.  After all, the same expanding bulk of consumers who are now understanding the benefits of decentralization through new applications like CryptoKitties, have started to push the markets and instigate competition to bring those same benefits to most of their everyday services. And they want those fast.  What we've seen in 2017, and especially in the last few weeks, has been nothing short of incredible. But it's only just the beginning for what blockchain will do for the world.  Still too early for mainstream blockchain use cases? CoinDesk is accepting submissions to its 2017 Year in Review.
