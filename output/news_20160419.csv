42426827,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnrh,1461107752,Bitstamp Close to Securing European License for Bitcoin Exchange,"One of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges is reportedly close to announcing a new deal with the Luxembourg government that would enable it to launch regulated and licensed services across Europe.  According to sources, Bitstamp may have secured a payment institution (PI) or electronic money institution (EMI) license from Luxembourg regulatorshttps://www.cssf.lu/en/supervision/payment-institutionselectronic-money-institutions/, a move that the company has reportedly said would allow it to become ""the first regulated and licensed bitcoin exchange for all 28 countries in the EU"".  Founded in 2013 and originally based in Slovenia, Bitstamp has long been one of Europe’s largest bitcoin startups, offering bitcoin trading and gold buying services to investors. The company is registered in the UK, the US and Luxembourg, where its Bitstamp Europe SA entity is based.  Such a move would come nearly two years after Luxembourg first opened dialogue with the industry, and weeks after blockchain-based payment app provider Circle received an e-money license in the UK.  Bitstamp is currently the fourth largest exchange by total US dollar trading volume, according to data from Bitcoin Charts, behind Bitfinex, BTC-e and Coinbase. The exchange saw just shy of 4,000 BTC traded in the last 24 hours, representing $1.6m in trades. Notably, it does not yet offer EUR trading.  A representative of the Luxembourg Trade & Investment Office declined to comment but said an announcement on the government’s work with the industry could be forthcoming.  Bitstamp executives offered no comment when reached.

42426823,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnhh,1461099963,How MIT is Using Ripple to Push Blockchain Research Beyond Theory,"MIT has moved its blockchain research from the blackboard to the real world through a partnership with distributed ledger tech startup Ripple.  While MIT has long been involved in supporting the bitcoin and blockchain industries through research, the aim of this project is to develop blockchain, financial services and other enterprise data projects, the university said.  Project director David Shrier, of MIT Connection Science, said he expects this most recent step to attract a wide range of researchers, more than doubling in size its first six months of operation.  Shrier told CoinDesk:  ""It’s one thing to develop a four node test blockchain. It's quite another thing to hook up to a large scale global network of nodes.""  As part of the research, which is currently being conducted by seven students and professors, MIT is running a validator for the Ripple Consensus Ledger, its permissioned distributed ledger system. The validator is a server that confirms transactions on the network on which the XRP digital asset sits.  Going back to early 2015, MIT has been involved in blockchain tech most directly through support of bitcoin development through its Digital Currency Initiative (DCI). Last month, the MIT DCI helped raise $900,000 to support bitcoin developers, with donors to the fund including venture capitalist Fred Wilson and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman  MIT's decision to use Ripple over alternatives was in part due to what Shrier called the startup being ""very well positioned"" in finance. He added that the university is also interested in exploring ""other different flavors"" of blockchain.  Laying the foundation  However, MIT's embrace of blockchain has roots in its longstanding support of open-source projects in general.  Since 2007, MIT's Internet Trust Consortium, which includes UBS and NTT Japan, has been developing open-source projects dedicated to helping people more efficiently manage their data. Last year, the consortium was moved under Shrier's MIT Connection Science and began publishing blockchain-specific research.  Members of the consortium published the results of their ""Enigma"" research in June, which focused on how developers could build a decentralized cloud platform using blockchain. Co-led by Pentland, the project uses an external blockchain to manage who can access data and the identities of those users. The project is currently in beta.  This January, Pentland and fellow Ripple project leader Thomas Hardjono published an early draft of their work on ChainAnchor. While the final draft of the paper is not yet available online, the early version describes ChainAnchor as a means of ""retaining user anonymity within a permissioned blockchain"".  Both a paper showing their results and a website are expected soon.  The Ripple project, in turn, is led by MIT professor Alex Pentland; managing director David Shrier; and chief technical officer Thomas Hardjono. ""Dozens"" of researchers are expected to join over the next six months, according to Shrier.  Future Research  In total, Shrier says MIT now has about three dozen projects related to blockchain being run by between 50 researchers and 70 researchers.  ""And I only expect that number to grow,"" he said.  As part of his work in blockchain, Shrier will teach a class on Future Commerce in an online setting for the first time this June. Previously the class was held in a traditional teaching environment, with 50 students creating 19 projects, five of which Shrier says are on their way to launching as startups.  So far, 500 students have signed up for the $2,300 12-week class, though Shrier expects the number to hit 1,000 students by the time class begins.

42426802,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwjJh,1461091692,Once-Hyped UK Digital Currency Hullcoin Hijacked By Chinese Scammers,"In 2014, a local government initiative in the United Kingdom unveiled Hullcoin, an effort to use cryptocurrencies to fight the problem of regional poverty.  The project, fueled by donations and the power of a small-scale mining rig, drew headlines at the time for its intersection of local governance and new technology.  Yet new reports indicate that the philanthropic effort spawned an investment scam halfway across the world, as news has emerged that a group of investors have been scammed by a group of individuals selling investment packages based on Hullcoin.  According to China News Service and China National Radio (CNR), as many as 500 people in the region lost $1.1m, or 7.1 million yuan, after trying to invest in what was pitched as Hullcoin. One investor told local media that he paid in roughly $40,000 to invest.  Complaints appear to have begun coming in after a website for depositing funds for Hullcoin purchases went offline. Local authorities are now reportedly investigating the incident.  Those associated with the Hullcoin project in the UK say they have no involvement with the Chinese investment scheme. David Shepherdson, who as the Hull City Council’s former financial inclusion officer was involved in the cryptocurrency’s creation, said those involved first heard about it through recent posts on social media.  He told CoinDesk:  “We can categorically state that we have not had any communication or involvement with the company in question with our work here developing HullCoin, which is almost exclusively invested with charitable funds.”  Despite the apparent lack of connection, those involved in the Chinese scheme sought to use that project’s details and headline-grabbing aspects to seek investments, according to online materials.  Investment gains pitched  A web page  devoted to the Chinese Hullcoin investment scheme features a number of pages detailing the launch of the local government council’s cryptocurrency in the UK, and even has a quote attributed to Shepherdson.  The page also offers promotional details for potential investors, promising outsized returns when all of the available coins – in this case, 30 million over the fake Hullcoin’s lifecycle – have been produced.  While details remain limited, information on the Hullcoin China website point to an effort to project legitimacy to those interested in investing, including an official corporate registration in the UK.  The company behind the scheme, UK Hull Coins Investment Trading Co., LTD, is registered in Hull, according to public data published by the British government. Only one officer is listed, an individual named Shengqiang Su.  A claimed investment and finance conference focused on Hullcoin sought to further position the scheme’s legitimacy. An article posted to the Hullcoin China website claims that the conference was held in November in the city of Changsha, at which a process was begun to “meet the market demand” for more Hullcoins.  The website goes on to claim:  “At present, the hull currency in the UK and China for synchronous operation, the initial price is $0.1, the price with the market has gone up. As a virtual currency, Hull, the annual income of tens of times is not a problem. Hull currency in China since the trial operation, the achievement of a lot of young entrepreneurs. At present, Hull's investment in the initial stage, investment costs are relatively low.”  But local reports indicate that this event didn’t actually happen.  CNR reported that this conference never took place after local journalists visited the city. According to the same report a publicized office location in Hong Kong would ultimately prove to not exist as well.  An email address provided on the Hullcoin China website did not return an email by press time.

42426799,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwjHh,1461084340,French Central Bank Urges More Research On Blockchain Impact,"France’s central bank has released a new report on financial stability in an era of digitization that multiple times touches on virtual currencies and blockchain technology.  The report notes that the Banque de France is conducting its own research into the topic in cooperation with the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a body of central bank governors and government officials from the G-20 group of nations. The FSB highlighted its work in the area in February, and more recently, has been looking at the technology through the lens of financial innovation.  According to a loose translation of the Banque de France report:  “Furthermore, consideration is being given today [by] the Bank of France, and more widely within...the Financial Stability Board to follow the development of initiatives around the technology blockchain, both as regards [to the] application possibilities it seems to offer...with respect to the issues raised[,] particularly in terms of security.”  Elsewhere, the report highlights how the technology could be used to reshape how markets function.  “Such [distributed ledger] models could replace the traditional operating mode clearinghouses based on aggregation and centralized clearing flows, affecting...the collateral management devices or rules for recording assets,” the report states.  At the same time, the Banque de France report authors argue that the technology is “still very largely in the experimental phase”. The report said that future tests have to assess blockchain applications “in terms of safety, cost, [their] ability to handle quickly large volumes of transactions, or [the] economic interest to do without third trust for certain activities.”  Work on digital currencies  Beyond its look at blockchain applications, the French central bank indicated that it has been looking at issues related to bitcoin and other digital currencies. It pointed to a previous investor-oriented release in 2013, as well as its work with the FSB on the matter.  While light on policy details, the report suggests that central bankers should look at “conversion activity” by bitcoin exchanges between digital and fiat currencies.  The report also highlights some data regarding digital currency transaction volume in the European Union, positioning it against the flow of euros on a daily basis.  “But [virtual currency] use is still very low: the amounts exchanged are lower [than] €100m per day for volume [of] less than 200,000 transactions, compared to 70 billion euro of payments corresponding to 250 million operations performed every day in the European Union,” the report states.

42426808,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwjNh,1461077985,Deutsche Bank Seeks Real-World Impact With Blockchain Strategy,"While major financial institutions are investing more time and resources in investigating the potential benefits offered by blockchain technology, the key question for many is not whether to look into the technology, but how.  Recently, this question has been gaining new definition as institutions seek to grapple with the more complex implications of using blockchains and distributed ledgers for real-world use cases. For example, it remains to be seen whether the use of distributed ledgers will require the use of a digital asset, which at least for now bears regulatory uncertainties.  On the bitcoin blockchain, the longest-running iteration of the technology, the network’s distributed ledger tracks a native asset representing a digital currency. And while some global regulators have confirmed the use of these bits of data represent real value, others have yet to make any announcements. Such uncertainty is magnified by the rising interest in blockchain trials at major institutions, where private networks are being created with tokens representing everything from shares in companies to shareholder votes.  However, some institutions are choosing not to use blockchains with unique assets, instead leveraging cryptographic distributed ledgers as a way to ease the ability for participants to share information on existing transaction processes.  To Ed Budd, chief digital officer of global transaction banking at Deutsche Bank, this question is less an either/or proposition but evidence that financial institutions are becoming more discerning when applying the technology to real-world business problems.  Budd told CoinDesk:  ""The degree of the efficiency you can get – it's asset class specific. Some asset classes are mostly electronic today. But, there are many asset classes today that aren’t. The weight of the benefit is different by asset class.""  Budd said he doesn’t believe there is one version of the technology that will prove to be a silver-bullet solution, saying that there will be a ""spectrum"" of approaches depending on the business challenge.  ""People are looking at this issue, and looking to take that challenge on. In some areas you might digitize an asset that isn’t digital. There are lots of smaller markets that might prove more practical, real-world testing grounds,"" he explained.  At Deutsche Bank, Budd specializes in analyzing the potential of blockchain from the standpoint of its transaction banking division, which services corporations and financial institutions.  However, he said the bank is analyzing the issue across multiple departments.  Discovery and testing  Deutsche Bank, according to Budd, is now in the middle of a research and discovery phase centered on the technology, one that’s primarily focused on what he called the ""business model questions"" it poses.  To start, Budd said Deutsche Bank elected to focus on digitizing corporate bonds for use in blockchain-based environments due to their value across the transaction and investment banking verticals.  ""We chose the corporate bond because it had more complexity than cash, but it wasn’t a highly complex niche instrument. Yet, the test led to questions around the key life cycle events that needed to be approached along with it,"" he explained.  Budd said Deutsche Bank trialed blockchain-based corporate bonds on two different blockchain networks, with two different partners, in its London lab last year.  He went on to explain the goal was not simply to just recreate existing assets as digital assets, but to look at compliance, architecture and business process questions that would result from the wider use of such instruments.  ""What we were testing was not the multi-party configuration, but 'What does it look like from a business model perspective?' 'How do we feel about it from an instrument and legality perspective?’' and 'How does it really operate and what type of support would its use require?'"" Budd said.  'Portfolio approach'  Still, such siloed tests can only inform the bank in so much detail about what many in the industry have termed a network technology.  As a member of banking consortium startup R3CEV, Budd said that Deutsche Bank has another way to explore the technology with multiple partner institutions and competitors.  Combined, the proprietary and collaborative efforts make up what Budd termed as a ""portfolio approach"" to learning about the tech.  Budd described Deutsche Bank’s labs in Berlin, London and its latest in Silicon Valley as the ""backbone"" of its strategy given that these outlets have the mandate to look at opportunities posed by new innovations. Deutsche Bank opened its Silicon Valley incubator on 6th April, with an event that allowed startups to present elevator pitches.  The bank did not provide the number, but indicated several blockchain startups may have been part of the event.  Yet, in other instances, Budd said that Deutsche Bank has explored ideas in theory, without putting such investigations into practice.  From his own vantage point on transaction banking, Budd said that Deutsche Bank explored how digital assets could be settled in cash, though he said this was outweighed by the bank's desire to look at how it could model securities.  Winners and losers  Also up for discussion was whether Budd believes, like many industry innovators, that the spread of the technology will create winners and losers, or those who succeed in adapting their business model to the tech, and those that fail due to their inability to do so.  The topic was a hot-button issue at a recent event held by the DTCC, but Budd said he thinks it’s too early to tell if the technology will lead to such an outcome.  Budd cited Deutsche Bank’s work on blockchain-based smart bonds as providing evidence that the expertise of financial incumbents will be required in new blockchain-based systems. For example, he said the outcome could differ based on where in the lifecycle of this business process changes brought by the technology are most impactful.  ""If you start by digitizing the assets from the beginning, then the roles are more efficient. Many are still required, there can be fiduciary roles, but the business models will be transformed,"" he said. ""You’re able to fundamentally change what is needed downstream.""  Some applications, he said, could see changes further down the processing chain, resulting in less disruption to existing stakeholders in the value chain.  Next steps  As for what’s next from Deutsche Bank, Budd said that the bank would be focusing on its efforts as part of the R3 consortium and moving forward on what he called a next ""stage in discovery"" in its internal evaluation of the technology.  Notably, Budd said that Deutsche Bank’s conclusion is that, ultimately, it will have to seek to launch a real-world blockchain application to get ""definitive answers"" for how its strategy toward distributed ledgers will be shaped.  Still, he did not provide details on how the company may take action toward this goal.  ""Deutsche Bank is running a portfolio of blockchain activities across the bank. We are in the process of entering the next phase and are partnering with customers and competitors to get that done,"" he said.  Budd said that Deutsche Bank will continue to watch the movements of global regulators on the technology, noting that he’s been encouraged by the frequency and positivity of the dialogue from nations such as the UK and Australia.  The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), for example, recently granted digital currency startup Circle an e-money license, while the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has been similarly positive in frequent public remarks.  He said Deutsche Bank would be keen to monitor the technology from a regional perspective, keeping an eye on jurisdictions where business and regulatory interests align.  Budd concluded:  ""I think it’s a space where, in order to get to something practically testable, you need all those pieces to come together.""  Ed Budd is speaking at Consensus 2016 in New York. Join him at the Marriott Marquis from 2nd to 4th May. A list of the event speakers can be found here.
