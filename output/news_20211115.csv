A Chainalysis 2021 report revealed that in 2019 the volume of illicit crypto activity represented a small 2.1% of all transactions, and in 2020 that volume fell 0.34%, but their expectation for 2021 was for &apos;cybercriminal use of DeFi for money laundering to increase&apos;. just as the cryptocurrency industry is always evolving, so too are the bad actors who commit cryptocurrency-related crime.

42396526,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT42XM,1637019003,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Falls Slightly in Soft Trading; Launch of VanEck Futures ETF Coming Soon,"Good morning, Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin declines slightly in soft trading.  Technician’s take: Upside momentum is slowing, although pullbacks remain limited.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $63,939, -1.1%  Ether (ETH): $4,576, -0.3%  Market moves  Bitcoin was slipping in digital-asset markets, down 0.7% over the past 24 hours, and seemed to be establishing a new range in the low $60,000s.  The blockchain network’s much-anticipated Taproot upgrade did little to provide an immediate market jolt, despite the hopes of some bullish analysts.  The next catalyst could come from the launch Tuesday of the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF – the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund to go live since the well-received debuts of ProShares and Valkyrie bitcoin futures ETFs a few weeks ago.  “This week we see another bitcoin futures ETF begin to trade, and the inflows will be telling,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the crypto firm Eqonex, wrote Monday in a newsletter. “Strong demand will allow the market to settle, absorb the weaker hands and move back towards Bitcoin’s ATH and a $70,000 print.”  In traditional markets, oil prices were under pressure, around $81 a barrel for the U.S. benchmark, amid speculation President Joe Biden might increase the pace of selling from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Treasury yields rose on bets the U.S. Federal Reserve may have to accelerate its withdrawal of monetary stimulus, perceived to be a negative for bitcoin.  On the inflation front, some investors speculated Biden might use his summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping to roll back some tariffs imposed under former President Donald Trump. And traders in the U.S. will look closely at the latest report on U.S. retail sales to gauge the health of consumers – and how they’re responding to prices rising at the fastest pace in three decades.  “We seem set for higher, long-term inflation rates, but not runaway inflation, which is a very bad backdrop for society, but a very good backdrop for continued strength in all risk assets, like digital assets,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of Arca Funds, wrote Monday.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Pullback Could Stabilize Around $60K Support  Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating after buyers failed to sustain a price bounce over the weekend.  The cryptocurrency is displaying signs of upside exhaustion on the charts, which suggests further downside is likely, albeit limited toward the $57,000-$60,000 support zone.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart (see above, featured image) registered an oversold signal on Nov. 12, although buyers quickly took profits around the $66,000 resistance level. The RSI is currently neutral, which means a period of consolidation could persist this week.  For now, upside momentum is slowing on the daily chart, indicating risk of a pullback into Asian trading hours.

42396527,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT42YL,1637017139,"Market Wrap: Analysts See Bitcoin as Still in ‘Bullish Phase,’ Despite Pullbacks","Bitcoin was roughly flat over the past 24 hours, suggesting that investor enthusiasm over the Bitcoin blockchain’s Taproot upgrade is starting to fade. In October some analysts warned the upgrade might already be priced in given BTC’s near-40% rally over the past few months.  Still, it remains to be seen whether investors will continue to accumulate BTC in hopes of long-term gains. “Historically, bitcoin has risen after past upgrades [to the Bitcoin blockchain], so many see this as possibly history repeating itself,” Marcus Sotiriou, a trader at U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Over the short term, technical indicators show slowing upside momentum in BTC. This means the current pullback could extend into Asian trading hours, albeit limited toward the $57,000-$60,000 support zone.  “While the cryptocurrency market remains in its bullish phase, the tendency towards consolidation is worrisome, shaping the market’s advance in small steps,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): 63,867.78, -0.55%  Ether (ETH): 4,574.09, +0.33%  S&P 500: 4,682.80, -0%  Gold: 1,863.06, -0.12%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.623%  Bitcoin uptrend intact  Some indicators suggest bitcoin’s price could continue higher, similar to the fourth-quarter bull run in 2020.  For example, the chart below shows the Mayer Multiple, a simple oscillator that measures the divergence between BTC’s price and its 200-day moving average. The oscillator is still below extreme levels seen earlier this year, indicating further room for BTC to trend higher.  Some analysts also point to increasing transactions by bitcoin whales (large holders) as a sign of growing investor demand. “It’s the largest [movement] I’ve ever seen since 2017 excluding outliers,” Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, wrote in a blog post.  The average bitcoin transaction amount by large holders remains elevated over the past few months, according to blockchain data compiled by CryptoQuant.  Crypto funds see lower inflows  The total flows into cryptocurrency funds declined from the fourth straight week, slipping from $174 million last week, according to a CoinShares report. The amount is still well off the $1.5 billion of inflows notched a few weeks ago when new exchange-traded funds backed by bitcoin futures contracts debuted in the U.S.  Funds focused on bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, gained $98 million, up from $95 million the week before and pushing assets under management (AUM) to a record $56 billion, although bitcoin’s dominance against alternative coins (altcoins) has waned over the week.  Meanwhile, alternative digital assets appeared to show waning investor interest.  Altcoin roundup  DEX aggregator ParaSwap launches PSP token: Decentralized exchange aggregator ParaSwap has announced the launch of its PSP governance token, CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman reported. The token is currently available for some 2,000 eligible Ethereum addresses and enables users to stake in liquidity pools in exchange for platform rewards. It also enables participation in ParaSwap’s newly formed decentralized autonomous organization governance. The DEX aggregator famously resisted tokenizing for years, saying last month that it was “not planning” an airdrop.  Solana hits Bloomberg Terminal with Galaxy-backed index: Bloomberg LP and Galaxy Digital have released a Solana index, making SOL the third crypto index with a standalone price tracker developed by the pair after BTC and ETH, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported. The launch signals increased interest in SOL, which has surged over 11,700% in the past 12 months, according to Messari. Bloomberg and Galaxy have now issued five crypto indexes since starting their collaboration.  Introducing the Filecoin Virtual Machine: Data storage marketplace, protocol and cryptocurrency Filecoin has introduced the Filecoin Virtual Machine, it announced in a blog post last week.

42410952,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtjpW,1637016346,What Taproot Could Mean for Bitcoin Investors,"Over the weekend, bitcoin enthusiasts huddled around their screens as they waited for miners to mine Bitcoin block 709,632. The block was mined sometime around midnight EST and, with it, three highly anticipated technological upgrades to Bitcoin were officially implemented into the protocol. Collectively, these three upgrades are referred to as “Taproot.”  In short, Taproot is designed to improve Bitcoin’s security, privacy and efficiency.  The expected benefits of the upgrade includes:  Consolidation of all types of bitcoin transaction outputs into a singular Taproot output that will improve privacy by making different types of transactions indistinguishable  Improved Bitcoin programmability  Enhanced data efficiency by using a more efficient signature algorithm and transaction structuring method  Boosted security due to the addition of a new signature scheme, making it a dual-signature blockchain  There are a few potential drawbacks to the upgrade, but they’re minimal in the face of the benefits and only reveal themselves if Taproot is only partially adopted by network participants (only 54% of Bitcoin nodes enforce Taproot right now, a number which has ticked up in recent days).  Read the full report, The Investor’s Perspective on the Bitcoin Taproot Upgrade, here.  There are also a few misconceptions of what Taproot means for network participants, stakeholders and ultimately investors, the main one being that Taproot enables flexible smart contracting capabilities that will rival the most popular smart contract blockchain, Ethereum.  Before Taproot, Bitcoin did have native smart contract capabilities because Bitcoin transactions could be programmed to time payments when certain constraints are met or missed. One of the most popular implementations of Bitcoin smart contracts is the Lightning Network, which is being used in El Salvador to enable bitcoin-denominated commerce. However, in general, transactions involving Bitcoin contracts are data-heavy and bad for privacy.  With Taproot, on-chain smart contracts are more viable by breaking up the execution of Bitcoin scripts. In addition, Taproot improves the usability of what are known as Discreet Log Contracts (DLC) which can be used to construct more complicated Bitcoin smart contracts. However, the implication that Taproot will make Bitcoin a smart contracting blockchain is misplaced.  Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Its Tech Stack  Instead the two main takeaways for users, stakeholders and investors from the Taproot upgrade include:  Bitcoin proves it is a technology that can upgrade in the face of widespread consensus, which is difficult to achieve. With this, as the “bitcoin the asset” narrative is gaining mainstream popularity, the “Bitcoin the technology” narrative is hot on its heels; not to replace it, but to augment it.  Taproot lays the groundwork and foundation for potentially interesting use cases down the road that developers can build on – both from a protocol-wide level and a company-by-company level.  In short, while the Taproot upgrade is a monumental part of the history of Bitcoin, there is still work to be done. A relatively popular cartoon that surfaces around important times in Bitcoin’s history, such as around the halving, does a great job showing this. The cartoon shows a stick figure with a serious look on its face, hunched over a computer watching Bitcoin blocks being mined. When the miners mine block 709,632, the stick figure raises some fireworks above its head. After that, it’s back to seriously watching the blockchain.  In general, the community celebrated block 709,632 with brief fireworks, but then it was back to work.

42411640,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLvf,1637014799,Why Blockchain Benefits the Supply Chain,"Supply chains are having a moment.  Many of the world’s most successful systems and products are invisible, but it’s no surprise that supply chains are suddenly being noticed – not because of their immense success, but because they have been taken for granted for a long time and are presently congested.  Paul Brody is EY’s global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  Supply chains run on information. Much of the information is pretty bad – think of supply chains as a game of long-distance telephone where messages from the first participant end up badly garbled by the end. Without blockchain technology to ensure the message is clear throughout the ecosystem, we have learned to live with these big information gaps.  Recent supply chain history  Supply chains started to be widely digitized in the 1970s with the arrival of manufacturing requirement planning (MRP). MRP systems took a bill of materials (BOM), expanded it into constituent parts and then helped companies place automated orders.  On the foundation of MRP planning, companies added demand forecasting and constraint management. In theory, the flow of goods at the front of the supply chain, the retail store, affects the entire supply chain all the way to the securing of the most basic raw materials. In reality, data and technology gaps and competitive concerns interfere with much of that flow.  In a normal year, these gaps aren’t too visible because so much of what happens is predictable: Christmas comes every December, which reliably follows Black Monday after Thanksgiving. The supply chain gears up to address these yearly surges in activity. But recently, nothing about demand has been predictable.  The coronavirus pandemic has brutally exposed the weaknesses in many supply chains. A supplier missing a shipment, for example, typically ignites a cascade of bad events that can turn a small shortfall into a planet-wide production crisis.  The smart planning systems upon which companies rely will downgrade the supplier, leading them to order more in expectation of more missed shipments. After ordering all other supplies, the inventory costs to these firms of holding so much material are high. So these organizations often will try to find missing materials on spot markets to finish their production runs.  Read More:Sustainable Supply Chain Technology Company Circulor Closes $14M Funding Round  Suppliers may encounter multiple buyers who, fearing shortages, will suddenly increase their orders. Many suppliers will then promise to allocate pro-rata shares to customers, incentivizing them to order more than they need. Meanwhile, if there is a spot market for a constrained product and demand increases because of smaller availability, spot prices will skyrocket.  This cycle, known as the “bullwhip effect” is one of the first things that supply chain professors teach new students. Ironically, although everyone in the supply chain business knows exactly what is happening, they do it anyway because not doing so would put them at a competitive disadvantage. Just like the doomed participants in the prisoner’s dilemma – game theory describing situations in which individuals make decisions that are not in the best interest of a group – the best choice for each firm does not lead to ideal results overall.  The power of blockchain  Blockchain technology’s biggest benefit to the supply chain is its ability to connect companies without giving one company a competitive advantage. Blockchains also support the compatibility of tokens between locations, which means that not only will more information flow across a network but it is likely to be more accurate.  When you move digital tokens that represent an asset from one location to another, you must remove the tokens from the original location to put them into the new one. This sounds simple, and it’s exactly what banks do with money. But it’s not standard procedure in supply chain interactions between companies.  The pandemic has exposed the big myth of supply chain management: that the information used for most planning is accurate.  It isn’t.  The only fix for this weakness is to embrace blockchains that provide end-to-end consistency and compatibility. Blockchains can clear up the confusion inherent in supply chains, ensuring the smooth, efficient delivery of goods.

42411151,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7ksD,1637012408,Solana Throws a Three-Day Party for Itself,"The Lisbon sky crackled with fireworks and roving spotlights. Dance music pulsed out of a purple-lit marble facade. Foreigners pressed past hired muscle.  Locals gawked at this mysterious gala. What spectacle had taken over Commerce Square, they wondered, and why were its guests talking about crypto coins? They stared at a banner: “SOLANA BREAKPOINT.”  Solana’s opulent conference wrapped with a bang late Wednesday after three breakneck days of panelists and parties meant, as the event website put it, to be a “celebration” of the network’s rapid ascent. Some 2,000 attendees had come to discuss the future: of finance, digital ownership, governance, trading, social media and online communities.  Most seemed to believe that blockchains and tokens – specifically Solana’s – were primed to disrupt it all. Mainstream crypto, they said in panels and party chatter, was within reach.  It was a coming-out party for a network racing moonward. After months of SOL’s market cap soaring, Solana, a fast and cheap hub for decentralized finance (DeFi), is seeing talent and capital flow into projects – spanning non-fungible tokens (NFT), derivatives, lending, staking, trading and more. Solana’s top brass joked that the projects were spawning too quickly to count.  “We want to see 1 billion people using the network,” Solana Labs COO Raj Gokal said on opening day. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko estimated the network’s active accounts at around 1.25 million.  Mass crypto adoption has been a constant refrain in Lisbon this autumn. Since mid-October the Portuguese capital has hosted a blockchain week, an Ethereum convention, a NEAR event, a generalist web conference and a Cosmos summit – with Solana Breakpoint bookending the lot.  Solana’s attendees felt fundamentally different, a handful of exhausted event-hoppers told CoinDesk. If those earlier community-organized crypto summits attracted OG ecosystem coders and builders, then Breakpoint – hosted by the Solana Foundation – capitalized heavily on investors.  Zaki Manian, a Cosmos partisan who nonetheless said he was short-term bullish on Solana, said the speculators vastly outnumbered the builders. “This is an event for people who are trying to figure out what has driven this massive price rise,” he said.  Massive is an understatement. A $1,000 investment in SOL on Jan. 1 would have been worth over $172,000 on Nov. 6. The ecosystem has minted hordes of crypto rich in the COVID-19 era, and nowhere has this wealth accumulated faster than Solana’s elite upper class. Venture firms bet big on Solana and won.  It was impossible to ignore their influence at Breakpoint. They moderated panels, joined project cap tables and rented out mansions, palaces and clubs. FTX, Multicoin, Solana Ventures, Jump Capital, Alameda and Race Capital studded the show.  These kinds of firms are the capitalist engines backing this $15 billion ecosystem’s staggering growth. They’re not like the VC firms of the tech and business world, one team told CoinDesk; they don’t drain months on due diligence before signing checks.  And seldom do they sign actual checks. Stablecoins are crypto firms’ currency of choice, and in Solana-land they’re shelling them out fast. Projects can sometimes add a top name to their cap table in 10 Telegram messages or less, multiple sources said.  It certainly felt like money wasn’t real. Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian arrived in Lisbon planning to back a $50 million fund. By showtime, he and Solana Labs had doubled their ante to $100 million.  Read more: Reddit Co-Founder, Solana Ventures Launch $100M Initiative for Web 3 Social Media  An air of exclusivity pervaded the sold-out conference. Pricey $1,000 tickets gained entry to Breakpoint’s main stage (in a converted warehouse with edgy vibes) a developer-focused outpost (in a swanky riverside restaurant) and Lisbon’s botanical gardens. Tuk-tuks (auto-rickshaws) whisked attendees across town on demand.  The Solana way  While these excesses made Breakpoint feel at times more like a gilded retreat than a crypto convention, the on-stage content had real substance.  With 235 speakers, the myriad panels documented Solana’s history and path forward. They often explored what makes Solana different.  There’s plenty of material. For starters, Solana is not EVM-compatible, meaning projects deployed on DeFi market leader Ethereum cannot easily port over to it. This barrier may fall as one project is preparing a solution.  Read more: Neon Labs Raises $40M to Bring EVM Functionality to Solana  Solana also has heavy participation costs. Network validators must spend tens of thousands of dollars to keep their nodes relevant, an engineer at a validator firm told CoinDesk. A higher barrier to entry means fewer participants can afford to participate in Solana’s most fundamental duty.  But Solana, which touts its minuscule transaction fees and super-fast settlement times, achieves those usability wins over Ethereum in part by taking a pragmatic approach to decentralization, a reality that was not lost on the panelists.  “Sometimes we may sacrifice some level of decentralization to improve the user experience,” Andriy Velykyy of token bridging project Allbridge said on one panel. “In some cases when we add too much of the decentralization, that can impact users in a bad way. That’s something we should think about as business owners.”  Indeed, one of the main critiques levied at Solana is that it is not sufficiently decentralized.  Solana’s Yakovenko framed the decentralization debate around network longevity. “When [stuff] hits the fan, can you still recover and continue?” Yes, he said, as long as one node survives with the network’s history intact.  Crypto “decentralization” comes in many flavors. There’s accessibility, governance, competition – all in addition to node count. Breakpoint highlighted just how many of Solana’s successes came at the sacrifice of some of crypto’s cultural mores.  For example, Serum, the liquidity protocol backed by FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried, is largely responsible for the proliferation of Solana-based decentralized exchanges. NFT protocol Metaplex has a firm grasp on the ecosystem’s NFTs. Phantom, the super-popular wallet app developed by the eponymous company, is not open source.  “Solana is so freaking competitive,” Orca’s Grace Kwan said during a panel on DeFi protocols where she argued against open sourcing too early. Doing so would be akin to showing the poker table her hand. Her fellow panelists agreed.  Trade-offs  Little slips betrayed how invested the big players were in shaping the Solana ecosystem’s image.  When a reporter met with a top Serum advisor for an informal interview, he was joined by two minders: one from Alameda Research, the other from Serum’s public relations firm.  The thing is, Solana works. And it works well. And it works fast. That was more than enough for Breakpoint’s chain-agnostic trading degens.  “I’m not a maximalist for decentralization; I don’t give a s**t about it, to be honest,” said Danny, a conference participant from the British Commonwealth who refused to provide his last name – for legal reasons.  Danny said he’d been a crypto trader since 2016. He’d flown in to see what this Solana thing was all about. To him, this chain was just another opportunity to make some cash. To his surprise, Danny was finding how many of his fellow trading mercenaries were cashing in here.  “It’s been a real, real insight to see how many degens are getting jobs,” he said, noting that he had no interest in going legit.  Breakpoint’s gathering of paper-rich moonboys was the latest chapter in crypto’s long history of throwing gilded conferences in faraway lands. This one traded garish wealth-signaling for accessible sophistication. Gone are the days where one parks a rented Lamborghini in Times Square to boast of heavy bags.  Still, the three-day conference’s nonstop parties, flashing purple lights, sushi bars, bottomless buffets, swanky venues and rented rides felt somehow different.  As one Hong Kong-based trader put it at a mansion party across the bridge from Lisbon, “Do we deserve all this wealth?”  His shellshocked look toward a bevy of flashing lights left the question unanswered.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/15/solana-throws-a-three-day-party-for-itself,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c45600c1671fd303f7c31393eb4826a7d267f4e-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396519,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT42RS,1637008679,Barbados to Become First Sovereign Nation With an Embassy in the Metaverse,"In what could be seen as a historic step toward the legitimization of the metaverse, the island nation of Barbados is preparing to legally declare digital real estate sovereign land with the establishment of a metaverse embassy.  The Barbadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade signed an agreement on Sunday with Decentraland, among the largest and most popular crypto-powered digital worlds, for the establishment of a digital embassy. Per a press release provided to CoinDesk, the government is also finalizing agreements with “Somnium Space, SuperWorld and other Metaverse platforms.”  The various projects will be assisting with identifying and purchasing land, architecting the virtual embassies and consulates, developing facilities to provide services such as “e-visas” and constructing a “teleporter” that will allow users to transport their avatars between the various worlds.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Barbados’ ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, H.E. Gabriel Abed, said the country intends to expand aggressively beyond this initial effort to build structures and purchase digital land in a variety of virtual worlds.  “The idea is not to pick a winner – the metaverse is still very young and new, and we want to make sure what we build is transferable across the metaworlds,” he said.  Digital connections  In addition to spearheading the country’s metaverse diplomatic efforts, Abed is also currently working to establish Barbados’ first physical embassy in the Middle East. He said that the Barbadian government, whose Cabinet approved the metaverse embassy in August, views the move as a unique diplomatic opportunity.  “This is a way for Barbados to expand its diplomatic missions beyond the 18 it currently has with 190+ countries around the world. This allows us to open the door, using technology diplomacy, which then extends to cultural diplomacy – the trade of art, music, and culture.”  With the release of the embassy, tentatively scheduled for January, Barbados will become the first country in the world to recognize digital sovereign land. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Ministry of Science and Technology, and many other governmental bodies reviewed the plans over “several, several months,” said Abed.  The country has also retained legal counsel, as the embassy will set a number of unique precedents. So far experts have said that the embassy will be compliant with international law as well as the Vienna Convention.  Barbados is among the friendliest countries in the world for cryptocurrencies and has been among those leading the charge on the development of a central bank digital currency.  Read more: How a Tiny Island Could Give Cryptocurrency a Big Boost  Abed also hinted that the embassies will be a launchpad for what could be more ambitious economic plans in the virtual worlds.  “Embassies are the starting point to getting a visa to enter a country, or visa-free travel.

And where that e-visa could lead you?” he asked.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MANA | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/15/barbados-to-become-first-sovereign-nation-with-an-embassy-in-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a707b0e310fc7072924f3d2bc9f171a0e05fd7a-3000x1995.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42396515,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT42MX,1637008622,DEX Aggregator ParaSwap Launches PSP Token on Heels of ENS Airdrop Excitement,"After years of community badgering, a long-awaited token airdrop is now live.  Exchange aggregator ParaSwap today announced the launch of its PSP governance token. The token is currently available to claim for some 20,000 eligible Ethereum addresses, and enables users to stake in liquidity pools in exchange for platform rewards, as well as participate in its newly formed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance.  ParaSwap famously resisted tokenizing for years, and as recently as last month the project’s official social media channels claimed the team was “not planning” an airdrop:  In an interview with CoinDesk, ParaSwap founder Mounir Benchemled said the timing of the airdrop was contingent on the development of the base platform.  “We decided to prioritize the product over the token because our belief was that in order to have a token the reason had to be decentralization,” Benchemled said. “Let’s build a fantastic product, let’s reach a critical mass with users and volume, and then let’s move to tokenize and decentralize.”  One reason why ParaSwap may have played coy about an airdrop was the possibility of a Sybil attack, to which airdrops traditionally have been vulnerable.  A Sybil attack – named after a 1973 book about a girl named Sybil being treated for dissociative personality disorder – is one in which one account uses multiple fake addresses to gain disproportionate control.  Previous high-profile releases have been marred by controversy, such as Ribbon Finance’s RBN release, which was found to have been exploited via a Sybil attack by venture capital firm Divergence Ventures.  Read more: Airdrop Ethics: VC Firm Draws Ire Following $2.5M Ribbon Finance Exploit  Another buzzy airdrop in recent weeks, Ethereum Name Service, took the unique step of requiring claimants to first vote on the DAO’s initial constitutional articles.  One ENS team member chimed in on Twitter, saying that the tokens represented “responsibility,” not “free money.”  Gamed drops  Statistics show there was a reason for ParaSwap’s caution.  Per a data dashboard from the team, over 1.3 million addresses have interacted with the aggregator, with many of those addresses seemingly trying to game the distribution.  “The vast majority are farmers, and some of them are quite sophisticated. They use bots, sending tokens to thousands of wallets – sometimes tens of thousands of wallets – and they’re not real, active users,” Benchemled told CoinDesk.  As a result, the team has pared down eligible addresses to 20,000 that fulfill particular parameters – just .015% of all addresses that have interacted with the two-year-old protocol.  ParaSwap is releasing 21% of its tokens out of the gate: 7.5% will go to the airdrop and 6% will be allocated for the staking program, leaving 7.5% for the DAO to distribute as it sees fit – possibly in a liquidity mining scheme rewarding future users.  The remaining tokens are tied to a multiyear timelock schedule and reserved for the team, investors and future ecosystem development. ParaSwap raised a $2.7 million seed round in 2020 from a total of 32 investors.  Eligible users can now claim from the ParaSwap interface.",POSITIVE,ENS,BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | ENS | AIRDROP,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/15/dex-aggregator-paraswap-launches-psp-token-on-heels-of-ens-airdrop-excitement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3865057bc044ad1389bac751d3c7f7eb3801ec6-3872x2592.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Of this amount, bitcoin-focused funds continue to dominate.  The total flows into cryptocurrency funds declined from the fourth straight week, slipping from $174 million last week, according to the report. The amount is still well off the $1.5 billion of inflows notched a few weeks ago when new exchange-traded funds backed by bitcoin futures contracts debuted in the U.S.  Funds focused on bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, gained $98 million, up from $95 million the week before and pushing assets under management (AuM) to a record $56 billion, even though bitcoin’s dominance against alternative coins (altcoins) has waned over the week.  Bitcoin’s long-awaited update, Taproot, went live early Sunday but has so far not caused any dramatic market movements.  Investments into ethereum-focused funds totaled $17 million, with total AUM exceeding $21 billion for the first time.  Meanwhile, solana-focused funds gained $9.8 million, the second-strongest altcoin last week after Cardano’s ADA.

Trading volumes in the crypto investment products averaged $750 million daily in the second half of this year versus $960 million in the first half of 2021, according to the report.  ADA-focused funds dominated altcoin inflows with a total of $16 million.  “The inflows are likely being due to increasing positive investor sentiment for ‘world computer’ coins,” the report said.

Binance said the DOGE must be returned by the users or they won’t be able to withdraw or use funds on their balances. The problem, users say, is they don’t have access to those dogecoins they sent two years ago, and in some cases don’t even know where those coins ended up.  “Due to the complex nature of the issue, we expect DOGE network withdrawals to be suspended for the next 10 to 14 days” as of Nov. 15, an according to an updated blog post by Binance on Monday. However, some users told CoinDesk they can’t withdraw any of the crypto they have in their accounts.  The news is a fresh reminder of the old paradox that, while cryptocurrencies are decentralized by design, centralized services dominating this market are in full control of users’ funds. Or, in the words of the old saying, “not your keys – not your coins.”  How a Dogecoin upgrade triggered a Binance glitch  The problems have been ongoing since last week, when some Binance users found all their withdrawals frozen due to a technical glitch.  On Thursday, Binance wrote in the company blog that the exchange “discovered a minor issue with DOGE network withdrawals on Binance after carrying out a version update” on Nov. 10.  “As a result, we have temporarily suspended DOGE network withdrawals until this issue is resolved. Binance is actively working with the DOGE project team to resolve the issue,” the blog post said.  The same day, users started reaching out to CoinDesk to complain their entire accounts were frozen due to transactions they had not initiated.  In the meantime, Dogecoin developers published a thread on their Twitter account Thursday explaining that due to the latest software update, old transactions that were stuck on the network due to insufficient fees had been automatically resent.  Last week, the devs released an upgrade that imposed “a new minimum fee recommendation” for all participants on the network, the GitHub page dedicated to the update said. Therefore, the old, unsuccessful transactions could have been sent anew, even though the users themselves did not initiate them.  “We instructed Binance to use the inputs to the stuck transactions to force them to be invalidated by the replacement transactions. We were not notified as to whether or not they followed these instructions,” the thread said.  ‘Locked temporarily’  On Monday, the exchange sent emails to the affected users, reiterated the demand them to return the DOGE and later repeating it in a blog post:  “We have written directly via email to the very small number of users directly impacted by the upgrade where previously failed DOGE withdrawals transactions got resent after the recent update that was done on 11-10-2021. Please note that no asset is debited from users account for the resent withdrawal transactions. We are kindly requesting those users to return the asset,” said an email from Binance shared with CoinDesk by a user named Javid.  Back in 2019, Javid sent DOGE from his Binance account to several different addresses, one of which belonged to himself – those DOGE he returned right away, Javid said. However, Binance now wants him to retrieve the tokens from other addresses Javid doesn’t control, he said, as a condition for unblocking his withdrawals.  “We will now reinstate your withdrawal function, but a portion of your assets equivalent to the DOGE amount sent out will be still locked temporarily,” according to a screenshot of a customer support chat, shared by another user in a Telegram chat of participants affected by the incident.  Some users said they do not have as much DOGE in their accounts as they once did. Furthermore, their entire balances are worth less than the DOGE they “owe” Binance now. DOGE has appreciated around 200 times since November 2017, which makes paying back the asset even harder than it would have been.  “I have $2,500 on my account and they want $7,300 from me [to unfreeze withdrawals],” Dmitri, another affected user with a Telegram handle twenty_one_percent, told CoinDesk. He also shared screenshots of his chat with Binance customer support, where he was told he needed to find the person to whom he sent DOGE back in 2019 and return the funds.  “I used to cash out via various OTCs [over-the counter trades] often, so I had dozens of transactions like that, and I have no idea what was that address and whom it belongs to,” Dmitri said. “I tried to find those transactions in my emails but couldn’t find them. I’m not sure I used the same email back then.”  According to the Telegram group of affected users, a couple of people were able to withdraw their funds. However, on Monday afternoon UTC, most of the group, counting 26 members now, have been waiting to regain access to their crypto since Thursday.

42411626,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLEg,1637005393,What Will a Metaverse Embassy Look Like?,"This morning, my colleague Andrew Thurman put out a piece for this website about the government of Barbados, and its plans to establish a so-called “metaverse embassy.”  The metaverse is a kind of multiplayer social space in virtual reality; think Second Life or Playstation Home – a place where virtual people live virtual lives, entirely on a screen. Proponents say it’s like a copy of the real world, only better, since users don’t have to abide by the laws of physics. For skeptics, it’s cringey at best and dystopian at worst: a comprehensive new framework for digital surveillance and intrusive advertising.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Barbados’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade said it signed an agreement with Decentraland, an existing metaverse platform built around cryptocurrency, to “outline the baseline development elements for its metaverse embassy.”  The problem is that it’s not clear what any of this actually means. Though the press release concedes that “most details [about the project] have not been revealed,” here’s how it attempts to define a “metaverse embassy”:  “Barbados’ Metaverse Embassy will be at the centre of activities to advance the growth of stronger bilateral relationships with governments globally,” says the release, before adding, somewhat nonsensically, that “e-consular services will be a core feature alongside with [sic] a virtual teleporter which will be built in Barbados’ Metaverse Embassy connecting all metaworlds as a gesture of diplomatic unification between technology platforms.”  So, the government of Barbados is looking to plant its metaverse embassy in more than one virtual world. It’s only inked a deal with Decentraland, so far, but promises that agreements with other companies are in the works.  But what does a metaverse embassy look like, in practice? And what “e-consular services” could a metaverse embassy provide that a real embassy couldn’t? I’m picturing, like, a low poly government building with a pixelated flag out front.  It’s hard to imagine someone seeking asylum from a hostile government in a virtual embassy or consulate – and maybe that’s not the point of a virtual embassy or consulate. The concept of a physical space that’s in some way legally tied to another country feels like a bad fit for virtual reality, where jurisdiction isn’t so cleanly defined.  The project is being spearheaded by H.E. Gabriel Abed, Barbados’ current ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, who recently pivoted to government affairs after a long career as a crypto investor and entrepreneur. He’s also the founder of a crypto company called Bitt.  Abed said the government plans to issue something called an “e-visa,” and that Barbados’ Metaverse Embassy will somehow be compliant with international law and the Vienna Convention, which lays out the rights and protections granted to consuls and embassies.  See also: As El Salvador Enacts Bitcoin Law, Locals Remain Confused About Implementation  Are “e-visas” for travel within the metaverse or will they apply to the real Barbados? Who needs one, and who gets one?  Not everything needs to be on the blockchain – in the absence of clarity, the metaverse embassy just feels like an empty ad campaign from a government official with a stake in the crypto industry.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MANA | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/15/what-will-a-metaverse-embassy-look-like,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3c8e098d27b64cc13c87e3c1f111aec3c3b8421-2048x1361.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Valkyrie Investments last month received the blessing of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). By adding a DeFi fund, Valkyrie joins the likes of Galaxy Digital, which recently launched a DeFi tracker fund.  However, Valkyrie’s “On-Chain DeFi Fund,” which goes live on Nov. 22, holds its assets on-chain and therefore goes some way beyond Galaxy’s passively managed DeFi fund, according to Valkyrie’s Managing Director of DeFi, Wes Cowan.  “This allows us to participate in the upside while also gaining additional yield from lending, liquidity pools, farming and staking in the DeFi ecosystem,” Cowan said via email. “We get the appreciation plus the compounded yield generated from on-chain DeFi participation.”  In terms of what mix of DeFi platforms the Valkyrie fund will invest in, the list is long, Cowan said, and includes most major DeFi protocols. “We see a lot of opportunities on blockchains including Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Matic and Fantom,” he wrote.

Brendler said Stronghold’s strategy to own and operate its own power-generation plant reduces return on invested capital. At the same time that strategy lowers risks to the company during a bear market and increases long-term potential.  The analyst said that supply-chain disruptions have slowed the delivery of miners for Stronghold, but he expects the delays to be “measured in weeks not months” for the company.

The &apos;netflow&apos; is an indicator that reveals the net movement of coins moving out of or into exchange wallets. Its value is calculated by taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows. When the metric has positive values, it means there is a net amount of coins moving into exchange wallets. Such a trend may mean investors are bearish on the crypto as they are sending coins from their personal wallets for selling on exchanges. On the other hand, values in the red are seen when investors are withdrawing a net amount of coins. Negative values of the indicator would therefore suggest holders are currently bullish on Ethereum.

42396524,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT42WN,1637002106,‘I Think We’re Doing This’: Inside One DAO’s $20M Plot to Purchase the US Constitution,"What happens when you get some of crypto’s brightest minds together? Well, they form a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to buy the Constitution of the United States, of course.  What started as a pie-in-the-sky dream last Thursday to form a DAO to bid on a copy of the Constitution has since become a full-on movement that’s attracted nearly $4 million in donations. “ConstitutionDAO” insiders now believe they have a real chance at actually winning the forthcoming auction at Sotheby’s.  The torrid progress the fledgling group has made in just five days is a testament to the organizational power of DAOs: Less than a week after someone hatched this plot, the project has attracted 11,000 social media followers, donations from 2,000 Ethereum addresses and a brain trust of a few dozen builders, investors and community members who now have the infrastructure in place to make a competitive bid for one of the world’s foremost cultural artifacts.  The individuals leading the charge hail from a variety of backgrounds, but tend to skew young, wildly ambitious and entrepreneurial – the type of folks you either were delighted to have on your group project or the ones you were giving swirlies to, depending on high school proclivities.  Across an increasingly chaotic Discord channel, these Web 3 upstarts are marshaling the expertise necessary to architect a legal entity capable of placing a bid, preparing to purchase insurance for the document in case of an auction win and identifying museum partners with the facilities to temporarily and securely house the prize – one of just 13 original copies in the world.  Grand aims  DAO forefathers helped pave the way for this caper, but none have been this ambitious.  PleasrDAO, a group that formed for the purpose of purchasing work from prolific NFT rising star pplpleasr, purchased a rare one-of-one Wu-Tang Clan album and a $5 million charity NFT from noted CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden, the fourth most expensive NFT at the time of the sale.  Read more: Martin Shkreli’s Wu-Tang Clan Album Now Belongs to a DAO  More recent groups have also eyed objects of historical significance. An association of largely anonymous crypto investors attempted to purchase a fully intact triceratops fossil, nicknamed “Big John,” but was ultimately outbid last month.  ConstitutionDAO, however, is setting a new precedent in terms of the scale of the bid, the level of decentralization of the organization and the breakneck turnaround time required – the document goes up for sale on Thursday.  In an interview with CoinDesk, DAO member and founder of talent incubator On Deck Julian Weisser said that the time crunch has paradoxically increased the group’s odds for success.  “If we had 90 days, there just wouldn’t be this energy and momentum because there wouldn’t need to be. And you need those things to make people move – it’s intense, but it’s necessary,” Weisser said.  ‘One year of startup growth’  Even if its ambitions fall short, ConsitutionDAO will likely be remembered as the crypto networking event of the year.  “We’re ‘formalizing’ our press/PR process, so I’m going to funnel you through two other people,” wrote 28th Street Ventures’ Graham Novak when CoinDesk initially reached out – the group is currently fielding inquiries from “dozens” of news outlets and formed a public relations team on Sunday afternoon. The New York Times has even signaled interest.  Other contributors boast day jobs with crypto social network Showtime; investment firms Compound, Andreessen Horowitz, 1confirmation and Cyphr; and Creator Cabins, a cabin rental company for creators, among many others.  The list of names seems like the handful of business cards you find in your back pocket after a conference, and many of them initially joined the project on a lark.  “Thursday morning I saw a tweet, and it was really funny,” Mad Realities founder Alice Ma told CoinDesk. That evening, she joined a 10-person group chat, the ad-hoc “founding fathers” of ConstitutionDAO.  Memementum  Key to the project’s success has been a heady blend of memetic pull and conceptual heft.  The DAO’s social media branding leans on Ben Gates, the treasure hunter played by Nicolas Cage in cult classic “National Treasure,” who steals the Declaration of Independence. Beneath the meme layer, however, is a slurry of civic ideals – a DAO owning a copy of the constitution would be a remarkable testament to the power of direct democracy, said Weisser.  “A lot of people were like, ‘This is very funny’ or ‘This is very interesting,’ but then they said, ‘Oh, wow, this is really coming together,’ and they started lending their skills to the project,” said Ma.  “We went through this process Thursday night of being 10 people in a group chat, to now having a 6,000-person Discord server – in four days. It’s condensing a year of startup growth in four days – and with our internet friends,” she added.  Roles and responsibilities  Perhaps surprisingly, the leaderless nature of a DAO is so far working among a group heavily populated with business founders.  “It’s crazy because people keep coming to the Discord, and saying, ‘Who’s in charge? Who’s in charge?’ Literally, this is coming together in four days – there is no one person in charge,” Ma joked.  Despite the differences in Web 3 and business experience, most of the members are on a level playing field when it comes to organizing a DAO.  “This is way different than hyper-growth at a company. At a company, people know each other before hitting this stage – there are institutional norms, personal relationships. We’re essentially inventing this as we go – using the best community-sourced knowledge and information that’s out there, but so much of this is new,” said Weisser.  Who you have in your Rolodex determines, in part, your role in the group. In Ma’s case, she is serving as the liaison to Sotheby’s after her friend Sabrina Hahn, a Web3 investor and director at Pace Gallery, introduced the group to the auction giant. They sat down with four representatives of the auction house on Sunday.  “I think they’re very receptive for it. It’s an amazing story for them, too,” said Ma.  Will Papper, co-founder of Syndicate DAO – a DAO that helps other DAOs with legal structures – has put two different plans on the table for formulating an entity to register with Sotheby’s and place a bid.  Ma noted that PleasrDAO “paved the way” to help ConstitutionDAO register with Sotheby’s, as the group has already undergone the auction house’s know-your-customer (KYC) process.  Ma said she’s made “a bunch of new friends” over the past half week, and a large portion of the success can be attributed to a mission-first mindset permeating the group.  “We’ve all put our egos aside and are prioritizing the benefit of the organization in a very chaotic, fast-growing environment. It takes a lot of mutual trust, acting in good faith, and I imagine that the energy of this feels similar to what the Constitutional Convention might have been like back in the day,” she said.  Aggressive bidders  With many of the legal and technical issues squared away, it now comes down to whether or not the DAO will be able to raise enough funds to put in a competitive bid. So far, the response has been promising.  According to a Dune Analytics data dashboard, at the time of writing over 2,350 ETH addresses have donated $3.7 million to the crowdfund, with the top donator pitching 53 ETH – worth nearly a quarter-million dollars.  “I think we’re really doing it,” said Ma of the group’s odds.  Other expected expenses include insurance, storage, transfer and legal fees – a sum that could eventually exceed $25 million, if not more.  Weisser said that it will be up to the community to determine the outcome of the auction – and beyond.  “I think that everybody is very excited about what we can do once we acquire the Constitution,” Weisser said. “It’s participatory democracy in what happens next – does it go on a tour? To small towns in different parts of America, around the world? We’re leaving that up to democracy – something we really care about.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/15/i-think-were-doing-this-inside-one-daos-20m-plot-to-purchase-the-us-constitution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3582e7d9d6246da2be7ebd1d15abd64da204f682-5859x3906.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396516,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT42NW,1636998509,"Taproot, Bitcoin’s Long-Anticipated Upgrade, Has Activated","At 5:15 UTC (00:15 EST) on Sunday, Nov. 14, Taproot, the long-anticipated Bitcoin upgrade, activated at block 709,632, opening the door for developers to integrate new features that will improve privacy, scalability and security on the network.  The upgrade locked in back in June, when over 90% of miners chose to “signal” their support. A programmed waiting period between lock-in and activation has since given node operators and miners time to fully upgrade to the latest version of Bitcoin Core, 21.1, which contains the merged code for Taproot. Only once they do so will they be able to enforce the new rules making it possible to use the new type of transaction.  Read more: Why Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Matters  What is Taproot?  Taproot is a melting pot of various technical innovations throughout Bitcoin’s history into one upgrade. It was first proposed by Greg Maxwell in 2018. Since then, the three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) that codified Taproot were written by Pieter Wuille, Tim Ruffing, A.J. Townes and Jonas Nick, and merged into Bitcoin Core in October 2020.  At the root of the upgrade are “Schnorr signatures.” Bitcoin has been using a cryptographic scheme ECDSA for its “digital signatures” where a user signs a transaction with their private key in order to approve sending it somewhere else.  Taproot upgrades to a different scheme called Schnorr. Every transaction using Taproot will now use this new digital signature scheme, adding capabilities designed to boost the privacy, security and scale of Bitcoin transactions.  In addition to being smaller and faster that ECDSA, Schnorr signatures have the added benefit of being “linear,” a combination that will boost Bitcoin’s transaction privacy and allow for more lightweight and complex “smart contracts” (an encoded contract with self-executing rules).  Taproot will have many positive repercussions for various projects across the ecosystem. For instance, multisignature transactions, which require more than one out of a group of signers to sign a transaction, will be cheaper and will use less data.  Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Its Tech Stack  Privacy  Taproot is part of a larger effort by developers around the world on a mission to improve the privacy of Bitcoin because its transaction history is very public. A curious user can look up any transaction ever sent on Bitcoin using a public block explorer such as Mempool.space.  This is still the case with Taproot, but details of some more-complex transactions (often called “smart contracts”) will be able to be hidden. For example, while right now Lightning Network transactions stand out on the blockchain, Taproot offers the possibility for them to look just like any other transaction, further enhancing transaction privacy.  Scalability  Another issue Taproot should address is Bitcoin’s limited transaction space, which makes expansion, or scalability, a huge problem for the digital currency. Developers can’t simply increase this limit without impinging on Bitcoin’s decentralization, so they are always looking for ways to make use of the currently available blockspace more efficiently.  Because Schnorr signatures can be used to combine multiple signatures into one, they can help reduce the amount of data stored in the blockchain. This reduction in data size could boost scalability of MuSig2, for example, a multisignature scheme developed by Blockstream researchers, which requires a number of signatures for one transaction.  What to expect from Bitcoin and Taproot  So far, only a little more than half of known Bitcoin nodes are signaling support for the upgrade. The rest are running old software, which means they will not yet be able to enforce the new rules of Taproot – at least, not until they upgrade to Bitcoin Core 21.1. But, even so, the network will still run just fine.  Any miners that have not upgraded to the new software will be unable to successfully mine on the network and they’ll miss out on earning any new block rewards. But developers have done a lot to ensure that miners have had adequate opportunity to get up to speed. Indeed, over 90% of miners have already indicated they plan to upgrade to the new software, which is why Taproot was able to “lock in” back in June, and why there was a five-month delay before activation would kick in.  Activation doesn’t mean that all the work is done, however. Users won’t be able to send or receive the new type of transaction until their particular Bitcoin wallet supports it – and most wallets don’t support it yet. Wallet developers will need to write new code for their wallets to make such transactions possible.  If history is any guide, it could take months or years for wallets to board the train. It took roughly two years for Bitcoin’s last comparably large upgrade, SegWit, to reach 50% adoption, for example.  Not to mention, while Taproot offers the possibility of more complicated use cases (such as making private Lightning Network transactions that don’t look any different from normal transactions) developers will still need to build those tools and implement them separately.  The key thing to keep in mind is that Taproot will enable new developments and new solutions. It is giving developers an expanded toolbox to work with as they continue to ideate, iterate and build. Some of these projects are already in the works. Many have yet to be imagined.

The proposed language would exempt blockchain validators, non-custodial hardware or software vendors and protocol developers from the definition of “broker” and its myriad tax implications.  As it currently stands, the bipartisan infrastructure bill defines “any person who is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person” as a broker.  “We need to be fostering innovation, not stifling it, if we are going to maintain America’s position as the global financial leader,” Lummis said in a statement. “I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan bill to ensure that our tax system reflects the realities of digital assets and distributed ledger technology.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/15/sen-lummis-mounts-last-ditch-effort-to-modify-crypto-broker-language,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad1dc9d511ba0530f0202b8eeb48bad6f0b68340-4793x3195.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396521,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT42SR,1636993626,VCs Back ‘Pawn Shop of the Metaverse’ With $3M Raise,"As visions of a popularized metaverse race toward reality, venture capital firms are backing companies that offer lending and leasing services for digitally owned assets.  The latest company looking to enter this futuristic market is Pawnfi, an alternative-asset lender that just raised $3 million in a funding round led by Digital Currency Group and joined by non-fungible token (NFT) heavy hitters Animoca Brands and Dapper Labs. (DCG is the owner of an editorially independent CoinDesk.)  Pawnfi uses a smart contract escrow system to allow its customers to take out loans using their non-fungible tokens (NFT) as collateral while also offering appraisal and liquidation services.  The company says its system is compatible with “liquidity provider tokens, tokenized rights and minor cryptocurrencies” in addition to NFTs.  Pawnfi CEO Wesley Kayne told CoinDesk that its most in-demand services are for “play-to-earn” gaming rentals, along with loans against high-value NFTs like CryptoPunks.  Web 3 gaming guilds, which offer lending of play-to-earn NFT assets in exchange for revenue sharing, have seen a rise in popularity for this very reason. The guild system adds accessibility to games like Axie Infinity, which has a hefty upfront cost that ranges from hundreds to even thousands of dollars.  The “move-to-earn” GameFi title Genopets recently integrated a guild model directly into its in-game economy through a partnership with Yield Guild Games.  ReNFT, a company that uses a similar escrow system to Pawnfi to let NFT holders monetize their digital assets by renting them out, raised a $1.5 million seed round led by Animoca Brands in October.  Kayne told CoinDesk he sees the guild model and other rentable NFT services not as competition but as co-creators of a more accessible gaming ecosystem from which all lenders will benefit.  As the space matures, Kayne envisions Pawnfi offering real estate lending in games like Decentraland and The Sandbox, a la “a metaverse Airbnb.”  “When you buy virtual land in a game like Decentraland, you’re really just borrowing it from the game company,” Kayne told CoinDesk in an interview. “The idea that players would want to rent land from each other is intuitively the next step.”",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MANA | MARKET,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/15/vcs-back-pawn-shop-of-the-metaverse-with-3m-raise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c41e14b09be1b7ca370fc2ddcd472e4845ab9b28-2048x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424297,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2mnTh,1636976271,"Bitcoin Still a Risk Asset Despite Last Week’s Inflation-Led Rally, TradFi Experts Say","The “bitcoin is an inflation hedge” drumbeat is growing louder as the cryptocurrency tapped fresh record highs near $69,000 last Wednesday, after the U.S. reported inflation at a three-decade high.  That was perhaps the first time the decade-old cryptocurrency traded as a store of value asset in response to economic data bolstering fears of price pressures moving out of control. However, traditional finance experts are still not convinced about its growing acceptance as digital gold, a safe haven.  “The crypto rally on high inflation is a hint on where it’s headed as an asset class, but the sharp, late-day drop underscores the limitations,” said Adam Button, currency analyst and managing editor at ForexLive. “For now, bitcoin is still a risk-on asset.”  Risk-on refers to a situation where investors are willing to invest in growth-sensitive assets like industrial metals, equity markets, commodity currencies. That typically happens when the economy is expected to fare well, or fiat currency liquidity is abundant.  Bitcoin is quite sensitive to expectations of changes in fiat liquidity. The cryptocurrency charted a sixfold rally to over $60,000 in 10 months to April 2021 as the U.S. Federal Reserve printed trillions of dollars to counter the coronavirus-induced recession.  And while bitcoin rose by $3,000 on inflation data, the gains were more than reversed by day’s end as the interest rate markets priced in greater probability of faster and sooner Fed rate hikes. Equity markets witnessed a similar action. Central banks often raise borrowing costs and suck out liquidity from the system to contain inflation.  “Bitcoin’s reaction to inflation was seemingly more aligned to the stock market’s reading into the implications for a perhaps stretched speculative exposure rather than the dollar’s value erosion,” said John Kicklighter, chief strategist at forex research portal DailyFX. “The cryptocurrency’s use seems to be less as a utility (like an anti-fiat) rather than a speculative vehicle to diversify into.”  The comments suggest that the cryptocurrency needs to develop resilience to stock market sell-off to cement its position as a risk-off asset and attract more safe haven demand from traditional market investors.  CoinDesk data shows the 60-day correlation between bitcoin and S&P 500 recently rose to 0.42, the highest in at least 18 months. Meanwhile, the negative correlation with the dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, stands at -0.22.  Another factor supposedly stopping bitcoin from evolving into a haven asset is its price volatility. “Equally important for bitcoin will be stability. Any asset with routine +5% intraday swings isn’t suitable for a large cohort of investors, and that will be a slow transition,” Button said, adding that it will take years to cement its relationship to the real economy.  Bitcoin’s price gyrations might cool in coming months with traders increasingly using stablecoins or fiat currencies instead of crypto coins as collateral to trade futures contracts.  Lack of anecdotal evidence  According to some observers, bitcoin’s history is too short for drawing any conclusions and could be a “risk-on” inflation hedge at best.  Indeed, bitcoin’s use case as an inflation hedge is being tested for the first time. The U.S. five-year forward inflation expectations rate, which represents how the market foresees long-term inflation, was in a downward spiral between 2013 to early 2020, data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank shows.  “We find ourselves in an environment of significantly elevated inflationary pressures, an environment that is also completely new territory for bitcoin and its reaction function, in other words, whether bitcoin is a decent inflation hedge or not remains to be seen,” Marc-Andre Fongern, senior analyst at Fongern Global FX, told CoinDesk in a LinkedIn chat.  Analysts at JPMorgan cited bitcoin’s store of value appeal and rising inflation expectations as major reasons for the cryptocurrency’s 40% rise in October. However, it is worth noting that the rally happened during upticks in the stock market.  Fongern said the cryptocurrency might face selling pressure in case the Fed responds to inflation risks with more rapid tapering or even rate hikes in the foreseeable future.  Kicklighter said bitcoin’s high volatility becomes appealing mainly when the stimulus-driven market is forced to seek out higher returns rather than sit in an asset with a negative real or inflation-adjusted rate of return.  “Though the perspective of retail traders may entertain BTC as a viable alternative to the dollar, the deeper money behind institutional interests is not going to swap out for bitcoin when liquidity is a driving force,” Kicklighter said. “That will likely see a stronger bid for peers like the Euro, Pound and Yen which has broader acceptance throughout global financial structures.”  Barometer of speculative sentiment  Currency traders still see bitcoin as a barometer of overall risk appetite, just like the Japanese yen pairs, as well as tech and meme stocks.  “I personally refer to the ebb and flow of bitcoin movement in the same way I monitor Tesla or meme stocks,” Kicklighter told CoinDesk in an email response. “While there are significant differences between those different markets, they provide contrast and therefore color on the appetites of retail and professional traders that are looking to take advantage of favorable speculative conditions.”  According to ForexLive’s Button, bitcoin can be used for a wider read on the markets and economy, but only on broad strokes or on a weekly basis. Big moves in crypto have had knock-on effects on stock markets earlier this year. For example, U.S. stocks fell on May 19 as bitcoin crashed 30% to $30,000.  “On a day-to-day basis, there’s more noise from bitcoin than signal if you’re trading FX, bonds, commodities or equities,” Button said, adding that astronomical rallies in meme tokens like dogecoin or shiba probably offer a better glimpse into the speculative public mindset.  A look at the price action in bitcoin and Australian dollar-Japanese yen (AUD/JPY), a currency market’s risk gauge, tells us that traditional market traders may be right in treating the cryptocurrency as a leading indicator of broader risk sentiment. The chart below shows bitcoin leading tops and bottoms in the currency pair.  Bitcoin bottomed out and began rising four weeks before AUD/JPY carved out a bottom in mid-August this year, repeating the pattern observed in September-October 2020.  “The AUD/JPY pair is very dependent on the risk environment of the global economy. The AUD will stay in demand if the global economic recovery continues, helping the pair appreciate. However, any signs of distress will push investors towards the JPY, leading to a depreciation of the AUD/JPY,” Forex.com said in a forecast article published in September.  All things considered, traditional market observers believe bitcoin is yet to find its place as an inflation hedge. That said, they agree that the cryptocurrency has crossed the Rubicon.  “As for becoming a mainstream asset, I don’t think there’s any doubt that it already is. It’s crossed the threshold now and will continue to gain acceptance,” Button said. “That secular theme is much more important than trading it around any economic data release or whatever theme the market is flirting with.”  Bitcoin was last seen trading near $65,825, representing a 0.5% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk data.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/15/bitcoin-still-a-risk-asset-despite-last-weeks-inflation-led-rally-tradfi-experts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd98fada5141bad2271ffc8fbf453779637d77b1-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
