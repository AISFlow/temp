Speaking to Sputnik News, Daniyar Akishev said the central bank is “taking [a] very conservative approach” towards cryptocurrencies, looking for “extremely tough restrictions.”  To that end, he told the Russian government news site, he wants to ban all crypto exchanges and prevent residents from converting the nation’s fiat currency into any form of cryptocurrency.  In addition, he said he wants to ban cryptocurrency mining within Kazakhstan’s borders, telling Sputnik:  “We minimize the risks related to the national market. However, no central bank has all the instruments to control this market in the cross-border market. Therefore, at least, we must prevent this risk via the national currency.”  The bank – and other government agencies – believe that cryptocurrencies are “an ideal instrument for money laundering and tax evasion,” he said.  Despite the chairman’s words, it does not appear that there are any regulations, laws or bills aimed at curbing the use of cryptocurrencies in Kazakhstan at present.

42428771,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdwDh,1522438209,Chile's State-Owned Bank Cutting Ties with Crypto Exchanges,"Chile’s state-owned bank has dumped three cryptocurrency exchange clients, according to a local media report.  Banco del Estado de Chile informed Orionx, CryptoMKT and Buda.com that their accounts would be closed in 10 days, the newspaper El Mercurio reported Thursday. The move came after Canada's Scotiabank and Brazil's Itaú said they would be closing the accounts of the three exchanges.  The Chilean bank, more commonly known as BancoEstado, was the last institution still providing financial services to the three exchanges, El Mercurio reported. As a result of the bank's decision to cut them loose, the exchanges – reportedly the only ones in the country to obtain traditional bank accounts – will no longer have access to wider financial services.  The bank did not give a reason for the move, but said in a statement:  “BancoEstado adopted the decision, for now, not to operate with companies that are dedicated to the issue or creation, brokerage, intermediation or serve as a platform for calls or so-called cryptocurrencies.”  Even before BancoEstado severed ties, Buda.com CEO Pablo Chavez said that without Scotiabank and Itau, his startup would “have to move to a different format,” possibly by opening a digital bank of its own. However, he described that option as being “very bad.""  Similarly, CryptoMKT director and cofounder Martín Jofré said his startup was short on banking options prior to the BancoEstado bombshell. He added:  “That in no case means that customers could not recover their money or their cryptocurrencies … if that happened, the assets are simply returned to the users.”  In contrast, Orionx reportedly downplayed the impact of losing its last bank account, telling El Mercurio that customer funds ""are fully backed and there is no risk of insolvency of them."" No details were provided in the article to support this claim.  BancoEstado's decision comes amid increased scrutiny by regulators worldwide of banks providing services to crypto exchanges.  In particular, Japan and South Korea have recently been strengthening regulations around exchange accounts, focusing on investor protection, anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules.

The move is part of a broader effort to improve the airline’s digital services and move the company toward a cashless system.  In the Nikkei article published Thursday, Fernandes described a system in which customers could buy seats, in-flight meals, seat upgrades and other services using BigCoin, in addition to existing fiat currency options.  Most notably, he told Nikkei Asian Review that he sees AirAsia launching an initial coin offering (ICO) at some point. While Fernandes did not provide a firm timeline, the article says the token could be offered within the next three to six months.  No details have been released yet on whether AirAsia is developing its own blockchain or utilizing an existing platform.

However, Singapore Airlines did note it had successfully concluded a proof-of-concept trial with KPMG and Microsoft, and a fuller implementation of the system could see the airline working with merchants to enable customers to spend their miles at various stores or restaurants.

42428748,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdrHh,1522429522,Cisco Imagines Group Chats on a Blockchain in Patent Filing,"Cisco is looking at blockchain technology as a way to make confidential group messaging easier and more secure, public filings show.  In a patent application released Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the company described how a blockchain could enable people to form groups spontaneously and share files and other information while keeping track of membership.  This would solve ""common problems"" faced by ad-hoc messaging teams, Cisco said, namely:  ""how group membership is established, communicated, updated, and secured from unauthorized tampering ... in the context of dynamic, decentralized, and self-organizing groups.""  The document, which was filed in December 2017, proposes using cryptographic keys shared among group participants to establish a peer-to-peer network – in other words, creating a decentralized group chat with only those members authorized to join it.  The first participant’s device would create the genesis block, and subsequent communications would generate their own blocks as each member of the conversation adds on.  The first block would “define the initial set of group members” in one possible version of this system, according to the filing.  In this version, the blockchain would specifically be used to record the group members. Subsequent blocks would chiefly record new members being added and old members being removed.  Other versions of the system could enable secure file sharing or instant messaging, according to the filing, which continued:  “In summary, presented herein is a method for achieving authorization in confidential group communications in terms of an ordered list of data blocks representing a tamper-resistant chronological account of group membership updates … There are many applications of these techniques. One such application is enabling end-to-end encryption of instant messaging, content sharing, and streamed media. This is useful in developing a protocol or application designed to enable confidential group communications.”  A previous patent application released by the USPTO showed Cisco has been looking at other use cases for blockchain technology.

In a filing this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it acquired 92.5 percent of Miami-based Logical Brokerage Corp and “intends to investigate launching a digital currency exchange and a futures brokerage operation within the United States,"" though it is unclear if or when such an exchange would launch.  The filing further stated that Riot Blockchain will begin announcing the results of its cryptocurrency mining operations with monthly reports. According to the document:    ""...on or prior to April 17, 2018, and within 15 calendar days following the end of each calendar month thereafter for a six-month period, it will publicly announce its gross cryptocurrency production for the previous month. Initially the Company will release information for a six-month period and may discontinue such information release at any time.""            However, the filing also noted that Riot Blockchain has revenue streams in addition to its cryptocurrency miners, and that its miners may have a variable output depending on market volatility and how many of its machines are online at any given time. Therefore, the company said, its financial status cannot be determined based solely on the miners.  This acquisition may help boost Riot Blockchain’s reputation. Logical Brokerage, a member of the National Futures Association, is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Critics had previously accused the company, formerly known as Bioptix Inc, of capitalizing on blockchain hype when the price of its stock shot up from $8 a share to roughly $40 after its rebranding.

42428758,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdrdh,1522420829,Winner-Turned-Loser ICON Tanks 40 Percent as Crypto Markets Falter,"The last week of March has offered no relief to the battered crypto markets.  The total value of all cryptocurrencies fell to $251 billion today – the lowest level since November 23, according to CoinMarketCap. Week-on-week, total market capitalization has declined by 25.6 percent to $263 billion. That's also down 68 percent from the record high of $830 billion seen in early January.  Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell to $6,617 in Asian hours today – its lowest level since Feb. 6. The cryptocurrency has depreciated 19.9 percent on a weekly basis.  Elsewhere, ether (ETH) today printed a fresh 2018 low of $368, as did bitcoin cash ($686) and Ripple's XRP token ($0.48), while LTC dropped 28 percent, but is still holding well above the Feb. 6 low of $106.94.  That said, a look at the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap reveals that losses in ICON's ICX token, lisk and nano far overshadow the drops seen with heavyweights like BTC, ETH, XRP – perhaps indicating that Twitter's decision to ban ICO ads has not gone down well with the small-cap tokens.  Meanwhile, there is only one gainer among the 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap this week.  Week's biggest losers  ICON  Weekly performance: -41.13 percent  All-time high: $12.04  Closing price on Mar. 23: $4.03  Current market price: $2.39  Rank as per market capitalization: 20  ICON's ICX token, last week's top gainer, took a beating in the week ended March 30, as the pain of profit taking was possibly accentuated by the broader market sell-off. The token had rallied 64 percent last week on the back of new exchange listing.  Although the rally was backed by strong volumes, the cryptocurrency failed to hold onto gains. The bearish 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA cross seen on the daily chart (as per Binance), indicates a short-term bearish outlook.  The relative strength index (RSI) has also rolled over into bearish territory, thus immediate support at $1.87 (March 17 low) could be put to the test.  Lisk  Weekly performance: -35.41 percent  All-time high: $39.31  Closing price on Mar. 23: $12.03  Current market price: $7.77  Rank as per market capitalization: 22  Lisk (LSK) fell to $ 6.8826 on Bittrex – the lowest level since Dec. 10 – having faced rejection at the 200-day MA in the week ended March 16.  The investor community is associating lisk's poor performance with developers' unrealistic expectations, roadmap difficulties and delays. The broader market sell-off seems to have added fuel to the fire.  It's worth noting that the cryptocurrency dropped 10.9 percent in the previous week, despite the positive tone in the crypto markets. So, it is no surprise that LSK ranks second on the list of the top losers in a bad week for cryptocurrencies.  Nano  Weekly performance: -35.53 percent  All-time high: $34.43  Closing price on Mar. 23: $8.11  Current market price: $5.39  Rank as per market capitalization: 24  Nano (NANO) takes the third spot on the list of top losers for the second week. The nano-bitcoin exchange rate (NANO/BTC) fell to 0.0007944 BTC today – its lowest since Feb. 22.  The cryptocurrency went live on n.exchange earlier this week, but that has failed to put a floor under prices. Further, investors are saying the developers need to put more effort into the marketing side of the business, or widespread adoption will be a distant dream. The negative sentiment, coupled with the wider market weakness could keep NANO under pressure in the coming weeks.  Week's biggest gainer  Tron  Weekly performance: +6.12 percent  All-time high: $0.30  Closing price on Mar. 23: $0.041137  Current market price: $0.043654  Rank as per market capitalization: 11  Tron blockchain's TRX token is standing tall as the only gainer in the top 25 this week – perhaps buoyed by the launch of its testnet (infrastructure for the Tron ecosystem) that garnered some attention in the investor community.  The TRX/USD pair listed on Binance remained bid above the 50-day moving average, but the weakness in the crypto markets ensured the cryptocurrency did not rise above $0.0576 (March 2 high). That said, resistance could be taken out next week if the crypto markets return to the positive. Additionally, the new testnet has reportedly gone live and could boost the appeal of the cryptocurrency.

According to a Form D disclosure filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Telegram founder Pavel Durov on Thursday, the funds raised were “purchase agreements for cryptocurrency.”  The company announced it had raised $850 million in late February in the initial ICO phase, which was already at the time one of the largest amounts raised via a token sale to date.  Notably, the filing states that “this $850,000,000 offering is in addition to the previous offering,” indicating that the company has now exceeded its initial target of $1.2 billion, and has accumulated a total of $1.7 billion.  The token sale, which is based on the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) framework, possibly isn’t over yet. The filing states that, ""The issuers may pursue one or more subsequent offerings."" As previously reported, Telegram may try to raise as much as $2.55 billion.  While the Form D did not disclose the number of investors, it did note that only people or entities investing a minimum of $1 million were allowed to participate.  The funds will be used to develop the Telegram Open Network (TON), an ambitious blockchain meant to decentralize multiple facets of digital communication, ranging from file sharing to browsing to transactions.

Thomas Mario Costanzo, who goes by Morpheus Titania on Twitter and operated a peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange website, was found guilty of charges of five money laundering by a federal jury in Phoenix on March 28, according to a Justice Department announcement.  The case stems from a previously reported raid in April 2017 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in which Costanzo was initially arrested for unlawful possession of ammunition that derived from a prior conviction. The DHS further seized Costanzo's cryptocurrency assets including bitcoin, ethereum and dash, and software pertaining to the tech.  While Costanzo was held in custody following the raid, searches conducted by federal agents at the time raised suspicions that he was using cryptocurrencies to launder proceeds for drug dealers.  The latest conviction came via evidence presented to the federal jury that Costanzo had laundered $164,700 during a two-year period – money taken from undercover federal agents who approached the trader saying they were heroin and cocaine traffickers, according to the announcement.  In addition, evidence was also presented to show that the felon himself used bitcoin to buy drugs, as well as offering an online bitcoin exchange service for others purchasing drugs without implementing know-your-customer authentication procedures.  The Justice Department said each of the five charges can bring a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, or a combination of the two. Costanzo is expected to face sentence on June 11.  Cryptocurrencies involved in the case may be forfeited by the U.S. government, added the Justice Department.

42428753,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdrTh,1522411211,Does the IRS Get a Cut of Your Bitcoin Cash?,"Omri Marian is a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine. He contributed to several projects on the taxation of cryptocurrencies at the American Bar Association Section on Taxation. The views expressed are his own and do not constitute tax advice.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto & Taxes 2018 series.      If you owned bitcoin on July 31, 2017 (and did not dispose of it), by the end of the next day you also owned (or at least you were entitled to claim ownership of) an equal amount of bitcoin cash.  If bitcoin owners in the U.S. instead got cash (the old-fashioned kind) that day, there is no question they would have to report those greenbacks as taxable income on their 2017 tax returns. So what about the receipt of bitcoin cash? Is that taxable?  Unsurprisingly, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) does not directly address the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies in general, or of hard forks in particular. All we currently have is the guidance issued by the IRS in 2014, which does not address these cryptocurrency creation events.  When legal doctrine is lacking, lawyers and judges sometimes look for analogies, trying to find the most analogous transaction for which clear tax treatment does exist. Unfortunately, this methodology provides little help in the case of hard forks.  There is not one good hard-fork-analogous transaction in the law, for which the tax treatment is clear. Though, there are many reasonable analogies to choose from.  Thus, taxpayers who received forked coins in 2017 face significant uncertainty this filing season. My purpose here is to explain why the tax treatment of hard forks is uncertain, and to call for the IRS to issue guidance addressing such issues.  Hard forks, hard questions  The basic framework prescribed by the Supreme Court is that taxable income includes any “undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion.”  The first of the three requirements (“accession to wealth”) is likely met in a hard fork. When an owner of bitcoin receives bitcoin cash, she receives something of value. The other two requirements (“realization” and “complete dominion”), present much tougher questions to answer in the context of hard forks.  Consider realization first. The realization requirement is part of the bedrock of our income tax system, prescribing that taxable transactions are only those in which a taxpayer receives something “materially different” from what the taxpayer already had.  Is bitcoin cash materially different from bitcoin? Or was the potential of hard forks always factored into the ownership of bitcoin? Is the receipt of bitcoin cash something new? Or is it just evidencing something bitcoin owners always had?  One argument is that owning bitcoin cash is different from the original bitcoin, because otherwise why go through the trouble of a chain split, if not to create a new coin with different properties?  On the other hand, minerals are materially different from the land they are extracted from, yet it is quite clear that if you own land, you don’t have to report income from the minerals you extract unless you actually sell them.  The problem, however, is that the reason it is clear minerals are not taxable until sold is that we have regulatory guidance that says so.  In addition, it is rather tenuous to analogize hard forks to mineral extraction. The land and the minerals have always been materially different. An owner of the land does not create the minerals, but extracts them. Bitcoin owners just received bitcoin cash on account of owning bitcoin, and got to keep both. They did not extract anything from anywhere.  Chain splits vs. stock splits  It is therefore easy to see why hard forks are sometimes analogized to proportional stock dividends or stock splits, in which each shareholder receives additional shares on account of owning the original shares.  Stock splits are generally not taxable events under current law. Again, we have clear legal doctrine that says so. It is also unclear whether the analogy to stock splits is a good one. In a stock split, the old and new stock still represent ownership interests in the same asset (the corporation). A chain split creates a new coin with different properties than the old one, separate ledger, and a new independent market.  Taking a conservative approach  In the absence of guidance, the more conservative approach would be to take the position that a hard fork is a realization event (read: taxable). But even if one decides to take such a conservative approach, two important questions remain: When exactly did realization happen? And how much income was realized?  That is, if one decides to report the receipt of bitcoin cash (or other forked coins) as income, what is the amount of income one should report? It is here that the question of “complete dominion” becomes relevant.  The realization amount is generally determined at the time realization happens, meaning when the taxpayer acquires “complete dominion” over whatever it is the taxpayer realized. Under the legal doctrine of “constructive receipt,” realization happens at the time income is “made available” to the taxpayer.  For example, you cannot avoid reporting income on a check payment you received by not depositing the check. Thus, since coin owners theoretically become entitled to claim the new coin at the time of the fork, there is a reasonable argument that realization happened at that time.  If realization happens at the time of the fork, there is a reasonable argument that the value realized is zero. This is so because at the first moment a new coin is created, there is still no market for it. Price discovery takes time.  Thus, for example, the receipt of bitcoin cash is akin to a taxable event in which one received zero dollars.  There is a reasonable counterargument, however: There were futures traded online on the price of bitcoin cash, implying that it had value at the very first minute of its creation.  But such futures were traded on platforms that are not so-called “established exchanges,” which the IRC sometimes relies on for purpose of determining market value of assets. The tax value at the time of the fork thus remains a mystery.  Moreover, when an owner holds an original coin in a wallet maintained by an intermediary (such as Coinbase), the timing of realization is unclear. In that case, the owner may not be able to claim the new coin until the intermediary decides to support it.  By the time the intermediary decided to credit the owner’s wallet with the new coin, price discovery is completed in the market, and the amount realized is whatever amount credited by the intermediary to your wallet.  There is, of course, a counterargument here, as well: One could always withdraw cryptocurrencies from a wallet maintained by an intermediary that is not going to support the forked coin, and claim the forked coin outside the intermediary. Thus, under the constructive receipt doctrine, there is still an argument that realization happened at zero value.  Need for clarity  To summarize, under current law it is not at all clear whether a hard fork constitutes a taxable event.  Even if one takes a conservative approach that it does, it is not clear what is the amount realized, namely, the amount that taxpayers must report in income.  Given that several hard forks happened in 2017, it is absolutely imperative that the IRS issue guidance soon on the tax treatment of hard forks.  Whether the IRS can actually do so, is a different question: The agency may have bigger fish to fry now, like dealing with the massive new tax legislation passed recently.

42428757,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdrbh,1522407606,Sell-Off Over? Bitcoin's Price May Be Nearing Bottom,"Bitcoin (BTC) prices dropped to a 50-day low of $6,630 earlier today, but a glimmer of good news for the bulls is that the cryptocurrency appears to be nearing a bottom.  To start with, BTC tends to reverse course every time the relative strength index (RSI) drops to or below 30.00, according to historical data (see chart below). As of writing, the relative strength index is close to that mark, at 32.00.  At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $6,950 on Bitfinex, while the average price across leading exchanges, as represented by CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index is seen at $6,930.  Daily chart  Looking at historical chart, BTC repeatedly makes bull reversals after sub-30.00 drops on the RSI, so any price dips below $6,614 (daily low) should be short-lived.  The fact that BTC has recovered $6,614 to $7,200 only adds credence to the historical pattern.  Further, the cryptocurrency has defended the ascending trendline (drawn from the Jul. 16 low and Sep. 15 low), as seen on the chart below.  Linear scale chart: BTC defends trendline support  Chart experts tend to prefer logarithmic scale for volatile assets like bitcoin. However, BTC seems to be respecting the trendline support on the linear-scale daily chart, as suggested by the rebound from $6,614 to $7,200. According to log chart, the trend line support was breached in February.  It's also worth noting that the ascending (biased bullish) weekly 50-MA is lined up at $6,576, thus BTC may have a tough time breaching the strong support zone of $6,576–$6,600 at a time when the RSI is nearing a bull reversal zone.  Death Cross: A done deal?  Currently, the 50-day MA is located at $9,376 and the 200-day MA is seen at $9,347. So, the death cross (bearish crossover between the 50-day MA and 200-day MA), will likely happen in the next 24–48 hours. As discussed, the crossover is a lagging indicator and tends to come before a rise if the RSI shows oversold conditions.  So, it's likely the sell-off is likely to run out of steam in the range of $6,600–$6,000 (Feb. low).  However it's still too early to call a bull reversal, as the momentum studies are still bear biased, with the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south. Yesterday's close (as per UTC) below $7,240 (March 18 low) established a lower high and lower low pattern (bearish setup).  View  BTC will likely find a bottom in the range of $6,600–$6,000 over the weekend.  A daily close above $9,177 would open the doors for a test of a major resistance at $11,700.  Only a break above $11,700 would bring a significant bull run.  On the downside, acceptance below $6,000 (multiple daily closes below the said level) would signal a continuation of the sell-off.

According to the fact sheet for the challenge, the bureau is specifically targeting two categories of blockchain applications: ""enterprise"" and ""transformation.""  The agency further explains that it is looking for distributed ledge technology that can either streamline business operations or that more broadly envisions changes in social interactions, such as within public services.  The IMDA said participants that are shortlisted will have six months to develop either a minimum viable product or proof-of-concept. Winning projects will receive S$50,000 (US$38,000) for the enterprise section or S$100,000 (US$76,000) for the transformation category.  Philip Heah, senior director of sectoral transformation at the IMDA, commented:  “To ensure every business is a digital business, Singapore’s Digital Economy requires technologies which can accelerate sector transformation. Through the IMDA Blockchain Challenge, we will drive awareness and spur development and adoption of this promising technology throughout our economy, including non-fintech segments.”  Separately, the IMDA is also calling for broader industry collaboration with blockchain startups focusing on identification-related solutions or any more general project that is interested in working with the agency on blockchain development.  The challenge is being launched at a time when Singapore has repeatedly been voicing support for moves to adopt the technology.  As previously reported, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state's de facto central bank, is already working on a cross-border remittance solution based on blockchain – called Project Ubin – through partnership with the Bank of Canada.

The document – which is currently open for feedback – explains the need to protect consumers, prevent money laundering and other crimes and protect Malta’s reputation, saying the criteria set out in the paper will inform a planned regulatory ""sandbox"" environment. Ultimately, this sandbox could result in new regulations for Malta’s remote gaming ecosystem.  Notably, companies that want to accept cryptocurrencies will have satisfy a range of conditions, including that the cryptocurrencies provide financial and technological value, that they can be traded on exchanges with a “competitive market capitalization” and that they are integral to the company's use case.  The regulator says it will evaluate each cryptocurrency and provide final approval over whether a company can utilize them in their businesses. Similar conditions apply to custom tokens, says the document.  As part of the sandbox, games hosted by an operator must use a distributed ledger to “maintain the transparency and prove the fairness of these games.”  The MGA states:  “For the duration of this sandbox, the MGA will accept games that are hosted fully or partially on a blockchain environment, provided that the operator shall ensure that the gaming service is not unduly disrupted by such operational setup.”  The guidelines further specify how AML procedures should work, noting that game operators must plan for ""the risks which may arise, or be exacerbated by, the use of cryptocurrencies or custom tokens as a funding method.""  Anyone interested in providing feedback should email the MGA by April 30, 2018.

42428756,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdrVh,1522396843,Taxing All Bitcoin Buying Will Backfire for the IRS,"Joe Colangelo is the founder and CEO of Boxcar, the “Airbnb of parking.”  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      Bitcoin has a remarkable way of teaching people very rapidly about the law of unintended consequences.  A great example is when the Chinese government began inspecting regulated exchanges in February 2017. Believing that the exchanges might get shut down (they eventually did), buyers flocked to Localbitcoins, a peer-to-peer exchange whose volume surged 3,600% in the course of a month. By trying to keep better track of and control bitcoin users in China, the government drove them to a method that was much harder to surveil.  In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) treatment of bitcoin taxation has arguably had a similar effect.  By effectively telling taxpayers they need to calculate capital gains taxes for every $25 gift card purchased with bitcoin, the IRS is giving them one more reason to treat bitcoin less like a payment protocol and more like digital gold.  But perhaps more importantly from a public-policy perspective, the agency’s guidance may encourage citizens to use unregulated foreign cryptocurrency exchanges and transact using privacy coins such as zcash and monero. It’s almost certainly a contributing factor behind the estimated 0.5% self-reporting rate among bitcoin users come tax time.  The vast majority of bitcoin users I know understand that paying taxes on short- and long-term capital gains is not only required by law, but also fair. The same cannot be said for the taxing of purchases of low-dollar items under the guidance that the IRS issued four years ago.  The 2014 guidance  Stepping back, when that guidance came out in March 2014, the market looked very different.  It had been less than a month since Mt Gox ceased all withdrawals, and a teenage Vitalik Buterin had just introduced a “client that looks like Android that can run apps” called ethereum.  I was at Coinsummit 2014 the week the IRS published its guidance stating that digital currency would be treated as property, even if it was being used to buy baseball caps or MP3s.  At the conference, I asked Vinny Lingham, then CEO of Gyft.com, what support his company might offer for customers who had purchased gift cards with bitcoin on his platform over the past year.  His answer was that while Gyft could make it easier to track spending, it would be unable to verify the cost basis of any bitcoin used to make purchases.  As a result, all purchasers of these gift cards would either: 1) manually track all their purchases, sales, gains, losses, and transfers 2) stop using bitcoin to purchase gift cards or 3) become white collar criminals who don’t report a portion of their taxes.  I don’t think it’s a mere coincidence that 2014 was the year the bitcoin community started to bifurcate between those who invested in it as store of value and those who used it as a currency to make purchases. This division only grew sharper in the years, and led last year to the fork in protocols of bitcoin and bitcoin cash.  To be sure, there were many factors behind the split: from the differing incentives between startups and other factions of the community to bitcoin’s deflationary nature and rapid price appreciation.  But by ignoring the consumer-usage angle and focusing solely on investing and speculating, the IRS further incentivized HODLing and discouraged everyday purchases with digital currency.  Bitcoin’s track record as a speculative investment has not disappointed, either, with the value of bitcoin up 2,000 percent since the IRS first released its guidance, while daily transactions (an admittedly unscientific measure of bitcoin’s use as a payment method) have merely doubled.  In the IRS’ own interest  As an agency narrowly focused on maximizing revenue, the IRS is probably indifferent to the way people choose to use bitcoin, so long as gains are reported and taxes paid.  But by discouraging the real-world use of cryptocurrencies as money for purchasing goods, the IRS is reducing the incentive for companies in the space to build robust tools to track spending and improve tax reporting.  There might be a straightforward way for the IRS to mitigate these consequences, though.  A year ago, Coin Center, a non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies, published a piece entitled “Bitcoin taxation is broken. Here’s how to fix it.”  In this post, Executive Director Jerry Brito argued that when bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are used to purchase goods such as coffee or socks, they are being used not as investments, but similar to the way in which foreign currencies are used by Americans to purchase goods abroad.  Brito went on:  “Say you buy 100 euros for 100 dollars because you’re spending the week in France. Before you get to France, the exchange rate of the Euro rises so that the €100 you bought are now worth $105. When you buy a baguette with your euros, you experience a gain, but the tax code has a de minimis exemption for personal foreign currency transactions, so you don’t have to report this gain on your taxes.”  By implementing a similar de minimus exemption for cryptocurrency gains under $200, the IRS could massively simplify the tax code in this area and make it more likely that bitcoin users will report their gains properly. These ideas are not entirely dissimilar from ones I proposed in a 2014 paper on the same subject.  Not only would this spare bitcoiners from having to keep records of every piddling purchase they make or live in fear of prosecution, it might also improve overall tax compliance. How’s that for counterintuitive results?

42428750,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdrDh,1522390823,Exchange OKEx to Roll Back Trades After Futures Plunge,"Hong Kong-based crypto trading platform OKEx will roll back futures transactions following what it called an ""irregular"" sell-off.  OKEx, operated by cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, said Friday that the move comes after it temporarily halted futures trading and token withdrawals following the incident, which occurred between 5 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. Hong Kong Time (HKT) or 21:00 to 22:30 UTC this morning. The sell-off pulled down the price of the quarterly bitcoin futures significantly compared to the cryptocurrency's value.  The rollback will undo transactions going back to 04:47 a.m. HKT, and is set to occur at 3:30 p.m. HKT today, according to the statement.  ""OKEx always has the customers' best interests at heart, and we are dedicated to providing the best products and technologies to protect our customers. Transactions were suspended for several hours due to the incident. Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused,"" the platform's team wrote in its notice.  The announcement came in the wake of widespread criticism from users, who complained that OKEx's system can't prevent what was seen by many as maliciously intended activities. Some investors went as far as to allege that OKEx itself was involved in the alleged manipulation. OKEx has not responded to the comments.  Screen captures  shared on Twitter show that during the period, the price of bitcoin futures on OKEx first started the fall around 22:00 UTC and dropped to nearly $5,200. A quick rebound pushed prices to around $6,000, only to slide further to as low as $4,755.  However, within the same period, the price of bitcoin itself largely held at around $7,000, according to CoinDesk data, indicating a 20 percent difference between prices.  The price of bitcoin fell to a 50-day low Friday morning as it dropped below $7,000. During Thursday's trading session, the prices of other major cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin cash and ether, fell to their lowest point since the start of the year.

42428749,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdrLh,1522382659,Broken Privacy? The Allegations Against Monero Are Old News,"Nothing spreads faster than FUD.  Case in point, a new research paper has sparked panic across the monero community in that it alleges the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency is not so private. Yet, while the findings are genuine, the media aftermath ignores that much of the research in question was originally published in 2017, and the vulnerability it highlights was resolved with monero's September 2017 hard fork upgrade.  Titled ""An Empirical Analysis of Linkability in the Monero Blockchain,"" the 2017 paper, written by Andrew Miller, Malte Moser, Kevin Lee and Arvind Narayanan, highlighted how ring signatures could cause types of linkability that could, in turn, cause users to be identified. According to the paper, up to 62% of transactions up until February 2017 were linkable.  Accompanied by a website that allowed users to check whether their transactions could be linked, the release of the original paper sent shock waves throughout the community.  The paper was heavily scrutinized by the monero team, who wrote that the study came with some significant oversights, including a failure to mention that many of the exploits had already been documented.  But the damage had been done, and so monero developers moved to make RingCT, a confidential signatures technology, mandatory (where they were optional before) through the September hard fork.  Now, in the newly released version of the paper – which at least speaks to monero's work to secure its systems – authored by a larger team, the findings related to the loss of privacy remain unchanged, even though the vulnerability has since been resolved.  “The monero project would like to remind everyone that the largest vulnerability in this paper was noted over two years before, was mitigated over a year before and was nearly completely resolved before the first version of the paper was published,”Justin Ehrenhofer, a developer that goes by the name SamsungGalaxyPlayer, wrote in a statement.  Yet, the news has spread like wild fire across social media and mainstream media outlets, this week, leading to bitter in-fighting on many privacy-focussed channels.  A post on a dedicated forum on social media site Hacker News called the team “irresponsible and reckless,” citing the failure of monero to educate its users on the privacy threats to the cryptocurrency. Articles in Wired, Naked Security, Slashdot and on security researcher Bruce Schneier's blog echoed similar sentiments, warning users that monero comes with dangerous security risks, a traceability that could extend into future transactions as well.  Sarang Noether, a pseudonymous cryptographer at Monero Research Lab, told CoinDesk:  “They don't seem to acknowledge that there was an earlier version of this at all.”  Misplaced timelines  What is particularly frustrating to monero developers about the update to the paper is that while it depicts the cryptocurrency in a more positive light, the timelines its using to prove the past linkability problem don't explain the full story.  For instance, because the most recent analysis only takes into account monero since April of last year, it doesn't take into consideration the full effectiveness of RingCT, which monero developers said almost completely reduced the instance of linked transactions. And it's upcoming hard fork is likely to eliminate those instances altogether.  Plus, in a statement, monero developers emphasized that the algorithm deployed by the paper's research team was outdated, an oversight that could have falsified certain results.  Speaking to the misleading nature of the paper, monero core developer Gingeropolous wrote:  ”[Article] Should read: Cryptonote is less untraceable than it seems, so monero has been altruistically making improvements.’”  Yet, even with less technical members of the cryptocurrency community worried, several members of the Monero Research Lab said the paper was better than the original in that it mentioned the adoption of RingCT.  “It's a much better paper now than it was, it actually mentions RingCT, our confidential transaction scheme. The graphs tell a pretty fair story, and it's obvious that monero's privacy is improving just by eyeballing the paper,” Surae Noether, monero mathematician, said.  New mitigations  And on top of that, the paper comes with some fresh insights, namely an analysis of monero's public mining pools.  In response to last year's paper, the monero team recommended that more research be done into the identification of transactions originating from public mining pools. And in this update of the paper, the authors moved to provide that research.  “This is the first time I am aware of that the proportion of pool transactions have been estimated,” Ehrenhofer said.  The paper also includes a discussion on monero’s usage in crime, particularly its use for payments on darknet market Alphabay. A source told CoinDesk this research was intended to emphasize the importance of privacy robustness for sensitive transactions.  As such, the paper concludes with a number of recommendations for improving monero going forward.  For one, a new algorithm is suggested that could reinforce the cryptocurrency’s ring signature scheme. There’s also a new “mixin” method for sampling random inputs in ring signatures. Further methods of instilling the utmost privacy include avoiding payouts from public pools and more carefully informing users that transactions prior to early 2017 are vulnerable to tracing analysis.  Indeed, the new research is useful for the cryptocurrency.  ""It's important to keep in mind that this isn't some issue on which we're throwing up our hands and saying 'oh well, this is life from now on,'"" Sarang Noether wrote on reddit. ""I personally look forward to the day when we have the math to move past ring signatures altogether to a more complete sender anonymity set.""  Echoing this, Ehrenhofer wrote in a statement:  ""The monero project is thankful to have many of the world's top researchers evaluating the effectiveness of monero's ring signatures.""

According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the world's largest cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,700, a move that follows its steady decline from around $8,000 since the start of the Mar. 29 trading session, a 15 percent dip within a day.  Stepping back, that price puts bitcoin at a 51-day low, down 42 percent from its recent high at $11,660 on Mar. 5, and 60 percent from its 2018 high of $17,144 observed on Jan. 7.  However, the 2018 low of bitcoin still remains at $5,947 on Feb. 6, according to CoinDesk's data.  Still, bitcoin's drop also follows a broader market decline.  Data from CoinMarketCap shows the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is now at a three-month low of $256 billion, a 70 percent decline since its 2018 high above $800 billion in early January.  Indeed, the top 20 tokens are all showing a 10 to 20 percent sell-off within the last 24 hours.  As reported before, the second to fourth largest cryptocurrencies by volume - ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash - have all hit 2018 low.
