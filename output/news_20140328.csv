42425571,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZEvh,1396041246,"Bitcoin Enthusiast Loses Price Bet, Eats Hat","An American bitcoin enthusiast has filmed himself eating his hat after losing a bet.  Acting in what, with hindsight, was extreme optimism, the man wagered that the bitcoin price would not fall below $1,000. Yes, we are fully aware that it was not a good bet to make, and so, now, is the unnamed fan of the digital currency.  The video – posted by someone titled, of course, 'Hat Eater' – showed up on reddit on Thursday, and soon spread through social networks and cryptocurrency communities.  Bitcoin bon appétit  What can we say? The 45-minute video depicts Hat Eater eating a hat. A red, cotton one. The unwelcome snack took him three days, a few sandwich, some ice tea and a couple of beers to force down. Some ketchup was also involved.  So far the video has notched up 120,000 views on YouTube and as you may expect, the comments are just as ridiculous as the video itself. Some called it integrity, others believed it was pointless and plain silly.  In any case, there's one less hat in the world and bitcoin has slipped to around a half of the $1,000 minimum the naive gambler set. Let's just hope it was a one-off bet and there's nobody out there who made a similar wager at $500.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/28/bitcoin-enthusiast-loses-price-bet-eats-hat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4704f9151727410de37dd6c74024ee8dcb84d246-1092x710.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425582,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZFJh,1396040319,Price of Bitcoin Falls Under $500 Amid Uncertainty in China,"The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (USD BPI) remained below $500 on Friday 28th March, amid continued uncertainty over whether the Chinese government would seek to prohibit banks from working with digital currency exchanges.  Sources in China indicated that the reports, which first surfaced on 27th March, appear to be true, though the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has yet to give any formal indication that its position on bitcoin and other digital currencies has shifted.  At press time, the price of bitcoin had recovered slightly from an open of $478.16 on the CoinDesk USD BPI to $488.17, a rise of just over 2% or $10.  The most recent decline began at roughly 13:00 GMT on 26th March, when the price, then holding at $588, dropped rapidly to a weekly low of $477 at 23:00 GMT on 27th March.  The drop was caused by a report from China-based news source Caixin about China's possible policy change. The media outlet has not retracted its story.  One potentially troubling sign was that the PBOC has not yet come out to debunk the news, as it did on 21st March when China-based microblogging site Sina Weibo published false rumors that bitcoin would soon be banned in China.  The PBOC has yet to make a similar announcement regarding this latest news.  Exchanges keep options open  Speaking to CoinDesk at CoinSummit, BTC China CEO Bobby Lee indicated that China's current policy motive is to ensure its nationalized banking system stays healthy by keeping the volatile digital currency bitcoin separate from mainstream businesses.  Further, Lee said he has been trying to convince the Chinese government to regulate exchanges, issue licenses and establish best practices for the industry.  Speaking separately on how he would respond should the current rumors prove true, he said:  ""We will adjust our business model accordingly, and it's too early to tell what all of the options are, and which directions we will proceed down.""  CNY bitcoin prices sees similar decline  The CoinDesk Chinese Yuan Bitcoin Price Index (CNY BPI), introduced on 26th March, has observed similar declines, falling from ¥3,603 at 13:00 GMT on 26th March to a low of ¥2,849 at 23:00 GMT on 27th March.  At press time, the CNY BPI had increased nearly 5%, or ¥140.87 from the day's opening price of ¥2856 to reach ¥2,996.  The CNY BPI tracks price movements on BTC China and OKCoin.  Latest USD BPI Prices  At press time, the price of bitcoin across the three USD BPI exchanges - Bitstamp, Bitfinex and BTC-e - remained below $500.  Bitfinex displayed the lowest selling price of $488.50, slightly below the $489.50 observed on UK-based exchange Bitstamp.  BTC-e prices were the least affected by the decline, having fallen to $492.90.  CoinDesk continues to monitor the developing China story.

42425573,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZExh,1396035090,Isle of Man Welcomes Digital Currency Exchanges 'No License Required',"R Paul Davis is Group General Counsel for the Counting House Services group of companies, headquartered in Canada, and lives and works in the Isle of Man. A Canadian barrister and solicitor, his practice is specialized in international payments law and technology.    _____________________________    The Isle of Man seems to be setting itself up as a hub for bitcoin-related businesses. The self-governing British Crown dependency is already appealing to conventional businesses and wealthy individuals, and the latest indications are that this fiscally liberal environment will be extended to cryptocurrency-related activities as well.  On Wednesday 26th March, the island's Financial Supervision Commission, responding to a legal opinion written for Canadian clients by the author, confirmed that a bitcoin exchange that holds client funds with a licensed overseas payment service provider is not required to obtain a licence in the country for its activities.  The FSC confirmed that neither Class 2 of the Regulated Activities Order, “Investment Business,” nor Class 8 “Money Transmission Services” cover bitcoin exchange activities.  This situation may not last forever, however.  The FSC ruling continues:    “[...] it is possible that legislation could be amended in the future to bring the proposed activities within regulated activity and/or to make the activity subject to the AML Code and thus subject to the draft Designated Businesses (Registration and Oversight) Bill 2014.      It is therefore important that if the client pursues its interest in operating from the Isle of Man that it keeps abreast of relevant legislative changes and remains prepared for these possible eventualities.”    While the thought of operating a digital exchange within the regulatory framework of the FSC might be considered an unwelcome addition to activities, in fact several exchange operators considering the Isle of Man as a base would welcome their business being subjected to regulation.  This would open the doors of at least two specialized island banks who are ready to offer facilities to regulated entities, but not to unlicensed businesses.  Only very minor changes to a statutory instrument, not even primary legislation, could achieve regulation. It is likely, however, that the FSC would want considerable time to enhance its understanding of the field and put appropriate mechanisms and staff training place before taking on a new vertical.  Desirable base  The Isle of Man is highly attractive to e-business not least because of its low tax regime, where resident individuals are taxed at 20% to a maximum of £120,000 per year, while businesses pay no corporate tax and banks only 10%.  The island also boasts massive bandwith and redundancy, with world-class DDoS protection and multiple options for secure hosting.  Long renowned as a safe and compliant financial centre, the cachet of an Isle of Man base is highly desirable and in the wake of the FSC decision, two well-known bitcoin exchanges have already incorporated on the island, have established facilities and are recruiting staff.  Eric Benz of the UK Digital Currency Association has said that up to 15 further exchanges may now seriously consider basing operations on the island.  Cryptocoin hub?  On 1st April, approximately 30 individuals from the Island with interests in the bitcoin arena, ranging from hosting services and bankers to miners and exchange operators, will meet to form the Manx Digital Currency Association.  Digital currency has attracted strong government interest and the Department of Economic Development, which offers among other things generous grants and support to businesses moving to the Crown dependency, has given serious attention to bitcoin and its relatives in recent weeks.  Many see the Isle of Man as a logical centre of digital currency activity and the excess of power and concentration of financial talent on the island make it a serious contender.

42425584,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZFNh,1396027817,"Money-Spinners: Genesis1 Bitcoin and Dogecoin ATM's Arrive in Tijuana, Mexico","Step up, roll up your sleeve, and start smoothing out those crumpled banknotes as CoinDesk brings you the latest in bitcoin ATM and vending machine announcements from around the world.  We say 'vending machines' not as a joke, but because in some jurisdictions cash-in only machines are classified as exactly that, to remain free from additional banking regulations ... or bans.  Speaking of which, the week began on a sour note in Dubai when the UAE Department of Economic Development (DED) told us there was no license to install a bitcoin ATM in the country as yet.  To rub salt in the wounds, it was also revealed the 400 shiny blue terminals waiting in the warehouse weren't even bitcoin ATMs, but everyday, unexciting bill-paying kiosks. All that was quickly forgotten, though, when ATMs suddenly started popping up in new and exotic locations and even new currencies, like:  Tijuana, Mexico  Two Genesis1 ATMs began operating at the Bit Center in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico last Saturday. The previously little-seen Genesis1 machines are probably the most versatile out there – not only do they feature both cash-in and cash-out functions, this announcement gave us more:  ""The Genesis1 ATMs differ from other Bitcoin ATM models in that the machine supports litecoin and dogecoin as well. Bitcoin42 acquired and deployed two machines, one accommodating Mexican pesos and the other US dollars.""  You heard that right: Dogecoin ATMs!  Tijuana's Bit Center is a local business development, innovation and technology centre, that also serves as a co-working space for Mexican startups.  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  Singapore's Numoni is the quiet achiever of the bitcoin ATM world, stealthily installing its cute and colorful bitcoin vending machines in various locations around Southeast Asia for us to discover, usually without much fanfare. So we were pleased to hear reports of another one this week, in the upscale Bangsar district on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. There is reportedly another Numoni machine installed at a cellphone shop in Malaysia's island state, Penang, although we haven't seen photos of it yet.  Taipei, Taiwan  We briefly mentioned the Taiwan ATM last week, and are happy to report it is finally up and running smoothly at the colorful Cosi I cosi Gelateria ice-cream parlor in Taipei. For the record, the parlor also accepts bitcoin and challenges you to leave the store without spending some of your newly acquired bitcoin on something cold and sweet.  Sydney, Australia  Australia has been teasing us for too long. As early as February, a company called Australian Bitcoin ATMs announced it would be installing 100 machines across the country. However, the company's website is frustratingly information-free, with a broken contact form and non-functional email address.  So we were a little skeptical when we saw this story in the Australian media earlier this week, promising ATM installations ""within days"". The CEO of the other company mentioned in the story, Robert Masters of Krypto Currency Solutions, was more helpful, telling us his company had indeed secured locations and would be unveiling machines very soon, but not this week.  The company also made the following announcement: ""Krypto Currency Solutions Pty Ltd. have reached an agreement on a merger and acquisition with ABA Technologies Pty Ltd. for national and international roll out of bitcoin ATMs and related services.""  In the end, it was BitRocket Capital who delivered the goods with a Lamassu installation in a Sydney cafe on Thursday. The machine has a few quirks: it accepts Australian dollars but converts them to USD value to purchase bitcoins.  It also has a $10,000 BTC-equivalent withdrawal limit to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. BitRocket says it wants to install at least 20 more machines in public places, and also has plans to expand overseas.

42425575,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZF1h,1396025842,"Kim Dotcom Launches Political Party, Proposes National Cryptocurrency","Tech entrepreneur and web bad boy Kim Dotcom is back in the news, having announced the launch of the Internet Party.  This is not a joke: Dotcom wants to launch a legitimate political party in New Zealand and one of his stated goals involves the creation of a new cryptocurrency in the island nation.  Kim Dotcom does have rather a chequered past that could get in the way of his political leanings, however.  His rise to fame started in the ’90s, when he was convicted for computer fraud and espionage in his native Germany. His hacking days are now long over, however, and he is best known for starting file-sharing site Megaupload, which was later rebranded and re-launched as Mega.  That wasn't enough for US law enforcement and Big Content, though, so he still battling extradition to the US on copyright-infringement charges related to the site.  Dotcom is quite a personality too: an Internet entrepreneur, singer, ex-hacker and for a while he was the number-one ranked Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 player in the world.  Since he is rather tall and a tad overweight, he is often described as the world's 'largest' tech entrepreneur. Now he can add 'politician fighting extradition' to his list of accomplishments.  Down-to-earth policies  Dotcom appears to be quite serious about the Internet Party. At a press conference he described it as a political movement for the freedom of the Internet and technology, as well as for privacy and political reform.  The party does not have a manifest just yet, but Dotcom says it is on the way. For the time being, his vision is outlined on the party's website. If you are expecting a utopian wish-list instead of a political platform, you may be in for a surprise.  The Internet Party is proposing sensible policies aimed at creating more high-tech jobs in New Zealand, boosting R&D investment and start-ups, eliminating monopolies held by Internet service providers, and strengthening New Zealand's independence from foreign political and corporate interest.  The Internet Party says it will fight against mass surveillance, work to modernise schools with more technology, reform copyright laws to promote fair use and reward content creators, thus attracting new businesses to New Zealand.  New Zealand altcoin  Lastly, Dotcom's party would like to introduce a government-sponsored digital currency in New Zealand. It has nothing to do with ideology – the party believes it would make financial sense and generate more economic growth:  ""The Internet Party will support the introduction of a New Zealand-sponsored digital currency that is safe, secure and encrypted, providing for instant international transactions at minimal cost. By becoming a digital currency leader, New Zealand can become a key hub for a growing financial sector.""  This idea does raise an interesting point. What if a government, any government, decided to launch a cryptocurrency, backed by its national currency, with a decentralised infrastructure and centralised management? It sounds like a tantalizing concept and it's not every day that we hear someone advocating for a government-issued cryptocurrency.  Many still believe digital currencies need to remain independent and unregulated, and that they must transcend national borders. There are increasingly attempts to create local or national digital currencies, with Iceland's auroracoin leading the way.  However, media attention did not help auroracoin take off. In fact, it is starting to look like a lemon, as its price tanked by 50% after the 'Airdrop' to Icelandic citizens.  Just another publicity stunt?  Dotcom's larger-than-life persona attracts the tabloids, and his stunts appeal to many geeks, hence they are good for business.  However, he has a lot of detractors, too. He is a controversial figure, both in Germany, the US and New Zealand. While many Kiwis support him, others believe his ongoing legal battle against extradition is bad for the country's image abroad.  Since Dotcom is not a citizen, he cannot run for office himself. What's more, New Zealand already has a number of small political parties – quite a bit more than you would expect to find in a nation of 4.5 million inhabitants.  ""Minority political parties are 10 a penny in New Zealand and I doubt this one will attract much more attention,"" veteran NZ tech journalist Nick Farrell told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Dotcom is [either] seen as a hero or hated in New Zealand, so it is hard to see how he will make much headway.""  Stunt or not, Dotcom doesn't mind the limelight and his calls for the creation of a government-backed cryptocurrency will probably spark yet another debate on the role of government and the future of digital currencies.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | AIRDROP,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/28/kim-dotcom-launches-political-party-proposes-national-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15c75f1f575a16a07b370465dbff98b1635aae6b-1035x688.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42425577,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZF5h,1396017990,UBS: Banks Could 'Absorb the Benefits' of Bitcoin,"Global financial services firm UBS, a leading provider of retail and commercial banking services, released an extensive report on 28th March that weighed in on bitcoin's potential to disrupt the existing financial system.  Entitled 'Bitcoins and Banks', the report concluded that bitcoin is not just a 'problematic currency' – though this garnered a mention in the headline, but more interestingly, a technology that could bring widespread benefits if co-opted by the traditional banking system.  The 31-page write-up suggested that bitcoin, as a currency or an alternative to traditional banking, poses little threat to traditional institutions, but that the underlying technology could be used to improve global payment systems provided the right business incentives could be identified.  Wrote UBS:  ""Setting aside its political agenda, we see Bitcoin as having some potential as a new transaction technology, where a bitcoin-like technology could provide a basis for a new shared payments and transfer system using existing currencies and securities. Such a system could reduce systemic costs, and provide faster, secure, transfers – particularly in the international arena.""  Though it was careful to describe such hypotheticals as ""blue-sky ideas"", the bank noted that the distributed block chain ""offers a robust and secure way of storing consumer funds"", and that current issues such as the computational intensity bitcoin requires are merely ""quirks"" inherent in the first implementations that could later be improved.  Further, it suggested that banks could benefit from realizing the technological implications of bitcoin:  ""Rather than trying to develop a completely new financial system as Bitcoin is trying to do, it makes more sense that banks, as existing money managers, absorb the benefits of the technological innovation.""  Bitcoin technology has bright future  UBS noted that the block chain could just as easily use existing fiat currencies, and that such a system ""offers a radical opportunity to drastically reduce duplication in the existing system"".  It even went so far as to offer an example of what this reimagined financial system would look like, describing a system whereby banks across the world maintained a ledger that kept track of public addresses and balances.  Wrote UBS:  ""Customers have control of their private keys, possibly with the option of authorizing their banks to handle their keys for them as well, while keeping the customer front-end broadly similar (i.e. with bank account numbers, etc).""  Derivatives and swaps could be attractive for banks  The report found bitcoin the currency most appealing for banks when used as an investment service, similar to an ETF, mentioning specifically the model suggested by the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.  In these instances, the authors noted that banks would not have to expose themselves to market risk, money laundering or other potential negatives.  Bitcoin derivatives, it said, could prove attractive, provided banks were allowed to legally participate in this sector. Further, the report stated that this could help reduce bitcoin's volatility, while providing banks a source of fee revenue.  It seemed to suggested that this avenue would likely be one of the next ways the traditional financial system could look to safely explore alternative currencies and their market implications.  Credit card fees are more at risk  UBS suggested that the bigger risk was that a third party set up a ""bitcoin-like payment system"" that threatens to bring down credit card and money wire fees.  The report noted that cross-border transfers take days, whereas with the bitcoin block chain, they can take minutes. Further, it noted that bitcoin the technology has implemented security improvements that traditional service providers would need to adjust to.  ""On a national level, a bitcoin-like system could enhance security and reduce fraud on an everyday level. In the US in particular, credit cards are regularly used for everyday transactions for convenience – but this leaves both the merchant and the banks open to risks of chargebacks.""  Banks, it noted, could adapt these advantages of the bitcoin system, but that they may be hesitant to do so as it would cannibalize current revenue.  ""A possible incentive for banks to develop such a system would be increased money transfer volumes sufficient to offset decreased fees, or if costs are lowered enough to still boost profits, but any such projection would be highly speculative at this stage.""  Merchant acceptance has little appeal  UBS also took on the question of whether bitcoin the currency represents any cost savings for merchants. To tackle this question, it looked at the daily fees paid out to miners as a percentage of transaction volume, noting it has fluctuated over the last 15 months.  During this study period, it indicated that the 30-day moving average for these costs was 4%, though this excludes the added 1% fee merchants would need to pay to convert money to fiat.  ""While these figures are more or less in line with credit card fees (which range from 1% to 3%), since the beginning of 2014, the rate has trended upwards and been significantly more volatile – peaking at 8.3% at the beginning of February.""  Notably, the report, as many other recent attempts on the subject, doesn't take into account the services of companies like BitPay and Coinbase which handle such transactions directly; nor did it mention the success being enjoyed by early adopters such as Overstock and TigerDirect.  Disintermediation risk is low  Still, while UBS believes bitcoin the technology is promising, bitcoin the currency was given a thorough critique. In particular, UBS indicated that bitcoin ""exists in a regulatory vacuum"", which is damaging to its global trust.  UBS indicated that smaller, local banks, particularly in emerging markets and countries with high economic turmoil faced the biggest threat from bitcoin the currency, but that economic turmoil is already a threat to traditional banking services, even without bitcoin.  Said UBS:  ""Without these stress factors, we see little threat from bitcoin.""  UBS noted that even those who used bitcoin the currency for transactions would likely require banking services such as deposits and lending from traditional outlets. It predicted that in the face of this pressure, either bitcoin would fail, or a bitcoin bank would emerge, which it suggested may be counterintuitive to its goal.  Still, the report noted that among certain groups, such as China (with its strict capital controls) and among libertarian thinkers, the bitcoin's pros could outweigh the cons. Such examples were noted as part of a larger, three-part section that analyzed bitcoin as a store of value, means of exchange and unit of account.

42425580,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZFFh,1396009388,New Active Trading Bitcoin Fund Seeks UK Investors,"A new bitcoin investment fund, which will actively trade the bitcoin markets, will soon launch in London.  The Bitcoin Superfund will use a combination of algorithmic and human trading to achieve a higher rate of return than a simple ‘buy-and-hold’ strategy, its founders claim.  There is no specific launch date at present, but the Superfund is in the process of identifying institutional and high-net-worth investors to reach a target of £5m ($8.3m) under management at launch.  Don’t just hold, trade  Rival bitcoin investment funds already exist, notably the Exante Bitcoin Fund and SecondMarket, but Bitcoin Superfund CEO Greg Jarrett is dismissive of the challenge that they pose, saying, “I don’t really think either of them are competitive.”  Over the past year the value of bitcoin has skyrocketed, even taking into account its relative decline since last December. Many people have bought into bitcoin in the hope that another similar rise will come in future. But if the price remains relatively flat, active trading is needed, says Jarrett:  “If bitcoin becomes a sideways market, which it seems to have done, something that we’re doing becomes very attractive, trading the volatility.”  The Superfund’s figures suggest that its trading strategies would result in a 70% higher rate of return than simply relying on bitcoin appreciation.  However, its figures are drawn from applying trading strategies retroactively for the period December 2012 to February 2014 (4,068% vs. 6,818% for BTC appreciation vs. Superfund appreciation + alpha, respectively).  Jarrett says trading is now live with a test fund, into which he has invested $30,000 of his own money.  The Superfund team  Unlike the Winklevoss twins, whose announcement of their as-yet unlaunched bitcoin fund was just another quirky twist in their very public lives, Jarrett and his co-founder are relative unknowns.  Jarrett’s background  is in mobile product design, and the slick Bitcoin Superfund website is evidence of that.  His co-founder is hedge fund manager at a firm that currently oversees more than £1.3bn ($2.16bn). For now he wished to remain anonymous, however, as he is yet to leave the firm.  The Superfund intends to be based offshore, says Jarrett:  “We’ve been looking at places like Malta. It’s unlikely to be specifically a UK-regulated fund.”  However, the fund is seeking Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approval to operate in the UK, but with the FCA yet to issue any definitive statement on bitcoin, it is unclear how long this will take or if it will be possible.  Jarrett is optimistic that the FCA will engage positively with bitcoin when it does finally make a public statement:  “I think it will be unlikely that a massively negative view is taken on [bitcoin]. I’d be surprised if they came out with regulation that would shut down a massive potential industry that’s steaming ahead very quickly.”  The Bitcoin Superfund also says it has “fully insured cold-wallet storage”, but Jarrett declined to name the insurer and said “our compliance advisors are assisting us with the set-up of this agreement”, suggesting that the insurance may not be currently be in place.  UK-based Elliptic Vault is currently the only confirmed insured business providing cold storage.  Big ambitions  The Superfund is aiming to have £5m under management when it launches. Within three years, it’s aiming to increase that tenfold to £50m, says Jarrett:  “We want to go big, pretty fast.”  His vision of a bitcoin investment fund is one where investors can move money in and out in any currency they like; where any exchanges used by the fund are fully audited; and where special agreements with exchanges ring-fence the fund’s money in case an exchange experiences problems.  Whether all of this is achievable remains to be seen, but Bitcoin Superfund’s ambitions reflect not only the growing institutional interest in bitcoin, but also the recognition of the need for better exchange security.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/28/new-active-trading-bitcoin-fund-seeks-uk-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/830616416f0d698b821528130a948564d429a18f-1024x768.gif?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425587,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZFRh,1396005847,"Dogecoin's Jackson Palmer on Fast Transactions, Many Tips and Much Inflation","Dogecoin is an unlikely cryptocoin experiment that, against the odds, has taken off – mainly as a digital tipping tool for sending tiny amounts of value.  It wasn't some loss of faith in government money systems that created dogecoin, and it certainly didn't have anything to do with a hell-bent drive for profit.  It came from a desire to learn, and a need to share, which are principles that pretty much built the Internet in the first place.  Dogecoin might be the blueprint for how to make a true microtransactional cryptocurrency, a next-gen coin that could compliment bitcoin payments.  That's a speculative guess at what the future holds for an altcoin with a Shiba Inu dog face as its thematic focal point.  But what is not conjecture is that people sure do like to spend tiny bits of dogecoin.  The catalyst  Jackson Palmer, the altcoin's founder, told CoinDesk that the idea of dogecoin came from his appreciation for what feathercoin had been doing:  ""I found the feathercoin community kind of friendlier [than bitcoin]. They’re just really welcoming,"" he said.  An article about doge, written by Gawker's Adrian Chen, really solidified what the meme was all about in Jackson's mind. Doge has a sort of innocence that cannot be tarnished, Chen said.  Palmer explained that ""a lot of other memes can be taken and made to back some other vicious message. With doge you can’t. It’s impossible to insert that into the meme because of the doge face. It’s kind of a pure meme.""    Investing in Dogecoin, pretty sure it’s the next big thing. http://t.co/yHR4bNv6OD      — Jackson Palmer (@jacksonpalmer) November 28, 2013    That initial tweet interested dogecoin co-founder Billy Markus when he heard about it, and he got in touch with Palmer to help make the actual cryptocurrency happen.  ""We launched [dogecoin] and we were just like, it will fizzle out in three days, nobody will be interested,"" Palmer said.  That's not what happened, though. Doge has quickly grown as a tipping method across the Internet and a brand new digital market has thus developed. Said Palmer:  ""Dogecoin, to a certain degree, is testing what happens when you have a more approachable mascot as the face of your coin.""  The rise of the tip  Dogecoin is being used mostly for small transactions, as a way to show deference for something. Many in the community accept dogecoin tips, and it seems people are willing to oblige.  According to BitInfoCharts, dogecoin averages 800 transactions per hour, and 19,000 over a 24-hour period – which is second only to bitcoin. And dogecoin has only existed since December.  Palmer likened the dogecoin tip as a new way to share or 'like' something on the Internet. He's concluded that's the dogecoin sweet spot:  ""It’s about enabling these frictionless microtransactions. I think that’s where dogecoin fits in,"" he said.  And dogecoin is doing many more transactions than its block chain is showing. Social media ecosystems are acting as a top layer to enable more transactions than dogecoin can handle, according to Palmer:  ""Microtransactions have to take place in the Reddit and Twitter tip bots 'off chain' as the protocol has scalability issues with lots and lots of tiny amounts rapidly firing.""  Bter  and Cryptsy are the two largest exchanges trading dogecoin in a BTC/DOGE pair, while Vault of Satoshi has a fiat currency exchange for that accepts the altcoin.  Palmer said that most people get introduced to doge through tips:  ""A lot of people have never had to buy dogecoin. They’ve posted a hilarious picture on Reddit, and they’ve gotten 1000 doge. Which they then tip on to their friends.""  Accidental inflation  After dogecoin reaches block 600,000 later this year, it will hit 100 billion coins mined. At that point, there will be a static block reward per block of 10,000 doge. That's about 5bn additional dogecoin per year.  ""It’s deflationary inflation,"" said Palmer. And it all came by accident, according to him:  ""This inflationary thing was really a bug in the code. It extended out of [co-founder] Billy and I not having a good understanding of what one of the variables, max money, actually means.""  A lively discussion about what to do after the 600,000th block has been raging on dogecoin's GitHub repo over the last few months.  The consensus was that dogecoin should be used as a test bed, to see what happens when mining reaches a certain limit on block rewards.  ""A lot of people were pro-inflation,"" said Palmer. ""A lot of people were saying ‘leave this in’. Because we don’t know what’s going to happen when bitcoin hits its cap.""  The founders and doge community at large don't seem to think that transaction fees could ever sustain dogecoin. That's the reason for the 10,000 doge static blocks. Said Palmer:  ""The reason we decided to leave this in is incentive: [to] leave some incentive for miners to continue securing the network.""  A scalability experiment  Dogecoin and other alternative cryptocurrencies are a proving ground for testing new ideas. That the Auroracoin founder is supplying all Icelanders with free digital currency, in an effort to raise awareness of that country's currency controls, is another example of this.  Palmer said:  ""Altcoins are a really great way for the cryptocurrency industry to experiment. Because obviously we can’t change the bitcoin protocol outright.""  Dogecoin's one-minute block generation time is far faster than that of bitcoin. Palmer, although he didn't set out to do so, now aims to answer questions scalability.  ""What kind of scalability issues do you encounter when you are doing thousands upon thousands of microtransactions a day?"" he said. ""These are scalability issues that just don’t exist, that bitcoiners have not come across.""  An example of this is 'bitcoinj' – a Java implementation of the Bitcoin protocol – which developers have ported over to dogecoin for its Android wallet.  However, when used with the high-volume transactions of dogecoin, it can freeze up. This was something that was brought to the attention of Mike Hearn, who confirmed that too many transactions going through the client is an issue that bitcoinj has to address.  Palmer doesn't necessarily think that modifications that are found to improve dogecoin will be implemented into the bitcoin core.  He does think, though, that things like BitPay's node implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, Bitcore, is an example of innovating on top of bitcoin. He said:  ""I think what you’ll find is people taking the learnings and then porting them back into new implementations that vendors can use. Bitcore is a fine example of that.""  A friendlier coin  Dogecoin is a fascinating experiment that is helping to further advance the revolutionary aspects of decentralized money.  But it is doing so by building a community of small spenders. Doge is not just made up of developers and speculators that have built up somewhat of an inclusive group, according to Palmer:  ""It can be pretty rough in the cryptocurrency world. If you come across as not understanding something, you get shouted at. And it’s not the right way to go about it.""  Doge's successful emergence could be attributed to hitting the scene at just the right moment. Back in mid-December, the price of bitcoin was slipping after an all-time high.  ""I think there was a lot of negativity and a lot of angst in the bitcoin community,"" Palmer said.  Along comes this altcoin with a doge face on it, and it brightened people's perceptions of cryptocurrencies. ""People were being friendly to one another. I think people took some solace in that,"" he said.  Dogecoin has hit demographics that other coins haven't been able to touch. That includes women, high schoolers and anyone who loves the idea of memes.  Basically, it appeals to people that aren't really concerned about cryptography or the future of money. And stories like a NASCAR driver receiving sponsorship funds via dogecoin, or Indian Winter Olympians being helped to Sochi, perpetuates the viral impact.  And what's still remarkable is that it all started with a simple Twitter status update. ""There was no master plan,"" Palmer says. ""A lot of people are like: 'Oh you’re in marketing. This must have been something that you thought about for weeks and architected'.""  ""And I’m like, no, it was a tweet, on a whim.""

42377050,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4WX,1396001951,"KnCMiner Updates Titan Spec, Promises 250MH/s","KnCMiner has bumped up the specification of its upcoming Titan scrypt miner. The Swedish mining rig manufacturer now claims its Titan model will deliver at least 250MH/s.  It's an unexpected announcement, given the fact that the Titan was announced just a week ago and that the original spec promised a 100MH/s device.  KnCMiner  told CoinDesk that the typical GPU used for scrypt mining today delivers less than 1% of the Titan. For example, an overclocked Radeon R9 290X usually delivers about 1MH/s.  The R9 290X is currently the fastest Radeon card on the market, although AMD is expected to announce a dual-GPU card in a matter of days. It should be noted that dual-GPU cards tend to offer a somewhat inferior price/performance compared to single-GPU cards, but since the dual-GPU R9 295 has not been announced, we can only speculate at this point.  Same price, more speed  The difference does not end there. The R9 290X is not nearly as frugal as scrypt ASICs. The card is based on AMD's latest Hawaii GPU, which just happens to be the biggest GPU in the company's history.  With 6.2bn transistors on a die measuring 438mm2, the chip is substantially bigger than the Tahiti GPU, used in HD 7900-series cards, which measures 365mm2 and packs 4.3bn transistors. Both parts are manufactured on TSMC's 28nm node.  As a result, the peak power consumption of the R9 290X is close to 300W, even without overclocking. That's just the card though, the overall system power draw is even higher, depending on the configuration. KnCMiner says the Titan will need an 800-1000W power supply, which is very encouraging, as it is roughly in the ballpark of a GPU mining rig with two R9 290X cards.  The company says it will not be increasing the price, which stands at $9,995.  Don't forget about Alpha  Alpha Technology  is working on scrypt miners of its own. In fact, it announced its first products months ahead of KnCMiner.  The company recently revised its spec, too. Alpha was originally planning to offer 25MH/s and 5MH/s miners, but earlier this month it said the rigs would deliver 90MH/s and 16MH/s respectively.  However, the latest announcement from KnCMiner has probably raised a few eyebrows at Alpha. The company priced its 90MH/s miner at about $9,000, while the 16MH/s unit should cost $2,200.  Alpha Technologies told us to expect 10W per 1MH/s, which was a great improvement over its original spec. However, that means Alpha's 90MH/s miner will end up at 900W, although the company says it is trying to improve efficiency and bring it down to 750W.  Following its latest announcement, KnCMiner appears to have an upper hand both in terms of value and efficiency. KnCMiner says it already has $2m worth of pre-orders for the Titan and it hopes to build 2,500 units in its first batch. The volume of Alpha's orders remains unclear.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/28/kncminer-updates-titan-spec-promises-250mhs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9701d4e579b1dbde98f0bb68e47a091c41045cc9-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377060,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4j7,1395978347,PocketPOS Launches to Remove Bitcoin Pain Points for Canadian Merchants,"Merchants in Canada can now tap into a newly launched tool that allows them to accept payments in bitcoin at the point of sale - a browser app called PocketPOS.  Businesses can use PocketPOS to conduct transactions through a streamlined point-of-sale interface that does not require hardware installation or management.  PocketPOS  developer Mitchell Callahan told CoinDesk that the tool is designed to appeal to merchants who aren't tech-savvy, and that it serves as a means for them to not only accept bitcoin, but manage their accounts and interact with an exchange.  Callahan framed PocketPOS as a low-cost point-of-sale solution that would lead to wider bitcoin adoption by Canadian merchants, who he believes want to accept bitcoin but have been discouraged by existing methods.  Explained Callahan:  ""I wanted an easy way to sign up merchants [to accept bitcoin], and I found most people were using kind of a mish-mash of software, and it wasn't as simple as it could be.""  PocketPOS officially launched on 26th March.  How PocketPOS works  PocketPOS is free, but interested merchants need to first sign up for a merchant account with Calgary-based bitcoin exchange provider VirtEx.  From there, using PocketPOS only requires an Internet connection, according to Callahan:  ""We wanted to get away from the traditional model of, you know, having to buy hardware [or] having any high set-up costs. It's all browser-based so you only need an internet-connected device.""  He added: ""So, if you have an old iPhone kicking around, tablet or an even a desktop computer with a screen - that's all you need.""  Once enrolled, merchants receive a special URL that allows them to conduct transactions. Merchants then enter the transaction amount (including tip if applicable) and, once configured, the tool creates a QR code.  PocketPOS can also be used to generate and send receipts to customers.  Unlike its competitors, Callahan says PocketPOS boasts a device-agnostic platform that doesn't require users to be logged into any service, which in turn bolsters security.  Available alternatives  Currently, Callahan indicated that most stores in Canada that accept bitcoin, do so using a combination of Blockchain.info and a desktop wallet. Alternatively, merchants can use BitPay or VirtEx's merchant tools.  PocketPOS adds additional top layer functionality to this latter option. The company uses VirtEx as a processor, harnessing the power of the same API it uses to allow online merchants to accept BTC.  The difference, Callahan notes, is that with PocketPOS, merchants can manage security and fiat conversions.  Said Callahan:  ""Currently, without PocketPOS, if you're a VirtEx merchant, all you can do is email invoices. This isn't a great solution for a retail location.""  Room for growth  Looking to the future, Callahan said that the PocketPOS team is considering several different funding models as they expand the scope of project. Callahan also indicated he is open to adding support for additional digital currencies.  However, he said that for now the focus will remain on offering merchants the ability to accept bitcoin without having to pay high processing fees.  He pointed to broad support among merchants in Canada, as well as existing demand for software that they can easily integrate.  ""Being a business owner, I know that transactions are big, [as are] bookkeeping and reporting, so we might just have an option to pay five bucks a month and [and allow users to] export to Quickbooks or another system.""  Bitcoin in Canada  Earlier this year, recently resigned Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said that he would move to regulate bitcoin and other digital currencies, an announcement that many believed indicated harsh measures might soon be imposed on the technology.  However, more recently, that narrative seems to have changed.  This week, Canada-based bitcoin exchange Vault of Satoshi announced that it had been granted a full Money Services Business license from the Canadian government, and revealed plans to obtain further licensure in its bid for legal legitimacy.
