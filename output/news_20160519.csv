42426899,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxS9h,1463688762,Russia's 'Bitcoin Ban' Faces Uncertain Future After Draft Bill Withdrawn,"A bill prepared by Russia's Ministry of Finance targeting the creation and circulation of so-called money surrogates, a classification that would include digital currencies like bitcoin, has been at least temporarily withdrawn from consideration following comments from the country’s Justice Ministry.  As reported by regional news source RNS last week, the bill – popularly known as the ""Russian bitcoin ban"" – received some negative feedback after the Justice Ministry is said to have objected to the bill on the grounds that its comments were not incorporated. The national legislature, the Duma, has been deliberating the bill since earlier this year.  Up for debate is the extent to which those who issue or circulate private monies in Russia will be punished. Reports out of Russia have indicated that some advocates are pushing for multi-year jail sentences and fines, though the latest news points to disagreements among some in government about how to approach regulation for the technology.  Observers have suggested that defects within the bill may have doomed it from the start.  In statements, Nikita Soshnikov, partner at Moscow-based Tolkachev and Partners Law Firm, called the bill ""poorly drafted"".  Soshnikov told CoinDesk:  ""The [Finance] Ministry has not provided [the] appropriate justification for criminalization of cryptocurrencies and its public danger (as an essential criterion for criminalization). The draft is broadly worded, therefore, wide range of activities regarding e-currencies can potentially fall within proposed 'money surrogates' definition.""  Additionally, according to Soshnikov, the bill itself was said to have contained redundancies that sparked criticism from the Justice Ministry.  ""[The] Russian Ministry of Justice stated that Russian Criminal Code already provides for similar regulations that criminalize illegal turnover of means of payment,"" he said.  Bill's future unclear  Soshnikov went on to say that it was ""unsurprising"" that the bill had attracted criticism from the Justice Ministry, a move that he said was likely to postpone further debate or passage of the bill for the foreseeable future.  ""It is unclear when the proposed draft will be submitted to the State Duma and hopefully [it] will be subject to further public discussions,” he said.  One other possible wrinkle in the debate, as suggested by comments provided to CoinDesk, is whether digital currencies should be treated separately from non-financial applications of the blockchain. The Russian Finance Ministry has indicated its desire to take this approach in the past, even while other officials, including those from the country’s central bank, have previously indicated it may not support this approach.  Alexey Troshichev, blockchain architect for domestic payment processing services Qiwi, suggested that restrictions on certain aspects of the technology would impair genuine innovation.  ""How [will] startups, how [will] other companies will experiment if they won't be allowed to buy bitcoins?"" Troshichev told CoinDesk.  He cautioned that those in the global community should realize that the discussions in region remain broad, and that understanding that the technologies are linked is coming gradually.  He concluded:  ""This is [at the] very early stage. It arrives at the question that we should unite and discuss them as a whole, not just separately.""

42426911,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxSTh,1463684920,Coinbase Exchange to Rebrand Following Ethereum Trading Launch,"Bitcoin exchange and wallet service Coinbase is adding support for ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network.  The addition of Ethereum comes amid rising interest in ether among digital currency traders and the technology platform itself among financial institutions and other enterprises worldwide. Trading will begin on 24th May.  Further, Coinbase's exchange service will be rebranded with a new name and logo, according to vice president of business development Adam White.  White told CoinDesk:  ""In addition to better highlighting the exchange that Coinbase is becoming we’re rebranding as GDAX, which stands for Global Digital Asset Exchange.""  Initially, traders on Coinbase's exchange platform will be able to buy and sell ethers. Later this summer, the company will add support for the digital currency to all Coinbase users.  An official announcement is expected to be made Tuesday. In interview, White confirmed the added support for ether after details about the integration began circulating on social media.  Changing landscape  Coinbase's ether integration was, in some ways, largely expected given recent trends in the exchange space.  Since San Francisco-based exchange Kraken announced last August that it would become the first major venture-backed business to offer ether trading pairs, a variety of exchanges worldwide have followed suit in the past few months. More recently, Gemini added ether trading pairs to its exchange.  According to White, members of the Coinbase team have long stayed apprised of development on Ethereum, largely through conversations with the network's creator, Vitalik Buterin, as well as media reports.  Last year, employees took part in multiple Ethereum meetups as part of their research into the digital currency, said White. But it wasn’t until Microsoft Azure entered the fray that the startup begin to look more closely, said White.  The result: Coinbase employees began building services on top of Ethereum, including wallets. At the same time, explained White, the company's customer base voiced ""unprecedented"" support for the digital currency through email and social media, ultimately spurring this week's announcement.  ""We’ve always focused on bitcoin because that’s been the most popular but as other currencies come on line we always evaluate them,"" said White. ""When ether came online it was a no-brainer.""  Interest in other assets  White also suggested that the company was paying close attention to The DAO, a decentralized organization built on top of Ethereum that acts as a funding vehicle for related projects.  Specifically, Coinbase employees are keeping a close eye on the tokens associated with The DAO, which are used as both a voting mechanism as well as a method of generating rewards for stakeholders.  ""I’d be remiss to say we’re not investigating that,"" said White. ""But there are a number of legal and business questions we’re trying to answer.""  White concluded:  ""That doesn’t mean we’re going to add 15 new currencies over the coming weeks, but we’re paying attention.""

42426898,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxS7h,1463671838,Sydney Stock Exchange Developing Blockchain Trading System,"A stock exchange in Australia is developing a private equity market solution using blockchain technology.  As reported by the Sydney Morning Herald, the Sydney Stock Exchange (SSX) will initially look to facilitate the trade of private stocks, but will eventually open the system up to publicly traded stocks as well. The project brings to mind Linq, the blockchain project developed by securities exchange operator Nasdaq in partnership with blockchain startup Chain.  Loretta Joseph, the lead SSX consultant working on the project, told the Morning Herald:  ""We will start with a private secondary equity market for venture capital and crowdfunded startups to register on our exchange. We will then move to a public secondary market. VC and crowdfunding are private little markets. It will give them another market that they can come to.""  According to the report, the project has been in development for year, but recent moves by the government encouraged SSX to push ahead on the initiative. Statements from the exchange’s leadership indicate that it intends to both use the solution internally as well as market it to other exchanges.  By planning to integrate blockchain tech into its systems, SSX becomes the second notable securities exchange in Australia to seek to adopt the technology.  The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has been working on its own solution in partnership with New York-based startup Digital Asset Holdings. The exchange was also an investor in Digital Asset’s recent $60m funding round.  The move comes during a formative time for the technology in Australia. Earlier this year, the government gave its effective stamp of approval through public statements on such projects, stating the intention to develop new legal frameworks for blockchains.

42426912,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxSXh,1463670958,The Law of The DAO,"The DAO leapt into the headlines earlier this month after it captured nearly $150m in funding, constituting almost 12% of the total amount of ether tokens in the Ethereum network.  The DAO’s structure attempts to emulate the behavior of a crowdfunding business entity, and allows its investors to choose how The DAO will invest the collective ether (ETH) contributions among specific target projects.  The idea and structure of The DAO presents significant legal challenges. Specifically, courts will be forced to grapple with the implications of a web of contracts imitating an entity, instead of a legally incorporated entity.  The law is simply unprepared for DAOs. However, based upon the structure of The DAO, it is foreseeable that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would view its tokens purchased by investors as a security or investment contract, subject to its jurisdiction.  The voting system implemented for The DAO is likewise problematic due to its mixed incentives and propensity to depress the value of ETH and its own tokens. Because investment in The DAO is laden with risk and seems to implicate SEC jurisdiction, The DAO may attract regulatory attention.  What is a DAO? What is The DAO?  The DAO is an example of a decentralized or distributed autonomous organization (“DAO”). Generally speaking, DAOs are structures that use smart contracts to provide additional features and functionality to blockchains.  Implementations of DAOs, like The DAO, can include sophisticated arrangements of rights and powers encoded through smart contracts that emulate the attributes and activities of business entities or regulated financial contracts, including insurance, futures, options, etc. The DAO is attempting to emulate a crowdfunding entity where its backers vote to choose on which project The DAO’s aggregate investment should be spent.  DAOs are said to offer advantages to conventional business entities because (a) their activities are limited to that of the code used to operate them, (b) all terms, conditions, and governance are expressly disclosed to the investors, and (c) DAOs are based on blockchains, which generally provide increased transparency.  The DAO is intended to three primary functions. First, it is expressly intended to aggregate investor assets by taking ETH in exchange for DAO tokens. Second, it enters into contracts to use the ETH invested for projects selected by investor vote. Third, it pays returns on those investments back to DAO token holders.  As stated in the organization's manifesto:  ""The goal of The DAO is to diligently use the ETH it controls to support projects that will: …[p]rovide a return on investment or benefit to the DAO and its members.""  Traditional business entities exist as a result of legislation permitting groups of actors to shift risk and obtain legal protection by incorporating. In exchange for these privileges, groups of individuals operating as entities must comply with financial and operational restraints imposed by the State. Unlike conventional business entities, DAOs exist only within their own blockchains, and are generally unable to interact with the outside financial and/or regulatory actors. As a result, DAOs are reliant upon outside information in order to act.  The DAO is structured to include four types of actors: the creators of the platform, the curators, the contractors, and the DAO token holders (i.e. investors). The creators of the platform wrote open-source code that allows The DAO to function and that anyone can freely use. Investors (also called DAO token holders) in The DAO obtain stakes in The DAO by exchanging ETH for DAO tokens. Along with these tokens investors are granted voting rights.  Contractors then offer proposals which are potential investments for The DAO’s accumulated ETH assets, along with clear payment terms in the form of a return on The DAO’s investment. Curators in-turn verify and ""whitelist"" proposals without providing opinions as to the merits of any proposal. The DAO thus requires external inputs in the form of investor capital, investor voting participation, the supply of project information from contractors, and the approval of projects by curators.  Will the law recognize The DAO?  DAOs are not currently recognized legal actors in the US. This creates uncertainty for legal actions brought against a DAO, and the legal rights of a DAO. It is unclear whether the actions of a DAO would be attributed to the creators of that DAO, those who maintain that DAO, those who suggest projects, or those who have invested in a DAO. Although it may be helpful for a DAO to designate a human representative, DAO token holders may choose not to disclose an owner or primary actor.  If a lawsuit were filed against a DAO, it would stall immediately because of the difficulty of identifying a party who represents the DAO to serve with process. A plaintiff would need to verify that the person is appropriate to represent the DAO, and prove that the person falls within the jurisdiction of the court. Any party served with legal process on behalf of a DAO would likely seek to quash service on the basis that they are not an authorized representative of the DAO. The court would then need to determine what is a DAO in a legal context.  As litigation lawyer Steven Palley suggests, DAOs would likely be considered general partnership or joint ventures, resulting in any participant being a representative of the DAO’s interests. Palley’s article earlier this year suggests that DAOs would be considered general partnerships, which would allow a plaintiff to reach individual participants for service and or liability.  Under Palley's theory, anyone suing The DAO could attempt to obtain jurisdiction over the organization by serving any human participant in The DAO. If considered a general partnership, each partner would then be held jointly and severally responsible for all liabilities of the business, and all personal assets of each partner are subject to seizure or lien by creditors. Thus, the parties to a DAO may have unlimited potential liability for the entity’s actions. The lack of regulatory recognition will thus limit the utility of DAOs for risk-mitigation.  Palley’s conclusion is problematic. It suggests that a lawsuit against bitcoin itself might be viable, provided that the digital currency’s creator, a bitcoin core developer, node operator, and/or miner may be served with process, be deemed a representative of the network, and potentially have liability.  If considered a general partnership, a plaintiff could thus serve any participant who benefits from the DAO who is within the geographic scope of the Court’s power. Using pseudo-anonymous blockchains to obtain funding makes identifying and locating investors extremely difficult. Contractors who suggest projects may be easier to identify than any other actors because disclosure of the nature of the project is necessary. If the DAO’s creators, or those who benefit from the DAO, are not located in United States, obtaining judicial redress may be functionally impossible.  Why voting might be The DAO’s Achilles Heel?  Investors in The DAO have voting rights that permit them to collectively determine whether projects are funded. Each investor has a voting share that is proportional to the amount of tokens the investor DAO held. The voting investor has the ability to irrevocably vote once per proposal, and a vote freezes that investor’s DAO tokens. However, for The DAO to engage in any investment activity, at least 20% of its DaoToken holders must vote for the project. This may be a critical vulnerability in The DAO.  ""Accepting a Proposal requires a majority decision after a debating period of two weeks minimum, and a participation rate of 20% or higher calculated proportionally to the value of ETH requested in the Proposal."" As noted by chief technical officer of SteemitDan Larimer, once a party has voted, their ETH is committed to that project until the project is accepted or rejected, which seems to dis-incentivize voting.  Agreeing to fund projects may actually cause a drop in the value of ETH and DaoTokens because a project will require The DAO to transfer ETH to a contractor, who would then likely convert it to fiat currency, which may depress the value of the ETH on open trade markets, which would then reduce the value of The DAO’s ETH holdings. As Larimer suggests ""Every time a project is funded, the amount of ETH backing the DAO tokens falls and is replaced with speculative IOU from a contractor."" Thus, The DAO funding a project may actually cause a reduction in the value of ETH and reduce the value of its own investment base.  Finally, the voting system may be subject to manipulation by disproportionate actors. If a small group of investors hold an aggregate 20.1% share of existing DaoTokens, they could collaborate to force the acceptance of the proposal, irrespective of any other investors’ votes. If less than 20% of the investment value of The DAO actually votes, The DAO will never fund a project.  Why the investment in The DAO is probably a security  The SEC regulates securities or investment contracts, which are defined as an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. In this case, it is likely that investors who purchase or ""create"" DAO tokens with ETH are purchasing securities or investment contracts.  Investors in The DAO pay ETH to ""create"" DAO tokens. Although ETH is not ""money,"" the law suggests that money equivalents qualify as ""money"" for this analysis as long as the investor is subject to financial loss. A court will also examine what was represented to the investor. Thus, if the representations suggest that the investor was promised a return on the investment, and has a risk of loss, then it is likely considered a payment to an investment contract or security.  The DAO clearly promotes the expectation of investors of ETH obtaining returns. ""The goal of The DAO is to diligently use the ETH it controls to support projects that will: …[p]rovide a return on investment or benefit to the DAO and its members;"" ""The DAO then has the option to accumulate this ETH to support its growth, or redistribute it to the [DAO token] Holders as a reward.” The DAO discloses the risk of loss of invested ETH: ""The use of The DAO’s smart contract code and the Creation of [DAO tokens] carries significant financial risk."" But The DAO also clearly represents that investors should expect a return on investment or to receive benefit through the increase of value of the [DAO tokens].  The next prong is commonality of enterprise. Although different courts apply different tests to determine commonality of enterprise, under the tests applied by most courts, the structure of The DAO would be deemed sufficiently common to satisfy this prong of the test.  Finally, The DAO appears to satisfy the requirement that profits derive solely from the efforts of others. The DAO functions to fund projects approved by the investors. Without projects, The DAO does nothing but hold invested ETH pending approval of a project. To determine whether the profits derive from the efforts of others, the court will determine whether the significant, managerial efforts that affect the failure or success of the enterprise are made by those other than the investor. Because The DAO relies upon contractors and their projects to present investment opportunities from which returns or profits may be obtained, this prong is likely also satisfied.  The sale of DAO tokens by The DAO in exchange for ETH carries all of the hallmarks of an investment contract or security, and under this analysis, the SEC could assume jurisdiction over The DAO. The DAO presents novel legal issues, both with respect to its ability to interact with the legal system, and as to the potential regulatory ramifications of investing in a new novel structure.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Andrew Hinkes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/05/19/the-law-of-the-dao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25f6a70fa27c869171dc92d4aa8eeb646763ad40-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426889,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxOrh,1463660896,Apache Foundation Founder Named Hyperledger Executive Director,"There's a new man in charge of the Hyperledger Project, a group of more that 30 companies working together to build an open standard for distributed ledgers across industries.  Announced today, the founder of of the Apache Software Foundation, Brian Behlendorf, joins the open-source project as its first executive director and a batch of new companies joined.  At the top of the open-source veteran's list of priorities as he starts the new job is to make some ""hard decisions"" regarding whether the group's codebase will consist of a single underlying technology or multiple interlocking codebases.  Speaking in interview with CoinDesk, Behlendorf laid out how he hopes the project members will change the way they think about blockchain to help meet a series of pressing goals:  Behlendorf said:  ""For the short term, we’re focused on the use cases around permissioned blockchain, but being very enthusiastic about non-permissioned, seeing it as as spectrum, not a dichotomy.""  The executive director position is newly created and Behlendorf will report directly to the Jim Zemlin, the executive director of Linux Foundation, which oversees the Hyperledger Project.  Behlendorf will also report to the board of directors and indirectly to the Linux Foundation community. Staffers of the Linux Foundation who work on the Hyperledger Project will report to Behlendorf.  Previously, Behlendorf was a primary developer of the Apache Web server and a founder of the Apache Software Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to producing and distributing open-source software under the Apache free software license.  Until recently, Behlendorf was also the managing director of Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management LLC, a technology investment firm. While still at the firm, Behlendorf began researching the viability of several blockchain companies and learning more about the technology. Then Zemlin, his long-time friend, reached out to him to ask for his opinion about Hyperledger.  Behlendorf said:  ""I came to learn that there was a real need for staff to help bridge the companies who wanted to incorporate blockchain in their products and the developers.""  Scratching an itch  To prevent any single member from exercising disproportionate control over the project, Behlendorf says it's important that all members make contributions.  Of Hyperledger’s more than 30 members IBM, Digital Asset Holdings and Blockstream donated code to be used as part of the ""fabric"" of codebases currently being woven together. But, there’s no reason other members might not eventually wish to make similar contributions, each of which will also have their own vested interests to measure.  While Behlendorf acknowledged IBM has ""come to the table with the most energy"", he said Hyperledger members and aren't just ""interested in sponsorship"" but also developing the technology.  Also announced today in a separate release Hyperledger added eight new members to the project.New members are: Beijing AiYi Digital Finance Technology Co. Ltd, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Cloudsoft Corporation Ltd., Coinplug, Cuscal Limited, Eurostep Holdings Ltd., Skry (Coinalytics) and Soramitsu.  Going forward, Behlendorf says he intends to streamline the onboarding process for new members, to make it easier for them to contribute immediately. ""It shouldn’t take three weeks to make your first pull request,"" he said.  Behlendorf told CoinDesk he wants to create an atmosphere at Hyperledger where participants feel they don't have to release press releases for every pull request.  By removing the sense of being under a microscope and making it easier for new partners to contribute, he thinks, he can build a group dynamic of people willing to work for the greater good.  ""We know how to weave together the collective scratch your own itch impulse.""
