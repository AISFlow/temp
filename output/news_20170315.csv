42394589,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDSpL,1489611998,Why Use a Blockchain?,"As the implications of the invention of have become understood, a certain hype has sprung up around blockchain technology.  This is, perhaps, because it is so easy to imagine high-level use cases. But, the technology has also been closely examined: millions of dollars have been spent researching blockchain technology over the past few years, and numerous tests for whether or not blockchain technology is appropriate in various scenarios have been conducted.  Blockchain technology offers new tools for authentication and authorization in the digital world that preclude the need for many centralized administrators. As a result, it enables the creation of new digital relationships.  By formalizing and securing new digital relationships, the blockchain revolution is posed to create the backbone of a layer of the internet for transactions and interactions of value (often called the 'Internet of Value', as opposed to the 'Internet of Information' which uses the client-server, accounts and master copy databases we’ve been using for over the past 20 years.)  But, with all the talk of building the digital backbone of a new transactional layer to the internet, sometimes blockchains, private cryptographic keys and cryptocurrencies are simply not the right way to go.  Many groups have created flowcharts to help a person or entity decide between a blockchain or master copy, client-server database. The following factors are a distillation of much of what has been previously done:  Is the data dynamic with an auditable history?  Paper can be hard to counterfeit because of the complexity of physical seals or appearances. Like etching something in stone, paper documents have certain permanence.  But, if the data is in constant flux, if it is transactions occurring regularly and frequently, then paper as a medium may not be able to keep up the system of record. Manual data entry also has human limitations.  So, if the data and its history are important to the digital relationships they are helping to establish, then blockchains offer a flexible capacity by enabling many parties to write new entries into a system of record that is also held by many custodians.  Should or can the data be controlled by a central authority?  There remain many reasons why a third party should be in charge of some authentications and authorizations. There are times when third-party control is totally appropriate and desirable. If privacy of the data is the most important consideration, there are ways to secure data by not even connecting it to a network.  But if existing IT infrastructure featuring accounts and log-ins is not sufficient for the security of digital identity, then the problem might be solved by blockchain technology.  As Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in his (or her) seminal work, ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"": “Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.”  Private key cryptography enables push transactions, which don't require centralized systems and the elaborate accounts used to establish digital relationships. If this database requires millions of dollars to secure lightweight financial transactions, then there’s a chance blockchains are the solution.  Is the speed of the transaction the most important consideration?  Does this database require high-performance millisecond transactions?  If high performance, millisecond transactions are what is required, then it’s best to stick with a traditional-model centralized system. Blockchains as databases are slow and there is a cost to storing the data – the processing (or 'mining') of every block in a chain. Centralized data systems based on the client-server model are faster and less expensive… for now.  In short, while we still don’t know the full limits and possibilities of blockchains, we can at least say the use cases which have passed inspection have all been about managing and securing digital relationships as part of a system of record.

42394586,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDSf5,1489611952,What Are Blockchain’s Issues and Limitations?,"There are treacherous passes in any technological revolution.  Some people in the blockchain industry have pointed out that blockchain has become overhyped, when, in reality, the technology has limitations and is inappropriate for many digital interactions.  But through research and development, success and failure, and trial and error, we've learned the current issues and limitations of blockchains.  Complexity  Blockchain technology involves an entirely new vocabulary.  It has made cryptography more mainstream, but the highly specialized industry is chock-full of jargon. Thankfully, there are several efforts at providing glossaries and indexes that are thorough and easy to understand.  Network size  Blockchains (like all distributed systems) are not so much resistant to bad actors as they are 'antifragile' – that is, they respond to attacks and grow stronger.  This requires a large network of users, however. If a blockchain is not a robust network with a widely distributed grid of nodes, it becomes more difficult to reap the full benefit.  There is some discussion and debate about whether this a fatal flaw for some permissioned blockchain projects.  Transaction costs, network speed  Bitcoin currently has notable transaction costs after being touted as ‘near free’ for the first few years of its existence.  As of late 2016, it can only process about seven transactions per second, and each transaction costs about $0.20 and can only store 80 bytes of data.  There’s also the politically charged aspect of using the bitcoin blockchain, not for transactions, but as a store of information. This is the question of '‘bloating' and is often frowned upon because it forces miners to perpetually reprocess and rerecord the information.  Human error  If a blockchain is used as a database, the information going into the database needs to be of high quality. The data stored on a blockchain is not inherently trustworthy, so events need to be recorded accurately in the first place.  The phrase 'garbage in, garbage out' holds true in a blockchain system of record, just as with a centralized database.  Unavoidable security flaw  There is one notable security flaw in bitcoin and other blockchains: if more than half of the computers working as nodes to service the network tell a lie, the lie will become the truth. This is called a '51% attack' and was highlighted by Satoshi Nakamoto when he launched bitcoin.  For this reason, bitcoin mining pools are monitored closely by the community, ensuring no one unknowingly gains such network influence.  Politics  Because blockchain protocols offer an opportunity to digitize governance models, and because miners are essentially forming another type of incentivized governance model, there have been ample opportunities for public disagreements between different community sectors.  These disagreements are a notable feature of the blockchain industry and are expressed most clearly around the question or event of 'forking' a blockchain, a process that involves updating the blockchain protocol when a majority of a blockchain's users have agreed to it.  These debates can be very technical, and sometimes heated, but are informative for those interested in the mixture of democracy, consensus and new opportunities for governance experimentation that blockchain technology is opening up.

42399679,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyPCH,1489611619,Delaware is Drafting Law That Would Recognize Blockchain Records,"Delaware is inching closer to using blockchain as a means to create and manage corporate records.  Though the process is in the early stages, a group within the Delaware State Bar Association's Corporation Law Section has released a proposed piece of legislation that would establish a legal basis for using the technology for this purpose. Specifically, it would amend the state's General Corporation Law to account for blockchain use.  The move comes less than a year after Delaware's government, led by the now-former Delaware Governor Jack Markell, unveiled a new project focused on blockchain applications for corporate record-keeping.  The Delaware Blockchain Initiative is backed in part by smart contract startup Symbiont, and those involved have eyed 2017 as the year in which Delaware-based firms may begin to use the tech to retain corporate records.  The proposed bill states:  ""Amendments to Sections 219, 224 and 232 and related provisions are intended to provide specific statutory authority for Delaware corporations to use networks of electronic databases (examples of which are described currently as 'distributed ledgers' or a 'blockchain') for the creation and maintenance of corporate records, including the corporation’s stock ledger.""  The proposed legislation isn’t a done deal, however.  According to law firm Richards, Layton and Finger, which published details of the proposal, the bill is subject to further approval by the Corporation Law Section. Then, it would need to be formally introduced in the Delaware General Assembly (the state's legislature), where it could potentially undergo further changes. But if passed in largely existing form, the new rules would come into affect in August of this year.  That the state would move to experiment with the tech in the area of corporate record-keeping is perhaps unsurprising.  Delaware is a popular site for companies to base their headquarters, accounting for more than half of all Fortune 500 companies according to the state's Economic Development Office.

42399685,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyPJA,1489608365,Ethereum Price Tops $30 to Set New All-Time High,"The price of ether, the token that powers the blockchain-based smart contract platform ethereum, surged to a new all-time high today.  The digital asset, which had been edging up throughout the week, rose to as much as $32.78 on CoinMarketCap today, roughly 15% higher than the session's opening price of $28.65.  At the time of report, ether was trading at a fresh, all-time high.  The move coincides with an overall rise in the cryptocurrency market, which has been climbing in value even after the SEC rejected the proposed Winklevoss ETF, a bitcoin-based retail investment vehicle, last Friday.  In the days following the landmark decision, the value of the digital currency market spiked, adding more than $4bn worth of value through Monday, according to data compiled by CoinDesk.  Ether prices surged during this rally, climbing more than 70% from a low of $17.68 on 10th March to a high of $30.60 on 13th March.  Today, the digital currency's price extended these gains, repeatedly reaching new highs and even testing beyond the $32 level.  Traders seek alternatives  As for why the cryptocurrency space has been generating so much demand – and such robust returns – analysts offered a few different explanations. For starters, bitcoin has been encountering some challenges lately, as the drama surrounding its longstanding scaling dilemma once again dominated the news this week.  Bitcoin's ongoing challenges only make alternatives look more appealing, said cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff.  ""Ethereum remains the top alternative,"" he added.  Market expert Tim Enneking took a slightly different approach, emphasizing the robust returns that traders can obtain with alternative protocol assets, stating:  ""There are far bigger gains to be made nowadays in altcoins than in BTC … Far more money to be made, and more risk, in altcoins!""

42399677,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyPAJ,1489602721,Coinbase to Charge Fees for On-Blockchain Transactions,"Bitcoin and ether exchange startup Coinbase is planning to shift the cost of certain kinds of transaction fees to users later this month.  In a new blog post, the startup cited its subsidization of so-called 'on-chain' transaction fees, noting that it has long paid the cost the network requires to confirm these transfers.  Yet, Coinbase said that this policy has now ""become a significant cost"" and that fees will shift to users looking to send network transactions over the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains beginning 21st March.  Transactions on-site between users will continue to be provided at no cost, the startup added.  Instead, fee amounts will be given when a user is preparing to issue a transaction, according to the firm.  Coinbase product manager Ankur Nandwani wrote in the blog post:  ""Fees will be assigned dynamically based on the current network conditions and will be paid by customers when they send an on-chain transaction.""  The startup outlined other pending service changes in the post, including the shutdown of a feature that enables account access by way of SMS.  Coinbase said that the feature, which dates back to 2013, was more relevant in days before widespread smartphone use, and that it is shifting away from the service in favor of its mobile-based apps. The SMS tool will be taken offline on 21st March.  Coinbase is also shutting down a user payment page feature launched in mid-2014, also citing the growth of its mobile app as an alternative.

42399668,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyP1S,1489594231,'Gemcoin' Ponzi Scheme Operator Hit With $74 Million Judgment,"One of the leaders of a Ponzi scheme that involved a fictitious cryptocurrency has been ordered to pay $74m in fines.  The judgment comes more than a year and a half after the SEC raided the offices of a company called US Fine Investment Arts Inc (USFIA), said to be connected to the scheme. Gemcoin was alleged to be tied to amber mine holdings owned by USFIA, effectively acting as a value-add to precious stones customers believed they would receive.  Yet, the SEC went on to argue in court that the venture was largely fraudulent, and that CEO Steven Chen had diverted most funds to unrelated shell companies. These shell companies are believed to hold most of the ill-gotten gains and are listed as co-defendants by the SEC.  According to a judgment handed down on Monday, Chen and a cluster of related entities – including two real estate trusts, a consulting business and a golf course holding company – were ordered to pay $51.9m in disgorged profits. The court also left Chen on the hook for $3.8m in prejudgment interest, as well as a civil penalty worth $16.7m.  Whether the SEC's successful case against Chen and USFIA represents the last of the Gemcoin story, however, remains to be seen.  Among the details put forward in past court filings, including a $100m class-action lawsuit, was the allegation that persons tied to the Gemcoin scheme had shifted their resources elsewhere, suggesting that recovery efforts for affected investors could stretch on for some time.  Past reports also indicate that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been investigating Gemcoin, though it's not immediately clear if the agency has any grounds to file any charges.

42399664,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNog,1489582841,'Super UASF': Could a Clever Idea Break Bitcoin's Scaling Deadlock?,"An experimental idea for pushing through a controversial bitcoin code change took another step forward this week.  The situation goes like this: with a scaling proposal favored by bitcoin's core developers stuck in limbo (miners have so far been reluctant to signal support for SegWit), some have sought for more drastic ways to push its changes through to the network.  That's where an upgrade process called a 'user-activated soft fork' (UASF) is supposed to come in.  First put forth on bitcoin's technical mailing list a couple of weeks ago by the pseudonymous 'shaolinfry', the proposal outlines a new way of making upgrades to bitcoin.  The idea is complex, but the gist is that, instead of miners determining whether the change goes through, the economic players (consisting of users, exchanges, wallets and payment processors) do so instead.  It quickly sparked a discussion extending to social media about the safety of such a move. Though a new, and controversial, idea, it's grabbed the attention of many bitcoin developers, including JoinMarket developer Chris Belcher and David Vorick, co-founder of decentralized storage platform Sia.  Then, this Sunday, shaolinfry, seemingly in a hurry to give his idea a spin, posted a second proposal.  This one puts forth a SegWit-specific UASF that fits with the requirements of the current deployment. This means that, if implemented, it could trigger the new type of soft fork as soon as October.  Shaolinfry told CoinDesk:  “Under that circumstance, if Segwit isn't activated by 1st October then miners will be required to do so. If they don't, the exchanges would reject blocks from those non-signaling miners, and the miners wouldn't get paid.”  Belcher noted that developers are now calling it the ""super-UASF"".  The proposal  Backing up for a second, bitcoin needs a way to upgrade its rules if it wants to add new features like SegWit. But, upgrading is complicated for software that’s worth about $20bn, and worries of how to do it safely – like, without splitting the blockchain in two – abound.  A soft fork with support from miners is arguably the safest way to do so, since it's backwards-compatible and not everyone needs to update.  However, shaolinfry sees a UASF as a necessary option right now.  ""There has been a very dangerous myth circulating in some circles that miners can decide on the consensus rules,"" shaolinfry said, adding that the bitcoin white paper describes miners' role as limited to ordering valid transactions into blocks.  Vorick, in turn, argued that SegWit is an optional upgrade, one that no one has to use, and has benefits for the ecosystem.  He told CoinDesk:  ”UASF is now becoming a popular idea because the miners are rejecting something that appears to have substantial community support.""  However, not convinced the method needs to be tried right away, Vorick stepped in on the mailing list to argue that a better way to implement the 'super-UASF' would be to first get written agreement from major economic players.  When shaolinfry was asked whether it might be too soon to roll it out, the pseudonymous programmer said:  ”I personally don’t believe so, because this is not a new deployment. This BIP only needs buy-in from the exchanges, enough to hashpower into signalling, or choosing to mine something else profitable with SHA256 asics. It will take the upgraded nodes along.”  On the mailing list, shaolinfry further argued that a majority of nodes are upgraded to bitcoin software that uses SegWit. Many companies have further upgraded their software to support the change, and several Lightning Network implementations, which are dependent on it, have cropped up, offering ""significant social proof"" that the ecosystem supports it, the programmer said.  Besides, the developer reasoned, a UASF was previously used to deploy other upgrades without any problems.  Hitting skepticism  However, many disagree that a UASF is a good idea, with discussions raising a number of questions: How does one actually measure that economic majority? Is it really safe? What happens if the miners don't follow along?  And some think it’s just too risky right now.  PhD student Phil Daian, who works on cryptocurrency projects for Cornell’s IC3, called it the “worst of both worlds” in a detailed blog post analyzing different types of forks. His concern, which he pointed out is shared by Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr, is that, ironically, it puts too much trust in miners.  ""If a single malicious block is mined, then you essentially have a chain split. And, if a majority of hash power is not enforcing the new fork, then it could be a permanent chain split where you essentially have a hard fork with the bulk hash power that’s not validating the soft fork rule. And then you have the hash power that is,” he told CoinDesk, adding:  “You’re relying a lot on miner honesty and good faith.""  The counterargument is that miners would have no choice but to support the chain that the economic majority wants, at least if they want to be able to continue to sell the bitcoins that they win from mining.  Vorick said more time is needed. ""USAF needs more study and consideration before we can be certain. I think it's likely that we attempt a UASF if the SegWit upgrade fails,” he said.  All that said, he’s optimistic, even if SegWit never goes through at all.  ""Bitcoin never upgrading again would be a disappointing result,"" Vorick said. ""But I also don't think that its spot as top dog in the cryptocurrency space would be threatened by that setback.""  He concluded:  ""Bitcoin has captured many properties that no other cryptocurrency has.""

42399667,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNqe,1489577679,Blockchain-Powered VR World Enters New Testing Phase,"A plan to build a virtual reality underpinned by a blockchain is moving ahead with the launch of a new test network.  Called Decentraland, the project launched its test blockchain yesterday, starting a new phase of development it has dubbed 'Bronze Age'. Among the developers supporting the open-source project is Manuel Aráoz, famed for bitcoin's Proof of Existence document ownership tool.  It's that kind of concept – using blockchain data to prove ownership of something at a particular point in time – that is applied in Decentraland, which uses its own blockchain network.  Essentially, its blockchain acts as a registry of land, with each new transaction block signifying a new plot. If a player mines that block, they get ownership of the land allotment, which can be later traded away to other players.  The same idea has underpinned other gaming-focused projects, including Huntercoin and BitQuest.  Aráoz said the testnet release gives prospective players the ability to start shaping their environment, adding that other functionality will continue to be added for users of the virtual world.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The current version we're releasing ... allows users to build structures using simple primitives such as cubes, spheres and plains, but we're planning to allow more complex stuff and even scripting. It's ultimately up to the users what cool stuff is built on Decentraland.""

42399665,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNnh,1489575600,Space & Time: How BitTorrent's Creator is Attacking Bitcoin Waste,"While it provides essential security for the bitcoin network, there is little doubt that using 'proof of work' as a validation mechanism requires an enormous amount of energy.  Where once blocks could be mined by amateurs with laptops, the mining process now involves warehouses full of specialized processors that are more or less useless for any purpose other than mining bitcoin.  Even ignoring questions of waste, power-intensive mining has inarguably also led to geographic concentrations of the industry. Because miners receive the greatest returns where energy is cheaper, areas like Iceland, western China and Washington State have become the dominant epicenters.  The search for a system that would encourage the opposite of these qualities – generic equipment, non-wasteful work and low power consumption – is what led developer Bram Cohen to propose the verification of computer storage ownership as an alternative to proof of work.  His so-called 'proof of space' is relatively new in the cryptocurrency world, but Cohen (who's best known for creating the BitTorrent protocol) has a well-earned reputation in the field of distributed systems, and, as a result, the community has already taken interest in the proposal.  In conversation, Cohen elaborated on the idea, arguing that the proposal is a natural iteration of the ideas powering bitcoin today.  Cohen told CoinDesk:  ""There are lots of things not to like about proof of work in bitcoin. But in the question of 'How can we change this?', it turns out the key thing is power.""  Space vs power  Under the present system, computing vast numbers of hashes leads to a race to find the cheapest power supply and use it as efficiently as possible.  According to Cohen, any alternative to this system would need to be based on a proof of something less power-demanding.  ""The only other resource to use for that is storage. So, that results in the theoretical possibility of proofs of space, where you allocate storage capacity to do this stuff,"" Cohen said.  Under a proof-of-space system, miners allocate a certain amount of their unused disk space to the network, with the probability of successfully mining a block being proportional to the amount of space allocated divided by the total capacity of the network.  To be fair, this idea didn't originate with Cohen. In fact, a white paper by another research team explains how a cryptocurrency based on proof of space, dubbed SpaceMint, would work in practice.  To briefly summarize, miners add new transactions into a block by combining them with values from a lookup of data stored in a space they have allocated for mining (the location of which is dictated by a random challenge). A large enough sample range is then used to prove the total size of storage.  One notable consequence of using storage as a proof, is that it could democratize the mining process.  Cohen explained:  ""Storage is different to power or processing in that it's very easy to have lots of additional capacity lying around. Someone who bought a hard drive for an unrelated reason and happens to have storage to spare will be willing to get extremely low returns on it, because it's not costing them anything extra to mine with it.""  This means that the network as a whole can be viable, while rewarding miners at well below the market price of their hard drive space. Another upshot of proof of space is that there is no incentive for any actors to try and gain mining share by spending large sums on storage space up front.  Time factor  Additionally, the addition of a time element guards against potential vulnerabilities that occur when, as with the SpaceMint proposal, proof of space is the only requirement for mining.  ""There's a problem if you just have proofs of space: you made it so that it doesn't cost anything to do mining,"" Cohen said, adding  ""This creates an inherent attack where someone with a large amount of resources can re-mine since genesis – go back to the beginning and make a whole new chain, giving themselves all the rewards.""  In order to prevent this, Cohen's idea is to use proof of time in combination with proof of space, specifically, proofs derived from a dedicated time server on which some time will elapse in between each period of mining.  While not eliminating the ability to re-mine blocks since genesis, this would mean that there is no way for an attacker to catch up to the current chain – a provision that he believes has been left out of other proof-of-space proposals.  At the moment, Cohen is cagey about whether he will put his own proposals into practice, but said that, in principle, alternative cryptocurrencies should be launched only if they bring something new to the table.  He said:  ""For the most part there shouldn't be the need [to launch new coins], but I have this idea about underlying mining and how it works that does make it inherently different.""  For now, though, Cohen would not say anything more. While it's tempting to read that as a tacit admission that something is in the works, only time – and space – will tell.

42399653,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNdr,1489568434,Polish Law Enforcement Investigating Bitcoin Exchange Shutdown,"Prosecutors in Łódź, Poland, have launched an investigation into the shutdown of Bitcurex, one the country's oldest and largest bitcoin exchanges.  Earlier this year, the platform suddenly went offline, reportedly depriving its users of access to some 2,300 bitcoins. In October 2016, the bitcoin exchange told local media that its IT system was ""damaged by an external interference"" that resulted with the loss of a portion of its total assets.  But while platform's operator said that it had notified the authorities of a potential crime, as of earlier this month, the website has no content.  The Prosecutor's Office said in a statement that it is investigating the case on suspicion of crimes against the property of third persons.  ""Injured persons who have not submitted a notice of offense can submit such notices directly to the Prosecutor’s Office in Łódź,"" the statement said. ""Written notices should, if possible, be accompanied by copies of the available documents or print-outs that confirm the amount of the incurred losses.""  The cryptocurrency exchange was set up in July 2012 and operated by a Łódź-based company called Digital Future. In past years, Bitcurex had been victim of various hacking attempts that forced the platform to temporarily halt its activities.  In March 2014, following an earlier hacking attack on the exchange, company representatives told CoinDesk that shutting down the site would allow Bitcurex's IT team to ""perform a necessary verification"".  Four days after that attack, the platform resumed services.
