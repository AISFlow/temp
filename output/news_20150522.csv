42378190,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdXj,1432335977,Bitcoin in the Headlines:  Nathaniel Popper Strikes Media Gold,"Conversation about bitcoin and the blockchain was seemingly everywhere this week, though a closer look at the bylines reveals this was mostly the work of one journalist – New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper.  CoinDesk, Fast Company, Forbes, TechCrunch and Vicewere just some of the publications this week that either ran interviews with Popper or exclusive excerpts of his new book, Digital Gold, the product of six months of research on the technology.  Popper's excerpts generated headlines and social media buzz for their revelations regarding industry activity, with portions devoted to reexamining some of the community's most mainstream stories and subjects.  However, the New York Times wasn't the only media outlet focusing on bitcoin this week, with Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal devoting their share of articles to the emerging technology.  Nathaniel Popper's bitcoin tour  Leading the charge was perhaps Popper's most provocative story, his account of his personal search for Satoshi Nakamoto, the still-anonymous author of the bitcoin white paper and its assumed creator. The trial, as we explored last week, led him to cryptographer Nick Szabo.  The report was widely covered into last weekend, though most articles aimed for clicks in ways that suggested the author had broken new ground on the Nakamoto mystery. More sensational headlines included ""Did the New York Times Find Satoshi?"" and ""The New York Times Thinks It's Identified Mysterious Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto"", though these were only a few of many.  Just as interesting, however, were new revelations provided in detailed narratives on the untimely demise of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox that added new perspective to the situation surrounding its February 2014 insolvency.  New information was also provided on 21 Inc, the startup that until last week's CoinDesk report was bitcoin's best-kept secret. In his account, Popper explained how 21's mining operations effectively allowed Silicon Valley's elite ""to invest without needing to come out as public supporters of bitcoin"". Popper shed further light on the company's funding rounds, indicating it has paid back most of its original investors.  Additional reports illustrated Wells Fargo's early interest in bitcoin as well as the early days of BitInstant, one of the first major venture backed companies in the bitcoin space.  Bloomberg's deep dive  Boasting contributions from bitcoin industry luminaries such as Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert and Coin Center director Jerry Brito was a Bloomberg special report on bitcoin, a deep dive into topics such as global regulation, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and the viability of bitcoin's mining sector.  BitGo CEO Mike Belshe, Boston University professor Mark T Williams and Wedbush Securities managing director Gil Luria were among the industry participants featured in Q&A segments of the report.  Among the most interesting observations, though, were the report's attempts to tie bitcoin to the rise of mobile banking. Cited therein were figures that suggest 23% of merchant acquirers and independent sales organisations surveyed have plans to ""start accepting bitcoin within the next two years"", a development Bloomberg suggested would spur wider merchant adoption.  The conclusion notably clashes with findings from CoinDesk's Q1 State of Bitcoin report, which found that merchant adoption growth is on the decline.  Elsewhere, Bloomberg tried to connect bitcoin swaps trading with its price volatility and took aim at itBit's assertion that its New York banking charter would allow it to serve customers in all 50 US states, claims it continues to evoke in the media.  Paul Hastings LLP partner Chris Daniel told the report:  “While itBit may have engaged in this exercise already, it will require a state-by-state approach to determine whether other states agree that a trust company is the right regulated structure to engage in commercial cryptocurrency exchange activity in their state.""  Sponsored by SolidX and Xapo and featuring ads from Blockchain, Nadex and the Bitcoin Investment Trust, the report was just as much a showcase of the range of bitcoin companies seeking to reach Bloomberg's influential audience.  WSJ's bitcoin pizza party  This week also brought signs that bitcoin continues to hold a place in the larger pop culture consciousness in the US.  Several notable news outlets (including CoinDesk) issued tributes to bitcoin's homegrown holiday, Bitcoin Pizza Day. Held on 22nd May, the celebration commemorates the first purchase of a physical good with bitcoin by developer Laszlo Hanyecz.  Somewhat surprisingly, The Wall Street Journal was the most vocal on the subject, running two separate (albeit somewhat overlapping) reports on Bitcoin Pizza Day both in its BitBeat column and in a separate video.  Still, WSJ reporter Paul Vigna used the lighthearted event as a way to express the larger narratives around bitcoin.  In the video, this was highlighted through explanations of how the event helped prove the digital currency could be used in finance, while in print he noted that influential representatives from Wall Street are now taking bitcoin seriously, silly holidays and all.  Vigna wrote:  ""The growing opinion on Wall Street — and this is just what we’re gleaning from the people we talk to — is that this technology is not simply an online scam, even if it’s not exactly the epoch-shaking disruptive force its most fervent adherents want it to be. Its future will somewhere between those two extremes.""  Nathaniel Popper is scheduled to appear at Consensus 2015, CoinDesk's flagship conference to be held 10th September.

42378172,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdEr,1432325637,Bitcoin Regulation Remains on Agenda for California Agency,"The California Department of Business Oversight (DBO) released conflicting statements today regarding how bitcoin regulation will move forward in the most populous US state.  In statements to Bloomberg, the DBO stated that it had elected not to exercise its authority to regulate bitcoin and digital currencies, instead passing this determination to the state legislature.  DBO spokesperson Tom Dresslar explained his department's decision in conversation with Bloomberg, first stating that he believed that the legislature would be best suited to draft a regulatory regime in the best interest of consumers and businesses.  However, such statements were recanted within hours.  Dresslar told CoinDesk:  ""We haven't made a decision. We're still in the process of how or if at all to regulate virtual currency business under our current statutory scheme. ""  Dresslar offered no additional comment on the day's events.  The update is the first since the DBO's December announcement that a meeting would be held to address the topic.  As of January  , the meeting had been delayed, prompting uncertainty as to when or if the bank and money transmitter regulator would come to a formal decision.

42378176,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdHN,1432312827,Investment Funds Containing Bitcoin Added to IG,"The first fund to offer bitcoin investment as part of a bespoke portfolio has launched on global derivatives trading platform IG, the UK's largest forex provider.  Launched in late 2014, funding platform Invest Your Way (IYW) will enable traders to invest in bitcoin via contract for differences (CFDs), a form of futures contract where trades are settled in cash as opposed to physical goods.  In this case, the CFD will mimic bitcoin – the underlying asset – providing returns based on the digital currency's price.  IYW CEO Michael Newell told CoinDesk:  ""We actively work with clients to expand this range and the most highly requested product since launch has been bitcoin. Many people are aware of what they are, yet few know how to access them [bitcoin]. Fewer still would have any idea how to build bitcoin into a diversified portfolio.""  He continued: ""In response to this demand we have worked to bring a solution to market that allows for exposure to bitcoin as part of a balanced and managed portfolio. ""  Risk management  According to Newell, client funds are stored in a fully segregated UK bank account and IG, the broker, sources bitcoin from a variety of providers to offset risk.  ""IG manages its risk appropriately with bitcoin as they do with every other asset class, and runs its platform with its own set of due diligence and risk criteria,"" said the CEO.  He continued:  ""Bitcoin is still a relatively new product and the value of them can be quite volatile. To ensure that this risk is managed appropriately, InvestYourWay will only include Bitcoin as one holding within a diversified fund, thereby reducing exposure and managing risk. ""  IYW will only offer the bitcoin option to those clients who are able to demonstrate sufficient investment experience.  A spokesperson for IG confirmed the partnership, stating that it provided the underlying infrastructure which enabled it to format the investment product and ""securely hold their client money in segregated accounts in line with FCA regulatory requirements"".

42378174,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdCL,1432300105,Bitfinex Warns Customers to Halt Deposits After Suspected Hack,"UPDATE (22nd May, 17:2opm GMT): A representative from Bitfinex has indicated it has generated a new hot wallet on a ""failsafe machine"". It expects deposits and withdrawals will be live ""soon"", after the wallet has successfully synced.      Popular bitcoin exchange Bitfinex today urged customers to halt deposits while it investigates a suspected hack.  In a statementhttps://www.bitfinex.com/pages/announcements/?id=35 released this morning, the Hong Kong-based company said the keys to its hot wallet ""might have been compromised"". However, the majority of customers' funds would not be affected, it said.  ""Although we keep over 99.5% of users' BTC deposits in secure multisig wallets, the small remaining amount in coins in our hot wallet are theoretically vulnerable to attack [...] Although this incident is unfortunate, its scale is small and will be fully absorbed by the company.""  This year saw both Coinapult and Bitstamp lose funds in hot wallet thefts, with an estimated total loss of $5.4m at the time of reporting.  Currently the third most popular global bitcoin exchange, Bitfinex's 24-hour volumehttps://www.bitfinex.com/pages/stats stands at 15,905.02 BTC ($3.7m), according to BitcoinCharts.  A 0.5% loss on these trades works out at roughly $18,500. However, data from CryptoWatch and BitcoinWisdom suggests some variation in the exchange's global volume and its potential loss. Both list volume figures closer to 10,500 BTC.  Bitfinex  said it was working to create a new hot wallet for the deposits it stores online.  The exchange, which recently partnered with AlphaPoint to overhaul its back-end, is expected to release further updates in the coming hours.  Additional reporting by Pete Rizzo.

42378191,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdYz,1432294022,Payment Processor Unveils Bitcoin Startup at Plug and Play Expo,"Plug and Play Tech Center celebrated its inaugural batch of FinTech startups, including a new bitcoin exchange from payment processor Netopia, at an event in the heart of Silicon Valley yesterday.  ""The big doomsday we're seeing now is death by a thousand cuts,"" said Plug and Play FinTech director Scott Robinson as he opened the afternoon session of the FinTech & Retail Expo at its Sunnyvale location.  His introduction made clear his belief that the financial industry is, due to unavoidable factors, on a collision course with technological innovation. This includes, most importantly, the millennial generation's desire for alternative financial products.  The director went on to forecast a future in which a new generation of startups will chip away at traditional financial revenue streams slowly, but surely.  Robinson stated that he sees Silicon Valley taking the lead on this transition:  ""You can teach engineers finance, but you can't teach the finance industry technology.""  The role bitcoin and blockchain technologies will play in this larger narrative featured in five of the day's 24 presentations.  Perhaps most notable of these was the surprise announcement by Romanian payment processor Netopia mobilPay that it intends to launch a sister bitcoin exchange, BTKO.in.  Netopia is well established as an online payment processor, serving more than 6,000 retailers and processing more than 800,000 transactions in Q1 2014.  Elsewhere, authentication, security, analytics, the cloud and big data were technologies up for discussion. Bluink Ltd took the top prize in the FinTech category for Injector, an app that uses bluetooth and speech to replace passwords.  While no bitcoin-first startups prevailed, Retail category winner Pinn nodded to the digital currency's future in the mainstream retail experience.  ""You can either link your bank account using your online banking credentials or you can use your bitcoin wallet,"" CEO Will Summerlin told CoinDesk, adding that he expects bitcoin usage to rise in the coming years.  Elsewhere, startups seeking to build the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem held their own onstage with compelling ideas that illustrated why they were selected from over 800 applicants.  BTKO.in  ""We are not a startup. We are the biggest payment gateway in Romania.""  With these bold words, Netopia mobilPay CEO Antonio Eram introduced BTKO.io, a Romania-based bitcoin exchange platform that was the only startup to present not listed on the official schedule.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Eram clarified that BTKO.in is a spin-off from Netopia that will be supported by its sister company through shared development and management resources – a relationship not always clear in the presentation.  ""We keep it separately since we have investors interested exclusively in this project,"" Eram explained.  Though unexpected, the announcement follows Netopia's decision to integrate bitcoin payments in December. Netopia previously entered into a partnership with defunct bitcoin exchange BTCXchange, which went offline in late 2014 following security issues.  BTKO.in is not yet online, but Eram told CoinDesk he has big plans for the project, adding:  ""We want to build an entire bitcoin ecosystem in eastern Europe.""  37coins  The first bitcoin startup of the day was beta-only SMS bitcoin wallet provider 37coins.  COO Jonathan Zobro explained how the startup aims to use low-cost cell phone technology to make mobile money international and carrier-independent for consumers in the developing world.  ""Onboarding is as simple as knowing your friend's phone number,"" he explained.  Zobro went on to state that he sees 37coins as a company focused on onboarding the 2.5 billion underbanked consumers worldwide.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Zobro said the startup will now focus on adding multisig and HD wallet security to its platform.  ""We have to make the best security compromises ... we've made the conscious decision to split up the keys and make the most secure version that we can,"" he added.  Gazebo  Formerly known as Pavilion when it launched at the fall 2014 DEMO conference, blockchain startup Gazebo is now setting its sights on the global trade finance market.  ""Exports and importers have been moving away from debt and paper. Bank revenues in trade finance have been declining for the first time in a while,"" founder and CEO Jamie Young said, rifling through facts and figures on inadequacies in this market.  Gazebo is seeking to use the blockchain's open ledger system to create products for treasury and trade solutions (TTS) and global transaction services (GTS) specialists who need to transport and manage supply chains of physical goods  Using the blockchain and escrow services, Gazebo aims to manage the movement of fiat dollars on behalf of clients, validating shipments and releasing funds to the relevant parties.  The demonstration represented an evolution of the product from its November iteration, which focused on offering escrow services to larger e-commerce companies such as eBay, Amazon and Alibaba.  BitWage  Yet another startup focused on how bitcoin and the blockchain could permeate international money transfer was payroll startup BitWage.  Launched in late 2014, BitWage offers employees the ability to be paid in bitcoin without the need for employers to integrate the service.  Often billed as a solution for diehard bitcoin users, BitWage COO Jonathan Chester's presentation demonstrated that he's willing to think big about how the startup could solve real problems for those outside the current community.  ""Uber is paying contractors in 58 countries worldwide. They build banking relationships in all those countries and deal with those regulations. The cost is high and the time to market is slow,"" he said.  Employees and contractors, Chester continued, have to deal with high foreign exchange costs and large transfer times, creating more pain and friction in this system.  Still, Chester was able to go beyond identifying problems, showcasing that BitWage has a specific blueprint for how its solution can fit into this larger puzzle.  The next stage for BitWage, his presentation inferred, will be seeking out large multinational companies that could cut costs by offering the technology.  ChangeTip  One of the more tenured startups in the program, having raised $3.5m in venture capital, ChangeTip CEO Nick Sullivan gave an entertaining if uninspired overview of how the company enables micropayments, what he called the ""first real interesting use case for bitcoin"".  ""We call it a 'love button' for the Internet,"" he said. ""There's a fairly established 'like' economy. We call this a love button because this is for content that you love.""  The CEO went on to showcase how ChangeTip users can use its platform to send small amounts of money over popular social networks and content platforms.  ""What if you could have donated 10 cents by favoriting or liking posts for the Ice Bucket Challenge?"" he asked.  He also charted a course for how micropayments could evolve beyond their current niche audience to become more widespread, even if it was perhaps unclear to the audience the role ChangeTip could play in this transition.  Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Jonathan Chester was CEO of BitWage. He is acting COO at the bitcoin payroll startup.

42378180,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdMP,1432275708,BitcoinTalk Server Compromised During Social Engineering Attack,"Popular digital currency forum BitcoinTalk has been taken offline following a social engineering attack that resulted in a server compromise.  The attack is said to have targeted the site's ISP, a company called NFOrce that is based in the Netherlands. During a social engineering attack, an attacker tries to manipulate the target with the goal of convincing them to divulge passwords or other sensitive information.  The compromise was announced via the official BitcoinTalk Twitter account. Operator Theymos later took to the bitcoin subreddit to offer a more detailed explanation, writing:  ""The forum's ISP NFOrce managed to get tricked into giving an attacker access to the server. I think that the attacker had access for only about 12 minutes before I noticed it and had the server disconnected, so he probably wasn't able to get a complete dump of the database.""  Theymos said that BitcoinTalk could remain offline for as many as 60 hours following the incident, and cautioned users to ""act as though your password hashes, PMs, emails, etc. were compromised"".  Future updates about the situation will be posted to the Twitter account, according to Theymos, and a full report will be published once the forum is back online.  NFOrce and Theymos did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
