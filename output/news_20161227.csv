42379120,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mz9z,1482870698,"Trusted Hardware Can Help Bitcoin Scale, But At What Cost?","As 2016 comes to a close, bitcoin development remains at a crossroads.  Take the long-anticipated scaling solution, the Lightning Network. An open-source project that aims to boost bitcoin's capacity to millions of transactions per second (and by extension the technology's value), it's code is nearly ready to go live. Yet, bitcoin isn't exactly ready for the change.  While some form of the Lightning Network is possible to deploy today, the technical change that could pave the way for an improved version still needs near-unanimous support from miners and users or it won’t activate. (For now, miner hashrate signaling has plateaued at about 25%, far from the necessary 95%).  This bottleneck has lead some researchers to begin exploring other options for getting Lightning-style payment channels off the ground.  One new idea, Teechan, comes from Initiative For CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3), an academic group focused on blockchain and led by Cornell University. The announcement post explains that the off-chain transaction protocol is similar to Lightning Network, potentially allowing millions of transactions per second – but it uses a different construction.  Namely, it relies on a special type of hardware, Intel SGX, that masks data and guards it from outside tinkering.  The upside is that it works right now, and that it takes advantage of the relative ubiquity of Intel's chips.  Ittay Eyal, one of the computer scientists behind Teechan, told CoinDesk:  ""Teechan is essentially working on the existing bitcoin network, without change. We ran a channel on the bitcoin testnet only with features available on the operational network.""  One thing to keep in mind, however, is that participants would need to buy a specific type of computer with a specific hardware to open up a channel. (Intel SGX only works on a subset of the company's products).  While bitcoin's developers say they aren't opposed to the idea of trusted hardware in all blockchain networks, the idea it could be applied to a global, trustless network in some capacity has some up in arms.  Decentralization debate  At issue for many is that trusted hardware is at odds with bitcoin's decentralized security model as it has been popularly conceived. By nature, it requires some degree of trust in the tech giant Intel.  The use of trusted hardware in cryptocurrency projects (that are largely software driven) has drawn skepticism before for that reason.  Although trusted execution environments are one way to ensure the privacy and security of data, Intel (or another hardware provider) potentially has a backdoor to the content.  ""That’s certainly true,"" said Cornell Tech computer science professor Ari Juels, though he argued that it’s ""hard to escape"" centralization in all forms. Trust in Intel is particularly hard to avoid, he said, since their chips power so many devices, even the nodes and wallets that bitcoiners already rely on.  According to data from 2015, nearly 90% of all computers run on Intel chips.  There seems to be some interest in the idea from other open-source blockchain communities as well.  Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, for instance, posted a Twitter poll last week asking his followers how they feel about the trend towards using trusted hardware as an ""ingredient"" in blockchain projects, which received a mixed response.  The answer might not be so clear, according to cryptographer Matthew Green.  ""It depends what's at stake. The security of a global network and billions of dollars? No way,"" he commented, reiterating how he believes Intel poses a single point of failure.  Here Green might be referencing proof-of-elapsed-time (PoET), a consensus algorithm developed by Intel that uses the same Intel hardware.  Other use cases  With that in mind, IC3 has been looking into trusted computing use cases beyond micropayment channels. (Intel was even recently added as a sponsor of the academic blockchain group).  Further, of 13 blockchain projects listed on the IC3 website, at least three use trusted computing to some degree as a way to ensure data integrity or privacy.  One reason is that the smart contracts that would run on top of a blockchain are increasingly being thought of as tools for data verification, say, if the temperature on a certain date and time would be necessary for its execution.  ""Pretty much any interesting smart contract needs to have some awareness of real-world state. Any financial instrument needs to have an idea of what’s going on in the real world, whether equity prices, commodity prices,"" Juels said.  But, while it might sound like an easy task, retrieving trustworthy data for smart contracts is what Juels called it a ""pretty major stumbling block,"" because data can be manipulated before it reaches the smart contract.  He argued that current oracles on ethereum don't provide high trust assurance. On the other hand, the project Town Crier uses SGX to scrape data from a website that the participants deem trustworthy with the assurance that it won’t be tampered with in its journey to the smart contract.  The Town Crier white paper is public, and IC3 plans to release a public version on ethereum in early 2017.  Hawk  is another ethereum project that uses the privacy technology behind Zcash to hide the sending and receiving addresses of ethereum transactions. Programmers can write smart contracts as they normally would, then, run it through the Hawk compiler to mask its contents.  By playing the role of “manager” in some Hawk applications, Intel SGX can help to execute Hawk smart contracts that sees a user’s inputs, but is trusted to keep them secret from other programs.  Future uses  And this may be just the beginning.  Juels thinks there are many future applications of trusted hardware that have yet to be tapped and many more experiments for developers to attempt.  As an example, he cited how bug bounties now offer rewards to coders, benefiting open-source projects (such as ethereum) as well as coders who have the ability to spot errors. But, Juels mentioned that fair exchange is often an issue. Coders don't always get paid what they're promised after revealing the bug that they found, while others might get a pay out for finding a bug that isn't real or useful.  He offered the idea of a bug bounty smart contract. Using the strong integrity guarantees of SGX, bounty hunters can prove that they discovered a bug without revealing it to the company.  In the future, IC3 is also looking into improving concepts that are already out there, and continue the development of protocols that use trusted hardware.  While the jury may still be out on the technology, it's safe to say it could become a big trend in the year ahead as major blockchains compete to boost capacity.

42379116,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mz6D,1482847809,I Want the Truth: Could Blockchain Stop Online News Distortion?,"""The shitpost is mightier than the thinkpiece.""  That's a quote a friend says he saw in the news once, though I can't find it. He swears he didn't make it up. But it's not out there on the Internet it seems, and if it is, it's lost in the millions of tweets, texts and tumblrs.  That's the way the truth is these days, lost in the pages upon pages upon pages...  It's concerning, this degradation of truth that has come as content has migrated from newsprint to digital platforms. Just because something seems (or sounds) true doesn't mean it is. Like the quote, fact-based content seems to be getting harder to find, and increasingly based on belief.  When 62% of American adults access news via social media, and the top-20 fake news stories outperform the top 20 legitimate stories, there’s reason to worry.  It may not be a surprise then that Facebook and Google are now facing mounting criticism for fake news that appears on their platforms. (Google now says it will ban fake news websites from using its advertising service, and Facebook updated its policy language saying that it will not display ads in sites running fake news).  But, it might be time to face a reality – the issue may be with the nature of the platforms that carry the news and the profit systems they work under, not the information itself.  Now, blockchain companies are trying to shake up content creation, and these projects interest someone like me – a journalist that's worried about the state of the profession in the digital age.  The emergence of new social media and content platforms coincides with a growing disillusionment with systems that control user data and push exploitive content. And it's not just a complaint from the media pen, but a threat to knowledge in the US and around the world.  Is the same consideration for the truth being demanded today of the legacy social media giants being put into these new blockchain-based content platforms?  UX over truth  The short answer is the issue doesn't seem to be top of mind.  According to Ryan X Charles, founder of Yours (a micropayments system built on top of a social media platform), its mission is about ""getting content creators paid on the Internet"".  That's all fine and well if those content creators are posting well-written, factually-correct content. But if they're not, are we not recreating the same problems? Why should I, or anyone else, pay them?  ""I wouldn’t say we're focused first and foremost on truth,"" Charles said.  He's working under the principles of market economics, allowing users to pick the rules like Reddit moderators (Charles is a former cryptocurrency engineer at the social media company).  ""Some communities on the platform will not be very good,"" he said. ""But the ones that pick the right rules with the right amounts of money to the right people will succeed over others.""  That doesn’t seem to be the case as highlighted above in media.  Sure, the idea is that social media users who create good content should get paid for their posts, but there are already mechanisms for this. Nearly naked women have had success selling photos on premium SnapChat accounts using SnapCash, while highly trafficked Twitter accounts partner with affiliate networks to share ad revenue.  Power dynamics  But Yours isn’t the only blockchain platform that seems to be trying to democratize money-making on social media.  On Steemit  , a blockchain social media platform that has been criticized for its construction, blockchain entrepreneurs are making $1,500 in digital currency for writing short posts that probably took them no longer than 15 minutes.  In comparison to the measly amount journalists get paid for researching topics (including the blockchain) for weeks, months, if not years, this system seems to incentivize quick, unsophisticated content over investigative reporting.  Steemit also suffers from a sustainability problem that's been much-discussed.  For example, several cryptocurrency enthusiasts believe Steemit's executive team holds a majority of the platform's tokens even today, and it uses the big payouts as a kind of marketing incentive to get more people onto the platform. And the more people that sign up, the higher the price per token goes, making the executives richer, especially since most users will cash out as soon as they can, selling the tokens on an exchange to most likely the same executives that tipped them in the first place.  For all this, the company’s mission aligns more closely with the interests of journalists. In May, CEO and founder Ned Scott said the Reddit-like platform looks to ""reward positivity and accuracy over garbage content like some of the things you see on Facebook"".  But then, the disproportionate power gets in the way.  ""If you don't please the whales you won't get ahead,"" said Charles from Yours. This is why Yours isn't creating a new currency for its platform, to mitigate power grabs and ponzi-scheme skepticism, he said.  But Yours and other platforms like it might suffer the same by targeting cryptocurrency enthusiasts first. The cryptocurrency industry is filled with vehement supporters who have at times shuttered any type of criticism.  On Reddit, r/bitcoin has been heavily censored during the block size debate and just perusing through the comments on CoinDesk that don’t align with the hype provides a good example of echo chamber onslaughts.  There, content about the need for regulation for projects holding people’s money might get downvoted into oblivion. These echo chambers almost disincentivize critical thought, although they make significant amounts of money for people that play along.  Identity is key  But two veteran journalists, Anthony Duignan-Cabrera and Jeff Koyen (who have both signed up for Yours) think blockchain could play a part in providing an identity layer that acts as a verifier for those posting news to social platforms. And that could be the key to saving journalism.  The problem in Koyen’s mind is that journalism plays under the rules of advertising, racking up more clicks increases your revenue. And this leads to a system rife with ad fraud through programmatic advertising and click farms.  This is where blockchain could come in, as an identity layer and transparent ledger that makes ad fraud harder to propagate undetected. Readers, either pseudonymous or not, would send a publisher a cryptocurrency token that is used to verify that they are in fact a real person.  Duignan-Cabrera agrees that this could free journalist from the clutches of advertising.  ""Everything the internet touches, it devalues,"" he said. ""Which could mean it makes it all crap but it could also mean that it just disrupts whatever previous revenue model was used.""  And in publishing, that could be a good thing.  Through the blockchain, Duignan-Cabrera thinks a vetting process could be established which allows the content creator, advertiser and consumer to build a trusted relationship. This could use the payments features of the blockchain as well, allowing a consumer to directly pay a content creator or an advertiser to distribute revenue-share micropayments to publishers immediately.  For now, it seems there’s still hope in such systems, even if they’re not mature today.  ""Decentralizing publishing is terrifying; there’s not a lot of incentive to strip away the centralized publishers because there’s still a need for trusted forums,"" he said.  But he argues that the blockchain could enhance the ability of these services to perform their duties, concluding:  ""With blockchain, there could be verification of source, trust and viewers.""

42379124,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mzGH,1482845257,'Blessing and a Curse': The DAO's Developers on Blockchain in 2016,"Christoph Jentzsch is the founder of Slock.it, the ethereum smart contracts company that this year developed The DAO, the largest-ever (and most contentious) application on the second-largest blockchain network.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Jentzsch gives his overview of the year that was, discussing how he believes his project helped advance the industry even as it came to challenge many of its core concepts.  Looking back, I have to say it was quite a ride.  As much has been said (and written) about my firm and its contributions to the blockchain industry this year, I wanted to give a short opinion piece on what happened inside our part of the ethereum world, not from a neutral, outside perspective, but from our ('biased') inside perspective.  At the beginning of this year, Slock.it was working hard on making the vision of a decentralized sharing economy come true by developing an Ethereum Smart Home Server using Ubuntu Core and Samsung Hardware.  It was an exciting time, and we made quite some progress.  That changed when it came time for us to raise money – we decided to help build a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) instead of doing a centralized token sale or using classic venture capital-based funding.  With this, the story of The DAO began. Much has been said and written about it (a detailed summary can be found here). It was an amazing journey and (I would argue) proved the large-scale interest a truly decentralized autonomous organization had on a large group of people.  It brought a lot of mainstream media attention toward the blockchain, and especially the ethereum blockchain. We all know what happened next though, it failed due to a software bug in the smart contract and started a debate about how to resolve this situation.  The ethereum community has never before had to face this kind of challenge. It was both a blessing and a curse that there was 28 days time to find a solution (after this, the option of doing a hard fork would have become unfeasible).  It not only challenged the ethereum governance system, but prompted deep questions about the nature of blockchain governance itself.  What we learned  So, what is the ethereum governance system? We're a bit closer now to understanding that.  At its core, ethereum is a protocol that brings very different people and interests group together – the Ethereum Foundation, miners, exchanges, loosely coupled groups building products on it, developers, users and pure speculators.  As per its protocol, ethereum is currently a proof-of-work blockchain, and in terms of governance, there is not much more beyond ""whatever people choose to run"". Of course, it is not as simple as that. There are only a few people who have the skills to develop a client and safely make changes to it.  Additionally, there are strong network effects. Nevertheless, the developers turned out to be very receptive to the wishes of the community – not enforcing their opinions, but instead listening carefully to the users, adding their expertise and solely offering choices.  I think the ethereum client developers have done a very good job, and I respect them a lot for the challenging work they do.  After much debate, a majority supported the hard fork by updating their clients and despite the extreme time pressure, it went very smoothly. It also added a new group that supports the old blockchain, proving that every user is free to choose the blockchain they wish to run.  Some wrongly argue that it was the centralized decision of a few elites that arbitrarily led the change to the protocol.  As someone who was in contact with many different groups during that time, and actively promoting and writing the specifications for a potential hard fork, I can tell you that I have never seen a decision process more fraught with hardship than this one.  Centralized systems are very efficient in making decisions, but this was about accurately aligning the community with all its parts – and a lot was learned from this work.  I hope we can improve the ethereum governance system, and some suggestions, such as controlling protocol parameters via a smart contract or using a stake vote to activate a hard fork and simultaneously disable the old chain are now being discussed.  Much less contentious hard forks have also been used this year to cope with denial-of-service attacks and to improve the protocol. Through all of that, ethereum has shown its resilience during the various attacks, and it may be that The DAO had a part in bringing awareness to these limitations.  Evolution continues  As we end the year, the ethereum ecosystem is getting stronger and stronger.  The strength, determination and skills of its developer community displayed at its annual developer conference Devcon2 were overwhelming to me, and I am excited to see the progress being made in terms of smart contract security, developer tools, dapp infrastructure, client development and, last but not least, ongoing research in protocol improvement.  Although ""The DAO"" has ended, the concept of the DAO is not dead, and we want to continue working on it and experimenting with it. As such, we started a new project called the Charity DAO. On this project, we want to apply the lessons learned to date and improve a domain close to our hearts: charitable giving.  Going forward, Slock.it is also continuing to work on projects that we believe will help decentralize the sharing economy, such as Share&Charge, a project that was recently noted by the German Government. Together with Innogy, we will launch this project, paving the foundations for a smooth peer-to-peer experience sharing charging stations for electric cars.  In conclusion, I remain excited about what 2017 will bring us.  We hope to bring as many physical objects on the public ethereum chain as possible to allow people to rent, sell and share them directly, and I personally expect the launch of actual products and services that will make use of the public ethereum blockchain.  With this, the lessons learned and the continuous development of dapps, I believe we will see the bits and pieces of ethereum's Web 3.0 vision coming together in 2017.

42379123,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mzF1,1482840840,4 Reasons 2017 Will Be Blockchain's Banner Year,"Peter Loop is associate vice president and principal technology architect at Infosys, a next-generation IT services provider.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Loop gives his overview of why, despite signs the hype had peaked in 2016, blockchain is poised to be more widely tested, deployed and adopted in 2017.  I can confidently say blockchain will be the most dynamic area in tech in 2017 – already, we're seeing some major players position themselves for a leap forward in the year ahead.  Global banks like Santander and Goldman Sachs, for instance, recently announced they would not renew membership in the blockchain consortium they helped found, R3CEV – an example of increased investment from significant brands in finance, retail and supply chain, to name a few, in developing blockchain technology internally.  Similar announcements are now happening regularly, building momentum for blockchain as a primary focus of tech investment and development in the year ahead.  An increasing number of industries are realizing the need for urgency in being ahead of the curve, and are exploring ways of using blockchain technology.  Here are my top four predictions for the most impactful changes blockchain will cause in 2017:  1. Deployments will come online  Despite misconceptions that blockchain is years away, we'll see full deployments in financial services, insurance and healthcare industries next year.  This will completely disrupt our payment systems on an international scale – revenue models and other processes will become obsolete, and payments will become faster, cheaper and safer.  But because blockchain is becoming mainstream, we can no longer afford to ignore the major hurdles that stand in our way. For example, banks must define a clear path to adoption for blockchain and collaborate on a global standardization.  2. Progress on standardization will be made  With blockchain becoming more widely adopted, a standardized method for interaction will be critically important. There are complicated and political processes preventing this – industry organizations have competing interests and businesses enjoy having a perceived advantage.  As blockchain implementations begin, we’ll see a paradigm shift toward standardization and consolidation as organizations which were once in competition realize the benefits of a unified approach, including accelerated trade processes, enhanced detection and better data management.  There may be only a couple of viable blockchain consortiums left standing in 2017, but industry players will have to cooperate and collectively agree on open standards that are flexible and versatile. Governments and regulators also have a key role to play, protecting consumers yet fostering innovation.  The stakeholders pushing the evolution of these standards will need to be imaginative, and envision a future where innovators leverage the standards they made to create new and powerful tools.  3. Blockchain aside, FinTech is only accelerating  FinTech is causing massive change, everything from a single payment to how global finance operates is being disrupted.  Further changes to expect in the year ahead include:  Blockchain and machine learning will combine to accelerate existing processes and optimize efficiencies  Emojis as payments will become used more widely as mobile devices become increasingly secure  Lending networks will become one of the hottest areas of blockchain  Nations around the world will become very interested in digital currency development.  4. Payments is ripe for disruption  Within the field of payment transactions, the technology could be used to overcome current problems of the correspondent banking system and international money transfers.  The fee-intensive and fragmented processes of cross-border, non-cash transactions could be eliminated by the exclusion of third parties, direct money transfers and efficient interbank settlements. The possibility to create a competitive marketplace of liquidity providers potentially ensures the best exchange rates for international exchange and payment transactions.  Payment systems are based on local laws and practices within existing domestic banking, and the lack of a common standard reduces the ability to seamlessly pass data and back-office information, creating both settlement and non-settlement risks.  A broad implementation and use of the blockchain technology would change and disrupt the financial services industry and payment systems on an international scale.  Summary  Blockchain technology has the potential to completely change processes and systems within industries. It could remove trusted third parties, decrease costs and ultimately increase profits for various players within the industry.  However, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution, as potential use cases need to fit to the technology’s specific characteristics and requirements, such as security, decentralization, and dependence on the Internet as a basis.
