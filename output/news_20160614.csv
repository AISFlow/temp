42378728,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lfyT,1465944304,Ether Hits Record Highs as Price Decouples From Bitcoin,"The price of ether, the native digital asset on the Ethereum blockchain, neared $20 for the first time ever on 14th June, approaching the milestone as it appeared to break out of its old trading patterns.  In recent weeks, market observers asserted that ether had been displaying a negative correlation with the older, more established digital currency bitcoin. However, the two currencies failed to exhibit this relationship during today’s session, as ether saw price growth that happened in spite of declines in the price of bitcoin.  Ether’s price fluctuations also notably took place amid generous trading volume, as 24-hour transaction activity reached $62.7m at one point during the day, coming close to the record daily high of $65.3m reached in March, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.  Ether surged to $18.95 during the session, reaching a new all-time high, data from leading Ethereum exchange Poloniex reveals. This daily peak, reached at 04:45 UTC, was roughly 10% higher than the session’s opening price of $17.25. Ether hit this level amid a 24-hour volume of $45.5m, according to CoinMarketCap data.  But, when ether reached its new high of $18.95, bitcoin was trading at $692.80, roughly 2% below the currency’s opening price of $705.62, figures provided by CoinDesk’s USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) reveal. Later in the session, bitcoin fell to a low of $661.60, a roughly 6% decline from the opening value.  If bitcoin and ether were displaying a negative correlation, the drop in the former should have caused a rise in the latter. However, when bitcoin hit its daily low, ether had fallen to $18.04, according to additional Poloniex figures.  As bitcoin has long been the dominant digital currency (it was the first public blockchain to operate at scale and gather a wide user base), traders continue to watch for signs ether is emerging as a viable alternative investment, one that moves based on different stresses and factors than bitcoin.  Today’s price movements should go a long way toward helping ether strike out on its own.  Charles L.

42378725,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lfpf,1465938582,Security Pioneer John McAfee Adds Blockchain Experts to Advisory Board,"Security pioneer John McAffee has added two bitcoin pioneers to his new company's advisory board as part of a broader effort to make digital currency businesses more secure.  A part of the strategy for MGT Capital Investments, McAffee yesterday launched the Cryptosecurity Advisory Board, naming bitcoin angel investor Roger Ver as board chairman. Today, MGT added serial industry entrepreneur Erik Voorhees as an inaugural member of the board.  While banks and other financial institutions have been adopting blockchain technology because of its increased transparency and efficiency, McAfee said the board, and an entirely new soon-to-be launched division at the company, are aimed at making the technology more secure.  McAfee told CoinDesk:  ""[Blockchain] is extremely insecure from a hacking standpoint, and that’s my specialty.""  McAfee said that he believes blockchain technology creates a more secure way to ""verify transactions"", but that the recent hack of cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift and the high-profile case of defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox show that businesses built on top of the technology are still vulnerable to attacks.  ""I’m horrified when I see people on their smartphones with their wallet. In 10 minutes if you give me their cell phone, I could have all their money,"" McAfee said.  McAfee was appointed as chairman and CEO of MGT Capital in May, causing a brief 1,000% surge in the publicly traded company’s stocks. Formerly a fantasy sports enterprise, the firm is in the process of being rebranded as John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc following McAfee's addition to the team.  Today, the company's stock is trading at $2.63 a share, valuing the company at $59m.  Rebuilding a new company  Given McAfee's history with new technologies, the move has already sparked speculation in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.  McAfee is perhaps best known as the founder of McAfee Associates in 1987, a company would come to be synonymous with online security. In 2010, Intel purchased the firm for $7.6bn.  But, as for how the new advisory board will assist in MGT's positioning in the blockchain space, members were less clear.  Ver told CoinDesk meetings will occur at least on a quarterly basis. Voorhees says he expects to take ""several calls per year"" with MGT's cryptocurrency advisory board and affiliated companies. According to Voorhees, McAfee ""rightly"" views cybersecurity and cyrptocurrency as ""intertwined"".  He said:  ""Blockchain assets change the nature of cybersecurity from protecting personal information, which is now less important, to protecting digital wealth, which is increasingly important. I’m excited to see what he’s up to and to contribute to the project.""  But, the Cyrptocurrency Advisory Board is just part of what McAfee describes as a soon-to-be launched cryptocurrency division that would sit alongside new divisions dedicated to areas in military and other forms of security.  In addition to the Cryptocurrency Advisory board, MGT on Friday announced the creation of a Hacker Advisory Board to steer technology development aimed at protecting against cyberthreats. Founding members include Chris Roberts, Bryce Case and Alexander Heid.  ""I’ve identified over a dozen super high-tech products that we’ll be building into MGT over the next six months,"" said McAfee.  Still, McAfee has proven eclectic in his recent project choices.  Earlier this year, he ran for the Libertarian Party’s presidential candidacy before he was appointed chairman and CEO of MGT Capital in May.

42378727,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lfvx,1465934017,'Blockchain-Friendly’ Bill Moves Forward in North Carolina,"Representatives of the blockchain industry spoke today at a North Carolina Senate Finance Committee meeting to advocate for a bill that they believe is among the more favorable seen so far at the state legislative level.  At the center of discussion today was the state’s Money Transmitters Act, and changes to the legislative framework that would update the rules in accordance with guidance issued by the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks (NCCOB) last December.  Sponsored by Senator Rick Gunn, Senate Bill 680 would update the definition of money transmission to include any entity that ""maintains control"" of virtual currency on behalf of others, among more general changes to state law. The law would also codify exemptions for non-financial blockchain service providers, and other business models the industry deems to fall outside of the traditional definition of money transmission.  At today's event, Senator Gunn took the opportunity to state the purpose of the law as it relates to virtual currencies, framing the technology as one whose ""time had come"" in North Carolina.  Senator Gunn told attendees:  “We know that virtual currency transmitters are here to stay, and that they are growing. It’s a sector of innovation, and I think we have a responsibility to try to let them grow and prosper.”  In interview, Perianne Boring, chairman of industry advocacy group the Chamber of Digital Commerce, positioned the bill as the ""most comprehensive and business friendly"" moving forward at the state level.  Boring went so far as to assert that it provided a new template for states seeking to regulate the industry, one in which collaboration was prioritized in rule-making.  “We think that was a commendable thing for the state to do. This is more diplomatic than in New York, and it's how states should be regulating the industry,” she said.  Attending representatives from the blockchain industry included the Chamber of Digital Commerce, IBM and law firm Perkins Coie. Discussion reportedly focused on requirements for money services businesses, the legal status of digital currencies and the need for North Carolina to position itself as a leader in tech innovation.  Following what attendees said would be continued discussion, SB 680 will proceed to a formal Senate vote, after which time it would become law if approved.  Business interests  Yet, while the bill was perhaps crafted for consumer-facing businesses seeking to deal in virtual currencies, IT giant IBM was in attendance to support the potential business use cases it believes could be propelled by the bill.  Vice president of blockchain technologies Jerry Cuomo told CoinDesk that he sees the bill as one that is important to providing public clarity on the technology, a role that he said IBM will continue to play in accordance with its work in the industry.  ""Virtual currency sits in a class of digital assets, which blockchain nicely describes. This topic of digital assets or shared ledgers has to be discussed in general assemblies,"" Cuomo said.  Cuomo noted that IBM plans to continue to educate regulators and lawmakers in the US, echoing concerns the country may be falling behind by providing a more complex legal environment for startups and businesses.  This opinion has emerged as a frequent topic of interest as the industry continues to engage with regulators in the wake of New York’s BitLicense, which was widely critiqued as too expansive and restrictive.

42378720,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lfn9,1465927319,Leaderless DAO Put to the Test Following Ethereum Vulnerability,"A vulnerability in the way some developers are implementing Ethereum has resulted in a last-minute fix to The DAO, a distributed autonomous organization with over $150m at its disposal to invest in Ethereum-based projects.  Without a leader or any formal security team to identify and fix potential security threats, that responsibility falls to an open-source community comprised of members who bought voting rights in the organization with ether as part of its creation phase.  While the identities of some of those involved are still unclear, the method by which the vulnerability was identified and reportedly fixed amounts to the first real-world test of The DAO's structure and problem-solving techniques.  Through the grapevine  The issue kicked off last week, when GitHub user chriseth ""casually pointed out a terrible, terrible attack on wallet contracts"" that could arise from the way some developers were implementing smart contracts written with Ethereum's Solidity language, according to Blockchain Foundation founder Peter Vessenes.  Vessenes' own blog post about the issue then caught the attention of a Reddit user affiliated with the Maker DAO, which is built on the Ethereum blockchain.  The vulnerability, which lets attackers drain one particular type of account, was then successfully tested by the Maker DAO, according to their post, which in turn caught the attention of eththrowa, a user of The DAO members' forum.  Eththrowa confirmed that the vulnerability also existed in the implementation then being used by The DAO, which was built using open-source software written by Slock.it, and is the largest distributed autonomous organization with about $162m worth of ether currently at its disposal.  It was that post that, in the end, caught the attention of Slock.it founder Stephen Tual. He, along with other forum members, promptly responded and a day later posted a link to a fix.  Yesterday, Tual announced a series of upgrades to the project's software designed to combat the vulnerability and other game theoretical attack vectors unrelated to the ""recursive call"" vulnerability as it is now being called.  In his post, Tual wrote:  ""We extend our gratitude to the community ... who once again proved that an open development process leads to the rapid identification, isolation and resolution of potential vulnerabilities, and in this case, the overall improvement of design patterns as part of programming languages.""  No DAO funds were at risk due to the vulnerability, according to a separate post.  Wider issue  Launched earlier this year by an unnamed person or group, The DAO is built on open-source code that lets users collectively vote on how to both disperse funds to projects that members think are worthy and receive dividends if the project is successful.  In this case, the vulnerability would have let a recipient of those dividends ""drain many times his entitlement by calling the contract recursively,"" according to eththrowa.  But as Vessenes' post on Friday made clear, the recursive call threat wasn't about just a weakness in The DAO, but a more general issue with the way some developers implement smart contracts written with the Solidity programming language.  In an email to CoinDesk, Vessenes provided a more technical description of the vulnerability:  ""All public Solidity functions that send money or use ""call"" on another contract may be called recursively by an attacking recipient. This isn't how Bitcoin works, so it might be a surprise to inexperienced Ethereum developers. The practical implication is that each of your functions (and in fact your entire contract) should be 'reentrant', which is to say they should function the same if parts of it are re-called prior to completion.""  The fixes  Ethereum Foundation member Taylor Gerring told CoinDesk that Vessenes' original description of the problem was accurate. However, he added that the vulnerability won't require any changes to the Ethereum codebase to fix.  Rather, the vulnerability requires a different kind of implementation by developers.  In interview, Gerring said the vulnerability ""is a concern insofar as a human programmer may make this problem"" but ""it’s not an inherent problem with Solidity or EVM [the Ethereum Virtual Machine]"", the scripting language and code interpreters that power the network.  Vessenes included two possible solutions to the ""recursive call"" weakness in his post.  Other fixes specific to The DAO's code also announced yesterday by Slock.it are designed to resolve potential issues that some have pointed out regarding the organization’s governance model.  Specifically, these are fixes to certain game theoretical attacks, including what is called a ""yes bias"", which results from a disincentive to cast ""no"" votes. The fixes have been implemented in the form of pull requests on GitHub.  Now it’s up to the 23,000 voting members of The DAO to agree to the changes or push for an alternative solution.  Tual wrote on the Slock.it blog:  ""This is a completely open-source project. Starting today and during the course of a two week review period, everyone including curators are encouraged to review and participate in the release.""

XBT Provider, the operator of Bitcoin Tracker One and Bitcoin Tracker EUR, announced today its acquisition by Global Advisors – a Jersey-based hedge fund specializing in digital currency. With the move, trading in XBT's exchange traded certificates (ETCs) is again active after being halted in late May due to the bankruptcy of KnC Group, XBT's former guarantor and 72% owner.  Nasdaq has approved Global Advisors as the firm's new guarantor. Simultaneously, the XBT Group has also become a Global Advisors subsidiary.  In statements, Daniel Masters, co-founder and director of Global Advisors, took an expansive view of the sale and how it bolstered the firm's offerings.  Masters said:  “We believe bitcoin will change the world. Acquiring control of XBT Group is a unique opportunity to increment our strategy of creating access to bitcoin as an asset class.""  Johan Wattenström, CEO and co-founder of XBT Group, commented that, as part of Global Advisors, his firm now has the ""capabilities and means"" to more quickly grow its business and provide investors with a ""broad range of products and services for safe and easy exposure to bitcoin markets"".  The acquisition comes at a time when institutional investors are demonstrating an interest in digital currencies as an asset class, and mainstream traders are said to be increasingly considering the investment in a search for yield.  KnC, a startup that had raised $32m in venture funding, declared itself bankrupt in May.

42378732,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lfxD,1465907028,Self-Fulfilling Prophecy or Positive Feedback Loop? Bitcoin Traders Question Price Rally,"While the price of bitcoin surged more than 16% between 11th and 12th June, the exact reason for the increase remains a matter of debate.  As reported yesterday, market observers have pegged the rally on a wide range of potential inciting factors, including concerns about China's economic strength, fears of a potential UK exit from the European Union and anticipation surrounding 'the halving' – an upcoming change to the bitcoin network that will find bitcoin miners receiving fewer bitcoins in exchange for transaction processing services.  But the variety of responses would seem to point to larger questions about the recent rally and the dynamics of the bitcoin market.  For example, market experts remain interested in the role miners are playing in the current price increase, and how they, as the sole recipients of all bitcoins minted, may impact trading in the weeks ahead.  As bitcoin prices climb, miners bring in more value for every new block of bitcoins they create. In turn, miners are now able to sell fewer bitcoins and keep more of the reward they obtain by minting new bitcoins, thereby potentially reducing supply.  In short, some like Marco Streng, CEO of bitcoin cloud mining service Genesis Group, believe the bitcoin market could be entering a ""positive feedback loop"" powered by reduced supply.  Streng told CoinDesk:  ""The price of bitcoin influences miner activities and miners influence the price. It's both ways. If the price rises miners need to sell less of their mined returns in order to cover their operating costs. In consequence of this, there is less BTC sold per day by miners which reduces the sell pressure, and therefore gives the price room to rise.""  Still, others pushed back against this idea. Guy Corem, former CEO of bitcoin mining firm Spondoolies-Tech, said that regardless of the behaviors of miners, the price increase was likely spurred by demand.  ""There is external demand, prices are rising, so miners needs to sell less to cover cost, but it doesn't cause further price increase,"" Corem said.  Rather, he said that the halving event has created a perception that supply restrictions will boost price, and the market is simply positioning for this change.  He added:  ""Right now it's the perception that the price will increase around the halving. [It's a] self fulfilling prophecy.""  Increasing volume  Yet, despite this development, most market observers remain convinced that bitcoin prices are spiking due to demand.  Nick Tomaino, a former business development manager for Coinbase, spoke to the robust trading activity that existed over the weekend, pointing to strong volumes as a sign that this represented traders are acquiring bitcoin in greater numbers.  Bitcoinity data reveals that trading volumes hit 2.58m and 2.67m BTC on 11th and 12th June, respectively. These figures represented a sharp increase from the 1.04m BTC transacted on 10th June, and the prior three sessions experienced similar tepid volume.  Tomaino told CoinDesk:  ""The increased volume indicates this is being driven more by demand than supply.""  Another way to analyze the increase is to determine whether the new bitcoin purchases are coming as a result of traders selling fiat currencies or alternative cryptocurrencies.  For example, it remains possible that traders of ether (the native digital asset that powers the Ethereum blockchain), or litecoin, or any other cryptocurrency, are exiting those assets in favor of bitcoin.  Historically, bitcoin and ether have frequently experienced a situation of inverse demand, meaning that investors would switch back and forth between buying ether and bitcoin. At some points, this relationship was strong enough that market experts declared that the two experienced a perfect negative correlation.  However, this situation seems to have changed, as ether’s price fluctuated little amid bitcoin’s rally. What this means, according to ARK Invest’s Chris Burniske, is that the two currencies entered a new trend where bitcoin’s gains do not rely on investors pulling out of ether.  Instead, demand was fueled by an inflow of new fiat currency, stated Burniske, who added:  ""New fiat money flowing into bitcoin makes sense. We typically see a spike in mainstream interest when bitcoin's price starts to spike, as the fear of missing out sets in.""  Macroeconomic buying  Others remain certain that macroeconomic factors are driving increased demand and the price increase.  For example, several market observers told CoinDesk that the concerns regarding China's economy could be heavily impacting demand for bitcoin, and at press time, the narrative is dominating the international news cycle.  This growing adoption has been asserted by Huobi, the China-based, fee-free exchange that is one of top drivers of bitcoin volume, which told CoinDesk that it believes most of its users are buying on demand.  ""About 13% of users invest in bitcoin as a safe-haven asset,"" stated Du Jun, the exchange’s co-founder.  Another development that could be fueling demand is the potential for a 'Brexit'. Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment fund EAM, told CoinDesk that the UK's potential exit from the European Union helped fuel the robust demand that bitcoin enjoyed over the weekend.  The nation’s voters will decide on 23rd June whether the nation will Brexit or Bremain, and should the UK strike out on its own, this development could easily provoke an interest in alternative assets.
