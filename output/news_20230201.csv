8636908,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=518334,1675292413,"Are Nigerians Really Buying Bitcoin For As High As $34,000?","Over the last couple of weeks, reports have emerged that crypto users in Nigeria have been buying bitcoin (BTC) for a pretty hefty premium. On the surface, it may seem that these reports are accurate, but they are essentially wrong, and this report will address how. Nigerians Are Not Buying Bitcoin For $34,000 The reports that have emerged have claimed that Nigerians are currently buying bitcoin at a price of $34,000. These reports take into account the fact that the digital asset is currently selling for over 17 million Nigerian Naira on P2P platforms (which is the only way Nigerians can buy and sell crypto, by the way) but they then U.S.e the official central bank rate of $1 to 459.89 Naira to arrive at the $34,000 figure. Related Reading: Data Suggests Sharks Were Behind Litecoin’s 89% Rise To $97, But What About Now? Now, as previously mentioned, this might seem right on the surface but it is not, and that is because there are currently two different U.S. dollar rates in the country. The central bank rate and the black market rates differ widely. As of February 1, the black market rate for the U.S. dollar to Naira is around 750 which is what the broader population of the country uses. If the price of BTC is converted using the official central bank rate, then it is at the $34,000 figure. But since citizens can literally not get dollars in the country except for official purposes and international school fees payments, and even then it can be a nightmare, the black market rate is what residents of the country go with. Using this black market rate, you will arrive at the same figure as everyone else – the around $22,900 figure that the digital asset is trading at. Besides, you sell your tokens at the same dollar rate you buy them at, not at the CBN dollar rate. BTC price recovers above $23,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com So are Nigerian residents paying a high premium to purchase bitcoin? No. They are rather paying a high premium to purchase the U.S. dollar. This premium on the U.S. dollar affects the buying and selling rate of everything in the country and bitcoin is no exception. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Touches New ATH Following 4.68% Adjustment As for the claims that the price of bitcoin recently rallied more than 50% above the general market price, they are wrong. Bitcoin has always traded in the country at the price of the black market dollar rate, so this is not a new phenomenon in any way either. The only thing that the cash withdrawal limit could’ve triggered in the country is the higher adoption of cryptocurrencies. There was no sudden 50% increase in the price of bitcoin in the last couple of days.

42411236,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKgi,1675291500,Tokenization and the Future of Crypto,"To state the obvious, 2022 was a challenging year for cryptocurrencies. However, in 2023 major structural benefits – such as traditional finance (TradFi) companies still entering the space – are emerging that may support digital assets for years. That extends beyond just crypto’s prospects as an investable asset. Blockchain technology continues to tantalize with features like better security, decentralization, immutability and more. That’s especially clear when it comes to tokenization, or the process of bringing financial and real-world assets onto a blockchain in the form of tokens. And understanding tokenization is key to grasping the long-term investment case for crypto assets.  Despite the crypto bear market, there are signs of life in security tokens. One notable offering was KKR tokenizing part of its Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II (HCSG II) in conjunction with a company called Securitize. But the field is nascent and has a total market cap of only around $90 billion, with $20 billion of that in the secondary market. This is a pittance compared to the hundreds of trillions of dollars stashed globally in real estate and equities.  Tokenized securities have so much room to grow because tokenization creates new on-chain markets for a wide range of nontraditional asset classes. For example, tokens can help create blockchain-based loyalty programs that reward owners with perks for making a certain amount or frequency of purchases. Likewise, membership non-fungible tokens (NFT) can offer rewards such as exclusive features including private events, loyalty perks or early access to new releases. Starbucks, for instance, recently began beta testing Odyssey, a rewards program through which customers can earn NFTs on the Polygon blockchain.  Gaming also has enormous promise. Through a game-and-earn model, tokenization lets players be rewarded with more games and exclusive in-game content. The video game industry generated something like $200 billion in revenue last year, with only about 3% of that tied to game-and-earn. An expansion would be a huge coup for blockchain adoption. Because of this potential, video game projects raised 50% more in venture capital in the first half of 2022 than they did in all of 2021.  It is becoming clear that tokenization has the potential to bring value and liquidity to assets that were previously nontradable. Despite tailwinds in 2022, the creation of on-chain marketplaces for these assets is continuing apace and should support the growth of crypto assets worldwide and the long-term bull case for digital assets broadly.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,CoinDesk Indices ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/01/tokenization-and-the-future-of-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf586aa9ebc9b0c52fa88880cd7146bd809e4d58-3269x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

AllianceBlock has paused all activity on its bridge following the attack, which occurred Wednesday afternoon.

42435080,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdoew6,1675290709,Rocket Pool Community Voting Whether to Self-Limit Its Growth,"Voters governing the protocol for decentralized Ethereum validator service Rocket Pool are grappling with a philosophical proposal that could put bumpers around the ether (ETH) staker’s own growth.  The proposal would establish a set of guiding principles by which Rocket Pool manages its trove of staked ether. Some stakers have gotten too big for Ethereum’s own good, according to author Valdorff, who doesn't want Rocket Pool to become one of them.  “Despite our best attempts to be decentralized and secure, we know that, like any entity, there will always be attack surface,” wrote the pseudonymous node operator in the proposal. “The only thing we can do to ensure the safety of the Ethereum network is to avoid being a single point of failure by limiting our size.”  In the ongoing governance vote set to end on Feb. 12, the vast majority of votes cast have been in favor of establishing guiding principles that would prioritize the long-term health and decentralization of Ethereum over the success of the protocol. The proposal would establish Rocket Pool's preference “to damage itself before endangering the stability of Ethereum.""  Rocket Pool isn’t anywhere close to being a single point of failure for Ethereum: it’s only got 1.66% of staked ETH deposits, well below top competitor Lido, which has 29%, per Nansen data.  “It’s best to capture our ethos early in a concrete form to make it last well into the future,” said Rocket Pool contributors in explaining why the community ought to vote on principles that could self-limit the protocol to 22% of all staked ether, as one community member has suggested.  Rocket Pool General Manager Darren Langley said in a tweet, “As a core team, we fully support limiting @Rocket_Pool, if it threatens Ethereum’s credible neutrality or operational stability.”  Other examples for self-limitation include redirecting a percentage of the decentralized autonomous organization’s income to support small permissionless protocols and a 3% fee to mint rETH, where the fee and percentage of the DAO’s income rise in conjunction with the growth of Rocket Pool’s dominance of staked ETH. Those ideas have been discussed in the community forum but are not being voted on currently.  While the vote – if passed – does not activate or execute any changes to the codebase, “this is probably stronger than a change in code.” said Valdorff, in a Discord message to CoinDesk. “This sets a framework for future code, which allows us to effectively react to the current state, while anchoring values and not letting them invisibly drift over time.”  Healthy staking  The proposal defines four categories of staking – “healthier staking,” “as good staking,” “not as good staking” and “unhealthy staking” – in its effort to impose a decentralization-first mindset to Rocket Pool.  Solo staking, which involves a user running their own hardware, is considered “healthier” under the proposal by being more decentralized, whereas Rocket Pool and fellow liquid staking protocol Stakewise fall into the “as good” category. (Stakewise has previously vowed to limit itself to 22% share.)  But centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance – and even Lido, the most popular liquid staking protocol – are deemed “seriously dangerous to Ethereum’s health” under the proposal. That’s a major accusation given such entities account for 55.5% of all staked ether, per Nansen.  Lido, the largest staking-as-a-service provider, is “explicitly aiming for winner take all,” as stated in the Rocket Pool proposal. ""Winner take all"" refers to the concept where a single entity wins and dominates the entire market of ETH staking derivatives. With over $8 billion in total staking assets, Lido voted against self-limit inbound stake flow in July 2022.  Lido did not return a request for comment by press time.  In Rocket Pool’s Discord, Superphiz, a maintainer of the ethstaker.cc website who also runs a node operator, said “Self limiting benefits Ethereum in the long run, and by extension Rocket Pool. Choosing not to self-limit will harm both groups and lead to less long-term financial reward.”  Users have staked over 377,000 ETH worth roughly $593 million through Rocket Pool. Rocket Pool currently offers 4.19% APR for users to stake and 7.29% APR for users to stake and run a node.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | RPL,Sage D.

But traders began giving back their gains Wednesday as their initial euphoria gave way to the more muted reality of a ruling that hasn’t even happened yet.  LBC was down nearly 4% in the past 24 hours – and more than 16% in the last four – around 5 p.m. ET Wednesday, capping a rally that nearly doubled the price of the LBRY content-hosting blockchain’s native token since Monday, according to data site Sigdev.  Monday was when traders began clinging to speculation that the judge overseeing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against crypto startup LBRY Inc. had ruled the token was not a security – seemingly undercutting the SEC’s November victory in the case.  But that verdict still stands. On Nov. 7, Judge Paul J. Barbadoro ruled that LBRY Inc. offered LBC as securities when it sold them in 2016 – a violation of federal law. LBRY Inc. is shutting down because of the ruling, though its blockchain for hosting decentralized content lives on. As does LBC, the utility token for the LBRY blockchain’s network of content creators and consumers.  In a followup hearing on Jan. 30, Judge Barbadoro said he would clarify that his summary judgment did not apply to secondary transactions of LBC, according to crypto lawyer John Deaton, who was in attendance to argue for the clarification. Judge Barbadoro further said he was disinclined to sign a permanent injunction against the sale of LBC, Deaton said.

Copper is one of the leading crypto custody providers, securing billions of dollars in digital assets using clever key sharding technology called multi-party computation (MPC), and working with well-known firms such as State Street.  ""No clients were compromised,"" Copper said in a statement to CoinDesk.

Despite Copper’s claims that no breach of its code had taken place, two people with knowledge of the situation told CoinDesk the firm’s codebase had been breached and copied.  “There was a serious breach late last year, where one of the developer’s accounts was compromised.

42393862,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brb0JP,1675288394,Crypto Markets Analysis: A Wave of Economic Data Rises on Wednesday With Fed Rate Decision,"Bitcoin climbed in the two hours after the U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did as has been widely expected and raised interest rates 25 basis points.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested in comments accompanying the announcement the bankers had been encouraged by price decreases but remained committed to achieving their goal of reducing annual inflation to 2%. The dovish tilt underscored the success of the Fed’s more aggressive rate increases over the past eight months.  Bitcoin was recently hovering above $23,700, up more than a percentage point over the past 24 hours. Ether saw a similar jump in Wednesday trading. Both have been trading relatively flat in recent days.  But crypto investors had a lot of other data to consider on Wednesday. The U.S. Labor Department’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed job openings increasing to their highest level in five months. The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) purchasing managers index (PMI) for January declined from the prior month, although the January index slightly exceeded expectations.  Both data points indicate a robust U.S. labor market. Persistently strong jobs data has flabbergasted the Federal Reserve, suggesting that the economy was not slowing enough to cool inflation.  Investors will have more information to ponder over the next two days, including initial jobless claims and multiple earnings reports on Thursday, notably Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL), along with unemployment data on Friday.  After surging for more than three weeks, crypto markets have been calm, trading in a tight range. The ""good economic news (strong growth in productivity and a hot job market) = bad news for crypto and other riskier asset prices"" throughout late 2022 has morphed into more of a ""good news = minimal price action"" mantra.  BTC’s price range has narrowed over the last 10 trading days, holding onto its nearly 40% move higher earlier in January. While bitcoin’s price has increased more than 3% over the past eight days, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has decreased 15% over the same time period. This trend is often referred to as a bearish divergence and can be a precursor to price declines.  ETH's price has declined in conjunction with a falling RSI. Prices moving in conjunction with a technical indicator often help affirm a price move. ETH’s recent price decline has occurred while its supply has decreased, which counters conventional thinking about supply and demand.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/01/crypto-markets-analysis-a-wave-of-economic-data-rises-on-wednesday-with-fed-rate-decision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcebab6fc9481d8595a7286840cdf1be3e42d658-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42435092,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdof70,1675288068,"Crypto Investors Can Purchase Bankruptcy 'Put Options' to Protect Funds on Binance, Coinbase, Kraken","Bankruptcy-focused investment firm Cherokee Acquisitions has started offering what it calls “put options” to crypto investors to protect their funds on crypto exchanges Binance, Coinbase and Kraken in the event of a bankruptcy, CoinDesk learned Wednesday from the company.  The put options will protect account holders’ deposits on the listed exchanges, paying back 100% of the assets in the account if the exchange files for bankruptcy protection within the contract period.  Large institutional investors and hedge funds will sell the options and compensate investors in the event of bankruptcy filings, Brian Ferrara, sourcing and trading specialist at Cherokee, told CoinDesk.  The monthly fees of the options are 0.25% to 0.35% for funds on Coinbase, 0.35% to 0.45% for Kraken and 0.45% to 0.55% for Binance Holdings Ltd, the firm said in an email to investors reviewed by CoinDesk.  Cherokee Acquisition is a distressed asset investment banking firm that also has a marketplace for credit claims against bankrupt firms. The firm has been actively structuring deals and buying customer claims for their crypto holdings against embattled crypto firms such as Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and FTX.  The new offering comes as multiple digital asset firms have filed for bankruptcy protection over the past year, freezing withdrawals and locking up investors’ holdings. After November’s spectacular collapse of FTX, the exchange of disgraced entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, crypto traders became wary about the stability of centralized exchanges and the security of their digital assets. As fear grew, they withdrew funds in waves.

This means a Binance account holder with a balance of $1 million who wants protection may buy a put option with a six-month expiry for an estimated price of $27,000-$33,000 paid upfront given the monthly rates. If the firm files for bankruptcy within the contract term, the seller would be obligated to buy the account holder’s valid bankruptcy claim at the full $1 million price.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/01/crypto-investors-can-purchase-bankruptcy-put-options-to-protect-funds-on-binance-coinbase-kraken,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de4207925ba42b525f1178a9390899d52b2cb860-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411241,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKxF,1675287628,"When Regulating Crypto, Please Target the Bad Actors, Not the Asset","There’s no denying 2023 feels a lot better than 2022. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are up about 39% and 33%, respectively, so far this year, on the heels of 60% annual declines.  The U.S. Federal Reserve appears to be winning its inflation battle, improving the macroeconomic landscape and boosting investors’ appetite for riskier things like cryptocurrencies. Both BTC and ETH have price momentum and their trading volume is up, suggesting that bullish sentiment is increasing.  These two giants of crypto – together, BTC and ETH make up about 60% of total market capitalization of digital assets – are succeeding in ways that individual players have not. Do you need to be reminded of the troubles at FTX, Genesis, Gemini, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius ...?  The scandals and blowups of 2022 have set the scene for a regulatory and legislative crackdown in the months and years ahead. People who placed their hard-earned money into entities they trusted lost money – in some cases, years of savings disappeared. The resulting blowback and negative contagion impacted asset prices substantially, causing losses for people who simply owned certain cryptocurrencies. But this was not a problem with the crypto assets themselves. It was the actions of bad actors.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  So where do we go from here? A couple things caught my eye this week. The first was the Jan. 27 “Roadmap to Mitigate Cryptocurrencies Risk” released by the Biden administration. The second was a Jan. 25 forum held by the American Economic Liberties Project, focused on confronting challenges within crypto.  Here are some quotes and ideas that stood out to me:  ”Crypto fraud is a big problem.”  Agreed. Fraudulent activity within the crypto sector has stained the industry and had a significant negative impact on asset valuations. The resultant contagion has created additional uncertainty for nearly all parties involved with cryptocurrencies. I would argue that this is a sentiment shared by many within the sector.  “While cryptocurrency might be relatively new, the behavior we have seen some cryptocurrencies exhibit, and the risks posed by this behavior, are not.”  Again, I don’t see a problem with this. In fact, it gets to the heart of one of my primary thoughts. The turmoil within the crypto sector was caused by individuals engaging in different variations of reckless behavior that has existed for decades. It wasn’t born out of crypto. These things happen outside crypto, too.  Greed and fraud are not isolated to cryptocurrencies, so it confuses me when part of the ire turns to the asset itself rather than towards the people committing fraudulent acts. If I were to be scammed out of U.S. dollars, my issue would be with the scammer, not the greenback.  No one is using crypto as a currency.  This comes across to me as the “no one uses bitcoin to buy coffee” argument. Each time I hear this I raise an eyebrow. Sure, I haven’t come across many people willing to exchange bitcoin for a cup of coffee, though they very well may exist. (Yes, somebody did pay 10,000 BTC for pizza in 2010. Hope it was good.)  Yet, there are arguments bolstering the idea that bitcoin is 1) a store of value, 2) a unit of account and 3) a medium of exchange. Thus, I’d argue that bitcoin upholds the principles of a currency.  But bitcoin is also clearly a commodity. It’s been deemed one within the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act. I’d argue that commodities are purchased for the purpose of hedging risk and/or generating speculative profit. To that end, while it can be used for daily transactions, that’s not optimal. I wouldn’t use wheat or soybeans to purchase a cup of coffee either, but that doesn’t make those things pointless.  Crypto is magic money to trade or buy drugs on the internet.  I see this as an extremely broad mischaracterization of the crypto community. (Also, I’d argue that anyone who thinks it’s a good idea to purchase illegal narcotics via a publicly viewable blockchain is not thinking clearly.) In fairness to those worked up about this, there are ways to disguise illicit transactions, including through the use of privacy coins. Still, a recent Chainalysis report indicates that illicit activity accounts for only 0.24% of cryptocurrency transactions. This is an increase from 2022 and equates to an all-time high of $20 billion.  So, illegal transactions certainly occur via crypto, but I think more focus should be placed on the 99.76% of transactions that are not.  Crypto is not for financial inclusion.  I disagree with this vehemently. People of color both inside and outside the U.S. are largely locked out of the benefits of asset ownership enabled by traditional finance. I believe part of their motivation to get exposure to crypto, whether via ownership or understanding, is to avoid being on the outside looking in. It’s an attempt to gain a foothold quickly before it becomes more challenging to do so, like it tends to be in traditional finance.  I’d submit that it’s often implied that individuals within those communities simply don’t understand the risk involved. And I take issue with that. I would also argue that tremendous opportunity exists not just related to financial inclusion but bridging digital divides. I would welcome initiatives where underrepresented communities gain access to crypto both on the basis of asset ownership, as well as in learning about the technology underpinning it.  Crypto is for speculation.  This is an odd criticism to me because I agree that crypto is used for speculation. I just don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. Any asset I purchase in financial markets is one that I would like to see increase in value. Sometimes the result goes my way … and sometimes it doesn’t. I think it’s perfectly fine to engage in responsible speculation, with informed decision-making, the application of risk management and the expectation of profit and/or acceptance of loss.  Crypto is all a scam.  I don’t see anything positive that can come from this characterization. By the same token, I don’t feel any need to change the minds of people who think this. If someone believes that crypto is a scam, I would 100% encourage them not to acquire it. For those who do believe in the asset, I would encourage them to buy it.  For institutional investors, a shift in the regulatory environment will be impactful in various ways. In some regards a sound regulatory framework could provide them with a clearer landscape in which to operate. Clarity could bring confidence, helping investors decide whether or not to incorporate crypto into their business plans.  We’ve seen a number of traditional finance players begin to dip their toes into crypto waters, and I would expect that more will come over time, under the right circumstances.  All told, I don’t think regulation is an inherently bad thing. I do think that broad mischaracterizations, however, are. In the coming months I hope the focus of legislation focuses on the actors, and not the asset.  – Glenn C. Williams Jr., CMT  Tokenization and the Future of Crypto  To state the obvious, 2022 was a challenging year for cryptocurrencies. However, in 2023 major structural benefits – such as traditional finance (TradFi) companies still entering the space – are emerging that may support digital assets for years. That extends beyond just crypto’s prospects as an investable asset. Blockchain technology continues to tantalize with features like better security, decentralization, immutability and more. That’s especially clear when it comes to tokenization, or the process of bringing financial and real-world assets onto a blockchain in the form of tokens. And understanding tokenization is key to grasping the long-term investment case for crypto assets.  Despite the crypto bear market, there are signs of life in security tokens. One notable offering was KKR tokenizing part of its Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II (HCSG II) in conjunction with a company called Securitize. But the field is nascent and has a total market cap of only around $90 billion, with $20 billion of that in the secondary market. This is a pittance compared to the hundreds of trillions of dollars stashed globally in real estate and equities.  Tokenized securities have so much room to grow because tokenization creates new on-chain markets for a wide range of nontraditional asset classes. For example, tokens can help create blockchain-based loyalty programs that reward owners with perks for making a certain amount or frequency of purchases. Likewise, membership non-fungible tokens (NFT) can offer rewards such as exclusive features including private events, loyalty perks or early access to new releases. Starbucks, for instance, recently began beta testing Odyssey, a rewards program through which customers can earn NFTs on the Polygon blockchain.  Gaming also has enormous promise. Through a game-and-earn model, tokenization lets players be rewarded with more games and exclusive in-game content. The video game industry generated something like $200 billion in revenue last year, with only about 3% of that tied to game-and-earn. An expansion would be a huge coup for blockchain adoption. Because of this potential, video game projects raised 50% more in venture capital in the first half of 2022 than they did in all of 2021.  It is becoming clear that tokenization has the potential to bring value and liquidity to assets that were previously nontradable. Despite tailwinds in 2022, the creation of on-chain marketplaces for these assets is continuing apace and should support the growth of crypto assets worldwide and the long-term bull case for digital assets broadly.  - Pedro Palandrani, Director of Research, Global X ETFs  Takeaways  From CoinDesk's Nick Baker, here's some recent news worth reading:  SUPERLATIVE INFLOWS: Digital-asset investment products got the biggest inflows in six months ($117 million), according to CoinShares. This is not a gigantic sum in the grand scheme of crypto, which is back around the $1 trillion market capitalization mark. But given how bad 2022 was, it’s something for optimists to latch onto.  PAY WITH DOGE? The Financial Times reported that Twitter is laying the groundwork for a payments service. Here’s the tantalizing line from the article for the crypto crowd: “[Elon] Musk has said he wants the system to be fiat, first and foremost, but built so that crypto functionality could potentially be added at a later point.” It’s anyone’s guess how Twitter will emerge from its current turmoil, but a Musk-backed crypto payments system would be appealing to some – and could provide a tailwind to efforts to get crypto into mainstream banking and finance.

In a town hall meeting with community members Wednesday, the founders of the collection laid out their plans for becoming a global brand and utilizing the intellectual property (IP) of the collection to tap into new types of content. With its Blue Cat character as the center of the collection, users will be able to experience its metaverse Cooltopia in new ways that expand beyond its dedicated collector audience.  “This rebrand ultimately signifies a new strategic direction for Cool Cats, one that is focused [on] on-boarding the next wave of members into the Cool Cats community and scaling our brand presence both within and beyond Web3,” Colin Egan, co-founder of Cool Cats told CoinDesk.  Cool Cats is implementing a series of partnerships to broaden their audience such as deploying a float in the famous Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. It’s also teaming up with crypto wallet provider Ledger to create Web3 content via its education platform Ledger Quest, and has additional activations planned involving holograms and gaming.  Additionally, Cool Cats is rolling out a new series of features to enhance engagement among token holders. Some of these include a “Cool Score,” to incentivize collectors to interact with the community and “fracture” NFTs that allow users to partake in storytelling through digital collectibles.  “Whether you're using our PFPs or you're attending one of our events, or you're wearing merch, that is the emotional feeling that we want to enable for everyone in our community,” Jaclyn Woo, director of marketing and strategy at Cool Cats, told CoinDesk. “It's an acknowledgement to our community and our Web3 roots, our communities, the core reason why we're here today, and as we grow and we evolve, we want to continue crafting stories and building products.”  In March 2022, Cool Cats signed with big-three Hollywood talent group Creative Artists Agency to begin to expand beyond NFTs. According to data from secondary marketplace OpenSea, the collection currently trades at a floor price of 2.3 ETH, or about $3,770 with a 117,056 ETH trading volume, or about $191,972,00.  Its derivative collection Cool Pets, which allows users to mint and evolve fictional characters to experience Cooltopia, has a 0.12 ETH floor price, about $190, and trading volume of 30,640 ETH, or about $50,251,240.

The FED Raises Interest Rates The spark in BTC demand is because of Federal Reserve (FED) Chair Jerome Powell’s comments on the general economy and the central bank’s monetary policy stance going forward. In recent months, Bitcoin and crypto prices have been sensitive to inflation readings. News that inflation fell in December 2022 triggered a bull run, with analysts predicting the end of the FED’s hawkish regime in early February. Related Reading: Why Ark Invest Believes Bitcoin Could Emerge As Multi-Trillion Dollar Market Surprisingly, after the FED raised rates, pushing the current fund rate to 4.75%, BTC and crypto prices fell. It was until an hour later when Jerome Powell took to the podium in a highly anticipated presser. Minutes after the chair began speaking, BTC prices rallied from $22,780 to over $23,500, adding about 3.5%. The chair’s comments on inflation and labor expectations and the route the central bank plans to take in the next few months triggered demand across the financial markets, including Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Monthly Signals Stack Suggesting Bulls Are Ready To Stampede Most importantly, Powell relayed what was mostly expected by traders and investors. The chair confirmed that inflation has been improving, decreasing in most core sectors, excluding housing. In December, when inflation dropped to 6.5%, it was the sixth consecutive time the critical metric has been tapering after peaking in mid-2022. While dropping inflation is welcomed, the FED chair said the central bank needs to see more evidence that the critical metric will continue falling in months ahead. Since their intervention and hiking interest rates seem to work, the central bank will maintain a “restrictive stance for sometimes”. Monitoring Inflation Nevertheless, the FED maintains that ongoing rate increases would be appropriate to manage inflation. However, for inflation to fall, the chair adds, the economy has to register below-trend growth characterized by soft labor market conditions. Amid all this, the FED will monitor inflation and “stay the course until the job is done”. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and softening labor market conditions. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. Deterioration of macroeconomic conditions wouldn’t be a concern for the FED because their goal is to see “sustained changes to broader financial conditions” in the long term.

42435078,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdoeta,1675286536,Facebook Parent Meta’s Metaverse Division Lost $13.7B in 2022,"Meta Platforms (META) continued to lose massive amounts of money in its fledgling Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division, which comprises its augmented and virtual reality operations, according to its earnings release Wednesday.  FRL accounted for a loss of $4.3 billion in the quarter, better than the consensus of analyst estimates for a loss of $4.4 billion and up from a loss of $3.7 billion in the third quarter.  For the whole of 2022, Meta lost $13.7 billion in the division on revenue of $2.2 billion, up from a loss of $10.2 billion on revenue of $2.3 billion in 2021. The company has previously said it expects FRL’s operating losses in 2023 to grow “significantly” over 2022 as Meta invests in what it sees as a crucial part of its future.  Meta also reported fourth-quarter FRL revenue of $727 million, down from year-ago division revenue of $877 million, but up from $285 million in the third quarter.  Meta has recently faced investor calls to reduce its spending on the metaverse as falling user growth numbers and reduced ad spending have cut into its profits.  On an earnings call with analysts on Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he expects the Reality Labs ecosystem to grow significantly over the next few years. Meta plans to ship its next-generation consumer VR headset later this year, and Zuckerberg said he anticipates it will “establish this technology as the baseline for all headsets going forward and eventually, of course, for AR [augmented reality] glasses as well.“  As signs of progress, Zuckerberg noted there are now over 200 virtual reality apps in Meta’s ecosystem that have more than $1 million in revenue, and that more than 100 million WhatsApp users have created animated avatars since the feature was launched last quarter. Zuckerberg pointed out that as VR technology develops, “most people will experience the metaverse first on their phones and then will start to build out their digital identities across our apps.”  For the company as a whole, Meta reported adjusted quarterly earnings per share for the fourth quarter of $1.76, missing the analyst consensus estimate of $2.26, according to FactSet, while Meta's overall revenue of $32.2 billion beat estimates of $31.6 billion. It guided for first-quarter revenue of between $26 billion to $28.5 billion, which at its midpoint of $27.25 billion was slightly ahead of the consensus estimate of $27.2 billion. Facebook’s daily active users also hit 2 billion for the first time in the quarter.  Shares of Meta were up 20% to $184 in after-hours trading on Wednesday.

Calls for the reissue come after StargateDAO uncovered a “significant threat” to its protocol owned liquidity (POL) and token holder security originating from security vulnerabilities at the failed crypto quant trading firm Alameda Research.  Alameda purchased 10% of the total STG supply from a Stargate Community sale in March 2022. Alameda promised to lock up the tokens until March 2025 but became embroiled in controversy for illegally borrowing user funds from its sister company, crypto exchange FTX, some months later.

Now a co-founder of an artificial intelligence (AI) software company, created after the viral videos aired, wants people to be more aware of the technology and how they can protect their digital identities.  Blockchain technology, which is immutable, may be just such a tool, Tom Graham, of AI software company Metaphysic, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Wednesday.  “Of all the technologies, distributed systems that help individuals manage their own identity … that’s a really important step in the process of empowering individuals to be in control of who they are in this emerging hyper-real metaverse,” Graham said.  The London-based startup, which recently raised $7.5 million in a founding round, develops infrastructure and technology to expand artificial intelligence-based content, Graham said. But he wants the firm to expand in an “ethical, safe and responsible way.”  That, however, may be a challenge, Graham said, because AI-generated content such as deepfakes could be crossing an ethical line. Deepfakes are a form of manipulated media that can make anyone appear to be doing or saying anything – for instance, Tom Cruise, who was depicted by a person digitally altered to resemble the actor in the TikTok videos.  Walking the ethical line is especially tricky for the company because the Cruise deepfakes began as an art project by co-founder Christopher Ume before the company was formed.  It ""was begun with the purpose of generating awareness for manipulated media, and the potential for what could happen,"" said Graham of the videos. ""Obviously [deepfake] Tom Cruise is kind of irreverent, fun, entertaining content. When it suddenly blew up we contacted Tom Cruise's team and ultimately they didn't have an issue.""  Tom Cruise is not an average person but it is possible images of anyone, without their consent, can be manipulated using AI and become the next TikTok sensation.  Celebrities have lawyers, Graham said, “but what about regular people?”  So finding a way for individuals to own and control their identities ""should be our central purpose"" as a society, he said.  For now, Graham said, his company is “at the forefront of trying to noodle out how to let people protect themselves in this emerging future.”  Read more: What’s the Relationship Between Crypto and AI?

The full-service bank plans to offer its clients cryptocurrency-related services alongside a host of traditional banking services. The acquisition is expected to be finalized toward the end of this year, pending regulatory approval of the transaction, according to the company's press release. Financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.  Although LevelField may become the first FDIC-insured bank to offer crypto services, that does not mean the bank will necessarily offer a safer way to invest in volatile digital assets. FDIC insurance protects bank depositors against losses of up to $250,000 in case of a bank failure, but cryptocurrencies are an asset class that remains uninsured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Burling Bank’s senior management team will remain with the bank as part of the acquisition. The senior team will work in tandem with LevelField’s existing team to expand the bank’s business nationwide.  LevelField’s foray into crypto follows crypto’s growing adoption by traditional finance companies.

Prior to Powell speaking, the Federal Open Market Committee – as expected – lifted its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a new range of 4.5%-4.75%, the highest level in 15 years. In its policy statement, the central bank said “ongoing increases” in borrowing costs will be necessary to further cool inflation.  Data from the CME Group now shows investors pricing in an 86% chance of another 25 basis point rate hike to a range of 4.75%-5.00% at the FOMC’s March meeting.  At his post-meeting press conference, Powell led off in a hawkish fashion, reminding reporters of the destructive nature of inflation and promising the Fed’s commitment to bringing inflation down to the 2% target.  Further along in the press conference, however, Powell said that “[the] disinflationary process has started.” Those words sent bitcoin and traditional equity markets sharply higher.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bitcoin (BTC) was trading as high as $23,627 following the comments, up more than 2% for the day. At press time, it’s settled back to $23,600.

8627980,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=518371,1675279859,Data Reveals Reasons Behind Litecoin’s 80% Rally,"Litecoin (LTC) recently saw an impressive 80% rally after the first ten days of November 2022. According to Santiment, a crypto analytics firm, this remarkable increase results from two key factors. Reasons Behind Litecoin’s Bullish Trend Based on the tweet from the analytics firm, Litecoin’s two major driving forces are its increasing adoption and halving process ahead in 2023. Litecoin is becoming more accepted by merchants due to its low transaction costs and quick transaction times. This fact has allowed people to use it for everyday purchases, such as buying goods online or sending money to others. As a result, the demand for Litecoin has grown significantly in recent months, which has seen the price of LTC surge. Related Reading: Cardano Leads Development With Unique Sidechains And Toolkits Large holders of the token have added considerable money to it, and its adoption keeps increasing. In the last seven months, addresses holding the coin have added about 1.15 million tokens. This event has increased the token’s total supply by 0.5%. According to the Santiment report, several token holders acquired it toward the end of July 2022. At the time, each Litecoin token was trading at a little less than $60, thus, bringing good returns to the holders. Litecoin Halving Ahead, Will It Push The Price Further? A halving is a mechanism to reduce block reward for miners by half. This process intends to keep the cryptocurrency’s supply in check and to help maintain its price stability. Every four years, the network halves the block reward miners receive for mining on the Litecoin blockchain. This action reduces the total Litecoin the network can generate to about 84 million coins. Miners will receive only 6.25 LTC per block when the halving event occurs instead of the current 12.5 LTC reward. As per some analysts, more highs in the price of LTC are expected, considering the upcoming halving slated for August 2023. This event will occur at the time the block height of the token is up to 2,520,000, as it has done in the past. Related Reading: Blockstream CEO Adam Back: How Bitcoin Sidechains Could Destroy Altcoins Generally, the halving event might positively influence its price, but it’s not guaranteed that the coin’s price will sustain its bullish momentum. The LTC price currently trades at $94. Also, its 24-hour price change stands at 0.60% at the time of writing. The information on the 24-hour trading volume of LTC supports the bullish thesis for the cryptocurrency.

Considering the macro conditions and risk of recession, the market remains skeptical of further upside. However, the monthly candle structure also closed with three extremely bullish Japanese candlestick patterns, which could suggest that a bullish stampede is on the way. Why Bitcoin Bulls Could Be Ready To Stampede Bitcoin might be an asset unlike any other, but it is measured using the same price and time axis on charting software, using candlesticks, bar charts, and other chart styles. The use of Japanese candlesticks provides information on each session’s open, high, low, and close. Highs and lows are represented by wicks, also called shadows. Open and closes make up the candle’s “real body.” Depending on how these candles form by themselves or within a larger pattern can tell a lot about what might happen next in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Reaches Critical Inflection Point Against Bitcoin: What Happens Next? The majority of Japanese candlestick patterns come in one, two, or three-candle structures, each with unique names to explain what’s going on during the pattern. Understanding what’s going on within the pattern provides a potential outcome based on probabilities. The more these signal stack up and cluster together, the more powerful the underlying message the patterns are sending the market. It is for this exact reason why last night’s BTCUSD monthly close is worth paying attention to. BTCUSD Monthly: A Tale Of Three Bullish Candlestick Patterns Bitcoin price 1-month charts didn’t just close with one powerful Japanese candlestick-based signal, but three. Morning Star The first is a three-candle pattern called a morning star. The morning star pattern is a potential reversal pattern, consisting of a large black candle down, a doji showing a pause and moment of indecision, and a large white candle that engulfs at least 50% of the black down candle. The more the white candle engulfs the black candle, the stronger the signal. Bitcoin monthly formed a morning star pattern | BTCUSD on TradingView.com The morning star in BTCUSD didn’t just engulf the black candle, it complete erased it and then some. Notably, the rally was able to wipe out the downside created by the FTX collapse – a bullish signal in its own right. The morning star tells a story that bears were in control, but selling became exhausted and bulls easily took charge. A confirmed morning star reversal can lead to up to three to five sessions of upside, or roughly three to five months given the timeframe. Bullish Engulfing The second signal was a bullish engulfing. As the least complex or exciting of the three signals, it still is commonly a reversal signal in the study of Japanese candlesticks. A bullish engulfing also formed on monthly timeframes | BTCUSD on TradingView.com In this scenario, the second white candle must fully engulf the prior black candle. Since the candle was a black doji, bulls had no trouble bursting out of the tight range. Bullish engulfing aren’t as powerful as the other signals, either, but when combined with the rest of the patterns only adds momentum at bulls’ backs. Marubozu The one-month closed as a Marubozu ""open"" | BTCUSD on TradingView.com The BTCUSD monthly closed with a rare and powerful bullish signal called a Marubozu open. This type of candle is extremely powerful and shows utter dominance by buyers. In a downtrend, it can be a reversal signal, or in an uptrend it shows increasing aggression from buyers and a strengthening trend. Technicals could provide enough confluence of bullish signals | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Signals from Japanese candlestick patterns require added confirmation from technical indicators or chart patterns and trend lines. Technical indicators such as the Stochastic and MACD, and statistical tools like the Fisher Transform each suggest a potential reversal according to historical performance on the 1M timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Reaches Line Between Bear & Bull Market For these signals to be valid, bulls must follow through over the next several months. Failure of several bullish signals would otherwise be devastating for the chances of a new uptrend. Time will tell if these early Japanese candlestick signals fully confirm.

8624182,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=518337,1675274444,Why Ark Invest Believes Bitcoin Could Emerge As Multi-Trillion Dollar Market,"Bitcoin has returned to a consolidation state as the macroeconomic dust settles in the coming days. The number one crypto by market capitalization rallied for most of January and is now entering a new month with market expectations of higher profits. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Whale Activities Plummets, Are Whales Getting Bored? As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $23,000 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency still records some profits in the previous seven days at 2%. Other digital assets in the top 10 experienced similar price action except for Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE), which continue to see high profits over the same period. BTC Price Bottom Confirmed By Fundamentals? Per a recent report from Ark Invest, Bitcoin (BTC) recently experienced its second-worst price drawdown since its inception. The cryptocurrency lost over 70% of its value from an all-time high of $69,000, crashing into a two-year low at $15,800. This level coincides with the 2018 all-time high region that peaked at $20,000 and preceded a 77% drawdown to a $3,000 low. Bitcoin bounced into price discovery after experiencing this crash, suggesting that $15,800 will be critical support for future downside pressure. Ark Invest argues that Bitcoin is more robust today and has better fundamentals to continue its uptrend. The BTC Hashrate, the computational power generated by Bitcoin miners, reached an all-time high at 272 exahashes/second in its twelve consecutive years on the rise. The market cost basis for the BTC supply, the average price of the Bitcoin in circulation, stands at $393, almost three times its 2018 value. In addition, 66.5% of the cryptocurrency’s supply remained unmoved over the past year. In other words, long-term Bitcoin holders seem unwilling to move their coins to crypto exchanges to dump them in the market. In that sense, the long-term holder supply stands at 71% and has been increasing since December 10, 2017. All of these factors behind Ark Invest’s bullish thesis compound with the capitulation levels seen in the past two years. As in 2015 and 2017, these capitulation levels could coincide with another bull run. Bitcoin Will Transform Into A Financial Behemoth In the short term, Bitcoin will still face selling pressure from macroeconomic conditions, persistent inflation, and other global events. However, Ark Invest believes the cryptocurrency will become a central piece in global financial markets in the coming decade. As seen in the chart below, the investment firm has three targets for BTC in this period. In the bearish scenario, BTC will hit a price of $258,000 by 2030, and in the bull scenario, BTC could climb as high as $1.5 million per coin.

The decentralized storage system with smart contract-integrated Web3 applications will be powered by BNB tokens, according to the project announcement. The system aims to grant users and decentralized applications (dapps) complete ownership of their data, allowing the system to support website hosting, publishing, data storage and personal cloud applications.  Community developer teams from Amazon Web Services, NodeReal and Blockdaemon aim to launch the BNB Greenfield testnet within the next few months, according to the white paper.  The BNB Chain's newest decentralized offering comes at a time when Binance is ramping up its influence in the decentralized finance space in the wake of the collapses of several high-profile centralized crypto exchanges. The network’s previous iteration, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), attracted criticism for being too centralized and susceptible to rug pulls.  The release of the decentralized storage system’s white paper was having a modest effect on the price of other storage tokens on Wednesday.

According to data from secondary marketplace OpenSea, the Dooplicator collection, which allows tokenholders to generate digital wearables in the new collection, has a 0.66 ether (ETH) floor price, which is roughly $1,000. The trading volume has risen quickly and has hit a total of 12,897 ETH or about $20,312,775 at the time of writing.

42412987,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7FOq,1675267302,Decentralized Exchange Dexalot Starts a Hybrid DeFi Subnet,"Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) Dexalot has launched on layer 1 protocol Avalanche as a subnet, attempting to combine the user experience of centralized exchanges (CEX) along with the transparency and decentralization of a DEX.  Dexalot’s users will be able to deposit and withdraw assets via its app on the Avalanche C-chain, and then trade on the Dexalot subnet, according to a press release.  The communication between the mainnet and subnet will be through “generic message passing using cross-chain communication protocols,” the company said. This may reduce slippage in trade execution and will allow traders to have confidence without giving up custody of their assets, the company added. Slippage in this context refers to the difference between a trade’s expected price and the price at which the trade is executed. Slippage tends to happen when markets are volatile.  The launch comes at a time when there’s a sense of uncertainty towards centralized exchanges following the collapse of FTX in November. Users are increasingly migrating away from centralized exchanges since the fallout, with DEXs seeing a spike in trading volume in November, according to data from DeFiLlama.  Read more: Centralized Exchange (CEX) vs. Decentralized Exchange (DEX): What’s the Difference?  “By using both the host chain and the exchange chain, we have optimized Dexalot for speed and safety,” said Cengiz Dincoglu, co-founder of the DEX.  Dexalot’s dual-chain app establishes a base for expanding to other host chains to enable mass adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), according to the press release. The Subnet implementation will build a foundation for interoperabilities within multiple ecosystems, which can be created on top of, and around Dexalot, the press release added.

Rally communicated the shocking message to its users via email that said the Rally sidechain would start winding down on Tuesday, January 31, the same day the firm sent the email. Rally Close Down Sidechain Amid Difficult Market Conditions Explaining the reason behind the unusual move, Rally cities 2022 has been a difficult year. It said the year was not only challenging for the platform but also for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Cardano Leads Development With Unique Sidechains And Toolkits Rally said although its team made attempts to create a new path for the business continuation, the firm has been unable to overcome the ongoing challenges and negative macroeconomic factors that began last year. Rally CEO Rob Collier explained that they would start winding down the platform immediately because of a lack of support at work. The CEO admitted that funding was the major obstacle for the company. He said the firm developed its sidechain in 2018, but the mainnet has been extremely expensive to maintain compared to all of the new layer-1 blockchain tech stacks that the firm recently launched. Rally said the sidechain is no longer supported, and therefore, users may experience a decline in NFT services or may soon become inaccessible. Rally network is an Ethereum-based platform that enables creators to launch their social tokens. It allows musicians, team sports, and personalities to engage with and monetize their independent communities through direct engagements on the platform. Rally has become the latest victim of the ongoing crypto winter, which has so far led several crypto firms to announce bankruptcy protection and impose massive layoffs. The new year started with several challenges brought forward by the previous one. The crypto winter is still causing troubles and has shown no signs of slowing down. Over the past months, there have been cases of job cuts, companies announcing losses, and regulators heightening their oversights. Several adverse crypto events have defined the beginning of 2023, with crypto lending firm Genesis laying off 30% of its workforce, crypto exchange Huobi cutting 20% of its workers, and crypto-focused bank Silvergate Capital Corp. letting 40% of its staff go. Rally price action Following the announcement, the value of the native token RLY went down by about 10% to $0.01353. At the time of writing, Rally trades at $0.012498.

42412984,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7FM2,1675265359,Bitcoin Little Changed on Soft Economic Data Ahead of Fed Meeting,"Private hiring slowed to its weakest level in two years, according to the ADP National Employment Report, with just 106,000 jobs added in January. In addition, the manufacturing sector continued to contract, with the ISM Manufacturing Survey for January dipping to 47.4.  An index reading above 50 indicates an expansion of the manufacturing segment of the economy compared to the previous month. A reading of 50 means no change. A reading below 50 suggests a contraction.  Bitcoin (BTC) barely noticed the news, continuing to trade flat over the last 24 hours at just above $23,000. After a brutal 2022, the crypto has moved higher so far this year, in part as many are expecting a slowdown in the economy and inflation, and perhaps easier monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve.  The ADP report of 106,000 jobs added was a slowdown from an upwardly revised 253,000 in December and well shy of economist forecasts for 180,000. It was the weakest report since a negative print in January 2021. The ADP took note of weather-related disruptions (such as the California rainstorms) during its survey reference week in the middle of the month.  Coming in at 47.4, the ISM survey was down from 48.4 in December and short of expectations for 48.0. It was the weakest level since May 2020. ""The U.S. manufacturing sector again contracted, with the Manufacturing PMI at its lowest level since the coronavirus pandemic recovery began,"" said Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Business Survey Committee. The New Orders subindex – considered a forward-looking indicator – plunged to 42.5 from 45.1 a month earlier.  Later on Wednesday, the results of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will be released, with markets expecting the FOMC to hike its benchmark federal funds rate by just 25 basis points to the 4.50%-4.75% range. The market will be focused on the committee's statement to determine whether or not the Fed intends to continue to raise interest rates or whether it is mulling a pause in the tightening cycle at the FOMC's next meeting in March.

42412992,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7FTW,1675264210,Judge Bans Sam Bankman-Fried From Contacting FTX Employees and Using Signal,"A New York judge has prohibited Sam Bankman-Fried from attempting to contact any former or current employees of Alameda Research or FTX.  Bankman-Fried has also been prohibited from using Signal or other ephemeral messaging applications.  The decision to amend the FTX founder's bail conditions, issued by U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan on Wednesday, comes after federal prosecutors filed a letter with the court on Friday asking for the former FTX CEO's bail conditions to be amended.  Prosecutors claimed that Bankman-Fried had reached out to at least one employee – identified as Ryne Miller, the current general counsel for FTX US – to allegedly attempt to influence his future witness testimony.  “I would really love to reconnect and see if there’s a way for us to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources when possible, or at least vet things with each other,” the DOJ’s letter quotes Bankman-Fried as saying to Miller.  In his decision issued Wednesday, Judge Kaplan said that Bankman-Fried's lawyers' attempt to characterize his communication with Miller as ""benign"" was not a persuasive one.  ""Subject to hearing counsel's argument, the message in its entirety seems to be an invitation for [Miller] to align his views and recollections with the defendant's version of events and thus make their relationship 'constructive,'"" Kaplan said. ""In perhaps more colloquial terms, it appears to have been an effort to have both the defendant and [Miller] sing out of the same hymn book.""  Bankman-Fried's lawyer, Mark Cohen, objected to the prosecution's proposed amendments to his client's bail, saying his client needed to communicate with some former employees, including his therapist, George Lerner.  “Requiring Mr. Bankman-Fried to include counsel in every communication with a former or current FTX employee would place an unnecessary strain on his resources and prejudice his ability to defend this case,” Cohen said. “Many of these individuals are Mr. Bankman-Fried’s friends.

42411234,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKa6,1675264192,Why Venture Capitalists Won’t Be Held Accountable for Investing in FTX,"Charges have been filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against three top FTX executives, including Sam Bankman-Fried, but this is certainly not the end of the SEC’s probe. Earlier this month Reuters reported the SEC is also seeking information from financial firms (yet to be named) that made significant investments in FTX regarding their due diligence processes used prior to investing in FTX.  Tal Elyashiv is the co-founder and managing partner of SPiCE VC.  While this particular area of the investigation is not necessarily an indication of any wrongdoing, the abundance of venture capital funds associated with, and deeply invested in, FTX raises some questions. Specifically, the SEC is focusing on details about what policies and procedures venture firms had in place when they chose to invest in FTX, and whether they were followed.  Jumping on the FTX bandwagon (despite red flags)  The list of FTX investors who in aggregate invested over $2 billion, and subsequently had to write it all off, spans an impressive “who’s who” of well-known investment firms, including NEA, IVP, Third Point Ventures, Tiger Global, Insight Partners, Sequoia Capital, SoftBank, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Temasek Holdings and BlackRock.  It also includes the Ontario Teachers' pension fund, one of Canada's largest pension funds, with nearly $250 billion in assets under management. It will write down the entirety of its $95 million investment in FTX.  That’s quite a lot of money flowing into an organization that had an accounting firm in the metaverse, no board of directors, a questionable corporate domicile and was highly leveraged from the very beginning, among a list of other “red flags.” So, what gives?  See also: Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle  Each of the VC funds that invested in FTX said it conducted an appropriate amount of due diligence. That includes Temasek Holdings, which stated it spent eight months of due diligence without identifying a single red flag.  While I’m not in a position to Monday-morning quarterback the VC/FTX bandwagoning, it’s undeniable that serious questions are being raised by the SEC and others. Were the funds acting responsibly on behalf of their own investors when they poured money into FTX as part of their fiduciary duties? How is it possible that not one of FTX’s investors noticed anything amiss? And is VC groupthink what led to all of this?  While these questions about due diligence deserve answers, the issue is also about oversight. Did these investors exercise any oversight on how these funds were being deployed at FTX?  See also: SEC Investigating FTX Investors’ Due Diligence: Reuters  When it comes to FTX, (and many others, including Terraform Labs, Celsius Network, BlockFi, CoinDesk sister company Genesis, etc.) the stopgaps and oversight failed. We expect regulators to protect investors from fraud and mismanagement of their investment, while investors expect and rely on investment managers to do proper due diligence on investment and make risk-reward decisions as part of their fiduciary duty.  This delicate balance of oversight, trust and accountability failed because, let’s face it, FTX was the cool thing to invest in.  VC groupthink  This isn’t the first-time venture capital and private equity money followed the shiny object, throwing caution to the wind and betting the house. Remember the dot-com bubble? Apparently, investors in FTX forgot because a cool kid who wore wrinkled shorts, never made his bed and lived in a Bahamian penthouse wooed them. While Sam Bankman-Fried’s rap sheet of fraud continues to grow, his single greatest fraudulent accomplishment, in my opinion, was the massive heist of the global VC market. The “Crypto Kid” gave VCs a reason to swoon, and many of them fell in line without seemingly questioning a thing.  What’s next for VC investing?  According to Politico, to potentially avoid another VC groupthink fail, the SEC is working on a rule that would preclude private funds from seeking indemnification for simple negligence, effectively making it easier for limited partners (LP) in such funds to sue these funds. This will, presumably drive higher accountability and will, hopefully, result in deeper due diligence and oversight on the part of fund managers. However, this issue has implications that go beyond just direct investors and often impact institutional investors, pension funds, etc.  Sounds good, right? But not so simple.  While I strongly believe VC funds and their managers carry significant responsibility to their LPs and must do their best to make investment decisions based on solid due diligence and according to fund policies, my prediction is the FTX-related VC probe is unlikely to amount to much from a regulatory perspective.  See also: FTX’s Collapse a Wake-Up Call for Venture Capitalists, Dragonfly Partner Says  Even if some VC fund managers did little more than blindly follow Sequoia Capital in investing in FTX, it will be very hard to justify regulatory change from a singular event and a relatively small number of VC funds. In essence, LPs are rarely promised specific due diligence procedures, or requirements related to corporate governance, etc. LPs know this is a high-risk asset class, and that general partners often have little time to access the most popular deals. If they're dissatisfied with the fund’s performance, they can (and do) vote with their feet during follow-on fundraising.  Also, LPs are already allowed to sue for gross negligence, which covers reckless or purposeful acts. However, expanding liability to simple negligence would effectively enable LPs to sue every time a deal goes bad, which would add a significant amount of unruly risk and cost to the VC business, which will be passed on to investors and portfolio companies alike. Furthermore, most LPs will not take advantage of such rights because earning a reputation as being overly litigious will preclude them from participating in future deals . No one wants to work with a tattletale.  Take risk, but don’t be reckless  To quote Taylor Swift (no, I’m not a Swifty), VCs need to “keep their side of the street clean.” As mentioned before, participating in the venture-capital ecosystem is inherently risky. VCs make bets on early-stage companies, but those bets should be educated, informed and researched. Furthermore, once the decision to invest in a startup is made, there should be an adult in the VC room making sure that whatever investment was made is being used wisely and for the right reasons.  There’s no scenario in which a VC fund can guarantee a unicorn (a privately held startup company with a value of over $1 billion) or even modest positive returns – and that’s OK. Investors who are not comfortable with those odds shouldn’t be in the VC market. There will always be winners and losers, just like with the stock market. So instead of opening the litigation floodgates, let’s hold the fraudsters accountable and allow responsible VC funds to continue to invest in innovation.

While the rally seems to be nonstop, one thing worth noting is that the frontline cryptos seem to be lagging behind at the backend. On Tuesday, On-chain analysis platform Glassnode reported that whale participation on Bitcoin and Ethereum is fading away. The Bitcoin amount of supply last active for 3-5 years has recorded a two-year low. Glassnode added that total Ethereum wallets holding 10,000 ETH tokens and above have also plummeted to a 1 month low. Bitcoin And Ethereum Whale Activities Drops As reported by Glassnode, Bitcoin’s 3-5-year supply had dropped to a two-year low, at 2,144,828.279 BTC, lower than its previous low, which was around 2,144,844.528 BTC. Ethereum whales have also followed suit. The number of wallets holding 10,000 ETH and more dropped to a one-month low of 1,194 ETH. The lowest level recorded before this figure was 1,195 ETH which was seen as of January 30, 2023. Following the Glassnode report, communities in the crypto market are beginning to wonder and suggest that whales might be getting bored. However, Bitcoin and Ethereum are part of the crypto assets that have gained significantly since the beginning of the year. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Holds Ground And Sees Fresh Rally, Bulls Are Not Done Yet Bitcoin, in particular, after dropping by over 50% from its all-time high amid the crypto winter, is beginning to indicate a rebound as it has recently crossed the $23,000 mark. Similarly, Ethereum, after dropping nearly 60% from its peak, has recently crossed $1,600, achieving a two-month high since bear season. Furthermore, Glassnode said that the number of Bitcoin wallets holding at least 1,000 BTC plummeted to a three-year low of 2,027, affirming the concept that whales might be lacking interest in Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap. Are Whales Getting Bored? Though it may seem like whales are getting bored, given the proven report from Glassnode, both crypto assets are still moving significantly in price and trading volume. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin trading volume had surged from $12.9 billion, seen early last month when BTC traded at the $16,000 region to above $31.9 billion with a market price ranging above $23,000. Related Reading: Time To Sell Bitcoin And Crypto? ‘Big Short’ Michael Burry Tweets ‘Sell’ Its market cap also mirrored the upward movement surging by 39% in the past 30 days from $322 billion as of January 1 to $443 billion on February 1.

ETH’s market cap has also increased 31.8% in the last 30 days from $146 billion on January 1 to $190 billion as of February 1. Meanwhile, ETH is currently in an uptrend at the time of writing, up by nearly 1% in the last 24 hours. The price chart indicates a further upward momentum as after a retracement comes a reversal. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is up 1% in the last 24 hours. Looking at the price chart, BTC has been consolidating for the past few days.

The grant will be used by the university, the second-best in the U.S. for blockchain in a CoinDesk ranking, to fund research in developing an approach to scale the performance of blockchains by building a secure, decentralized log on top of a Byzantine-tolerant database. Such a database mitigates the risk of a thinly distributed network of nodes, which can result in a network attack such as a 51% attack.  “We are delighted to support the work of Professor Alvisi’s students as they not only research novel blockchain systems but also develop real-world, scalable use cases and applications to benefit the future of the industry,"" said Aptos Labs Chief Technology Officer and co-founder Avery Ching.  The company also said Stanford University Professor of Computer Science Dr. Dan Boneh has joined as an adviser. Stanford ranked third in the U.S. in the CoinDesk study; the top spot was taken by University of California-Berkeley.  Aptos' grant follows in the footsteps of Cardano, which funded a $4.5 million research hub at Edinburgh University in November.

Whilst sentiment remains positive on the whole, concerns have been raised over tokenomics and the lack of activity on the network in comparison to layer 1 competitors such as Ethereum.

Voyager creditors argued that Alameda’s claims should either be equitably subordinated to all other creditor claims, or recharacterized as equity. The creditors said that Alameda’s “inequitable and fraudulent conduct” cost Voyager and the creditors between $114 million to $122 million.  Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchangeFTX had around $1.4 billion in cash as of the end of 2022, according to an interim financial update filed on Wednesday. The figure is around 19% higher than the $1.2 billion reported in November when FTX filed for bankruptcy. Among the various arms of Sam Bankman-Fried's fallen crypto empire, FTX US has $260 million in cash. Bankman-Fried has repeatedly claimed the U.S. wing is solvent. Last month he blogged that FTX US ""had at least $111 million, and likely around $400 million, of excess cash on top of what was required to match customer balances.""  ARK Invest maintains its prediction that bitcoin prices will hit $1 million by 2030. Fundamentals are sound despite a turbulent 2022, according to the ARK's 2023 Big Ideas research report. “Contagion caused by centralized counterparties has elevated Bitcoin’s value propositions: decentralization, auditability and transparency,” writes Cathie Wood and team. ARK backs up this claim by pointing to a higher hashrate, long-term holder supply, and addresses with a non-zero balance compared to the prior downturns.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the dollar index's (DXY) 12-week percentage range of change since 1990.  The DXY has depreciated by 9% in the past 12 weeks, a steep decline that has brought cheer to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  In the past, the U.S. dollar has bounced after sharp declines of the magnitude seen in recent weeks, meaning the rally in crypto markets could soon hit the wall.  – Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Bitcoin and Hang Seng's Stalled Rally Might Mean Wider De-Risking Ahead, TradFi Firm Says  Bankrupt Lending Platform Celsius Names Users Eligible to Withdraw Assets  Bitcoin's Blockchain Data Offers Evidence of Continued Investor HODLing During Bear Market",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/01/first-mover-americas-bankrupt-with-14b-cash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/507966c5651c101570bbc8ea2d1258dd83091798-4608x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

8616078,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=518326,1675260008,Binance Lauds United Kingdom’s Proposals To Properly Regulate Cryptocurrencies,"Binance, a top cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes and client count, has praised the United Kingdom’s decision to consult as they look to establish a framework that will see cryptocurrencies better regulated, spurring adoption in the region. HM Treasury Report Released In a tweet on February 1, following the United Kingdom’s HM Treasury sharing a report detailing the future financial services regime for crypto assets on the same day, Binance said they are welcoming steps taken by the government. #Binance has vocally supported the need for effective and appropriate regulation to help with mainstream adoption of digital assets. We welcome the next steps from the UK Government in making this happen with the @hmtreasury’s publication of plans to regulate crypto activities. — Binance (@binance) February 1, 2023 The report sets out proposals for the United Kingdom’s financial services regime for crypto assets, including Bitcoin. It also highlights the risks and opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies. The report builds on previous HM Treasury proposals, which primarily focused on the role of stablecoins in crypto and the promotion of digital assets. Related Reading: Coinbase Exec Accuses Binance Of Crypto Price Manipulation HM Treasury said the current proposals “marks the next stage of the UK’s phased approach,” and seek to make the region a leader in technology and innovation around digital assets. With proper regulations, HM Treasury believes providers will operate their businesses with certainty while also being in a better position to manage consumer and stability risks. All consultative processes will close on April 23, 2023. Bitcoin Price on February 1 | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView Binance: Proposals Will Promote Crypto Innovation It should be noted that recent events, including the collapse of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, partly advised HM Treasury’s proposals. In November 2022, the Bahamas-Based FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States, taking billions of user funds with it. Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO, is under house arrest after posting a $250 million bond. His criminal case is ongoing in New York. The fact that users, including those from the United Kingdom and the United States, lost funds in FTX could fast-track the development of laws around custody. In the United Kingdom, the HM Treasury admits that there is “no regime for crypto-asset custody” and industry feedback has picked out different models used to custody digital assets. This state of regulatory affairs, they note, could cause harm to investors, especially if the custodian files for bankruptcy. Related Reading: Binance Announces New Transaction Limit By Fiat Partner – What Could This Mean For BNB? Binance believes a stable regulatory environment will spark innovation and create trust. These are the two ingredients that will foster long-term growth in the industry. Subsequently, the exchange is reviewing the details of the report’s consultation and is looking forward to contributing to the process. In 2021, the United Kingdom’s watchdog, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), banned Binance Markets Limited from undertaking any regulated activity in the region, citing weak measures to protect clients. The ban follows their withdrawal from registering with the FCA in May 2021, claiming they wouldn’t meet strict anti-money laundering requirements.

42412991,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7FRe,1675260000,Luxor Starts First-of-Its-Kind Bitcoin Mining Rig Marketplace for Large-Scale Orders,"Bitcoin mining services firm Luxor Technologies is starting the industry's first unified marketplace for new mining machines so that buyers and sellers can directly connect through a request-for-quote system (RFQ). The crypto mining market is flooded with stock offloaded by struggling companies.  The marketplace comes when thousands of discounted machines have further overwhelmed an already inundated market. In 2022, the industry did not have enough infrastructure to plug machines into and start bringing in revenue, so hundreds of thousands of machines were left unused.  As the bear market hit the sector, miners started selling more machines, further depressing prices. The price of mining rigs has dropped about 85% in the past year, data from Luxor shows.  In the new platform buyers and sellers can create requests for machines in an open-bid system and directly negotiate prices. Currently, the market operates primarily through brokers, including Luxor. That is an an ""opaque and regionally fragmented market"" that Luxor's RFQ system will unify, thereby ""improving price discovery and increasing liquidity in the secondary market,"" the firm said in Wednesday press release.  Compass Mining also aggregates listings for mining rigs on sale on a separate platform. However, the volume is small, with listings mostly ranging between one to ten machines.  Brokers can sign up to the platform and Luxor will essentially stop acting as a broker. Luxor will take a commission from the party that responds to the request, whether it is a seller or a buyer, which will also encourage market making on the platform, said Colin Harper, head of content and research at Luxor.  About $1.6 million worth of deals have closed so far on the first day of the platform's operation.  Bankruptcies of giants in the space including Celsius Mining and Core Scientific could mean more mining rigs for sale.  ""Before, buyers and sellers relied on a patchwork of venues to buy and sell mining hardware. Now, they can observe offers, listings and settlement prices all in one place, which improves pricing transparency and expedites the mining hardware procurement process,"" Luxor Operations Manager Lauren Lin said in the press release.

The high-profile innovation-focused investor highlighted the importance of AI and the convergence of technology platforms in a “Big Ideas 2023” investor report. Wood and her team outlined that market participants should be looking at five converging innovation platforms that have the ability to “define this technological era.” At the center is artificial intelligence, with robotics, multiomic sequencing, public blockchains and energy storage orbiting nearby. ARK believes that these technologies can together provide exponential growth into the future of the global economy. The firm predicated that AI training cost reductions continued at an annual rate of 70%. To put that into perspective, the cost to train a large language model to GPT-3 level performance dropped to $450,000 in 2022 after being near $4.6 million in 2020, ARK noted. “We expect cost declines to continue at a 70% rate through 2030.” See the below graphic on the projected declining cost of AI, according to ARK. Wood stated: “We've been working on artificial intelligence for a long time now, and I think some of the things we're seeing are just the beginning of the impact that artificial intelligence is going to have on every sector, every industry, and every company.” Wood’s 2023 big ideas report added: “The market value of disruptive innovation platforms could scale 40% at an annual rate during this business cycle, from $13 trillion today to $200 trillion by 2030. In 2030, the market value associated with disruptive innovation could account for the majority of the global equity market capitalization.” While Wood didn't offer specific stock picks, potential AI stocks include names like C3.ai ( AI ), as well as firms providing the technology backbone for advancements in the space, like Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Ambarella ( AMBA ). Meanwhile, many of the big tech names are deep into AI as well. This includes Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ), Apple ( AAPL ) and IBM ( IBM ). Other big ideas for 2023 that Wood and her team are focusing on include digital consumers, digital wallets, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), smart contract networks, precision therapies, electric vehicles, autonomous ride-hail and orbital aerospace.

The device, which comes on the heels of a $5 million funding round led by Acuitas Group Holdings in August, will be shipped to customers as early as April, according to a press release.  Customers will be able to mine and earn PKT, a fork of bitcoin launched in 2019, every minute the Mini is connected to the internet. Customers also earn PKT from sharing their Wi-Fi with others.  The Mini, which retails for $499, has a larger and more expensive sibling, the “Cube,” which PKT Pal launched at the end of 2021 at a hefty $2,500 per device.  The PKT Pal business model resembles that of Nova Labs, the company behind the Helium blockchain, a decentralized telecommunications network powered by the HNT token. Josh Berger says PKT Pal’s focus on building high-speed networks for everyday use instead of low-speed networks for internet of things (IoT) devices, sets it apart.  “There's not a big market right now for IoT,” Josh Berger, co-founder of PKT Pal, told CoinDesk in an interview. “So when we created the PKT network, it was very much focused on a high-speed network that people could, you know, watch Netflix on.”",POSITIVE,HNT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | HNT,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/01/pkt-pal-expands-its-crypto-powered-wifi-device-lineup-with-launch-of-the-mini,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4de14ca03c47a024697bb8ceb14b115c24a5788-6000x4200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what it means for Bitcoin. Stablecoin Circulating Supply Moving Averages Close In On Death Cross As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, if the stablecoin supply doesn’t increase, a bear market could return for Bitcoin. The “stablecoin circulating supply” is an indicator that measures the total amount of stablecoin tokens that are currently in circulation. Generally, the main reason why investors use stables is for escaping the volatility associated with most of the assets in the cryptocurrency market. Such holders may keep their stablecoins ready with them to convert into volatile coins whenever they feel that prices are right to jump back in. When these investors do swap their stables back for coins like Bitcoin, they provide buying pressure to them and hence give a bullish boost to their prices. Because of this reason, the stablecoin circulating supply may be looked at as a store of buying pressure that can be deployed into any of the assets in the market at any point. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the stablecoin circulating supply 21-day and 100-day moving averages (MAs), as well as in the Bitcoin price, over the past year: The values of the two metrics seem to be approaching each other in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant The year 2020 saw some sharp growth in the stablecoin circulating supply, which, according to the quant, led to the Bitcoin bull run observed in 2021. This trend makes sense as the stablecoin supply rising shows that more capital is entering the cryptocurrency market. From the chart, it’s visible that this increase was taking place until the February of last year, following which the indicator reversed its direction and started decreasing instead. Related Reading: Santiment Explains Why Bitcoin Saw A Pullback During The Past Day This decline in the metric led to the 21-day MA crossing below the 100-day MA. Interestingly, this crossover seems to have coincided with the bear market kicking off for Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency sector, which means that this may have acted as a death cross for the market. The short-term MA stayed below the long-term one throughout the bear, but recently, just as the current rally kicked off, a reverse cross took place in which the 21-day finally rose above the 100-day. This boost in the stablecoin circulating supply might have been what has provided the fuel for the latest move in the Bitcoin price. In the last few days, however, the indicator seems to have once again been dropping off, as can be seen in the graph. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Move Large Amounts, Bearish For DOGE? The 21-day MA is now once again near the 100-day MA and is at risk of forming another death cross. “If the circulating supply of stablecoins does not increase further, I think the crypto market will enter a bear market again,” cautions the analyst. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $23,000, up 2% in the last week.

42394476,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8KKZ,1675253700,"What Is the Ethereum Blockchain’s Shanghai Hard Fork, and Why Does It Matter?","In March, Ethereum will undergo its first big upgrade – also known as a ""hard fork"" – since its shift to a proof-of-stake system in September. Once Ethereum’s upcoming “Shanghai” upgrade completes, 16 million staked ether (ETH) will finally become withdrawable by the validators that help operate the network.  Although the main focus of Shanghai will be implementing Ethereum Improvement Proposal-4895 – the change that unlocks validator withdrawals – the update’s full roster of changes has just been finalized, and it includes additional upgrades that are sure to be noticed by Ethereum app developers and many of the chain’s users.  What is EIP-4895?  The star of Shanghai is EIP-4895, which will free up validators to withdraw the 16 million ETH that they have thus far “staked” to help secure the network.  When Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in its last big upgrade, dubbed the Merge, the network began using validators instead of miners to add blocks to the blockchain. Validators must stake 32 ETH with the chain in order to participate in the block validation process. Each staked ETH acts like a kind of lottery ticket: The more ETH a validator stakes, the more likely they will be selected to “propose” the next block of Ethereum transactions and earn some network rewards.  Before validators agreed to participate on the PoS blockchain, they were made aware that their staked ETH and any accrued rewards would remain locked up until a subsequent update to the chain. Validators have been staking ETH and accruing rewards since December 2020, when Ethereum released its PoS “Beacon Chain” in its first step towards the Merge. Now, those validators will finally be able to cash out their stake.  What is the importance of the Shanghai hard fork?  EIP-4895 is the main focus for the upgrade, given that stakers may want to start cashing out any rewards they’ve earned over the past two years – or simply get more control over their funds, given the uncertainty in crypto markets over the past year.  But in addition to accessing locked up funds, the PoS blockchain has not been fully featured ever since it went live. Even though the blockchain functions properly today, stakers have had to commit to keeping their funds locked in order to keep Ethereum running. Now with the mechanism that will unlock staked ETH, the full operation of a proof-of-stake blockchain will come to life, meaning that stakers can finally have control over their funds and decide what they want to do with their rewards.  Read more: Ethereum in 2023: Here’s What to Look Forward To  How can a validator unstake its ETH?  If you are running a validator, there are two options for unstaking your ETH once Shanghai goes live. The first is setting up a “withdrawal credential,” which will automatically unstake the accrued rewards you’ve earned from your validator. The second option is to fully exit the Beacon Chain and unstake all 32 ETH, by having your validator voluntarily send a message that it is removing itself from the blockchain.  As for how soon you can access the ETH you want to unstake, “it depends on how many people will unstake at a time,” Marius Van Der Wijden, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk. Only 16 partial withdrawal requests can be put into a slot (which happens every 12 seconds), and there is a single queue for both full and partial withdrawals on the blockchain. But the likelihood of all validators choosing to exit the blockchain is slim, given that staking will enable a new chapter for Ethereum and those that trade on top of it.  Are crypto traders rushing to sell their ETH?  As a new era of unlocked ETH begins, crypto traders are paying attention to how the market may move. Some traders believe that there will be some sell pressure once staked ETH is unlocked, while other traders say Shanghai will only encourage more staking.  Currently, there’s about 1 million ETH of accrued rewards that is available to be withdrawn immediately once Shanghai is live. Traders will be watching whether the unlocked ETH will be instantly cashed out and if it pushes the price of ETH down.  Read More: Crypto Traders Are Already Placing Bets on Ethereum’s 'Shanghai Hard Fork'  What else is in the Shanghai hard fork?  The four smaller EIPs included in Shanghai relate to gas fees – a kind of tax that users pay to transact on the Ethereum blockchain. Gas fees can be expensive during times of high activity, and Ethereum developers are aiming to add in mechanisms that will reduce high gas fees for those building on the blockchain.  EIP-3651 proposes to access the “COINBASE” address, a software used by validators and block builders, at a lower gas cost. (Aside: This is totally unrelated to the crypto exchange Coinbase.) The code change could improve Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) payments as well as other user-experiences according to Matt Nelson, a Product Manager at ConsenSys.  “This EIP corrects a previous oversight on the cost to access the COINBASE address and gives some added benefits to users and developers that open up new use-cases,” Nelson told CoinDesk.  Other EIPs in the package are:  EIP-3855 – creates a code dubbed “Push0” that will lower gas costs for developers  EIP-3860 – puts a cap on the gas cost for developers when interacting with ‘initcode’ (a code used by developers for smart contracts)  EIP-6049 – will notify developers of the depreciation of a code known as “SELFDESTRUCT,” which also relates to reducing gas fees  What’s next for Ethereum after the Shanghai hard fork  Developers decided to keep the scope of Shanghai relatively small, mainly so that staked ETH withdrawals would be released as soon as possible. As a result, some other big changes to the Ethereum protocol were pushed back from Shanghai to the third quarter of 2023.  Those include “proto-danksharding,” an admittedly ominous-sounding term that simply refers to a method of making the blockchain more scalable by splitting up the network across several chains, or “shards.”  Also on the horizon are changes to EVM Object Format (EOF), which includes several small upgrades to improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

42410873,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsCu2,1675252505,"UK Crypto Firms to Get Broad Laws, May Need New Authorization","Proposed U.K. laws to regulate crypto suggest the jurisdiction might overtake its rival, the European Union, in the race to govern the sector.  A long-awaited consultation, originally promised for before Christmas, was published on Wednesday. It proposes a new authorization regime for any company operating from the U.K. or serving local clients – and has gained an immediate, and largely positive, reaction from the industry.  “As the voice of the U.K.’s crypto sector we welcome this positive step towards greater regulatory clarity,” said Ian Taylor, board adviser of lobby group CryptoUK. “Given the provisions within the proposed legislation, consultation with the industry could not be more critical.”  International crypto exchange Binance also said it welcomed the plans.  “Binance has vocally supported the need for effective and appropriate regulation to help with mainstream adoption of digital assets,” the company tweeted. “We welcome the next steps from the U.K. Government in making this happen.”  The U.K. Treasury has previously said it wants to make the country a crypto hub, with new rules needed to restore confidence after a turbulent 2022 – but firms that battled through a lengthy regulatory process to secure registration for money laundering purposes will hardly relish having to do it all again.  Register again  Crypto should be brought under existing rules laid out in the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) dating back to 2000, the Treasury said – arguing that the alternative of a bespoke regime, of the kind introduced in the EU by the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA), would overlap, distort competition and create confusion.  As such, the new regime would require crypto companies to register, to follow rules set by the Financial Conduct Authority and to meet anti-financial crime rules that are tougher than the money laundering regulations (MLR) under which firms are approved now.  “Crypto firms already registered under the MLR regime and carrying out those activities would be required to also seek authorization under the new FSMA-based regime,” the document said – a comment likely to generate apprehension from those who already dealt with the FCA.  Companies have already complained about lengthy delays and tough FCA procedures under the existing money-laundering rules. Just 41 companies out of a total 300 that applied under the existing system succeeded in gaining regulatory approval, and now face the prospect of having to seek additional authorization.  Where, what and when  The new regime has a broad scope in terms of geography, crypto types and activities. Foreign trading venues could be forced to set up a subsidiary in the country given their “critical role in the crypto asset value chain,” the document said. It would also apply to utility tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFT) if they are being used for financial services such as lending, payments or investment.  Currently the FCA only has oversight over companies based in the U.K. and that operate a crypto entity in the country. Extending it to anyone serving U.K. clients could prove significant – meaning that some of those 300 companies that opted to go abroad after failing to register would now have to gain FCA approval to serve clients in the country.  Read more: UK Finance Ministry to Propose Broad Rules for Crypto, Invites Industry Feedback  Crypto lenders would have to have clear contractual terms and adequate financial resources to avoid a repeat of collapses such as Celsius Network, Voyager Digital or BlockFi. That implies the U.K. could run ahead of its rivals in the European Union because MiCA doesn’t cover crypto lending.  The Treasury also wants to include a market abuse regime to prevent illicit activity from happening and to sanction practices that manipulate prices via pump and dump schemes, fake activities such as wash trading or anticipating trades through front running.  Regulations for stablecoins tied to fiat currency and used as a means of payment are already set out in the existing Financial Services and Markets Bill, and the next phase of rulemaking would cover a broad range of activities including operating an exchange, investment, lending and crypto custody. Algorithmic stablecoins like the ill-fated terraUSD are deemed risky and potentially volatile, and should be treated like other unbacked cryptos such as bitcoin (BTC), the document said.  A further third tranche of activities including crypto mining, post-trade activities like clearing and decentralized finance could be left until later, the paper suggested, while a few other areas – such as whether to regulate crypto staking and how to advertise the environmental impacts of crypto – still hang in the balance.  “There may not be justification to regulate the activity of mining in and of itself,” the consultation said, but added that it was interested in considering rules in linked areas like miner extractable value – where miners choose how to sequence transactions to maximize profits from other traders.  The consultation highlights problems in trying to supervise decentralized finance, a borderless business in which there’s no obvious entity to regulate. Ideas floated include regulating people who establish or operate a protocol, or code audits. However, the Treasury said it wants to wait for international norms and for greater clarity on the legal status of the decentralized autonomous organizations responsible for governance.  The consultation is open for comment from crypto firms, financial institutions, academics and others until April 30.

DeFi Is Not Dead In a Medium post on February 1, Andre agrees that the crypto bear market of the past year impacted activity and forced users to preserve assets, swinging to stablecoins. Even with this, at spot rates, he argues, on-chain metrics and yield readings from various DeFi protocols, including in Yield Finance, point to a possibly undervalued DeFi market. He compares the current yields of various coins and stablecoins, including USDT, USDC, and DAI, an algorithmic stablecoin issued by MakerDAO, with those of early 2020 as offered by Yield Finance. Daily APR https://t.co/BAcrlUTqrQ$DAI 8.75% dominated by @bzxHQ. Static since they introduced 9% fixed rate, they own it.@USDC ~4% @compoundfinance and @dydxprotocol fighting over dominance.$USDT comfy at 20.75% at @AaveAave (insane)@CurveFinance $DAI strong at 9.11% pic.twitter.com/dtadzP8Wx2 — yearn (@iearnfinance) February 5, 2020 Then, DeFi was gaining traction, and the total value locked (TVL) had crossed the $1 billion mark. At present, DeFi TVL exceeds $47 billion and, at one point, stood at over $170 billion at the peak of the last rally. By late November 2021, BTC was trading at over $69,000. Early 2020 marked the early stages of a protracted bull market that lasted two years to the end of 2021. Presently, the ETH, USDT, DAI, and USDC real yields are relatively higher than in 2020. Andre notes that this is amid an inactive market following the losses of last year. Generally, real yields offered by DeFi protocols are from the lending market and trading fees. At the moment, Andre assesses that everyone who had shorted had sold their coins but appear not confident to exit, which is why he is confident the current yields are “really low” despite being relatively higher than in early 2020. Related Reading: Time To Sell Bitcoin And Crypto? ‘Big Short’ Michael Burry Tweets ‘Sell’ Considering this development, he disagrees with people who think DeFi is dead and periods of high yields are long gone. He argues that this assertion is based on comparing the “current market with an unsustainable and highly delusional market peak, and not its progression.” He explained: If you plot a growth chart on TVL, yield, and trade volume, and you flatten the curve to avoid oscillating, it is a clear linear growth chart. Andre maintains that DeFi works as designed and doesn’t need a new narrative or a “shiny toy”. Taking Charge DeFi provides an alternative to users who would otherwise not participate in traditional finance. The ecosystem comprises decentralized exchanges, insurance protocols, investment platforms, and more.

The 1,400-page document filed with a New York bankruptcy court on Tuesday shows the company has court permission to distribute 94% of each user's assets. While eligibility is contingent upon certain criteria – for instance, transfers had to be less than $7,575 when they were made – withdrawals will be processed only if the users have enough assets on the platform to cover any withdrawal fees, and only if they update ""specific customer information related to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) information.""  ""Whether and when Eligible Users are entitled to a distribution of the remaining 6% will be determined at a later date by the Court,"" the filing said.  While Celsius, which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022, has secured court approval to process certain customer withdrawals, the controversy around its actions leading up to the bankruptcy filing continues.  A report by an independent examiner revealed the lender had used new customer deposits to fund other user withdrawals in the days leading up to July 12, when it imposed a withdrawal freeze.  ""Celsius’ problems did not start in 2022. Rather, serious problems dated back to at least 2020, after Celsius started using customer assets to fund operational expenses and rewards,"" Shoba Pillay, the examiner, said in a separate filing Tuesday.

A similar pattern has emerged in Hong Kong's benchmark equity index Hang Seng.  That has one traditional finance (TradFi) observer mulling a possibility of a renewed risk aversion across all corners of the financial market.  ""Failures in BTC and Hang Seng are technical warnings signs that these early 2022 halcyon vibes may not last all year,"" Brent Donnelly, trader and president of Spectra Markets, said in a note sent to clients late Monday.  Donnelly's comments are evidence of bitcoin's strengthening reputation as an advance indicator of risk sentiment among seasoned traders. In the past, the world's largest cryptocurrency has led major tops and bottoms in the S&P 500 by several weeks.  Bitcoin fell by nearly 4% on Monday, turning lower from $24,000. A similar bull failure was seen above $24,000 in August.  The Hang Seng has also turned lower from resistance, which can be traced back to June 2022.  ""The bitcoin chart looks a bit like the Hang Seng chart on page 1,"" Donnelly noted. ""BTC got to $24,000, just shy of the $25,100/$25,400 pivot. This is another reason for caution on risky assets.""  Stocks, bonds and cryptocurrencies have chalked up a steep rally in recent weeks, while the U.S. dollar has declined in hopes that the Federal Reserve would pause interest rate hikes in May and cut rates later this year.  The Fed is likely to lift the benchmark borrowing cost by 25 basis points to a new range of 4.5% to 4.75% on Wednesday. Analysts expect Fed President Jerome Powell to push back against market expectations for rate cuts during the post-rate decision press conference, putting a downward pressure on risk assets.  Donnelly believes several uncertainties are on the horizon that could zap the risk appetite.  ""With so many scenarios in play this year (no landing, soft landing, recession lite, hard landing, crash landing) ... I don't think the market is all that likely to land on the correct answer in the first weeks of 2023.

A federal court in Boston ruled the 52-year-old Crater will also have to serve three years of supervised release. He was convicted in July of wire fraud and money laundering after being charged in 2018 by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Crater’s firm offered virtual payment services through a fraudulent digital currency known as “My Big Coins,” which were marketed to investors between 2014 and 2017, defrauding them of more than $6 million. He and his associates claimed the coins were a functioning cryptocurrency backed by $300 million in gold, oil and other assets. They also falsely told investors the company had a partnership with Mastercard and that My Big Coins could be easily exchanged for fiat currency or other virtual currencies, CoinDesk had reported.  Crater ""saw the growing crypto marketplace as an opportunity to create the illusion of My Big Coin as a legitimate service from which investors would yield a profit. His lies and deception inflicted real trauma, pain and hardship on the lives of 55 individual victims and their families who funneled their money into bank accounts,"" U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins said in the statement.

42413003,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7Fb0,1675243631,ARK Invest Maintains Prediction Bitcoin Price Will Hit $1M by 2030,"Despite a severe downturn, public blockchains continue to foster multiple revolutions; one of them is Bitcoin, says ARK Invest in its 2023 ""Big Ideas"" research report.  That's why the bitcoin (BTC) currency, in the eyes of ARK, is still predicted to close the decade at $1 million because its fundamentals are sound – despite a turbulent 2022.  “Contagion caused by centralized counterparties has elevated Bitcoin’s value propositions: decentralization, auditability and transparency,” ARK writes. “Its network fundamentals have strengthened and its holder base has become more long-term focused.”  ARK backs up this claim by pointing to a higher hashrate, long-term holder supply and addresses with a non-zero balance compared to the prior downturns.  Because of this fundamental soundness, ARK says, bitcoin continues to outperform traditional asset classes.  On a five-year CAGR basis, bitcoin is up an average of 272% while global equities are up by 6.1%, global debt provided a yield of 1.4% and gold is up by 2.2%.  This isn’t the first time that ARK or its CEO, Cathie Wood, have made such bold predictions on bitcoin’s upwards trajectory. In May 2021, Wood made her first bold price prediction during an interview on Bloomberg, predicting bitcoin will go to $500,000 by 2026. In early 2022, she then upped the ante to $1 million by 2030.  ARK has also been quite bullish on Coinbase (COIN) throughout December and January, continuing to enlarge its COIN position by buying around $30 million shares.  COIN is up 74% in the last month, outperforming bitcoin.  While Wood and ARK are known for their positions and opinions on bitcoin, the report also touched on smart contracts and decentralized finance.  “As the value of tokenized financial assets grows on-chain, decentralized applications and the smart contract networks that power them could generate $450 billion in annual revenue and reach $5.3 trillion in market value by 2030,” according to the Ark report.  ARK’s Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 31% in the last month, while its Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) is up 32%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/01/ark-invest-maintains-prediction-that-bitcoin-prices-will-hit-1m-by-2030,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c11d0ec2b6afc6b73dfb7364afd5fc2a7fbe8f29-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For ages, mainstream social media platforms have been accused of morphing into government machinery and used to violate privacy and other rights. There have been reports of censorship and political suppression in the United States, as detailed in “Twitter Files.” Twitter Files are a set of internal documents from Twitter, the social media company. They were declassified and released to the public in December 2022 by Elon Musk and journalists, including Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss, after Elon Musk took over Twitter in late October 2022 after a $44 billion deal. Related Reading: Elon Musk Lifts Twitter Ban On Dogecoin Accounts; DOGE Pumps 7% – Here’s What Happened Decentralizing Social Media Jack Dorsey donated 14 BTC, roughly worth $250,000, in late 2022 to fund the development of the alternative social media platform, Nostr, which promises decentralization and control of data and accounts. Unlike the rails behind Twitter and Facebook, Nostr is open source. It aims to build a decentralized social network to power a modern social platform. Instead of a centralized server, Nostr is powered by distributed and decentralized clients. Anyone can create an account in Nostr. However, unlike the usual username and password, the decentralized nature of the underlying architecture requires users to create a public key (username) and a private key (password). These accounts can be created on Damus, for iOS users, and Amethyst, for Android users. Nonetheless, there are other ways of creating an account in Nostr, including on the open web, snort.social. Moreover, a user can create multiple keys should there be a need for so. Notably, any user is free to run a client where they can, at any time, log in to their account (public key), and share posts or write articles after signing in with their private keys. Whenever the post is shared with another client, the information is relayed trustlessly throughout the network, like how BTC and crypto transactions are distributed to all nodes in the platform. Related Reading: Twitter Working On Its Own Crypto Wallet Prototype The function of relays in Nostr is to forward share posts and content media to other clients.

42412988,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7FNu,1675242000,"Market Maker B2C2 Teams With Blockdaemon, Stakewise to Provide Ethereum Staking Liquidity","Crypto market maker B2C2 has teamed up with blockchain infrastructure firm Blockdaemon and staking protocol Stakewise to provide liquidity for staked ether (sETH), according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk.  B2C2 says it will be the sole over-the-counter (OTC) spot liquidity provider for the digital receipt token sETH-h, built on liquid staking platform Portara. Users that have staked ether on the Ethereum blockchain will be able to use sETH-h tokens to exit their positions or earn rewards elsewhere in the crypto ecosystem.  Liquid staking is the process whereby users are given derivative tokens in exchange for their staked digital assets, in this case ether (ETH). The derivative tokens can then be used for other purposes, while the ETH remains locked in the proof-of-stake system. Ahead of Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade, which is set to take place in March and will allow ETH stakers to withdraw their tokens, interest in liquid staking has been growing as users have sought ways of exploiting the ETH currently locked on the network.  The liquid staking market is dominated by decentralized finance (DeFi) app Lido, in which users had locked $7.8 billion as of the middle of last month. Its native token, LDO, more than doubled in value in January to $2.08.

42413002,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7Fa4,1675240631,"Bitcoin Could Be in the Later Stages of the Bear Market, On-Chain Data Suggests","Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent uptrend was met with euphoria and skepticism as prices rallied 40% in the past month – despite ongoing contagion effects spread by the fall of centralized crypto players.  Bitcoin slipped to as low as $15,700 in November as the crypto market deal with the insolvency of crypto exchange FTX and bearish sentiment in global stock markets. Prices mostly ranged between $15,700 and $17,500 until the first week of January.  The cryptocurrency has surged since then, alongside growth in ether (ETH), decentralized finance (DeFi) markets and the broader equity market. Before retreating, bitcoin reached five-month highs above $23,500 earlier this week as traders took profits.  However, some analysts say that while overall market sentiment cannot be called bullish just yet, the recent price and on-chain data suggests that bitcoin could be in the later stages of a bear market.  “Although current bitcoin performance suggests that the bottom might already be in, we are not out of treacherous waters yet, as we have not seen a full year pass since the 2022 bear market rally,” analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex said in a markets note this week.  “Early 2020, before the third bitcoin rally of eight green candles, was a time of massive volatility amongst bearish macro conditions; this might be what we experience now in the first and second quarters of 2023,” the analysts added.  The note cited Glassnode that suggested short-term holders (STH) of bitcoin selling now at profit while long-term holders (LTH) continue to hold massive spot positions – a move that “looks increasingly bullish for bitcoin.”  However, the macro sentiment remains a cause for concern.  “Since the asset class is currently highly correlated to the U.S. stock market, bearish macro developments can restrict the asset (bitcoin) from repeating past performances,” Bitfinex analysts said.  Meanwhile, selling pressure on bitcoin from miners, a key part of the Bitcoin ecosystem, hit three-year lows last week.  As reported by CoinDesk last week, on-chain flows show the amount of bitcoin transferred from miner addresses to wallets owned by exchanges has declined to multi-year lows.  Miners are entities that supply computing power to any blockchain network in return for “rewards” in the form of tokens. These rewards are continually sold by miners to cover operational costs – which are fairly intensive. Some miners filed for bankruptcy protection last year – and liquidated holdings, contributing to selling pressure in the market.  Dwindling miner sales imply weaker selling pressure from those responsible for making coins and are generally viewed as bullish.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/01/bitcoin-could-be-in-the-latter-stages-of-the-bear-market-on-chain-data-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fde84cadb8f296129e099039722986883421e527-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42435106,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdoj3u,1675240347,Bitcoin Price Could Reach $45K by Christmas: Matrixport,"U.S. institutions have probably been behind January’s rally in bitcoin (BTC), when the cryptocurrency gained more than 38%. An outperformance this early in the year tends to be bullish for the token’s price, crypto services provider Matrixport said in a research report Wednesday.  In five of the six years that bitcoin has rallied in January, the cryptocurrency has ended the year with positive returns. On average, the gain the rest of the year has been more than 245%, wrote Markus Thielen, head of research.  The only year when bitcoin declined after a strong January was 2014, when prices had just made a bull-market peak, the note said.  Matrixport says the driver of the 2023 bull market could be the expected March 2024 bitcoin halving cycle, when the amount of the cryptocurrency entering the system every 10 minutes drops by 50%. Therefore, there is a high statistical probability that the bitcoin price could double from here until year end, the report said.  This means the bitcoin price could reach $45,000 by Christmas, the report added.

The “Big Short” investor tweeted a single word today, “Sell.” Sell. — Cassandra B.C. (@michaeljburry) February 1, 2023 Burry is known for being one of the few experts who predicted the subprime mortgage crisis from 2007-2010. He shorted the mortgage bond market in 2007 by swapping CDOs and made big profits. Already on Jan. 23, Burry shared a chart of the market from the dot-com crash on Twitter and said “maybe.” He seemed to be circling a dead cat bounce, where the S&P 500 index rallied 20% over the turn of the year from 2001-2002 before falling another 30%. Today’s latest tweet can be interpreted that Burry is currently expecting a similar scenario, presumably triggered by today’s announcement of the Fed rate decision in the U.S. and the subsequent FOMC meeting where Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will talk about the latest data and expectations. Related Reading: Santiment Explains Why Bitcoin Saw A Pullback During The Past Day Given Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 and macroeconomic influence, Burry could also be sending a warning signal to crypto investors. The S&P 500 and Bitcoin have rallied sharply from their lows since inflation data has come down sharply in recent months. However, an unexpected Fed decision could be a dagger. Nevertheless, it is also important to point out that Burry has not always been right with his forecasts in the past. In fact, Burry was wrong more often than right in the past, as a Reddit user revealed. Bitcoin And Crypto Bulls Should Be Warned While a whopping 98.4% expect the Fed to continue to slow the pace of rate hikes today, according to the FEDWatch Tool, this puts the market in a vulnerable state. If the Fed does surprisingly hike by 50 basis points and expresses concerns about “sticky” inflation, it could mean a massive crash for the S&P 500, Bitcoin, and the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready To Break Trough $24K, Vital Signs Provide Clues And there are growing voices that 25 bps is not yet set in stone. According to Bloomberg, hedge funds have built up record short positions in U.S. Treasuries ahead of the FOMC meeting. They expect yields to rise, the DXY to spike and the S&P 500 to crash – which could spell doom for Bitcoin. But there are also strong voices in favor of a 25 basis point hike. Fed mouthpiece and Wall Street Journal chief economics correspondent Nick Timiraos said in a tweet yesterday that “the ECI report is helpful for the Fed, which is on track to raise rates by 25 basis points this week.” He went on to say that “a slower pace of wage growth could ease concerns that wage inflation will settle at a frighteningly high level for a central bank targeting 2% inflation.” At press time, the Bitcoin price was at $21,113, remaining relatively stable with the FOMC meeting just hours away.

42435105,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdoj4k,1675237603,Cardano-Based Djed Stablecoin Has Attracted 27M ADA Tokens as Reserve Backing,"Cardano-based overcollateralized stablecoin Djed (DJED) has attracted over 27 million cardano (ADA) tokens as backing less than a day after launch, data shows.  As of the time of writing, Djed has a reserve ratio of nearly 600%, meaning each djed is backed by six times its value in ADA. At current prices, the ADA locked for issuing djed is worth over $10 million.  The highly anticipated djed stablecoin has been jointly developed by Cardano code maintainer IOG and Coti, a layer 1 blockchain.  Djed will be backed by other tokens and requires between 400% and 800% in collateral value to be posted before it is issued to a user.  This overcollateralized mechanism would allow djed's value to be stable during market stress and prevent a repeat of terraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin linked to the Terra system's luna token, which fell in value by over 99% in May.  Shen, the reserve token meant to support djed's stability, would receive extra rewards when holders of Cardano's ADA cryptocurrency stake their coins to mint djed stablecoins, which may fuel liquidity for the upstart ecosystem.  This may increase user demand for shen, and in turn a surge in price in the coming weeks as djed is integrated with more Cardano-based applications that add to its utility.  As of Wednesday morning, djed has a circulating supply of 1.7 million tokens, while shen has a supply of 20 million and is worth 38 cents apiece.  The djed tokens – alongside annualized yield rewards offered by the decentralized exchanges (DEX) – are expected to attract liquidity and interest from investors owing to their overcollaterized mechanism, which may benefit Cardano's $91 million decentralized finance (DeFi) market.  Some Cardano DeFi projects, such as Fluid, have already integrated djed stablecoins as liquidity against loans. Last week Cardano DeFi exchange MuesliSwap told CoinDesk it targeted annualized yields of 10% to 25% for djed users.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/01/cardano-based-djed-stablecoin-attracts-27m-ada-tokens-as-reserve-backing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfa9129660d4d98600f636688e5537cc394023ff-3085x2314.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now we have the evidence.  Bitcoin's HODL Waves indicator created by Unchain Capital and tracked by Glassnode shows that the percentage of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) older than five years has increased by 17% in the past six months.  The HODL Waves indicator tracks the UTXO age distribution. UTXO is the amount of cryptocurrency someone has after executing a transaction. Every BTC transaction creates a UTXO. Its age indicates the block it was first included in and the last time the said bitcoin was moved.  So the latest sharp rise in the percentage of UTXOs older than five years indicates aging of unspent outputs, a sign of some investors maintaining their coin stash during the market swoon.  Joe Burnett, head analyst at Blockware Solutions, called the aging of UTXOs a bullish development, in response to a tweet by Capriole's founder Charles Edwards referring to the UTXO data as proof of long-term holders accumulating coins at the fastest pace in eight years.  Bitcoin traded near $23,100 at press time, having rallied nearly 40% last month, per CoinDesk data.  UPDATE (Feb. 1, 2023, 11:05 UTC): Updates headline for clarity.

42435103,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdoj0Y,1675234961,"India's Crypto Tax Amendment Could Punish Evaders With Jail Time, Attorneys Say","India has maintained its restrictive crypto tax rules from 2022 in 2023, while adding a potential fine or jail time for non-compliance to the provision around tax deducted at source (TDS), according to three attorneys speaking to CoinDesk.  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not mention crypto, virtual or digital assets, blockchain or central bank digital currencies on Wednesday while unveiling the nation’s 2023 budget, which indicates the latest tax rules. But hidden in the fine print was a change to TDS rules that affects virtual digital assets (VDA).  Last year, the world's largest democracy instituted stiff taxes on crypto transactions: a 30% tax on profits and a 1% TDS on all transactions.  The 1% TDS remains but until now no provision in the law imposed a penalty for failure to comply, if a citizen tried to evade paying the tax or made an incomplete payment. A retailer could argue in court that no penalty is prescribed, getting away with just tax liability. Now a fine equivalent to the tax liability and/or jail time of 3 to 84 months could be imposed in case of non-compliance.  The amendment proposes a fine and possible imprisonment for at least three months and possibly up to seven years, said crypto tax adviser Anoush Bhasin, who is also a founder of Quagmire Consulting.  Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, a partner at Nangia-Andersen LLP, explained that this was specific to crypto to crypto transactions, saying the bill seeks to ""amend the penalty and prosecution provisions.""  ""Penal provisions entail a penalty equal to the amount of TDS deductible and prosecution with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than three months and which may extend to seven years with fine,"" he said.  India's Parliament still has to adopt the provision and enact it into law, but given Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party controls both houses of the legislative body, this seems likely. The provision would take effect on April 1.  In the nine months after the tax rules on crypto were announced, Indians moved more than$3.8 billion in trading volume from local to international crypto exchanges. The ""hidden"" change is expected to target retailers using foreign exchanges.  ""Indian retailers who are on foreign platforms usually use [peer-to-peer] mechanism to buy and sell crypto,"" said Rajat Mittal, a crypto tax lawyer at India's Supreme Court. ""A retailer who is responsible for making payment to a buyer on P2P platform is liable to deduct TDS. If users don't deduct TDS now they could be made liable for penalty of 100 percent in addition to TDS liability already imposed and the possibility of 3- to 84 month jail term.""  But this may not be all bad for the crypto ecosystem as it might incentivize retailers to return to local exchanges.  ""Until now there was no penalty for non-deduction. Budget 2023 has now established that,"" said Ashish Singhal, a co-founder of Indian crypto investing app CoinSwitch Kuber.  ""This is to say, don’t try to avoid TDS by using offshore or non-compliant platforms. You may be penalized as per Section 271C of the Income Tax Act. If you are investing in crypto, use a tax-compliant platform,"" he said.  Alternatively, the penalty written into the law in 2023 could provide even less incentive for crypto traders than after the rules in 2022. Last year the industry had predicted the year would lead to a ""period of pain.""  This proved to be ostensibly true, even if there were other contributing macro economic factors. Crypto trading volumes plummeted almost immediately and interest in crypto nosedived.  Several individuals closely working in the crypto regulatory space had publicly said they were hopeful for a tax cut, but privately said that it was unlikely, CoinDesk reported earlier this week.  The primary demand from the industry and recommendation from policy think tanks was to reduce the TDS to 0.01%, or at minimum to 0.1%.  No changes to existing crypto taxes has left ""Indian crypto companies on the stairway to heaven,"" said Rajagopal Menon, vice president of Indian crypto exchange WazirX. ""We hope that the government will reconsider its position on crypto taxes.""  Sumit Gupta, the co-founder of CoinDCX, another Indian exchange, said this was ""not good for our country and those building in this sector in India"" but that he was still ""committed to partnering with the government to devise policies that are conducive to the sustainable growth of the ecosystem.""  India has kept a crypto bill in cold storage since early last year, saying crypto regulation cannot succeed without global coordination – something it's prioritized with its agenda-setting power as this year's G-20 president.

Voyager creditors argued that Alameda’s claims should either be equitably subordinated to all other creditor claims, or recharacterized as equity.  The creditors said Alameda’s “inequitable and fraudulent conduct” cost Voyager and the creditors between $114 million to $122 million. The creditors cited prior caselaw that says the court may “rearrange the priorities of creditors’ interests and to place all or part of a wrongdoer’s claim in an inferior status, in order to achieve a just result.”  Alameda, according to the creditors, made a series of false statements to Voyager and its creditors’ committee about its financial strength claiming at one time to have a “bottomless sea of ordinary cryptocurrency.""  These claims are why Voyager’s creditors’ committee voted to support the selection of Alameda as the buyer of Voyager’s balance sheet by the slimmest of margins, according to court filings.  “Had the committee known the truth, it never would have allowed the AlamedaFTX [sic] deal,” the filings read. The creditors went on to add that Alameda’s conduct may even constitute a felony.  For its part, Voyager, in court documents filed earlier, says that “Alameda has caused the Debtors and their creditors substantial harm” because they “made a bid for the Debtors’ business that they could never satisfy” under false pretenses.  “They set the Debtors’ restructuring efforts back months, imposed millions of dollars in additional, unnecessary fees and costs on these Debtors’ [estates] when bidding was reopened,” Voyager’s filing reads.  In the end, Binance.US was successful in purchasing Voyager’s balance sheet with the deal being approved by a judge in early January.  Voting for the bankruptcy plan is scheduled to end on Feb. 22 with Voyager expected to be back in court on March 2 to continue the case.  Former senior executives of Alameda Research and its affiliate, crypto exchange FTX, have been charged with wire fraud and other crimes by the U.S. Department of Justice.

The centralized fintech company builds global payment products and developed the XRP payment system, which the firm describes as decentralized. While Ripple and XRP are separate entities, Ripple uses XRP and XRP's public blockchain to power its various products.  The payments processor reported transactions of over 106 million on XRP Ledger, the decentralized blockchain, and the creation of 228,000 new and unique user wallets.  Ripple said it has continued to sell XRP only in connection with on-demand liquidity (ODL) transactions, adding the popular product saw continued growth in the last quarter after experiencing its “strongest” year.  “Ripple wrapped up 2022 with its strongest year to date focusing on crypto utility and scaling its ODL product,” Ripple said in its report. “As RippleNet continues to grow, despite a tumultuous market, Ripple experienced the highest amount of demand from both new and existing customers adopting ODL.”  “Ripple’s crypto-powered payment solution is available in nearly 40 payout markets, up from just three markets in 2020,” the firm said.  ODL was launched in 2018 and helps Ripple customers to move money instantly around the world without the need for correspondent banking using XRP – unlike traditional remittance methods which can take days to settle alongside high fees.  Meanwhile, Ripple said that XRP spot markets experienced a general downtrend by way of average daily volumes at roughly $700 million, down from $1.1 billion in Q1 2022. However, it sees investment activity to return to tools that facilitate payments, trading and custody, in the near future.  “While the market will likely remain fragmented, the industry will see investment activity focusing on improving core crypto primitives such as payments, custodial services, [decentralized exchanges] and cross-chain user experiences,” Ripple said.",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | WALLET | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/01/ripple-sold-226m-of-xrp-in-q4-sees-strong-growth-in-on-demand-liquidity-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1caddf23da2a71f453f0536d270b1fb3fd14062c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to CoinGecko, the token has risen 34% in the monthly time frame with gains also being made in the weekly charts. This shows a gradual and steady climb towards its current resistance level. The coin is known for being one of the most reliable cryptos in the market. According to BitPay, the oldest crypto payment platform, although Litecoin has not overtaken Bitcoin as a means of payment, LTC has become a must-have for crypto enthusiasts who want to transition from traditional finance to cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Top 5 GameFi Cryptos To Watch This February Collaboration With Major Companies Litecoin is becoming more ubiquitous as Unbanked and Mastercard teamed up to launch the Litecoin Card. This card will be made available in both Europe and the United Kingdom with the potential to reach over 84% of Europe’s population. This can be a catalyst for widespread adoption of crypto not just in Europe, but in the world. According to Christian Rau, Senior Vice President of Mastercard Europe’s Fintech and Crypto Enablement arm, the initiative comes as a way of giving customers a choice of how they want to pay or be paid with. This isn’t Mastercard’s first foray in the world of crypto and DeFi. On Tuesday, news of Mastercard and Binance’s prepaid crypto card hit the market. This prepaid card, touted the “Binance Card”, would be released in the next few weeks. Considering that Litecoin is now mostly used as a payment method, we might be able to see the coin rise more in fame as a mode of payment. LTC At $97.57 – Is $100 Just Around The Corner? The coin is currently moving upwards steadily, currently trading at $97.57, and up nearly 12% in the last seven days. LTC is currently sitting above its $87 support. The consolidation of this support is expected to help the coin reach $100 or higher. The recent development surrounding Litecoin’s new crypto card is also expected to have an effect on its price as it could drive demand upwards. With this in mind, investors and traders could settle long term comfortably. LTC bulls should also watch the price movement of major cryptocurrencies as this could also have an impact on the coin’s price.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Finishes January up 40% as Crypto Hops Into the Year of the Rabbit  By Sam Reynolds  Happy February.  Bitcoin is at $23,129, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours, while ether is up 1.2% to $1,586.23.  The two largest digital assets by market value wrapped up a monumental January, beating expectations by posting double-digit gains – bitcoin by 40% and ether by 32%.  January also proved to be the season of the altcoins with Cardano's ADA up 56%, dogecoin (DOGE) up 37%, solana (SOL) up 140% and avalanche (AVAX) up 82%.  While most crypto investors are looking to the stock market and U.S. Federal Reserve meeting minutes for guidance, just for a minute we’d like to – for a sense of levity – look to the heavens to see what the stars might tell us.  Most of East Asia has returned to work from celebrating the Lunar New Year. In the Lunar zodiac, 2023 is the year of the rabbit, and legend says this year should be as calm, peaceful and tender as the animal itself.  CLSA, a major brokerage based in Hong Kong, wrote in a note published in January that all macro economic indicators point to this year as being one where the market ""hops"" around.  “Gentle, quick and responsible, the Rabbit is the fourth animal in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese horoscope. Together with yin water, this combination bodes well for a calmer 2023 compared to last year’s tumultuous experience,” the brokerage wrote, while also reminding investors to seek professional advice before making a decision. “This year’s bazi, or destiny chart, advises us to step out of our comfort zone but remain mindful of perils afoot. After all, a rabbit’s foot is lucky for everyone but the fluffy woodland creature.”  Tiger years, of which 2022 was one, are marked by being competitive and unpredictable – and we all know how this went.

What's Next?  By Sam Reynolds  As Ethereum’s Shanghai fork, which will allow for the withdrawal of staked ether, draws closer, Lido DAO, the entity behind the liquid staking token stETH, is preparing a proposal to allow for withdrawals from stETH. While the proposal hasn’t been formerly put before the decentralized autonomous organization for voting, it has found a critic in Galaxy Digital – and its governance token has dropped 15% in the last week despite strong performance from ether.  On the surface, Lido DAO’s proposal for allowing withdrawals from stETH seems routine and follows what’s expected in the Shanghai hard fork. Users will send a withdrawal request to a smart contract called “WithdrawalQueue,” which will reserve the amount of ether required for redemption as well as calculate the redemption rate, then withdrawals will be processed in the order that they are received.  But Galaxy has recently highlighted some issues with the proposal as it stands, that could lead to a few worst-case scenarios.  Within the Ethereum staking economy, slashing is sort of like a sanction against a validator that is accused of breaking the rules. The validator is penalized and either kicked off the Ethereum network or briefly censured. You can think of it as OFAC-by-democracy.  Usually slashing only happens when validators engage in bad technical behavior such as proposing multiple blocks, submitting contradictory votes to proposals, or going offline for an extended period of time. But as CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter highlighted in a recent piece, there was a serious grassroots effort to slash validators such as Coinbase that complied with sanctions to deny Tornado Cash transactions. This isn’t good for institutional adoption.  Galaxy notes that Lido could be the target of a mass-slash event, knocking its validators off the network. If this happens, Lido would enter “bunker mode,” where things are delayed up to 36 days for Lido to recalculate the stETH redemption rate and assess damage to the network. Worse, Galaxy writes, there’s the option for a total halt of withdrawals under what Lido calls the “gate seal smart contract.""  “There are edge case scenarios that change withdrawal dynamics on Lido and highlight unique risks associated with staking through an intermediary,” Galaxy writes, arguing that there are inherent risks with using an intermediary staking service above and beyond the risks that come from Ethereum.  The success of the entire protocol, says Galaxy, relies entirely on the price performance of stETH and the continued availability of liquidity in the stETH:ETH trading pair.  “In the event that Lido validators are penalized or slashed, reducing the amount of total staked ETH in the protocol, users may receive less ETH for their stETH than what they had originally submitted,” Galaxy writes.  Then there’s also the risk of delays.  “The Lido Withdrawal Queue is an additional queue that operates separately from the withdrawals queue and exit queue enforced by the Etheruem protocol,” Galaxy writes. “Therefore, there may be additional delays that users are subject to when withdrawing their staked ETH due to the procedures set by the staking intermediary.”  To be sure, Galaxy isn’t trying to discourage anyone from using an intermediary like Lido. On-chain data shows that using an intermediary is how the vast majority of staking is done: Lido, Coinbase, Kraken and Binance control nearly 50% of this market.  It’s just that there is a new layer of risk introduced, and in this market, it's something of which investors need to be more cognizant.

Silvergate Share Price Rising Following the announcement, Silvergate Bank’s stock prices rose by around 10.8% to session highs of over $13.50. However, the stock is still down over 87% from 2021 peaks. BlackRock reveals that it owns 2,285,197 SI shares, an increase over the past two years. Records showed that BlackRock bought more shares, pushing their stake from 1,144,811 shares, or 6.10%, as of February 2021 to 1,871,537 shares, or 6.30%, in February 2022. Related Reading: U.S. Government Releases Roadmap To Mitigate Crypto Risk For Investors By early last year, top venture capitals, including Vanguard Group Inc, held positions in Silvergate. However, the largest shareholder was PARNX – Parnassus Fund Investor Shares, which had 9,938,796 shares, representing a 31.45% stake in the bank. Per their huge holding, based on February 2022 information, Parnassus appeared to be bullish on crypto’s long-term prospects. Still, parallel data shows that Parnassus’ products with crypto exposure via their Silvergate only represented 2% of their total assets by the close of 2022. Turbulence In Crypto Despite institutions’ confidence in crypto and some of the industry’s infrastructure providers, falling crypto prices and Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) following the collapse of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, heaped pressure on Silvergate Capital. Bitcoin fell from November 2021 highs to less than $20,000 in November 2022. On January 27, Silvergate said it would suspend dividend payments to shareholders to remain liquid. However, it reassured the market that it held more assets than liabilities, explaining that it needed extra cash to navigate the crypto storm. Related Reading: Crypto-Friendly Bank Silvergate Suspends Dividend Payouts This, they add, will allow them to manage expenses, evaluate products, and manage customer relationships. Nonetheless, Alan Lane, CEO of the financial institution, assured the community that it remains bullish on crypto but needed a strong capital position. The bank posted a net loss of $1 billion in Q4 2022, pointing to unfavorable market conditions and fearful investors who withdrew coins from centralized exchanges following the bankruptcy of FTX. To fulfill their obligation, in light of a spike in fund withdrawals, Silvergate sought wholesale funding and sold bonds. In early January, Silvergate laid off 40% of their staff as part of their efforts to reduce expenses and stay afloat amid turbulence in crypto.

Together, retail and wealthy investors are fueling BTC’s rally. The chart below shows that the number of addresses holding Bitcoin has grown significantly over the past month. The number of addresses holding 0.1+ coins, often associated with retail investors, hit an all-time high (ATH) of 4,217,261, according to Glassnode data. The previous all-time high for addresses was reported on January 11, 2023, by Glassnode, with an amount of 4,217,135 addresses holding the flagged currency.

This isn't the first time Astar – which allows developers to build interoperable decentralized applications (dapps) – is collaborating with a large Japanese company. In November, NTT Docomo, Japan's largest mobile phone network, said it will collaborate with Astar Foundation and Accenture to speed up its Web3 adoption.

ASTR, the native token of the network, rose about 50% this year and has a market cap of $234.5 million, according to CoinMarketCap.  Toyota has been experimenting with blockchain technology for a while. In 2020, the auto giant revealed it's exploring blockchain applications for the auto industry through a group composed of several subsidiaries.  Since then the automaker hasn't made any big moves into the technology, despite other corporate giants jumping into non-fungible token projects, crypto payments and metaverse integrations during the hype cycle of 2021 and the beginning of 2022.  Sponsoring the hackathon would mark a more significant step for Toyota's experiment with blockchain technology and potential Web3 integration. ""Toyota is looking to Web3 to support its vision of improving the company's operations, and this online hackathon is an initial step in the process,"" according to the statement.  The move comes as Japan's Web3 policy has been given a jump-start this year by politicians eager to do away with red tape and a customarily slow decision-making process. A Web3 policy office now exists under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). In November, the country's digital ministry announced it would create a DAO to explore Web3 technology.

8582665,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=518115,1675209609,"Data Suggests Sharks Were Behind Litecoin’s 89% Rise To $97, But What About Now?","Litecoin (LTC) has seen one of the highest rallies among the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies, jumping over 89% since the market crash following the FTX collapse. While there are a number of factors that could’ve prompted this news, on-chain data suggests that sharks are the likely culprit. Sharks Holding 100-10,000 Coins Went On A Feeding Frenzy According to a Sentiment report, the sharks may be the ones behind the upward rally that Litecoin has embarked on in the last two months. It shows that these shark addresses holding between 100-10,000 LTC on their accounts went on a massive accumulation trend that saw them add a reasonable portion of supply to their holdings.

This works out to around a 4.92% increase in their holdings and 0.5% of the total LTC supply. As the image below shows, there was a significant uptick around this point coinciding with the increase in the price of the digital asset. LTC sharks accumulate in two months | Source: Santiment The accumulation trend continued into January 2023 when LTC’s price movement had ramped up. Thus, this shows that while accumulation by sharks may not have been the main driver of the price rally, they may have played a significant role. Further movements point toward these shark addresses having an effect on the price. Like the chart shows, there has been some profit-taking after LTC hit its local peak of $97 and this profit-taking coincided with the price of the cryptocurrency falling back down to the $94 level. Will Litecoin Continue To Rally From Here? Despite the sharks taking profit on their Litecoin buys over the last two months, the bull case for LTC is still not destroyed. The chart shows that even these large investors are still holding on to a good portion of the coins accumulated over the last two months. As long as there is still a large gap between what was accumulated and what is being sold, the price of LTC can be expected to hold up. It is also important to note that 2023 is an important year for Litecoin. A lot of the bullish sentiment around it has originated from the expectations surrounding the Litecoin halving. Litecoin, which works similarly to bitcoin, is about to reduce its block reward once more, reducing the number of coins going into circulation, and triggering FOMO (fear of missing out).

But already, positive sentiment is already ramping up, contributing to the price increase that the coin has recorded.

This suggests that despite the market drawdown, the LTC price is likely to hold at the $90 support.
