42376659,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbwD,1383932713,"Bitcoin price could be highway robbery, PayPal's quandary, and how to stop a nasty rumour","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 8th November 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  Supply and demand – with menaces  Bitcoin's price keeps going up, and nobody knows quite why. The Chinese are still in the frame, just because, as are a string of strong stories on investment in, reliance on and general official warming to, the cryptocurrency.  And of course, there's the ever-present chance that it's a bubble about to burst. You can find all opinions available out there. Pick your favourite.  But there could be another reason, and it's rather sinister. You may have heard of a piece of malware called CryptoLocker – a nasty piece of work that, once it gains access to your computer, promptly encrypts all your documents and pictures and then issues a demand: Send money to get a key, or your files will be deleted.  That's been around for a while, but over the past week the number of reported infections has increased enormously, to the point that email disinfecting companies say it's the most prevalent malware of the moment.  John Law can confirm this, as he knows victims and has tales of hundreds more.  There are also tales of stores running out of MoneyPak prepaid cards – one of the two methods that the CryptoLocker criminals demand payment with. The other, of course, is bitcoin.  Quite a lot of bitcoin, as it happens. You get to pay two BTC if you want to recover your file within 72 hours, or 10 BTC afterwards. (The official advice from security bods is – don't pay, recover your files from your backups. You have got backups, right?)  Nobody knows how many people have been infected by CryptoLocker, nor how many have paid up. But there are millions of infected emails out there; it's a major attack – and at two BTC per hit, that's pretty good payback for the bad guys.  They're being quite careful, too, with every ransom going to a different bitcoin address, and running their main servers out of the Ukraine and on the Tor network.  Is this one of the factors driving the bitcoin price up? Well, with well over 200,000 bitcoins traded per day at the moment – a very large increase on a week ago – it's certainly feasible that a good chunk of those is panicked hostage traffic.  And Mt. Gox, which had just lost its crown as top exchange to BTC China, has roared back into the lead – as you might expect for an exchange with multiple currencies, if lots of people from around the world suddenly needed bitcoin in a hurry. Nasty.  John Law recommends you spend fifty quid on an external hard disk instead, and make some backups. It's much cheaper, and you should be doing it anyway. And for heaven's sake, don't click on any links in emails you weren't expecting. And if you can, run anything but Windows.  Are we going to see more of this sort of thing? Yes. There has been ransomware before, but it was never easy to send the money anonymously and securely.  Now it is, and every bad hacker on the planet can see how to do it. The good news is, if you have a secure computer and don't do silly things with it, you'll be safe: the bad news is, most people don't and do.  Don't be most people.  PayPal clams up, and plays the game  You're the boss of an organisation that makes its money by moving other people's money around; in this case, by having a system to send dosh through email.  What do you do when someone invents another system that not only does that, but does it much cheaper and more flexibly? And which you can't buy out or shut down?  You could try asking John Donahoe, who runs eBay, which owns PayPal. The Financial Times did. Answer: “We're watching it.”  Which is roughly what you'd get if you asked the CIA what they thought of the KGB: an answer that was utterly true and utterly useless, at least as far as finding out what you wanted to know. So, let's see if a bit of logic can do better.  If bitcoin is widely adopted and people get used to spending it directly with people they don't know, then why go through PayPal?  All those fees, all that hassle. If eBay refuses to allow bitcoin for auction payments, which would win? Ebay is lovely, but probably not bigger than a global currency. Worst case – could happen.  Best case – from PayPal's point of view – is if bitcoin just goes away quietly. Which isn't going to happen, but it might end up as just too weird for ordinary people. At which point, someone will have another go at digital currency and get it right. Best case, in the end, isn't going to happen.  So yeah, you bet he's watching it.  Given that bitcoin or something like it has a good chance of disrupting PayPal, what's the best option for it?  Well, PayPal isn't just a rent-collecting money transfer agent: it adds layers of consumer protection, which despite the bad press when it messes things up, it takes very seriously.  If you get ripped off on a PayPal mediated transaction, you've got a very good chance of getting squared away.  [post-quote]  People who abuse PayPal find themselves off the system. Can PayPal do that if it accepts bitcoin?  Well, possibly: depends how much it thinks the market is prepared to pay for it (you don't get to choose your PayPal charges, but bitcoin services will be a very competitive market).  How about the other ways people make money from money? There are currency transactions – PayPal already does those, and not because they make it feel warm and fuzzy. People want to do those with bitcoin.  And then there's all that other stuff that people want to do with bitcoin – merchant services, safe deposit boxes, easy to use walletry – which upstarts like Circle are very publicly going for.  There's no reason, once bitcoin is on firmer regulatory ground, that PayPal couldn't do some or all of that, and help keep lots of transaction profit in-house for its eBay masters while providing useful amounts of profits on top. It'd be a good brand to do it, too.  Which means we know now what 'watching it' means. It means having a number of strategies ready to go – sets of homegrown services, buying someone like Circle, a strong message – to keep its business and even encouraging newbies in, the moment the stars are aligned.  Goodness only knows what conversations are going on between PayPal and the banks, all of whom will also be doing something similar (if they're sane, which they may not be), because you can't just throw that switch without them on board, but that the conversations are happening? Does John Law like claret?  Watch it.  If it's not broken, don't write about it  Brace yourself for a week of 'Isn't bitcoin broken?' questions from the less well-informed of your friends.  The problem is papers – first, the technical paper that claimed in a screaming heading that “Bitcoin Is Vulnerable!'. Which, because it came from a respectable pair of researchers at Cornell, was picked up by the mainstream press – such as the Daily Telegraph – who were happy to report on the paper's claims.  It turns out bitcoin isn't broken, and doesn't need fixing. Indeed, if you read down the paper a bit you'll find as much admitted.  John Law doesn't propose to go into the technical side of the arguments – basically, if more than a third of miners get together, they can get something of an advantage in mining – but will point out that it's long been known that if 50 percent of miners get together they can do much the same and, oddly, nobody has.  Something to do with not actually wanting to damage the cryptocurrency they're spending all that time and effort on, probably. Or the limited extra returns. Or the fact it doesn't actually affect bitcoin trading, just mining, and mining is pretty high-risk anyway. There are plenty of technical reasons why it's not a problem, too.  The trouble is, although there are now plenty of cogent refutations out there a couple of days after the original paper came out, you won't see 'Bitcoin safe after all, due to complex social and technical issues' in the Daily Telegraph.  Not because the writers can't hack complex stuff, but really, there's the Twitter IPO. There's the bitcoin price hike! There's Silk Road 2.0!  “Something you didn't understand about something else you didn't understand not quite what it seemed, for reasons you won't understand” is, to be fair, a hard one to get past the editor.  And so, Daily Telegraph readers who aren't up for following technical discussions online – insert cheap but accurate dig about ageing demographics here. I SAID, INSER... oh, never mind. Get your butler to explain it to you – otherwise you will carry around a vague feeling that this bitcoin thingy, well, it's a bit shaky.  There is nothing to be done about this, except to recommend a good website with all the latest cybercurrency news and, of course, a dogged commitment to following a story through.  John Law is sure you'll think of something.  John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude.

42376647,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbh7,1383926078,US man arrested for selling guns on Black Market Reloaded,"To anyone feeling emboldened by the proliferation of online black marketplaces in the wake of Silk Road’s demise, take heed: a US man has been arrested for selling guns on the Tor-based site Black Market Reloaded.  As well as charges for selling firearms without a license, Matthew Crisafi, 38, of New Hampshire, is also being prosecuted for conspiracy to commit money laundering and smuggling goods from the United States.  After a hearing in New Hampshire he will be extradited to New Jersey to face the charges in that state.  Like illegal goods and services marketplace Silk Road, Black Market Reloaded also uses bitcoin as its sole means of transacting.  The rival site opened in April 2013, and almost immediately came under Department of Homeland Security investigation. It is still open for business.  Prosecutors allege Crisafi used regular US Mail services to ship a variety of firearms over a three-month period on Black Market Reloaded, including an AR-15 Bushmaster assault rifle to an undercover agent. Some of the weapons were mailed to New Jersey, in violation of that state’s laws.  Reuters  quoted Andrew McLees as the Homeland Security Investigations agent who led the case:  “People who think they can hide behind a veil of an 'underground' website to buy and sell weapons illegally are mistaken... HSI will use all of our collective resources to track you down and bring you to justice.""  Black Market Reloaded has so far been the most popular successor to Silk Road, which was shut down in early October 2013 and its alleged founder/administrator arrested.  One month later, a site almost identical to the original Silk Road went online on Tor with a front page mocking federal justice authorities’ efforts. It claims to be far more secure than its predecessor.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/08/us-man-arrested-for-selling-guns-on-black-market-reloaded,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/974e051c652fa99f5ea83b790909642929bc223d-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376655,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbpv,1383919202,"Around the world in 100 days with bitcoin: anything is possible, but nothing is easy","How far have we come with bitcoin? Where can you spend it? What’s the situation on the ground today?  If there is anyone qualified to answer those questions, it might be Austin Craig, who has just spent 100 days abstaining from traditional currency and devoting himself to using only bitcoin.  He and Beccy Bingham-Craig, who were recently married, set out on a unique adventure that took them across three continents in pursuit of businesses that would accept bitcoin. They called it, "" Life on Bitcoinhttp://lifeonbitcoin.com/"".  “The goal was to see what was possible with bitcoin,” says Austin on Skype from Provo, Utah, where he and Beccy live.  His conclusion? Anything is possible, but nothing is easy… Yet.  “Even the simplest things proved to be a challenge,” he says.  During their experiment, they travelled across the US before flying to Stockholm, Berlin and Singapore.  What the couple found is both dispiriting and hugely exciting. Bitcoiners abound, but the businesses set up to take their money are still few and far between.  “Everything you want is in New York city,” says Austin, as an example. “But bitcoin-accepting businesses are still pretty scarce.”  In other words, the field is wide open.  Along the way they used a combination of charm, ingenuity and the help of a few businesses that could enable some of the trickier challenges they faced.  Bulgaria-based travel company Simply Travel accepts bitcoin and organised their hotels and flights, for example.  The couple had to educate people about bitcoin, so that they could pay them – the fact that they could email people money using Coinbase helped that process.  But despite a rapidly spreading awareness about the currency, more needs to be done to encourage uptake, says Austin:  “If we want people to start using this, if my parents are going to use this some day, we’re not just going to have to give them directions, we’re going to have to build the road, pave it, put up welcome signs and line the place with shops.”  As well as being a personal journey, the couple set out to make a documentary called “Life on Bitcoin”, raising just over $70,000 (£43,500) on Kickstarter.  They have accumulated over 200 hours of footage so far. When the production team have finished processing that footage, there will be more filming, interviews and exploration beyond what Austin and Beccy directly experienced.  “We want this to be a documentary that covers bitcoin as a global movement,” says Austin. “We want this to be the story of bitcoin.”  He describes the documentary as a “Trojan horse” – it is ostensibly about the adventures of a newly-wedded couple from Utah, but really at it’s heart an exploration of a new phenomenon that promises to shape the 21 century.  [post-quote]  Back in Utah, Austin says it’s a “relief” to be using regular currency again. Living solely on bitcoin, “things became a lot more difficult, challenging, complicated”.  “I’m not sure what we did could have been done any sooner than when we did it,” he says. “If we tried it a year ago I’m not sure it would have been possible.”  Despite the difficulties, travelling with bitcoin on the brain gave the couple a unique experience of the places they visited.  “We couldn’t partake of the average tourist locations,” says Austin. “We had to go where the [bitcoin] community was.”  What’s more, despite having to give their landlord a 10 percent premium on their rent to persuade him to take bitcoin, they probably spent less than if they had done the same journey on regular currency – they just had fewer opportunities to spend money.  Hopefully in future, travelling the world on bitcoin will be as mundane as travelling the world with traveller’s cheques, except as Austin and Beccy found, we won’t have to change our money.  “Maybe our kids will watch the documentary and be like ‘so what was the deal, you were living on money, what was challenging about that?’”  Feature image: Life On Bitcoin",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/08/around-the-world-in-100-days-with-bitcoin-anything-is-possible-but-nothing-is-easy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/106f3cb6c1251c9f3add77f4031af3b2db56cf0a-960x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376651,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbof,1383914259,Australian company announces bitcoin scholarship contest,"An Australian company has launched a 'bitcoin-based scholarship' with an initial essay competition to answer the question: ""Digital currencies and the future: will bitcoin change the world?""  Sydney-based Bit Trade Australia, a bitcoin buy and sell business (similar to Coinbase but for Australian users), is sponsoring the contest, billed as ""Australia’s First Digital Currency Academic Scholarship-Competition"".  The prizes, while not enough to put anyone through university at November 2013 bitcoin prices, are adequate to spur their winners' further engagement with the bitcoin world: 7 BTC for the first prize (or a minimum of AU $1,000 equivalent should bitcoin's value plummet), 3 BTC for the second prize and 2 BTC for third.  Entrants must be based in Australia or New Zealand, and should submit essays of 1,500-2,000 words. Entries opened on 1 November 2013 and will close on 31 January 2014.  ""We’re incredibly excited to be able to facilitate education and knowledge sharing around bitcoin,"" said Ronald Tucker, Bit Trade Australia's Head of Marketing.  ""The idea for the essay competition came out of our desire to raise awareness around the security of bitcoin versus traditional payment methods such as credit card transactions and cash. As more businesses adopt bitcoin in Australia we’re excited to share people’s thoughts and insight into how this will impact the Australian economy.""  Tucker said the initial idea to hold a contest came from Hugo O'Connor, Bit Trade Australia's Markets and Exchanges Analyst and local bitcoin evangelist.  O'Connor also runs Joostice, a local juice bar and one of the only physical venues in Sydney known to accept bitcoin (along with bitcoin meetup venue The Old Fitzroy Pub).  Bit Trade Australia has been around since April 2013, and claims to place emphasis on ease of use, speed, and transparency.  It sells bitcoins to customers via over-the-counter bank deposits made at major Australian banks, and aims to be low-cost with commissions of 4.9% to buy and 2.9% to sell (based on a weighted average of the three largest bitcoin exchanges).  Its current base team of five is set to double soon as it moves further afield into bitcoin microloans, bitcoin accounting tools and new operations in New Zealand and Canada.  The company is also a founding member of the 'Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association', Australia's first digital currency chamber of commerce, and will work with the recently-formed Australian Bitcoin Foundation chapter.  The essay competition is aimed at university students of economic, finance, computer and even philosophy disciplines, but is also open to bloggers, tech writers or anyone else with an interest in bitcoin.  A panel of bitcoin experts will judge the contest. They include Max Kaye, founding member of the Australian Bitcoin Association, Professor Dick Bryan from the University of Sydney Economics department (and author of Capitalism With Derivatives: A Political Economy of Financial Derivatives, Capital and Class). A third judge from the media world will be confirmed soon.

42376649,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbkt,1383906930,Judge orders bitcoin incubator CoinLab to hand over $2.4 Million in bitcoins,"Some more bad news for startup incubator CoinLab: it’s been ordered by a judge to pay up - in bitcoin - to Bitvestment Partners LLC, who sued them just last week for breach of contract.  Bitvestment  claimed CoinLab ""wasn’t living up to its obligation to provide 8,000 bitcoins"" under an arrangement the two firms made in August.  In ordering CoinLab to pay the contracted amount, Judge Robert W. Sweet of the US district court for the southern district of New York also blocked them from providing bitcoins to any other parties until it meets its obligations.  As well as the 8,000 BTC (approximately $2.4 million at today's Bitcoin Price Index), Bitvestment also sought access to CoinLab’s financial data, but the judgment denied this part of the claim.  Bitvestment’s website describes the firm as “involved in bitcoin mining, bitcoin-related e-commerce, and innovative uses of block chain-based algorithms,” and using its “expertise to evaluate bitcoin business and related investment opportunities.”  According to CoinLab’s CEO Peter Vessenes, the lawsuit was a contributing factor in the bankruptcy two days ago of Alydian Inc, a company that featured prominently on CoinLab’s portfolio site and also functioned as CoinLab’s bitcoin mining arm.  Alydian, which also offered its mining services to other parties without their own equipment, went under with a reported $3.6 million in debts.  CoinLab had also been funded to the tune of $500,000 by Silicon Valley venture capitalists. The company says it does not mine any bitcoin itself, however, and has not indicated whether Alydian is still on mining duty post-bankruptcy.  Peter Vessenes also happens to be the chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, the nonprofit that acts as bitcoin’s mouthpiece and promotes its use.  via Wall Street Journal",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/08/judge-orders-bitcoin-incubator-coinlab-to-hand-over-24-million-in-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/26d9504b468c1765ffcb6ab7a3ff9c29d5ae0ea7-1000x708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
