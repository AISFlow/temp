42382665,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sbXB,1568841009,"DOJ Brings Extortion Charges Against Early Advisor to Ethereum, tZero","UPDATE (Sept. 19, 2019, 05:15 UTC): A spokesperson for Casper Labs said Steven Nerayoff is no longer a member of its team, saying:  ""We were unaware of the reported arrest and charges against Mr. Nerayoff until we read the news article ourselves. Mr. Nerayoff no longer holds any positions with CasperLabs.""      U.S. law enforcement has charged Steven Nerayoff, an early supporter of the ethereum project and a former paid advisor to Overstock’s tZero, with extortion.  Nerayoff, an attorney and founder of blockchain consulting firm Alchemist, was arrested Wednesday morning by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and was scheduled to face charges before a federal court in Brooklyn in the afternoon. The FBI also arrested Michael Hlady, an Alchemist associate.  Nerayoff and Hlady face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of the alleged scheme, described as “an old-fashioned shakedown” by the United States Attorney Office’s for the Eastern District of New York (part of the Department of Justice) and “an age-old extortion scheme ... with a modern-day twist” by the FBI.  Nerayoff's attorney, Avi Moskowitz, told CoinDesk that ""a civil dispute has been improperly distorted into a criminal matter. Mr. Neryaoff looks forward to the truth coming out and clearing his name.""  According to the government’s complaint, Nerayoff's firm was tapped to advise an undisclosed, Seattle-based startup — dubbed ""Company 1"" in court documents – in July 2017. Nerayoff began demanding larger than contractually agreed-upon ethereum payouts for his help with the company’s initial coin offering (ICO) that coming fall, the complaint says,  Per the agreement, Nerayoff was entitled to 22.5 percent of all the cryptocurrency tokens sold during the ICO as well as 22.5 percent of all the funds raised by Company 1 “regardless of the method and manner in which [the funds] are raised.”  Before the ICO occurred, Nerayoff demanded higher compensation from Company 1 executives, identified as John and Jane Doe. Through an email sent to the company’s executives, Nerayoff demanded 30,000 ETH if the pre-sale and crowd sale surpassed 60,000 ETH in addition to a large allotment of the Company 1’s ICO token, the complaint says.  If not, Nerayoff promised to “sabotage the crowd sale, generate negative press for Company 1 and use his contacts with influential people to ‘destroy’ Company 1,” the DOJ alleged.  Company 1 agreed to the payout despite not receiving additional compensating services, the complaint says.  'Operations guy'  The ICO raised 55,677 ETH during the pre-sale of the token. A crowd sale the following two months raised an additional 20,000 ETH, totaling 75,677 ETH raised, worth about $32 million at the time. Of the 75,766 ETH raised, Nerayoff received 30,000.  The following March, Nerayoff demanded a 10,000 ETH “loan” from Company 1 worth $4.45 million at the time, the complaint says. Nerayoff also introduced Company 1 to Hlady, his “operations guy.”  According to court documents, “Nerayoff claimed Hlady was a former government agent who could carry firearms through airports. On separate occasions, Hlady told Jane Doe ... that he had been shot at and had killed people, that he had 'taken down' a head of state, and that he had been a part of the Irish Republican Army, the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and the FBI.”  That same month, Jane Doe visited Nerayoff at his New York home and stayed the night. During the evening, Hlady entered her guest room, where she was sleeping by herself. Turning on the light and pulling a chair up to her bed, Hlady demanded the 10,000 ETH loan or they would “crush” her company, and Nerayoff later entered the room and made a similar threat, according to the complaint.  Nerayoff and Hlady continued to threaten Jane Doe through iMessages and personal threats thereafter, including telling her where her child attended school.  Jane Doe instructed a Company 1 employee to pay the 10,000 ETH loan to Nerayoff between March 28 and April 1, 2018. The loan was never repaid by Nerayoff, according to the U.S. attorney.  Roles in ethereum, tZero  Nerayoff was on the board of advisors of tZERO, Overstock's security token trading platform, as of March 1, 2018, according to a securities filing. An Overstock press release from 2017 described him as “architect of the Ethereum ICO.”  Similar language has been used to describe his involvement with the early ethereum team. For example, his bio on the TechStars accelerator's website states,  “Steven's innovative work as the legal architect of Ethereum's record setting token sale continues to be the basic structure used throughout the world today. Steven innovated the concept of 'utility,' specifically using the concept of 'gas' or 'fuel' for legal purposes.""  People who worked on ethereum during its early days told CoinDesk he was indeed involved, though those descriptions may be somewhat exaggerated.  For example, Nerayoff guaranteed payment on about $200,000 of legal bills for an opinion letter the team obtained from a law firm for the 2014 token sale, according to one source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  He was also involved in the ideation of gas, but far from the driving force suggested by his bio, two people who worked on the early ethereum team said.  A tZero spokesperson told CoinDesk that the company “has no affiliation with Steven and his company, Alchemist. In the past, Alchemist was a paid advisor to tZERO for its [security token offering]. tZERO has since terminated the advisory relationship.""  Nerayoff is also the co-founder of Casper Labs, according to a February 2019 blog post by the company, which is researching the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that the ethereum network is expected to shift to in the future. However, his name was missing from the company's team page as of Wednesday evening. A message to the startup was not immediately returned.

GK8's technology removes many of the dangers internet-accessible crypto wallets face – hacks, attacks, unexplained losses — while preserving their more convenient features, such as sending and receiving digital assets.  In an interview, GK8's co-founder Lior Lamesh told CoinDesk that a ""unidirectional connection"" links its wallet directly to the blockchain, where it transfers assets as conventional wallets do. GK8's one-way signaling does not itself operate on the internet.  GK8 says its techniques “bypass core assumptions related to cryptocurrency transfers and eliminate attack vectors to any asset transfer.”  Several cryptography experts are among GK8 board members, including Prof. Eran Tromer, one of security token Zcash’s founding scientists.  [embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz9rIW1zmG8[/embed]  In a video, Tromer said:  ""GK8's cold wallet solution improves on the state-of-the-art by having essentially unidirectional communication from the wallet to the outside and never accepting raw information from the outside back into the cold wallet.""  ""This minimizes the attack surface and prevents attacks,"" he said.  GK8 secured five patents for its innovations, according to the announcement. A patent abstract associated with Lamesh described the technology as follows:  “The digital wallet device is electronically disconnected from other digital devices and comprising: a cryptocurrency integrated circuit (IC) that is isolated from any computer interface"" … “and a unidirectional communication hardware for sending said transaction to a communication device for broadcasting said transaction via a network.”  The founders are veterans of Israeli cybersecurity, according to Lamesh. Both served as cybersecurity experts to the prime minister before founding GK8 in 2018.  Lamesh said that he and co-founder Shahar Shamai began working on GK8's cold wallet after finding security vulnerabilities in ""state-of-the-art"" wallets. They were both bothered by the risks of storing assets online.  ""We tried to think: how can we make a fully operational cold wallet with no internet connection at all. And we ended up doing exactly that,"" Lamesh said.  He said that GK8 seeks to become the cold wallet of choice for institutional investors.

The complaint itself specifies  that, ""ICOBox and Evdokimov told investors that the offering proceeds would be used to cover the cost of providing ICOBox’s planned services to digital asset startups that could not afford them,"" adding:  ""Defendants claimed that ICOBox would be successful — and the ICOS tokens valuable — due to the efforts of ICOBox’s management team, who would curate potential digital asset projects and attract '100+' clients per month. As of the date of ICOBox’s offering, ICOBox had yet to support a single token sale to completion.""  In addition to the sale itself, ICOBox facilitated the sale of another $650 million in token sale for ""dozens of clients"" through its platform, thereby acting as an unregistered broker, Wednesday's release said.  The agency is looking for Evdokimov and ICOBox to refund investors with interest, pay civil money penalties and suffer injunctive relief.  In a statement, SEC Los Angeles Regional Office director Michele Wein Layne said, ""by ignoring the registration requirements of the federal securities laws, ICOBox and Evdokimov exposed investors to investments, which are now virtually worthless, without providing information that is critical to making informed investment decisions.""

42382672,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sbfz,1568834817,New Bitcoin Mutual Fund Eases Crypto for Wary Asian Investors,"Hong Kong-based venture capital group CMCC Global launched its Liberty Bitcoin Fund to provide crypto currency access to accredited investors in Asia who are very interested but have been slow to buy the coins directly.  The Liberty Bitcoin Fund is a single-asset passive tracker of Bitcoin and offers services including buying and safekeeping coins.  “We have received more and more questions over the years from our existing investor base about whether we could help them buy Bitcoin,” Martin Baumann, managing partner of CMCC Global, told CoinDesk. “The new fund is really a demand-driven.”  CMCC Global has set up three funds since 2016. All of the funds are focused on investments in proprietary technical infrastructure such as ethereum network where developers can build applications.  The funds have raised more funding from high net worth individuals, family offices assets and institutional investors over time. The first fund in the CMCC Liquid VC series gathered $1 million while the other two successors received $3.5 million and $30 million.  Baumann said the anchor investor for the third fund is one of the largest family offices in Asia, while declining to reveal the identity of the investor due to privacy and regulatory requirements.  Japanese messaging app Line also invested in the third fund, Baumann added.  The latest fund uses ANXONE Custody, a proprietary digital asset safekeeping system with insured wallets provided by custodian BC Group, a digital asset technology company publicly listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  Growing Demand for Digital Asset Class  There is rising demand for cryptocurrencies as an asset class for traditional funds, industry pros said.  “As digital assets mature and gain recognition, such as being included in mutual funds and ETFs, this volatility should slowly subside, making it a more appropriate investment in multi-asset portfolios,” Kostya Etus, portfolio manager at CLS Investments, a money management firm, told CoinDesk.  As digital assets grow to be perceived as a legitimate investment in portfolios, mutual funds have become one of the most accessible ways to own crypto.  “Investors who prefer not to open accounts specifically for digital assets would be able to purchase mutual funds within their standard brokerage accounts and maintain all of their assets in one place.” Etus said.  While cryptocurrencies might not be as stable as traditional asset classes including fixed income and equity, Etus pointed out their price movements tend to be non-correlated with other asset classes, increasing the diversification benefit of adding crypto to already diversified portfolios.  Despite the benefits, volatility in digital assets such as Bitcoin is very high, sometimes moving more in one day than some asset classes do in years, Etus said. “This extreme volatility may be dangerous and detrimental to portfolio returns.”  In addition, the Asia Pacific region remains one of the most deep pocketed area, with investors eager to invest across asset classes.  According to a PwC report in January, assets under management in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to grow from $15.1 trillion in 2017 to $16.9 trillion in 2020, and then nearly double to $29.6 trillion by 2025, a total compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7%.  Limited Access in Asia  Crypto investment in Asia is less common than you’d think.  “If you are a billionaire in Hong Kong or anywhere in the world, you don't get a ledger and tell your analyst to buy some Bitcoin for you, and then he runs away with it. That's just doesn't work,” Baumann said.  CMCC is launching its Liberty Bitcoin Fund with the ambition to provide digital asset management services in Asia to be on par with Grayscale in the U.S., Baumann said.  “Investors needed a regulated outfit in which they could invest, something like Grayscale in New York,” Baumann said. “What we're doing here is a similar story.”  When the company started to invest in digital assets in 2016, it had a hard time to find basic services such as auditing and fund administration, which would have been easy for an equity or a fixed income fund.  “These things did not exist. If you approached a fund administrator, they would not work with you because they wouldn't work with digital asset companies or crypto companies,” Baumann said. “Or if you approached the bank, you're having a hard time getting a bank card.”  “You need auditors, you need a licensed fund administrator, you need to have professional care.” he said. “We need an anti-money laundering people, and amongst others you need to have a professional custodian.”  Lion via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/18/new-bitcoin-mutual-fund-eases-crypto-for-wary-asian-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf65b872a0e6b08e5e5187030a3db3873a0ace62-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382669,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sbax,1568826716,Litecoin Non-Profit to Hold Undisclosed Treasury Sum with Crypto Lender,"The Litecoin Foundation is putting its capital to work, lending at interest through another cryptocurrency program.  The Foundation has tapped the Celsius Network, a blockchain-based crypto lending program, to become its preferred crypto wallet, Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky told CoinDesk.  As part of the deal, the Foundation will allocate an undisclosed portion of its treasury to the Network. LTC holders can receive up to 10.53% annually back on their crypto holdings and dollar loans as low as 4.95 percent as well.  Mashinsky said the endorsement by the Foundation validates the platform, which claims to give back up to 80 percent of its revenue to depositors.  ""Litecoin being the first foundation to work with us and endorse us is a real milestone. It’s a huge event,"" Mashinsky said. ""That’s the first time I can say that the general community is recognizing Celsius for the utility it provides.""  Raising $50 million in a 2018 initial coin offering, Celsius has completed over $2 billion in loans in 2019, held $350 million annually in customer deposits, and issued over $3.5 million in interest.  Crypto custodian BitGo told CoinDesk they held some $1 billion in Celsius-based crypto deposits this past year, almost double the amount locked away in decentralized finance protocols according to DeFi Pulse.  The primary non-profit tasked to maintain the cryptocurrencies codebase, the Foundation has been actively seeking partnerships this past year. Notable additions have included the Miami Dolphins, and now, the Celsius Network.  The Foundation's financials came under scrutiny last quarter following disclosures concerning employee pay during Q1. Litecoin creator and Foundation managing director Charlie Lee told CoinDesk at the time he would continue to fund the Foundation until financially stable.  Lee told CoinDesk the interest-bearing deposits were the onus for signing up with Celsius, particularly for LTC holders.  ""We’ve chosen Celsius as the LF’s preferred interest bearing wallet as we are always interested in helping LTC holders take advantage of new use cases for their holdings. What better way to show our confidence in the product than by allocating a portion of the LF’s treasury.""    Lee told CoinDesk the Foundation has no plans for taking out loans on collateral, a product Celsius offers.    ""At this time, we have no immediate lending or borrowing plans,"" Lee said at the time. ""As our relationship with Celsius evolves we are certainly open to exploring new opportunities.""

42382680,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sbmH,1568822412,Binance Is Pitching Its Stablecoin as a Government-Friendly Libra Competitor,"Crypto exchange Binance is now explicitly positioning its Venus stablecoin project as a government-friendly alternative to Facebook's Libra, just a month after downplaying any suggestions of rivalry between the two.  Last month, when Binance launched the initiative to develop localized stablecoins and digital assets pegged to fiat currencies across the globe, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (“CZ”) said that if anything, “this should help Libra, if you think about it.”    Pushing adoption, yes. Domination, no. Always happy to co-exist.        In fact, this should help Libra, if you think about it. Will leave it at that. https://t.co/HLSywLb2mi    — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) August 19, 2019      However, Binance’s stance toward Libra seems to have hardened.  Speaking to CoinDesk last week during the OECD Global Blockchain Policy Forum, Samuel Lim, Binance's chief compliance officer, said of Venus:  “You could say it's a response to Libra, or you could say it's an alternative to libra. I would say it is like a strong competitor to Libra.”  Lim said he and his team have been holding conversations with central banks and regulators in developing countries, who he said are concerned that if Libra launches they could lose sovereign authority over their currencies overnight. The risk to sovereignty is particularly acute if there are problems with inflation and the people opt for Libra instead.  “That is basically the message we are sending today,” Lim added. “You have the power. We are not taking any power away from you, which is different from Libra.”  Governments of developing countries are “definitely worried” about Libra, he said. “Some might be saying ‘let’s try it out’, but there are others saying, ‘there’s no way in hell I will let Libra in my economy.' Of course, the developed countries have the power to block it. But developing countries don’t have the financial power to say I'm going to block such a powerful corporation.”  Binance has already made inroads in Africa, where it has an exchange hub up and running in Uganda. But Lim said it would be inappropriate to name which ones it’s talking to about Venus at this time.  “I can say this, in the next three to six months we are moving heavily towards partnerships with governments, central banks, and large corporates,” he said.  Unlike Libra, Venus ensures control over any proposed stablecoin stays with the government issuing it; they decide how to collateralize the coins and how many to mint, said Lim.  As such, the central bank in question decides how much currency reserves to hold in their vaults to back the coins; Binance is a technology provider, offering its Bianance Chain to create the coins, much as ethereum serves as a platform for all manner of ERC-20 tokens.  When asked for further comment, Facebook directed CoinDesk to testimony given by the company in July.  Hello Venus  Binance’s refined sales pitch for Venus comes on the eve of the exchange's expansion into the U.S. (Binance US is set to begin taking deposits Wednesday) and capitalizes on concerns about Libra raised by governments of major economies.  “The monetary sovereignty of states is under threat,” French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said last week, vowing to block Libra from launching in Europe.  David Marcus, the CEO of Facebook’s Calibra subsidiary, rebutted such claims Monday, arguing that since Libra would be backed by a basket of fiat currencies, it wouldn’t be usurping central banks’ power to create money.  In addition to Venus bringing developing-world central bankers “options like they never had before,” Lim said it will create a bridge to the unbanked who have mobile technology and give smaller countries “the opportunity to break into the global market through cryptos as they are now plugged into a global liquidity pool provided by Binance.""  He predicted that once multiple instances of this play out, traditional FX markets would be replicated on the blockchain. Ultimately, Venus would enable “global access, instant liquidity and the ability to experiment with new financial instruments (in a controlled environment like a sandbox/testbed) might provide very attractive for some governments/countries.”  In a parting swipe at Libra, Lim touted the strength of the Binance brand and its standing in the crypto-sphere, concluding:  “We know what we are doing. It's not like Facebook saying they are just going to put together a blockchain team. We have been in this business from day one; CZ has been doing this for more than ten years.”  (To be precise, Zhao has been involved in crypto since 2013, and in financial technology broadly since at least the mid-2000s.)

A blockchain-based answer to the gig-economy’s rise, Opolis is a professional employment organization (PEO) that, in part, plans to facilitate seamless cross-border payments with Dai.  “Opolis is offering the best solution we've seen yet that can provide the security and benefits usually restricted to traditional workplaces,” Head of Community Development for MakerDAO Richard Brown said in a statement announcing the partnership. “Maker is looking forward to seeing how Dai can help de-risk this emerging workforce,” Brown said.  In an interview with CoinDesk, John Paller, Opolis founder, explained how the broader efficiency gains are also supported by lower transaction costs for gig workers who work across borders.  “We’re partnering up to create a more streamlined system for [international] payroll remittance,” Paller said. “This would eliminate lots of different burdens and wait times and expensive fees in the traditional banking system.”  Guild members will use the stablecoin to stake their membership, unlock heath insurance, pay into retirement plans and automate tax compliance, among other benefits. They may choose to receive payment in Dai or in fiat.  MakerDAO’s grant supports the company’s plan to build a Decentralized Employment Organization (DEO), a web of employment services targeted at non-traditional employees.  Opolis caters to full-time workers whose gig-style employment lacks conventional health and insurance benefit packages. Ride-share drivers, freelance writers and graphic designers seldom receive health care through their contracted employers, but can pay into Opolis to unlock those same benefits, for example.  “What we’re really doing is democratizing and creating sustainable benevolence in these ecosystems,” Paller said.“The goal is to become an infrastructure service utility that average people use.”  Guild membership applications will open on Nov. 1, Opolis announced today.

42382664,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sbUf,1568816871,Germany Passes National Policy to Explore Blockchain But Limit Stablecoins,"Germany's government has passed a new strategy outlining the ways the leading EU state is planning to use blockchains.  Approved by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet on Wednesday, the strategy sets the government’s priorities in the blockchain space, such as the digital identity, securities and corporate finance. It also sets out that the state won't tolerate the threat to state money by stablecoins like the Facebook-led Libra.  The strategy came out as a result of the broad consultations with the industry, which started this spring and involved 158 experts and company representatives, who submitted a combined 6,261 responses. The approach embraces open-source software and the government as the ultimate arbiter of tech competition.  Identity exploration  Germany will seriously explore the use of blockchains for digital identity, according to the strategy.  The government itself will launch a pilot project for a blockchain-based digital identity in the near future (though, no particular time frame was provided), aimed to study the tech's benefits in use cases like maintaining the records of civil status, document registration, passports and ID cards.  “It will examine whether these blockchain-based digital identities provide clear added value compared to existing solutions and whether they can be designed in such a way that they comply with legal data protection requirements,” the document says.  The consultations showed that the German public trusts the government primarily as the guardian of citizens' personal information. “It has also become clear that the state is seen as the central organizer or regulator of digital personal identities. The state is under an obligation to guarantee data protection and security in regulatory terms,” as per the document.  Enterprises have been working on blockchain identity solutions for years now, with a recent effort using bitcoin's ledger announced by Microsoft this spring.  However, none of the proposed solutions have yet achieved a dominating role on the market, so the German government aims to test the interoperability of the various systems and have them compete for the right to serve Germans, the strategy says.  Smart machines, smart contracts  The internet of things is another area of future exploration: Germany is planning to tender for research proposals on digital identification and verification for autonomous gadgets.  “In particular, blockchain technology, embedded SIM/embedded Universal Integrated Circuit Card, multi-factor authentication and other hardware and software procedures are to be considered,” the strategy reads.  The use of distributed ledgers and smart contracts for maintaining standards and certification is another planned area of study, with the technology to be applied in such a way so that an ordinary user can understand what’s going on.  The document explains:  “The technical layman cannot comprehend what the Smart Contract actually technically implements. This leads to the demand that Smart Contracts should be combined with an obligation to provide information.”  In addition to that, according to the document, participants in the paper's consultations have called for such applications to be somehow controlled by the public and “certified by an official institution.”  To enhance the interoperability of the future tech solutions, the strategy encourages the use of open-source software. Moreover, “the Federal Government is committed to ensuring that application solutions for blockchain have interoperable and open interfaces for linking with other (blockchain) applications.”  Faster securities  The strategy restates the nation's plan to legitimize distributed ledger tech (DLT)-based securities, previously announced by the nation’s Ministry of Finance, in which it committed to allowing the securities to exist in a purely digital form, including on the blockchain.  “If securities were now issued on a blockchain, the execution and settlement of securities transactions could ... be carried out more cost-effectively and more quickly than has been the case to date,” the strategy reads.  A draft law on digital securities is scheduled to be introduced by the end of this year, according to the document. The new legislation should be “technology-neutral” and, in its first iteration, only relate to digital bonds. If that goes well, digital shares and investment funds on the blockchain will be considered as a next step.  The first government-approved deal of this kind has already been launched. This summer, Berlin-based startup Fundament issued $280 million-worth of tokenized bonds backed by real estate. It was the first time the Germany’s financial regulator, BaFIN, granted a permission for such an offering.  The government will also explore the ways DLT can be used for corporate governance, serving use cases like share settlement, exercise of share rights, the use of membership rights in cooperatives, and others.  Tough on stablecoins  While no cryptocurrency was named in the document as an object for regulation, the document underscores that Germany doesn’t want any stablecoin to get dominance in the country, as well as in the EU.  The strategy document states:  “In principle, there is a regulatory regime for stablecoins in the European Union. At the European and international level, the Federal Government will work to ensure that stablecoins do not become an alternative to state currencies.""  The government will also work with Germany’s central bank on a form of “digital central bank money,” it adds.  That portion of the strategy appears to have been prompted by the Facebook-led Libra project. On Sept. 1, Germany and France made a joint statement saying that they haven't been convinced that Libra will prevent money laundering and terrorism financing and protect investors, and further that it poses a threat to “monetary sovereignty.” As a result, they plan to oppose the project in the EU.  Overall, the blockchain strategy in general is expected to keep Germany at the top of the jurisdictions preferred by innovators and investors, the document says.  German parliament member Thomas Heilmann, the main proponent of the new blockchain and cryptocurrency policies in the nation’s senate, told CoinDesk he expects Germany to become a comfortable place to carry out DLT-related business. He said:  ""The home of the emerging token economy will be in Germany, just as Silicon Valley became a hotspot for previous innovations.""

By the time they leave, everyone there is jazzed about bitcoin.  That’s how the three founders of the Israeli investment platform iAngels are promoting crypto adoption, by working with blockchain startups to secure investment and educating traditional venture capitalists about the space.  “We’re building the crypto ecosystem together with them,” iAngels co-founder Mor Assia said of her firm's startup portfolio, which includes an equity stake in mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain and token holdings in everything from Tezos to Telegram. “Having an engineering background is very helpful when talking with entrepreneurs, especially when doing deep dives on specific technologies.”  Plus, according to the team, the iAngels subsidiary fund 21M Capital has more than $60 million in assets under management, with bitcoin making up 20 percent of the portfolio. Co-founder Agada Nameri, the former lawyer, told CoinDesk that the fund has provided 40 percent returns this year to investors who were skeptical about holding crypto assets directly.  “Most of our investors are more traditional,” Nameri told CoinDesk in Tel Aviv. “We are able to provide portfolio management in this industry. … We’re the bridge between the old world and this new industry.”  The third co-founder, Shelly Hod Moyal, added:  “I definitely see myself as a bitcoiner. We manage funds for thousands of investors from 50 countries. … We’ve been very active in explaining and educating. I’ve had talks in elderly homes explaining to them what is bitcoin, and what is blockchain.”  Regardless of how they view themselves, these investors don’t match how most people expect “bitcoiners” to look and act. They aren’t bitcoin purists, having participated in initial coin offerings by startups like Orbs and Bancor. Yet even beyond being a woman-led investment firm, a rarity in its own right, these women acknowledge there’s a delicious irony coloring their participation in the space.  In particular, Assia, wife of eToro founder Yoni Assia, is also the daughter-in-law of First International Bank of Israel board member David Assia. Even as part of one of the most powerful banking families in Israel, Assia is educating her four children to value decentralized technology more than traditional financial institutions.  “This is the way they’re going to live their lives,” she said. “They’re not going to be reliant on traditional banking.”  Image: iAngels co-founders Agada Nameri, Shelly Hod Moyal and Mor Assia (left to right) via Ali Powell for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/18/these-iangels-are-bringing-new-heavyweights-into-bitcoin-investing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/033ce086ca64b819be60a6f192648292d8baf567-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Before leaving the firm over a scandal involving his affair with a Russian spy, Byrne in July had arranged for Overstock's next investor dividend to be paid out in a digital security listed on its tZERO subsidiary’s trading platform.  Approved by the company’s board of directors, the dividend will see that one digital voting series A-1 preferred stock (series A-1) will represent 10 shares of common stock, or 10 shares of voting series B preferred stock, the firm said at the time.  It also specified that the digital stock could only be traded through a Dinosaur Financial Group brokerage account and would not be tradeable for six months after the Nov. 25 distribution.  In an announcement emailed to CoinDesk on Wednesday, however, Overstock said it's putting the dividend on hold temporarily in order to restructure it to make the stock freely tradeable and do away with the six-month lockup.  ""In order to provide greater liquidity, we are working with the appropriate regulatory authorities to structure the issuance of the dividend shares so they would be freely tradable by non-affiliates immediately upon distribution. We believe this will be a major benefit to investors,"" the firm said, adding that it's ""working closely with regulators to register the shares and achieve that result.""  The change comes a day after a New York Post report that suggested the digital dividend had been thought up by Byrne as a means to stymie short sellers of Overstock stock, who he has long accused of targeting the firm. Byrne's even said the shorting conspiracy was led by an anonymous criminal he dubbed the “Sith Lord.”  The report further said that Byrne's plan had briefly worked, since the short sellers were not willing to deal with the tokenized dividends. As a result, Overstock's share price shot up to a 52-week high last week.  New York Post sources, however, said that JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley brokers had opened the doors for the short sellers, offering to accept dollars at an equivalent value to the blockchain-based stock – news that caused Overstock's stock price to drop by over 40 percent after Friday's high.  Overstock said in its announcement that it expects to announce a new record date for the dividend in roughly three to six weeks. After that, a new distribution date will be provided, ""which may be sooner or later than the previously announced November 15, 2019 distribution date.""

42382678,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sbnX,1568806804,People With Least Knowledge Most Positive on Crypto's Future: ING,"People with less knowledge about cryptocurrency are the most likely to be positive on its future, according to new research from Dutch bank ING.  In a survey published Wednesday – which polled around 1,000 people in each of 15 mostly European countries – ING found that, overall, the level of detailed knowledge about crypto is fairly low.  While 74 percent answered correctly that cryptocurrencies are a form of digital money, roughly the same amount (73 percent) said cryptos are run by a centralized body, or didn't know. A small majority were, however, correct when answering questions on volatility and in-store acceptance.  Examining how attitudes vary among the pools of people with varying knowledge of the subject, ING found that the least knowledgeable were the most positive.  The report states:  ""Of the 13% in Europe who could correctly identify one of the five statements as either true or false, and therefore were labelled as having low knowledge, most either had a high (43%) or medium (37%) attitude towards the future of cryptocurrencies. This was almost identical for those who could correctly identify two or three out of the five statements, demonstrating medium knowledge.""  Respondents with greater knowledge showed more negative sentiment in the survey, with just 32 percent being positive about the future use of cryptos.  ""People are wary of cryptocurrencies – a reflection, most probably, of their being new and relatively intricate. The workings of blockchain, the idea of mining for something intangible and storing it in a digital wallet is, after all, novel and unfamiliar for many,"" ING said in the report.  Of those that knew at least a little about the subject, Turkey was the only nation with a majority of respondents displaying positive attitudes (62 percent). Aside from Romania (44 percent) and Poland (43 percent), most nations had levels of around 30 percent or lower.  People were roughly equally split in the survey when asked to respond to statements on crypto's role as the future of online spending and investment. Thirty-two percent said it is the future of online spending, down from 35 percent in 2018.  Thirty-five percent expected the value of cryptocurrencies to rise in the next 12 months.

42382683,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sbq3,1568804417,Bitcoin May Be Building for Move as Price Volatility Nears 5-Month Low,"View  Bitcoin’s price volatility, as represented by Bollinger bandwidth, has hit the lowest level since May 3, and is closing on a level seen ahead of violent price swings in the past.  While technical charts are increasingly favoring a downside move, bitcoin’s non-price metrics continue to call a bullish move, which, so far, has remained elusive.  BTC risks falling to $9,855 (Sept. 11 low) in the next couple of days and could extend the decline toward $9,320 (Aug. 29 low).  The bearish case would weaken above Sept. 13’s high of $10,458. The outlook, as per the daily chart would turn bullish above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high).      Bitcoin’s volatility has hit its lowest level in over four months – a price squeeze that may force a significant move either way.  BTC’s bull run stalled at highs above $13,800 on June 26 and prices have created lower highs and higher lows ever since.  Notably, the trading range has narrowed sharply over the last two weeks, with bitcoin consolidating between $9,850 and 10,950, as per Bitstamp data.  As a result, the Bollinger bands – volatility indicators placed 2 standard deviations above and below the price’s 20-day moving average – have narrowed sharply.  More importantly, Bollinger bandwidth, an indicator used to gauge market volatility, has dropped to 0.11 – the lowest reading since May. 3, as seen in the chart below.  Bollinger Bandwidth  The volatility level has dropped steadily from 0.62 to lows near 0.10 in the 2.5-months.  In the past, BTC has witnessed big moves following drops to or below 0.10 (marked by arrows).  For instance, the bandwidth dropped to 0.06 a week before BTC broke into a bull market with a high-volume move to $5,000 on April 2. It also fell to 0.10 on May 2 – a day before BTC jumped above $5,600, marking an upside break of a three-week-long consolidation. And, in the days leading up to last November’s sell-off below $6,000, volatility dropped to 0.05.  If history is a guide, then BTC could soon witness a big move on either side. Technical analysis theory also states than an extended period of low volatility is often followed by a big move.  While the record high hash rate (miner confidence) is calling a bullish move, the technical charts are beginning to favor the bears.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,170 on Bitstamp, representing little change on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  Bitcoin jumped 2.6 percent on Sept. 12, confirming an upside break of a falling wedge pattern. The bullish breakout, however, failed to draw bids and the cryptocurrency has ended up creating another lower high at $10,458 (Sept. 13 high).  With the failed breakout, the bearish view put forward by Sept. 6’s big red engulfing candle has gained credence.  BTC risks falling back to the Sept. 11 low of $9,855 in the short-term. A violation there would open the doors for $9,320 (Aug. 29 low).  A few observers are calling for a deeper drop to levels below $8,000. That possibility cannot be ruled out as the cryptocurrency is looking heavy on the longer duration charts.  Monthly and weekly charts  The back-to-back inside bar candlestick patterns on the monthly chart (above left) indicate buyer exhaustion following a stellar rally from $4,000 to $13,880.  A bearish ""inside bar"" reversal would be confirmed if prices close (UTC) below $9,049 – the low of the first inside bar created in July – on Sept. 30.  Further, a negative reading on the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicates scope for a deeper pullback.  The bearish case would weaken if prices rise above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high), invalidating the lower highs setup on the daily chart.  That said, a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed for bull revival, as discussed last month.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42382660,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sbS9,1568799908,Craig Wright 'in Discussions' to Settle Multi-Billion-Dollar Court Case,"Craig Wright, the Australian entrepreneur who controversially claims he is Satoshi Nakamoto, is moving to settle a case that looks set to cost him billions in bitcoin.  The case has been ongoing since 2018, when Ira Kleiman – the brother of Wright’s late business partner Dave Kleiman – sued for $10 billion, claiming that Wright was trying to seize Dave’s bitcoin holdings.  Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart ruled in late August that Wright must turn over half of his bitcoin holdings and intellectual property from before 2014 to Kleiman's estate.  Now, before that decision is finalized, Wright has lodged a filing with the Southern Florida district court requesting more time to negotiate a settlement with the Kleiman estate.  Filed on Sept. 17, the document states:  ""The parties are currently engaged in good faith settlement discussions. To that end, Dr. Wright and Plaintiffs respectfully request a 30-day extension of all discovery and case deadlines to facilitate these discussions.""  It goes on to elaborate that ""extensive settlement negotiations"" have been carried out and that the parties have come to a ""non-binding agreement in principle to settle this matter."" The negotiation of the agreement is ongoing, and the two sides are currently hashing out the terms and details.  Saying that a settlement is in the interest of both parties, Wright's legal representative requested that the court allow the 30-day extension. It would also allow Wright to cut off further deadlines in the case, such as expert witness disclosures. He further plans to oppose Judge Reinhart's sanctions order on Sept. 24.  The Kleiman estate supported the request for more time to finalize the settlement.  During the case, Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart did not find Wright to be credible, and did not make a finding on whether or not Wright is indeed Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s creator.

42382662,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sbVv,1568794518,New York Among 13 States Excluded as Binance.US Opens for Registrations,"The U.S. arm of cryptocurrency exchange Binance is opening for registration and deposits on Wednesday.  The platform will go live supporting just six cryptocurrencies initially – bitcoin, (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC) and the tether stablecoin (USDT). Binance's own BNB token is also supported. The platform expects more cryptos to be added in ""coming weeks,"" providing they pass Binance.US's Digital Asset Risk Assessment Framework.  Notably, Binance's recently launched dollar-linked stablecoin BUSD is not supported.  The new launch comes after stateside users of its global platform Binance.com were barred from trading back in June. The company did not provide reasons for the restriction at the time, but it was almost certainly over regulatory concerns.  In a blog post on the launch of registrations on Tuesday, Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley – who left a role as head of XRP Institutional Liquidity at Ripple in July to join the firm – explained that the U.S. rollout is to be ""gradual"" with 13 states not supported at launch.  These include New York, Florida and Texas. Previously, when U.S. residents were allowed to use Binance.com, the firm listed just six U.S. states as restricted from trading.  Coley said:  ""Although it is upsetting that we cannot offer Binance.US in the states where I grew up and earned my education at this time, please rest assured that this is just the beginning, and it is our mission to bring access to those of you in these states many of us call home.""  The post also sets out the fees that will be charged for trading – which will start once sufficient liquidity has been achieved through new deposits.  Describing the fee structure as ""straightforward, Coley said that personal accounts will be charged a flat fee of 0.10 percent per trade, while corporate accounts will see charges vary depending on their trading volume. Until Nov. 1, 2019, though, Binance.US is charging zero fees for all users.  User who already have deposits with Binance.com will not see their funds automatically transferred to the U.S. platform, Coley said. She cited the fact that Binance.US is a separate entity operated by BAM Trading Services as the reason. BAM Trading is registered with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in the U.S.  Answering her own question as to whether Binance.US is protecting users' deposits with insurance, Coley said: ""Binance.US takes security seriously. We prioritize customer protection and have measures dedicated to protecting customers from theft and hacking.""  It's not clear if the new entity will offer a similar protection scheme as Binance, which notably provides the Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU). After a $40.7 million hack back in May, the fund was used to repay all affected users.

Announced today by the company, the grant by the ESA’s “kick-start activities” fund bolsters SpaceChain’s efforts to put a hyper-secure, multi-signature, distributed satellite network in orbit. The company has already flight-tested blockchain nodes in space.  The tech uses a three signature system, with two ground-based signatures and a third in orbit, on the satellite. Each transaction requires at least two of the three signatures to complete.  Zee Zheng, SpaceChain’s co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk that his satellite-based nodes are far more secure than terrestrial networks processing on the open internet with data and protocols uplinking directly to the satellite.  “We don’t need internet access to perform this kind of transaction,” Zheng said, “which eliminates a lot of potential risks for hacking.”  “We are looking at a market that last year saw $1 billion in crypto stolen. That will be much much more difficult for hackers [on our system],” he added.  Zheng called his grant from the ESA an opportunity for the crypto community to learn more about blockchain space applications. He noted developers’ high interest in the security upside.  “We want to use this opportunity to showcase how space can benefit the blockchain space,” Zheng said. He added SpaceChain plans to launch three times over the next 18 months.

The company said in an announcement on Tuesday it has launched Huobi Argentina, a local exchange that will facilitate purchases of a range of cryptocurrencies with the Argentine peso.  Huobi also plans to open a fiat gateway for the exchange in October, enabling people to buy cryptocurrencies via credit cards, wire transfers and other commonly used payment methods in Argentina, including Mercadopago.  The exchange said the demand for cryptocurrency in Argentina is driven by the country’s openness to the nascent technology and the need to find an alternative to mitigate the risks caused by the peso devaluation.  Argentina ranks fourth in terms of the percentage of cryptocurrency adoption worldwide with 16 percent, according to a report by market data provider Statista. The report notes that Latin America has more crypto users than any other region percentage-wise.  ""Argentina's volatile economic situation, including the country's newly imposed currency controls and rampant inflation, creates a flourishing environment for cryptocurrency adoption,” the exchange said.  Argentina recently imposed currency controls to stabilize the peso markets, restricting residents from purchasing foreign currencies.  “The increasing demand for crypto-related products and services makes Argentina a perfect entry point for Huobi to pursue larger projects in promoting cryptocurrency and blockchain to the market,” David Chen, senior business director at Huobi Cloud, said in the statement.
