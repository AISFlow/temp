34507990,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647124,1728514813,"XRP Price Set To Soar Past $5.85, Predicts Crypto Analyst","Crypto analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark) has issued a bullish forecast for XRP, projecting a price surge above $5.85 based on a confluence of technical indicators and chart patterns. Despite recent market stagnation, the analyst highlights several key factors—including the application of Elliott Wave theory—that suggest a significant upward movement is imminent. Why XRP Looks Still ‘Super Bullish’ According to Dark Defender, the XRP price is currently determined by three trend lines. Two of these trend lines form a symmetrical triangle pattern, while the third—a downward-sloping orange line—represents a long-term downtrend that XRP has recently broken above on the monthly chart. Related Reading: Bollinger Bands Indicate XRP Price Surge Ahead Despite SEC Challenges: Expert The symmetrical triangle, formed by two converging trendlines, shows a 4-year long period of consolidation. This pattern is generally considered a continuation pattern, meaning that the price is likely to continue in the direction of the existing trend upon breakout. In XRP’s case, the price has tried to break to the upside several times – thus far without success. The third trendline, the downward-sloping orange line, has been acting as a significant resistance level for XRP since summer 2021. The fact that XRP has broken above this long-term downtrend line on the monthly chart is a strong bullish signal. This breakout suggests a shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish, potentially leading to substantial price appreciation. Integral to Dark Defender’s analysis is the application of Elliott Wave theory to XRP’s price action. The chart shared by the analyst displays an Elliott Wave count that suggests XRP is poised to enter a Wave 3 impulse move, historically the most powerful and extended wave in the five-wave trend sequence. In this context, the analyst believes that XRP has completed Wave 2—a corrective phase characterized by downward price movement—and is now embarking on Wave 3. This wave is often marked by strong momentum and increased market participation, potentially explaining the anticipated surge above $5.85. The projected target aligns with Fibonacci extension levels commonly associated with Wave 3 movements, providing a technical basis for the significant price increase. In the short term, the 70.2% Fibonacci price level at $0.6649 is the most crucial resistance for XRP. If this barrier breaks, wave 3 could be confirmed. A first major extension target would be the 161.8% Fibonacci level at $1.88. The ultimate target could be the 261.8% Fibonacci level at $5.85. Related Reading: XRP Macro Charts Signal Explosive Bullish Move Despite SEC Appeal: Analyst The analyst also points out that the Heikin Ashi candles are currently averaging at $0.57 on the monthly chart. “When Heikin Ashi Candles (average-price candles, currently at $0.57) are considered, the monthly average price stays above the support level, which is critical for XRP to continue the momentum,” Dark Defender notes. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the monthly timeframe has printed a green dot, a bullish signal suggesting increasing upward momentum. The MACD is a momentum oscillator that helps traders identify potential trend reversals. A green dot typically signifies that the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, indicating a positive shift in momentum. Ultimately, Dark Defender contends that XRP’s price action is largely independent of external news events, including developments related to the SEC lawsuit against Ripple. While acknowledging that such news can have a minor impact, the analyst argues that technical patterns and indicators hold more sway over XRP’s movements. “As most expected, nothing happened after the appeal decision. XRP just were at the Ichimoku clouds top around $0.60+ levels and bounced back from there to $0.50+. I am Bullish; why? As I always highlight, XRP does not follow any news such as SEC. OK, they have a minor impact, but that’s it,” Dark Defender notes. Based on the technical factors outlined—including the breakout above the long-term downtrend line, the significance of the symmetrical triangle, the importance of the Heikin Ashi monthly average price, bullish signals from the MACD, and the Elliott Wave count—Dark Defender is “super bullish” on XRP. The analyst anticipates that the asset will follow historical patterns leading to a price exceeding $5.85. At press time, XRP traded at $0.53.

BTC started the day around $62,000, then slipped ever lower during the later hours of the U.S. trading session to $60,400, down 2.4% over the past 24 hours. Ether {{ETH}} held up slightly better for most part of the day, then dived 3.2%.  What likely weighed on prices was reports circulating about seized cryptos linked to the PlusToken ponzi scheme being moved to exchanges during the day, raising concerns of potential selling pressure coming to the market.  Chinese authorities seized nearly $4 billion worth of crypto, including ETH, BTC dogecoin {{DOGE}}, xrp {{XRP}} from the PlusToken operators in November 2020.  One observer noted that some 7,000 ETH, worth $16 million, of the remaining $1.3 billion ETH was moved to exchanges in the past 24 hours, which may indicate an intention to sell the assets.  Microcaps pump on market manipulation charges  Strange action happened at some unexpected corners of the crypto market.  Earlier today, U.S. federal prosecutors charged crypto trading firms Gotbit, ZM Quant, CLS Global and MyTrade and their employees with market manipulation and fraud. Notably, a CoinDesk report in 2019 detailed how Alexey Andryunin, the co-founder of Gotbit and one of the individuals charged by prosecutors, built a business out of faking exchange volumes for tiny crypto tokens using trading bots to get listed on price aggregators like CoinMarketCap.  Robo inu (RBIF), one of the tokens mentioned in the documents, more than doubled in price for a brief minute on the news, and was still up 20% during the day, per CoinGecko data.  Prosecutors created a cryptocurrency called NexFundAI Token at the direction of law enforcement for the investigation, a court document showed. A token with the ticker NEX with insignificant market value surged as much as 3,500% as speculators rushed to chase the potential token to profit off the attention.  Then, its price quickly tumbled as the document also said that prosecutors had already disabled trading with the token before unsealing the charges.  Less dovish Fed  A check on traditional markets showed the S&P 500 closing the day at a new all-time high, with the tech-focused Nasdaq climbing 0.6%.

34505478,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647142,1728509424,"Standard Chartered Analysts Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $10,000 If This Happens","Analysts at British multinational bank, Standard Chartered have predicted that the price of Ethereum (ETH) could potentially climb to $10,000 in response to the anticipated political changes set to take place following the upcoming United States (US) Presidential elections. Standard Chartered Predicts Ethereum To $10,000 In a research note by the head of Standard Chartered crypto research, Geoffrey Kendrick, Ethereum could experience a dramatic rise to $10,000 if Donald Trump, the former US President wins the upcoming election. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Turns Green In October Once Again, Is The Bull Run Here? Delving into the potential impact of a Trump administration on the future of the digital asset industry, Kendrick predicts that both Ethereum and Solana (SOL) will outperform Bitcoin (BTC) significantly, reaching new all-time highs. The report posits that changes in a country’s political regime tend to have a significant influence on the trajectory of leading digital assets over time. Based on this observation, Kendrick expects Solana to significantly outperform Ethereum under a Trump regime. While Ethereum will witness significant growth and possibly maintain its rank as the top altcoin with the largest market capitalization, a Trump win could change the market dynamics, potentially triggering even higher gains and adoption for its competitor, Solana. On a different note, if the current US Vice President, Kamala Harris wins the upcoming elections, Kendrick’s report projects that Ethereum could surge to $7,000, marking a 30% or $3,000 drop from the projected $10,000 target under a Trump administration. However, under Harris’s leadership, Ethereum will solidify its position as the leading altcoin, potentially outperforming Bitcoin and Solana in gains. It’s important to note that Standard Chartered has cut down its earlier forecast for Ethereum by nearly 50%, underscoring the volatility and unpredictability of the market. In an earlier report, the multinational bank had predicted that Ethereum could reach $14,000 by 2025, driven by the approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs. Although Spot Ethereum ETFs have gained said approval and are now trading, Ethereum’s price remains significantly below $3,000. Nevertheless, the results of the US Presidential elections scheduled for November 5, could have a more bullish impact on Ethereum, potentially triggering a massive run to new highs. ETH Faces Drop To $1,600 If Key Support Fails While market experts deliver optimistic projections for Ethereum’s price, a prominent crypto analyst, Ali Martinez has taken a more bearish stance, predicting a significant decline for this altcoin if it fails to hold a crucial support level. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Forecasts ADA Price Rocket To $5 In an X (formerly Twitter) post on Monday, Martinez disclosed that if Ethereum can stay above the $2,300 support threshold, its price could breakout to new all-time highs of $6,000. On the other hand, if the top altcoin fails to maintain this level, it could trigger a massive drop to the next support at $1,600. As of writing, the price of Ethereum is trading at $2,432, and a decrease to $1,600 would represent a massive 34.21% plunge for the cryptocurrency.

42407431,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHSGf,1728507481,SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Crypto: ‘It’s Unlikely This Stuff Is Gonna Be a Currency’,"NEW YORK — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler said he thinks it's unlikely that bitcoin {{BTC}} or other cryptocurrencies will ever be widely used as a form of payment and, instead, will continue to be seen as more of a store of value.  Speaking at an event at NYU School of Law in Manhattan on Wednesday, Gensler responded to a question from an attendee about what the value of cryptocurrency – which was created to be separate from any government – would be to its users if totally brought into the regulatory fold.  Gensler said that the agency is ""merit neutral"" and the investing public will get to decide – ""through disclosures"" if there's a utility for any given cryptocurrency.  ""But I did teach this stuff up at MIT and so forth, so I'm just going say this – these debates literally go back to Plato and Aristotle,"" he said. ""This is 3,000 years of history. Hundreds of great nations, thousands of nation-states – we tend to have one currency per geographic economic state. We tend even not to have bimetallism.""  Gensler cited Gresham's law – a monetary principle dating back to the 19th century that asserts that ""bad money drives out the good"" – and added that nations typically want just a single currency.  ""You want one currency unit because it's a store of value, a medium of exchange, a unit of account. It all has tremendous economics of networks,"" Gensler said. ""So it's unlikely this stuff is going to be a currency. It's going to have to show its value through disclosure, through use. ... The same way you pick amongst the thousands of securities that are listed on the stock exchange.""  Fraudsters, grifters and scams  During the wide-ranging conversation with NYU Law Professor Robert Jackson, Gensler defended his agency's track record of aggressive enforcement actions against crypto companies.  ""Without a cop on the beat, will all our laws be enforced?"" Gensler asked. ""It's something about human nature. In finance … we play near to the line. … We sometimes need to bring the enforcement actions to bring people back to the right side of the line.""  He said that the crypto industry was rife with ""a lot of fraudsters, a lot of grifters, a lot of scams,"" adding: ""With all respect, the leading lights of this field in [2024] are either in jail or awaiting extradition right now.""  Gensler added that he sees no need for additional regulatory framework beyond the one granted by the Supreme Court in 1940: the Howey Test.  ""If anybody is wondering whether [they] might meet this time-tested test of what is an investment contract … think about it this way, who is signing the engagement letter with your law firm? There's a central enterprise, somebody is signing that engagement letter. Who is tapping on the door of the broker-dealer saying, 'Can you make a market in my particular asset?' It belies logic that there's no common enterprise at most,"" Gensler said.  Gensler declined to comment on how the upcoming presidential election could impact the SEC, or whether he would step down if former President Trump were to win re-election.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/09/sec-chair-gary-gensler-on-crypto-its-unlikely-this-stuff-is-gonna-be-a-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b718925f7883639faddc9e1aa2ffc7de2376bba-4030x2267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The market is experiencing uncertainty and anxiety after the past week’s euphoria surrounding the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates. Related Reading: Can SUI Fall To $1.40? On-Chain Data Exposes Declining Demand Despite this positive news, recent price movements have concerned traders who anticipated a massive surge for XRP this cycle. The current situation has increased caution among investors, as many are now looking for confirmation above or below the critical liquidity level. This hesitance has left some analysts sharing predictions based on the latest price action, adding uncertainty. As XRP hovers near this pivotal point, traders are closely monitoring whether it can break through resistance or if it will fall back, which would signal a shift in momentum. The next few days are crucial, as they will likely reveal whether the altcoin can sustain its upward trajectory or if it will succumb to market pressures, impacting not just this token but potentially the broader altcoin market. Analyst Expects XRP Rally Soon XRP is currently facing serious risk as it hovers around the critical $0.50-$0.55 area. For the price to confirm a bullish continuation, it must hold above this level in the coming days. Analysts and investors are eagerly waiting for a signal that could trigger a price surge, particularly as the broader market is experiencing uncertainty following recent fluctuations. Top analyst and investor Ali has shared an optimistic view of XRP through a technical analysis posted on X. In his analysis, Ali presents a chart illustrating the governing pattern of XRP price action since June 2022, which appears to form an ascending parallel channel. This channel indicates a potential upward trajectory, and if this pattern continues, XRP could move toward the channel’s middle or upper boundaries, currently sitting at approximately $0.80 and $1.10, respectively. This move would represent a potential surge of 75% or more for XRP in the coming weeks. However, this optimistic outlook hinges on XRP’s position above the critical support level. If it fails to do so, it risks a deeper correction, which could dampen investor sentiment and halt any upward momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Expects A ‘Multi-Year Bullish Breakout’ – 200% Surge Potential As traders watch closely for further price action and potential breakouts, the next few days will determine whether XRP can reclaim its bullish trajectory or succumb to broader market pressures. The sentiment among analysts is cautiously optimistic, and the community is poised for action based on XRP’s ability to navigate this pivotal point. Technical Analysis: Key Levels To Watch XRP is trading at $0.53 after losing the daily 200 moving average (MA) at $0.54 and the 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.55. This recent price action has raised concerns among traders as the price struggles to maintain upward momentum. However, the price still holds above the critical support level at $0.50, a key psychological threshold. If the price were to drop below this level, it could trigger significant selling pressure, leading to a deeper decline. On the other hand, if bulls can reclaim both the 200 MA and EMA, it would signal a potential shift in momentum. A successful breakout above $0.65 could pave the way for a substantial rally, reigniting bullish sentiment in the market. This scenario hinges on XRP’s ability to regain its footing and gather enough buying pressure to push through these critical resistance levels.

Allegations Of Price And Trading Volume Manipulations According to a court filing by the US District Court of the District of Boston Massachusetts, one of the companies charged is crypto trading firm ZM Quant, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands. Prosecutors allege that from approximately 2022 to 2024, ZM Quant conspired to manipulate the trading volume and prices of various undisclosed cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: ETH’s Fate Hinges On $2,300: Will Ethereum Soar To $6,000 Or Dive To $1,600? The scheme allegedly allowed the company to profit by receiving payments from crypto companies and selling the manipulated cryptocurrencies at what prosecutors said were “inflated prices”. The court filings detail the objectives of the conspiracy, suggesting that the primary intent was to engage in market manipulation and wire fraud. Prosecutors allege that the conspirators aimed to enrich themselves at the expense of market integrity and investor trust. Crypto Fraud Charges In addition to ZM Quant, the indictment includes other firms—Gotbit, CLS Global, and MyTrade—along with their executives and employees. This coordinated enforcement action also involved international arrests. Notably, five individuals connected to the case have already entered guilty pleas or agreed to plead guilty, indicating a potential willingness to cooperate with authorities.

42407439,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHSkQ,1728503019,CPI Growth Is Set to Slow Even More,"Inflation growth is rapidly closing in on the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.  One of my favorite parts of every morning is drinking coffee. After my espresso maker warms up, I look forward to making two lattes, each with an extra shot of espresso. It has become such a part of my routine that often, I feel like my day can’t get started without it.  Prior to COVID, the routine was a little different. Back then, I still looked forward to my daily coffees, but instead of making them, I enjoyed walking out to purchase them. I would come into the office, get my morning work done, and then shoot out to see my favorite barista and a hot cup of joe.  That all changed when I first came back to the office. You see, before the break, I was spending about $10/day or $5/cup. But the first thing I noticed when I grabbed my initial coffee was the price had jumped to $7.50. While the $5/cup didn’t really bother me before, because it had been that price for years, this price increase did.  Soon, I was cutting back to going out for just one cup a day. And, before long, it was only a couple of cups a week. After saving all that money from making coffee on my own, the 50% jump in price per cup was like a punch in the face. I no longer saw the need for it.  Well, I was recently pressed for time and couldn’t make coffee on my own. So, I stopped in to grab a latte. And when I paid for it, I noticed the price was still the same. I’m sure many of you, like me, are experiencing similar situations. After seeing prices for all types of goods shoot up after the pandemic, you’re less willing to waste as many of your hard-earned dollars on buying them.  Later this week, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release inflation growth metrics for September. And when that number is reported, it will show price pressures have hit their lowest level since February 2021. The change will support more rate cuts by our central bank, underpinning a steady rally in risk assets like cryptocurrencies.  But don’t take my word for it, let’s look at what the data’s telling us.  Every month, the Dallas, Kansas City, New York, and Philadelphia Feds ask manufacturers in their districts about the state of activity. The questionnaires ask those companies about things like new orders, lead times, employment, and production. It asks whether the costs are rising, falling, or unchanged.  But we must focus on “prices received for goods.” The number indicates what customers pay manufacturers for their finished product. It’s akin to CPI. So, the direction of prices received is an indicator of whether inflation is rising or falling.  Now, the states where those four banks are headquartered – Texas, Missouri, New York, and Pennsylvania – account for roughly 25% of domestic economic output. So, we can get a decent idea of national demand. But the results come out ahead of CPI, so it’s like having an early look into the data.  And the latest readings indicate prices received fell…  In the above chart, I combined the readings from the four central banks into a single gauge. It’s called the combined prices received index (CPRI) and is represented by the blue line. I then compared it to CPI (orange line). As you can see, CPRI tends to be a leading indicator. It peaked in October of 2021. Yet, it wasn’t until June of 2022 that CPI finally reached a 40+ year high before starting to roll over.  As you’ll notice in the above chart, my index held a steady trend throughout 2019 and the start of 2020. Inflation growth followed suit, remaining under 2%. But then, when businesses sent workers home during the pandemic onset, the CPRI gauge dropped. And, as the economy reopened, it took off. In each instance, we see that CPI does the same, but on a lagged basis.  Now, it appears the CPRI trend is stabilizing. You can see this by looking at the right side of the above chart. This is happening as we’ve seen consumers’ excess COVID savings evaporate and spending slow. That means individuals are becoming increasingly price conscious and hanging onto more of their money.  In December 2023, the gauge had a reading of 8.4. This past month the number was 8.8. In fact, so far this year, the index has held in a range between 5 and 10. This is important because the longer it holds steady, the more likely it is that inflation growth will slow. Because the annualized reading will drop the older numbers that are higher, helping to bring the CPI back below the 2% goal.  Over the last three months, inflation has grown at a pace of 0.1% per month. If that rate continues moving forward, we could see annualized growth drop to 1.5% by March 2025.  As you can see, the regional central bank’s economic team anticipates headline CPI will fall from 2.5% in August to 2.3% in September. That would mark the lowest reading since March 2021, when the numbers began to explode higher.  Like I said at the start, price growth is moderating. Manufacturers are telling us they’re having a harder time pushing price increases on to consumers. And, if my model is correct, we will see inflation growth come back to 2% sooner than later.  So, don’t be surprised when the report later this week confirms what my indicator’s telling us. Easing price pressures should increase the Fed’s conviction that inflation growth is slowing. That will give the central bank room to lower interest rates even more. The change will act as a tailwind for a steady long-term rally in risk assets priced in dollar terms, including bitcoin and ether.

42407424,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHS08,1728502795,"Prosecutors Charge Four Crypto ‘Market Makers,’ Employees With Market Manipulation, Fraud","Federal prosecutors charged four purported market makers, a handful of crypto projects, and over a dozen individuals with manipulating various crypto markets Wednesday, saying they profited from fees and selling manipulated coins at elevated values.  According to charging documents unsealed Wednesday, Gotbit, CLS Global, MyTrade and ZM Quant wash traded various tokens to make it appear they had more legitimate activity than they actually did, selling some of these tokens at ""artificially inflated prices"" to others, marketing these coins on various platforms and convincing exchanges to let them buy tokens with reduced fees.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also brought charges against ZM Quant and employees Baijun Ou and Ruiqi Lau; Gotbit and employee Feder Kedrov; and CLS Global with employee Andrey Zhorzhes, alongside a number of individuals described as ""crypto asset promoters"": Russell Armand, Maxwell Hernandez, Manpreet Singh Kohli, Nam Tran and Vy Pham. A representative for the Department of Justice (DOJ) said that the cases were referred to prosecution by the SEC over two years ago.  Prosecutors say that the market maker defendants publicly claimed to be legitimate market makers offering legal services, but privately offered clients illegal services including wash trading.  At least in Gotbit’s case, the illegal offerings weren’t really all that private: in 2019, Gotbit co-founder Alexey Andryunin, then a 20-year-old college sophomore,explained to CoinDeskexactly how the wash trading services he offered his clients worked. He was blunt about the questionable nature of his business, admitting that Gotbit was not registered in any jurisdiction because it was “not entirely ethical.” Separate criminal charges have been filed against Andryunin.  ZMQuant was registered in the British Virgin Islands, but the employees named in its indictment were based in Hong Kong. Though Gotbit was not registered anywhere, it's employees are believed to be Russian.  The list of manipulated tokens included Robo Inu, which pumped after the indictment was unsealed. Other named defendants include VZZN and Saitama. According to the indictments, each token – including Robo Inu – is classified as a security. Several of the people behind the projects, including Robo Inu founder Vy Pham, have also been named as defendants.  During the course of their investigation, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents created an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency, called NextFundAI, with the help of ""cooperating witnesses"" and used it to ""identify, disrupt, and bring these alleged fraudsters to justice,"" according to a Wednesday press release. The token, according to court documents, is also a security. A representative for the FBI added that there was limited trading ""activity"" on the coin but declined to share any additional information beyond what is currently available in public documents, including whether the FBI worked with any crypto companies on the project. Joshua Levy, the Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said trading on the token was disabled during a press call Wednesday afternoon.  Levy said during the call that the DOJ already has about $25 million it's secured from ""fraudulent proceeds"" that will go back to investors, though he did not share a full total of how much the defendants generated.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,"Cheyenne Ligon, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/09/prosecutors-charge-two-crypto-market-makers-employees-with-market-manipulation-fraud,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a665fece1a7890dcaa3dfcd1a17d9c1b0199ee05-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34500078,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647107,1728498637,SUI Faces A Pullback: Here Are Potential Bullish Turnaround Points,"SUI is experiencing a notable pullback after its recent rally, with multiple key support levels coming into focus. As the price edges lower, these areas will play a pivotal role in determining whether the asset can regain its bullish momentum. A strong defense of these supports could signal the start of a fresh upward move, while a failure to hold may lead to deeper declines. This article aims to assess SUI’s recent price pullback and explore critical support levels that could trigger a potential bullish reversal. By analyzing technical indicators and market conditions, it seeks to provide insights into possible recovery scenarios, highlighting the levels to watch for a sustained upward movement or further downside risk. Recent Price Action: SUI’s Decline Explained Recently, SUI’s price has taken a bearish turn on the 4-hour chart, following a rejection at the $2.1 resistance level. Despite this decline, the cryptocurrency remains above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating that a recovery may be possible, provided buyers regain control and the market shifts back in favor of the bulls. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that bulls could be preparing for a resurgence. Although the RSI has slipped to 55% from the overbought zone, it remains above the crucial 50% mark, indicating that bullish momentum persists. This positioning reflects a temporary slowdown, but as long as the RSI holds above this threshold, the market retains the potential for renewed upward movement. Related Reading: SUI Continues Bullish Run, Surges 45% In The Past Week — What Next? Also, on the daily chart, SUI is exhibiting signs of negative pressure, trading above the 100-day SMA. While the price remains above the SMA, this current bearish movement could be short-lived, as there remains a possibility for a price recovery. The positioning above the SMA implies that buyers could step in to reverse the trend if they regain control, potentially leading to a rebound in price. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a closer examination of the RSI formation indicates that SUI’s price may experience further declines, as the signal line has descended to 69% from the overbought territory. However, there is the possibility of a bullish comeback if the RSI can maintain its position above the 50% threshold. Key Support Levels: Where Could SUI Buyers Step In? SUI is approaching critical support levels that could attract buyers and trigger a recovery. The initial key level to monitor is the $1.4 support zone, which could serve as a critical point for renewed bullish interest. Related Reading: Can SUI Fall To $1.40? On-Chain Data Exposes Declining Demand Should buyers step in at this level, SUI might rebound toward the $2.1 resistance mark. A successful breakout above this resistance could pave the way for the formation of a new all-time high, signaling a strong resurgence. However, if the $1.4 support level fails, the next critical area to watch is around the $1.1 mark, where a stronger base of support could form as the price continues to decline. Maintaining these levels is crucial since it will determine whether SUI can regain upward momentum or remain vulnerable to more bearish pressure.

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Network news  Screengrab from Polymarket prediction market on HBO documentary. (Polymarket)  SATOSHI BLOOPERS: Bettors on Polymarket, the Polygon-based prediction market, got whipsawed amid speculation over whom a much-promoted HBO documentary would identify as Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Initially the focus was on Len Sassaman, who was once conjectured to be Satoshi because of his long history of published academic works regarding cryptography, which often showed his strong ideological commitment to privacy and decentralization. (He took his own life in 2011 after a battle with depression, and the theory that he was Satoshi has since been mostly discredited.) Eventually, as purported clips from the documentary started to leak out, the Polymarket odds shifted toward Peter Todd, an early contributor to Bitcoin. Indeed, in a tense scene toward the end of the film, with scary music playing in the background, the documentarian Cullen Hoback confronts Todd with the theory that he is Satoshi. It's ""ludicrous,"" Todd says in the undeniably awkward scene. Later, Todd told CoinDesk's Marc Hochstein in an interview with CoinDesk, ""Of course I'm not Satoshi."" Also, Todd posted on X that he agreed with the infamous Satoshi claimant Craig Wright's not-exactly-PG-rated assessment that the HBO documentary was not to be believed.  Ironically, or perhaps fittingly, Todd now might be trying to undo some of Satoshi's wrongs. Last month, in a long blog post analyzing Bitcoin layer-2 technologies, he acknowledged the reality that Satoshi was far from perfect when writing the blockchain's original code: ""There’s a number of things that Satoshi got wrong in the initial Bitcoin protocol, in particular, scripting DoS attacks, the timewarp attack, and issues with the merkle tree."" Todd suggested the possibility of a ""consensus cleanup soft-fork"" – an elaborate way of describing what would essentially be an upgrade to patch the bugs. HOW SUSPICIOUS IS THAT??? We're kidding of course. But maybe this will provide the gist for a gripping sequel.  ELSEWHERE:  Babylon, a Bitcoin staking platform billed as a new way of providing the original blockchain's security to new protocols and decentralized applications, pulled in about $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin on Tuesday after briefly opening to additional deposits. The uptake could show robust demand for a growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem atop the 15-year-old Bitcoin blockchain, previously confined to alternative networks like Ethereum and Solana.  Scroll, theteam behind the layer-2 network, shared Tuesday that it plans to launch a SCR token to support the blockchain. Ina blog post, the team said that the SCR token would be the first step in its roadmap to decentralization. “SCR will be used as a primary governance mechanism of the protocol and progress to being a protocol utility token as Scroll becomes more decentralized,” the team wrote.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommended that El Salvador narrow the scope of the bitcoin law and strengthen the regulatory framework and oversight of the bitcoin ecosystem. During a press conference, IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack also said that the IMF recommended El Salvador limiting public sector exposure to bitcoin, Reuters reported. This isn't the first time IMF has warned El Salvador. Most recently, in August, the IMF said something similar when it declared in a statement that “while many of the risks have not yet materialized, there is joint recognition that further efforts are needed to enhance transparency and mitigate potential fiscal and financial stability risks from the Bitcoin project.”  EigenLayer's EIGEN Token Floating Low as Criticisms Mount  I will reluctantly admit to watching many loops of this marketing video produced by Eigen Foundation in connection with the EIGEN token unlock. In this screenshot, what looks like a rogue sperm appears to leap out of a blueish ball that in turn appears to be falling down an infinity tunnel of concentric squares. (Eigen Foundation)  The headlines on EigenLayer's unlocking last week of its previously non-transferrable EIGEN tokens managed to sneak into The Protocol just as we went to press. But the drama and controversy unfolded for several days afterward, with fresh revelations, indignant recriminations and cynical reflections that highlighted a couple of the crypto industry's less savory funding practices.  First on the list is the widespread custom of allowing early investors whose token allocations are still locked up for another year to stake their tokens now – and in doing so to receive additional tokens that are not locked, i.e. they can be dumped immediately. One exasperated poster on X noted that there are ""MANY token vesting protocols"" out there, and projects could opt to build their own vesting contract, but instead the modus operandi is to ""ask them to 'pretty please don't sell for a while ok?'"" Viktor Bunin, protocol specialist for the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, spoke up to clarify that ""Eigen Labs worked with companies like Toku, Coinbase, and BitGo to distribute tokens. These companies enforce vesting agreements offchain (rather than using onchain vesting contracts)."" He added that, ""This is standard practice - most protocols do this,"" to which one snarky X user responded, ""absolutely cracked that this is considered standard practice in our industry."" For what it's worth, EigenLayer updated its project documentation to disclose that investors are ""not restricted from staking EIGEN,"" and that the ""EIGEN investors receive from staking will not be subject to the lockup schedule."" So at least there's that.  Another knotty topic was the practice of citing project's ""fully diluted value"" as evidence of its worth, when often the ""float"" – consisting of unlocked tokens that are ostensibly free to trade – represents a very small percentage of the total potential supply; in many cases these would not actually be available for trading until some very distant point in the future. As analysts at crypto exchange Binance noted in a report in May, when the float is low, ""tokens can experience rapid price appreciation due to limited liquidity available for trading at launch."" Former CoinDesk reporter Tracy Wang (now at Framework Ventures) wrote in her February 2022 opus on the well-followed crypto trader GCR that his successful ""Big Short"" trade included the very specific strategy of betting against tokens with high fully diluted valuations relative to their float.  In the case of the EigenLayer, a breathless Bankless headline noted that EIGEN had launched at a ""$7B Fully Diluted Value,"" and we did something similar here at CoinDesk, although our Oliver Knight followed quickly afterward with a story highlighting the ""supply concerns,"" noting that the circulating supply had a value of just $650 million. A common complaint, according to the social-media commentator @DefiIgnas, is that EIGEN is a ""VC-funded, low-float, high-FDV token,"" though he quickly added that several other ""similarly branded"" tokens trade at even more ludicrous ratios.

That, in turn, may have reduced the case of Ethereum's ETH token as a compelling investment. (See last week's The Protocol for a glimpse of just what a laggard ETH was during September among members of the CoinDesk 20 index.)  Binance Research has just published its monthly ""Market Insights"" report for October, with the chart above showing the bottom-line impact.  Under Ethereum's monetary rules, higher transactional fees result in more ETH getting burned, but ""as L2s cannibalized network activity throughout the year – further impacted by broader market conditions – transaction fees and, consequently, burned fees on Ethereum declined,"" according to Binance Research.  As a result, ETH is no longer seeing the deflation witnessed on the blockchain earlier this year, and now it appears to be consistently inflationary, with the token's supply steadily increasing.  ""This increase has raised doubts about the 'Ultrasound Money' narrative,"" the analysts wrote. ""For ETH to regain its deflationary status, increased activity on the Ethereum mainnet may be crucial. However, with the growth of L2s, users are increasingly drawn to these scaling solutions due to their improved usability and lower costs.""  Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.  Diagram of Mobius Development Stack, from the project's litepaper (Axelar)  Axelar, a blockchain interoperability project, has launched Mobius Development Stack, described as ""a reimagined Web3 design space,"" according to the team: ""Axelar Mobius Development Stack (MDS), an open interoperability platform for decentralized applications, is live on mainnet. Upcoming L1 launches include Flow, Hedera, Solana, Sui, XRP Ledger. MDS is a new interoperability standard: Advanced token utility, infinite security and scalability."" Sergey Gorbunov, CEO, Interop Labs, said in a statement that ""MDS is the first architecture that scales to support thousands of heterogeneous blockchains.""  Multichain layer-2 network Anduro, incubated by mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), has developed a platform for issuing and investing in real-world assets (RWAs) on Bitcoin. The platform Avant, developed alongside tokenization specialist Vertalo, is planning a pilot project to tokenize whiskey barrels, according to an announcement shared exclusively with CoinDesk.  Polyhedra Network, a blockchain project specializing in zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, released the first set of data from its new Proof Arena, a benchmarking platform designed to evaluate and compare different ZK provers. According to the team, ""The data includes comparisons of provers from Polyhedra, Polygon, Linea and StarkWare – Expander, Plonky3, GNARK, Halo2 respectively. Results: the Expander prover is significantly faster in terms of proof generation time and peak memory; Plonky3 achieves stellar performance in terms of setup and verification time, and GNARK has the smallest proof size.""  Hex Trust, a fully-licensed digital asset custodian with more than $5 billion in assets under custody attained, said it hasjoined forces with Clearpool, a DeFi credit protocol, to launch Ozean, described as ""the blockchain for RWA yield,"" supported by Optimism. According to the team: ""The partnership combines Hex Trust’s industry-leading services, 270-plus institutional clients and regulated infrastructure with Clearpool’s RWA lending expertise to position Ozean as the blockchain to unlock the power of DeFi for RWAs, powered by the CPOOL token.""

42407426,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHS6k,1728496137,How Crypto Reacted to HBO's Big Satoshi 'Reveal',"The history of Satoshi-sleuthing is filled with wrong turns, cul de sacs, and wild goose chases. But HBO's ""MONEY ELECTRIC: THE BITCOIN MYSTERY,"" which aired in the United States Tuesday night, was supposed to be different. It was supposed to provide compelling proof as to who invented Bitcoin, putting the world's greatest mystery to bed, for good.  It didn't.  As soon as leaks emerged Tuesday afternoon that the doc would paint Peter Todd as THE GUY, everyone on X/Twitter with knowledge of the mystery was skeptical. And, on seeing the documentary itself, they were even more skeptical.  Here is a smattering of tweets, reflecting the consensus.  Bitcoin author Eric Yakes had it right:  Coin Center's Neeraj Agrawal:  ""Faketoshi"" Craig Wright, who has claimed to be Satoshi for years, also said the doc was wrong. For once, said Todd, we could agree with him:  @MevenRekt pointed out many inaccuracies in an otherwise well made piece of TV:  Nic Carter had sympathy for bitcoin outsiders:  @Pledditor said the doc showed how Satoshi sleuths have been going about it the wrong way, thinking they were looking for a single well-placed person, when it really could have been many people:  ""This documentary is emblematic of why all of the Satoshi Nakamoto theories are bunk. They all hinge on the belief that only a very small amount of people in the world are capable of building bitcoin, so the theorists just pick a notable person known for their achievements and work backwards retrospectively to find a bunch of ""coincidences"" in their lifestyle/background to support their confirmation bias. It's a broken methodology which results in stalking and unethical doxxing. In reality, the potential amount of people with the profile and background capable of creating bitcoin in 2008 was in the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands. The likelihood that Satoshi was any one of these semi-public figures that regularly get accused of being Satoshi is pretty slim. That's why if you don't have concrete proof, you should probably keep your Satoshi Nakamoto identity theories to yourself. All it does is put a $60 billion dollar bounty on the back of what is (most likely) the wrong person.""  Fortune's Leo Schwartz:  Journalist Izabella Kaminska said we shouldn't be so quick to dismiss the doc's conclusions.

34497520,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647118,1728493215,Hedera Analyst Thinks HBAR Will Easily 30X After Sinking 70% In 6 Months,"Hedera, a proof-of-stake platform, wasn’t spared from aggressive bears in early October. After HBAR, its native token, floated higher in September, the rejection of bulls in early October resulted in a double top. Overall, there is optimism that bulls will resume and push prices to new Q4 2024 highs. The pace of this growth will depend on how the market performs and whether fundamental factors around the project will prop up buyers. Will HBAR Rise By At Least 30X? While there are cracks in the HBAR price action, considering the dump from April highs of around $0.18, one analyst on X thinks the token is set for major gains. From his assessment, Hedera can easily score 30X in the coming sessions, mirroring the gains posted by Cardano in the last cycle. Then, ADA soared by over 170X. If HBAR is to follow the same path, the token can easily soar to $6, over 60X from its 2024 highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Non-Realized Profits Hit Negative Levels—What Does This Mean for Investors? Presently, technical candlestick arrangements favor sellers. After the rally to $0.18 in April 2024, HBAR has been falling. To put the numbers into perspective, the token is down 70% but is stable after finding support in August and September. The local resistance is the double top at around September highs. If prices break above this liquidation zone, HBAR bulls could embark on the journey to drive the coin to $0.18. In effect, this will resume the uptrend set in motion in Q1 2024 and early Q2 2024. Hedera Fundamentals Key To Driving Growth There are fundamental factors to consider that may propel HBAR, helping the token shake off weaknesses. Early this month, Canary Capital released the first United States HBAR Trust. Like Grayscale products, including the ETHE and GBTC, the HBAR Trust allows institutional investors to gain exposure to HBAR. Accordingly, this could drive demand, lifting prices. Related Reading: ETH’s Fate Hinges On $2,300: Will Ethereum Soar To $6,000 Or Dive To $1,600? In September, Hedera launched the Asset Tokenization studio. Through this solution, the network would be at the forefront of driving the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) while adhering to existing laws. Already, BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, believes tokenization will rapidly grow in the coming years, managing trillions. According to rwa.xyz, over $12.7 billion worth of RWAs has been tokenized. Additionally, there is interest. In the last month alone, the number of RWA holders rose to 68,929, a 4% increase. Most of these assets are tokenized on Ethereum and Stellar.

34495734,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647141,1728489624,"Bitcoin Price Crash To $62,000 Was Led By This Holer Cohort, Data Shows","The Bitcoin price is still recovering from a major dip to $60,000 in the first three days of October. As the bulls and long-term holders continue to capitalize on the dip, analysis of on-chain data has revealed that the selling pressure has been eased massively as the majority of short-term holders have exited the market. Interestingly, these short-term holders are accountable for the drop to $60,000, as the data shows many of them exiting the market during the initial decline, further exacerbating the price drop. Short-Term Holders Exit The Market According to an analysis of Bitcoin holder cohorts using data from the CryptoQuant platform, the supply of Bitcoin held by short-term holders has declined substantially since the beginning of the month. Although this contributed to a Bitcoin price decline during this timeframe, it is not necessarily bad for the crypto moving forward. This notable decline is visible in purple bars in the chat below, with every period of price downturns highlighted by an increase in short-term holder selloffs. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Forecasts ADA Price Rocket To $5 The Bitcoin price, which ended September around $65,000, kicked off October with a price dip amidst broader market tensions. This, in turn, led to a 7.5% Bitcoin price dip until it bottomed at $60,100. Notably, the chart highlights that this most recent decline to the $60,000 level coincided with the emergence of more purple bars, revealing that the selloff by short-term holders played a significant role in the price decline. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? Moving forward, the selloff from short-term holders and the price decline has given rise to more accumulation by long-term holders. This, in turn, gives rise to the creation of a price floor around $60,000 in the coming weeks and months. It also marks the shift of more bitcoins to stronger hands who would rather hold than sell. Related Reading: 72% Of ETHUSDT Traders On Binance Go Long – Is This The Buy Signal You Need? Notably, the exit of many short-term holders has given rise to a better average cost for the cohort. According to on-chain metrics revealed by a verified CryptoQuant analyst, the average cost of one to three-month holders is now around $61,633, and the average cost of three to six-month holders is around $64,459. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $62,130, which positions it right in the middle of these two key holder cohorts. According to analyst Burak Kesmeci, a decisive close above the $64,500 level would significantly strengthen the bullish momentum, giving both short and long-term holders more confidence to continue holding. On the other hand, if Bitcoin falls below $61,600, it could trigger a wave of additional selling pressure from more short-term holders, potentially leading to further price declines to revisit $60,000 again.

42407435,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHSTt,1728489600,LatAm Bank Littio Ditches Ethereum for Avalanche as Demand for RWA Vaults Grows,"Littio, a Colombian neobank, is enabling customers to access U.S. Treasury bills through crypto products.  Littio is switching vault holdings from Ethereum (ETH) to Avalanche (AVAX) to scale the products.  Launched in February, the vaults have already garnered $80 million in trading volume.  It’s getting easier for Latin Americans to gain exposure to U.S. Treasury bills.  Colombian neobank Littio is switching blockchain networks – from Ethereum {{ETH}} to Avalanche {{AVAX}} – for products, called Yield Pots, that allow users to earn interest on their U.S. dollar deposits.  Why the change? Growing demand for Yield Pots is forcing the operation to scale. Avalanche’s low transaction fees and consistency were cited as reasons for picking the chain.  The Avalanche Foundation launched a $50 million program last year to incentivize the development of real-world assets (RWAs) on its network and this news is a nice win for the platform.  Demand for U.S. Treasury bills  Littio offers exposure to Yield Pots through its partnership with OpenTrade, a London-based firm that develops yield-bearing products by using stablecoins and real-world assets like U.S. Treasury bills.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay at par with a government-issued currency, typically the U.S. dollar. Real-world assets is a term for assets that exist outside of the crypto ecosystem such as real estate, but are represented on-chain in the form of digital tokens.  “Currently, [Littio] is the only Latin American neobank using [our vaults], but we have more clients set to come online this year offering different types of USDC-based fintech services,” Jeff Handler, chief commercial officer at OpenTrade, told CoinDesk.  “Interested clients are primarily neobanks, centralized exchanges, and payment companies that are already using USDC to fill a gap in demand in USD bank accounts, [USD] payments and [USD] services across Latin America,” Handler added  The company is available in various Latin American countries, including Colombia, Argentina, El Salvador, Brazil and Mexico.  Though Littio’s Yield Pots only launched in February, they have already garnered over $80 million in transaction volume. They have also brought $250,000 in returns to users in the last four months. Littio holds and reinvests between $11 million and $13 million in OpenTrade vaults per month, Handler said.  For comparison, U.S. financial giant Franklin Templeton’s tokenized money market fund – which, quite similarly, allows registered users to gain exposure to U.S. Treasuries – has amassed $435 million in assets since its inception in 2021.  The yield from Littio’s vaults vary between 2% and 5%, according to the company’s website.  It makes sense that the product would attract demand: The Colombian peso is down more than 54% against the U.S. dollar in the last 10 years and has lost 88% since 1990. And it’s not the only Latin American currency facing serious inflation. The dollar looks alluring by contrast.  Depending on where they’re located, Littio customers might also face currency restrictions or a lack of means to open bank accounts through their country’s traditional financial rails — providing them another reason to sign up for Littio.  “Littio and OpenTrade exemplify how Avalanche’s technology can enable underbanked populations to access compelling products and services that are otherwise unavailable or untenable via traditional rails leverage,” said Morgan Krupetsky, head of institutions and capital markets at Ava Labs, which develops the Avalanche blockchain.",POSITIVE,AVAX | ETH,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/09/latam-bank-littio-ditches-ethereum-for-avalanche-as-demand-for-rwa-vaults-grows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa1ede8e61323244ec2761410fd4aec90ae62007-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407427,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHSA3,1728486768,The Shopification of Wealth,"Before Shopify, building and running an e-commerce site was expensive, operationally intensive and a logistical nightmare. Only large retailers could afford to build and operate an online store that could truly serve a large customer base, which made e-commerce seem like a small market. Enter Shopify: by eliminating the supply constraints — enabling anyone with a product to create and scale an online store globally with just a few clicks — they unlocked a huge new market, with a market capitalization of over $100 billion as of today.  Launching, operating, and scaling a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) firm is much harder today than e-commerce ever was, and yet advisors are responsible for managing more than half of all wealth in the United States. As of 2023, there were over 15,000 SEC-registered RIAs managing over $100 trillion in assets. Qualifications and licenses are just a small part of an ever-growing checklist an aspiring financial advisor needs to satisfy in order to go into business.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Wealthtech is incredibly fragmented. Custodians can create lock-ins and impose significant operational, legal, and compliance requirements. Endless layers of intermediaries require additional overhead just to keep the lights on. This is why we've seen increased consolidation in the space, with small RIAs being acquired by larger firms that leverage their existing infrastructure and economies of scale to grow their Assets Under Management (AUM). The generational transfer of wealth from baby boomers to millennials and Gen Z will challenge this strategy. Younger investors are disillusioned by traditional finance. They are digitally native and expect their money and assets to be the same.  With that, wealth management is about to get Shopified. Just as Shopify democratized e-commerce, enabling millions to open online stores, on-chain rails are poised to open up the financial advisory business. According to a survey by Coinbase, 20% of Americans (approximately 52 million people) own cryptocurrency. Experiencing the freedom and power of holding their assets on-chain often changes the way they see off-chain assets — in other words, assets that can only be accessed from legacy platforms. Now for the first time, advisors can work with clients and advise them on assets that always remain under the custody of the client.  Traditional RIAs operate with traditional custodians. For a client to start working with an advisor, they have to assign access or create a new custodial account for their new advisor to manage their assets. By contrast, self-custody introduces a new paradigm where a single wallet can interact with multiple advisors, layering various types of advisory and expertise in the same portfolio. The time-to-advice is reduced from weeks to minutes, as assets can be viewed non-custodially, and discretionary abilities can be granted with a single, on-chain signature.  Tokenized assets: the online SKUs of the financial world  Tokenized assets are transforming the investment landscape, much like SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) revolutionized retail inventory management. Tokenization allows for fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and soon, access to any asset class on-chain. In a world where your entire universe of investable products is one wallet signature away, service providers can focus less on operational hurdles and more on generating alpha, protection, and growth for their clients. Similarly this opens the door for asset managers to go direct-to-consumer.  We are about to see a new breed of RIAs coming on-chain to increasingly serve this growing crypto-native clientele. Much like anyone can now start an e-commerce site with Shopify, any licensed and competent financial professional will be able to advise clients on-chain. The winners will be the investors, who will have an open, transparent, and verifiable world of expert advice to choose from, or combine, to best suit their financial goals and needs.

42407467,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHSnj,1728486745,"For Millennials, Bitcoin Is the New Real Estate","Real estate as an asset class has been a source of increasing affluence as many older individuals in top-tier Asian cities, such as Singapore and Hong Kong, have seen their wealth soar due to rising property values. While some members of these generations may be cash-poor, they often have substantial assets, primarily in real estate.  In Hong Kong, for instance, parents who fully own their property are likely to be millionaires already, even if it's just a tiny one-bedroom apartment. However, for younger generations, including millennials and Gen Z, the ultra-high property prices aren’t just a challenge — they’re a significant financial burden. Many of these owners are weighed down with long-term mortgages that have high interest rates, and are thus struggling to ascend the social ladder. In other words, rapid urbanization means that younger individuals are unlikely to build the same level of wealth through real estate as their once parents did.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Even though accumulating wealth through real estate may no longer be realistic for young adults, many of them still consider this their only choice, as there aren’t too many obvious alternatives. Some simply can't keep up as the real estate market continues to inflate in various Asian cities. Soon, they’ll find themselves in a downward financial spiral.  Amid this dilemma, some experts advocate for alternative investments such as bitcoin. Viewed as a form of “virtual real estate,” bitcoin presents a unique opportunity for younger investors: with a capped supply of 21 million units, bitcoin is rarer than most real estate options. Its highly liquid market allows investors to trade BTC anytime they want, without the barriers associated with property ownership and hefty down payments. This makes bitcoin an intriguing investment option.  In each generation, wealth is often transformed and redistributed, and bitcoin could play a pivotal role in this transition. Data indicates that younger people, driven by their tech savviness, are generally more open to cryptocurrency investments.This generational shift suggests that bitcoin may be crucial for the process of transferring wealth from older generations to younger ones.  Source: Crypto Investment Literacy Report presented by Bybit  Bitcoin represents a new frontier for wealth accumulation among younger generations. Instead of pursuing increasingly expensive real estate, younger investors might consider allocating funds to bitcoin.  It's crucial, however, to approach this investment with a long-term mindset — that is, with an intention to hold onto bitcoin, much like one would with residential property — rather than to engage in speculative trading. This responsible and prudent approach is key to building enduring wealth in an increasingly challenging financial landscape.

Mahmudov has reportedly transformed an initial investment of just $2 into a fortune exceeding $100 million over the past five years. This astounding feat was detailed by Pix (@PixOnChain), an advisor to Mintify and researcher at Jirasan, and further analyzed by crypto analyst Rekt Fencer (@rektfencer) on X. This is Murad In 2020, he went bankrupt during the COVID crash Now, he’s a memecoin whale, making MILLIONS every day Here’s how he did it — and what he thinks is coming next 👇🧵 pic.twitter.com/jqv0pS2PT1 — Rekt Fencer (@rektfencer) October 8, 2024 From Bitcoin To Crypto To Memecoins Murad Mahmudov’s entry into the world of cryptocurrency began in 2013 while he was an exchange student in China. Surrounded by forward-thinking peers deeply invested in Bitcoin, he developed an early interest in digital assets. After a period working with financial giants Goldman Sachs and Glencore, Mahmudov returned to the crypto sphere in 2016, fully embracing the role of a Bitcoin maximalist. In 2018, he made headlines with a bold prediction: Bitcoin would reach $10 million per coin. This assertion was considered audacious even among staunch Bitcoin advocates. Despite his Bitcoin-centric philosophy, Mahmudov was quietly accumulating altcoins, including Ethereum at $150. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst: Why Memecoins Are Still The Next 100x Opportunity Capitalizing on his market insights, Mahmudov co-founded Adaptive Capital in 2019 alongside several colleagues. The fund initially outperformed expectations, leveraging a formula that seemed to consistently beat the market. However, the unforeseen global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 dramatically shifted the economic landscape. With significant long positions in Bitcoin, Adaptive Capital faced catastrophic losses as exchanges experienced outages during critical trading periods. The fund ultimately closed, returning the remaining capital to investors after sustaining a 55% loss. This pivotal moment prompted Mahmudov to reassess his investment strategies. Taking a hiatus from active trading, he re-emerged in June 2022 with a renewed perspective on the crypto market. The Memecoin Supercycle Recognizing emerging trends, Mahmudov shifted his focus to memecoins. He introduced the concept of the “Memecoin Supercycle,” positing that these tokens represent the next significant growth opportunity in the crypto market. Related Reading: RIP Altcoin Seasons? Crypto Analyst Debates Whether They’ll Ever Return In a viral post on September 12, Mahmudov unveiled his top ten high-conviction memecoin investments, complete with ambitious long-term market capitalization targets. Among them were tokens like SPX6900 SSPX on Ethereum, which he believes could reach a $100 billion market cap, asserting it as the “number one movement coin in the world” with a mission to “flip the stock market.” His predictions were met with skepticism, with some labeling him as overly optimistic. However, his conviction remains unshaken. “I’ve spent the last 10 weeks locked in my room doing nothing but studying Memecoins, silently hanging out in their groupchats, simply observing and studying their lore to develop conviction on my Top 10 long-term Memecoin plays. I will be sharing all 10 over the next 10 days,” he writes. Mahmudov’s insights gained significant traction following his recent presentation at Token2049. According to Mechanism Capital’s Andrew Kang his talk at Token2049 “catalyzed the next wave of capital reallocation into memecoins.” Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher summarized the key points of Mahmudov’s speech, noting the exceptional performance of memecoins in the current market cycle. Mahmudov emphasized that “assets will no longer move up in unison,” highlighting the distinct outperformance of memecoins compared to traditional altcoins. Murad’s recent speech at TOKEN2049 has ignited a memecoin frenzy. It will change your ENTIRE outlook on crypto (and could net you huge gains). If you haven’t watched it yet, you NEED to read this thread. 🧵: Breaking down @MustStopMurad‘s memecoin theory.👇 — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) October 8, 2024 He argued that memecoins fulfill retail investors’ desires for community, identity, and excitement—elements often missing from utility-focused altcoins. “Memecoins as a superior version of altcoins,” Mahmudov asserted. “Memecoins are outpacing altcoins by delivering what retail actually craves: community, identity, and excitement, not just potential gains. It’s not just speculation, it’s culture, Deutscher explained. At press time, leading Solana based memecoin WIF traded at $2.52, up 75% in the last three weeks.

Instead, the company has two ongoing tokenization projects focusing on tokenizing a bond and a money market fund, which will take the company ""through part of next year,” Milrod said. The aim is to build tokenized collateral that would allow traders to use as margin, without the need to liquidate their holdings to post cash.  Traditional finance heavyweights and global banks are getting increasingly involved in the tokenization of traditional financial instruments, or real-world assets (RWA), placing bonds, funds, credit or commodities onto blockchain rails. The process promises operational benefits such as increased efficiency, faster and around-the-clock settlements and lower administrative costs.  ""Operational efficiency alone, that’s not enough. It needs to be something commercial,"" Milrod said in the interview. ""The industry is figuring out where the commercial value is.""  Milrod added that collateral tokens could have helped avoid or lessen, for example, the ""liability-driven"" crisis in 2022, where pension funds could have used money market fund tokens for margin calls instead of liquidating their assets to raise cash.  State Street has also been growing its presence in the digital asset industry, selecting Switzerland-based Taurus as a tokenization partner, CoinDesk reported in August.

Related Reading: Analyst Foresees 90% Cardano Price Drop in Next 6 Months According to the on-chain tracker Lookonchain, a wallet linked to the foundation moved 2,500 ETH, valued around $6 million, to the exchange Bitstamp on October 8, 2024. This is part of an increasing trend in which large holders, colloquially known as “whales,” are selling their holdings in the face of this volatile market environment. A whale deposited 11,456 $ETH($27.8M) to #Binance in the past 40 minutes!https://t.co/0L5r2u9wF9 pic.twitter.com/gNZI3pKAEx — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 8, 2024 Significant Transactions Uncovered Lookonchain claims this is not the only transaction this foundation has lately done. ETH sold overall in 2024 is as high as 3,766, which brought $10.46 million. The organization sold 950 ETH in September, equal to $2.27 million. They sell them often, roughly every 11 days. The transaction averages about 151 ETH in size. The foundation still retains a significant sum: 271,274 ETH, or about $655 million. Market Reactions And Jitters The crypto community has a reason to worry over the continuous selling of Ethereum. Much of the investors have severely feared that this huge liquidation might lead to downward pressure on ETH prices. During the last 14 days, the price of Ethereum went down by around 8%. This has led some analysts to speculate that these selling events are contributing factors behind the bearish market of ETH. Community commentators are divided between interest and concern regarding the history of the wallet by the foundation, how it affects the market dynamics, Lookonchain has disclosed. Related Reading: Cardano Surges In Strength—Now 10x More Powerful, Analyst Says Future Financial Planning Such sales, according to Aya Miyaguchi, an executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, are part of a deliberate financial strategy – working to pay for operational costs and cover the costs of ongoing projects. The entire annual budget is estimated to be around $100 million, with some of these costs – such as salaries and grants – requiring fiat currency. Thus, turning part of the ETH reserve into stablecoins like DAI has become routine. With the Ethereum Foundation still working through its financial situation in a volatile market, only time will tell how these continued sales will affect both the price of ETH and the robustness of the Ethereum ecosystem. With quite a bit of resources still locked up by the foundation, individuals are paying close attention to look for changes or constructive/violent reactions in the market.

42407422,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHRwp,1728479290,India's Crypto Discussion Paper on Hold Due to Other Priorities,"India has yet to release a discussion paper on crypto, which was expected to be published by September.  Other matters, like this month's World Bank meetings, have taken priority over stakeholder consultations, which are crucial to framing India's crypto policy stance.  India has yet to publish a discussion paper outlining its policy stance on cryptocurrencies because officials are concentrating on other priorities, according to two people familiar with the decision.  The document was initially expected by September following consultations with stakeholders including the central bank and the markets regulator. The intention to publish remains, but there is no timeline, said the people, who requested anonymity because the delay hasn't been announced publicly.  India, the world's fifth-largest economy, does not have comprehensive crypto legislation and the discussion paper was expected to be a step in that direction. The nation says crypto is unregulated, though it has imposed stiff taxes on the sector and introduced a requirement for crypto entities to be registered with the country's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND) to adhere to anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorism financing standards set by global bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  Officials within India's policy environment faced more pressing demands, including the 2024 annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank at the end of this month. They have also had to deal with a number of multilateral and bilateral meetings with other nations as two regional wars – between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and its enemies in the Middle East – persist.  Additionally, the Finance Ministry has had to concentrate on an election year with two budgets, an interim one in February before the July vote and a full budget afterward, together with resulting consultations across the country.  Despite a $234 million hack of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, the authorities do not consider crypto legislation a burning issue like it was two years ago, the people suggested.

New Bitcoin Whales Are About To Overtake Old Ones In a new post on X, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has discussed the recent trend in the Realized Caps of the new and old Bitcoin whales. The “Realized Cap” here is a model that calculates the total valuation of Bitcoin by assuming that each coin’s ‘true’ value in circulation is the price at which it was last transferred or sold on the blockchain. The last transfer of any coin is likely the last point at which it changes hands, so the price at its time could be equated to its current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap measures the sum of the cost basis of the BTC supply. Or, put another way, this metric keeps track of the total amount of capital the investors have put into BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Nears 20%: Could This Trigger A Fresh Surge? In the context of the current topic, the version of the Realized Cap that’s of interest is limited to just two segments of the market: the new and old whales. Whales refer to entities carrying more than 1,000 coins in their wallets. This cohort is divided into two based on age using a 155-day cutoff. All whales bought within the past five months belong to the short-term holder or new whale cohort, while those who have been holding for longer than this duration are called the long-term holder or old whales. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the relative percentages of the Realized Cap contributed by these two Bitcoin groups: As the above graph shows, the Realized Cap of the new Bitcoin whales wasn’t anything significant before 2018, indicating that veteran capital was king on the network. Following 2018, though, the percentage dominance of this group gradually started to show an improvement. And this year, the growth in the Realized Cap of this cohort has blown up, with the metric’s value now sitting at $108 billion. For perspective, the indicator is standing at $113 billion for the old whales, which suggests the disparity between the two almost nonexistent. “Bitcoin whales are experiencing a generational shift,” notes Young Ju, based on this trend. “Realized Cap of new whales is expected to surpass that of older whales soon.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Not Sold On Uptober As Sentiment Remains Neutral As for the sudden sharp growth in the Realized Cap of the new whales, it’s likely that the inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been falling in this category. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $62,200, down more than 2% over the past week.

Bitcoin's resilience and quick recovery from market dips highlight its potential as a rewarding investment in various market conditions. Despite inherent risks, spot Bitcoin ETFs like BITB offer safer exposure compared to direct Bitcoin ownership, mitigating custody and theft concerns. Bitwise's expansion into other crypto ETPs and the European market will likely boost its AuM and maintain low fees, enhancing its market position. Following the approval of the spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs in January, I considered the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ), as one of the top picks among the spot Bitcoin ETFs because it has one of the lowest fees and the first six months fee waiver was also an attraction for the ETF. Bitwise’s experience in creating and managing crypto funds was also appealing. To top it all off, Bitwise was the first fund to publish the on-chain wallet addresses , showcasing a commitment to transparency that aligns perfectly with the tenets of blockchain technology. Bitwise is becoming a crypto ETFs frontrunner and has just become the first fund to file for a spot XRP ETF ( XRP-USD). ETF Central (BITB vs IBIT tracking performance) BITB has expanded since launch and now commands $2.36 billion in AuM and sits in mid-tier range among the spot Bitcoin ETF funds. The largest spot Bitcoin ETF fund, Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), is about 10x bigger at $22.51 billion. BITB has been a reliable mid-sized fund and has shown a strong tracking performance. Compared to IBIT with a -0.20 bps tracking difference, BITB shows a -0.14 bps tracking difference. As a mid-tier fund, there is potentially a balance between liquidity and efficient trade execution for BITB. By efficient trade execution, I mean BITB’s ability to buy and sell Bitcoin in response to inflows and outflows with minimal market impact, reducing price slippage and keeping transaction costs low. Like the other spot ETFs, BITB performance is directly tied to how Bitcoin performs; hence, a close look at Bitcoin’s price trend and overall market behavior gives valuable insights into the broader outlook of BITB (and the other spot Bitcoin ETFs). Bitcoin Resilience is at an All-Time High Bitcoin is perceived (especially by Bitcoin maxis ) to be mostly uncorrelated to the general financial market; however, the reality is that every asset is influenced by broader macroeconomic forces, and Bitcoin is no exception. Investors who were active in crypto during the last market cycle (in 2020) would remember the COVID black swan that sent Bitcoin crashing by over 60% in just a week, from $10,500 to $3,800. BTC would go on to surge by ~1,700% from its COVID-era low to hit a ~$69,000 high in 2021. The Block The preceding chart shows the daily net flows of the spot Bitcoin ETFs since launch to date. And as we can see, there have been days with recorded steep negative net flows. Heavy outflows were recorded on May 1, this year, as the ETF funds saw $-563.7 million in outflows and net flows, breaking the outflow record as of that date. The negative sentiment was directly linked to the Fed's rate cut decision , as many investors had speculated a rate hike. The Fed decided to hold the rate steady between 5.25% and 5.5% and a rate hike in the near future was ruled out. Following this announcement , net flows became positive again, and the spot ETFs witnessed a total of $378.3 million in net flows. One characteristic that Bitcoin has exhibited since it became a well-known asset is its growing resilience. This same resilience has been shown in the inflows recorded by the spot Bitcoin ETFs since they launched. Demand for the spot Bitcoin ETFs has, in fact, added to Bitcoin's resilience and the price rebound we've seen in the events of the August carry trade FUD, the German government Bitcoin sell-off FUD in July, during the fears of Mt. Gox reimbursement estate sell-off, and after the recent dips caused by the middle-East conflict which ricocheted throughout the traditional and crypto markets. And Bitcoin’s swift rebound makes it two steps away from being the decoupled and safe-haven asset that it is perceived to be. The point of highlighting Bitcoin’s recent dips and comebacks in this article is to illustrate Bitcoin’s market resilience to investors and to point out why gaining crypto exposure could be a wise move at this stage of the crypto market cycle and amidst the current geopolitical tensions and broader macro outlook. Bitcoin and its derivative products and investment vehicles are beginning to offer a win-win for investors. Because on the one hand, its proven ability to recover quickly from downturns and surpass previous highs provides a level of resilience that benefits investors in unfavorable market conditions, and on the other hand, Bitcoin also performs exceptionally well in a favorable macro environment. A good example of this is Bitcoin’s recent surge following the Fed’s 50 bps rate cut last month. These dual strengths make Bitcoin a potentially rewarding investment in different market conditions. In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine - Benjamin Graham Short-term volatility could be disconcerting for traditional investors, I, however, remain bullish on Bitcoin and the spot ETFs performance in the medium to long-term. I believe that the catalyst that the Bitcoin post-halving supply cut brings is still much in play, as we've seen Bitcoin rebounding above the $60,000 support on major dips since the halving. Risks Bitcoin exposure comes with certain risks, and one of the wells talked-about risks is the volatility the asset and its investment vehicles exhibit. Also, the risk of asset loss or theft is notably higher in crypto and its related products compared to traditional investments. This risk has, however, been mitigated through gaining exposure through a spot Bitcoin ETF like BITB compared to directly owning Bitcoin and self-custody, as Bitwise takes care of the Bitcoin custody for investors. This is one of the advantages the ETFs hold over owning Bitcoin directly. Bottom Line With Bitcoin showing resilience by swift recovering from dips, consistent inflows into the spot ETFs, and growth of the AuM of the spot ETF funds - except for Grayscale ( GBTC ) which has recorded shrinking AuM due to its inordinate 2.5% fee - Bitcoin exposure should be a no-brainer for risk-tolerant investors. There is currently no safer or more direct medium to gain such exposure than through spot Bitcoin ETFs. After ten months since launch and showing good tracking performance and steady AuM growth, I reiterate that the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF is a great choice to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin. Bitwise is bound to see its total AuM and market standing steadily increase because of its expansion into other crypto ETPs. Bitwise now owns the largest physical Bitcoin ETP, the ET32 Ethereum staking ETP, and the ESOL Solana physical ETP, among others, as it acquired the European crypto ETP provider , ETC Group, in August. This expansion into the European market and diversification into other ETPs will not only increase Bitwise's total AuM but potentially lead to better economies of scale, which will help the fund maintain its low fees in the long term.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4725797-bitwise-etf-bitb-still-a-great-vehicle-for-direct-bitcoin-exposure?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34489929.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,918.40 -0.63%  Bitcoin (BTC): $62,086.59 -0.68%  Ether (ETH): $2,431.18 -0.10%  S&P 500: 5,751.13 +0.97%  Gold: $2,621.91 -0.01%  Nikkei 225: 39,277.96 +0.87%  Top Stories  The crypto market was little changed following a hotly awaited HBO documentary that promised to shed new light on the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. ""Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery"" identified Bitcoin developer Peter Todd as the cryptocurrency's pseudonymous creator, a claim Todd had denied even before the broadcast. Positive developments in revealing Satoshi's true identity could, in theory, be a volatility-boosting event for crypto markets. However, HBO's attempt, like all previous ones, proved unfruitful. Bitcoin trades at around $62,150, a drop of about 0.45% in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, was also little changed.  Spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded a cumulative outflow of over $18 million on Monday, SoSoValue data show. Ether ETFs recorded over $8 million in withdrawals. Low volatility in BTC came after a lack of new measures and announcements of new stimulus at a Chinese briefing on Tuesday pared hopes of a long-drawn stimulus package, which had contributed to a bitcoin run in the past few weeks. Stocks in China are deep in the red, with the Shanghai Composite Index down 3.9% and Shenzhen’s Component Index down 4%. Traders, meanwhile, look toward upcoming notes from the September Federal Reserve meeting for clues on where BTC might move next.  A large bitcoin options trade anticipates a shift from the present low-volatility regime to a period of heightened price swings, potentially exceeding the $53,000-$87,000 range. The trade saw the entity pay a net premium of over $1 million to purchase 100 contracts of the $66,000 strike call and put options expiring on Nov. 29, according to data confirmed by Lin Chen, head of business development Asia at Deribit. A long straddle is preferred when the market is expected to move far enough in either direction to make the call or the put option worth more than the cumulative premium paid. For the strategy to turn profitable and overcompensate for the premium paid, the bitcoin price needs to move either above $87,000 or below $53,000 by the end of November, Chen told CoinDesk.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the total amount of outstanding loans provided by prime brokerages to hedge funds.  The tally has risen to over $2 trillion, posing a risk to financial stability, according to Apollo's chief economist, Torsten Sløk.

Over the past month alone, SUI has increased by more than 100%, with its 7-day performance still seeing green up by 11.8% after nearly touching its all-time high of $2.17 yesterday with a 24-hour high of $2.13. Although the asset is currently facing a price decline down by 4.3% in the past 24 hours with a current trading price of $1.99, a prominent crypto analyst known as CryptoBullet has taken to his X account to address investors on whether now is the best time to sell SUI. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand Should You Sell Your SUI Now? While it may seem tempting for some to sell during this price dip, CryptoBullet suggests otherwise. The analyst noted, “I know it might be tempting to sell SUI here, but it’s the wrong timing imo [in my opinion].” The analyst explained that the crypto is experiencing its fourth test of the $2 level, a key technical point, adding that “the more times a level is tested, the more likely it is to break.” CryptoBullet believes this could indicate a bullish breakout, pointing to the formation of a Cup and Handle pattern. Additionally, CryptoBullet highlighted some of SUI’s achievements that could further propel its bullish case. These include a market cap that nearly reached $6 billion, a transaction per second (TPS) rate exceeding 1,000 for the past three days, and SUI ranking as the second-largest non-EVM chain by total value locked (TVL) at $1.08 billion. Strong Growth Ahead For Ecosystem? Another crypto analyst known as ‘Easy’ on X echoed CryptoBullet’s optimism, comparing SUI’s potential to Solana’s meteoric rise in 2021. According to the analyst, “Sleeping on SUI is like sleeping on SOL in 2021.” He emphasized that SUI’s metrics, including TVL and trading volume, are showing strong growth, which could indicate that the crypto is poised for a significant bull run. Related Reading: Can SUI Fall To $1.40?

34487315,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646997,1728471644,Bitcoin Price Surge In 2024 Not Enough To Beat Gold’s Risk-Adjusted Returns – Details Here,"According to Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin (BTC) price appreciation in 2024 failed to compensate for its price volatility risks. Meanwhile, gold’s higher risk-adjusted returns reaffirmed its “safe haven” narrative. Despite The Gains, Bitcoin Fails To Outshine Gold The leading digital asset by reported market cap surged from roughly $42,000 at the beginning of the year to as high as $73,000 in March 2024, recording more than 73% gains. At its current market price of $62,790, BTC is still more than 40% up from its price in January 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation With Gold Now At Highest Level Since March Notably, throughout 2024, Bitcoin has consistently outperformed major equity indices, fixed-income instruments, gold, and crude oil. However, according to data tracked by Goldman Sachs, despite BTC’s impressive gains, its price performance in absolute terms fails to compensate for its volatility. The analysis by Goldman Sachs puts BTC’s year-to-date (YTD) volatility ratio at just under 2%. In comparison, gold gave a risk-adjusted return of 3%, posting strong 28% gains in absolute terms. For the uninitiated, the volatility ratio measures the return an asset generates for each unit of risk or volatility it carries. A higher ratio indicates that an asset provides better returns relative to the risk taken, while a lower ratio suggests less efficient performance. The analysis notes that Bitcoin’s volatility ratio was only better than Ethereum’s native ETH token, S&P GSCI Energy Index, and Japan’s TOPIX index among the non-fixed income growth-sensitive investments. Bitcoin’s low volatility ratio compared to gold cements the latter’s claim as a “safe haven asset.” This came under the limelight last week when BTC slumped, and gold surged following Iran’s offensive against Israel. Still A Long Way To Go For Bitcoin Since its inception following the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin’s ascent to a trillion-dollar market cap asset has been remarkable. The fixed supply of 21 million, decentralized network architecture, and halving every four years make BTC an appealing asset. However, the market cap gap between Bitcoin and gold remains vast. That said, several crypto analysts are confident that Bitcoin will outperform the shining metal in the coming years. For instance, seasoned analyst Peter Brandt recently made an ambitious prediction that by 2025, BTC could see its price jump 400% relative to gold. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Brink Of Massive Breakout Like Gold In 2008: Hedge Fund CEO Similarly, in August 2024, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck stated that BTC could surge to $350,000 on the back of greater adoption. Most recently, investment management firm BlackRock declared Bitcoin a “gold alternative” due to its fixed supply and increasing investor confidence in its ability to tackle inflation and avoid value erosion during uncertain times. On the contrary, billionaire Ray Dalio has expressed his opinion on the Bitcoin vs. gold narrative, saying that BTC will never fully replace gold. BTC trades at $62,790 at press time, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours.

42390213,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbtXpb,1728471368,Whale Alert: $1M BTC Trade Bets on Volatility Expansion Outside $53K-$87K Range,"A large long BTC straddle crossed the tape on Deribit, betting on a volatility explosion by the end of November.  To be profitable, the options strategy needs prices to move above $87,000 or below $53,000 by expiry.  A large bitcoin {{BTC}} options trade executed on Deribit early Wednesday anticipates a shift from the present low volatility regime to a period of heightened price swings, potentially exceeding the $53,000-$87,000 range.  The trade, a so-called long straddle, saw the entity pay a net premium of over $1 million to purchase 100 contracts of the $66,000 strike call and put options expiring on Nov. 29, according to data confirmed by Lin Chen, head of business development Asia at Deribit.  A long straddle is preferred when the market is expected to move far enough in either direction to make the call or the put option worth more than the cumulative premium paid. A call option protects the buyer against price rallies and gains value as the underlying asset's price rises. A put works the other way around, gaining value as prices drop.  ""When discussing strangles, straddles, and ratioed straddle strategies, it is necessary to understand the buying and selling of 'premium' [options contracts],"" options trader Charles M. Cottle wrote in his book ""Options Trading: The Hidden Reality."" ""Sellers of premium want the market to sit still, and buyers of premium [straddle/strangle buyers] want the market to move.""  For the strategy to turn profitable and overcompensate for the premium paid, the bitcoin price needs to move either above $87,000 or below $53,000 by the end of November, Chen told CoinDesk.  In other words, it is a bet on volatility explosion beyond the $53,000-$87,000 range. The trade will bleed money if the price remains between those levels till the end of November, with the maximum loss being the $1 million premium paid.  Chen said that November expiry options are seeing above-normal activity, likely in anticipation of a potential post-U.S. election volatility. The U.S. presidential election is due Nov. 5, with results to be declared on Nov. 8. Some traders have recently set up bets on continued range play ahead of the elections.  ""We have over $1.4 billion open interest in BTC's end-of-November expiry and a put-call ratio of 0.66, which is notably higher than usual. In comparison, the December put-call ratio is 0.39,"" Chen told CoinDesk.

The company mined 703 BTC in Q3, with 242 BTC added to their treasury, totaling 1,147 BTC worth $71.1 million. With major overhangs seemingly resolved, it's an opportune time to reassess Bitfarms' investment thesis. Dilution remains an ongoing concern. To call it an 'unusual' summer for Bitfarms ( BITF ) would likely be an understatement. Here's a list of the things that have happened since I last covered the stock in mid-May: A hostile takeover attempt by mining peer Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) Ben Gagnon became the company's 4th CEO since 2022 A Board of Directors shakeup The company bought Stronghold Digital Mining ( SDIG ) in a stock-for-stock merger When I covered BITF back in May, I specifically mentioned the leadership question marks going forward as a cause for concern. Those concerns have been mitigated. In my opinion, Gagnon is a good choice for CEO given his previous role as the company's Chief Mining Officer and his CEO experience prior to joining Bitfarms. In addition to that, Bitfarms announced the company reached a settlement with former-CEO Geoffrey Morphy. While the Riot takeover attempt was not something that was on my radar in mid-May, I do think the short-term conclusion of that fiasco is a good thing. I suspect most of the major overhangs for BITF shareholders are presumably in the rearview mirror. Thus, I think it's a good time to revisit the thesis for BITF. In this update, we'll look at recent production numbers, stock performance versus peers, and valuation considerations. Q3 Production & Mining Data Monthly Production (Bitfarms, Author's Chart) Between July and September, Bitfarms mined 703 Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) at an average of about 10.3 EH/s during the quarter. Approximately 242 of those coins have been 'banked' via the company's BTC treasury holdings. Monthly BTC Holdings (Bitfarms, Author's Chart) Currently, Bitfarms' 1,147 BTC stack has a market value of $71.1 million. This is in addition to the $73 million in cash the company reported having at the end of September. Mining economics are still a concern for all Bitcoin miners: Bitcoin's USD Hashprice (Hashrateindex) The average USD-denominated hash price so far in October has been about $44.50 per PH/s. This is an important metric for Bitcoin mining stock shareholders to reference because it shows the broad profitability of the industry. While the USD hash price is off the August low of $35, the industry is still clearly feeling the impact of April's block reward halving. Miner Reward Distribution (IntoTheBlock) Transaction fees have simply not been a meaningful driver of revenue for Bitcoin miners over the last three or four months. Despite what I view to be obvious fundamental issues for the industry broadly, Bitfarms stock specifically has been a laggard among public equity miners since the beginning of the year. BITF Performance vs Peers It's been a mixed bag for the mining industry since the start of the year, in the chart below I'm showing Bitfarms against similarly sized peers by market capitalization, Marathon Digital ( MARA ), and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ): Data by YCharts Of our sample, BITF has performed the worst at a 35% year to date loss. MARA is somewhat close at a 32% loss. RIOT has actually been the worst YTD performer in the space of any company with at least $100 million in market capitalization. Mining Stock Performances (Seeking Alpha) BITF's year to date performance comes in second worst after RIOT. I suspect the failed takeover attempt has hurt RIOT shareholders more than BITF shareholders to this point due to the fact that RIOT has piled so much capital into BITF shares as part of the company's takeover plan. However, there is certainly an AI/HPC angle on display here as well. The out-performance of WGMI is very interesting and likely indicative of the market rewarding Bitcoin miners that have prioritized HPC efforts over just Bitcoin mining business lines. I explored this a bit more in my recent WGMI article from September: At least five of the top seven companies in the fund are openly trying to build an HPC/AI compute segment in addition to BTC mining. Furthermore, the top company in the industry by market capitalization is only the 8th largest holding in the fund. Thus, it would appear that a bet on WGMI is becoming just as much of a play on HPC data centers as it is Bitcoin miners. For Bitfarms, the commitment to new revenue streams outside of Bitcoin mining was hinted at earlier this summer. And doubt about that now seems to be a thing of the past based on recent comments from Gagnon: We remain focused on diversifying the business beyond Bitcoin mining into exciting and synergistic new areas like energy generation, energy trading, heat recycling and other high value revenue streams like HPC/AI. My read on the situation is essentially this; Bitcoin miners have increasingly realized it takes AI/HPC commitments to move the needle on share price. Since most of these companies generally raise capital through dilution, higher share prices are a benefit to existing shareholders as it minimizes growth in shares outstanding. Now that Bitfarms is more overtly signaling HPC intentions, I believe the market will regain interest. Valuation & Breakeven Price Miner Valuations (Seeking Alpha) From a valuation standpoint, I would actually say BITF is on the cheaper side relative to peers with similar liquidity, though there may be good reason for that. Of the top ten public mining companies ranked by recently reported cash holdings, Bitfarms trades at the second-lowest price to sales multiple and is competitive in both P/B and long term debt to total capital. The company has the 8th largest HODL stack should BTC liquidity need to be accessed. Going forward, I think shareholders really need to see efficiency metrics improve if Bitfarms is ever going to return value to shareholders as a business. In the table below, I'm showing two years of quarterly break-even price data based on (COGS + Opex) divided by BTC mined: Cost of Revenues Total Opex BTC Mined Break-even Price Q3-22 $37,200,000 $10,300,000 1,515 $31,353 Q4-22 $39,100,000 $12,000,000 1,435 $35,610 Q1-23 $38,400,000 $8,400,000 1,297 $36,083 Q2-23 $41,500,000 $12,200,000 1,223 $43,908 Q3-23 $43,500,000 $8,400,000 1,172 $44,283 Q4-23 $44,500,000 $10,400,000 1,236 $44,417 Q1-24 $42,500,000 $13,200,000 943 $59,067 Q2-24 $52,800,000 $12,400,000 614 $106,189 TTM $183,300,000 $44,400,000 3,965 $57,427 Source: Seeking Alpha, Bitfarms, Author's Calculations We can see the long-term trend has been a rising break-even price. The Q2 figure is highly alarming as it takes a $106k BTC price for Bitfarms to breakeven judging from the post-halving data that we have at our disposal. We'll likely get a much better idea of how the company's mining breakeven is progressing when we see the company's Q3 earnings report. But I'm admittedly not expecting much improvement there based on the comparable number of BTC mined to Q2 and what I'd imagine is a much higher COGS figure based on monthly EH/s numbers between July and September. Closing Thoughts Raising capital via the ATM and diluting shareholders can't be the only way this company survives long term. At a certain point, the business will have to be self-sustaining or there is very little reason to hold shares in the company's equity. Given that, as a long-term investment, I still can't get there on BITF. Perhaps if the company can legitimately build out a meaningful HPC business line, I'll entertain changing my mind. However, as a short-term trade, I think there is possible upside to taking a position here if one expects the price of BTC to rise. And I do expect BTC to increase in price between now and the end of the year. The best ways to express that thesis would perhaps be owning BTC directly, spot ETFs, or through a leveraged proxy like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). But beyond that, the miners historically offer significantly larger short-term returns if traders can time their moves well. I expect the price of BTC to rise and yield a higher USD-denominated hash price. That's typically good for mining equities. Riot Platforms is sort of trapped in its sizable BITF investment while takeover talks have hit a standstill through Bitfarms' 2026 Annual Meeting. Given Riot's position as a major holder, the company likely can't sell out now as it would depress the price and run counter to its own interests. Finally, judging by the resurgence in NVIDIA ( NVDA ) stock over the last month, the market still loves a good AI story. We can now add BITF to the long list of Bitcoin miners-turned HPC data center builders.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4725771-bitfarms-buy-the-takeover-truce?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34486501.jpeg

Ethereum Rally To $6,000 If $2,300 Support Holds Ethereum has fallen 7% in the past two weeks, with a key support level now at $2,300. This support is crucial for bullish investors hoping for a resurgence that could push ETH to new all-time highs. According to technical analyst Ali Martinez, this moment is pivotal for Ethereum’s future price trajectory. Martinez suggests that if ETH can maintain its support above $2,300, a rally toward $6,000 might be on the horizon. Such a surge would significantly increase, surpassing Ethereum’s previous all-time peak of $4,878 in November 2021. If this bullish scenario plays out, it could translate to a substantial 150% increase from current trading levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: This Week’s Trends And Historical Patterns For Q4 Conversely, if Ethereum fails to hold above the $2,300 support level in the short term, Martinez warns that ETH’s price could drop to around $1,600. This would signify a decline of nearly 34% from current levels, exacerbating the losses experienced during previous market corrections on August 5 and September 6, when ETH fell by more than 20% on each occasion. The potential loss of the $2,000 mark would also be particularly significant, marking a psychological barrier that has not been breached since November 2023. This time frame corresponds with a broader market uptrend that continued until the end of the first quarter of 2024, underscoring the importance of the $2,300 support level for Ethereum’s bullish outlook. ETH Underperforms Broader Crypto Market In addition to the absence of bullish catalysts for the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market, CoinGecko data indicates a notable lack of investor engagement. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) recorded a trading volume of only 5%, amounting to $14 billion. Moreover, Ethereum is currently underperforming compared to the broader cryptocurrency market, which has risen nearly 3%. In contrast, ETH’s price has declined by almost 6% over the past week, with losses exceeding 2% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Options Set To Supercharge Price Volatility, Expert Warns This price stagnation may be linked to losing key moving averages (MAs) over the past two weeks. The 50-day MA is currently positioned just above ETH’s trading price at $2,459, as illustrated by the blue line in the ETH/USDT daily chart below, which currently acts as a resistance for the token. Overall, ETH must maintain support above the $2,300 level. Additionally, the token needs to identify a bullish catalyst that could drive its price back above previously lost levels and target the next significant milestone at $3,000, a threshold that has not been reached since early August.

A CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost highlighted this metric’s importance in a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, mentioning what its trend means for investors. According to the analyst, the Non-Realized Profit metric offers a window into the unrealized gains or losses held by Bitcoin investors, which can influence future market movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Not Sold On Uptober As Sentiment Remains Neutral Understanding The Current Zone In Non-Realized Profits The Non-Realized Profit metric is often used to calculate the difference between the current price of Bitcoin and the price at which each coin was last moved, without accounting for coins that have been sold. High values in this metric suggest that investors hold significant unrealized profits, which could lead to increased selling pressure as they may choose to realize these gains. Conversely, negative values indicate that many investors hold positions at a loss, potentially signaling a market bottom and a favourable entry point for new investors. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the Non-Realized Profit metric is mostly in the negative zone. This situation implies that many Bitcoin holders are either at break-even points or experiencing unrealized losses. Historically, such conditions have been associated with market bottoms, where the asset is considered undervalued. This scenario could present a strategic “opportunity” for investors looking to enter the market or increase their holdings. According to Darkfost, what sets the current market apart is that the unrealized profits have reached unprecedented highs compared to previous cycles, even while in the negative zone. This anomaly suggests that the ongoing market cycle may differ from past Bitcoin patterns. The analyst cautions that while this could lead to unique investment opportunities, it also introduces potential risks due to the deviation from established trends. Bitcoin Continuous Struggle Below $70,000 After briefly touching the $64,000 price level yesterday, Bitcoin has faced correction once again, falling back below this price mark—currently, the asset trades for $62,340, down by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. This decline in performance from Bitcoin appears to have also dragged the global crypto market cap along with it, with the overall market cap valuation of crypto currently down by 3.3% in the past day to $2.26 trillion. The plunge has had a severe impact on traders, most especially the ones on long positions. According to data from Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, 59,005 traders were liquidated, with the total liquidations sitting at $176.57 million.

ARK also offloaded 135,665 shares of Robinhood (HOOD), worth nearly $3.5 million, to comply with a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule that forbids funds from having more than 5% exposure to securities in companies that themselves derive more than 15% of their income from the sale of securities. HOOD shares rose nearly 10% on Tuesday to close at $25.61.

42390221,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbtYPV,1728463727,"Record Stablecoin Liquidity, Spike in BTC Transactions Could Fuel Bitcoin Price Surge","Stablecoin market capitalization has steadily reached $169 billion led by USDT and USDC, with the increase preceding price movements in past cycles.  Historical data suggests a positive correlation between increased stablecoin balances on exchanges and rising Bitcoin prices, with a notable 146% increase in USDT on exchanges since January 2023.  There has been a significant increase in large or ""whale"" transactions on the Bitcoin network, alongside a spike in on-chain volume.  A record amount of dollar-backed stablecoins and a spike in large bitcoin {{BTC}} transactions could form the bedrock for a broader BTC rally in the coming weeks, keeping the asset’s bullish October seasonality intact.  Stablecoin liquidity has continued to grow to a record $169 billion in late September, data from CryptoQuant shows, indicating a 31% year-to-date (YTD) increase.  The dominant players remain Tether’s USDT, whose market cap increased by $28 billion to nearly $120 billion with 71% of the market share, and Circle’s USDC, which recorded a market cap rise of $11 billion to $36 billion, a 44% increase YTD, with a 21% market share.  Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to offer price stability by being pegged to a reference asset, which could be fiat money like the US dollar, commodities like gold, or other cryptocurrencies.  Each stablecoin is supposed to be backed by an equivalent amount of fiat currency held in reserve. Stablecoins are typically issued against fiat deposits, meaning an increase in stablecoin supply is an increase in actual fiat money placed into the crypto ecosystem.  Most crypto spot and futures trading are conducted against stablecoin pairs and an increase in the stablecoin liquidity signals a potential dry powder that can be deployed for crypto purchases.  Historic movements show a clear correlation between the number of stablecoins held on crypto exchanges, which has grown 20% this year, and higher bitcoin prices.  “Larger balances of stablecoins on exchanges are positively correlated with higher bitcoin and crypto prices,” CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno said. “Since January 2023, when the current bull cycle officially started, the total amount of USDT (ERC20) on exchanges has grown from $9.2 billion to $22.7 billion (+146%).”  “Notably, these balances have grown by 20%, even as Bitcoin’s price has remained flat,” Moreno said.  Bitcoin is down over 6% since the start of October, data shows, a month that has only twice ended in the red since 2013, chalking gains of as high as 60% and an average of 22% to make it the best for investor returns.  Price jumps of as high as 16% generally appear after October 15, with the available stablecoin liquidity likely supporting a rise. A key catalyst in the months ahead is the U.S. presidential election, which could set the tone for general monetary and crypto policies for the next four years.  Whale Transactions Grow  On-chain analytics firm Santiment reported a bump in whale transactions on the Bitcoin network, which has historically preceded a price surge. Whales are a colloquial term referring to large holders of any asset whose market moves can directly influence prices.  “Our metrics indicate a major spike in dormant activity on Bitcoin's network to pair with $37.4B in on-chain volume Tuesday, the most in 7 months,” Santiment said in an X post. “Historically, stagnant BTC moving back into regular circulation is a positive for future price movement.”",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/09/record-stablecoin-liquidity-spike-in-btc-transactions-could-fuel-bitcoin-price-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d791e01d5ccdf9a8da0224d446a50547883f666-1420x799.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Interestingly, the analyst suggested that the crypto could still reach a higher price target, calling the $44 price level “conservative.” XRP Price To Reach $44 Egrag Crypto predicted in an X post that the XRP price would reach $44. He highlighted this price level as one of the conservative targets based on the current cycle and the Fib Channel. The $44 price level is the target based on the Fib 0.702 channel. The other price targets he mentioned were $13 and $27, based on the Fib 0.5 and 0.618 channels, respectively. Related Reading: Here’s Where We Are In The Bitcoin Bull Cycle According To The Wall Street Cheat Sheet The analyst is confident that the XRP price will hit these price targets. He claimed that since the crypto’s inception, the chart has indicated that the market can expect pumps to these Fibonacci Channel levels. Egrag Crypto also suggested that XRP will reach these price targets in this bull run, claiming that this is what the chart states. Egrag’s label of these price targets as conservative also means that the XRP price could still rise higher in this bull run. The analyst didn’t provide any other price target, but other analysts like Javon Marks have predicted that the crypto could reach three digits. Marks recently predicted that XRP could rise to as high as $200. The analyst stated that the crypto has broken out of a Pennant pattern of over six years. He claimed that hold of this break plus a Logarithmic Follow-Through after can send XRP to $200, representing a price gain of over 30,000%. Marks expects the XRP price to reach $3.3 in the short term, close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.8. The analyst explained that since 2022, the crypto has confirmed multiple hidden bull divergences and is on course to achieve a bull breakout. According to him, this bull breakout will lead to a price gain of over 450% as XRP reaches the $3.3 range. He added that this price breakout may only be a start, especially since he believes the crypto will still reach $200. The Worst Case Scenario Amid these bullish predictions for the XRP price, Egrag Crypto has also revealed the worst scenario for the crypto in this market cycle. He claimed that XRP would at least reach between $2.3 and $5.89 in this bull run and outlined two reasons why he believes the crypto can at least reach these price targets no matter what. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Hit $100,000 Before The End Of The Year First, he noted that XRP managed to do a 10x from the bottom after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped the lawsuit in December 2020. He stated that XRP could easily hit the $5 to $ range if there is a similar situation after the SEC appeal. He added that the crypto might reach the Fib 1.618 level at around $6.5. Secondly, he mentioned that the XRP price could hit $2.31 and $2,88 if the Bitcoin price reaches $80,000 and $100,000, respectively. He expects XRP to mirror BTC’s move, just like it did in the 2021 bull run.

42390210,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbtXaD,1728452860,"Crypto Majors BTC, ETH, XRP Little Changed as HBO Calls Peter Todd the Bitcoin Creator","The crypto market shrugged off HBO's 'big reveal' and BTC remains unchanged after Peter Todd was named as Satoshi.  China's post-holiday rally has come to a screeching halt with indices well into the red during the morning trading session.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} remains little changed as a hyped HBO documentary turned out to be a market dud, and traders await the latest U.S. economic figures, scheduled for later Wednesday and Thursday, before further positioning.  BTC lost just 0.4% in the past 24 hours, with a 0.61% drop in major tokens tracked by the liquid CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index. Ether {{ETH}} rose 0.3%, BNB Chain’s {{BNB}}, Solana’s {{SOL}} and XRP {{XRP}} were little changed. Sui Network’s {{SUI}} fell 7% after a multi-week run that saw the token gain over 20% since late September.  The HBO documentary ""Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery"" sparked significant interest and speculation in the cryptocurrency community about the identity of Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, in the past week. Nakamoto’s true identity, in theory, could be a sudden volatility-boosting event for crypto markets, and past attempts have been unfruitful.  HBO continued that streak by pinning Bitcoin developer Peter Todd as Nakamoto on pieces of online evidence from the network’s early years. Todd denied the claims in an interview with CoinDesk, and the Bitcoin community on X has largely dismissed HBO’s apparent findings.  Betting market activity  Over $44.3 million was bet on Polymarket as to who would be identified as Satoshi. Most of the volume was split between Len Sassaman and Adam Back, who both caught the eyes of bettors in the market’s early days.  Another market that asked bettors if Satoshi’s identity would be proven this year was fairly unchanged despite the documentary hype. The ‘Yes’ side of “Not Proven in 2024” dipped to 82% from 98% when the documentary was announced, but quickly moved back into the 90s within three days. It is currently at 95.5%.  ETFs bleed money, China rally wanes  On Tuesday, spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. recorded a cumulative outflow of over $18 million, SoSoValue data show, with Fidelity’s FBTC losing over $48 million. ETH ETFs recorded over $8 million in withdrawals, led by a $4.8 million outflow from Bitwise’s ETHW product.  Low volatility in BTC came after a lack of new measures and announcements of new stimulus at a Chinese briefing on Tuesday pared hopes of a long-drawn stimulus package – one that contributed to a bitcoin run in the past few weeks.  Stocks in China are deep in the red as the stimulus euphoria has seemed to have worn off, with the Shanghai Composite Index down 3.9% and Shenzhen’s Component Index down 4%.  Traders, meanwhile, look toward an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting for clues on where BTC might move next. The agency is expected to release FOMC minutes and key economic figures from August that track growth on Wednesday and Thursday – which typically moves prices.  Polymarket bettors are forecasting a 25bps decrease for November, while the chance of a 50bps decrease is down to 9%, having fallen from 46% at the end of September.  “As the Chinese rally wanes, we anticipate capital reallocation back into crypto, reflecting the industry’s growing maturity as an alternative risk-on asset,” QCP Capital traders said in a Wednesday broadcast. “We foresee near-term downside risk for equities due to upcoming earnings season and CPI release, which may challenge their lofty valuations. Geopolitical tensions further complicate the outlook.”  “However, we maintain a medium-term optimistic stance, expecting election headlines to continue driving crypto movement,” QCP added.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.3460 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $0.3520 resistance zone. Cardano Price Consolidates Losses After testing the $0.3680 resistance, Cardano struggled to continue higher. ADA formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.3550 and $0.3500 support levels. The price even declined below $0.3450 before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $0.3409 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.3450 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3681 swing high to the $0.3409 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.3520 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.3460 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.3460 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $0.3520 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3681 swing high to the $0.3409 low. The next key resistance might be $0.3550. If there is a close above the $0.3550 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.3680 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.400. More Downsides in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.3550 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.3420 level. The next major support is near the $0.3400 level. A downside break below the $0.3400 level could open the doors for a test of $0.3250. The next major support is near the $0.3120 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.

34477244,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646864,1728450014,Bitcoin Supply In Loss Nears 20%: Could This Trigger A Fresh Surge?,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin supply in loss has shot up close to the 20% mark after the recent bearish action in the coin’s price. Bitcoin UTXO Supply In Loss Has Seen A Sharp Increase Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr talked about the recent trend in the Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Supply in Loss indicator. The “UTXO Supply in Loss” measures, as its name suggests, the total percentage of UTXOs in existence (or more simply, just the tokens) that are being held at some net unrealized loss. The indicator works by going through the on-chain history of each UTXO in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. Generally, the last transfer of any token represents the last point that it changed hands, so the price at its time can be assumed to be its cost basis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Not Sold On Uptober As Sentiment Remains Neutral When this cost basis for any UTXO is greater than the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, then that particular UTXO can be assumed to be underwater right now. The UTXO Supply in Loss adds up all UTXOs satisfying this condition to find what percentage of the total supply that they make up for. Like this metric, there also exists the UTXO Supply in Profit, which naturally keeps track of the UTXOs of the opposite type. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin UTXO Supply in Loss over the history of the asset: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin UTXO Supply in Loss registered a sharp plunge to the zero mark (note that the chart is reversed as it uses a negative scale) when the cryptocurrency’s price set its all-time high (ATH) back in March of this year. Whenever BTC sets a new record, 100% of the investors get into profits, so the UTXO Supply in Loss shrinking down to zero is only natural. As the coin has witnessed bearish momentum in the last few months, though, the metric’s value has gone through an increase again. The 90-day moving average (MA) of the indicator, which is also listed in the chart, has now come close to the 20% mark. The CryptoQuant author has marked in the graph the previous instances of the metric making a similar retest of this level. “In previous cycles, similar conditions were sometimes followed by a price rally,” notes Axel. Thus, it’s possible that a price surge may follow for Bitcoin this time as well. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Be Preparing For Next Big Rally, Analyst Explains As for why the UTXO Supply in Loss going up can be bullish for Bitcoin, the reason is that the investors in profit are the ones more likely to participate in selling, so whenever their number reduces, the chances of a selloff also go down. BTC Price Bitcoin had shown some recovery beyond the $64,000 level yesterday, but it would appear that the asset couldn’t maintain as it’s back at $62,500 now.

The spike in Treasury market volatility, represented by the MOVE index, can lead to risk aversion.  The slide in Chinese stocks may reverse the money flow to Asian stocks and cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} traded listless between key averages early Tuesday amid elevated volatility in the U.S. bond market and sharp losses in Chinese stocks.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value held above $62,000, with the Bollinger bandwidth, an unbound technical oscillator, falling to levels seen ahed of the mid-June downside price turbulence.  Bollinger bands are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day simple moving average of the asset's price. The bandwidth is calculated by dividing the spread between the volatility bands by the 20-period SMA. Rising bandwidth values indicate high volatility and falling values suggest otherwise. A volatility explosion often follows a prolonged period of low readings.  The bitcoin market, however, showed no such signs at press time, with prices locked within a narrow range between the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) resistance at $63,550 and the 50-day SMA support at $60,819.  The MOVE index, which measures expected volatility in U.S. Treasury notes, surged 24% Monday, reaching the highest since early January, according to TradingView.  Increased volatility in the Treasury notes, which play a prominent role in global collateral and finance, often causes financial tightening and risk aversion. The situation benefits the U.S. dollar, potentially weighing over risk assets, like stocks and bitcoin.  The path of least resistance for the dollar index is on the higher side as the notion of an aggressively dovish Fed has faded. According to ING, the dollar index could rise to 103 by the end of the month. The index was steady at around 102.45 at press time.  Chinese stocks slide  China's Shanghai Composite Index fell by 4.6%, ending a ten-day winning streak, likely due to disappointment over the government's lack of fiscal stimulus.  Beijing announced a slew of stimulus measures in late September, torching a sharp rally that supposedly sucked out capital from other Asian equity markets and bitcoin.

The first major resistance is near the $0.5460 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5453 swing high to the $0.5211 low. The next key resistance could be $0.5550. A clear move above the $0.5550 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6000 resistance or even $0.6050 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5360 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5200 level.

42390232,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbtYzP,1728446400,The DPRK's Deep Roots in Crypto,"Last week, CoinDesk's Sam Kessler reported that developers and IT workers employed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea – i.e. North Korea – had managed to get themselves hired by a number of crypto projects, giving them two different ways of raising funds for the national regime.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  DPRK IT workers  The narrative  CoinDesk reporter Sam Kessler found that more than a dozen different crypto companies and projects – including some well-known ones – inadvertently hired developers and IT workers from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (aka North Korea), something that's troubling on a number of levels for these projects.  Why it matters  North Korea is under heavy sanctions, meaning hiring developers from the country would put a project in violation of U.S. law. It also seems clear that some of these employees enabled the projects they worked for to be hacked.  Breaking it down  North Korean employees working for U.S. companies isn't a new problem. In July, cybersecurity firm KnowBe4 published a blog post explaining how it accidentally hired a DPRK software engineer. A few months before that, an Arizona resident and four others were charged by prosecutors with helping DPRK IT workers land roles at U.S. companies.  These employees send (or are forced to send) most of their paychecks to the regime, which in turn helps the DPRK continue its various activities. Projects that are compromised by vulnerabilities inserted by these employees also risk losing more funds to North Korea. It's not just a hypothetical concern; prosecutors have brought various charges alleging DPRK-affiliated IT workers were able to compromise companies.  Sanctions concerns first: Any company that hires an employee based in North Korea violates U.S. sanctions law. It doesn't necessarily matter if this hiring was inadvertent – the companies can be prosecuted regardless.  Kessler reported that, so far at least, the U.S. government has ""been lenient about bringing charges – on some level acknowledging that they were victims of, at best, an unusually elaborate and sophisticated type of identity fraud.""  It's still something companies will have to pay closer attention to as they move forward, especially with crypto gaining increasing attention in recent months.  Companies also need to be concerned with getting hacked by the DPRK, which again is not just a hypothetical concern. Axie Infinity is perhaps one of the most prominent examples of how easily hackers can steal funds from a crypto company after just a small mistake. Axie was hacked in March 2022, losing $625 million at the time. U.S. officials tied North Korean hacking group Lazarus to the theft a month later.  Several other projects were hacked after employing DPRK IT workers, Kessler reported, including Sushi Finance.  Sam's entire report is worth your attention – I'm re-linking it here – and it would behoove companies to consider how to mitigate these kinds of risks moving forward.

34474680,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646944,1728444646,"Cardano Surges In Strength—Now 10x More Powerful, Analyst Says","With new developments and predictions, Cardano (ADA) continues to attract attention in the crypto world, presenting investors with a divided picture. Analyst Dan Gambardello recently expressed a bullish prognosis, asserting that Cardano is now 10 times more robust than it was in previous cycles. The long-term prospects appear promising, however, the short-term market sentiment indicates that a cautious approach is preferable. Related Reading: Analyst Foresees 90% Cardano Price Drop in Next 6 Months Gambardello said that the move to a fully decentralized, community-owned blockchain is one of the most important changes that makes him more optimistic. This important change happened after the Chang Upgrade went live on September 1. Gambardello said that the update has strengthened Cardano’s base, making it a more stable and independent network. However, this is only one part of the story. Cardano: 10x Stronger Than Last Cycle At This Moment. 🌐 Owned By Community ❌ IOG Burned Keys ⚡ Hydra Scaling 📈 Higher Market Cap Position 🤝 Massive Partnerships 🛡️ Unmatched L1 Security 💰 DeFi Ecosystem 🐻 Survived The Bear As Top 10 — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) October 6, 2024 Cardano’s Most Recent Advancements One of the major steps that Cardano took to signify its full shift into community administration was the termination of its genesis keys. Leading this milestone adds another level of security and decentralization to the blockchain, thanks to the efforts of Input Output Global (IOG). According to Gambardello, these elements make Cardano’s network far more robust than it was in earlier cycles. Furthermore, Cardano’s Hydra, a layer-2 scaling solution, extends the network’s appeal. Hydra’s objective is to enhance transaction throughput while simultaneously preserving high levels of security and decentralization. This solution could provide Cardano with a competitive advantage, particularly in its pursuit of dominating the competition with other top networks such as Ethereum, as scalability is a significant obstacle for many blockchains. ADA Market Position Cardano has also experienced a substantial increase in its market position. ADA rated 12th in the crypto market and had a market cap of $2.997 billion in 2020. At the time of writing, Cardano maintains a market capitalization of $12.64 billion. Despite recent underperformance, Cardano’s resilience during the 2022 and 2023 market decline has kept it in the top 10 for an extended period. Related Reading: BlackRock Declares Bitcoin The New ‘Gold Alternative’ – Here’s Why Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast Meanwhile, with technical indicators suggesting a cautious outlook for investors, Cardano (ADA) is presently in a bearish territory in the market. By November 7, 2024, the price of Cardano is expected to climb by 16.86%, according to CoinCodex, to over $0.412024. At 49, the Fear & Greed Index says traders are neutral even at this potential upward trajectory. The price volatility of Cardano had been at 5.70% with 60% positivity, boasting 18 out of 30 days in the green in the last 30 days. Based on these factors, many analysts believe that today isn’t probably the best time to make investments in Cardano.

The price is trading just above $2,430 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $2,420 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must stay above the $2,400 support level to start another increase in the near term. Ethereum Price Holds Support Ethereum price failed to extend gains above the $2,500 resistance zone. ETH started a downside correction like Bitcoin and traded below the $2,465 support zone. There was also a move below the $2,420 level. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,310 swing low to the $2,519 high. It seems like the bulls are now protecting more downsides below the $2,400 support level. Ethereum price is now trading just above $2,430 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

Notably, a crypto analyst has forecasted that Cardano, which is currently trading below the $1 mark, is on the brink of a major breakout, with the potential to skyrocket to $5. Expert Sees Cardano Hitting $5 Soon Popular crypto analyst, Dan Gambardello took to X (formerly Twitter) on October 6 to share his bullish projections for Cardano, highlighting past bull cycles and market trends. Gambardello told his 262,900 followers that Cardano could quickly rise above $1 between now and December. Related Reading: Optimism, Aptos, And Taiko Face $169.66 Million In Token Unlocks, Should You Buy Or Sell? In a detailed video outlining the rationale behind his bullish prediction, Gambardello noted that if Cardano can follow the market trends established during the previous bull cycle, its price could easily skyrocket to $1. During the last bull market in 2021, Cardano had been among the top altcoins, experiencing significant gains that propelled its price to new all-time highs. Although it surged to an all-time high of $3.10 in September 2021, Cardano has since plummeted by 88.43% and is currently trading at $0.35. CoinMarketCap’s data also reveals that ADA’s price has fallen by 8.41% over the past week, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s bearish momentum. Despite the sluggish price growth, Gambardello has forecasted that ADA could potentially exceed all time highs to reach $5. The analyst emphasized that Cardano is even more well positioned for a bull rally than last cycle, highlighting positive signs in key metrics such as the altcoin’s Relative Index Strength (RSI) and higher low action. To be more precise, Gamberdello projects that Cardank could reach $1 before the end of 2024, and then soar to new price levels between $5 and $10. The analyst has expressed confidence in this bullish outlook, emphasizing that a $5 price increase was a realistic target. For Cardano to reach new all-time highs of $5, Gambardello has disclosed that the 50-week and 20-week Moving Average (MA) are crucial levels to watch. He stressed that ADA must first break above $0.38, and then move to $0.42 before it can experience a potential breakout to the upside. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Hit $100,000 Before The End Of The Year Bullish Forecast For Cardano Continues To Grow Sharing a similar sentiment with Gambardello, a popular crypto analyst, identified as ‘Sssebi’ on X has predicted that ADA could potentially skyrocket to $10 by 2025. The analyst notes that the cryptocurrency could experience a sharp breakout to the upside, first surging to $0.5 before hitting the coveted $1 price mark. After this, Sssebi predicts that ADA will rise to $3, surprising the broader cryptocurrency market with its massive growth. He believes that following a potential price surge to $10, investors will begin “FOMOing” hard as they recognize the immense potential of Cardano.

While INJ, the native currency of the protocol, is under pressure, cooling off after rallying to as high as $52 early this year, the recent development is a huge confidence boost. Looking at trends may signal that more users are flowing to Injective, a net positive for INJ in the coming sessions. Injective Generates More Revenue Than The BNB Chain, Avalanche According to CryptoRank data, Injective Protocol generated $4 million in revenue derived from gas fees. Every transfer or smart contract deployment attracts a gas fee like every other public ledger like Bitcoin or Solana. This fee is distributed to the winning validator or miner as an incentive to operate a node. With $4 million in revenue, Injective created more than the BNB Chain, one of the largest blockchains by market cap, and Avalanche, a network in the top 20, according to CoinMarketCap. These platforms generated $3.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: This Week’s Trends And Historical Patterns For Q4 At this level, Injective also surpassed what some of the top Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Blast generated over this period. For comparison, Arbitrum, despite being the largest and managing over $13.2 billion, according to L2Beat. Ethereum, Tron, Solana, and Base churned more revenue than Injective. Ethereum funneled $159 million to its validators from July through September, while Tron and Solana cumulatively moved over $200 million. The expansion of revenue, mostly from Tron, a scalable platform, is due to the meme coin activity on its network following the launch of SunPump in August. At the same time, Solana also benefited from meme coins and an uptick in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume over this period. Will INJ Rise To $50? It remains to be seen whether the recovery of DeFi activities while boosting Injective and its total value locked (TVL). As of October 8, the protocol manages over $40 million, looking at DeFiLlama data. At the same time, the platform has processed over 1 billion onchain transactions.

Presently, INJ is inside a descending channel, finding support at $15. While buyers of Q1 2024 are still in the picture, the token is down 60% from March highs.
