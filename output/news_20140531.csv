42397666,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDjGe,1401543116,"DISH, Overstock, and Bootstrapping a New Currency","On the heels of the recent Dish Network announcement to begin accepting bitcoin payments, we saw the same clueless chorus of naysayers and payment newbies come out claiming that Dish doesn't really accept bitcoin because they actually end up with US dollars.  It would be just as ridiculous to say that a hotel in Barbados doesn't accept US dollars because, after the VISA credit card transaction, the hotel ends up with Barbados dollars.  Dish Network selected bitcoin payment processor Coinbase to manage the foreign exchange conversion risk in the same way that other international merchants select credit card processors. It matters not what the merchant's native currency is, but what they permit consumers to use when purchasing.  As with Overstock's decision to begin accepting bitcoin payments, the Dish announcement is significant because it adds yet another payment outlet for holders of bitcoin and it brings another large merchant into the ecosystem of processing bitcoin transactions.  Dish's executive vice president and chief operating officer Bernie Han said that Dish sees its new payment option as a way to boost customer service:  “We always want to deliver choice and convenience for our customers and that includes the method they use to pay their bills.”  One cannot overlook the fact that something as mundane as a payment option is also being strategically deployed as a competitive wedge in a branding and messaging campaign. However, this residual bonus has a diminishing impact as more companies announce their intention to embrace bitcoin and we move past its early adopter phase.  The monetary transition process  While some analysts observe that new merchant acceptance has the effect of creating downward price pressure for bitcoin, since processors immediately convert into national currency for their clients, I maintain that the entire process is simply part of bootstrapping a new currency.  And yes, selling pressure from new merchants converting out of bitcoin may not always be replaced by new buying. Bitcoin is barely in the early stages of this monetary transition process.  That process includes price discovery on liquid exchanges, creation of closed-loop systems to both receive and spend bitcoin, and finally, pricing of goods and services in the new numéraire.  The trend towards global participation  In an important but somewhat pessimistic paper, ""Cryptocurrencies, Network Effects, and Switching Costs,"" William Luther observes that there is a systemic bias against monetary transition. His research concludes that despite the inferiority of the prevailing currency and due to both network effects and switching costs, ""cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are unlikely to generate widespread acceptance in the absence of either significant monetary instability or government support"".  As an economist, I disagree with this thesis because it fails to consider global usage and the potential for bypassing capital controls. Luther's cited monetary instability or government support are both conditions relevant only within the restricted political borders of a monetary regime. They may serve as great litmus tests in a confined jurisdiction, but they are utterly useless in considering cross-border transactions.  The trend towards global merchants participating in a global economy will only serve to strengthen this dynamic. We are witnessing it today with at least 60 countries blocked out of the current prevailing payment systems, and hence unaware of the switching costs and network effects of Luther's incumbent monies.  Quoting bitcoin prices  Beyond the network effect of incumbents, I do agree that the holy grail for bitcoin is having prices quoted and displayed in bitcoin rather than mentally going through a conversion process. This step completes the process for monetary transition and it is difficult to predict how that specific step occurs.  In ""The Origin, Classification and Utility of Bitcoin,"" Peter Šurda correctly states:  “Even though not money, bitcoin is a medium of exchange ... While it is true that economic calculation is beneficial, this is merely one of the relevant aspects of media of exchange. Economic calculation depends on the unit of account, and while bitcoin is not used as a unit of account to any apparent degree, it may happen in the future, and its utility would increase even more in such a case.”  Redditor ISkiAtAlta makes an interesting observation on why it's not easier or more beneficial to (re)obtain bitcoin than it is to obtain or use fiat, claiming that we're not there yet because the barrier to obtaining bitcoin is too high and the perceived benefits have not yet been internalized – particularly for new users.  That above rationale addresses the issue of monetary switching costs, but I think it applies equally to the establishment of a numéraire, or favored unit of account.  Framing it as an issue of timing, ISkiAtAlta offers three items that must be present for motivating consumers to go through the trouble of transacting in bitcoin: (1) it has to become easier to obtain bitcoin, (2) people must see the value of holding their savings in bitcoin, and (3) merchants must offer discounts for bitcoin transactions.  I would add that consumers must have more user-friendly applications and that merchants must also see the value of holding balances in bitcoin which becomes reinforced by expenses and liabilities – expressed in bitcoin through supply chain vendor demand or employee demand. It becomes infinitely easier to maintain bitcoin balances if a merchant or company knows that risk can be reasonably hedged and that others will also accept settlement in bitcoin.  Bootstrapping a new currency is always a chicken-and-egg dilemma, but when it comes to volatility, original perspective can be helpful too. Perhaps it's not bitcoin that is volatile against the US dollar, but it's the US dollar that is volatile against the future store-of-value bitcoin.

Suggested fillings include caribbean jerk chicken, soft shell crab, toasted almonds and smashed avocado. Hero Subs will announce the winner and launch its new sandwich on Wednesday 18th June.  Melbourne on a roll  Melbourne has been leading the way for bitcoin startups and merchant acceptance in Australia. As well as being home to both CoinJar and DC POS, the country's second city also has a whopping 44 bitcoin and litecoin-accepting businesses listed on Coinmap.org – the highest in the country and neighboring region.  CoinJar is also known for its bitcoin advocacy around its native country. The company publishes a blog called 'CoinJar Stories', with profiles of bitcoin-accepting businesses from Australia and abroad, and the paths they took on their way to enlightenment.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/31/hero-subs-sandwich-shop-becomes-melbournes-first-to-accept-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bae3fc1ea12af5f1b3e862ac80d0200bc7cede29-1000x708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397673,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDjMY,1401534353,Mark T. Williams to Bitcoin Bulls: Time Will Vindicate My Prediction,"Last December, Boston University School of Management professor Mark T. Williams issued a prediction that drew rapt attention from the mainstream media, as well as the united ire of the bitcoin industry, when he boldly projected that the price of bitcoin would lose 99% of its value and fall below $10 by the end of June 2014.  However, at press time, the price of bitcoin on CoinDesk's USD Bitcoin Price Index remains well above this figure, rising 34% in May to pass the US$600 mark. But, if Williams was hoping the community would forget his prediction, he was proven false this week when a number of leaders in the bitcoin space began to call for Williams to comment on what they feel is the inaccuracy of his prior remarks.  For example, Bitcoin Magazine published an extensive piece dedicated to analyzing Williams' past statements on bitcoin, while VC investor Erik Voorhees took to Twitter to question whether Williams would face his critics now that his projections haven't come to fruition.    Mark T. Williams, professor of finance at Boston, was wrong about Bitcoin. I wonder if he'll acknowledge his error? http://t.co/JONvVmMFye      — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) May 30, 2014    Williams remains defiant  In a new interview with CoinDesk, Williams opened up about his famous prediction, offering a defiant analysis of why he is still convinced the current high price of bitcoin won't remain for long.  Williams told CoinDesk:  ""I continue to stick to my 2013 prediction that bitcoin is grossly overpriced and the price will eventually adjust dramatically downward as the priced-for-perfection expectations set by bitcoin promoters cannot be met.""  Williams suggested that while ""asset bubbles cannot be easily timed"", the dramatic swings in price displayed by bitcoin provide evidence that consumers should be weary of making digital currency investments.  He added: ""Will this bubble be completely deflated in the next six months to a year? Time will tell. In January 2013 it was worth only $13. If the question is, 'Do I still see bitcoin dropping to these much lower levels in the future?' The answer is yes.""  History will decide  Responding to the veracity of his prediction, Williams stated that he believes his projection, that bitcoin would decline in value by as much as 99%, has perhaps been more accurate than those in the digital currency community concede.  For example, he cited the February flash crash that drove prices down at major bitcoin exchange BTC-e to as low as $102, a drop, he says, of more than 90% from bitcoin's market peak of roughly $1,200.  Williams reiterated that, long-term, his prediction will be more correct than those issued by the industry's thought leaders, in part because of the demonstrated instability in the market:  ""In contrast to the Winkelvoss twins that prognosticated that Bitcoin would rise to a mind boggling price of $40,000, I am confident that the true value of Bitcoin is closer to my estimate than theirs.""  Ecosystem improvements aren't enough  When asked whether the bitcoin community has done enough to address and improve the safety of the ecosystem in the wake of Mt. Gox, Williams was equally critical.  In particular, Williams took aim at the industry's major trade organisation, the Bitcoin Foundation, stating that this group has been especially slow to address the technology's central issues or to raise awareness of these potential faults to the general public, stating:  ""The bitcoin ecosystem still remains shaky as measured by the drama that continues to unfold at the Bitcoin Foundation. This organization continues to lack strong corporate governance and does not send out a positive message to the market.""  Williams also laid the blame on regulators, who he criticized as not going far enough to protect consumers, despite the wide range of warnings issued by central banks and government bodies internationally:  ""For bitcoin to be successful regulation needs to be coordinated on an international basis. [...] Recent stern warnings to consumers by the SEC and FINRA about the high risks of bitcoin do not address the critical issue of which agency or group of agencies should regulate and have oversight and enforcement control.""  Bitcoin bubble remains  Williams indicated that despite bitcoin's recent price resilience, he still feels that it remains ""grossly over-inflated"" due to what he views as its ""concentrated ownership, artificially limited supply and overhyped demand"".  The capital markets professor suggested that rather than looking at bitcoin's comparative recent price stability, the ecosystem should remember the losses that consumers incurred in the wake of the insolvency and bankruptcy of Mt. Gox, stating:  ""The important story which seems to be missed is that there are many investors that bought at the top of the market at $1,200 only six or so months ago and are now sitting on sizable market losses.""  Williams also suggested that he is not alone in this prediction, saying that more academics are likely to begin taking his viewpoint publicly. Specifically, he mentioned Yale University professor Robert Shiller, who has previously come forward to denounce bitcoin as an asset bubble.  Williams concluded: ""I am not alone in the view that bitcoin is in a hyper bubble that will eventually pop.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/31/mark-t-williams-to-bitcoin-bulls-time-will-vindicate-my-prediction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f6e0ba2b98f1d5327d4492114e87073488fffee-1009x703.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397667,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDjHd,1401530127,Why Professional Audits are Essential in a Post-Gox World,"“Can we pretend February never happened?” asked Gavin Andresen at Bitcoin2014, in an oblique reference to the collapse of Mt Gox.  It’s easy to sympathise with the sentiment. Mt Gox’s demise shone a spotlight on the bitcoin community’s ability to weed out bad actors and found it lacking.  While the legal disputes around Mt Gox continue to trundle on in the background, one issue has risen to prominence as a result of the affair: transparency.  However, with each third-party 'audit’ of bitcoin exchanges and other businesses, the question of who should be performing these checks, and what they should involve, is of increasing importance.  Trust is not enough  Major bitcoin exchanges and wallet providers moved quickly to reassure customers following Mt Gox’s collapse, issuing a joint statement that called for “appropriate security safeguards that are independently audited and tested on a regular basis”.  To date, those independent tests have largely been carried out by trusted individuals within the bitcoin community, who have avoided calling their admittedly narrow checks 'audits'.  Andreas Antonopoulos vouched for Coinbase back in February, Stefan Thomas examined Kraken in March and most recently, Mike Hearn tested Bitstamp, assuring its customers “that at this time Bitstamp holds suﬃcient bitcoins to cover their customer deposits.”  The system so far has been largely ad-hoc, with exchanges promising to submit to regular checks and selecting different developers each time (which is preferential to the same individual auditing an exchange repeatedly).  In the long-term, though, said George Quigley, a partner at accountancy firm BDO, the community needs an institution-based approach that looks at much more than just how much bitcoin is held:  “Am I going to rely on a person who goes in and says, 'it's okay, all the bitcoin are there,' or are you going to rely on a provider who says, 'here's a management statement, here's how they control the environment'?”  Bitcoin auditors needed  Of course, one would expect an auditing company to make that argument, but it’s an issue that the community has recognized too. Kraken CEO Jesse Powell has previously told CoinDesk of the need for a bitcoin auditing firm, saying:  “The firm would need to independently have a strong grasp of bitcoin, crypto, the ability to review code or write their own, be aware of opportunities for either party to compromise the audit and have the ability to prevent those compromises.”  However, he also added some scepticism about whether established firms could fulfil this role: “Traditionally, this skill set is not what accounting firms are known for.”  One company that has used established firms is Netagio, which boasts that “all funds are audited to an ISAE standard” (ISAE standing for 'International Standards for Assurance Engagements').  The company is one of a handful that deal in bitcoin and gold. And though its website is full of information about the company, including an address and phone number, like all players in the bitcoin space, said Netagio’s Managing Director Simon Hamblin, Mt Gox has cast a shadow over their business:  “That trust and transparency issue has damaged the [whole] bitcoin world.”  Despite engaging BDO, a known name in the auditing industry, to provide assurance that the company is properly run, though, Hamblin said Netagio still faces the same problems as other bitcoin businesses:  ""You struggle to get a banking relationship, you struggle to do the most basic things. That applies to insurance, for example. Particularly since the collapse of Mt Gox. The insurance market has closed up. It’s moving forward, but it’s a very slow process.""  A gap in the market  Building trust in the bitcoin economy will help to move things forward faster, and proper checks and audits will undoubtedly be a large part of that.  Mike Hearn thinks it’s too early to build a standardised approach to auditing bitcoin businesses, telling CoinDesk earlier this week:  “There’s still a lot of variance in techniques and technologies being used, with new R&D still being done. Once things settle down some more, a standard way to audit exchanges would be useful indeed.”  What’s clear is that the demand for transparency has left a gap in the market, not only for established accountancy firms like BDO, but also for new bitcoin-specific accountancy firms. What they’ll look like is still up in the air.
