Ping Xie was the first bureau chief of the People's Bank of China's Financial Stability Bureau. During his time at the PBoC, Xie worked in the central bank's Non-Banking Supervision Department and Research Bureau, while also serving as the governor of its branch in Hunan Province, according to Bloomberg. He began his stint at the PBoC in 1985, departing in 2005.  Xie's lecture on cryptocurrencies is part of a series of nine lectures he plans to give on the topic of digital finance. The first lecture will be posted online on 23rd June, according to promotional materials.  It's a notable development for a long-time fixture in China's regulatory space who played a role in the economic reforms undertaken by China's government.  Beyond his work at the central bank, Xie served as general manager of Central Huijin Investment Company, a state-owned company that manages state-owned assets and investments on behalf of China, where he focused on overseas investments.  Xie is also the author of the book focused on digital finance entitled ""Internet Finance in China: Introduction and Practical Approaches"".

Last November, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) revealed that it was including nine such startups in its program, which aims to offer a test environment for new financial products. In the second iteration of the sandbox initiative, the FCA is adding a total of 24 startups, nine of which are blockchain-related.  Christopher Woolard, the FCA's executive director of strategy and competition, said in a statement:  The nine blockchain companies are BlockEx, Disberse, Nivaura, Nuggets, OKLink, Oraclize, Paylinko, Sabstone and ZipZap. Out of that group, Nivaura took part in the previous round.  ""The sandbox continues to grow in popularity and it is particularly encouraging that both the number of firms applying and accepted for testing has increased in cohort two. That means more innovative firms, trialling more innovative propositions to bring to the market. This is an important part of the FCA’s commitment to promoting innovation and competition in the markets we regulate.""  Many of the startups are using the the tech to automate data transmission, financial asset transaction, and cross-border payments, among other applications. The FCA said it received a total of 77 submissions.  The application window for the third stage of the initiative is open until 31st July, with those accepted expected to begin in November.

42400018,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzRdm,1497541214,Singapore Exchange to Trial Blockchain Verification for Diamond Trading,"A diamond exchange service based in Singapore is partnering with two blockchain startups.  Singapore Diamond Investment Exchange (SDiX) is working with Kynetix, which develops blockchain-powered commodity marketplaces; and Everledger, which uses the tech to track the trade of diamonds. The three firms are working on an authentication proof-of-concept aimed at creating verifiable trails for precious stones.  According to a press release, the concept is designed to enable holders of diamonds with certificates from a verification laboratory to authenticate the ownership and authenticity of the diamonds using a distributed ledger. Changes of diamond ownership on SDiX will be updated on the ledger, creating a digital record for market participants.  Linus Koh, CEO of the Singapore Diamond Investment Exchange, said:  ""This new concept draws on blockchain’s distributed ledger capability to demonstrate how we can further instill confidence and convenience for the benefit of diamond investors and financiers.""  Companies and exchanges have been experimenting blockchain in industries where authenticity of physical commodity and identity can be a problem.

42400031,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzRnc,1497537027,Sea of Red: Top 10 Cryptocurrencies See Steep Declines as Market Turns,"Just hours after traders reported a shift in strategy, the global cryptocurrency markets appear to be correcting – and fast.  At press time, the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were all in steep periods of decline, with eight seeing declines of more than 10%. Even bitcoin, heralded as the 'safe haven' among available alternatives wasn't immune, dropping 15% at press time as its price retreated to its lowest total since 31st May.  Overall, the market shed roughly $6bn in a span of hours, declining from a combined total of $106bn to a press time total of $99.3bn, according to data from Coinmarketcap.  Taking an even broader look, more than 80 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies had seen more than double-digit declines, with some seeing declines of more than 30%.  Among those most impacted was IOTA, which began listing on exchanges this week and debuted at a $1bn market cap, only to fall more than 40% today. Lesser-known assets including I/O Coin, E-Currency Coin and Vericoin saw over 30% declines.  It wasn't just tokens on so-called infrastructure blockchains, running on their own unique networks, that were affected either.  Digital tokens sold as part of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and running on top of the ethereum blockchain saw big declines, with the tokens powering decentralized prediction market Gnosis and web browser Brave dropping by over 20% at press time.  Both debuted to market enthusiasm, raising $12.5m and $35m in token sales in recent months.  All in all, the development comes hours after traders reported preparing for a correction as the market's recent upward momentum slowed, and weeks after many had begun sounding the alarm that the market had become wildly divorced from fundamentals.  As such, speculation is high that this correction might only be the beginning of more declines.

Customers based in the US, much of Europe and the UK won't have to pay fees or mark-ups on foreign currency exchanges as part of the roll-out of the startup's service upgrade. The firm also said it is now offering ""instant"" transactions for users that send funds between those countries.  ""Consumers will not have to pay fees or foreign exchange mark-ups on payments sent to or from the US, UK and more than a dozen European countries,"" Circle explained in a statement. ""Payments can now be sent between US dollars, British pound sterling or Euros instantly and there are no fees at all and zero FX markup on exchange rates if sent using Circle.""

42400023,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzRhi,1497531619,"Game of Bluffs? With UAHF, Bitcoin Scaling Becomes Digital 'Missile Crisis'","Long a sort of Cold War, bitcoin's scaling debate is escalating into what may be best described as a digital Cuban Missile Crisis.  No longer open for diplomacy, users of the $40bn economic network, which hit an all-time high in value last weekend, are now in the midst of evaluating an ever-increasing array of threats from various network stakeholders, each of whom is seeking to steer discourse and development.  In yet another turn to the scaling debate, major mining firm Bitmain revealed yesterday a strategy outlining how it will respond should a controversial bitcoin code upgrade known as BIP 148 – a change the firm opposes – activate later this summer.  In a blog post, the company outlined its ""contingency plan"" if users attempt to force a protocol change, thereby circumventing the network's current structure in which those running its mining machines signal for upgrades.  Most notably, the proposal would dedicate mining resources to hard forking the network to a rule set with a larger block size – an upgrade that would likely result in two bitcoin networks and two tradeable bitcoin assets.  In response, the firm, long the center of bitcoin's long-running debate and often the foil to the open-source network's developers, invited the wider bitcoin community to join the effort.  Lay of the land  Admittedly, there been many proposals that could have lead to a network split over the last few years of bitcoin's scaling debate, but none have panned out so far.  In recent weeks, action has increased, though, with groups starting to form around two scaling proposals, SegWit2x and BIP 148. Each hopes to usher in a code change known as Segregated Witness (SegWit) in a different way. But, each also has a risk of splitting bitcoin into two assets and impacting the value of the network and its users. (Although, as of this morning, it looks like the two proposals might be made compatible.)  As such, the proposals have been highly politicized, creating market uncertainty and confusion that has arguably exacerbated a diversification by investors into other digital assets.  For instance, some have gone as far as to call BIP 148's activation date bitcoin’s ""Independence Day"" since it pushes through a change without requesting miners to signal support for it first. Philosophically, the movement takes the argument that bitcoin's mining was never meant to be so centralized, and that those that contribute resources to securing its ledger weren't meant to have outsized control.  But, Bitmain, among others, disagrees that BIP 148's user-activated soft fork (UASF) is the best way to push through upgrades to the cryptocurrency. As have others, the group is citing public safety in its comments.  ""BIP148 is very dangerous for exchanges and other business,"" the firm's post reads.  Elsewhere, the company has described its plan to hard fork as a way to save users from the consequences of a split once BIP 148 activates.  One potential problem with the UASF is what's known as a 'reorganization', where user transactions could later be erased from the blockchain history. This could happen if two chains persist temporarily, but then merge back into one chain, erasing transactions that occurred on the 'losing' chain.  The company goes on later to expand on its plan to hard fork (or mine on a different version of bitcoin's blockchain history) in response to the UASF in an effort to make the split more permanent.  The statement read:  ”Bitmain will use some of its own hash rate and work with the developer community to have a contingency plan based on [the user-activated hard fork]. We will develop options for miners to voluntarily join us.”  Bitmain said it will kick off the hard fork, which it called a ""User-Activated Hard Fork (UAHF)"", about 12 hours after the UASF starts. Though, the firm plans to mine it privately for three days before it opens to other miners.  Forthright plan  With each new twist, bitcoin's bitcoin scaling debate is growing more confusing and harder to follow. Moving quickly from proposals as diverse as SegWit, SegWit2x, UASF and now UAHF, the situation so far this year may be too complex to describe in full.  In this light, however, some believe the strength of the UAHF proposal is that it moves the market to a kind of certainty.  Cornell University computer science associate professor Emin Gün Sirer thinks that it's a good sign, at least in that parties are being ""transparent"" about their future plans.  ""The fact that they’re being forthright about it is nice to see. From the perspective of someone who's not on either side [of the debate], this is a welcome development,"" he said, adding:  ""You can look at this and you can plan what to do next. What we need in this space more than anything is, if not a compromise, at least some predictability. That's what we seem to be moving towards.""  Others have argued similarly, noting that the proposal outlines a way to bake in safety features, including resistance to 'replay attacks' should the network split. (This was a problem in the aftermath of ethereum's split into ethereum and ethereum classic last summer).  Bitcoin Unlimited developer David Jerry Chan argued on social media that the change protects the main blockchain from a UASF.  Still other observers think that no outcome is likely and that, at the end of the day, neither side will sacrifice the network's accrued value and market leader position for a small technical shift.  The opposition  As usual, though, reactions to the plan were split, generally between those that support volunteer developer group Bitcoin Core’s technical roadmap and those who don't.  SatoshiLabs CEO Marek Palatinus, the company behind mining pool Slush Pool, reported that the company has been ""monitoring"" the debate, but ""the situation is getting really foggy"".  He argued that he interpreted the blog post to mean that Bitmain will mine a private blockchain that would be governed by the company.  He told CoinDesk in an email:  ""It looks like Bitmain is preparing hard fork to some kind of privately mined blockchain which [means] we cannot offer mining on such [a] chain for our customers. We believe in open development and therefore we consider [it] very unfortunate that such important decisions happen behind [the] close door of [a] private company. We won't call such [a] private blockchain 'the bitcoin'.""  Along these lines, Henry Brade, CEO of European cryptocurrency trading platform Prasos, added that he thinks bitcoin users are resistant to the idea of miners controlling the rules of the network.  While he believes miners play a ""crucial"" role for bitcoin, he said that Bitmain's new roadmap is a sign that the company is trying to dictate the rules of what is supposed to be a ""decentralized"" online currency.  ""It's good that Bitmain released this 'plan' though, because it shows everyone that what they really want is complete control over bitcoin,"" Blockstream CSO Samson Mow said, putting the same idea in a different way.  Others, such as pseudonymous developer Alphonse Pace, argued that the hard fork is a ""complete bluff"", adding to the idea that this is merely an escalation of claims.  ""They make no details about how much hash power to commit to it. It may be so insignificant that it has virtually no blocks, and they won't even publicly show what they are mining because it probably will be embarrassingly small,"" the developer said.  More talk of a UASF  Still, some are taking the event as a sign that the 1st August UASF is working as it's supposed to.  Brade, who favors the UASF, told CoinDesk that he's ""very optimistic"" about this turn of events, arguing that Bitmain would ignore the UASF if they thought it would not work.  ""It's a sign that Bitmain actually thinks the UASF community plan is legit. They are worried that it's going to happen. Apparently they don’t like it,"" he said.  Further, he believes it will further push users towards a UASF, an upgrading mechanism that he favors.  He added:  ""The way they're going about it, I think it's going to only strengthen the resolve of the UASF movement. I think they will get more support. People in bitcoin don’t like the idea that there’s one miner that has a lot of power.""  Indeed, to some, the appeal of a UASF is that it has more of a psychological effect. Pseudonymous developer Shaolinfry, who popularized the idea of a UASF a couple of months ago, argued that the threat of a UASF is what led mining pools to ultimately support SegWit on litecoin, for example.  Further, despite Bitmain arguing that a reorganization is a reason to split off into another chain, others have claimed that safety is the key reason they will upgrade to BIP 148. That way, a user's bitcoins are less likely to disappear in the event of a split.  Either way, this uncertainty (to which Sirer alluded) is a reason why some developers argue that bitcoin companies and users should put a pause on bitcoin transactions at around this time to stay safe.  For one, while 30 or so firms have pledged support for the UASF, the big players that such an upgrading mechanism is contingent on (eg exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken) have not.  Longer-term roadmap  After the hard fork, Bitmain also outlined a farther-looking technical plan for the resulting blockchain if its upgrade works as planned.  The company said that three bitcoin developer groups are working on the UAHF code, which will be ready by 1st July. Long-term plans are to eventually add the scaling optimization SegWit, an RSK sidechain that would port ethereum-style smart contracts to bitcoin, extension blocks, the scalable protocol Bitcoin-NG and other features.  All that said, the company said that it still supports SegWit2x, a recent scaling 'agreement' that boasts the support of most major bitcoin companies and groups that control more than 80% of the mining power. As with the hard fork, response to the roadmap was mixed.  For one, some of the included technologies might be incompatible with what developers are working on right now.  Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark noted that the technology Lumino is not compatible with Lightning Network. Developers of several different versions of the transaction-boosting software drew up standards last October so that all of them would work together.  Still, others are hopeful about the company's long-term roadmap.  Sirer said that he wasn't surprised to see that Bitcoin-NG, a potentially more scalable version of the protocol that he co-architected with other researchers at Cornell University, was included.  ""It shows that they're not just kicking the can down the road. Instead they have a medium to long-term vision for how to really address the scalability problem,"" he said.  Game of bluffs  Still, there are signs that the debate, despite its diversity of proposals, is getting more and more dictated by emotion.  In comments, Haipo Yang, CEO of bitcoin mining pool ViaBTC, for example, continued to voice his support for Bitmain and its proposal on the basis that it might eliminate network congestion and fees.  At play, however, is a complexity of underlying ideas and motives.  Yang, for instance, believes high fees are forcing away potential users (not showcasing that demand is escalating and growing), that developers are seeking too much control (despite largely still backing the same proposal for months), that users should be able to choose from multiple clients (though they technically can and aren't) and that a split into two networks is better for all involved (though that might affect the value of users' funds).  On these issues (and more), there are arguments to take on either side.  But, in this jockeying for control, the migration of investor funds into alternative protocols may prove to be adding pressures to what some are calling a 'power struggle'.  Finally exasperated by the questioning, Yang concluded:    ""I don't know which side [will] win. [A] split to two bitcoin is better, I think.""              The question now may be whether this market change will force action, and if it does, whether users will be caught in any fallout.

42400020,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzRel,1497528014,Swift Says Hackers Can Unite Banks and Blockchain Disruptors,"When the CEO of Swift wants to learn about blockchain, he does it in style.  On stage yesterday in New York, Gottfried Leibbrandt gathered senior executives from some of the largest banks in the world – which also happened to be members of his interbank messaging platform – and put them on stage with the president of one of his own biggest (potential) competitors: blockchain startup Chain.  Speaking on stage in front of 500 senior financial institution leaders, Leibbrandt then deftly navigated his interrogation of representatives from the diverse group of financial institutions including JPMorgan, Citi and CLS.  While there was no doubt that members of the panel viewed one another as potential partners, potential customers and definite competitors, the Swift chief summarized what they all shared in his own closing comments: a common enemy, hackers.  Leibbrandt concluded:  ""We have to be better than them.""  Joining the 'dark side'  For his part, Leibbrandt seemed to be trying to establish a tone of camaraderie throughout his questioning, one that found an unlikely partner in Tom Jessop, the newly appointed president of Chain – a heavily funded blockchain startup ostensibly out to make middlemen (like Swift) unnecessary.  But Chain has struck a more conciliatory tone than some of its rivals such as Ripple, which has set Swift square in its sights as the incumbent to beat. By contrast, all three of Chain's first public clients – Citi, Nasdaq and Visa – are what would be considered legacy financial institutions.  Jessop came up through the ranks at Goldman Sachs as part of the bank's fintech investing team, and was hired by the blockchain firm last year specifically because of his ability to work with incumbents.  In spite of the friendly demeanor on stage, though, Jessop, alluded to criticism that his joining Chain has been perceived as a betrayal of the legacy financial institutions from which he came.  ""People always say to me, 'Why did you go to the dark side?'"" said Jessop. ""Actually, I don't think it's the dark side. I think there’s a lot of work we can do together, and it only happens through partnership.""  Fighting for the system  Leibbrandt's own comments on using blockchain technology to thwart criminal activities echoed earlier statements made by panelist David Puth, CEO of foreign exchange service CLS.  Puth drew laughs from the audience when, following Jessop’s first address to the audience, he described Chain's value proposition, saying: ""You see what I’m up against?""  Puth also joked that running a ""systemically important financial business"" might not be the best business decision, with no pricing control and upstarts trying to take away ""pieces"" of what you offer and selling it to customers in a ""different or simplified way"".  To take on the technological upstarts head-on, Puth last year announced at Swift's Sibos conference that his firm had partnered with IBM to work on its own blockchain solution.  ""When we're competing, when we're going at innovation against the likes of Tom Jessop, we have to think really hard about how we approach things,"" said Puth, who also indicated that his firm was looking for partners similar to Chain.  The enemy of my enemy...  However, the general consensus among the panelists was that whatever the differences between the participants, they were on the same side against criminal adversaries.  To stay one step ahead of bad actors, both the strengths of the legacy infrastructure providers and the innovation of blockchain startups need to be leveraged over the long haul, according to Emma Loftus, managing director and head of global payments at the US division of JPMorgan Treasury Services.  Also speaking at the event, Loftus, whose company recently joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and open-sourced its ethereum-based private ledger called Quorum, positioned partnerships across borders and via consortia as crucial to fighting fraud.  But she went a step further, calling collaboration between blockchain startups and the legacy financial system one of the great challenges slowing widespread adoption.  ""This traverse from traditional to blockchain and the requisite interoperability is why people are taking a very thoughtful approach before jumping in to replace everything,"" said Loftus.  Innovate or lose  For his part, Charles Blauner, global head of information security at Citi – another 'bulge bracket' bank adopting blockchain – had advice of a different sort for industry startups confident that their cryptography is the solution to every financial security problem.  Blauner cautioned blockchain startups that all cryptographic algorithms ""degrade"" over time, and that like the Roman cipher wheels of the past, even the most sophisticated encryption might eventually be hacked by quantum computers and more.  As fintech startups achieve wider adoption, he warned, the prize for successfully hacking them will increase and ""the volume of attacks from potential adversaries will grow"".  In addition to building platforms with easily upgradable cryptographic algorithms and intensely testing the protections, Blauner advocated for even closer collaboration between those who might otherwise be considered competitors.  ""The bad guys, the adversaries … collaborate brilliantly, innovate rapidly,"" said Blauner. ""If we can’t do the same thing, we’re going to lose and so we have to be better than them at innovation. We have to be better than them at collaboration.""  He concluded:  ""Otherwise, statistically speaking they win, we lose.""

The firm's claims  According to a press release and its manual, dibcoin was created by DIB Funding, the parent company of Sunshine Capital, as part of an effort to create a digital asset that could be used as a ""dollar substitute"" for real-world purchases.  As the company would intend to hold 5 billion dibcoins, this increase in capital was meant to help the company quickly acquire assets.  From the white paper:  ""There are only 5 billion dibcoin available and the currency will immediately give Sunshine Capital, Inc massive buying power to make quick acquisitions that will give Sunshine Capital, Inc the ability to list on Nasdaq.”  A quick glance at the company's marketing materials, however, raises some concerns.  Included in public statements are claims that a platform for trading dibcoin, called Livecoin.net, is the ""fourth largest global cryptocurrency exchange"", though this statement is inaccurate.  Further, statements appeared to indicate that the dibcoin launch may have been an attempt for Sunshine Capital to bolster its capital holdings.  ""What the investment world needs to understand is that for every penny dibcoin trades at, it gives our Company approximately $40 million dollars in liquid assets,"" the company wrote in April.  Currently, according to coinmarketcap.com, dibcoin is traded on lesser-known exchanges including Crypto Dao, Livecoin and Crytopia.  Its price dropped in late April from around $1 to $0.10 a little over a week after the company was suspended from trading. It now trades at $0.1747 with a trading volume of $3,320 in the last 24 hours.  Fighting back  Yet, in response to our request for comment, Adam Petty, president and CEO of Sunshine Capital and DIB Funding, argued that the SEC's issue is with the ""nature of the investment"", and that it is a ""crypto currency coin"".  ""If that was the case, then no matter what our answer was or what hoops we jumped through, the chance of the trade suspension being lifted was indeed low,"" Perry wrote.  Further, he vowed that the company will press forward with developing dibcoin as part of its broader business plan.  ""Whether Sunshine Capital is a privately or publicly held company has no impact whatsoever on the success of dibcoin, nor has it changed our business plan,"" he said, concluding:  ""We are still using dibcoin to buy private companies and other assets; and dibcoin will be used as a method of payment in retail outlets.""

42399999,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPbq,1497520815,Bitcoin Exchange Gemini Leverages Banking Charter in Washington State Launch,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has granted Gemini Trust, a New York-licensed bitcoin and ethereum exchange service, permission to serve customers in Washington State.  Maria T Vullo, the NYDFS superintendent, said in a statement that the approval was the result of a collaboration between her agency and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors – a nationwide institution that supervises state-chartered financial institutions.  Gemini is now operating in most US states, with the exception of Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Oregon and Wisconsin.  Key to Gemini's permission to serve Washington was its trust charter, granted in New York in 2015. On application, the exchange's founders, investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, preferred that option to the state's 'BitLicense', arguing it allowed a wider scope of businesses to be served.  The exchange was following in the footsteps of itBit (now Paxos) – the first digital currency firm to seek a charter in the state. At the time, the startup made the argument that a charter would enable it to offer services in more states without applying for licenses state by state.  The approval comes two months after Washington passed Senate Bill 5031, which requires some digital currency businesses to comply with the state money transmitter laws and exchanges to obtain licenses.  The new rules will become effective from 23rd July, 2017.  While a small update, the decision has potentially major implications for cryptocurrency startups that may be classed as money services businesses or money transmitters.  In response to the passage of the bill, Gemini competitors including Poloniex and Bitfinex announced they would no longer do business with customers residing in Washington.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Paxos.

42400004,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPji,1497517212,Traders Plan for Correction as Crypto Market Falls Below $100 Billion,"The total value of all publicly traded cryptocurrencies may be at an all-time high, but trader confidence isn't keeping pace.  After rising more than 1,500% from just over $7bn on 1st January, the market is beginning to show signs that its rapid ascent in 2017 may be slowing.  According data from CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency asset class fell from a high of $117bn yesterday to just under $100bn today, a period in which more than 80 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have seen double-digit declines.  While this decline may just be a speed bump in the world of cryptocurrencies, some analysts report it is sufficient enough that they are beginning to reassess their positions in light of recent activity.  Hedging for a crash?  Indeed, several traders spoke with CoinDesk about the strategies they're currently using to hedge against a potential decline in cryptocurrency prices, with some indicating they're employing simple strategies by reducing their holdings.  For example, Charlie Shrem, a bitcoin entrepreneur and over-the-counter (OTC) trader, is in this camp. He reported he's been buying more bitcoin lately, with ""less than 10%"" of his portfolio in alternative assets.  Marius Rupsys, a cryptocurrency trader and co-founder of fintech startup InvoicePool, took a bolder approach, telling CoinDesk he liquidated his entire cryptocurrency portfolio and has started shorting bitcoin, actively betting its price will go down.  Rupsys predicted:  ""There should be larger correction at some point which will cause altcoins to fall and bitcoin to fall at the same time.""  While several traders identified portfolio management and active trading strategies as ways to hedge against a cryptocurrency price crash, cryptocurrency trader Kong Gao offered a different solution.  One way to hedge against this decline, he said, is to begin mining on alternative asset protocols, and simply hold the coins they receive instead of selling them.  Irrational exuberance  Elsewhere, Rupsys spoke to how he believes the increasing price has been largely caused by highly optimistic newcomers, a prospect that leads him to believe the bull run could soon fade.  ""Many of these new traders are retail traders that have little knowledge of crypto-assets or trading in general,"" Rupsys told CoinDesk.  He added, many people have contacted him interested in getting rich quick.  Tim Enneking, managing director of cryptocurrency hedger fund, Crypto Asset Management, also spoke to the exuberance in the market.  While cryptocurrencies have been experiencing sharp gains, they will reverse direction at some point, Enneking predicted. Crypto Asset Management has set up stop loss orders to liquidate positions in certain cryptocurrencies should these digital assets suffer an ""abrupt crash"", he said.  And according to Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange CryptoCompare, a crash is likely. The attention alternative asset protocols have gained lately have highlighted some of this overconfidence, he said.  While there may be no clear signs yet, Hayter is still putting his money where his mouth is, noting CryptoCompare is going so far as to reallocate its active positions in the market.
