42405868,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepGIQ,1613430715,Pornhub Payment Option Verge Suffers Massive Blockchain Reorganization,"Verge, a small cryptocurrency serving as a payments option on Pornhub, suffered a massive 560,000-block reorganization Monday, according to researchers at Coin Metrics. Verge's Twitter account seemed to acknowledge the attack late Monday.    In ""likely the deepest reorg that has ever taken place in a 'top 100' cryptocurrency,"" the past 200 days of Verge transaction history ""just vanished,"" wrote Coin Metrics network data analyst Lucas Nuzzi.  Verge's official Twitter account said the ""dev team has released a fix"" and everything should be ""business as usual"" in ""13 hours.""  The cryptocurrency previously known as DogecoinDark is no stranger to network attacks. The network suffered similar but less severe exploits in April 2018 and May 2018.  After Monday's reorganization, Verge now stands tied with Ethereum Classic for the number of network exploits. Ethereum Classic suffered three consecutive 51% attacks inside of a month in August 2020.  Verge markets seemed mostly unaffected by the news, trading mostly in tandem with other cryptocurrencies that dipped early Monday and before recovering.  The market's reaction may be due to the fact that no one noticed, since Verge reported barely $50 million in 24-hour trading volume across all markets, according to CoinGecko.

42405886,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepGWC,1613423824,Market Wrap: Crypto Market Cap Breaks $1.5T as Buyers Show Up for the Dip,"Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $48,600 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping less than 1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $45,926 to $49,332.  In a brief market correction Monday morning, over $1.6 billion worth of crypto futures contracts were liquidated over the past 24 hours, per Bybt.  The total cryptocurrency market cap broke $1.5 trillion for the first time late Monday, according to CoinGecko.    Bitcoin has fully pared losses from Sunday’s dip as the leading cryptocurrency fell from around $48,600 to below $46,000 early Monday morning. As of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), bitcoin was trading above $48,600 on Coinbase. But the leading cryptocurrency still has yet to trade above the psychologically significant $50,000 mark.      Much of bitcoin’s choppy price action and its recent dip could be attributed to futures deleveraging. Eager bulls piled into long trades expecting a swift breakout to $50,000 or higher. Funding rates for perpetual bitcoin futures have steadily increased through February, according to market data collected by Skew, with some funding rates reaching their highest levels in the past 12 months.      Confirming this market condition, bitcoin futures saw over $520 million in liquidated contracts over the past 24 hours, according to data from Bybit. The eager buyback after these liquidations hints at the market’s resilient bullishness after resetting over-eager bullish futures traders.      High positive funding rates signal an increase in long positions, whereas negative rates indicate a more bearish sentiment. The market tends to reset when traders, especially in overcrowded derivatives positions, become overly bearish or bullish.      Even though some traders may be dissatisfied by the choppy price action, other market participants are enjoying themselves. Bitcoin miners, for example, hauled in a record $354 million in revenue last week, passing the previous record of $340 million set in mid December 2017. Network fees contributed over 15% of this revenue.    Ether Falls    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday trading around $1,820 and climbing less than 1% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Shortly after setting new record highs above $1,850, ether also suffered a sizable drop, falling almost 10% to roughly $1,660 early on Monday. Over $313 million in ether futures were liquidated in the past 24 hours, per Bybit.      The DeFi sector in aggregate followed suit, per data from Messari. But Ethereum and the various assets in the DeFi ecosystem have since recovered, with DeFi’s aggregate performance up nearly 3% in the past 24 hours, per Messari.      Other alternative cryptocurrencies have also recovered from the market’s dip. FTX’s altcoin index perpetual futures are up nearly 20% from early Monday morning lows, completely retracing the correction.    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Monday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    cosmos + 23.1%  orchid + 9.9%  bitcoin cash + 7.5%    Notable losers:    ethereum classic - 4.8%  algorand - 4.7%  XRP - 3.7%    Equities:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 closed the day up over 550 points at 30,083.

42405885,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepGVD,1613402318,"Institutions Not Worried About Bitcoin Dropping Below $40K, Options Data Shows","Despite bitcoin's rapid $3,000 fall from new record highs seen Sunday, institutions seem confident about the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects.      The cryptocurrency dropped to $47,790 earlier on Monday after just failing to pass the psychological hurdle of $50,000 over the weekend. So far, however, there are few signs of preparations for deeper losses in the options market.      ""There is still an absence of any institutional long-term hedging. In fact, funds continue to take advantage of selling June-December expiry put options at strikes below $40,000,"" Deribit Insights said in a tweet thread explaining the reasons for the price drop and the resulting changes in options market flows.      A put option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors buy puts, paying a premium, when anticipating a price drop and sell (write) put options, collecting a premium, when they foresee price consolidation or a rally.      Currently, large investors are still selling long-term puts below $40,000, showing they are not anticipating an extended/sustained price drop below $40,000.      The absence of any implied volatility spike on the drop from $49,000 to $46,000, as well as the bounce to $48,000, suggests ""comfort and consolidation"" in the mid-$40,000 to $50,000 trading range, Deribit Insights said.      ""The strategy of selling the downside puts is twofold: to get premium (theta) which is higher with higher volatilities, and also because the traders don't think a crash will happen before that expiry,"" said Shaun Fernando, head of risk and product at Deribit, the biggest crypto options exchange by trading volume.      The six-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts relative to calls, remains entrenched in the negative territory, supporting Deribit's assessment. The three-month metric is also hovering below zero, indicating a bullish bias.      Had institutions bought long-term puts to position for a deeper price slide, the six-month put-call skew would have turned positive. Further, increased put buying in the June to December expiry series would have pushed up long-term implied volatility (IV), a measure of investors' expectation of price turbulence.      The six-month IV has dropped from 104.6% to 99.6% in the past 24 hours, while the one- and three-month IV lines are following similar trajectories.

42405873,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepGMM,1613397600,"New Emerging Markets Fund Targets Blockchain, DeFi Startups","Asset management firms Alpha Innovations and Arcanum Capital have launched a $10 million venture capital fund focused on driving blockchain innovation in emerging markets.      The Arcanum Emerging Technologies Fund is to be the first of a series, with an initial close expected in late February, according to a company statement. The fund will provide seed and series A financing to blockchain firms in emerging markets, the companies said in a statement on Monday.      According to James McDowall, a founding partner at Arcanum, the fund is geared towards finding, supporting as well as incubating blockchain startups that are exploring decentralized finance (DeFi) and building on Web 3.0. The fund also hopes to tackle social issues in emerging markets, McDowall said.      “DeFi is hot right now. But there is a lot of financial inclusion to take place in India and other emerging markets, and that's something we're passionate about,” McDowall told CoinDesk.      The fund will initially focus on blockchain projects in India, although not exclusively, McDowall said, adding that Arcanum founding partner Rahul Andra is based in Bangalore, India, where he is working directly with the blockchain communities to find promising projects.      According to McDowall, India has one of the largest pools of talented developers in the world, and with around half of the country’s population under the age of 25, he expects a substantial spike in innovation and entrepreneurship.      “At first glance it's not exciting because it's only $10 million. But we can do so much with that in India,” McDowall said.      Despite India’s lack of regulatory clarity when it comes to crypto, and its recent decision to move forward with a blanket ban on mining, trading and crypto investments in the country, the local blockchain space is attracting substantial capital investment.      In October, bitcoin investor Tim Draper backed a $5 million Series A funding round for Bangalore-based crypto exchange Unocoin. In December, India’s largest crypto exchange CoinDCX raised $13.9 million in Series B funding.      According to Alpha Innovations Chief Operating Officer Nicole Biernat, what drew her towards a partnership with Arcanum was its global team. Arcanum founding partners are based in New York, Zurich, Bangalore and Beijing.      “What's so powerful about that is that each of them have these very deep networks and connections in their respective areas. So there's a lot of different places to draw talent from,” Biernat said.      All of the partners in the fund are veteran blockchain investors, McDowall said, adding that he has been investing in the space since 2016.

42405883,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepGXB,1613388249,3 Reasons Why Bitcoin's Price Just Fell by $3K,"Bitcoin slumped early on Monday, soon after it had looked primed for a convincing move above $50,000.      The top cryptocurrency fell from nearly $49,000 to $45,926 during the early Asian hours and was last seen changing hands near $47,790 – down 1.8% on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The decline surprised many investors, as a notable all-time high milestone had looked on the cards amid optimism generated by the recent wave of institutional adoption.      So what happened? Here are three reasons that may explain the sudden price pullback.    1. Funding stress    ""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, in general, looked overheated, and the Asian session drop was likely a 'funding reset' needed for a sustained move above $50,000,"" Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk.      Indeed, the cost of holding long positions in bitcoin's perpetual futures market, also known as the funding rate, rose to a 12-month high of 0.109% on Sunday, indicating excess bullish leverage, or overheating, in the market.      The average funding rate began climbing at the end of January and surged to multi-month highs in the wake of Tesla's disclosure of bitcoin investments last Monday. This suggests that the recent rally from below $40,000 was primarily driven by leverage on derivatives. As such, there was always the risk of funding reset.      The price drop has liquidated over $300 million worth of bitcoin long positions so far today, according to data source Coinalyze – that's roughly 30% of the total long liquidations of $1.33 billion observed in the crypto market.      Many alternative cryptocurrencies such as XRP, XLM, LINK, ADA and some decentralized finance-linked tokens suffered double-digit price drops in the Asian session, overshadowing bitcoin's 6% decline. According to Dibb, the wider sell-off added to bearish pressures around bitcoin.      According to a tweet from market analyst Josh Rager, the altcoin rally had turned ""euphoric"" last week, meaning a price drop was overdue.    2. Institutional demand weakened    The Coinbase premium indicator from analytics firm CryptoQuant turned negative on Sunday in a sign of weak demand from large investors.      The indicator measures the spread between Coinbase Pro's BTC/USD pair and Binance's BTC/USDT pair, which includes the USD-linked stablecoin tether. The indicator is widely followed by traders, as Coinbase Pro is considered synonymous with high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors. A positive spread implies strong institutional inflows and vice versa.      ""The premium fell nearly to -$80 during Sunday's early European hours and remained largely neutral when the price was ranging between $48,000 to $49,000,"" CryptoQuant CEO Ki-Young Ju told CoinDesk. ""Weak spot inflows signaled scope for correction.""      Bitcoin's rally from early October lows near $10,000 has been largely fueled by increased demand from high-net-worth individuals and institutions. The cryptocurrency consistently traded at a Coinbase premium of around $100 throughout the four-month bull market, with the few instances of negative premiums paving the way for price pullbacks.      Market analyst Joseph Young cited negative a Coinbase premium and stagnant Grayscale inflows as price-bearish developments on Sunday while pointing to $48,000 as the level to beat for the bulls.      The seven-day average of Grayscale inflows peaked in mid-January and has been trending south ever since (barring a rise Friday), according to data source Glassnode. While retail investors trade in the spot market, many institutional investors gain exposure to bitcoin through the regulated Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).      New York-based Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.    3. Chart-driven factors    The recent rise from $30,000 to $49,000 lacked volume support on prominent exchanges such as Coinbase.      The 10-day moving average of daily volume has been declining since early February. A low-volume price rise is often short-lived and prone to sudden pullbacks, similar to the one seen early today.    Broader bias remains bullish    Bitcoin's latest price slide is typical of pullbacks observed during the previous bull markets, and the path of least resistance remains to the higher side.      ""We're probably entering (I think) a brief and minor correction now, but we're still in the midst of a violent bull run that will soon be more violent,"" Ari Paul, CIO of BlockTower Capital, tweeted.      Also read: Bitcoin Sets New All-Time High of $49.7K, Putting $50K Within Striking Distance      According to analysts, more institutions may soon emulate Tesla's move to diversify cash holdings into bitcoin, leading to a convincing move above $50,000.      At press time, the perpetual funding rate has normalized to 0.05% and the Coinbase premium has recovered to $50.

In November, Hong Kong’s Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) said its new framework would put all digital asset exchanges under the oversight of the Securities and Futures Commission and limit trading in cryptocurrencies to professional investors only.  If implemented, the new regime would encourage retail investors to seek out unlicensed and peer-to-peer platforms, according to Global Digital Finance (GDF), an industry body representing cryptocurrency firms including OKCoin, BitMEX, and Coinbase.  GDF added this would raise the financial risk for retail investors seeking such alternative trading venues.  “Restricting cryptocurrency trading to professional investors only is different to what we have seen in other jurisdictions such as Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S., where retail investors can buy and sell virtual assets,” said Malcolm Wright, chairman of GDF’s advisory council, said in a report from the South China Morning Post on Monday.
