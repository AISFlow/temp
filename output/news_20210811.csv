Valkyrie's filing follows less than a week after remarks at the Aspen Security Forum by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who noted that he would favor ETFs based on bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).  Atlanta-based asset manager Invesco has already applied for an ETF that would include exposure to futures, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Canadian bitcoin ETFs.

42397088,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYce3,1628714829,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rallies Despite Cooler Inflation Data,"The Labor Department reported Wednesday that ​​the consumer price index posted a 0.5% month-to-month gain, compared with a 0.9% increase in June. The price rose 5.4% from the year-ago level.      Despite cooler – but still high – inflation data in July and the U.S. Senate’s passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that could impose certain taxes and restrictions on the cryptocurrency sector, bitcoin’s price climbed to $46,502 on Wednesday, its highest level since mid-May, with retail investors returning to the market. The cryptocurrency was trading at $46,433 as of press time, up 2.45% on the day.      “The market isn't expecting the language in the Senate bill to progress as is through the House and into law, which I also agree with,” Jeffery Wang, head of Americas at crypto services Amber Group, wrote to CoinDesk in an email. “I think once all is said and done, we will have more palatable rules for the crypto industry.""    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $46,566, +2.1%  Ether (ETH) $3255.7, +3.2%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4447.7, +0.25%  Gold: $1752.4, +1.35%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.332%, compared with 1.347% on Tuesday    “Bitcoin has taken a major leg up in the last few weeks. In our past notes we had anticipated a rally till mid of August,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta exchange, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      “We believe that the market should take a breather here. We expect the price to consolidate for some time in the $40K-$45K range before taking decisive action toward the end of August, early September,” Balani wrote. “The volatility continues to trade rich and there is interest to write the upside beyond 50K for Aug and September.”      Meanwhile, the total cryptocurrency market cap has topped $2 trillion for the first time since May, according to CoinGecko.    Bitcoin traders might be more focused on inflation than crypto taxes    The U.S. Senate's passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill this week with measures considered onerous for the cryptocurrency industry has done little to halt bitcoin's nearly 60% price rally over the past few weeks.      Maybe that's because the latest moves by lawmakers in the world's largest economy illustrate how little appetite there is among top officials to curb the elevated spending that has fueled a run-up in U.S. government debt to unprecedented levels of over $28 trillion.      Crypto traders might be betting that the extra spending could spur inflation, potentially bolstering bitcoin's appeal as a bulwark against dollar debasement. The Federal Reserve has created trillions of dollars in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic to help absorb the additional U.S. Treasury borrowing; the central bank's holdings of Treasury bonds has increased by about $3 trillion since early 2020, to $5.3 trillion as of last week.      And despite speculation that the Fed might move to taper its bond purchases of $120 billion per month later this year (including $80 billion a month of U.S. Treasuries), the central bank may need to finance additional government borrowing. The Congressional Budget Office projected in July that budget deficits over the next decade could total $12 trillion, pushing the government's debt load, expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, to 106%, by 2031. A decade ago, that ratio stood at just 63%.      The CBO has said that the bipartisan infrastructure bill could swell projected deficits over the next decade by an additional $256 billion. That's equivalent to another four months of Fed Treasury purchases at the current pace.      And there may be additional upward pressure on budget deficits after the Democratic-led Senate on Wednesday approved a $3.5 trillion budget framework with provisions for extra spending on family services, health and environment programs. According to the New York Times, the effort could ""create the largest expansion of the federal safety net in nearly six decades.""      Much of that has been in the works for a while. Last year, bitcoin's price quadrupled as then- presidential candidate Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump in a Democratic government takeover billed as the ""Blue wave."" But there's a growing sense now that U.S. finances might be reaching a point of no return.      ""You're putting in motion a government that nobody's grandchild can ever afford to pay,"" said U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, according to the New York Times.      Based on the recent years' trend, the Federal Reserve might end up paying for a lot of it by printing money.    Speaking of inflation…    The U.S. consumer price index jumped by 5.4% in the 12 months through July, the same pace as June and slightly exceeding the 5.3% increase expected by economists, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.      Despite the latest 12-month increase being on par with the fastest inflation in more than a decade, some analysts saw the stabilization as a sign that price pressures from the economy's reopening might be easing.      ""While I don't think a small decline is a game changer, as far as monetary policy is concerned, it may have been had we continued to see an acceleration, or evidence of more worrying price pressures. Instead, we can all breathe a little easier,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for the brokerage firm Oanda, wrote in an email.      The July CPI report isn't likely to have a major influence on the Federal Reserve's high-level discussions over when and how quickly to start tapering its unprecedented monetary stimulus. In last month’s Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted that the central bank is aiming to make gains in its goal to reach maximum employment before tapering.      Many bitcoin traders closely track headline inflation numbers in the event that the digital asset becomes a hedge against inflation because of its limited supply cap at a time when the dollar might be losing some of its purchasing power.    Hacker giving money back?    An address associated with the hacker who drained Poly Network of potentially hundreds of millions of dollars on Tuesday has started to return the funds, CoinDesk's Eliza Gkritsi reports.      The transfers came after Poly Network first agitated for the blacklisting of the exploiter's wallet addresses and then set up multi-signature addresses to receive any returned funds.      One surprise is that the news of the exploit didn't rattle digital-asset markets too much.      ""Reports late last night of a $600m hack have done nothing to shake sentiment in the cryptocurrency space, despite it being the largest hack in history,"" Oanda's Erlam wrote. ""While a massive story, it seems traders aren't concerned, something that perhaps we wouldn't have seen a few years ago.""      The blockchain research firm Chainalysis published its own analysis: ""While we certainly don’t expect every cryptocurrency hack to end with the attacker returning the stolen funds, in this case, it appears Poly Network will get its money back and has also learned about an important vulnerability its team can now patch up. Ultimately, the ecosystem will be stronger for this,"" the report said.

42397078,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYcSF,1628714769,"Returned Funds, Blacklisted Tokens Raise More Questions Than Answers in DeFi's Biggest Hack","Chatter about the largest hack in decentralized finance (DeFi) history has only elevated, after the attacker or attackers returned at least $342 million worth of drained funds back to Poly Network, the DeFi platform that was hacked.      Now the crypto community is raising moral questions about how involved centralized players such as Binance and Circle should be when it comes to limiting monetary damage in the realm of cyberattacks on DeFi platforms.      Others are asking whether an attacker or attackers like those in Poly Network’s case should be pardoned or even praised as they slowly return funds back to the protocols they preyed upon.    Read more: Cross-Chain DeFi Site Poly Network Hacked; Hundreds of Millions Potentially Lost    At press time, more than $342 million worth of tokens – including USDC, BUSD, SHIB and FEI – have been returned to Poly Network through the Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, data show. The attacker or attackers started returning funds at approximately 08:47 UTC on Wednesday, and the latest return came at 19:06 UTC on the same day with roughly $84 million worth of USDC sent back to Poly Network on Polygon.    Centralization vs. decentralization    Despite the fanfare surrounding the attack on Poly Network, some market observers said it showcased the advantage of having at least some degree of centralization in DeFi.      As Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino quickly responded on Twitter that the stablecoin issuer froze about $33 million related to the Poly Network hack, many questioned the inaction from Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is powered by centralized exchange Binance, and Circle, the company behind dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC.      A BSC spokesperson told CoinDesk that BSC is a “decentralized ecosystem where anyone and everyone can build on,” hinting that BSC cannot do much to roll back DeFi exploits on top of it.      Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was more philosophical: “Unpopular opinion: nothing is risk free,” he said in a Twitter thread Tuesday, adding:    “While we can't freeze funds on blockchains, if those funds land on our CEX [centralized exchange], we will (try to) freeze them. So, we have a lot of blockchain analysis to do. Nothing is easy. We try.”    The response from Zhao and BSC came in the context of Binance retaining a significant degree of control over BSC. BSC’s security algorithm, known as Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA), is controlled by 21 node operators, who are elected by Binance Coin (BNB) holders. Binance is one of the largest holders of the BNB tokens, and so it still has significant sway over BSC, making the network more centralized than competing blockchains.      Lianfeng Zhang, chief security officer at blockchain security firm SlowMist, told CoinDesk that while BSC has fewer validators, a decision like freezing funds still needs to be voted on by the BSC community and the process can be “troubling and slow.”      Zhang also said that compared with Tether, USDC requires more compliance with little flexibility. Therefore, when an attack like the one on Poly Network occurs, it is almost impossible for Circle to act as fast as Tether did.      Circle didn't respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.      Paxos, the company that jointly administers BUSD with Binance, another dollar-pegged stablecoin that is part of the stolen funds, told CoinDesk it is currently ""not doing anything"" with blacklisting the involved tokens.    White-hat hacker?    As the attacker or attackers started returning the drained funds, it appears they also had time to conduct a question-and-answer on the Ethereum blockchain.      The attacker or attackers allegedly wrote in one message embedded on a transaction on Ethereum that after spotting the bug on Poly Network, they ended up attacking the platform because they “can trust nobody.”      “I take the responsibility to expose the vulnerability before any insiders [are] hiding and exploiting it,” the message continued.    Read more: Crypto Panhandlers Beg Poly Network Attacker for Share of $613M Haul    With the attacker or attackers becoming more engaged with the crypto community and having returned at least part of the funds, some members of the crypto world praised them as so-called white-hat hackers, a type of computer expert who ensures the security of a protocol by identifying and attacking its vulnerabilities.      In the Q&A, the attacker or attackers claimed they thought about informing Poly Network's staff about the bug but were afraid of a potential “traitor” who could be lured by the amount of money that was up for grabs.      However, according to Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs, it is still too early to make a conclusion about the motives of the hacker or hackers.      “If it turns out that these attackers did have benign ambitions and that they were testing the infrastructure or testing the defenses of a DeFi protocol, this was not the way to do it,” Redbord, who previously worked in the U.S. Department of the Treasury as a senior advisor on terrorism and financial intelligence, said.      “Essentially, what you have here is people who lost their belief … hundreds of millions of dollars and potentially life savings [were taken],” he added.

42397073,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYcNK,1628712880,"By Taxing Crypto, the US Government Has Accepted It's Here to Stay","Crypto just experienced a major watershed – and it’s time to recognize the silver lining.      Crypto suddenly became part of the U.S. Senate's debate over the infrastructure bill, and the outcome in my view is the greatest regulatory certainty crypto has ever had in the U.S.      Out of seemingly nowhere, the infrastructure bill introduced an estimated $28 billion tax on the crypto industry. Many in the industry expressed outrage and concern. The crypto-related amendments that were introduced and debated in the Senate focused on a battle over how tax reporting will work and whom it should apply to.    Jeff Bandman is a former senior official at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission who led the agency’s initial virtual currency and blockchain work and was founding director of LabCFTC. He is currently principal of Bandman Advisors.    Here’s the silver lining – and for me a huge “Aha” moment. If the U.S. government thinks it is going to raise $28 billion in taxes from the crypto industry in the next 10 years, it means crypto is here to stay. It means crypto is going to be a new cornerstone of the U.S. economy.      Let me say this another way – the government is going into partnership with the crypto industry.      The government didn’t abolish tobacco – it taxes it. The government taxes alcohol. The government taxes capital gains and income, and all kinds of other things. It does not tax illegal narcotics, it does not tax prostitution (except in Nevada). And once the government gets used to receiving tax revenue, it is almost unprecedented for that to stop.    If the U.S. government thinks it is going to raise $28 billion in taxes from the crypto industry in the next 10 years – this means crypto is here to stay.    My first “Aha! Moment” that crypto was here to stay occurred back in 2013-2014, when the government seized copious quantities of bitcoin from the illegal Silk Road criminal enterprise.      And what did the government do with all those bitcoins? It auctioned them off to the American people. Wow!      When I teach my introductory courses on crypto-assets law, policy and regulation, in the very first class, I ask the students this riddle: How is bitcoin like a speedboat? (Actually I put up photos of both.)      There is no single right answer, and the responses are clever and creative. It is liquid. It is volatile. It is powerful. It moves rapidly, it moves frictionlessly. Your two happiest days are the day you buy it and the day you sell it.      The answer we arrive at is that the government auctions off seized bitcoin just like it auctions off other seized items – boats, cars, houses and furniture. The government does not auction off narcotics or AK-47s.      That U.S. government auction of the Silk Road bitcoins told me that bitcoin was not even in a gray area where it might be made illegal. If the government was selling it, it was going to be legal and stay legal. And since that time, there have been many more auctions by the U.S. and other governments around the world – this has become so routine that government bitcoin auctions are not even considered newsworthy anymore.      So this August, I hope the infrastructure bill gets refined and strikes the right balance. It does matter. So far it has not been fixed to address the industry’s concerns. But even if it gets it wrong, we have crossed a major watershed in the United States. And once we cross it, we are not going back.      This is great news for the crypto industry and for the next phase of innovation to deliver powerful benefits to consumers and society as the U.S. continues its leadership.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | REGULATION,Jeff Bandman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/11/by-taxing-crypto-the-us-government-has-accepted-its-here-to-stay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ddcf5537715ccd95db235341f59d22e71661649-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42397091,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYcf2,1628710286,Inversores institucionales regresan a bitcoin a pesar de posibles impuestos para las criptomonedas en Estados Unidos,"El creciente control que legisladores y reguladores ejercen sobre los mercados de criptomonedas —incluido el debate sobre impuestos a las criptomonedas incluido en un proyecto de ley estadounidense— puede estar asustando a los inversores minoristas, pero no a los institucionales, según datos de blockchain brindados por Glassnode.      Estos grandes inversores, representados por transacciones de grandes montos en dólares, impulsaron las ganancias del precio de bitcoin casi 20% desde la semana pasada, según informó la empresa de datos de blockchain con sede en Berlín. Varios analistas afirman que la tendencia muestra que estas instituciones se están centrando más en las ventajas de la criptomoneda que en los posibles obstáculos.      ""Los inversores se fijan más en lo positivo en torno a la regulación que en lo negativo"", dijo Joel Kruger, estratega de criptomonedas en el exchange institucional LMAX Digital, y agregó que el gobierno de Estados Unidos es consciente de que hay una parte del segmento cripto que necesita más clarificación.    Read this article in English.    El volumen de transacciones en la blockchain de Bitcoin con valores de al menos $1 millón ha aumentado un 10% desde principios de agosto y significa casi el 70% del valor total transferido.      Esta métrica de blockchain muestra el aumento de las actividades institucionales en la red de Bitcoin porque ""los inversores minoristas rara vez mueven transacciones [con valores de al menos $1 millón] en una escala como para crear tal dominio"", dijo un analista de blockchain en Glassnode que responde al nombre de ""Checkmate"".      ""El creciente dominio también se correlaciona con las salidas [masivas] de Coinbase desde diciembre de 2020, que también asignamos a probables instituciones estadounidenses"", agregó el analista.      Mientras tanto, las transacciones de pequeño tamaño han disminuido su participación en el mercado general, como se muestra en el siguiente gráfico. Las transacciones valoradas en menos de $1 millón han caído a alrededor del 30-40% del total del mercado, cuando en julio de 2020 representaban el 70% del total.      El reciente optimismo de los inversores institucionales se produce mientras el mercado de criptomonedas sigue los intensos desarrollos políticos y regulatorios en todo el mundo, incluida una disposición de información fiscal de $28 mil millones muy debatida en el proyecto de ley de infraestructura de $1 billón en los Estados Unidos y una ofensiva en Europa y otras regiones contra Binance, el más grande exchange de criptomonedas del mundo por volumen de operaciones.      A pesar de la posibilidad de una mayor supervisión regulatoria, los inversores institucionales son optimistas sobre el futuro de bitcoin, según analistas y expertos del sector.      ""En general, las instituciones verían con buenos ojos una regulación clara y justa"", dijo Andrew Tu, ejecutivo de la firma de trading cuantitativo Efficient Frontier. ""La reciente subida de precios de la última semana ha demostrado que el mercado no reacciona con fuerza a las preocupaciones sobre la regulación, en contraposición a la aprobación real de la legislación"".      En el último desarrollo del proyecto de ley de infraestructura, llevado a cabo el lunes, el senador estadounidense Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) presentó una objeción a una enmienda de acuerdo sobre una disposición de impuestos a las criptomonedas. La enmienda habría eximido a los validadores de transacciones de criptomonedas de una definición ampliada de ""broker"".      Kruger dijo que una mayor regulación ayuda a validar la industria.      ""Esto significa que la industria está siendo reconocida y esto, en última instancia, ayuda a la aceptación y adopción"", dijo Kruger.      Otras personas también dijeron que el mercado de criptomonedas se ha acostumbrado más a las noticias que provienen de los reguladores a medida que la industria madura.      ""El mercado de las criptomonedas está muy acostumbrado a las preocupaciones regulatorias; en especial, los poseedores de criptomonedas que llevan mucho tiempo en el mercado y que han visto múltiples ciclos de incertidumbre regulatoria"", dijo Tu.      De hecho, sobre una base media de 14 días, el número promedio de días que cada BTC transaccionado permaneció inactivo o sin moverse ha aumentado ligeramente de 7 a 10 días, según Glassnode, lo que significa que algunos poseedores de bitcoin de largo tiempo no están optando por liquidez en esta etapa.    Los fundamentos del mercado, más fuertes y saludables    En lugar de centrarse en las incertidumbres regulatorias, los inversores institucionales han destacado el fortalecimiento de los fundamentos del mercado de bitcoin como una justificación para su optimismo.      ""Las preocupaciones regulatorias no afectan a bitcoin tanto como a otras criptomonedas, y el sentimiento detrás de bitcoin ha estado mostrando signos de cambio desde hace un par de semanas"", dijo Noelle Acheson, jefa de Market Insights en Genesis. (Genesis es propiedad de la empresa matriz de CoinDesk, Digital Currency Group).      Por su parte, la oferta ilíquida de bitcoin, o el saldo en manos de entidades sin liquidez, recientemente alcanzó un récord, lo que significa que la criptomoneda más antigua tiene una debilidad por ese lado.      Las tasas de financiación del mercado de derivados perpetuos han vuelto a ser positivas después de haber sido negativas durante la mayor parte de junio y julio.      Calculada cada ocho horas, la tasa de financiación se refiere al costo de mantener posiciones largas/cortas en el mercado de contratos perpetuos de bitcoin (futuros sin vencimiento). La métrica es utilizada por los exchanges que ofrecen perpetuals para equilibrar el mercado y orientar sus valores hacia el precio al contado.      Una tasa de financiación positiva significa que el mercado está orientado al alza. Mientras tanto, una tasa de financiación negativa implica un posicionamiento de mercado bajista.      Como informó CoinDesk, el ratio de posiciones abiertas de put-call (compra-venta) de bitcoin también cayó recientemente al nivel más bajo de 2021 debido al aumento de la actividad en las ventas, o apuestas alcistas.      Al cierre de esta edición, bitcoin era negociado a $46.475,04, un 3,26% más que en las últimas 24 horas, según CoinDesk 20.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,"Andrés Engler, Muyao Shen",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/11/inversores-institucionales-regresan-a-bitcoin-a-pesar-de-posibles-impuestos-para-las-criptomonedas-en-estados-unidos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00f0b37cb97a36571427a266463dbe32f4744279-1996x1330.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42397082,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYcY9,1628703734,The Inevitability of Crypto in Iraq,"Cryptocurrency was born out of a financial crisis. It was a proposed solution to the problems caused by, and inherent in, the worldwide banking system as well as centralized authorities.      Satoshi Nakamoto's vision, as set out in the Bitcoin white paper, was in some ways too good to be true at the time. The idea of a decentralized peer-to-peer digital cash was so obscure that had it not been for an elite of tech geeks who knew the real value of this technology, it would have been dismissed. Early adoption remained slow until more people realized the promises of crypto and its underlying blockchain technology.    Abdurrahman Bapir is the founder of Kurdcoin, the first and largest crypto brokerage in Iraq. He is a master's student in Politics and Economics of the Middle East at Kings College London.CoinDesk's Crypto State: Middle East virtual event is Aug. 11.    More than a decade after bitcoin first appeared, adoption of the cryptocurrency shows that the technology is in the early stages of revolutionizing finance and the world, providing solutions for the unbanked and banked alike. Nowhere is this more on display than in Iraq, which now has for the first time become a bridge that connect the unbanked in Iraq to the international economy in an otherwise financially disconnected part of the world.      However, the widespread adoption of crypto in Iraq has come up against a host of obstacles facing both crypto users and businesses.      In early 2017, when my team and I had just launched Kurdcoin as the first and only cryptocurrency brokerage in Iraq and Kurdistan Region, the number of people who knew and used cryptocurrencies was in the tens and hundreds. The community in the country has grown exponentially ever since.      During the past four years, we have directly provided service to thousands of clients, and there are many Iraqi Telegram and Facebook peer-to-peer trading groups with thousands of members. The crypto use cases have been growing as well.      One of the main impediments for blockchain adoption in Iraq has been the sustained hostile attitude of the authorities toward cryptocurrencies without exceptions. During the 2017 bull run, the Iraqi Central Bank issued a statement prohibiting the use of cryptocurrencies – a stance that has remained unchanged to date. Similarly, earlier this year, the Ministry of Interior of the Kurdistan Regional Government issued a statement warning all foreign exchange and money transfer offices to stop brokering cryptocurrencies or they will face legal action.      The outlawing of digital currencies and the absence of a coherent regulatory framework have come at a cost to both users and the local economy, as they have forced people to seek crypto investment opportunities in something of a black market with no accountability or regulatory oversight.      Thousands of people have fallen victim to crypto scams, Ponzi schemes and other forms of fraud. Tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars of peoples' money have been stolen by foreign agents or companies posing as legitimate businesses who require to be paid in crypto. That has slowly drained cash from the economy and mostly from already economically troubled regions.      Less than a month ago, for instance, the website of a company calling itself Praetorian Group International, or PGI, disappeared and its team ran away with north of $40 million of investors' money. It's just the latest in a string of multimillion dollar Ponzi schemes that turn crypto dreams into nightmares.      A vicious cycle is created in which the government banned crypto because it's used in fraud, and fraudsters manage to continue to use it because it's not regulated. The only way to break this cycle is by introducing a bill to regulate digital currencies and requiring all crypto businesses to be registered.      Another limitation in Iraq is a general lack of knowledge about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology within both the government and wider society. At the governmental level, this lack of knowledge has led it to view cryptocurrencies in a completely negative light and mainly as a means for money laundering, fraud and online piracy.      A report by Deloitte about Iraq has underlined that concern, stating that “instead of pushing the cryptocurrencies to the periphery of financial systems, the central banks and other regulators as well as market authorities must play a leading role in making them mainstream.”      On the societal level, the problem of general financial and crypto illiteracy means people make poor, uninformed financial and investment decisions and are unable to use cryptocurrencies to their full potential. If cryptocurrency is ever featured at prime time on Kurdish satellite channels, the hosts and participants often show a disappointing lack of knowledge, to the point that some of them do not know the difference between a local scam coin and bitcoin.      We have tried to mitigate some of these challenges by pushing for regulation through major law firms, increasing knowledge about cryptocurrencies and spreading awareness regarding crypto scams and risks in order to create a better environment for crypto users in the country.      Further, major exchanges like Binance, Crypto.com and Coinbase do not provide services in Iraq.      Despite these roadblocks, cryptocurrency use in the country has been constantly increasing. Who can deny the largely untapped market potential?    Read more: Crypto Adoption in Middle East Will Come From Unstable Nations | Nimrod Lehavi    Iraq's population of more than 40 million is mostly young, with more than 60% under the age of 25. There are more than 37 million mobile cellular subscriptions and internet penetration is above 75%. Although e-commerce, e-banking and digital payments are still major underdeveloped sectors, many young people pay for online shopping and subscriptions with crypto.      Similarly, Iraqi population is largely unbanked, with fewer than 1 in 10 adults having a bank account. Many seem to have turned to crypto as an alternative both for investment and as a store of value, because it's better and safer in several ways than storing cash up at home. Ignoring the warnings from authorities, businesses are also beginning to use cryptocurrency for transferring money within the country and outside, and companies and wealthy individuals are adding crypto to their investment portfolios.      Despite a number of challenges, mass crypto adoption in Iraq seems to be inevitable because of the financial opportunities, ease of using crypto for payments and other applications.

Even the guy who killed a last-ditch attempt to fix it yesterday, Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, said he actually supports the fix.      So, yeah, this is nobody’s fault, nobody’s responsibility. I’m sure everyone in the Senate really gave it their honest, well-intended best. I’m sure passing laws so broken they’re simultaneously industry-destroying and unenforceable is a once-in-a-lifetime event in that august body. I’m sure they’re not just making it all up as they go along for the sake of political convenience.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    And yet there it is, in the guts of the huge infrastructure bill, a tax reporting requirement for “any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person.” As the industry has repeatedly warned, that language could rope in a wide range of unintended players, including miners and software developers who have no ability to meet its requirements.      So what happens next? Should every crypto business in the United States start packing their bags to move overseas so that they don’t have to comply with an impossible law?      Luckily, there’s still time, though the solutions from here will be even more challenging and complex. The infrastructure bill now goes to the House, where it will be considered and debated for more weeks or, more likely, months. After that, it will be translated into regulatory language by the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department. At both of those stages, there are opportunities to mitigate the potential damage of the measure.      Jerry Brito, whose crypto lobbying group Coin Center took the lead on the effort to fix the Senate language, believes there’s hope for revisions in the House, saying that “we can try to get a whole new amendment from scratch that can address our concerns.” Even if those efforts are successful, though, the House and Senate versions of the bill would have to be reconciled, itself a long process with unpredictable results.      Even if the House revision effort fails and the current language becomes law, it must then be translated into specific rules by the IRS and the Treasury Department. That usually involves a public feedback period and is likely to make clear what specific entities are affected by the language.      “Even after this whole legislative process is done, there are often significant opportunities for industry and taxpayers to provide their input into the rules and regulation,” said Rochelle Hodes, Principal, Washington National Tax at the consulting firm Crowe LLP.      Hodes also thinks statements Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) has made about the provision will influence how it is interpreted by regulators. On Aug. 3, before the fracas turned into a total meltdown, Portman wrote on Twitter that the measure “does not impose new reporting requirements on software developers, crypto miners, node operators or other non-brokers.” On Monday, he reiterated that clarification before Congress. A co-sponsor, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), also stated on record that the measure was intended to target “businesses,” which could help shield protocols from rulemaking.     Read more: With Crypto Tax Rules, Conservatives Chose Tax Cheats Over Free Enterprise | David Z Morris    According to Hodes, such statements have a significant role in shaping how a law is implemented. “[The IRS and Treasury] are going to take into account not just the legislative language, but legislative history … a statement from one of the sponsors of the provision on the floor of Congress that gets into the congressional record, that is fairly persuasive legislative history.”      That said, Hodes warns that such statements shouldn’t be relied on to get the desired rulemaking result.      Statements of intent that affected rulemaking would remain significant long-term. According to Hodes, regulators regularly delve into centuries-old records to clarify the original intent of the drafters. Fifty years from now, when all involved senators have gone on to their rewards, their statements this week will still matter.      There is no easy final summation of what this all means. We’re in limbo, and things could go any number of directions. With a lot of work and uncertainty ahead, now is a moment to take a deep breath and prepare for months more of busy work trying to fix something legislators swear they didn’t even really mean to break in the first place.

With full deployment of a fleet of more than 80,000 Antminers, 95% of which will be the latest generation S19 model, the company forecast total hash capacity of 7.7 EH/s by Q4 next year.  Riot expects to consume 257 MW of energy, of which 206 MW will be deployed at the new facility.

The company, which describes itself as a “Fidelity for millennials and Gen Z,” currently offers three “strategies” – Titan’s version of an index fund – for investors to gain exposure to the stock market. It manages approximately $500 million for over 30,000 clients.      But with its new product, Titan Crypto, the investing app is expanding its offerings into the crypto realm with a basket of leading coins. Titan’s actively managed crypto offering will feature a collection of five to 10 cryptocurrencies that, according to Titan co-CEO Clay Gardner, will include bitcoin and ether as well as altcoins like Cardano’s ADA and Stellar’s XLM.      As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, retail investors are clamoring to get involved. But for some, the process of setting up a wallet and navigating the crypto ecosystem can be overwhelming. User-friendly investing platforms like Robinhood, PayPal and now Titan have sprung up offering various levels of crypto exposure to crypto-curious retail investors.      Titan Crypto’s investment team, led by analyst Gritt Trakulhoon, will make monthly adjustments to the allocations and coins contained in the crypto portfolio based on performance.      Titan did not tell CoinDesk where the actual crypto would be custodied. (For example, PayPal uses Paxos to power its crypto services.)      Gardner told CoinDesk that over time, Titan hopes to expand its crypto offerings to include decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as well as add more features for users including staking and lending.

42397085,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYca7,1628692060,Fitch Says Germany's ‘Spezialfonds’ Investing in Crypto Face Liquidity Risk,"A German law that allows Spezialfonds (special funds) to allocate as much as 20% of their assets to cryptocurrencies could pose a liquidity risk, Fitch Ratings said.    Spezialfonds are open only to institutional investors and had an estimated €2 trillion ($1.17 trillion) of assets under management at end-March 2021.  By bringing cryptocurrencies into the traditional, regulated financial system, the law passed earlier this year could also result in increased exposure to crypto assets for retail investors, whose insurance policies and retirement savings are managed by those institutions.  “If price volatility triggers trading breaks for exchange-traded cryptocurrency assets, this could make it more difficult for managers of cryptocurrency-exposed Spezialfonds to meet investors’ redemption requests or other obligations,” Fitch said.  The ratings company said it does not believe that allocations to crypto assets will reach close to the 20% allowed because Spezialfonds institutions are “traditionally risk-averse” in their approach to asset allocation.  If the funds were to invest the full amount allowed, Fitch calculates maximum crypto-asset investments of up to €360 billion ($422 billion) – which compares with bitcoin’s current market capitalization of around $860 billion.

The U.S.’s largest cryptocurrency exchange posted $1.9 billion in transaction revenue, outpacing the expected $1.57 billion. Its take rate – or retail trading revenue divided by retail trading volumes – was 1.24%, up from 1.21% and the first increase in the metric in the past four quarters.  But the company noted in its guidance that monthly transacting users (MTUs) in July had declined significantly to 6.3 million, and trading volume was only $57 billion in the month. While August’s numbers were slightly higher than this, Coinbase warned that MTUs and trading volume would be lower in Q3 compared to Q2.  COIN was volatile after results were released yesterday after the close, as investors parsed the earnings report.  “When people saw the earnings hit, the stock was up and when they looked at the future guidance for monthly transacting users and trading volume, the stock turned back,” said Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau.  But Lau added that “when people digested the earnings report and call, they realized there were way more positives than negatives. If you don’t transact in 28 days, they don’t count you as an MTU. Because bitcoin’s price was boring in July, traders didn’t engage. … For me, I do see multiple catalysts for driving up MTUs in the second half of the year.”  Coinbase shares are now up about 17% from their reference price of $250, but down around 28% from their opening trading price of $381 in mid-April.

Launched in 2018 as the first free and open-source wallet for the privacy coin monero on IOS, Cake Wallet has expanded to include android applications and support for bitcoin, litecoin, ether and Cardano’s ADA. The wallet maintains some of the fundamental features of traditional wallets such as a built-in exchange and support for “fiat view.”      Rather than use a 32-bit ambiguous string (on the visible layer at least), Cake Wallet’s 150,000 users will be able to create usernames under the [NAME].crypto format.      The domains are minted by the popular blockchain domain provider Unstoppable Domains. Their process involves creating a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain that is attached to the actual domain. This way, each domain is unique and unreplicable.    Read more: ENS Is Minting NFTs of 23 Top Level Domains. Here’s What That Means  Retaining privacy    Initially launched as Bitmonero, a fork of Bytecoin, Monero has grown to a $4.8 billion market cap. Unlike Bitcoin, Monero has built-in privacy features that protect new users’ privacy by default.    Read more: Bug Found in Decoy Algorithm for Privacy Coin Monero    According to Unstoppable Domains, while using these domain usernames in Cake Wallet, the privacy of Monero is still retained. The domain is connected to the main Monero address (Bitcoin/Litecoin/Ethereum address) that is used when sending and receiving funds.      However, in Monero, unique stealth addresses are published on the blockchain, not the main/sub addresses.      “There's no way to go from a stealth address to a main/sub address without the private view key,” explained Justin Ehrenhofer, creator of the Breaking Monero series.      Brad Kam, co-founder of Unstoppable Domains, said, “You can attach a static Monero address to your domain and receive money to it without having your balances exposed. Transactions associated with a particular wallet address remain 100% private. It’s the best of both worlds: public usernames, private transactions.”      He also mentioned that the system is completely opt-in and that users don’t need to create a username for their wallets.      “Cake Wallet and Unstoppable Domains share a similar goal to make it easier for people to send and receive their crypto safely and seamlessly,” said Vik Sharma, CEO of Cake Wallet. “Through this integration our users benefit from being able to transfer crypto between 50+ wallets and exchanges, all with one blockchain-based username.”",POSITIVE,ADA | ENS,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | XMR | ENS,Myles Sherman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/11/cake-wallet-brings-readable-usernames-to-its-crypto-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62d542a2228a6f0a219d91e3f42166f0b5f7cb5e-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 4.3% year-over-year, lowerthan economists’ expectation of 4.4%.      Prices rising while interest rates remain low could lead more investors to pour into bitcoin over bonds as a reward for paying those higher prices. Bitcoin traders closely track headline inflation numbers in the event that the premiere digital asset becomes a hedge against inflation because of its limited supply cap.      The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the increase, which compares July 2021 prices to those from July 2020 and shows an economy that’s working through supply constraints while trying to meet increasing demand. On a month-to-month basis, which takes out how much prices dipped in 2020, consumer prices rose 0.5%      The July CPI report may not influence tapering discussions at the Federal Reserve. In last month’s Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the central bank is aiming to make gains in its goal to reach maximum employment before tapering. (The Fed’s quantitative easing program brings more liquidity to the markets through quantitative easing that gives investors the liquidity to invest more in riskier assets like bitcoin.)      The rest of the report was illustrative of easing bottlenecks in the global supply chain. On a month-over-month basis:    Used vehicle prices rose by 0.2%, slowing June’s trend of high demand for used automobiles in lieu of new ones, when prices for used autos increased by 10.5%.  Airline fares fell slightly by 0.1%,compared to June’s 2.7%.  The food index increased by 0.7%, compared to June’s 0.8%.

Just kidding … Or am I?      In all seriousness, this code change has been more than two years in the making. So far, it appears to be effective at doing two things, including burning ether and curbing block sizes to an ideal target. It hasn’t been so effective in helping users predict what transaction fees will look like over a few minutes or hours, but it has removed the uncertainty for users trying to price their transactions in the heat of the moment.      In today’s New Frontiers, I do a deep dive on how EIP 1559 is affecting miners on the Ethereum blockchain and the main factors contributing to why the effect on their revenue has been minor so far. (Ha, no pun intended.)      This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.    Pulse check    The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week.    Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.    New frontiers: Ethereum miner revenues hold up    Bullish ether (ETH) prices and surges in non-fungible token (NFT) trading activity have made up for miner revenue lost as a result of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559.    Bullish ether prices    EIP 1559 was activated alongside four other EIPs bundled into the London upgrade last Thursday. As a result of its activation, the bulk of transaction fees normally awarded to miners are instead being burned and removed from circulation.      A total of 22,708 ETH worth roughly $71.6 million has been burnt since the London upgrade, representing roughly 33% of new coin supply growth.      Reduced revenue from transaction fees does not appear to have significantly affected total miner revenue on Ethereum. Data from Coin Metrics shows that in the days following EIP 1559 activation, daily miner revenue in USD has increased 7.1% and remains at two-month highs.      Part of the reason for persistently high miner revenue levels is the bullish price breakout for ETH, which took off in earnest a day prior to London. Anand Gomes, co-founder of crypto trading platform Paradigm, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat, “London … is driving this activity [and] it’s mostly institutional.”      To Gomes’ point, the ETH options market has seen ultra-bullish flows as of late, with Paradigm seeing a bull call spread at $40,000 and $50,000 strike prices expiring in March 2022.      Despite their lower earnings in native ETH units from transaction fees, miners are recouping lost rewards from higher ETH prices.    Surges in NFT trading activity on Ethereum    Beyond price activity, the number of on-chain transactions transferring NFTs have increased 75% over the last seven days, which has also boosted miner revenue. The biggest NFT release in recent days has been the CovidPunks series, which was dropped on the same day as London and sold out within minutes.      Over the past seven days, CovidPunks has reached a total sales volume of over $1.24 million. Several users reported failed transactions because of insufficient transaction fees, which noticeably spiked from under 100 gwei – gwei is one billionth of an ETH – to over 400 gwei the first hour these NFTs started trading.      Under EIP 1559, miners can still be rewarded for including transactions into a block through an optional tip known as the “priority fee.” Users have paid a total of 7,141 ETH, worth roughly $22.4 million at time of writing, in priority fees since the activation of the London upgrade.      Because miners still get rewarded for a portion of transaction fees on Ethereum, a spike in on-chain activity due to an NFT drop or a popular decentralized finance (DeFi) application will boost total miner revenue through increased priority fees.    Most transactions are not formatted for EIP 1559    As reported on Friday, the vast majority of transactions aren't formatted for EIP 1559, meaning users aren't specifying a minimum base fee or priority fee. In these instances, the fee attached to legacy transactions on Ethereum is automatically split to cover the cost for the base fee, which is burnt, and then the priority fee, which is awarded to miners.      The benefit for users and network service providers who do optimize for EIP 1559 is that any portion of their transaction fee that is not used to cover the base fee or the amount they have specified for the priority fee will be refunded back to the sender’s account. Given that EIP 1559-formatted transactions are generally cheaper for users than legacy Ethereum transactions are, it is likely only a matter of time before more applications and service providers adopt the new format. The delay in adoption, however, is a sign of wariness from users and businesses that are giving EIP 1559 time to stabilize and prove its effectiveness on the network.    Validated takes  The first backward-incompatible upgrade, or hard fork, for the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain has been scheduled for activation on a test network later this month. BACKGROUND: Dubbed “Altair,” the upgrade will be released on the Prymont testnet at epoch 6150, expected to hit on Aug. 19. All users who connect to Prymont will need to upgrade their computers, or nodes, in time for Altair activation. However, popular Eth 2.0 software clients such as Prysmatic Labs and Lighthouse have yet to release a software version compatible with the Prymont Altair upgrade.  For the first time ever, NFT marketplace OpenSea has topped the leaderboard in gas consumption on Ethereum, overtaking decentralized exchange Uniswap, which had previously ranked number one since December. BACKGROUND: The resurgence of NFT trading activity from highs earlier this year is evidence of the persisting interest and growth in this sector. Data site Glassnode projects that OpenSea will reach $1 billion in volume by the end of the month and have 300,000 active users.  The U.S. Senate did not adopt a bipartisan compromise on a crypto tax provision in its $1 trillion infrastructure bill after a vote on Monday. BACKGROUND: The proposed amendment announced by U.S. Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and supported by Democrats, Republicans and the Treasury Department would have exempted protocol developers and transaction validators from the purview of this bill. The amendment, which needed unanimous consent, was objected to by Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.).  In the first case of its kind, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform for selling unregistered securities. BACKGROUND: The founders of the platform called “DeFi Money Market” were charged for unregistered sales of more than $30 million of securities in the form of governance tokens that allegedly had no role in the core business of the platform. Without admitting to or denying the findings in the SEC’s order, the founders consented to a cease-and-desist order that includes disgorgement totaling $12.8 million and penalties of $250,000.  Ether’s trading volume totaled $1.4 trillion in the first six months of 2021, growing three times faster than bitcoin’s trading volume. BACKGROUND: According to crypto exchange Coinbase’s biannual review, ether outshone bitcoin, the S&P 500 and gold in terms of price performance, rallying 210% from January to the end of June. The report cited the growth of Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFI) ecosystem, upcoming transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) and the EIP 1559 upgrade as reasons for ether’s impressive market performance so far this year.  Blockchain interoperability protocol Wormhole launched its 2.0 release on mainnet this week. BACKGROUND: Wormhole enables transfers of non-native assets between several blockchains including Solana, Ethereum, Terra and Binance Smart Chain. Said to be the “trustless bridge” for easy transfers of tokens to Solana from other decentralized networks, Wormhole is secured by 19 validators.

The terms also state that the copyright of digital works belongs to the creator or issuer and that buyers can't use them for commercial purposes without consent.  The mini-program caters primarily to fans who want to buy NFTs of celebrity memorabilia.  The NFT market globally has been picking up, with marketplaces hitting all-time records in transaction volumes.

42397054,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYZsr,1628679600,Gensler Tells Elizabeth Warren SEC Needs More Authority to Regulate Crypto,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler wants his agency to have greater authority and resources to crack down on the crypto sector.      In a letter to U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Gensler said Congress should grant the agency with additional oversight and enforcement abilities to monitor “transactions, products and platforms” in the U.S. crypto sector.      “In my view, the legislative priority should center on crypto trading, lending and DeFi (decentralized finance) platforms. Regulators would benefit from additional plenary authority to write rules for and attach guardrails to crypto trading and lending,” he said.      Gensler’s letter, shared publicly on Wednesday, is a response to an open letter published by Warren last month, when the Massachusetts Democrat asked what authority the SEC has in regulating crypto exchanges and whether there are any gaps.      Warren pointed to how cryptocurrency exchanges serve as custodians for customer funds, saying that the “the lack of regulation to provide basic investor protections is unsustainable.”      “Right now, I believe investors using these platforms are not adequately protected,” Gensler said in his letter.    Stable value tokens    Gensler reiterated previous remarks he’s made about stablecoins in his response.      The SEC chairman, who previously ran the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) from 2009 to 2014, said stablecoin users may be trying – if not outright able – to evade anti-money laundering, tax, sanctions and other regulations.      “There is an existing stablecoin market worth $113 billion, including four large stablecoins – some of which have been around for seven years,” he said. “These stablecoins are embedded in crypto trading and lending platforms. To trade crypto-to-crypto, usually, somebody uses stablecoins. In July, nearly three-quarters of trading on all crypto trading platforms occurred between a stablecoin and some other token.”      Gensler has previously warned that stablecoins might fall under securities regulations if they are themselves backed by securities.      In a statement on Wednesday referring to crypto as the “Wild West of our financial system,” Warren said the industry needs better regulation to protect both the financial system and investors.      “I’m glad SEC Chair Gensler agrees and has directed the SEC to use its full authority to address these risks, and that he has also identified where additional regulatory authority may need to be granted by Congress,” Warren said. “I’m going to continue to engage with the SEC and other federal regulators on this, and will work to close regulatory gaps through legislation.”      It’s unclear whether Warren intends to introduce legislation calling for new regulations to address Gensler’s concerns or whether other federal agencies or private companies will also be solicited for their views on the issue.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/11/gensler-tells-elizabeth-warren-sec-needs-more-authority-to-regulate-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e019381dc132d898bbb3ee9ddac2a97ff12d333c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The hacker's Polygon address sent $10,000 in USDC to a wallet set up by Poly Network at 8:46 UTC on Wednesday, before sending another $1 million 15 minutes later, PolygonScan, a tool that enables searches for transactions on the Polygon blockchain, shows.  The Poly Network is a computer network that allows users to transfer digital tokens from blockchain to another one.  The hacker also returned $1.1 million in BTCB on Binance Smart Chain at 9:49 UTC.  On the Ethereum blockchain, the hacker returned $622,000 in fei at 10:54 UTC and a little over $2 million in shiba inu five minutes later.  When Poly Network announced the hack and the associated wallet addresses, the accounts held over $600 million in various cryptocurrencies. Less than $400 million remained by the time the hacker said he was ready to return the funds.  Before starting the return, the hacker embedded a message in a transaction with himself: ""ACCEPT DONATIONS TO ""THE HIDDEN SIGNER"" NOW. ENCRYPT YOUR MSG WITH HIS PUBKEY.""  The hacker has been embedding messages to transactions with his own addresses to communicate with the world. Dozens of people have used the same method to ask for handouts.  Earlier Wednesday, the hacker used the same approach to say he was ready to return the funds. He then said he was unable to get in touch with Poly Network and asked for multisignature wallets.  Poly Network, which had been calling for the funds' return, prepared wallets on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, the three blockchains the hacker has been using.  O3 Labs, a Tokyo-based blockchain developer associated with Poly Network's affiliate Neo, said the hacker might be a so-called ""white-hat"" hacker. Returning the funds indicates the hacker wasn't after his own gain, like a so-called ""black-hat"" hacker, but wanted to expose vulnerabilities to make the project more robust.  The attack took advantage of a bug within Poly Network's cross-chain smart contract, security company SlowMist said.    UPDATE (AUG 11, 10:24 UTC): Adds details about the hacker's behavior.

Prices are currently at about $46,350 after topping out at $46,453 in the last 24 hours, CoinDesk data show. The crypto is up 57% year to date and is making headway toward its all-time high of $64,829 on April 14.

Data from Glassnode shows the total supply of bitcoin held by entities with a balance of 0.1-1 BTC has continued to increase alongside bitcoin's price, suggesting that retail investors are buying alongside institutional investors.      Bitcoin isn't the only crypto that is experiencing an uptick in trading activity in August.      ""Ether and other assets are representing the majority in trading volume and not bitcoin,"" said Daniel Kim, head of capital markets at Maple Finance. ""This shows that individuals and institutions are feeling a lot more comfortable holding other cryptos and are no longer diversifying their portfolios by just holding bitcoin.""      Other notable altcoins in the top 20 by market capitalization are also riding high over a 24-hour period as cardano, XRP, binance coin, polygon and stellar have all posted gains.

At about 4:00 UTC on Wednesday, the hacker said in a message embedded in a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain with himself that he was ready to return the funds. In another message, the hacker said he had failed to contact Poly Network and asked for a multisignature wallet to return the loot.  The hacker's Polygon address sent $10,000 in USDC to one of the wallets Poly Network set up at 8:46 UTC.  The hacker said he was already a ""legend"" after pulling off what some, including China-based Poly Network, have described as the largest hack ever of a decentralized finance (DeFi) network.  Poly Network announced the heist on Tuesday evening on Twitter and posted three addresses on Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, and Polygon where the funds were funneled. At the time, the accounts held more than $600 million in tokens, including USDC, shiba inu, wrapped ether, and wrapped bitcoin.  At the time of writing, the three addresses hold just under $400 million after sending money to other addresses, including DeFi liquidity pool Ellipsis Finance.  Poly Network has endorsed the analysis of security company SlowMist, which blames the cyberattack on a bug related to the protocol's cross-chain functions. Chinese company BlockSec has stated it's possible the hack resulted from a leaked private key.

It isn't the first time the research firm has criticized Coinbase's value. In May, New Constructs predicted that the exchange's share price would fall to $100. Coinbase's share price did fall to an all-time low of $208 on May 19, but has managed to claw back losses and is currently trading at about $269.      Still, amid the backdrop of regulatory developments and U.S. politicians wanting their slice of the ""crypto trading pie"" in the form of taxes, Trainer argues Coinbase investors should be wary.      ""At current levels, Coinbase's stock remains terribly overvalued,"" said Trainer, who points to a need for Coinbase to attain higher revenue than established rivals like Nasdaq (NDAQ) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).      Trainer also points to Coinbase's dependency on the spot price of bitcoin for its transaction revenue growth, noting that as bitcoin prices move up or down, so too does the exchange's share price.      Indeed, as a result of bitcoin's shaky performance so far in the second half of the year, the exchange has warned that the number of users conducting transactions and trading volume will be lower in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter.      ""Hints of lower volumes in Q3 coupled with July’s crypto market volatility has led to a mild retracement to the US$270 level,"" Toby Chapple, head of trading at digital asset firm Zerocap, told CoinDesk via Telegram.      Yet despite its lower expectations for the third quarter, the digital asset firm said Coinbase is diversifying into other cryptos, which is helping it capture market share.      ""Ultimately we expect a buoyant share price into the rest of this month given the supply shifts in Ethereum, and expected sentiment growth from traders and investors,"" Chapple said.      The second quarter was Coinbase's first full quarter as a public company. It listed its shares on Nasdaq in April.

And why would that country ban an industry that made them the ultimate leaders in the most important development in recent times? The world is still scratching its head. There has to be something else to this story. Is it only control that they want? Or does China have a secret plan nobody&apos;s been able to figure out? We at NewsBTC have been studying the case, looking for clues, reporting on related news. After the ban, when Bitcoin&apos;s hash rate collapsed, we posed Bitcoin Magazine&apos;s Lucas Nuzzi&apos;s theory that it all had to do with the Digital Yuan, China&apos;s CBDC. Then, we found out Chinese entrepreneurs are selling small hydropower stations and wondered if decommissioning them was part of their plan. After that, the shocking reveal that China&apos;s dominance over Bitcoin mining was already waning before the ban raised more questions than answers. The fine people at Bloomberg might&apos;ve found new clues by tackling a related but different question. In the article titled &apos;The China Model: What the Country&apos;s Tech Crackdown Is Really About,&apos; they pose a theory about the reasons behind their attack on Alibaba and DiDi. Two of China&apos;s giant unicorn tech companies, also world leaders in their respective fields.
