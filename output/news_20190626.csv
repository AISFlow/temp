Wright lawsuit.  Bitcoin’s alleged creator called upon two expert witnesses, a fact witness, and himself to testify at the federal evidentiary hearing, which will begin at 9 a.m. This can potentially lead to Wright’s cross-examination.  Wright already faces the possibility of being placed in contempt of court at either the civil or criminal level for failing to disclose a full list of his bitcoin holdings gained prior to Dec. 31, 2013, per a court order, according to the plaintiff's representation.  The nChain chief scientist allegedly mined a hoard of more than 1.1 million bitcoins with Dave Kleiman between 2009 and 2011, which are said to be stored in the “Tulip Trust.” Ira Kleiman is suing on behalf of his brother’s estate for half of the fair market value of those coins, as well as rights to his brother’s intellectual property.  According to the court document, Brett Roberson, Director AlixPartners in Dallas, Texas, will provide sworn testimony regarding digital forensics and PGP signatures. Roberson’s range of experience also covers detection of intellectual property theft, analysis of a computer user's actions over specific time periods, and recovery of deleted files, according to his CV, attached to the filing as Exhibit 1.  Wright previously said the Tulip Trust is inaccessible due to a cryptographic scheme called Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm.  The second expert witness, Kevin Madure, former IBM consultant and VP of cybersecurity at AlixPartners, will testify to cryptography, cryptocurrencies and blockchain as it pertains to this case.  Steve Shadders, CTO of nChain, will testify as a fact witness. Shadders previously published a blog post titled “On the Satoshiness of Dr Craig S Wright,” where he argued that Wright is probably Satoshi Nakamoto. He writes based on his experience working with Wright, although he allegedly turned down the opportunity to view conclusive evidence:  “I have seen so much evidence that #craigissatoshi that it is a no brainer to me. It is not something I believe it is something I know as an iron-clad and indisputable fact. So much so that when I was offered the opportunity to see a private cryptographic proof, without even thinking I said ""No, I don't need to see it"" and the conversation ended there.”  “Not to be outdone,” said Palley, a lawyer who follows the case but is uninvolved, Wright has also called himself as a factual witness.

CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index is currently trading at 13,020, the highest level seen since mid-January 2018, having surpassed the Asian session high of $12,919 at roughly 17:30 UTC.  With the rise above $13,000, bitcoin has taken the cumulative month-to-date gains to 50 percent and the cryptocurrency now looks set to log double-digit gains for the third straight month. Further, BTC is on track to end higher for the fifth straight month – the longest monthly winning streak since April-June 2017.  Also, the double-digit price gain seen in the last 24 hours is accompanied by a record $33 billion trading volume across cryptocurrency exchanges, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  Bitcoin’s recent rise looks sustainable with the dominance rate hovering at 18-month highs above 61.5%. The dominance rate is an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency.  A price rise accompanied by a surge in the dominance rate indicates the money is being poured into the bitcoin market for a long haul and not merely to fund purchases of cheap alternative cryptocurrencies.  That is also evident from the sharp losses in altcoins’ BTC-denominated exchange rates. For instance, names like XRP, bitcoin cash, EOS, binance coin and other major altcoins are currently down 10-33 percent on a seven-day basis.  Litecoin, which is scheduled to undergo mining reward halving in August, is also down 27 percent on a weekly basis.

Coinsource will be updating all of its 230 machines in 29 US states and the District of Columbia to allow customers to buy, sell, and store Dai stablecoins.  Phase two of the rollout will launch a remittance service allowing crypto ATM and Dai users to send cash from wallet to wallet, enabling recipients to instantly redeem funds at any Coinsource machine or supported location.  Like Facebook’s Libra, Coinsource is hoping to extend financial services to an underserved and unbanked population.  “By offering support for Dai, we can provide the benefits of crypto to customers who are without access to bank accounts, while at the same time allowing them to avoid the price volatility typically associated with today’s often fluctuating crypto markets,” said Sheffield Clark, CEO of Coinsource, in a statement.  MakerDAO limits the effects of market volatility through a 1:1 soft peg to the U.S. dollar, maintained with an underlying basket of crypto assets, Collateralized Debt Positions, and automated stability mechanisms.  Additionally, MakerDAO lets users lock up ethereum as collateral via a smart contract in exchange for Dai. Roughly 2 percent – equivalent to over $340 million – of all ethereum is locked in DAO’s decentralized finance application.

42403035,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeIQS,1561563929,"Buried in Facebook's Libra White Paper, a Digital Identity Bombshell","The Takeaway  Facebook's Libra white paper includes a brief but potentially seismic nod to digital identity standards.  With 2 billion users worldwide, Facebook may be able to succeed where others have failed in jump-starting a globally accepted digital ID.  Some identity experts say this is even more important than the cryptocurrency, but others question how much control Libra would give users and find its approach overbearing.      Buried in Facebook’s Libra white paper are two short sentences hinting that the project's ambitions go even further than bringing billions of people into the global financial system.  More than launching a price-stable cryptocurrency for the masses, Libra could be aiming to change the way people trust each other on the internet.  At the top of page nine, in a section describing the consortium that will govern the Libra coin, the white paper states:  “An additional goal of the association is to develop and promote an open identity standard. We believe that decentralized and portable digital identity is a prerequisite to financial inclusion and competition.”  That’s all the paper has to say on the topic of identity, perhaps explaining why the brief mention of such a foundational issue for 21st-century commerce escaped widespread notice despite all the hype over the document itself.  But to some observers, the line dropped like a bomb.  Dave Birch, director of Consult Hyperion and the author of books on digital identity and bitcoin, flagged these lines as “the most interesting” in the paper.  Smoothing pathways on the internet using identity is a bigger deal to many people than a putative cryptocurrency, Birch argued, adding:  “There are no throwaway remarks in a Facebook white paper that has taken a year to put together. It's in there for a reason. [Facebook] are actually going to try and fix the identity problem.”  A Facebook spokeswoman said this week that the company had nothing to add about identity beyond what's in the white paper.  Who are you?  It’s a problem almost as old as the internet itself. As the classic ""New Yorker"" cartoon put it, ""on the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.""  In such an environment, businesses need to guard against fraud, but the copious amounts of personal data consumers must share to prove they are who they say they are leaves them vulnerable to identity theft and spying.  Fixing this problem means finding a way to have the sort of credentials an individual holds in their physical wallet realized in a verifiable digital version which can be trusted across the internet. And for many technologists who have thought long and hard about identity, the solution must be ""self-sovereign,"" or controlled by the individual.  Birch, who has long seen the potential of social networks as natural springboards for managing digital identity, described a scenario where a user’s “I am over 18” credential (rather than their exact birthdate) is needed to log into a dating site.  This could be accessed through Libra’s cryptocurrency wallet Calibra via one of its partners, Mastercard, for example, with its two-factor authentication process. Then a cryptographic credential is sent back to Calibra containing no personally identifiable information but stating this person is over 18, which can then be presented to the dating site at log in.  While others have proposed similar arrangements (sometimes involving blockchains), none had the reach of Facebook, with its 2.38 billion users worldwide.  If Libra were “to drift in the direction of self-sovereign solutions, Facebook's endorsement of that approach might make more of an impact on the market than, say, uPort or Evernym might have done,"" Birch said, referring to two such blockchain ID startups.  And despite its reputation as the ultimate Peeping Tom, Facebook has hinted at such aspirations before. In February, while Libra was still under wraps, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was investigating blockchain's potential to allow internet users to log in to various services via one set of credentials without relying on third parties.  Standard setting  Stepping back, technologists have been trying to address the challenge of identity for more than a decade by establishing open standards. In the same way that URLs, for example, open webpages anywhere on the internet, standards are also needed to ensure digital attributes about an individual can be universally issued and verified.  The OAuth standard, for example, is what let you log into websites through a third-party service like Facebook without sharing a password. More recently, such work under the auspices of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has included things like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and the verifiable credentials standard, both meant to enable self-sovereign digital identity.  Some veterans of this field were taken aback by the suggestion that the Libra Association (a group of 30 or so companies, expected to reach 100 or more) would develop an open identity standard.  “That's very world domination-ish of them,” said Kaliya Young, a co-author of ""A Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity"" and co-founder of the Internet Identity Workshop. “Some of us have been working on that problem for a really long time. You already have a set of open standards for verifiable credentials that are basically done and working.”  Young pointed out that “unilaterally declaring” an open standard belies the process of going through standards development with an open community, adding that all the people working on identity standards are connected to one another in reaching a common goal.  “That work is being led by a community of people deeply committed to there being no one company owning it in the end, because identity is too big to be owned, just like the web is too big to be owned,” she said.  (Indeed, Facebook was previously said to have rebuffed an invitation to participate in the DID project alongside Microsoft.)  Phil Windley, chair at the Sovrin Foundation, which contributed the codebase to the Hyperledger Indy blockchain ID project, acknowledged the risk of parsing two sentences in Libra’s paper too finely. But he made the point that “decentralized” and “portable” (Facebook's words) are not exactly the same as self-sovereign.  ""Decentralized"" could simply mean a user’s identity data – their attributes and identifiers – are spread among nodes that are run on the Libra blockchain, said Windley. This doesn’t imply the user necessarily has control of them. Likewise, ""portable"" just means credentials can be moved from one place to another but doesn't necessarily mean you get a say in how they are used.  Windley told CoinDesk:  ""People often use 'decentralized' as an unalloyed gilt and just assume that it means everything is going to be great. That could be what they are doing here – just using 'decentralized' as a synonym for ‘awesome.’""  Joining the dots  That said, Windley was respectful about the scale of Libra’s vision, which he suspects is much bigger than dealing with know-your-customer (KYC) checks and the regulation around building a global permissioned currency platform.  He pointed to the paper’s authors which include many firms like Mastercard or Kiva, folks who have thought very hard about digital identity. (Neither company would comment on Libra’s approach to digital identity).  “I suspect given Libra's goal of financial inclusion, they are probably thinking about it bigger than just authentication and authorization for a few narrow purposes,” said Windley. “I think there is enough there (e.g. the smart contract language) to believe a stablecoin is just one thing that they envisage using Libra for.”  In the absence of any detail on what might comprise a decentralized identity standard from Libra’s perspective, some dots can be joined by examining the recent work of George Danezis and his co-founders at Chainspace, a startup acquired by Facebook in May.  A paper introducing a “selective disclosure credential scheme” called Coconut explains how a system of smart contracts (computer programs that run on top of blockchains) could “issue user credentials depending on the state of the blockchain, or attest some claim about a user operating through the contract – such as their identity, attributes, or even the balance of their wallet.”  The Coconut protocol goes on to describe how credentials can be jointly issued in a decentralized manner by a group of “mutually distrusting authorities."" These credentials cannot be forged by users or a group of corrupt authorities, and are also “re-randomized” prior to being presented for verification to further protect user privacy. Unlike some computationally-hungry proving schemes, this is done in a matter of a few milliseconds making it highly scalable.  Returning to the question of standards, Birch said W3C, DIDs and verified credentials might be the right option for Libra, but whether it’s that or something else, basically whatever they choose would end up being a standard, he said, concluding:  “And you could argue, is that necessarily a bad thing? I mean what happens if they come up with a good standard for identity and attributes and so on and then other people can use it, e.g. banks would be one obvious example.”  Mark Zuckerberg image via Facebook",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/26/buried-in-facebooks-libra-white-paper-a-digital-identity-bombshell,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5bda3ef61468c45b315f20ab7b4557164d5f7b4-1500x948.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In addition to the funding, Imgur has agreed to build Coil into its platform, which receives 300 million monthly users, to provide micropayments to users who view content, according to a report from TechCrunch.  The partnership will also be marked by a forthcoming premium Imgur membership with exclusive features and content for Coil subscribers. A $5 per month Coil subscription funds creators per second that the subscriber spends consuming their content at a rate of 36 cents per hour.  “Imgur began in 2009 as a gift to the internet. Over the last 10 years we’ve built one of the largest, most positive online communities, based on our core value to ‘give more than we take’” Alan Schaaf, founder and CEO of Imgur, said in a press statement. ""Coil's technology will open up new opportunities for users to give to one another and support the community in new ways.""  Coil was founded last year by Stefan Thomas, the former chief technology officer of Ripple Labs, as a means to pay creators for their labor. It’s subscription service is now in open beta, and it provides extensions for Chrome and Firefox.  Comparable to Spotify, Coil’s Web Monetization API automatically pays creators in XRP based on usage, while the user enjoys the flat subscription fee.  Thomas will join Imgur’s board. Imgur previously received $40 million Series A from Andreessen Horowitz and Reddit.  Coil’s investment stems from Ripple Labs’ Xpring Initiative, which aims to fund proliferation of the Ripple XRP ecosystem. Imgur received US dollars in the funding deal.

In a move that marks its first ever acquisition, CoinMarketCap said in press release Wednesday that it is purchasing Hashtag Capital, a startup developing algorithms that analyse ""all points of available liquidity"" in order to more accurately reflect an asset.  Hashtag had originally been an absolute returns crypto trading fund, and began working on ways to create better quality markets data as part of its fund management. This project was what attracted CoinMarketCap to the company, according to the release. The Hashtag team will be joining CoinMarketCap once the acquisition is complete.  The news comes after CoinMarketCap launched a transparency initiative with a number of cryptocurrency exchanges on May 1. The effort saw the firms forming a new group, dubbed the Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance (DATA), to discuss ways to tackle concerns over cryptocurrency data reporting.  CoinMarketCap at the same time mandated that all exchanges listed on its platform must provide live trading and orderbook data or be removed from the platform’s adjusted volume calculations.  Cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management has previously claimed that 95 percent of all reported bitcoin trading volume is faked and that the true spot market for bitcoin essentially exists on just 10 different exchanges.  “We are excited to push the envelope on cryptocurrency pricing at CoinMarketCap, going beyond our traditional volume-weighted average prices to even more sophisticated price algorithms and analyses,” said Brandon Chez, CEO and founder of CoinMarketCap. “The Hashtag Capital team will be able to add significantly to our data efforts, and drive the next phase of CoinMarketCap in providing data products to the market.”  In other CoinMarketCap news, the data provider has also made changes to its executive team, promoting Carylyne Chan from global head of marketing to chief strategy officer, while Emily Hurd advances from head of business development to chief revenue officer.

42382215,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtnP,1561554039,"Multicoin, Intel Capital Invest $3.5 Million in Startup Demystifying Blockchain Data","Blockchain data startup dfuse has just closed its first official round of equity funding.  Led by Multicoin Capital and Intel Capital (a division of Intel Corporation), the seed funding saw the Montreal-based firm raise $3.5 million for its line of products geared towards demystifying blockchain data.  According to a press release provided to CoinDesk on Wednesday, other notable backers of the round included the VC funds Diagram Ventures, BoxOne Ventures, Panache Ventures and White Star Capital.  Founded in 2018, dfuse builds application programming interfaces (APIs) that overlay smart-contract-enabled blockchain platforms such as ethereum and EOS. These APIs help simplify the complexities of pulling data directly from a public blockchain.  Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, told CoinDesk in an email:  ""Blockchain databases can take seconds to confirm transactions – if they even confirm them at all. They don’t offer global search, reading data is non-trivial, and streaming updates is mostly out of the question. dfuse abstracts all of that complexity away.""  At present, the startup has four flagship products: dfuse Stream, Lifecycle, Search and On Demand Networks. Leveraging these tools, users can stream real-time transaction activity, search through blockchain databases, receive transaction guarantees for newly submitted data and more.  “Our vision is to help millions of developers embrace blockchain technology in their businesses,"" dfuse CEO and co-founder Marc-Antoine Ross told CoinDesk. ""Depending on which numbers you look at, there's 20 to 40 million developers around the globe. We think only 1 percent of that developer population is touching any blockchain. We really want to fast track this.""  Moving forward, Ross intends to expand dfuse API products “to blanket all of the top blockchain platforms,” not just EOS and ethereum.  What’s more, he detailed that the company will in coming weeks release a data integrity bounty program in partnership with security firm HackerOne to help assure users the data they are reading via dfuse products is accurate.  ""Many companies have built security bounty programs but this is about data integrity,"" Ross said. ""This is something we will be campaigning to increase the trust in our APIs and we will challenge the other players in the community to do the same thing.""

42382209,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qth7,1561554034,Chainalysis Hires FinCEN Vet to Tackle Crypto's New 'Travel Rule' Challenge,"The blockchain investigations firm Chainalysis has hired a top official from the main U.S. anti-money-laundering agency to help its cryptocurrency clients comply with tough new international data-sharing requirements.  Announced Wednesday, Mike Mosier, the former chief of strategic advancement and tactical development at the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), has joined Chainalysis as chief technical counsel.  Mosier has spent a decade in various financial regulatory bodies: before FinCEN, he worked at the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the National Security Council and the Department of Justice’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section.  Leveraging his experience in financial crime prevention, Mosier will first and foremost tackle legal and technical solutions for the ""travel rule"" that is now being imposed on the crypto industry by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  Under that standard, finalized last week, FATF's member countries will require crypto exchanges and wallet providers to identify both the sender and recipient of funds and pass this information to each other along with each transfer.  While this is a longstanding requirement for banks when they transmit money on customers' behalf, it presents a daunting challenge for the crypto industry given the pseudonymous nature of wallet addresses.  Chainalysis itself had warned during the public consultation period that this requirement would force ""onerous investment and friction"" onto regulated firms, potentially putting some out of business and driving activity into the shadows.  Speaking to the need to balance the benefits and risks of crypto, Mosier told CoinDesk:  ""There is a really important moment: there is this censorship resistant and financially inclusive industry that also was involved in the Dark Web and election intervention.""  The challenge ahead  Chainalysis will keep engaging with the blockchain community, as it has been for a while now, to work out technical solutions for implementing the travel rule, Mosier said. No particular technology has been agreed upon so far, he said.  ""There have been a few ideas, but I think it’s a bit too early to see something that will work,"" he said, adding that looking at how banks struggled to implement the original travel rule and how they solved that issue might be helpful.  While stressing that it is ""technology-neutral,"" the FATF guidance released Friday did offer several examples of existing technologies that the industry might consider to help identify recipients of crypto transfers and transmit this data.  These include public and private keys, Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) connections, X.509 certificates and APIs, the FATF said.  The other issues on Mosier's plate will be data privacy and product development, he said.  He will be also making sure that Chainalysis' solutions for blockchain transaction monitoring (its namesake offering) will be compatible with regulations in jurisdictions other than the U.S. where the company also has clients, Mosier said.  Building a team  Talking about his motivation to join the blockchain industry, Mosier said that working in financial crime prevention he has been looking at new areas of financial monitoring.  ""As I was moving more and more towards innovation at FinCEN, Chainalysis had a really sweet spot for me,"" he said. ""They focus on maintaining financial integrity but also privacy, to understand what the risks are but not getting into the personal data, making sure that the industry is growing, but not on the risk side.""  Mosier is joining Chainalysis’ Washington D.C., office soon after Jesse Spiro, who recently came from Refinitiv, a provider of finance risk management solutions owned by Blackstone Group and Thomson Reuters, and Kristofer Doucette, Chainalysis’ vice president of government affairs, who worked 14 years at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  The company is also looking to fill a new position of a federal account executive, who will ""engage with defense, intelligence, law enforcement, and state/local entities"" to help them investigate illicit cryptocurrency activity, the recent job posting by Chainalys says.  Getting experienced government alumni on board is especially helpful when regulators are paying such close attention to the crypto space, Chainalysis CEO and co-founder Michael Gronager said in the company’s announcement.  ""As we anticipate major global regulatory developments over the coming months, the strength of our team will ensure all our customers are fully equipped with the technology and the information they need to comply with regulation and combat money laundering in cryptocurrencies,"" said Gronager, whose company raised $30 million in a Series B round in February.  This new chapter for crypto, after the FATF ruling, will require a difficult balancing act between the speed and convenience of the technology on one side and adhering to regulations on the other, Moiser said, concluding:  ""It doesn’t have to be exactly like with SWIFT or traditional banking, but not that anything goes. I believe there is a middle ground for that.""

42382218,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtpv,1561554027,ConsenSys Spin-Out 3Box Raises $2.5 Million to Build ID Tools for Dapp Devs,"3Box, the latest startup to leave the Brooklyn-based incubator ConsenSys, just raised money to fuel a new identity tool for app developers.  3Box is developing a decentralized solution that people can use across both traditional and blockchain-based apps. The startup recently closed a $2.5 million seed round led by Placeholder Ventures, with investments from Venrock, CoinFund, Northzone and ConsenSys itself.  The ""3"" in 3Box is a subtle nod to the notion of Web3, a term used to describe the distributed evolution of digital platforms from social media sites to ticket sellers. Ethereum-centric startups such as MetaMask, Aragon and Foam – the latter of which garnered more than 500 contributors so far to its open source map – are already using 3Box. This pace of growth is what attracted the attention of CoinFund cofounder Jake Brukhman.  “This is a project with genuine traction,” Brukhman told CoinDesk. “There’s a huge hole in Web3 where identity should be. And I think 3Box is exactly where it should be to fill that hole.”  3Box aims to make portable logins and profiles more simple by utilizing the peer-to-peer InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to give users keys to their own data, which is distributed across nodes instead of storing the profile on a centralized server like Facebook or Twitter.  While 3Box currently runs all the nodes, the startup plans to make that open-source software easy for any developer to spin up in order to diversify the network.  “We’re building a decentralized storage network on top of IPFS that allows all these services to tap into it, but it’s governed by the users’ consent,” 3Box co-founder Michael Sena told CoinDesk. “You can use 3Box anywhere that you have an ethereum wallet, because you basically need to be able to sign a message with your key.”  3Box makes it easier for blockchain developers to include features like private chats, uploading photos, liking posts and other common activities related to user-generated content and social interaction that are currently absent from most decentralized applications (dapps).  Indeed, Foam CEO Ryan John King told CoinDesk that some of his users leverage 3Box to have their external Twitter handle, GitHub profile and Foam-related activity all built-in to their Foam profile for a “social and reputational layer.” In the future, King said Foam plans to integrate 3Box’s thread and chat features.  “It’s enhancing user experiences in a whole new way,” King said. “With 3Box there’s an open API, it allows people to opt-in and choose whatever information they want to include while interacting with the [FOAM] protocol.”  Sena added:  “We expect to see a whole new wave of more usable, more enjoyable, more engaging, distributed applications.”  Beyond Web3  According to Sena, 3Box plans to eventually enable a username and password option so that people could also use it for profiles on traditional apps.  Unlike a regular profile, where you can deactivate it but the company keeps your data, an app that supports 3Box could give users control over their profiles.  “The idea was to create a Google Drive or Dropbox-like interface that lets people manage their 3Box data,” Sena said. “Users can go on 3Box.io Hub, their drive, and just delete all of their data. And they can be sure that it’s gone.”  In terms of the startup’s business model, 3Box will focus on offering services, such as node management and unique features, to developers and web businesses.  “The benefits of minimizing risk and reducing liability, building lighter weight apps faster, those extend far beyond Web3 developers,” Sena said.  Speaking to 3Box’s broader business model, Brukhman concluded:  “There is inherent value in decentralizing identity and user data.”  3Box team in November 2018.

42382224,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtwD,1561546846,Bitcoin's Price Is Up 43% in 7 Days as Bull Frenzy Grips Market,"View  With bitcoin’s rise to 17-month highs, the Mayer multiple (a ratio of price to the 200-day moving average) is teasing a break above 2.40 – a level that has marked the beginning of speculative bubbles in the past.  BTC may see a short-lived spike to resistances at $17,230 (January 2018 high) and possibly to $20,000 (record high) if the Mayer multiple finds acceptance above 2.40.  The hourly chart is flashing signs of buyer exhaustion, however, so a correction to $11,000 cannot be ruled out.  A UTC close below the May 31 high of $9,097 would abort the bullish view.      Bitcoin’s (BTC) surging price over the last week is reminiscent of the bull market frenzy observed a year and a half ago.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose to a 17-month high of $12,936 on Bitstamp earlier today. At that price, the cryptocurrency was up $3,900 from the level of $9,036 seen a week ago.  Notably, with the near 90-degree rally to 17-month highs, the ratio of bitcoin’s price to the 200-day price average – known as Mayer multiple – printed a high of 2.42, a level which was last seen in early January 2018.  The Mayer multiple essentially quantifies the spread between the price and the 200-day MA. An above-1.0 ratio indicates BTC is in bull market territory above the 200-day MA, while a reading below one implies the cryptocurrency is in a bear market below the 200-day MA.  That said, over the years it has been observed that a reading above 2.4 signifies the beginning of a temporary speculative bubble – a self-feeding cycle of higher prices attracting more bids, leading to further rally.  Daily chart  The Mayer multiple rose above 2.4 on Mar. 4, 2013, when the price was trading at $36.00, representing 176 percent gains over lows near $13 seen in December 2012. More importantly, the cryptocurrency rallied more than 600 percent to $259 in the following four weeks before falling all the way back to $45 on April 12.  Further, prices rose from $11,000 to $20,000 in 16 days following the ratio’s rise above 2.4 percent on Dec. 1, 2018. Again, the bubble was short-lived, with prices falling to $12,000 on Dec. 22.  On similar lines, BTC had gone ballistic, rallying by more than 300 percent to $1,163 in three weeks following the Mayer multiple’s move above 2.40 on Nov. 7, 2013. By Dec. 18, however, the price was trading at lows near $350.  So, if history is a guide, then the fear of missing out may kick in once the Mayer multiple finds acceptance above 2.40, leading to further price rise toward the record high of $20,000.  As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $12,521, representing 10 percent gains on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, the Mayer multiple is seen at 2.40.  The cryptocurrency has pulled back from 17-month highs hit earlier today, leaving signs of bullish exhaustion on the short duration chart.  Hourly chart  Bitcoin created a doji candle with a long upper shadow earlier today. The doji candle – a sign of bull indecision or exhaustion – is backed by highest sell volume (marked by arrow) since June 6.  Such candles often mark a local top, according to Alex Kruger, a prominent fundamental and technical analyst.  As a result, a deeper pullback, possibly to the psychological support of $11,000 cannot be ruled out – more so, as a widely followed long-term indicator is reporting extreme overbought conditions.  Weekly RSI  The 14-week relative strength index (RSI) is currently hovering above 81.00, the highest level since mid-December 2017.  While the case for a minor pullback is looking strong, the overall outlook will remain bullish as long as the price is held above the May 31 high of $9,097 and the cryptocurrency could chart another meteoric rise toward $20,000 if the Mayer multiple rises above 2.40.

42382214,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtm9,1561540219,Mt Gox Founder Hit With Lawsuit Over Alleged Fraudulent Misrepresentation,"UPDATE: This article has been updated with comment from McCaleb      Jed McCaleb, the founder of Mt. Gox, faces a lawsuit over his handling of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange.  The two plaintiffs, former Mt. Gox traders Joseph Jones and Peter Steinmetz, filed a complaint with a court in California on May 19, accusing McCaleb of ""fraudulent"" and ""negligent"" misrepresentation of the exchange, which partially led to their loss of bitcoin when Mt. Gox suffered a major hack in 2014.  Once the world's largest bitcoin exchange by trading volume, Mt. Gox was breached in February 2014, which resulted in an initial loss of 850,000 bitcoin, worth over $400 million at the time, some of which was later found.  According to the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that safety issues already existed at Mt. Gox as early as January 2011, when two security breaches led to the loss of ""thousands of a Mt. Gox user's bitcoin."" McCaleb was immediately aware of the issue, but took no follow-up action and did not make the hack public, they claim.  The complaint reads:  ""Rather than inform the public that these users were not refunded, nor stay to repair the security issues, McCaleb sold a majority of his interest in Mt. Gox to Mark Karpeles.""  Karpeles took over Mt. Gox as CEO around March 2011, but had to file for bankruptcy three years later following the notorious hack. He has since faced a trial in Tokyo over his role in the collapse, being found guilty of data manipulation, but innocent of embezzlement.  The plaintiffs argue that McCaleb knowingly hid known security issues while continuing to promote and represent the exchange as a secure, safe platform with good liquidity.  ""In deciding to use Mt. Gox as offered by Defendants, Plaintiff accepted as true the totality of representations and omissions made by representatives from Defendants that Defendants were uniquely qualified to properly provide the services needed to operate a successful and secure exchange per the needs of Plaintiffs and that Mt. Gox was properly funded,"" the plaintiffs said.  As such, the two have filed their claim with the court, seeking punitive damages and general damages, among others, to compensate for their loss resulting from McCaleb's alleged misrepresentation of Mt. Gox.  McCaleb – who has become known as the creator of the stellar cryptocurrency since the Mt. Gox days – said in an email response:  ""The idea that I was somehow to blame for the demise of Mt. Gox, three whole years after I had anything to do with the site, is completely ridiculous. The amount missing when Mark took over was relatively minor and he was fully aware of it. Mark ran the site into the ground. He managed to have 100s of thousands of bitcoins stolen from him without ever even checking his wallet balance. He was clearly totally incompetent and this is why the site went bankrupt not because of anything else.This is why these people lost their money. The suit is frivolous and just a money grab by unscrupulous people.""  More than five years after Mt. Gox filed for liquidation, the case is now in rehabilitation, with creditors having been granted the right to receive their lost funds in the original bitcoin, instead of fiat currencies arising from the liquidation of bitcoin by Mt. Gox's trustee.  Read the full complaint below:    Steinmetz, Jones v.s.

42382202,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtZZ,1561536010,Amun Launches Exchange-Traded Product Using Bitwise Crypto Index,"Swiss-based fintech firm Amun AG has released plans to launch a new exchange-traded product (ETP) that will use the Bitwise 10 Select Large Cap Crypto Index as a benchmark. This is the fifth ETP the Swiss SIX Exchange has permitted.  Bitwise  Index Services, a subsidiary of Bitwise Asset Management, licenced its index for the first physically replicated crypto index product. The Amun Bitwise Select 10 Large Cap Crypto ETP is available to anyone outside the U.S., and will trade with the ticker symbol KEYS.  “We are thrilled to partner with Bitwise to bring the most broadly diversified crypto ETP to investors in Switzerland,” said Hany Rashwan, CEO of Amun. “Bitwise is the global leader in crypto indexing, and we are excited to launch a product that builds on their expertise.”  Bitwise develops, calculates, disseminates, and licenses cryptocurrency indexes and conducts research in the area of cryptocurrency investing. Its parent company Bitwise Asset Management created the first crypto index available exclusively to U.S. investors.  The Bitwise 10 Select Large Cap Crypto Index is designed to track the performance of up to 10 of the largest crypto assets in the world, as measured and weighted by free-float and inflation-adjusted market capitalization. Though it excludes privacy coins and Platform Dependent Tokens on third-party blockchains.  Constituent securities must meet a variety of criteria to qualify for the Index, including rules related to security, liquidity and institutional support, according to the press release. The Index is rebalanced and reconstituted on a monthly basis.  As of a rebalancing on May 31, the index is weighted with Bitcoin comprising 67.8 percent, Ethereum 11.5 percent, Ripple 8.33 percent, and Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and EOS comprising around 3 percent. Stellar and Cardano represent around 1 percent of the basket.  To serve as the underlying assets of the ETP, the index must be approved by SIX and must be both supported by appropriate market makers and available for custody at leading institutional custodians. Currently only eight cryptos make all the requirements.  However, “SIX is a forward-thinking regulator, however, and as the space matures, we expect to see more assets qualify,” said Matthew Hougan, Global Head of Research at Bitwise.  Coinbase Custody and Kingdom Trust currently serve as custodians, though the market makers have not been disclosed yet.  Amun previously released a number of crypto ETPs on the Swiss national market, including one holding the top five cryptocurrencies in a basket (HODL), and ones holding Bitcoin (ABTC), Ethereum (AETH), and Ripple (AXRP).  “Crypto is moving forward on its journey to becoming a mainstream, regulated financial asset,” said Hougan. “Nasdaq Nordic has also allowed crypto ETPs to launch, and regulators are deeply engaged in the US, Europe, and Canada.

42382222,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtsR,1561528053,Bitcoin Price Hits 17-Month High Above $12.9K,"Views:  Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $12,900 for the first time in over 17 months backed by consistent levels of volume.  Recent price action could set scope for $13,700 in the coming day on the back of strong bullish momentum.  The hourly chart reveals extreme levels of volatility presenting harsh trading conditions for the average trader.      Bitcoin has risen above $12,900 for the first time since Jan. 21, 2018, touching a new high for 2019 at $12,919, according to CoinDesk's BPI data.  On June 26 at 03:00 UTC, Bitcoin broke out from a bullish pattern, rising in quick succession above $12,000 on strong momentum and high volatility. As of press time, the price has dropped back to above $12,500.  The last time bitcoin (BTC) changed hands above $12,000 in January 2018, prices were on the way down, amid the beginnings of a down trending bear market. This time, things are much different.  BTC continues to post impressive results up 40 percent in the month of June alone, while its year-to-year performance is up by more than 250 percent, according to data at Messari.io.  Hourly chart  The hourly chart reveals BTC's recent movements in a bullish light as each breakout was backed by a strong showing of growing volume.  As can be seen above, prices broke from an ascending triangle (typically bullish in nature) on June 25 at 21:00 UTC backed by consistent levels of growing volume, legitimizing the move on its rise northward.  A secondary ascending triangle breakout brought prices well above $12,000 and continues to eye off $13,100 in the immediate short-term, as per Fibonacci Extension theory.  The recent volatility may also see a short-term move to retest $12,500 given the levels of liquidity currently entering and exiting the markets in rapid succession.  Weekly chart  The weekly chart also reveals some interesting insights, detailing key levels of support and resistance at $11,500 and $13,700 respectively, whereby a close above or below those levels would dictate the direction of the trend for either a continuation or a pullback in its price.  In addition, there has been a strong backing of weekly volume since the new year began, with the exception given to March, that saw below-average volume traded over the month. This is a good sign for the bulls as the moves are backed by strong liquidity and buying pressure.  If momentum and market conditions maintain their current course, BTC could set its sights on $13,500 resistance in the coming days.  Should prices fall below $11,500 then consider a retest of the $11,000 psychological support zone, overall the trend remains very bullish.

42421061,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXC4o1,1561521641,What Indonesia Reveals About Facebook's Cryptocurrency Ambitions,"Facebook published plans for the Libra cryptocurrency in seven languages, including Indonesia’s Bahasa – a move that offers perhaps the clearest glimpse of what Facebook’s fintech ascent might look like.  “Indonesia has the fourth-highest number of Facebook users in the world,” Pang Xue Kai, co-founder of the Indonesian crypto exchange Tokocrypto, told CoinDesk. “If Facebook’s Libra can address the [local] issues, it has the potential to succeed.”  According to the annual media report released by We Are Social and Hootsuitehttps://wearesocial.com/global-digital-report-2019, Indonesia has the world’s highest rate of Facebook post engagement among internet users, over 4 percent, and the highest frequency of online shopping, with 86 percent of Indonesian survey respondents saying they bought something online in the past month.  Since nearly 10 percent of Indonesian respondents said they also own some cryptocurrency, double American percentage, Facebook couldn’t have dreamed up a better market for Libra.  QCP Capital co-founder Joshua Ho, a trader who works closely with Indonesian exchange Tokocrypto, told CoinDesk Facebook’s Libra ecosystem could be a “gamechanger” in Indonesia.  “People are already very aligned with mobile payments,” Ho said. “It is geographically decentralized. Creating banking access is a huge challenge.”  Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, which sparked rampant inflation, economic recession and political turmoil in Indonesia, Ho said cryptocurrency offers an attractive alternative to fiat currencies and banks the population still distrusts.  Add all this to the World Bank’s estimate that Indonesia is a collection of islands with one of the world’s largest unbanked populations, 97 million adults as of 2017, and it’s clear why Facebook prioritized publishing its crypto materials in the native language.  Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley, a founding member of the Libra Association, told CoinDesk getting merchants to accept Libra will be a crucial part of encouraging adoption among the unbanked. The Andreessen Horowitz–backed startup will primarily contribute to security and custody features for the Libra ecosystem, especially custody services related to the Libra investment token for institutional investors.  McCauley said Anchorage is currently applying for various licenses, but declined to specify which. He said he did not believe the association or its members would require additional licenses for money transmission or custody features for retail users in various jurisdictions.  Although Facebook’s dominance across Indonesia’s communication networks is growing rapidly, accessibility can still be hindered by government intervention.  “Of course the platform that facilitated a transaction is going to know who the transaction is coming from, who it is going to, and will have the ability to enforce whatever norms, laws or regulations that they need to do so,” McCauley said. “That tends to be jurisdiction dependent and client dependent.”  Privacy risks  Facebook’s omnipresence in Indonesia raises questions about how Libra will impact retail users.  For example, TechCrunch reported the Indonesian government censored access to WhatsApp and Instagram, both owned by Facebook, in May when protests about controversial election results turned violent. Numerous reports have called Facebook a political “battleground” in Indonesia, where data from over a million user accounts was reportedly sold to Cambridge Analytica for targeted political campaigns.  A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on how relations with local authorities evolved since the protests in May, focusing instead on partnerships forged with six fact-checking entities certified by the Poynter Institute to quell the spread of misinformation among Indonesian users.  This type of scenario raises red flags for Cornell University professor and blockchain researcher Emin Gun Sirer.  “I did not see anything in their roadmap related to privacy at all,” he told CoinDesk about the Libra Association. “I don’t think people are talking about how aggressive the Facebook approach is.”  A blog post by the crypto startup Nym went even further. Nym’s CTO, Dave Hrycyszyn, was briefly with the social media giant after the acqui-hire of Chainspace, a startup he co-founded.  “Libra will provide Facebook and its partners with the ability to analyze every purchase by every single Libra user,” the blog post said:  “While Facebook currently promises that it will not triangulate its vast hordes of personal data with financial transaction information to probe ever deeper into the minds of its human subjects, there are no cryptographic or technical privacy guarantees in Libra to prevent Facebook from doing exactly this.”  Social ecosystem  Mass reliance on the same provider for mobile communication and financial access would give Silicon Valley even more leverage in markets like Indonesia.  CoinDesk contributor Daniel Evans noted Facebook’s Libra Association doesn’t have any partners in the region yet and may not be able to operate “freely.”  Shaun Djie, co-founder of Tokocrypto’s Singapore-based partner, DigixGlobal, told CoinDesk the fintech ecosystem in Indonesia is currently “very malleable” as young people are “receptive to owning cryptocurrencies.” In general, crypto veterans with experience in the Indonesian market were optimistically curious about Libra.  Regardless of privacy concerns, WhatsApp and Instagram would inherently be huge factors in the local Libra ecosystem. Ho confirmed that WhatsApp, with roughly 70 million Indonesian users, is a pivotal tool for local businesses.

42382206,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtdL,1561510824,Tim Draper Is Bullish On Argentina's Blockchain Tech Potential,"In a talk at the Bitcoin2019 conference, Tim Draper revealed his perspective on the implications of his ""joke"" bet with Argentina’s current president which he made this year during a trip to South America.  He made the bet during a visit to Argentina, where he met with the Argentinian leader and talked about the benefits of cryptocurrency, encouraging him to legalize bitcoin.  The conversation covered the devaluation of the Argentinian peso and quickly escalated to a wager: if Bitcoin gets to be more valuable than the peso by 2023, Argentina's leader would declare it a national currency.  Draper said that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 between 2022 and 2023, outpacing the entire currency market by far.  ""Bitcoin will own a 5% of the global currency market. This will definitely happen,"" Draper said.  While it is not clear if the President agreed to the bet, the venture capitalist assured journalists that the proposal was a joke.  ""People are going to choose bitcoin over pesos when they see all they can do with bitcoin. That's why I made the prediction and then the bet as a joke with the President,"" Draper said.  The Bet On Argentina  Draper is bullish on Argentina but is worried about the President's future.  ""His popularity is going down,"" Draper said during the panel.  The Argentinian peso is currently facing a projected 36% devaluation by the end of 2019. Macri's government also faces a public debt rise of 77 percent, the highest in Latin America. According to Draper, the solution lies in making Argentina open to investment.  ""The only way to grow is to be the country all the entrepreneurs want to go to. This is one of those moments when a President can have an important impact on his country,"" Draper said.  On the other hand, the investor does have great expectations for the Argentinian startup industry and invested $3 million so far into Argentinian entrepreneurship.  According to Draper, a real investment in Argentina's tech infrastructure is key. He told the South American leader that the implementation of 5G wireless in the country was imperative.  ""I think it's time to attract investors and venture capital to continue the progress, otherwise the status quo remains and it could lead to a collapse,"" Draper said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Diana Aguilar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/26/tim-draper-is-bullish-on-argentinas-blockchain-tech-potential,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a176c30b283a43e6d815523a6a7bebce0f9fdd2-1171x656.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382220,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qtux,1561509269,Bitcoin’s Share of $350 Billion Crypto Market Highest Since 2017,"Bitcoin has done it again, hitting a new 2019 high above $12,000 before retracing slightly.  At 21:00 UTC on June 25, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization broke from sideways trading after being held beneath $11,400 for over 11 hours.  However, perhaps most notable is the fact that bitcoin also crossed above 60 percent market dominance for the first time in over 17 months.  A metric maintained by data provider CoinMarketCap, the Bitcoin Dominance Index shows bitcoin continues to gain altitude at a time when broader confidence in the crypto market, now nearly $350 billion, has yet to return.  The move to fresh 2019 highs is further a welcome sight for the bulls who continue to enjoy the incredible 230 percent gains experienced from the beginning of this year.  Notably, the price rally was also accompanied by an uptick in the 24-hour trading volume as an increase of $13.8 billion was added overall, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  However, its “Real 10” volume – a metric that takes into account trading volume from exchanges reporting honest volume figures as identified in a report by Bitwise Asset Management, is delivering more sober results, currently standing up $4.09 billion, according to Messari.io.  Dominance Rate  Still, bitcoin’s dominance may be the broader story.  At press time, bitcoin’s market capitalization now records $202.8 billion, which is about $67.1 million more than the market capitalization of every other cryptocurrency combined - which currently stands at $135.7 billion.  Meanwhile, other highly ranked cryptocurrencies like NEO, Ether (ETH) and Ontology (ONT) have gained between 2 to 10 percent value on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap.  Eyes are now firmly set on bitcoin’s new target along the $12,0000 psychological price tag, last seen 17 months ago on Jan 28, 2018, signaling a very strong upward toward its all-time high near $20,000.
