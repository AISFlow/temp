42378887,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJkH,1476309346,"So, It Looks Like Ethereum is Going to Have to Fork Again...","Déjà vu?  Although there isn't a timeline yet, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin today suggested that the platform's developers may have to hard fork to once again solve pressing network problems. If pursued, the move would come less than three months after ethereum last executed a hard fork in a controversial bid to return funds to investors in The DAO.  Despite the potential risks (last time, the upgrade didn't go as planned), the new fork seems to have initial support, as it is seen as a way to foil ongoing attacks on the network.  In recent weeks, the ethereum blockchain has been barraged with a series of denial of service attacks, which have slowed transactions and caused nodes to crash. Exchanges like Kraken and ShapeShift have temporarily paused ether trades as a result.  Because of this, developers are looking for a fast fix to the problem, which has acutely impacted clients including geth and Parity, in the form of a hard fork.  Ethcore developer Marek Kotewicz, who works on the Parity client, noted that, a fork increasingly seems like the easiest option to stop the attacks.  He told CoinDesk:  ""You know, no one likes hard forks, but that's what I think we need to do.""  In the last month, developers of the Go-version ethereum client, Geth, have released six new versions to fix the various denial of service attacks to no avail  But rather than continue to create new releases (the team has averaged one release every three days), the idea behind the hard fork is to resolve the network issues in one swoop.  Uncontroversial but controversial  But it's important to note that this hard fork will likely be different than the one executed in the wake of the failure of The DAO.  As many ethereum developers see it, this hard fork is an uncontroversial change as it will boost security, unlike the last fork. Passed amid heightened drama and discussion, developers argue the most recent fork shifted consensus rules by altering ethereum's immutable ledger, making it unclear whether its smart contracts could be truly ""unstoppable"".  But since the next fork would bring a security change that developers expect to impact users positively, the feeling is ethereum's community is likely to be less resistant.  ""I don't expect much controversy over this one, technical forks are basically just 'updates' for the protocol and this one is obviously necessary,"" developer Zsolt Felföldi, who works on geth, told CoinDesk.  Not to mention, hard forks are arguably part of ethereum's DNA, as many in its community view the action as a way to upgrade the software in a way that supports its larger goals.  ""The ethereum project always stated that it will hard fork often to progress the technology,"" Heiko Hees, a developer working on ethereum's Raiden Network, explained.  In the eyes of many ethereum developers, this hard fork will look more like the hard fork to update to Homestead, ethereum's latest software release, which went according to a previously announced roadmap.  Felföldi said:  ""As Homestead was easily accepted by everyone, I expect the same here.""  Why a hard fork?  The attacker has been taking advantage of the way the network prices a function called ""gas"", which determines the fees used for accessing smart contract processing power on ethereum. Because prices are low, those familiar with the matter said the attacker can cheaply disrupt the network. This is what the developers are trying to fix.  So, while there are many versions of the hard fork in progress, the gist is the same. The fork will seek to raise gas prices to a cost that more accurately incentivizes actions that aren't disruptive to the network. (Some multiply the cost by 10 to 20 times what it was before).  For example, the top version of the hard fork, EIP 150, addresses this.  In the social media post describing the proposed changes, Buterin explained that developers ultimately hoped to adopt a more dynamic gas fee market that can meet the changing demands of the network. But right now, it's too complicated to roll out, and the team wants to push out a quick fix soon as possible to stop network disruptions.  ""In the longer term, there certainly are ways that the gas schedule can be made much more flexible,"" Buterin's post explains.  Outside agreement  Even those in other blockchain communities have argued that a hard fork is the only option.  A developer for ethereum classic, the cryptocurrency that only exists because it continued the ethereum blockchain abandoned in the past hard fork, also argued in favor of the idea.  ""With the upcoming Metropolis release, there will undoubtedly be more issues arising, so if they keep making small changes up to the metro release they run the risk of compounded attacks,"" ethereum classic supporter Vic Arulchandran said.  He agreed a hard fork is the best option to fix the issues ""ASAP"". (Notably, ethereum classic has been experiencing DoS attacks as well, and may have to consider similar measures).  Elsewhere, Blockstream principal architect Christopher Allen agreed that this is the most likely outcome.  ""They’re actually going to have to do a hard fork, with all the risks of a hard fork, to fix their own weight calculation,"" he told CoinDesk at last week's Scaling Bitcoin conference.  However, some say that there are still risks involved.  Economist and investor Tuur Demeester argued that ethereum could find itself in a situation again where initial support for a proposed hard fork erodes due to unforeseen consequences.  ""The hard fork that created ethereum classic caused a lot of animosity and a lot of dissatisfaction in the community,"" he noted.  On the other hand, his criticism is not directed toward the specifics of the hard fork so much as what he sees as ethereum's attitude toward security and how it has handled problems in the past.  ""I would be concerned that it's going to undermine the idea that ethereum is a stable network where people can actually deploy contracts that can sustain real-world business interactions,"" Demeester said.  Summing up the likely views of many observers, he added:  ""I’m curious to see how it plays out.""

42378867,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJXh,1476297231,Japan to Drop 8% Bitcoin Sales Tax,"Japan is reportedly planning to exempt bitcoin and other virtual currencies from a national sales tax.  The country's Financial Services Agency – its top finance regulator – along with the Ministry of Finance are deliberating on a possible exemption, according to regional news service Nikkei. Bitcoin purchases in Japan are currently subject to an 8% sales tax.  ""Discussions between the Finance Ministry and Financial Services Agency are expected to lead to a formal decision after talks by a ruling-coalition tax panel at the end of the year,"" the agency reported.  According to the report, the government is planning to use legislation passed in May that classified bitcoin as a kind of prepaid payment instrument.  The service further quoted an unnamed representative from a Japanese bitcoin exchange, who indicated that the move would significantly cut administrative costs.  News that the government might be pulling back the sales tax comes months after a lawmaker from Japan's ruling political party, the Liberal Democratic Party, pushed for such an exemption. In March, Diet member Tsukasa Akimoto pushed Finance Minister Tarō Asō to rescind the tax – a call that Asō reportedly pushed back on at the time.  The FSA and the Japanese Finance Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Announced  by ICICI Bank and Emirates NBD, the trial represents the latest efforts among banks worldwide to use the technology to facilitate faster, lower-cost transactions. Notably, ICICI and Emirates NBD are among the largest banking groups in their respective countries.  In one of the tests, an ICICI bank branch based in Mumbai transmitted a transaction, via a blockchain, to an Emirates NBD location in Dubai. The banks also tested a distributed ledger for tracking documentation for trade finance.  In some ways, the trials reflect the rising profile of blockchain tech in both India and Dubai.  India's central bank recently called for financial institutions in the country to explore possible use cases, meanwhile, in Dubai, the government has moved to back development efforts that could see real-world applications within the next several years.  For now, ICICI and Emirates NBD say that the trials are the first of more to come.  Chanda Kochhar, CEO and managing director of ICICI, said in a statement:  ""I am delighted that we are the first bank in India and among few globally to set up a blockchain application.

42378866,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJRP,1476285437,John Kerry Hints Bitcoin Training is Underway at US Embassies,"Bitcoin may soon be required learning at US embassies.  The topic of how the nation's diplomatic institutions are preparing for digital changes came up during a recent appearance in Silicon Valley by US Secretary of State John Kerry, a former senator and US presidential candidate.  Speaking at the Virtuous Circle Conference on 10th October, Kerry was asked about the presence of a ""digital officer"" at embassy sites in foreign nations. Specifically, the moderator inquired whether an embassy officer ""needs to be able to speak with fluency about bitcoin and dark web"".  Kerry replied positively, prompting the moderator to ask if the State Department was moving to update its training regime with those technologies in mind.  According to an official transcript, Kerry responded:  ""Yes. That's the curriculum we've put together. I mean, I haven't asked – there's a lot of uncertainty with bitcoin or whatever.""  While the comments don't exactly provide stark clarity, it's no secret that agencies within the US government are considering blockchain initiatives.  For example, a project called the Blockchain Alliance is promoting education among government officials, and the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is now providing grants to blockchain projects.  What the State Department's training looks like, however, remains to be seen. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42378870,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJWR,1476281141,When or If? Deloitte Study Explores Blockchain Loyalty Programs,"A new report from Deloitte explores how blockchain could be used in loyalty rewards programs.  The report  , released by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, argues that most loyalty programs offered by US companies face a problem, as they are underutilized and have high management costs. At the same time, loyalty rewards recipients are just as likely to leave a program due to a perceived lack of convenience, the study found.  Blockchain, according to Deloitte, presents a potential solution, offering a mechanism by which a loyalty program would function similarly to digital currency. For example, customers could receive reward points that can be redeemed for, say, an upgrade to a plane ticket.  The report's authors state:  ""In short, loyalty rewards are also a type of digital currency, so it is only natural that the engine that enables bitcoin to be transacted among multiple parties in exchange for services, goods, and even other monetary tender could do the same for loyalty reward points.""  It's a concept – using the technology to build more seamless, integrated loyalty programs – that has attracted interest in the past.  Startups like Loyyal have aimed to build platforms dedicated to this use case, while other firms, like credit card firm China UnionPay, have sought to explore similar capabilities.  In its report, Deloitte argues that blockchain can help cut out certain intermediaries in the reward delivery and redemption process, reducing friction for those looking to dole out rewards as well as the customers who receive them.  ""We maintain that blockchain will allow instantaneous and secure creation, redemption, and exchange of loyalty reward points across programs, vendors, and industries through a trustless environment using cryptographic proofs in lieu of trusted third parties and administrators,"" the authors argue.  Some questions do remain, however, especially on the regulatory front.  The report's authors speculate that ""blockchain could take millions of dollars of unused loyalty point liabilities off of balance sheets"", but that for now, regulators might not be so comfortable giving their approval for this new state of affairs.  Ultimately, according to Deloitte, the success of blockchain in the loyalty space depends on whether enough companies actually take the plunge and adopt the technology in a meaningful way.  ""So what are we waiting for?"" the authors ask. ""Well, for one, critical mass.""

42378868,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJVB,1476279061,Double Standards: The Coming Push for Blockchain Interoperability,"Not everyone wants to copy the world's most successful blockchain.  While bitcoin's public-facing, immutable ledger has proven resilient to attacks (and a mostly reliable way to transact peer-to-peer), businesses are still looking for something else to meet their volume and privacy requirements.  Yet, this search for alternatives has prompted problems of its own. In an effort to build products that meet diverse demands, using varied and often incompatible technologies, consortia have formed to help standardize the way financial institutions and enterprises build with blockchain.  At the core of the effort is a conflict over whether numerous blockchains with different technological features might replicate the complexity and inefficiencies of the current system, or otherwise slow down innovation.  Working behind the scenes in this delicate balancing act are multiple standards-making bodies around the world, as well as startups and corporations. However, it remains to be seen if these efforts will yield the desired results.  Ajit Tripathi, a director of financial services at PwC in London, explained that there's potentially more at stake in the act of making a standard than just streamlining workflows.  Tripathi told CoinDesk:  ""In any consortium, participants will always push for the standards that benefit them the most. If you push for a standard where your integration costs are lower than others, you benefit. Even if you're in a consortium where you're supposed to cooperate, there is an element of competition.""  In the act  Indeed, Tripathi noted that there's even some competition between the standards bodies themselves.  Among the efforts PwC has participated in include the European standards body ESMA's consultation on the applications of DLT; the World Wide Web Consortium's workshops on blockchain and distributed ledgers; and the US-based Object Management Group's (OMG) Finance Domain Task Force, which is exploring blockchain in the financial sector.  That's not counting both the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) and the International Securities Association for Institutional Trade Communication (ISITC), which have formed blockchain standards committees.  Most recently, the ISITC’s co-chair of the its Blockchain DLT Working Group, Gary Wright, noted that standards bodies are even seeking to sync up their various projects as a reaction to the kinds of projects so far created by financial institutions.  ""Most of the standards initiatives we have seen to date tend to be focused on particular target areas and be limited to the needs of local jurisdictions,"" Wright told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It will take some time before all the standards initiatives become aligned.""  He noted, for instance, that the group has reached out to the British Standards Institute to discuss how blockchain standardization might come to maturity.  Organic vs ordained  But in spite of such cooperative efforts, Tripathi points to the competition itself — both within consortia and on the outside — as a crucial part of the process.  He lists the privately developed HTML as an example of a standard formed more organically though the shear force of survival.  ""But to assume that standards will only come from bodies or consortia is a mistake,"" Tripathi said. ""Standards will come from competition. Google is a standard for search, but it's also a company.""  It is this balance between standards bodies, 'coopetition' within consortia and outright competition that Tripathi says is key to interoperable blockchains and distributed ledgers.  Yet, others don't see any immediate risk. OMG co-chair Elisa Kendall explained that her organization is currently working to standardize the language with which various financial concepts are discussed, including how to describe currencies, indicators and market value.  She added that while she doesn't believe there is any urgency to standardize in the coming two years or so, there may be incentive for some parties to do so sooner rather than later.  ""Sometimes it's in a manufacturer's best interest to delay standardizing as long as possible until they own a market,"" she told CoinDesk. ""Other times, there's so much thrashing around that it's better to standardize soon.""  Mess ahead  The secret to this balancing act is going to be how successfully the stakeholders weigh their ability to benefit from an effort with the overall industry’s need to advance, William Mougayar, author of The Business Blockchain, said.  Mougayar argues that there are many other reasons a company or organization might join a consortium or otherwise want to influence standards, including achieving insight into the how the technology works, educating the public and removing other barriers to development.  As more and more of these conversations take place and real change occurs — regardless of the motives — ""the trick"" is going to be striking that healthy balance.  ""This whole thing is about decentralization, so the whole ecosystem is going to resist anything that is centralizing. That is the nature of blockchain,"" said Mougayar. ""Yes, it's going to be a little messy.""  And Mougayar isn't alone in this estimation. One of the most outspoken critics of early blockchain consortia is Preston Byrne, founder and COO of Monax, which rebranded from Eris Industries earlier this month.  Byrne is well known on Twitter for making his own tongue-in-cheek announcements that mirror headlines found on CoinDesk and elsewhere, he argues standards efforts are today mostly about publicity.  Most recently, he unveiled in a tweet, the ""Hypermarmot Project"", described as ""a consortium of rotund, non-climbing, flightless squirrels preparing to dig up the gardens of the future.""  Byrne argues that standardizing the way companies use blockchain now would have a comparable impact on innovation as if someone had tried to control the bitcoin blockchain in its early days.  Instead, Byrne said consortia should restrict their efforts to minimizing duplicate efforts while focusing on creating individual innovation.  Byrne concluded:  ""I think when you see a consortium forming it’s because they want visibility and they don’t want to be the odd man out. That said, I think most the exciting work isn't being done by committee.""

42378881,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJgV,1476277364,Bitcoin Has a New Top Dark Market,"Dream Market is now the most popular bitcoin-enabled dark market.  The finding is the result of a new collaboration between blockchain analytics startup Skry and information security firm Terbium Labs, one that analyzed millions of URLs to identify the most popular sites for illicit bitcoin commerce.  The case study, released today, is being positioned by the companies as a countermeasure against the rise of new proposals from the bitcoin community, including those such as CoinJoin and MimbleWimble, both of which seek to increase user privacy on the public blockchain.  Specifically, Palo Alto, California-based Skry used Terbium's Matchlight system to identify the top three most popular dark web markets in the dataset: Dream Market, AlphaBay Market and The Majestic Garden.  The partnership is designed to provide similar kinds of insight to bitcoin companies, financial institutions and law enforcement looking to track fraud and other criminal activities conducted using products built on blockchains and other distributed ledgers.  Previously known as Coinalytics, Skry used Matchlight to index 3.7 million public keys that appear on Tor hidden services, password-protected forums, dark web markets, i2p, popular paste sites and many other places.  From 11,000 dark web URLs, the partnership identified 22,000 public keys, of which there were 798 unique bitcoin public keys.  The feed of URLs was then incorporated into Skry's analytics platform, where it underwent further data aggregation and processing to provide ""critical associative information,"" according to the statement.  In spite of the increased efficiency of efforts that track bitcoin usage on dark markets, however, bitcoin remains the most popular digital currency on the dark web, according to a recent report by two professors at the Department of War Studies at King's College London.  The case study released today, however, noted that other cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used in dark markets, including those with strong privacy features like Monero.  However, it noted that here, too, bitcoin plays a role, finding:  ""This allows criminals to quickly exchange into another, or even multiple other currencies, and back to bitcoin to cash out.""
