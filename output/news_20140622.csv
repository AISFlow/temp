42377403,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70Znt,1403441718,First Glimpse Inside Halsey Minor's New Payments Platform Bitreserve,"Bitreserve will be opening its new bank-like wallet and payments platform to some beta users next week.  The brainchild of Halsey Minor, who also founded CNET, Bitreserve is a low-cost bitcoin and fiat currency payments platform, aimed at consumers, where holdings in bitcoin can easily be exchanged and held in one of several fiat currencies.  The service will allow fiat-to-fiat transfers at zero cost between individual members, and a forthcoming API is expected to be integrated with payment processors.  To boost user confidence, Minor says transparency has been made a priority, with professional audits, for example, and a tool that will allow users to construct an exact balance sheet for the company at any point in time.  So we could see just how Bitreserve works, and whether it lives up to the promises, CoinDesk got a log-in to test out the system.  Bitcoin in, bitcoin out  Minor got the ball rolling by sending me £10. He did this by converting some US dollars held in his Bitreserve account to pounds sterling and then sending it to my email address.  In my inbox, I received a message with the welcome subject header: 'You've received £10.00!'. Within the email contents I found a link via which I could 'claim' the funds. Clicking this took me to the Bitreserve website to create an account.  What makes Bitreserve different from existing web wallet services is that it has no contact with the banking system.  As Minor says, it's ""bitcoin in and bitcoin out"", meaning a user can only fund their own Bitreserve account by depositing bitcoin. In other words, any new money introduced to the system must enter as bitcoin.  Sidestepping volatility  Bitreserve's tagline is 'the end of bitcoin volatility'. That's a bold claim.  The way it intends to achieve this is by allowing users to convert their bitcoin into any of five major currencies: US dollars, pounds sterling, euros, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen; with each currency being depicted as a 'card'.  A user can simply click a currency card and transfer the desired amount to another currency. Each transfer is charged at 0.75%, Minor said. This compares favourably to fees of 4.75% for an overseas cash withdrawal and 2.75% for an overseas purchase with a debit card from NatWest, the UK's largest retail bank, for example.  With transfers between currency cards, the idea is that users can hold their bitcoin in a Bitreserve account, secure in the knowledge that the money won't disappear, while also being able to cheaply access the funds in a variety of fiat currencies.  Big and bold  Members can send funds to one another at no charge, although, as mentioned above, commissions apply for transactions involving fiat currency conversions.  Like its tagline, Bitreserve's user interface is big, bold and colourful. It's also easy to use. Features like transferring and sending funds are clearly marked and can be executed within three clicks from the home page.  Each card also contains a list of all its transactions, with a drop-down menu allowing you to view each transaction on the public block chain.  For example, I sent 0.001 BTC (hey, journos aren't rolling in it) from my account to a CoinDesk colleague's Bitreserve account and could soon see the record on the block chain.  Bitcoin rates on Bitreserve are taken from Bitstamp. Product Manager Byrne Reese explained that when a user transfers bitcoin to fiat, the block chain transaction will show the funds being moved to the exchange. The bitcoin is then sold and the fiat is moved into the reserve.  Testing out Bitreserve has been a largely frustration-free experience, with the service appearing to work without a hitch. It will be open to a number of users who signed up for its beta release sometime next week, Minor said.  Reese said that the platform would be open to public access by year's end, adding that planned updates to the system include changes to the registration process for collection of KYC information.  Plan for partnerships  Bitreserve has side-stepped the potentially difficult part of building a bitcoin business because its 'bitcoin in, bitcoin out' model means it doesn't have to deal with banks. This is unlike end-to-end services such as Coinbase or BitPay, which offer links to bank accounts.  Instead, Bitreserve is offering a complementary service that Minor hopes will be integrated with the likes of Coinbase, via a soon-to-be-released API, for customers who are more interested in spending their coins than hoarding them.  Minor says Bitreserve will act as a ""classic reserve"", meaning depositors can park their funds knowing that they aren't somehow being synthesised into collateral debt obligations, for example.  How will this achieved? Bitreserve will make available ""the definitive record"" of its obligations to customers in a ledger it calls the ""reservechain"". Minor says this will allow users to construct a balance sheet for Bitreserve in realtime, a kind of proof of reserves test that customers can conduct themselves.  The other thing Bitreserve will do is publish quarterly audits, carried out by a Big Four accountancy, so that customers will know that the funds in the reservechain actually exist.  Transparency may be key  The two transparency processes that Bitreserve promises to implement mean that customers will also be able to vote with their funds on one of the main ways the company hopes to make money: by investing reserves.  As Minor told us a recent CoinDesk interview, Bitreserve's investment decisions will be public, so customers can pull their funds if they're not happy.  Minor makes lots of bold claims for his new company. If he can pull it off, a platform like this could encourage greater cryptocurrency adoption by blackboxing the potentially confusing aspects of bitcoin transactions, leaving consumers with a simplified interface.  However, just as Bitreserve hopes to work alongside vertically integrated platforms like Coinbase, it could just as easily face stiff competition from would-be partners who could implement similar exchange features.  Additionally, with protocols like Ripple fighting for traction, for example, multi-currency accounts are already available, and competing startups like Circle are surely working to make sure their services are as unintimidating as possible to attract the largest number of users.  It's Bitreserve's plans for radical transparency that might give it an edge, but those are precisely the sort of plans that are so difficult to execute.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | WALLET,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/22/first-glimpse-inside-halsey-minors-new-payments-platform-bitreserve,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0870269717ce3a7b7809fce15ffc7a3badd2bac-1405x957.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377416,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ZzD,1403438431,"Family to Travel Across the US, Spending Only Bitcoin","John Bush and Catherine Bleish began a road trip across the US with their family of four this week, during which they will only spend bitcoin.  Beginning in San Marcos, Texas, they drove into Washington on Friday, the first stop on their 'Uncoinventional Living Tour', for the Bitcoin in the Beltway conference.  The self-dubbed 'Blush' family will drive for four weeks and 4,400 miles, also stopping in Lancaster, New Hampshire for the 11th annual Porcupine Freedom Festival and then to Kansas City, Missouri – Bleish’s hometown – over the Independence Day holiday, before finally returning back to Texas.  They will shoot five episodes of their reality show 'Sovereign Living' during their journey.  Fighting a different way  Bush and Bleish are both grassroots activists that spent years fighting the political system in the US. Each helped start local political action committees that focused on constitutional activism, civil liberties and anti-police state causes in their hometowns of Austin, Texas, and Kansas City, respectively.  Deciding to build a family brought them to the realisation that they needed to change their lifestyle choices – opting instead to look for ways of being self-sufficient and building communities separate from government influence.  Bush told CoinDesk:  “We started to think that if we really want to change the world to create a more free society, the first thing we can do is to change the way we live and start to live more free ourselves, and stop participating in centralised or coercive institutions [...] Both of us began to realise that a lot of work we were doing wasn’t making us more free. In fact, it was just exhausting us and spending all our energy and our money and our time.”  The Blush family farm  For their first step in moving off the grid, the family started a farm, just outside of Austin, which has its own source of water and lets them produce their own food and harvest alternative energy.  For the vision of their lifestyle to be realised, they’ve set goals: to produce 50% of their own food, store 50% of their own water, and reduce their dependency on the central energy grid by 50%.  “That’s what the show’s all about,” said Bush. “Trying to document and educate people about the values of living a voluntary, natural life.”  Their show intends to document their lives as they learn each day from their lifestyle, their communities and themselves, as well as teach others how everyone can be self-reliant and free from government influence – without fighting.  After they’ve wrapped up filming for episodes five and six of 'Sovereign Living' they hope to be able to share it with the world through a media streaming service like Netflix or Hulu.  Planning ahead  Bleish mentioned that this is the first time in their experience where they’ve had enough tools and resources to live on bitcoin alone, citing platforms such as Gyft and eGifter, as well as the recent news by Expedia, as businesses that empower bitcoin users.  Nevertheless, she emphasised the large amount of effort it takes to plan a bitcoin-only itinerary:  “It’s hard, it’s taken a lot of pre-planning. I had to look at every single stop along the way and see what gas stations they had to make sure that we were buying the appropriate amount of gift cards for each gas station.”  For example, Bleish explained that, driving to the northeast of the country, she found Exxon gas stations at each stop, but on the drive back home there weren’t any. There were BP stations, however.  Despite the need to “really be on top of things” she added, “I want the world to know that it is possible to travel the country using bitcoin only. And it’s not only possible, but you can do it comfortably and take care of a family of four along the way.”  For the full itinerary and updates on the Blush family's trip you can read their blog.

42377417,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70a1j,1403434826,Jared Polis: I Will Protect Bitcoin in US Congress,"US congressman Jared Polis rose to prominence among digital currency enthusiasts earlier this year when he issued a satirical response to calls from lawmakers seeking to ban bitcoin – a move that was widely acclaimed by those in the community fed up with uninformed policies from Washington.  The March letter, in which he argued that the US dollar, not bitcoin, should be banned, also served to vault Polis into the position of 'thought leader' and 'unofficial spokesperson' for the digital currency industry.  In a new interview with CoinDesk, Polis suggested that is a mantle he's happy to embrace, both now and if he is elected for another two-year term in office this November.  Polis said that he will use his powers in Congress to fight against any attempts by the government to enact policies that restrict the growth of bitcoin and its burgeoning startup community, stating:  ""If there was an agency that reacted in an irrationally negative way to digital currencies, I would be happy to rally support [in Congress] to restrict their funding.""  Polis indicated the US legislature can help shape policies through its control of the funds provided to federal agencies and by exerting regulatory pressure where needed.  Still, while Polis sought to make known his commitment to the digital currency space, he was also keen to illustrate that he is not simply embracing the latest trend to raise funding and garner new support.  Rather, Polis framed his bitcoin interest as part of a lifelong interest in technology and the Internet, one that has now extended to include the wider digital currency movement, even if, at present, he still uses a credit card for online transactions.  Lifelong passion  A graduate of Princeton University, the 39-year-old former political science major said he has been actively interest in the Internet since its early incarnations in bulletin board system (BBS) and Usenet, a distributed Internet discussion system.  Furthermore, it was in college that Polis co-founded his first company, American Information Systems, an Internet access, web hosting and application service provider, though this was far from the last of his online endeavors.  Polis continued to chase these interests in his post-collegiate life, co-founding Colorado-based startup accelerator Techstars in 2006.  The program, which provides $118,000 in funding to its startups, also has notable mentors with connections to the digital currency community, including Union Square Ventures partner and digital currency investor Fred Wilson and Ben Huh, CEO of I Can Has Cheezburger? – a blog founded by dogecoin activist and community member Eric Nakagawa.  Given this exposure to the tech ecosystem, Polis indicates that he was immediately intrigued by the concept of a distributed Internet currency, free from government oversight, stating:  ""I certainly [had] heard about online currencies and bitcoin for a long time, and I think my initial thought was, it's about time.""  Campaign success  Polis once again found himself at the forefront of digital currency discussion in May, when the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) ruled that bitcoin could be accepted by political campaigns and political action groups, with some limitations.  Polis had been preparing his website polisforcongress.com for the news, and a result was among the first to begin accepting bitcoin, raising $1,500 in the first weeks of the initiative. Today, Polis said his campaign has passed the $2,000 mark in total.  Polis suggests the move has also been popular with his local constituency in Boulder and Colorado's 2nd District, whom he represents in Congress, adding:  ""The constituency I represent in boulder is very forward-thinking.""  A voice in Congress  To date, Polis says that he has been ""pleasantly surprised"" by the reaction of US regulators to digital currencies, citing the fact that the technology has been acknowledged by Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen.  Polis also suggested that members of Congress are beginning to become curious as to the continued appeal of bitcoin.  ""I've had several members of the floor of the [House of Representatives] ask 'What are bitcoins?', 'What is this?',"" Polis said. ""So, I've had the opportunity to explain to them a bit more about digital currencies.""  Still, his optimism only extends so far, as Polis suggests governments may not be permissive should the use of digital currency continue to grow.  He added: ""I fully expect to be unpleasantly surprised at some point.""  Governments will fight back  Despite the gains digital currencies are making with politicians around the world, Polis says that he fully expects more negative reactions as awareness of digital currencies grows.  This backlash, Polis believes, will be visible even in jurisdictions that have formerly been more supportive of bitcoin:  ""We haven't seen the full backlash yet, in part, because bitcoins aren't fully mainstream. But, as they become more and more mainstream, inevitably, they are in some ways usurping the prerogative of nation states, and I fully expect to see more pushback from countries including [the US].""  Despite this threat, however, Polis indicated that he will do his part to keep the US digital currency ecosystem informed while he remains in office.  Polis concluded:  ""I'll keep my eye on these things, and if I see issues and problems, we'll try to bring them to the attention of the bitcoin community"".",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/22/jared-polis-i-will-protect-bitcoin-in-us-congress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9a0e185e9d153c75ec4ea76a093732ac1d96de4-1000x1008.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377419,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70a5V,1403431248,"All Things Alt: Max Keiser Talks Altcoins, Investment and Political Disruption","The summer of 2014 is really heating up in the alternative cryptocurrency world. What will the next few months bring for altcoins? We can all agree that, well, nobody is certain.  To get a perspective on the possible road ahead, All Things Alt caught up with Max Keiser, host of The Keiser Report, guru for maxcoin, and one of the leading voices behind StartCOIN, a new altcoin-powered crowdfunding initiative.  Read on to see what Keiser had to say about alt investment, maxcoin and the inherent political nature of digital currencies.  The case for altcoins  Keiser suggested that altcoins are a great way for investors to diversify their digital currency performance. He said that he maintains “a diversified portfolio of coins, with bitcoin being the biggest portion”, adding that he believes “alts offer a great way to have exposure to different segments”.  He explained:  “Altcoins offer ways to gain exposure to different segments of the crypto-universe. Darkcoin is a brilliant coin that addresses a real need. As I said before, the market as a whole is set for 100x growth so there is plenty of upside.”  When asked whether or not it is ethical to promote altcoin investment, as large price swings can lead to losses, Keiser offered, “I'm like Warren Buffet. I talk about the coins I myself own including maxcoin”.  The future of maxcoin  Some critics have said that Keiser abandoned maxcoin, leaving its reputation – and price – up to the whims of market movers.  Keiser conceded that the development team was “overwhelmed at the launch”. However, he rejected the idea that the project was a failure and said that things are still going on behind the scenes that could produce some positive results if successful.  He elaborated:  “In the case of maxcoin, this was a coin that was started by students at Bristol University who I don't think were prepared for the huge interest they got but I supported them and continue to do so because they're very talented and we're still very early in the game.”  Keiser added that he thinks “we'll see a return to the old highs before the end of the year” and that “it’s probably a good buy at these levels”.  Bitcoin still the king  On the other hand, Keiser believes that while altcoins have a role to play, ultimately it is bitcoin that will remain the top digital currency.  He remarked:  “Let me be clear. Everybody should have, as their core holding, some bitcoin. Bitcoin is here to stay and is set to top $400 billion. I agree with the Winklevoss twins on this.”  Still, Keiser said that alts remain a significant part of the future of digital currency. He touched on the political ramifications of digital currencies, which ties into the concept of decentralization that is being realized in crowdfunding and eCommerce projects currently in development.  Additionally, Keiser said that alts – along with bitcoin – will contribute to the broader, long-term shift away from fiat currencies in favor of digital currencies.  He concluded:  “As long as Amir [Taaki] and his followers are around, bitcoin and alt coins will be pushing the political envelope and God bless them. We need as much political disruption as can get these days.”  Strange alt of the week  Last week, we looked at several altcoins that celebrated the arrival of the FIFA World Cup. While those didn’t fall into the 'unusual' category per-say, they were notable for the fact that they existed largely to promote a temporary event.  Perhaps these belong to a class of coins unironically dubbed ‘commemorative coins’, and it’s possible that we might see more coins of this nature as important events develop.  An upcoming coin release fits in well with this trend. Cantorcoin is an alt that supposedly celebrates the momentous (and, in many books, historic) political loss of US Congressman and former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary election.  With the slogan “Moderately Rare – Conservatively Secure”, cantorcoin has earned this week’s Strange Alt of the Week award.  Notably, cantorcoin’s max supply count is 100,614 coins. According to a development statement posted on CryptoCoinsTable.com, this number representing the “the 10th day of the 6th month of the year 2014”, which is the day of the Republican primary in which Eric Cantor lost his seat in the next Congress, all but forcing him to resign his leadership post.  Furthermore, the developer states that there is no premine, anticipating that the total amount of cantorcoins will be quickly mined and become “a collectible coin”, and adding that any available coins will “disappear quicker [than] water drops on Route 66”.
