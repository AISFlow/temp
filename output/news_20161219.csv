42379106,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwzN,1482179410,Inside Hyperledger's High-Stakes Game of Blockchain Marbles,"A group of global financial institutions and blockchain startups gathered online last week to play a friendly game of marbles.  But instead of using a virtual shooter marble to knock the competition out of a circle of chalk, the marbles were created using an early version of Hyperledger’s Fabric blockchain platform.  The dozen participants included the London Stock Exchange Group, IBM, Skuchain, Everledger and Loyyal, along with a number of other firms which asked that their identities not be disclosed.  Once the digital assets were distributed, participants walked through the process of dragging and dropping them using the Fabric platform, shifting them from account to account in what one participant described as a blockchain-based version of ""hot-potato.""  What followed was a first in Hyperledger history, and the next step in the business blockchain consortium's plans to create a production-ready distributed ledger platform capable of transacting any number of different assets.  ""These nodes are scattered all over the world, right?"" one person asked early on in the demonstration.  ""That’s correct,"" replied another as the token was moved in a transaction conducted by Gari Singh, IBM distinguished engineer and blockchain CTO.  To mark the simple, but notable event, IBM’s global blockchain director, John Wolpert, said:  ""That’s one small step for marbles, one giant leap for marble-kind.""  While a glitch exposed during the test demonstrated that there is still room for improvement, the general consensus among users was that the open-source technology would soon be ready to support an ecosystem of applications built by third-party developers.  ""It’s time for those innovators to step up and start building stuff,"" said Skuchain co-founder Zaki Manian.  A game of marbles  The test of the “marbles app” conducted at 10 am ET on Friday morning marked a milestone in the progress of the Hyperledger project, which kicked off almost exactly one year ago.  Initially comprised of contributions from IBM and Digital Asset Holdings, the ""Fabric"" code has undergone countless changes over the past year, contributed by developers from the more than 100 members that constitute the Hyperledger ecosystem.  Unlike the open bitcoin network, which can be accessed and utilized by any participant, Hyperledger’s Fabric is a closed system, meaning only credentialed participants can use it to conduct transactions.  The trial highlights how this works in practice. Leading up to the marble game, participants created accounts by registering with an email and a password. A private key amounting to a membership card was then sent to each recipient’s email address, and participants were prompted to download the necessary software.  ""That is so cool,"" said one of the participants, after a script was executed that launched a series of virtual marble containers ""Very cool,"" echoed another.  The rules of the game, once the users logged in, were simple.  Participants were allowed to create and trade assets between one another. However, they couldn't trade assets owned by any other party.  What ensued was a virtual assets war games of sorts.  Companies began with the digital hot potato game before being prompted to attempt ""illegal"" moves that were prevented by the terms of the smart contract itself. A ""show mode"" was also made available, revealing the architecture of the transaction in real-time animation.  From there, the group engaged in a ""free for all"", wherein they moved marbles at will from their respective accounts to others. This led to the next – and perhaps most pivotal – phase of the test.  “Let’s try to break it,” said one of the participants.  Heart in throat  In the melee that ensued, that's exactly what they did.  A yellow marble that had successfully passed from one account to another failed to appear in the account managed by UK-based Alasdair Blackwell, technology chief for blockchain startup Everledger.  The curse words quickly followed.  Each of the other participants saw the small yellow circle appear in Everledger’s digital bag of marbles, but Blackwell’s own account failed to display the asset. Had this marble represented the stock in a company, the title of a home, or a newly cut diamond from the Catoca mine in Angola, it might have been lost forever.  ""My heart was in my mouth,"" Blackwell later told CoinDesk.  One of the participants described the situation as a rocket blowing up on one of SpaceX’s landing platforms. It was part of the learning curve, they hoped, and Blackwell was instructed to conduct the lowest-tech fix possible: restarting his computer.  To the audible relief of those involved, Blackwell’s marble appeared. Exactly what went wrong wasn’t apparent at the time, but in conversation after the demo, IBM’s Wolpert positioned it as evidence of the system’s resiliency even when obstacles appear.  ""It failed correctly,"" he said. Blackwell’s appraisal was a bit less moderated.  ""It was a triumph of engineering and of teamwork, of people all over the world coming together and it working,"" he told CoinDesk. ""There were hiccups, but that’s expected.""  Looking ahead  Now that the dust from the virtual marble circle has settled, the data analysis is set to begin.  Over the coming weeks, Hyperledger members will analyze the results from the test, which were recorded as part of the software’s show mode, in order to “triage the ledger and check it,” as one participant described it.  Those involved will be able to continue their blockchain game of marbles into the holiday season, so long as they re-register every Monday. As part of the effort leading up to the launch of a production-ready Fabric, more formal ""connect-a-thons"" are expected to be conducted on a monthly basis.  In conversation with CoinDesk, IBM vice president of blockchain technology Jerry Cuomo compared the test to the early days of the Internet, when the network's total population could be distilled down to a single diagram.  Following the demonstration Cuomo said he believes the simplicity of the demo showed the potential application of the technology to a wide range of assets.  Ultimately, he added, the test was an effort to get real stakeholders knocking some marbles — whatever they might represent — back and forth.  Cuomo concluded:  ""The v1 fabric code is progressing quite well and we wanted to perform a live test to perform dynamically, in an ad hoc way, but with a set of rules to form an exchange for digital assets.""

42379093,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwj1,1482157942,France's Central Bank Details its First Blockchain Test,"France’s central bank quietly released new details about its work with blockchain last week.  The Banque de France said on Friday that it had tested the tech for hypothetical use in the management of SEPA Credit Identifiers, or identification markers used to establish the identity of creditors within the Single Euro Payments Area. The trial marks its first publicly acknowledged blockchain trial.  According to the central bank, one of the key participants in the trial was the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, a public-sector organization that acts as a kind of investor on behalf of the French government through a number of subsidiaries. Paris-based startup Labo Blockchain and several unnamed French banks also took part in the test.  Work began in July, the Banque de France said, culminating in October with the creation of prototype tools for creating and managing SEPA Credit Identifiers. The central bank outlined how weekly meetings were held with stakeholders as the project moved forward, going on to indicate that more detailed insights into the project would be released sometime next year.  Word of the trial comes months after the central bank called for more research into the subject, arguing at the time that any testing should focus on both the positive and negative impacts the technology could hold for the finance sector.  The Banque de France evoked this sentiment in its announcement, noting in a translated statement:  “This experience allows all the participating banks to share their analyzes on [the] impacts and opportunities of this technology.”  With the trial, the French central bank becomes the latest institution of its kind to test the technology.  In the past year, central banks in Japan, Sweden and Singapore, among others, have launched similar efforts, with the European Central Bank announcing a new research undertaking in partnership with the Bank of Japan on 6th December. Earlier this month, the US Federal Reserve released its first major research paper on blockchain.

42379107,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mx0d,1482156164,Making Blockchain Real for Enterprises: The Importance of Tokenization,"Julio Faura is Head of R&D and Innovation for Banco Santander, and is one of the bank's key leaders on blockchain technology development.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, Faura looks back on what he calls a ""remarkable"" year for blockchain development in the financial industry, and examines the challenges ahead for 2017.  As we wrap up 2016 and reflect back on how blockchain has been present in the agenda of the financial industry as a whole, it seems fair to say that the progress has been remarkable.  I am referring to what blockchain means for enterprise users – and for financial institutions, in particular – which is a lot more about leveraging the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies to make our accounting systems and transaction rails faster, more secure and more efficient, and less about the cryptocurrencies themselves.  And so, nearly every bank has now heard about this technology, and most would have at least a small internal group studying and fiddling with it. By contrast, this was mostly a forbidden topic a couple of years ago.  Well, if 2015 was a year of discovery for banks, 2016 has been a year of experimentation, where we have seen proofs-of-concept all over the place for many kinds of use case – be it payments, trade finance or capital markets. This broad testing has taken place within smaller banking groups, bilaterally or multilaterally within a number of industry consortia.  As such, it looks like blockchain is not a technology looking for a problem anymore, as there seems to be a decent number of applications where it can really make a difference, as the experiments conducted have shown.  Making it real  Following this logic, the challenge for 2017 will be to make all this real.  What does this mean? To start, it involves crossing the chasm from PoC to pilot, to then committing meaningful resources to take it to production. And in order to succeed at this, it is key to recognize and address the challenges derived from the need to integrate blockchain platforms with existing banking systems, which are often overlooked as we all get carried away by the excitement produced by the amazing possibilities that this technology brings to us.  In essence, the key use of blockchains, distributed ledgers and smart contracts in enterprise settings – and within banks in particular – is based on the idea of using cryptographic objects (cryptocurrencies, IoUs or data structures in smart contracts) not as stores of value per se, but as representations of “real” value assets which are kept under custody within a trusted entity, eg: a bank.  I realize this may not be the end-game scenario here, since at some point all value assets could be natively issued on distributed ledgers – but hey, we need to start somewhere and move on in an incremental fashion, since money and property are rather serious things and mistakes can have very severe consequences.  This construct is rather interesting for banks in particular, as it effectively opens a new innovation paradigm.  Building connections  Indeed, banks’ core banking systems are not well thought out for innovation, and this is more of a requirement than an outcome. Banking is a heavily regulated activity, and the fact that banks are the ultimate source of trust (as they keep our account balances current and safe) forces them to safeguard their ledgers very jealously, so it becomes really difficult to compromise them.  The result is a situation in which banking systems are buried in firewalls, with amazingly cumbersome operational procedures required to make any changes, and with ledger technologies designed for security and scalability at the expense of development agility and innovation.  And, you know what, I am happy they are this way, since it is our money that we are talking about here. But the beauty of distributed ledgers is that, suddenly, they give us a way to transact safely outside of these (very expensive) super-secure but cumbersome core banking systems, and this is not only because of the use of cryptography, but because of their distributed nature.  If only we could make a good connection between bank ledgers and the blockchain distributed ledger, we could then step up our innovation efforts on top of the latter, instead of stubbornly trying to do it on top of our existing core banking systems, which as I have argued are not fit for this purpose.  The key benefit is that, in the cryptographic world, we can innovate in an allegedly more agile fashion, using modern programming technology, and elegantly and safely describing business logic through the use of simple smart contracts, often with just hundreds lines of code.  And this is orders of magnitude cheaper, faster to develop, and much more universally accessible when it comes to collaborative efforts between all kinds of actors.  Tokenizing assets  And so, we argue on the capital importance of what I will call the “tokenization” of assets, which is the process by which an asset (eg: some amount of money) is locked under custody within a bank’s system and, as atomically as possible, gets represented in the cryptographic world, be it through a cryptographic token (an ""IoU"" in the Ripple terminology) or as a data structure in a smart contract.  Conversely, the reverse process can take place by which the user redeems this “token” to recover the value which is sitting within the bank in an omnibus account or custody deposit of some sort.  These two processes do require an integration effort with the bank’s core banking system, and it is crucial to show that this effort is not insurmountable – at least not in the same order of magnitude of the one required to develop new things on top of the existing core technology.  Otherwise, it would just defeat the purpose of all this in the first place.  Early indications show that these integrations should be easy to implement, as they only need a few API calls to: 1) detect the tokenization requests coming from the bank systems (eg: a transfer into an omnibus account), and 2) initiate a transfer to the beneficiary when the redemption process is triggered from the distributed ledger.  Of course, the difficulty varies depending on the degree of availability of bank APIs, but at least, in our experience, these integration processes can be achieved in as little as a few weeks.  Work on the horizon  Conversely, blockchain technologies need to be better fit for this purpose as well, which I believe will also be a major topic next year.  Besides the obvious topics of privacy, scalability and performance (including transaction speed and latency) – which are being enthusiastically addressed both by the ethereum communit, the Hyperledger framework and Ripple’s Interledger Protocol methodology – there is a particularly important topic about stability and immutability of the distributed ledger.  In the tokenization construct, a synchronization problem in the ledger becomes a true catastrophe, and it is crucial to ensure that forks do not exist or are kept very much under control – indeed, rewriting the recent history of the ledger can produce inconsistencies with the banking ledgers, which could be severe and would be extremely difficult to reconcile.  Going forward, and in order to start “making blockchain real” in the coming year, financial players will do well in collaborating with specialized blockchain startups to jointly solve these issues.  Specifically, work should be done on the issues related to the integrations with the banking system which will require extensive experience in both worlds – blockchain and core banking technology – with the ultimate goal of getting the tech ready to be used in enterprise settings to serve customers at scale.

42379098,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwpJ,1482152467,Why Blockchain Won't Be Connecting Banks in 2017,"Dr Gideon Greenspan is the founder and CEO of Coin Sciences, the company behind the MultiChain platform for private blockchains.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Greenspan discusses why he believes the inability of banks and financial institutions to collaborate will force momentum on new blockchain use cases in 2017.  As the developers of MultiChain, a popular general-purpose blockchain platform, we've gained a fairly broad view of the types of applications that people are building on this new class of database. And we also have a sense of whether those applications are a good fit for blockchains as an architecture, and if so, how soon they are likely to move from proof-of-concept to pilot and production.  For a startup with limited resources, these distinctions are crucial – they ensure that MultiChain's product roadmap is driven by genuine rather than artificial needs.  One glaring example is ""smart contracts"", in the sense of on-blockchain general purpose computation performed by every node. Despite the recent setbacks suffered by ethereum, smart contracts are still in high fashion in the blockchain world, not least because developers are naturally attracted to any new programming paradigm.  Nonetheless, we’re yet to see smart contracts solving real business problems that can’t be addressed by the simpler and safer technique of embedding data on a blockchain and performing the computations off-chain using that data.  So, smart contracts remain low on our priority list, but what's in their place?  Like many other blockchain platforms, MultiChain was initially designed to enable rapid movements of assets between financial institutions – or to be more precise, the transfer and exchange of the tokens representing those assets (removing the need for separate clearing, settlement and reconciliation).  Indeed, dozens of proofs-of-concept, including many built on MultiChain, have conclusively demonstrated that it is technically possible for blockchains to do this. And yet, despite all the success, we're not yet seeing these systems move to production in interbank networks.  One major reason is that, as a peer-to-peer architecture, blockchains require every participant in a network to see every transaction in order to verify and apply them to their own copy of the ledger.  For the majority of traditional finance networks, the resulting loss of confidentiality is a nonstarter, due both to regulations and the nature of interbank competition.  This explains why finance-focused startups such as Digital Asset and R3CEV have moved away from using blockchains directly for peer-to-peer settlement. Instead, the blockchain acts solely to notarize transactions and prevent double spends, using encrypted data that is visible only to each transaction’s counterparties (as well as auditors and regulators).  It appears that this situation will remain unchanged until we see a maturation of advanced cryptographic techniques (such as zero-knowledge proofs), which promise to finally solve the three-way dilemma between liquidity, confidentiality and disintermediation.  Where to turn?  In the meantime, there are other cases in which blockchains can act as a practical means of performing peer-to-peer asset transfer and exchange.  But, to assess this question for a particular case, we need a precise understanding of the level and nature of the trust that exists between the peers who would participate in the chain. On the one hand, there must be sufficient mistrust to rule out the possibility of one participant having full control of the ledger; on the other hand, there must be enough trust for the participants to be willing to reveal their transactions to each other.  To the chagrin of many a blockchain startup, the space of use cases between these two constraints is rather small.  One application that does appear suitable is managing the movement of assets between the subsidiaries of large and complex financial institutions.  In other words, using a blockchain as an internal ledger for multinational banking conglomerates. For me at least, this use case was a real surprise, because the question naturally arises: why not just use a central database in the institution's headquarters?  And the answer I have repeatedly received is this: each subsidiary is a different legal entity, and in many cases under a different regulatory regime.  Big business role  As a result, a subsidiary cannot be considered as the owner of some assets simply because a database in the parent company says so.  Instead, it has to maintain meaningful ownership of those assets, and this is precisely what a blockchain provides. A blockchain allows each subsidiary to independently prove ownership of its assets in its own copy of a ledger, and to control those assets through one or more private keys.  Nonetheless, the subsidiaries of an umbrella institution are in no way competing, and so can live with the transparency that a blockchain provides.  This all might sound like a bit of a stretch – one of those blockchain use cases which you can only make out if you squint hard enough. As the hype-averse CEO of a blockchain company, that was certainly my initial reaction. But by now, I’ve heard about too many internal ledger blockchain projects from too many independent sources to remain skeptical.  As far as I can tell, this is a natural fit.  Putting aside the issue of confidentiality, there's another reason why internal ledgers make sense as an early use case for blockchains: it's far easier to sell, design and deploy a blockchain project in a single financial institution, than it is to persuade several competing institutions to collaborate for their mutual benefit.  In other words, if blockchains are to be used for interbank asset transfers, perhaps when zero-knowledge proofs are sufficiently mature, then internal ledgers could be an important stepping stone along the way.  Banks can begin by deploying blockchains internally to test and prove the technology, and then open their chains up to other institutions once the market and products are ripe.  Long haul ahead  All this puts a different perspective on the hopes of many for a rapid transformation of the finance sector via digital assets transferred directly over blockchains, or to use the broader term, ""distributed ledgers"".  Even if we assume that this change is inevitable, startups raising and burning through huge piles of money now will likely fail to build a sustainable business before their investors throw in the towel. So, whichever role you play in the blockchain ecosystem, it would be wise to batten down the hatches and prepare for the very long haul.  Internal blockchains may indeed enter production in the next couple of years, but the broader revolution promised by this technology is far further in the future.

42379090,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwgV,1482148549,Will Bitcoin's Resurgence Bring the Banks on Board?,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  Two unrelated news items this week could, when looked at together, point to where bitcoin development is heading.  The first is that bitcoin’s price breached its previous annual high on relatively strong volume, and more or less held its position.  The digital currency has managed to recover not only from the Bitfinex hack earlier this year, but also from the Mt Gox debacle in 2013. This sends a clear message of resilience.  The support shows that governance and scalability problems are not enough to make a significant dent in interest in the cryptocurrency. And the relatively narrow trading band must reassure skeptics concerned about volatility.  With this performance, bitcoin is taking steps towards dispelling financial institutions’ fears that it is an unsuitable blockchain. While work will no doubt continue on private blockchains (as it should), this is likely to lead to an increase in banks’ interest in public blockchains over the next few months.  Changing attitudes?  The second item is that bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain has signed ex-Barclays CEO Antony Jenkins to its board.  As far as I know, this is the first time a previous chief of a big bank has joined a bitcoin-related startup. Is it a sign of bankers starting to engage with bitcoin? Or are bitcoin startups becoming interested in banks, the very entities the currency was created to circumvent?  Let’s face it, bitcoin wallet providers are already similar to banks. Most of us choose to leave our holdings in accounts at exchanges or with services like Blockchain, knowing that they are not the most secure or decentralized option. Why? For convenience, just as we choose to keep our fiat money in a bank account rather than in wads of cash under mattresses.  But banks are not like bitcoin wallet providers. They are not simple custodians or app builders. They are complex financial networks, powered by a wide array of users with different needs and priorities.  There you have it. That is what wallet companies such as Blockchain most likely want to be: complex institutions with a range of services that will not only bring resilience to the business model, but will also be instrumental in pushing bitcoin closer towards mainstream use.  Relationships between bitcoin startups and bankers will set both on a steep learning curve that will most likely end in a transformation of each.  The year ahead  So here are my predictions for bitcoin in 2017:  1) Banks will be less afraid of associating with the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has proven itself to be not nearly as volatile and fragile as they anticipated. They will be more open to collaborations, willing to test bitcoin-related functions and eager to engage with the community.  Private blockchains will earn their place in the banking structure. But the scope and security of the public bitcoin network will open up easy connectivity and new use cases, provide a relatively low-cost sandbox for testing new applications and help existing institutions adapt to new environments.  2) Major cryptocurrency wallet businesses will focus on developing more complex services in order to appeal to a wider base of users and to offer an increasingly attractive alternative to fiat banking.  In some cases, they will do this by leveraging relationships with fiat banks. In others, they will embellish the custodian services already on offer, joining forces with other startups to reinforce innovation.  Who the main players will end up being, I don’t know. But I am certain that the end of 2016 will come to be seen as a tipping point, the moment when the bitcoin and fiat banking worlds began to think about how to collaborate instead of compete.
